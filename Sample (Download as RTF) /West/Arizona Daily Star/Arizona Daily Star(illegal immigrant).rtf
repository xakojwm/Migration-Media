All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 As Nov. 3 nears, President Trump is reprising 2016 rhetorical strategy of hyping migrant dangers\par \par \uc2 As Election Day nears and polls suggest he\u8217\'20\'19ll lose the presidency, \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  has started hammering \u8220\'20\'1Ccriminal aliens\u8221\'20\'1D again.\par \par \uc2 For Trump, it\u8217\'20\'19s a return to form. When he rode down that golden escalator on June 16, 2015, to announce his run for president, he knew how he would separate himself from the 16 other Republican candidates.\par \par \uc2 He would go hardcore on immigration, talking tougher and more crudely about migrants and the border than any other candidate. He did it that day, setting a pattern for his presidency.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThey\u8217\'20\'19re bringing drugs,\u8221\'20\'1D Trump said of undocumented migrants that day, in his infamous refrain. \u8220\'20\'1CThey\u8217\'20\'19re bringing crime. They\u8217\'20\'19re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 To justify his harsh border and immigration policies, Trump and allies repeatedly associated immigrants, especially undocumented ones, with crime. He would pound that linkage home until his policies seemed necessary to keep Americans safe.\par \par \uc2 Migrants and crime, crime and migrants.\par \par \uc2 Trump mostly laid off that tactic in this year\u8217\'20\'19s campaign, preferring to highlight American rioters as a threat, but he has suddenly begun raising the specter of foreign criminals again.\par \par \uc2 Late Friday night, Trump issued a proclamation declaring Sunday, Nov. 1, a \u8220\'20\'1CNational Day of Remembrance for Americans Killed by Illegal Aliens.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The problem is, the association he\u8217\'20\'19s making is not born out by research. The presence of foreign-born, and even specifically of undocumented, people is not associated with higher crime rates in the United States.\par \par \uc2 Some studies even show that the more immigrants in a given area, including undocumented ones, the lower the crime rates.\par \par \uc2 But of course, some foreign-born people do commit crimes, and Trump has used those cases. He made an argument that was not based in statistical probabilities but on alarming anecdotes.\par \par \uc2 To understand why, go back to the 2015-2016 Republican race. Trump\u8217\'20\'19s team knew the appeal would work with a significant part of the Republican primary electorate, who were angry about the mealy-mouthed ways that candidates like \uc2 Marco Rubio\uc2  and Jeb Bush were talking about immigration.\par \par \uc2 One of Trump\u8217\'20\'19s top advisers early in the campaign, \uc2 Sam Nunberg\uc2 , told me Trump tried to contrast his views with the \u8220\'20\'1Cchamber of commerce\u8221\'20\'1D idea that even migrants illegally in the country are good and a net benefit.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CAll we hear is people saying, \u8216\'20\'18These are good people. They\u8217\'20\'19re here for a good life. They want to do jobs others don\u8217\'20\'19t do.\u8217\'20\'19 And we wanted to say, \u8216\'20\'18Oh, yeah? What about the other ones?\u8217\'20\'19\u8221\'20\'1D Nunberg said.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CYou want to go into generalities, well what about these specifics? What about this murderer? What about this rapist? What about this drug dealer?\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Bolstering their point, a killing occurred just two weeks after Trump\u8217\'20\'19s announcement that featured all the fears Trump raised. A Mexican man \u8212\'20\'14 in the country illegally after having been deported and rearrested in a sanctuary city, San Francisco \u8212\'20\'14 was accused of shooting and killing a young white American woman, \uc2 Kate Steinle\uc2 . The crime, of which the migrant was acquitted in 2017, became a flashpoint.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThis senseless and totally preventable act of violence committed by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  is yet another example of why we must secure our border immediately,\u8221\'20\'1D Trump said in a statement days after Steinle\u8217\'20\'19s death. \u8220\'20\'1CThis is an absolutely disgraceful situation, and I am the only one that can fix it.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 \{\{tncms-asset app="editorial" id="c2825f88-1ae4-11eb-82d1-00163ec2aa77"\}\}\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CAngel Families\u8221\'20\'1D take center stage\par \par \uc2 Much of the Republican electorate was thrilled by Trump\u8217\'20\'19s promise. That showed as he rolled through state after state in the 2016 primary elections.\par \par \uc2 The rest of the country, though, was not as receptive. Just as there is a persistent strain of anti-immigrant sentiment in America that rises and falls with the times, there is a persistent strand of pro-immigrant sentiment.\par \par \uc2 Then the so-called Angel Families entered the political scene. These were the parents and relatives of people killed by people in the country illegally. They heard Trump\u8217\'20\'19s message, and they reached out.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThey contacted the campaign organically,\u8221\'20\'1D Nunberg said.\par \par \uc2 The alliance that resulted between Trump and those victimized by \u8220\'20\'1Ccriminal aliens\u8221\'20\'1D colored the rest of his campaign and much of his presidency.\par \par \uc2 He upheld the stories of people like Steinle and family members like Mary Ann Mendoza as what results when you don\u8217\'20\'19t impose strict policies on the border and on immigration generally.\par \par \uc2 \{\{tncms-asset app="editorial" id="339f3704-1ae5-11eb-830a-00163ec2aa77"\}\}\par \par \uc2 At the Republican National Convention in 2016, Trump introduced the country to victims\u8217\'20\'19 parents, like Mendoza.\par \par \uc2 Her son, Brandon Mendoza, was a Mesa police officer. In 2014, a man in the country illegally, Raul Silva Corona, was drunk and high when he sped recklessly for a half-hour around Phoenix-area highways, finally striking Mendoza\u8217\'20\'19s vehicle head-on. Both of them died.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CMy son\u8217\'20\'19s life was stolen at the hands of an illegal alien,\u8221\'20\'1D Mary Ann Mendoza said at the convention. \u8220\'20\'1CIt\u8217\'20\'19s time we have an administration that cares more about Americans than about illegals. A vote for Hillary (Clinton) is putting all of our children\u8217\'20\'19s lives at risk.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Anecdotes, not data\par \par \uc2 In rhetoric, there\u8217\'20\'19s a name for the sort of argument Trump was making through these examples. \u8220\'20\'1Csynecdoche\u8221\'20\'1D (pronounced \u8220\'20\'1Csuh-NEK-duh-kee\u8221\'20\'1D) means \u8220\'20\'1Cthe part that stands for the whole.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Jennifer Mercieca, a professor of communication at Texas A&M University, told me about that and other rhetorical strategies Trump used in interviews in late 2019 and early 2020. Since then, she has published a book called \u8220\'20\'1CDemagogue for President: The Rhetorical Genius of \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 .\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 This was one of his more effective, ingenious campaign communication strategies, she said.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe reason for that is that at first he made a very general claim \u8212\'20\'14 \u8216\'20\'18They\u8217\'20\'19re all rapists, they\u8217\'20\'19re all drug dealers and some I assume are good people,\u8217\'20\'19 \u8221\'20\'1D Mercieca said. \u8220\'20\'1CThen he started using examples from testimonials from the affected families.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CA synecdoche is really powerful. It\u8217\'20\'19s a representative anecdote. You can mislead an audience by making it seem like the anecdote is more representative than it really is,\u8221\'20\'1D she said. \u8220\'20\'1CHe\u8217\'20\'19ll provide you with three or four examples, so it seems like an accumulation of evidence.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 That, she said, allowed Trump \u8220\'20\'1Cto paper over the differences between what the data show and what the examples show. It\u8217\'20\'19s not that the stories weren\u8217\'20\'19t true. The stories were true, but they weren\u8217\'20\'19t representative.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The Trump White House saw the power of those stories, asking the Border Patrol sectors to provide them and the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2  to publicize them.\par \par \uc2 David Lapan, the first DHS spokesman under Trump, told me presidential adviser \uc2 Stephen Miller\uc2  wanted Lapan to spotlight crimes by immigrants.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI was in a meeting with him where he said, \u8216\'20\'18We need to get more stories out about immigrants harming Americans, killing people,\u8217\'20\'19\u8221\'20\'1D said Lapan, who was in the job for the first seven months of Trump\u8217\'20\'19s term. \u8220\'20\'1C\u8216\'20\'18We need more stories to highlight the criminal activities of immigrants.\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe came out of the meeting with \uc2 Stephen Miller\uc2  and said, \u8216\'20\'18We aren\u8217\'20\'19t going to do that.\u8217\'20\'19 It wasn\u8217\'20\'19t our role to cherry-pick stories to highlight.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Research undermines crime claims\par \par \uc2 The foreign-born population, whether in the country legally or illegally, does not have a greater propensity for crime, numerous studies have shown.\par \par \uc2 In fact, research published in 2018 reviewed 51 studies of the linkage between immigration and crime published from 1994 to 2014 and found a very weak negative association. In other words, the presence of immigrants in any given area is weakly associated with less crime, not more.\par \par \uc2 The researchers doing these studies note they\u8217\'20\'19re talking about correlation, not causation. In other words, they can\u8217\'20\'19t say the presence of more foreign-born people causes less crime \u8212\'20\'14 just that their presence at greater degrees is not associated with more crime.\par \par \uc2 The most recent research, published Oct. 3 in the Journal of Crime and Justice, zeroed in on the relationship between undocumented residents specifically, not just the foreign-born generally, and crime in metro areas. It came up with the same result: More undocumented people in a metro area means the same amount of or even less crime.\par \par \uc2 Robert Adelman, the chair of the sociology department at the University at Buffalo, led that study as well as another one, published in 2017, that analyzed the effect of the presence of foreign-born people on crime rates over decades.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIt\u8217\'20\'19s pretty clear from the data that with both the foreign-born population and, in the latest study, the undocumented population, we don\u8217\'20\'19t find an effect on violent crime rates,\u8221\'20\'1D Adelman told me Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 With respect to property crime, they found a weak negative effect \u8212\'20\'14 in other words, more undocumented people in a given area was mildly associated with less property crime.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe\u8217\'20\'19re not saying immigrants or undocumented immigrants don\u8217\'20\'19t commit crimes. That\u8217\'20\'19s not what the study is about,\u8221\'20\'1D Adelman said. \u8220\'20\'1CPeople from all groups commit crimes, including undocumented immigrants.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Pima County Sheriff Mark Napier said sheriffs in other parts of the country assume the jail in this border county must be filled with people in the country illegally, but that\u8217\'20\'19s not true.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIt usually runs about 5% to 6% of the population of the Pima County jail at any given time (that) is comprised of people that are undocumented,\u8221\'20\'1D Napier said.\par \par \uc2 \{\{tncms-asset app="editorial" id="2cbfbcfe-1ae7-11eb-bd95-00163ec2aa77"\}\}\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CAbout 3% of the population of the jail at any given time are subject to ICE detainers,\u8221\'20\'1D he said, meaning \uc2 Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2  has identified them as subject to removal.\par \par \uc2 The probabilities, of course, are no solace to those who are victimized. Members of the Angel Families often make the argument that their victimized relative would still be alive if it weren\u8217\'20\'19t for insecure borders. That\u8217\'20\'19s true, as far as it goes.\par \par \uc2 But the same reasoning applies to almost any crime: It wouldn\u8217\'20\'19t have happened but for the circumstances that allowed the perpetrator to do it. Border insecurity, in that sense, is like drug use or drunk driving or lax gun laws or even parental neglect and abuse. Without them, the criminal wouldn\u8217\'20\'19t have done what he did.\par \par \uc2 Trump turns to gangs\par \par \uc2 Trump\u8217\'20\'19s initial focus on Angel Families gradually transitioned into a fixation on the idea that members of criminal gangs, especially Mara Salvatrucha, or MS-13, were embedding themselves with asylum seekers from Central America.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CMany Gang Members and some very bad people are mixed into the Caravan heading to our Southern Border,\u8221\'20\'1D he tweeted on Oct. 29, 2018.\par \par \uc2 There\u8217\'20\'19s much to unpack in Trump\u8217\'20\'19s claims. For example, there are the facts that MS-13 is a U.S.-born gang exported to El Salvador from California, and that it never had been a significant player in transnational crime, contrary to what Trump claimed.\par \par \uc2 But perhaps the most important aspect of his focus on MS-13 was that it justified building border barriers and clamping down on asylum seekers at the Mexican border.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe\u8217\'20\'19re here today to discuss the menace of MS-13,\u8221\'20\'1D Trump said May 23, 2018, at an event on Long Island, N.Y., where he introduced parents of children killed by the gang. \u8220\'20\'1CIt\u8217\'20\'19s a menace. A ruthless gang that has violated our borders and transformed once-peaceful neighborhoods into bloodstained killing fields.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Twice in 2018, caravans of asylum seekers began walking toward the United States from Central America, which renewed Trump\u8217\'20\'19s use of the rhetoric of migrants as criminals.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CHe needed the plot points to move the narrative along,\u8221\'20\'1D Mercieca said. \u8220\'20\'1CThe caravan provided him with an opportunity to talk about this as an imminent threat in 2018. \u8216\'20\'18These caravans full of people are attacking the nation.\u8217\'20\'19 That was really helpful.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 His rhetoric suggested gang members were pouring across the border in the caravans, claiming asylum, but that was hyperbole.\par \par \uc2 In the last six years, 2019 was when U.S. Border Patrol agents caught the most people they labeled as gang members: 976. That was one-tenth of 1% of the total number of people the Border Patrol apprehended that year, 859,501.\par \par \uc2 In other words, in the worst recent year, only 1 out of 1,000 Border Patrol apprehensions was, by the agency\u8217\'20\'19s designation, a gang member.\par \par \uc2 After Trump took office, Customs and Border Protection began announcing the arrest of gang members much more regularly. In fiscal year 2018, the Border Patrol arrested 5% fewer gang members than it had in 2015, but CBP put out five times as many press releases announcing in their titles the arrests of \u8220\'20\'1Cgang\u8221\'20\'1D or \u8220\'20\'1CMS-13\u8221\'20\'1D members.\par \par \uc2 \{\{tncms-asset app="editorial" id="b16d3bc0-1ae7-11eb-b556-00163ec2aa77"\}\}\par \par \uc2 It\u8217\'20\'19s probably not a coincidence that 2018 was also the year President Trump focused his rhetoric most sharply on gang members crossing the Mexican border. That year, he tweeted 22 times about gangs, or MS-13 in particular, as compared to 14 times in 2017, eight times in 2019 and zero times so far in 2020.\par \par \uc2 Victims of immigrants\par \par \uc2 As Trump and his allies have pushed to link migrants with crime, he has received steady pushback and mixed results on that narrow issue.\par \par \uc2 But the rhetoric has helped him justify and enact broader immigration changes, such as forcing asylum seekers to remain in Mexico while awaiting their asylum cases; separating migrant parents from children; slashing refugee admissions; and, of course, building border wall.\par \par \uc2 Through a variety of maneuvers, he has also succeeded at cutting annual legal immigration levels from about 1 million in 2015-2016 to about 600,000 in 2018-2019.\par \par \uc2 As one of his first acts, on Jan. 25 2017, Trump issued an executive order that included a crackdown on sanctuary cities and the establishment of an office serving the victims of crimes committed by \u8220\'20\'1Cremovable aliens.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 It was named the Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement (VOICE) office and served dual purposes. One was the defensible aim of providing information to victims of crimes by undocumented people about the perpetrator\u8217\'20\'19s status in the immigration system. The other was to make that familiar rhetorical linkage: immigration and crime, crime and immigration.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe rationale that made sense of it to me was, because the immigration system wasn\u8217\'20\'19t the same as the criminal justice system, having a way for victims\u8217\'20\'19 families to be kept apprised of what was happening,\u8221\'20\'1D said Lapan, the former Homeland Security spokesman.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1COn the flip side, what I wasn\u8217\'20\'19t comfortable with was elevating this to make it seem like immigrants were committing crimes above the levels of nonimmigrants, which we know is not the case.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Democrats pushed back on the establishment of the VOICE office, but it has persisted quietly, not posting a report on its activities since the first quarter of fiscal 2019.\par \par \uc2 They had more luck with Trump\u8217\'20\'19s efforts against sanctuary cities, from which the same 2017 executive order aimed to withhold federal grants. Cities targeted by the measure sued and have so far won their cases in federal appeals courts, blocking Trump from withholding money.\par \par \uc2 Iowa murder\u8217\'20\'19s aftershocks\par \par \uc2 In the middle of Trump\u8217\'20\'19s busiest year of linking migrants to crime, July 2018, 20-year-old Mollie Tibbetts disappeared while jogging near her small Iowa hometown.\par \par \uc2 A month later, police arrested a young Mexican man, illegally in the country and working at a nearby farm. Prosecutors charged him with Tibbetts\u8217\'20\'19 murder.\par \par \uc2 \{\{tncms-asset app="editorial" id="2cb27f2a-1ae8-11eb-8b7d-00163ec2aa77"\}\}\par \par \uc2 The outcry was immediate and predictable. Trump blamed her death on Democrats, a \u8220\'20\'1Cparty that puts criminal aliens before American citizens.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWhat happened to Mollie was a disgrace,\u8221\'20\'1D Trump said. \u8220\'20\'1CWe mourn for Mollie\u8217\'20\'19s family.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 But Mollie\u8217\'20\'19s family wasn\u8217\'20\'19t having any of it. In an op-ed, her father decried those who were trying to use her as a \u8220\'20\'1Cpawn\u8221\'20\'1D in promoting a \u8220\'20\'1Cracist\u8221\'20\'1D agenda.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe person who is accused of taking Mollie\u8217\'20\'19s life is no more a reflection of the Hispanic community as white supremacists are of all white people,\u8221\'20\'1D Rob Tibbetts wrote.\par \par \uc2 Her mother, who was separated from Mollie\u8217\'20\'19s father, went further. Authorities had raided the farm where the accused killer lived and worked, and other Mexican farmworking families living there had fled. Mollie Tibbetts\u8217\'20\'19 mother, Laura Calderwood, took in the son of one of those families, a 17-year-old who wanted to stay and graduate from high school in the town that was his home.\par \par \uc2 It was part of a persistent pushback in society toward Trump\u8217\'20\'19s immigration and border policies.\par \par \uc2 The breadth of that point of view became evident this year in a Gallup survey about immigration, which has been asking Americans the same questions since 1965.\par \par \uc2 During Trump\u8217\'20\'19s presidency, public opinion of immigrants has been improving. In June, for the first time in the history of that poll, more Americans said they think the number of immigrants to the United States should increase than said it should decrease, by 34% to 28%.\par \par \uc2 One more time with migrant crime\par \par \uc2 Trump\u8217\'20\'19s focus on \u8220\'20\'1Ccriminal aliens\u8221\'20\'1D waned somewhat after 2018. This year, he\u8217\'20\'19s stopped tweeting about migrant gang members, and instead of attacking sanctuary cities for their immigration policies, he found another angle.\par \par \uc2 The new big threat Trump cites is antifa. After the unrest over police violence this summer, Trump designated New York City, Portland and Seattle as anarchist cities and threatened to remove funding for this new reason.\par \par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal reported immigration dropped far down the list of issues Trump talks about. Some of Trump\u8217\'20\'19s allies began asking, what happened to immigration?\par \par \uc2 But as the campaign winds down, the siren song of the criminal alien is inevitably drawing Trump and his allies back.\par \par \uc2 Trump said of Democrats, during a rally in Florida on Oct. 23, \u8220\'20\'1CThey want to unleash the violent rioters, criminal aliens, MS-13 killers.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 In his new proclamation, he declared that \u8220\'20\'1CAmericans who are killed by illegal aliens are no longer forgotten, and we are ensuring that they will not have died in vain.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s top officials have been crisscrossing the country, brazenly campaigning for the president on the taxpayer dime. The acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, Mark Morgan, warned of an \u8220\'20\'1Cillegal invasion\u8221\'20\'1D if \uc2 Joe Biden\uc2  is elected.\par \par \uc2 Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2  even put up six billboards showing the mugshots of men along with a criminal charge like \u8220\'20\'1Cburglary\u8221\'20\'1D or \u8220\'20\'1Cassault.\u8221\'20\'1D Each person is labeled a \u8220\'20\'1Ccriminal alien\u8221\'20\'1D and each sign carries the slogan \u8220\'20\'1CSanctuary policies are a REAL DANGER.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The billboards went up, of course, in a state Trump won in 2016 and is struggling to win again this year \u8212\'20\'14 Pennsylvania.\par \par \uc2 It\u8217\'20\'19s one late test of whether the threat of the foreign criminal can still win elections.\par \par \uc2 'Rhetorical genuis' \u8212\'20\'14 How Trump manipulates public opinion\par \par \uc2 Jennifer Mercieca considers President Trump a dangerous demagogue and a rhetorical genius.\par \par \uc2 Mercieca, an associate professor of communication at \uc2 Texas A & M University\uc2 , spelled out Trump\u8217\'20\'19s main communications strategies in her book published this year, \u8220\'20\'1CDemagogue for President: The Rhetorical Genius of \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 .\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Here are the main strategies she says Trump uses:\par \par \uc2 Ad populum \u8212\'20\'14 appealing to the wisdom of the crowd against established leadership.

Agents waited for two days outside the camp, but could not get consent to enter the property. They then obtained a search warrant, entered the property and arrested four men suspected of crossing the border illegally.\par \par \uc2 In one email released Wednesday, an agent who No More Deaths volunteers believe is a high-ranking member of the Border Patrol agents union, asked the head of Customs and Border Protection to end \u8220\'20\'1Cdiplomacy\u8221\'20\'1D with No More Deaths during the June 2017 raid.\par \par \uc2 The second email indicated two agents with the Border Patrol\u8217\'20\'19s tactical unit, known as BORTAC, \u8220\'20\'1Chelped out in an advisory capacity\u8221\'20\'1D to \u8220\'20\'1Chit the No More Deaths/No Mas Muertes camp\u8221\'20\'1D in June 2017. That unit has come under increased scrutiny after they clashed with protesters in Portland, Oregon, in recent days.\par \par \uc2 The Border Patrol\u8217\'20\'19s Tucson Sector has released few details about the ongoing incident in Arivaca.\par \par \uc2 \{\{tncms-asset app="editorial" id="3741bcaa-d36f-11ea-8570-00163ec2aa77"\}\}\par \par \uc2 Roy Villareal, chief patrol agent for the Tucson Sector, said in a Friday afternoon tweet that agents \u8220\'20\'1Cdetected a group of suspected border crossers moving north from the international border southeast of Arivaca\u8221\'20\'1D on Thursday.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CAgents followed tracks from the group to a camp operated by No More Deaths,\u8221\'20\'1D Villareal said. \u8220\'20\'1CWithin minutes, agents encountered one illegal border crosser just outside the perimeter of the camp.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 A Border Patrol EMT evaluated her and the Arivaca Fire Department took her to a local hospital for medical treatment, Villareal said, adding the health and safety of agents, border crossers, and humanitarians is always \u8220\'20\'1Cparamount.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CLaw enforcement operations occur in the area around the No More Deaths camp regularly as this is a key smuggling route for both undocumented migrants and drug traffickers,\u8221\'20\'1D Villareal said.\par \par \uc2 He did not address the ongoing surveillance of the camp. The public affairs office did not respond to a follow-up inquiry .\par \par \uc2 Camp aids migrants\par \par \uc2 The camp was set up more than a decade ago to help migrants recover from exposure to high temperatures, dehydration, blistered feet and other maladies common to trekking through the desert. A recreational vehicle serves as the office, solar panels power a refrigerator, and a couple dozen beds, some of which are supported by green milk crates, are tucked inside large tents.\par \par \uc2 The Border Patrol\u8217\'20\'19s position has been that the camp encourages illegal border crossings and smuggling.\par \par \uc2 \{\{tncms-asset app="editorial" id="4665f106-d36f-11ea-953e-00163ec2aa77"\}\}\par \par \uc2 The timing of agents targeting a No More Deaths aid station so soon after the group released documents critical of the Border Patrol is reminiscent of the January 2018 arrest of No More Deaths volunteer Scott Warren and two Central American men at an aid station in Ajo.\par \par \uc2 Those arrests came hours after No More Deaths released video showing Border Patrol agents destroying water bottles left for migrants in the desert. Warren was charged with human smuggling, but he was acquitted in November after a high-profile trial at Tucson\u8217\'20\'19s federal court.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThis seems like blatant intimidation, from what I\u8217\'20\'19ve heard,\u8221\'20\'1D said Francisco Cant\u250\'00\'FA, a former Border Patrol agent who worked at various posts in the Tucson Sector and El Paso from 2008 to 2012.\par \par \uc2 Border Patrol agents generally have \u8220\'20\'1Cdismal training\u8221\'20\'1D in investigative methods, including how to conduct a search of a property, Cant\u250\'00\'FA said.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIf you can\u8217\'20\'19t get a warrant, it doesn\u8217\'20\'19t mean you can keep riding around a property on ATVs,\u8221\'20\'1D Cant\u250\'00\'FA said.\par \par \uc2 The ongoing incident in Arivaca was \u8220\'20\'1Ckind of predictable,\u8221\'20\'1D Cant\u250\'00\'FA said.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The last two years saw a rash of criminal charges against border aid workers in Southern Arizona, raising questions about the future of humanitarian aid in a deadly border-crossing area.\par \par \uc2 A road map to that future may be found by looking back on how the U.S. Attorney\u8217\'20\'19s Office went after cartel scouts and then expanded their pursuit to the variety of roles needed to support the scouts, according to an analysis of cases and trends in U.S. District Court in Tucson by the Arizona Daily Star.\par \par \uc2 As the U.S. Attorney\u8217\'20\'19s Office pursued charges against nine volunteers with Tucson-based humanitarian aid group No More Deaths, prosecutors in Tucson also expanded the scope of cases involving cartel scouts.\par \par \uc2 Those scouts spend weeks on mountains west of Tucson and act as \u8220\'20\'1Cair traffic controllers,\u8221\'20\'1D as one Border Patrol agent put it, for marijuana backpackers in the valleys below.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors broke new legal ground in 2015 when a judge ruled a man working as a scout on a mountaintop near Ajo could be charged with conspiring to smuggle marijuana, despite not having any marijuana when he was arrested.\par \par \uc2 Since then, scout cases have grown to include scout \u8220\'20\'1Chelpers\u8221\'20\'1D who cook and fetch supplies for scouts, drivers who drop off supplies, homeowners who store supplies, people buying groceries or wiring money to pay for supplies, and other roles.\par \par \uc2 If a jury were to convict Scott Warren, a volunteer with No More Deaths, at a retrial in November, he would be the first border aid worker convicted of felony human-smuggling charges in Tucson\u8217\'20\'19s federal court in more than a decade.\par \par \uc2 Judging by what the U.S. Attorney\u8217\'20\'19s Office in Arizona has done when breaking new legal ground with scout cases, any future trials of border aid workers potentially could see nurses, doctors, volunteers, or even donors to No More Deaths sitting at the defense table instead of in the courtroom gallery.\par \par \uc2 In the gallery\par \par \uc2 During Warren\u8217\'20\'19s trial in June, Susannah Brown bowed her head and pinched the bridge of her nose as she sat in the gallery of a federal courtroom in Tucson.\par \par \uc2 A federal prosecutor was telling jurors that Brown, a 67-year-old nurse who works with humanitarian aid groups in Southern Arizona, conspired with Warren and others to smuggle two Central American men across the U.S.-Mexico border in January 2018 and help them get to Phoenix.\par \par \uc2 Brown regularly treats migrants for a number of ailments and injuries at a shelter in Sonoyta, the Mexican border town south of Ajo. She and her fellow volunteers also bring a truck with a big tank of water to the shelter, which has an unreliable hookup to the municipal water system.\par \par \uc2 In January 2018, Brown attended to the two Central American men at an aid station in Ajo, known as The Barn, and Dr. Norma Price gave a medical consultation by phone.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors at Warren\u8217\'20\'19s trial also said Irineo Mujica, the operator of the migrant shelter in Sonoyta, arranged to help the two Central Americans get to Ajo.\par \par \uc2 Brown, Price and Mujica were not charged with any offenses, but they remained in the crosshairs of the U.S. Attorney\u8217\'20\'19s Office as Warren\u8217\'20\'19s trial ended.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CSo what the evidence shows in this case is that the defendant, Irineo Mujica, and Susannah Brown and the others conspired to further Kristian and Jose\u8217\'20\'19s illegal journey into the United States,\u8221\'20\'1D federal prosecutor Anna Wright told the jurors in her closing arguments, according to a court transcript.\par \par \uc2 Wright also referred to two No More Deaths volunteers when she told jurors that in the days after the arrest, \u8220\'20\'1Cat least two people intentionally went to The Barn and took things out, and they took those things out to help the defendant, and they handed those things over to the defendant.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Rather than make money, Warren \u8220\'20\'1Cgets to further the goals of the organization that he is a high-ranking leader in, and one of those goals, although never stated outright, is to thwart Border Patrol at every possible turn, to further the entry of illegal aliens,\u8221\'20\'1D Wright told jurors.\par \par \uc2 The Border Patrol also viewed No More Deaths as a smuggling organization, according to Agent John Marquez\u8217\'20\'19s report detailing Warren\u8217\'20\'19s arrest.\par \par \uc2 No More Deaths \u8220\'20\'1Cwas long suspected of illegally harboring and aiding illegal aliens and a search warrant for their illicit activities was recently executed at their humanitarian station near Arivaca, Arizona,\u8221\'20\'1D Marquez wrote.\par \par \uc2 He was referring to the raid of a No More Deaths camp near Arivaca in June 2017. Agents had followed the footprints of four people suspected of crossing the border illegally.\par \par \uc2 No volunteers were arrested, but they later said the raid and the surveillance that preceded it signaled a heightened level of tension between No More Deaths and the Border Patrol.\par \par \uc2 Warren\u8217\'20\'19s trial ended with a mistrial after the jury split 8-4, favoring acquittal.\par \par \uc2 After more than a year of arguing that Warren was part of a conspiracy, prosecutors dropped the conspiracy charge when they announced in July their plan to retry Warren on harboring charges.\par \par \uc2 Circumstantial connections\par \par \uc2 Marijuana backpackers have trekked through the desert west of Tucson for many years, often led by scouts using binoculars and encrypted radios to keep the backpacking groups spread apart, as well as to let the groups know if Border Patrol agents were approaching.\par \par \uc2 Until 2015, prosecutors would charge scouts only with crossing the border illegally.\par \par \uc2 But a judge\u8217\'20\'19s ruling in Tucson\u8217\'20\'19s federal court in 2015, followed by two 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decisions in 2017, opened the door for scouts to face conspiracy charges.\par \par \uc2 In the years that followed, prosecutors have charged at least 100 scouts with conspiring to smuggle marijuana, court records show.\par \par \uc2 As time went on, agents and prosecutors started targeting not only scouts, but the network of people who supported the scouts.\par \par \uc2 In one ongoing case, Border Patrol agents arrested Jose Angel Felix Ramirez, the suspected head scout for a drug-trafficking organization, in late 2017, and more than a dozen people accused of conspiring to smuggle loads of marijuana through the mountainous areas of the Tohono O\u8217\'20\'19odham Nation.\par \par \uc2 In that case, agents arrested scouts and backpackers; helpers who picked up groceries, batteries and other supplies at the base of mountains; drivers who brought supplies to the mountains; a man who let the scouts use his house in a nearby village to store supplies; a woman in Phoenix who bought supplies; and a woman who loaned her car to supply drivers and paid people to buy supplies, according to plea agreements.\par \par \uc2 As prosecutors expanded the roles that could be included in the conspiracies, they also expanded how much marijuana a scout could be held responsible for conspiring to smuggle.\par \par \uc2 Initially, scouts were accused of conspiring to smuggle the equivalent of one backpack of marijuana. As time went on, prosecutors started accusing scouts of conspiring to smuggle all the marijuana backpacks that were caught in the scouts\u8217\'20\'19 \u8220\'20\'1Cview sheds,\u8221\'20\'1D or line of sight, while the scouts were on the mountain.\par \par \uc2 In the Felix case, members of the conspiracy were connected to about 4,300 pounds of marijuana, prosecutors said.\par \par \uc2 Humanitarian conspiracy?\par \par \uc2 Under the prosecution\u8217\'20\'19s theory of Warren\u8217\'20\'19s case, he acted as part of a criminal conspiracy.\par \par \uc2 That theory is in many ways analogous to theories put forth by prosecutors in scout cases.\par \par \uc2 From that prosecutorial line of thinking, if an aid volunteer cooked for a migrant who came into an aid station from the desert, how different would that be from helpers cooking for scouts on a mountaintop?\par \par \uc2 If a volunteer drove jugs of water, beans, socks, or gear to an aid station in Ajo or Arivaca, how different would that be from a person driving bags of food, batteries and gear to the base of a mountain where a scout worked?\par \par \uc2 If a Tucson resident donated money to No More Deaths to buy water and aid for migrants, how different would that be from people in Phoenix buying supplies for scouts?\par \par \uc2 If a volunteer said they had worked at an aid station for a week, could they be charged with aiding the illegal border crossings of however many migrants were caught in that area in the previous week?\par \par \uc2 U.S. Attorney Michael Bailey, who took the position in May, declined to be interviewed but issued a statement to the Star.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThose who want only to give water to the thirsty should be commended,\u8221\'20\'1D Bailey said. \u8220\'20\'1COn the other hand, when one\u8217\'20\'19s true goal is to assist an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  in getting in without getting caught, such conduct is subject to prosecution.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Nine No More Deaths volunteers, including Warren, were charged with misdemeanors related to leaving water and food on the Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge in 2017. The charges included driving on unauthorized roads and abandoning property on the refuge.\par \par \uc2 The \u8220\'20\'1Cbottom line\u8221\'20\'1D is that prosecutors could not convince a jury that Warren was guilty of any charges, said Paige Corich-Kleim, a No More Deaths volunteer.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CProsecutors could try to cast a wide net, but they\u8217\'20\'19d essentially be arguing that keeping people from dying is \u8216\'20\'18furthering illegal presence,\u8217\'20\'19 and I doubt any jury would agree with that,\u8217\'20\'19 Corich-Kleim said.\par \par \uc2 Aid workers, Border Patrol agents, hunters and others in Southern Arizona have recovered nearly 3,000 sets of human remains believed to belong to migrants since 2001.\par \par \uc2 Andy Silverman, a law professor at the University of Arizona and a member of the No More Deaths legal team, said the difference between the scout cases and Warren\u8217\'20\'19s case is that Warren was not involved in illegal activity.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CAs they say, humanitarian aid is never a crime,\u8221\'20\'1D Silverman wrote in response to an inquiry from the Star.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CHowever, charging Scott and trying him for serious offenses \u8212\'20\'14 even though ultimately he should be found not guilty \u8212\'20\'14 has a chilling effect on people considering doing humanitarian work along the border,\u8221\'20\'1D Silverman wrote.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CBut it will not stop such work,\u8221\'20\'1D he wrote. \u8220\'20\'1CHelping others in need has been part of our culture and the threat of criminal charges will not stop good folks from trying to save lives in our desert regions.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Silverman said he would expect a \u8220\'20\'1Clarge public backlash\u8221\'20\'1D if prosecutors start charging all people who do humanitarian work.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe have seen it in the Warren case and it would even be greater if the government starts to go after, for example, health professionals, shelter operators and others helping people in the deadly deserts along the border,\u8221\'20\'1D Silverman said.\par \par \uc2 A status conference in Warren\u8217\'20\'19s case is scheduled for Monday, Aug. 5.

But not by complacency and namby-pamby, lengthy policy explanations. One of my favorite columnists, Pulitzer Prize winner Eugene Robinson, recently said it well: To beat Trump we must use simple statements of fact and catchy phrases. He coined the phrase \u8220\'20\'1CDepartment of Pithy Phrases\u8221\'20\'1D to outline how Trump invokes fealty, using repeated familiar wording.

After weeks of posturing, the Supervisors voted 3-2 in favor of accepting $1.8 million dollars in federal funds in Operation Stonegarden grants for the Pima County Sheriff\u8217\'20\'19s Department. Supervisor Sharon Bronson (D) joined Steve Christy (R) and Ally Miller (R) in the vote. The county has a record of accepting the grants over a dozen years amounting to almost $16 million. The Tucson Police Department has also used Stonegarden grants for overtime, equipment and other important supplemental funding.\par \par \uc2 Both sides of the aisle in all levels of government have become increasingly more divided, entrenched in ideology that precludes honest discussion about issues.\par \par \uc2 To continue moving our community forward we need something different.

Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning. All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 For two hours Tuesday, dozens of Pima County residents argued before the Board of Supervisors that accepting Operation Stonegarden money from the federal government makes the county complicit in racial profiling and family separation.\par \par \uc2 Thomas Torres was not available for comment.\par \par \uc2 Torres, as you may have read, is the 18-year-old Desert View High School senior who was stopped in a car by a sheriff\u8217\'20\'19s deputy on patrol Thursday night, then handed over to the Border Patrol. The nearly lifelong Tucson resident, brought here as a young child, was being held in immigration detention as his May 22 graduation date approaches. Late Tuesday, though, he was released from detention after a five-day stay.\par \par \uc2 What Torres\u8217\'20\'19 experience shows is, you don\u8217\'20\'19t need Operation Stonegarden to have family separation. You also don\u8217\'20\'19t need Stonegarden for racial profiling to occur, though there\u8217\'20\'19s no evidence that happened in Torres\u8217\'20\'19 case. In fact, the approval Tuesday by county supervisors of the Stonegarden funding came with new conditions, meaning those federally funded patrols are more scrutinized and therefore probably less likely to result in problematic enforcement than the routine patrols and investigations that make up most of any department\u8217\'20\'19s activity.\par \par \uc2 Like the patrol that Deputy Jeffrey Creller was on Thursday night. He was working in the unincorporated area where Torres was driving, near South Alvernon Way and East Drexel Road. Creller saw a 2006 Kia Spectra and didn\u8217\'20\'19t detect any traffic violations, but he called in the license plate and found the car had an expired registration and an insurance suspension, so he pulled it over.\par \par \uc2 Creller details in his incident report that he had trouble getting Torres to identify himself. Torres acknowledged driving without a license and gave an inaccurate Social Security number, but then he produced a high school ID with his name on it. Creller viewed it as evidence of further deception, but it more likely was evidence of cultural confusion on the deputy\u8217\'20\'19s part.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThomas was able to produce a high school identification card from (Desert) View High School. On this card was the name Thomas Torres Maytorena. At this time Thomas clarified with me, when I pointed out to him the misinformation, that he goes by Thomas Torres; however, his legal surname is Maytorena,\u8221\'20\'1D Creller\u8217\'20\'19s report says.\par \par \uc2 Anybody who is from Mexico or the rest of Latin America, or has even spent much time there, could likely have explained the confusion to Creller. In those countries, the common convention for last names is that each person has two of them: The father\u8217\'20\'19s last name first, and the mother\u8217\'20\'19s last name second, without a hyphen. Often people go by both last names, but sometimes they just use the father\u8217\'20\'19s last name.\par \par \uc2 Football rosters from Torres\u8217\'20\'19 high school career show he went by Torres then, too. So calling himself Torres, not Maytorena, was not evidence of deception, or \u8220\'20\'1Cmisinformation,\u8221\'20\'1D as the deputy called it. That appears to have played some role in Deputy Creller suggesting Torres was in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 The report goes on, \u8220\'20\'1CAgain, I very firmly but politely indicated to Mr. Maytorena, as I had now come to know him at this time, that he needed to be completely honest as to his true identity. I then began to indicate that regardless of the reasons he may be attempting to hide his identity and not be upfront, to include but not limited to him having a warrant, being an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  or having a suspended license, none of which would be acceptable to conceal his identity from me.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Then, the report says, \u8220\'20\'1CMr. Maytorena indicated to me that he is an undocumented \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Would it have made a difference to the deputy if he had known that Thomas Torres is his real name, not a deceptive one? I suspect so.\par \par \uc2 Torres was also arrested in early April. He was cited for misdemeanor possession of marijuana and released. The court filing on his arrest lists his name as Thomas Antonio Torres. Pima County Sheriff Mark Napier noted there was not confusion about his name in that arrest, and if there hadn\u8217\'20\'19t been the second time, \u8220\'20\'1CIn all probability he would have been cited and released.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 With the renewed acceptance of Operation Stonegarden money, there will be a series of conditions that Napier has accepted. Each contact by a deputy taking part in Operation Stonegarden will be registered and explained. No deputies will participate in Border Patrol checkpoints. Deputies will never be cross-deputized as federal immigration agents in the program previously known as 287(g). Each contact by the sheriff\u8217\'20\'19s department with the Border Patrol will be tracked. And of course, \uc2 Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2  has been removed from the jail.\par \par \uc2 These are significant concessions the sheriff has made related to the acceptance of Stonegarden money. But what about the day-to-day, routine patrols that have nothing to do with Stonegarden? The sheriff, when I asked him about Creller\u8217\'20\'19s stop of Torres, approved of his handling of it, and noted that it was the Border Patrol\u8217\'20\'19s decision, not the sheriff\u8217\'20\'19s department\u8217\'20\'19s choice, to take Torres away.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIf a person admits to being in violation of federal immigration law, I don\u8217\'20\'19t expect them to look the other way,\u8221\'20\'1D Napier said. \u8220\'20\'1CI believe our deputy did exactly what he should do and acted in a reasonable and appropriate manner.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 I\u8217\'20\'19m not so sure. I have no problem with the deputy citing him for driving without a license and other vehicular violations. But by his own report, the deputy asked Torres to say if he was in the country illegally, prompting the admission by an undoubtedly intimidated teen. And the deputy may have misinterpreted Torres\u8217\'20\'19 responses as being misleading. This didn\u8217\'20\'19t have to lead to a Border Patrol call.\par \par \uc2 Now that Stonegarden funding has been re-approved, but with conditions that will keep it monitored, it\u8217\'20\'19s these run-of-the-mill stops we really need to watch.\par \par \uc2 CREDIT: \uc2 Tim Steller\uc2  Arizona Daily Star\par \par \uc2 Document TUCS000020190508ef580000g\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 Opinion\par {\*\bkmkstart toc6}{\*\bkmkend toc6}\b \uc2 Letters to the Editor\b0\par\par\uc2 2,101 \uc2 words\par \uc2 7 February 2019\par \uc2 The Arizona Daily Star\par \uc2 TUCS\par A05\par \uc2 ISSN:0888546X\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2019 The Arizona Daily Star.

Many have seen pictures of women and children fleeing to the U.S. or men throwing rocks and other projectiles at the U.S. border patrol.\par \par \uc2 What should Americans make of this chaos? Why are there now caravans of \u8220\'20\'1Casylum seekers\u8221\'20\'1D and increasing numbers of women and children crossing the border illegally?\par \par \uc2 Surprisingly, the total amount of illegal immigration is significantly down from where it was a decade ago. In 2008, the U.S. apprehended just over 1 million individuals trying to cross the U.S. border illegally. In fiscal year 2018, it was just under 400,000 \u8212\'20\'14 and fewer illegal aliens are slipping through undetected.\par \par \uc2 Yet certain types of migration are increasing. Specifically, unaccompanied children and family units are up. Fewer than 20,000 unaccompanied children crossed the border in 2010, but that number topped 68,000 in FY 2014. It has dipped since then, but was around 50,000 in FY 2018.\par \par \uc2 The number of family units has also surged from just over 11,000 in FY 2012 to over 100,000 in FY 2018.\par \par \uc2 The number of requests for asylum and subsequent \u8220\'20\'1Ccredible fear\u8221\'20\'1D interviews has also spiked. In 2008, just over 5,000 credible-fear referrals were made. In 2016, it was almost 92,000.\par \par \uc2 Why? Largely because multiple U.S. laws have glaring loopholes that encourage the illegal immigration of children and families and the use of asylum claims as the preferred method to enter the U.S.\par \par \uc2 When \u8220\'20\'1Cunaccompanied alien children\u8221\'20\'1D (UACs) from countries other than Mexico or Canada cross the border illegally, the well-intentioned Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 demands not that we quickly return them to family in their home country, but that we essentially treat them as victims of human trafficking. This is true even if a parent illegally in the U.S. paid for them to be smuggled .\par \par \uc2 The result is that they are connected with family in the U.S. or placed in foster care while they await an immigration court hearing that could be years away. Of course many of these children never show up for their hearing. As a result, less than 5 percent of UACs are removed from the U.S.\par \par \uc2 Similarly, when an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  family crosses the border, the \uc2 U.S. government\uc2  is not allowed to detain the child. The 1997 Flores Settlement mandates that unaccompanied children can\u8217\'20\'19t be detained for more than 20 days. But in 2016, the 9th Circuit Court decided that this applied to all children, even those accompanied by parents.\par \par \uc2 When the parents claim asylum, as many now do, it takes more than 20 days to adjudicate their cases. So the \uc2 U.S. government\uc2  has a choice: Do they release the child but detain the parents who have broken the law by illegally entering the U.S. and not had their asylum claims adjudicated? Or release the entire family?\par \par \uc2 The U.S. would prefer to keep families together in custody awaiting the outcome of their cases, but it is simply not allowed to.\par \par \uc2 But wait, some say \u8211\'20\'13 asylum-seeking isn\u8217\'20\'19t illegal. There is a legal way to do it (at a port of entry) and an illegal way (sneak into the U.S. and then, after being arrested, claim asylum). With the right words and a little coaching, many asylum-seekers pass the credible-fear screening, but fewer than 10 percent of Hondurans, Salvadorans, and Guatemalans end up qualifying for asylum.\par \par \uc2 Society-wide violence, jobs or reuniting with family are not grounds for asylum. Knowing this, many never show up for court. They simply live illegally in the U.S. once released.\par \par \uc2 To discourage illegal immigration, the U.S. must change these incentives. Congress should make it much harder for those crossing the border illegally to claim asylum.\par \par \uc2 Lawmakers should first adjust the asylum-claim process. One way is to first require asylum-seekers traveling to the U.S. southern border to have their asylum claims heard at a U.S. consulate in Mexico.\par \par \uc2 Interviewers should also ask the asylum-seekers why they did not assert asylum in other countries, such as Mexico. If they fail to explain why, immigration officials should consider this a factor in their decisions.\par \par \uc2 Second, Congress must close the loopholes. That means rejecting the Flores settlement and instead allowing accompanied children to remain with their parents while they await adjudication of their asylum claims or prosecution for having violated immigration law.\par \par \uc2 Congress should also reform the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act to allow unaccompanied children from countries that are noncontiguous with the U.S. to be quickly repatriated to their home countries.\par \par \uc2 Yes, other enforcement reforms are needed. But the above fixes would go a long way toward securing the border and deterring illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 CREDIT: By \uc2 David Inserra\uc2 The Heritage Foundation\par \par \uc2 Document TUCS000020181130eebu00037\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 Opinion\par {\*\bkmkstart toc10}{\*\bkmkend toc10}\b \uc2 It\u8217\'20\'19s time for US to end birthright citizenship\b0\par\par\uc2 Tribune Content Agency \par \uc2 689 \uc2 words\par \uc2 7 November 2018\par \uc2 The Arizona Daily Star\par \uc2 TUCS\par A16\par \uc2 ISSN:0888546X\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2018 The Arizona Daily Star.

When older, that child can then bring in relatives who can also receive all sorts of benefits, including free education and health care.\par \par \uc2 Who wouldn\u8217\'20\'19t want a deal like that? It\u8217\'20\'19s almost as good as the benefits Congress votes itself.\par \par \uc2 American citizenship should not be like a Cracker Jack prize. Read the Senate debate over what became the 14th Amendment to the Constitution and learn about the intentions of its architects, which was to guarantee equal rights for recently freed slaves and their children. It was also a rebuke to the Dred Scott decision, which declared that African-Americans were not and could not be citizens of the United States and to Article 1, Section 2 of the U.S. Constitution of 1787, which said that for purposes of representation in Congress, enslaved blacks in a state would be counted \u8220\'20\'1Cas three fifths of all other Persons.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 This is why \u8220\'20\'1Coriginal intent\u8221\'20\'1D is important. The words concerning the 14th Amendment \u8212\'20\'14 one from a Republican, the other from a Democrat \u8212\'20\'14 are instructive in understanding its purpose and meaning.\par \par \uc2 Sen. Jacob Howard (R-Mich.), who wrote the citizenship clause, said of the amendment: \u8220\'20\'1CThis will not, of course, include persons born in the United States who are foreigners, aliens, [or] who belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Sen. Lyman Trumbull (D-Ill.), who chaired the Judiciary Committee, concurred, saying of the clause \u8220\'20\'1Csubject to the jurisdiction thereof\u8221\'20\'1D that it meant \u8220\'20\'1Cnot owing allegiance to anybody else and being subject to the complete jurisdiction of the United States.\u8221\'20\'1D This was understood to also include Native Americans who were then subject to the jurisdiction of their own tribal laws.\par \par \uc2 Sen. Howard responded: \u8220\'20\'1CI concur entirely with the honorable senator from Illinois in holding that the word \u8216\'20\'18jurisdiction,\u8217\'20\'19 as here employed, ought to be construed so as to imply a full and complete jurisdiction on the part of the United States \u8230\'20\'26 that is to say, the same jurisdiction in extent and quality as applies to every citizen of the United States now.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 If you prefer a more recent opinion, here is Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.) in 1983: \u8220\'20\'1CIf making it easy to be an illegal alien isn\u8217\'20\'19t enough, how about offering a reward for being an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 ? No sane country would do that, right? Guess again. If you break our laws by entering this country without permission and give birth to a child, we reward that child with U.S. citizenship and guarantee a full access to all public and social services this society provides. And that\u8217\'20\'19s a lot of services. Is it any wonder that two-thirds of the babies born at taxpayer expense at country-run hospitals in Los Angeles are born to illegal alien mothers?\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 I concur with Trumbull, Howard and Reid and so should the rest of us, if we are to keep America\u8217\'20\'19s culture from being overwhelmed and destroyed.\par \par \uc2 CREDIT: Tribune Content Agency\par \par \uc2 Document TUCS000020181107eeb70000g\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 Opinion\par {\*\bkmkstart toc11}{\*\bkmkend toc11}\b \uc2 Letters to the Editor\b0\par\par\uc2 921 \uc2 words\par \uc2 3 October 2018\par \uc2 The Arizona Daily Star\par \uc2 TUCS\par A07\par \uc2 ISSN:0888546X\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2018 The Arizona Daily Star.

Gov. Ducey has made an unsustainable proposal that would provide teachers with the potential of a 20 percent raise over three years. Arizona might be able to pay for a 10 percent raise through budget gimmicks, one-time sweeps and shifting resources away from other areas, but we cannot count on funding increases without a sustainable revenue source.\par \par \uc2 There is $1.1 billion less in funding than in 2008. We are 47th in per-student funding. We have the second-largest class sizes in the nation. We are close to last in teacher pay. Educators across the state united and demanded that our students deserve more. They are not walking out ON kids, they are walking out FOR kids.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 PHOENIX -- The question of how much it will cost "dreamers" to get a higher education in Arizona could turn on who the state Supreme Court decides is in this country with "lawful immigration status."\par \par \uc2 In new legal filings, the attorney for the Maricopa community colleges told the justices that phrase is the same as "lawful presence." Mary O'Grady said those in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program fit that definition because the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2  has -- at least for the moment -- allowed them to not only remain without fear of deportation but also to work.\par \par \uc2 But Attorney General \uc2 Mark Brnovich\uc2 , in new legal briefs, contends that acceptance into the DACA program does not translate into being in this country legally.\par \par \uc2 All that is important because Proposition 300, approved by voters in 2006, specifically says that anyone who is not a citizen or legal resident or who is "without lawful immigration status is not entitled to classification as an in-state student."\par \par \uc2 Brnovich contends -- and the Court of Appeals agreed -- that does not entitle dreamers to pay the lower tuition being charged by the Maricopa colleges, some other community colleges and the state university system. The Supreme Court has agreed to hear arguments early next month and reach its own conclusion.\par \par \uc2 In some ways the fight is less about the law and more about who gets to define what some words mean.\par \par \uc2 O'Grady points out that Prop. 300 doesn't define "lawful immigration status."\par \par \uc2 Instead, she said, it makes a reference to the 1996 federal \uc2 Illegal Immigrant\uc2  Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act. And that law talks about those who are not "lawfully present" in this country.\par \par \uc2 She also noted that another provision of Prop. 300 requires colleges and universities to report students who are denied financial assistance because they were "not lawfully present."\par \par \uc2 What makes that significant, O'Grady argues, is DACA.\par \par \uc2 That program, approved by the Obama administration in 2012, specifically allows those in the program to not only remain without fear of deportation but also to be issued Employment Authorization Documents (EADs) entitling them to work here.\par \par \uc2 "Because DACA recipients' stays in the United States are authorized by the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2  while they are in the DACA program, they are lawfully present under this statutory definition," O'Grady wrote. And that, in turn, allows them to attend community colleges and universities paying only in-state tuition if they meet other residency requirements.\par \par \uc2 Brnovich, for his part, urged the justices to reject what he sees as a stretch in verbiage.\par \par \uc2 He told the justices that the key elements of the 2006 law limit in-state tuition to only those with "lawful immigration status." And Brnovich said they should not accept O'Grady's bid to conflate that phrase "lawful presence."\par \par \uc2 "If Prop. 300 is to be rewritten in the name of absurdity, the substantive provisions should control the reporting provisions -- not the other way around," he said.\par \par \uc2 What the justices decide ultimately will affect more than the Maricopa colleges, which were sued in 2013 by Tom Horne, Brnovich's predecessor, after the board concluded that DACA recipients, by virtue of the EADs they possess, are entitled to the presumption of being here legally.\par \par \uc2 Two years later, Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Arthur Anderson sided with the colleges. That, in turn, spurred the \uc2 Arizona Board of Regents\uc2  to establish a similar policy.\par \par \uc2 At last count, about 300 dreamers are attending one of the state's three universities while paying in-state tuition.\par \par \uc2 The difference in costs is significant.\par \par \uc2 At the \uc2 University of Arizona\uc2 , for example, current tuition and mandatory fees for new students this year is $12,228 for those who qualify as residents. The figure for new out-of-state students is $35,658.\par \par \uc2 Pima Community College\uc2  also now offers in-state tuition to DACA recipients.\par \par \uc2 Credit: Howard Fischer Capitol Media Services\par \par \uc2 Document TUCS000020180307ee370008m\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 News\par {\*\bkmkstart toc19}{\*\bkmkend toc19}\b \uc2 Letters to the editor\b0\par\par\uc2 975 \uc2 words\par \uc2 12 September 2017\par \uc2 The Arizona Daily Star\par \uc2 TUCS\par \uc2 ISSN:0888546X\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2017 The Arizona Daily Star.

It is a known tactic used by the adult \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  population to bring their children into the country, believing that they become safer from deportation.

He is a former Republican state lawmaker who lost his seat in 2008 when he was challenged by Prescott rancher and businessman \uc2 Steve Pierce\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Two years ago, O'Halleran attempted to get his Senate seat back by running as an independent. He now identifies as a Democrat, and easily defeated his Democratic rival in the August primary.\par \par \uc2 The Cook Political Report, a nonpartisan online newsletter that analyzes elections and campaigns says the race is too close to call, labeling it a "Democratic toss-up."\par \par \uc2 THE DISTRICT'S\par \par \uc2 BIG ISSUES\par \par \uc2 Shortly after learning he had won the Republican primary last month, Babeu shifted his focus to what he called the single largest issue in the district -- coal.\par \par \uc2 Less understood in the southernmost part of the vast district, Babeu said the \uc2 Environmental Protection Agency\uc2  has overstepped its mandate by announcing mandatory cuts in the use of coal for power generation.\par \par \uc2 Such proposals could close the coal-powered Navajo generating station, putting thousands out of work, constricting regional energy supplies and likely fueling increases in energy rates.\par \par \uc2 Speaking out against the \uc2 EPA\uc2  has solidified a Republican base wary of federal mandates and has served as an attack against O'Halleran, who once served as a consultant to environmental groups.\par \par \uc2 "There are 3,000 jobs directly connected to the four coal-fired generating stations in Arizona," Babeu said. "They are all in District 1."\par \par \uc2 O'Halleran also opposes the \uc2 EPA\uc2 's mandates, saying they were made without being part of a national energy policy and without concern to how they would affect rural communities.\par \par \uc2 "This is not that competitiveness is taking us out, this is government coming in ... without any concern about you, the school district, the fire district or the community around these power plants," he said. "Some of our best jobs in the district are either at the power plants or at the mines on the Navajo Reservation."\par \par \uc2 Both men believe in climate change, with O'Halleran saying he pressured the \uc2 Bureau of Reclamation\uc2  to include climate change in its modeling system for the Colorado River more than a decade ago.\par \par \uc2 Babeu says he wants to see the coal industry adopt new technology to cut pollution. However, he believes it would take more than a decade to bring new energy sources like natural gas to rural Arizona.\par \par \uc2 O'Halleran notes that even \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  has an energy plan using coal.\par \par \uc2 "Everybody has talked about it," he said.\par \par \uc2 BABEU: TIME TO ACT\par \par \uc2 ON IMMIGRATION\par \par \uc2 On the campaign trail, Babeu still gets questions about getting comprehensive immigration reform through Congress. He remains optimistic that Congress will tackle the issue next year.\par \par \uc2 "So many people have asked me that same question, 'Is this ever going to get resolved?'" said Babeu. "The most important issues in this country seem to percolate to the point that is becomes a crisis for us to finally act. I think we are there now."\par \par \uc2 The biggest issue, for him, continues to be securing the border against possible terrorists sneaking into the country.\par \par \uc2 "Securing the border has a new meaning now, and not just because of illegal immigration or drug cartels that we've really focused on," he said. "With the advent of ISIS and terrorists, it stands to reason that if this volume of people are crossing undetected with military training and all of the financial resources at their disposal, that they can get in just as easy, if not easier."\par \par \uc2 He stopped short of saying how often he believed such people were crossing into Arizona from Mexico.\par \par \uc2 "I am not saying that there is a mad rush of these individuals. What I am saying is that it should raise eyebrows," Babeu said. "All of us should want a sovereign, secure border because of that."\par \par \uc2 Babeu has had his share of political scandals, including allegations that abusive disciplinary practices were used on students at a private school he once ran in Massachusetts and media reports that the fierce opponent of illegal immigration had a romantic relationship with an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Babeu has dismissed the attacks as thinly veiled political hit pieces, going so far as to file a bar complaint against Democratic Massachusetts Rep. Katherine Clark for her allegations that Babeu attempted to thwart an investigation into the school.\par \par \uc2 Babeu ran the school 15 years ago.\par \par \uc2 The primary was also hard on Babeu, as two of his sisters endorsed one of his Republican rivals, Wendy Rogers.\par \par \uc2 "Paul thinks only of himself and his political career at the expense of others. He does not care about the people whom elected officials are called to serve," sister Veronica Babeu Keating said in a prepared statement.\par \par \uc2 O'HALLERAN: I HAVEN'T CHANGED; THE GOP HAS\par \par \uc2 O'Halleran's break from the Republican party happened years ago.\par \par \uc2 "My values haven't changed.

"What has changed is the party I was with."\par \par \uc2 His core issue is how GOP leadership slashed education funding in 2009 when facing a state budget crisis.\par \par \uc2 O'Halleran said he was devastated that the Legislature was willing to sacrifice K-12 education as well as money to community colleges and the state universities rather than making cuts elsewhere.\par \par \uc2 "It is short-sighted and not the direction our country should be going in," O'Halleran said.\par \par \uc2 Additionally, the Legislature dismantled reforms he helped to enact regarding Child Protective Services by gutting funding.\par \par \uc2 "Tearing apart families is not leadership," he said.\par \par \uc2 He said he ran for Congress once learning that his friend Ann Kirkpatrick, with whom he served in the Legislature, was running for another office.\par \par \uc2 "I ran because I feel that Congress has let people down," he said.\par \par \uc2 Topping his political priorities is a jobs plan that focuses on education, job training and improvements in infrastructure -- particularly broadband internet service -- in rural parts of the state.\par \par \uc2 He believes high-speed Internet access is essential for education and small businesses to survive and to allow rural Arizonans to compete in the 21st century.\par \par \uc2 Credit: Joe Ferguson Arizona Daily Star\par \par \uc2 Document TUCS000020161026ec9p006k4\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\bkmkstart toc23}{\*\bkmkend toc23}\b \uc2 Letters to the editor\b0\par\par\uc2 995 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 March 2016\par \uc2 The Arizona Daily Star\par \uc2 TUCS\par \uc2 ISSN:0888546X\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2016 The Arizona Daily Star.

More to the point, SB 1044 would forbid counting anyone who is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Kavanagh's move come as several Arizona cities are conducting mid-decade counts to get a more accurate figure of how many people are present. That can have immediate financial consequences as some state dollars are doled out to communities based on population.\par \par \uc2 There's a lot of money involved.\par \par \uc2 This past budget year the state distributed nearly $609 million in "urban revenue sharing." State transportation dollars also are allocated to communities at least in part based on population.\par \par \uc2 In general, the larger the community, the bigger the slice.\par \par \uc2 How many people are here illegally remains a guess at best.\par \par \uc2 Pew Hispanic estimated there are 11.3 million undocumented individuals in the country.

So the new revenue sharing figures after 2020 would be reset based on total population.\par \par \uc2 Then there's the simple question of why anyone would admit to someone who shows up at the door there are people present who are not here legally.

The GOP- drafted bill (HR 3009) is a response to a recent murder in San Francisco, a sanctuary city, in which an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  with felony convictions allegedly gunned down Kathryn Steinle after city authorities released him from custody. Officials in sanctuary cities say that to assist with federal immigration enforcement would undercut community-policing efforts that depend on rapport with immigrant populations. Backers of the bill said cities are required by law to comply with federal requests that they detain illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 A yes vote was to send the bill to the Senate.\par \par \uc2 Yes: Martha McSally, R-2, Paul Gosar, R-4, Matt Salmon, R-5, David Schweikert, R-6, Trent Franks, R-8, Kyrsten Sinema, D-9\par \par \uc2 No: Ann Kirkpatrick, D-1, Raul Grijalva, D-3, Ruben Gallego, D-7\par \par \uc2 SANCTUARY CITY CRIME RATES\par \par \uc2 Voting 181 for and 239 against, the House on July 23 defeated a bid by Democrats to block any funding cuts under HR 3009 (above) that would reduce a city's deployment of police on the beat or raise its crime rate with respect to domestic violence, sex crimes or crimes against children.\par \par \uc2 A yes vote was to adopt the motion, which, had it prevailed, would have immediately amended the bill.\par \par \uc2 Yes: Kirkpatrick, Grijalva, Gallego, Sinema\par \par \uc2 No: McSally, Gosar, Salmon, Schweikert, Franks\par \par \uc2 STATE REGULATION OF COAL ASH\par \par \uc2 Voting 258 for and 166 against, the House on July 22 passed a GOP- drafted bill (HR 1734) that would give states rather than the \uc2 Environmental Protection Agency\uc2  primary authority to regulate the coal ash discharged as waste by the nation's 500-plus coal-fired power plants. The bill would put states in charge of permitting and enforcement under a new \uc2 EPA\uc2  rule for regulating coal ash impounded in ponds or landfills near these plants. The federal rule takes effect Oct. 19. Addressing factors such as the structural integrity and location of storage sites, it is designed to protect drinking water, groundwater and air quality from ash containing elements such as arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead and selenium.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 EPA\uc2  began its rulemaking process in response to a December 2008 spill at a \uc2 Tennessee Valley Authority\uc2  facility at Kingston, Tenn., which spread coal-ash sludge over 300 acres and into the Emory and Clinch rivers.\par \par \uc2 A yes vote was to send the bill to the Senate.\par \par \uc2 Yes: Kirkpatrick, McSally, Gosar, Salmon, Schweikert\par \par \uc2 No: Grijalva, Gallego, Sinema\par \par \uc2 Not voting: Franks\par \par \uc2 DRINKING WATER\par \par \uc2 FROM NEARBY WELLS\par \par \uc2 Voting 192 for and 231 against, the House on July 22 refused to require operators of coal-ash impoundment sites to provide notification and alternative sources of safe drinking water to properties within one-half mile whose wells show signs of coal-ash contamination. The Democratic-sponsored amendment was offered to HR 1734 (above).\par \par \uc2 A yes vote was to adopt the amendment.\par \par \uc2 Yes: Kirkpatrick, Grijalva, Gallego\par \par \uc2 No: McSally, Gosar, Salmon, Schweikert, Sinema\par \par \uc2 Not voting: Franks\par \par \uc2 VOLUNTARY GMO LABELING\par \par \uc2 Voting 275 for and 150 against, the House on July 23 passed a bill (HR 1599) that would establish a system of voluntary, state- administered labeling requirements for foods that contain genetically modified organisms (GMOs). In addition, the bill pre- empts any existing or future state or local laws that establish mandatory labeling of genetically engineered foods. At present, there are no federal requirements for GMO labeling.\par \par \uc2 A yes vote favored a voluntary state-by-state approach to labeling GMO foods.\par \par \uc2 Yes: Kirkpatrick, McSally, Gosar, Salmon, Schweikert, Sinema\par \par \uc2 Voting no: Grijalva, Gallego, Franks\par \par \uc2 MANDATORY GMO LABELING\par \par \uc2 Voting 123 for and 303 against, the House on July 23 defeated an amendment to HR 1599 (above) that sought to require mandatory, federally administered labeling of foods containing genetically modified organisms. This would replace the underlying bill's voluntary state-level approach.\par \par \uc2 A yes vote was to establish federally mandated labeling of foods containing GMOs.\par \par \uc2 Yes: Grijalva, Gallego\par \par \uc2 No: Kirkpatrick, McSally, Gosar, Salmon, Schweikert, Franks, Sinema\par \par \uc2 'NATURAL' GMO FOODS\par \par \uc2 Voting 163 for and 262 against, the House on July 23 refused to prohibit food labeled as "natural" from containing generically modified ingredients.

Because the Highway Trust Fund is projected to raise only $240 billion over the next six years to finance these projects, the bill faces a shortfall of $77 billion that would be funded by revenue increases or spending cuts yet to be fully determined.

Right-angle crashes are simply much more dangerous than rear-end collisions."\par \par \uc2 The study says this increase is not surprising. "When a new signal is installed on a roadway, the same pattern is seen -- the more severe angle crashes are decreased while the less severe rear- end crashes usually increase to some extent."

Instead, at the border and after a criminal conviction, "deportations are just automatic," Long said.\par \par \uc2 On Nov. 20, the administration announced an effort to keep families together by deferring deportation for some parents of children who are U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents, focusing the government's resources on deporting certain people, including convicted felons and recent border crossers.\par \par \uc2 But Long said it's contradictory to say the administration wants to "deport felons, not families" when it continues to prioritize deportation of anyone caught at the border.\par \par \uc2 Parents of U.S. citizen children are nearly twice as likely to be processed under a previous deportation order and 1.35 times more likely to be charged with illegal entry or illegal re-entry than nonparents, \uc2 Human Rights Watch\uc2  said in the report, which is based on Customs and Border Protection apprehension data from fiscal years 2011 and 2012.\par \par \uc2 "When someone is separated from their family and they don't see any way out, they continue to cross and continue to cross," Long said. "Someone can be a felon simply by trying to rejoin their family multiple times."\par \par \uc2 ALMOST A FELON\par \par \uc2 Aurora Olivares almost became a felon herself. She now sits in a Nogales, Sonora, women's shelter trying to decide what to do.\par \par \uc2 The Puebla native, who lived in Utah for 11 years, is the mother of three girls, ages 8 through 12, who are all U.S. citizens.\par \par \uc2 "I was happy. I was working and I had my three girls," she said. But she hadn't seen her parents in 11 years and she feared her mother, who was very ill, would die before they were able to see each other again. So she returned to Mexico and brought her daughters with her.\par \par \uc2 They spent a few months in Puebla and, on April 18, 2012, she put them on a direct flight to Utah from Mexico City, while she took another plane to Hermosillo. In Sonora, she thought, she would cross illegally as she had done 12 years ago.\par \par \uc2 While her daughters arrived safely in Utah, Olivares was caught by the Border Patrol at the border and deported back to Mexico.\par \par \uc2 She tried crossing again in 2013 but was detained, and this time she was charged criminally with illegal re-entry, a felony, plus a misdemeanor of illegal entry. She was processed in Tucson through Operation Streamline -- a federal program in which immigrants enter pleas en masse -- and accepted a deal to plead guilty to the misdemeanor charge.\par \par \uc2 She received a 75-day sentence, but was in a detention center for more than a year as she sought asylum and went through appeals. Before a final decision on her case came down, she was deported through Nogales on Dec. 30, 2014.\par \par \uc2 "I didn't care about being detained as long as it meant one last shot at being with my daughters again," she said, tears streaming down her cheeks.\par \par \uc2 "A LINE HAS TO BE DRAWN"\par \par \uc2 She hasn't seen her daughters in nearly three years. While they could travel to Mexico, her former partner won't let them do so and is limiting communication between them.\par \par \uc2 What \uc2 Human Rights Watch\uc2  wants the government to do is an overreach, said \uc2 Jessica Vaughan\uc2 , director of policy studies for the D.C.-based \uc2 Center for Immigration Studies\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "It's their choice to keep trying to come back here, exposing themselves to potentially being prosecuted," she said. "It's important to recognize there is some responsibility for repeatedly ignoring the law rather than waiting it out for an opportunity to come back legally in the future if the son or daughter sponsors them."\par \par \uc2 Having family members here, she said, should not trump a criminal history or another factor that makes someone ineligibile.\par \par \uc2 "If we are going to have regulated legal immigration, a line has to be drawn somewhere, and the government has to be ready to enforce it," Vaughan said.\par \par \uc2 There are already more qualified potential legal immigrants waiting in line than the country can accommodate every year, she said.\par \par \uc2 Olivares said she just wants an opportunity to come back.\par \par \uc2 "There are many mothers like me, who are crying, who are pleading for an opportunity," she said.\par \par \uc2 She would stay in Mexico if she didn't have children or she could bring them with her, she said, but that's not an option.\par \par \uc2 She misses their hugs, their kisses. Waking them up in the morning, taking them to the park and helping them with their homework.\par \par \uc2 It breaks her heart, she said, when they do get to talk and they ask when she's coming back.\par \par \uc2 The little one tells her, "Mommy, I'm afraid I'm not going to remember your face anymore." Olivares just tells her she'll send her photographs to make sure that doesn't happen.\par \par \uc2 A PERILOUS JOURNEY\par \par \uc2 She walked through the desert by herself, guided by a smuggler using a cellphone. She wandered lost, with only the sounds of the coyotes and snakes in the background. She has jumped the iron border fence more than once.\par \par \uc2 All with one goal: being back with her daughters. But now she weighs all her options. She knows if she tries to cross back and gets caught, the punishment will be more severe. She already has a 20-year bar from returning to the United States.\par \par \uc2 All of her legal troubles relate to trying to cross the border, but some immigrants lose their legal status and get deported after criminal convictions like for certain drug offenses.\par \par \uc2 "We live in a world in which we've had harsh criminal immigration laws since 1996 that continue to punish immigration harshly for what are some times old or minor crimes that many people in this country are discussing to reduce punishments for," Long said.\par \par \uc2 The 1996 \uc2 Illegal Immigrant\uc2  Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act expanded the definition of "aggravated felonies" to include nonviolent theft offenses, nonviolent drug offenses, forgery and fraud, for example.\par \par \uc2 What's really needed is a permanent solution, Long said, "to take a look at those laws and the kinds of stories we highlight that show who can be swept up in the system," Long said. "People who are veterans, people who paid their dues in prison and now are left with really severe consequences that tear them apart from their families."\par \par \uc2 Some key findings:\par \par \uc2 Based on data of 700,000 Customs and Border Protection apprehensions at the border, out of which 15 percent were of parents of U.S. citizen children:\par \par \uc2 60 percent of parents with U.S. citizens who were caught at the border by Customs and Border Protection were processed under expedited removal or reinstatement of removal, meaning they had a prior deportation order.Few, the report found, were processed in a way that would let them explain their case to an immigration judge.They were nearly twice as likely (1.77 times) to be processed under a previous deportation order or reinstatement of removal.And 1.35 times more likely than non-parents of U.S. citizens to be charged with an illegal entry or re-entry crime.In fiscal years 2011 and 2012, only .2 percent of parents of U.S. citizens were charged as deportable by CBP because they were convicted of an aggravated felony.In 2012, 24 percent of "criminal aliens" deported had immigration crimes like illegal entry and re-entry as their most serious conviction.\par \par \uc2 Source: \uc2 Human Rights Watch\par \par \uc2 Document TUCS000020150109eb190002x\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 Opinion\par {\*\bkmkstart toc34}{\*\bkmkend toc34}\b \uc2 Facebook\uc2  comments from our readers\b0\par\par\uc2 347 \uc2 words\par \uc2 24 October 2014\par \uc2 The Arizona Daily Star\par \uc2 TUCS\par A11\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 The Arizona Daily Star.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 On Friday it will be two years since a Border Patrol agent in Nogales emptied his pistol across the border, firing through a high fence of metal poles, down a steep hill and across a Mexican street, killing 15-year-old Jose Antonio Elena Rodriguez.\par \par \uc2 The federal investigation into the killing began immediately, but today it remains, in the customary term of the \uc2 FBI\uc2 , "ongoing."\par \par \uc2 When I interviewed Jose Antonio's mother, Araceli Rodriguez, in December 2012, she complained about the slow pace of the American investigation. She hadn't seen anything yet. What she didn't know is that such prolonged probes are typical of federal investigations into shootings by Border Patrol agents.\par \par \uc2 Still, even I naively thought this investigation would come to a faster resolution. There are eyewitnesses to the shooting, one of whom told my colleague Perla Trevizo last year that Jose Antonio was walking along the sidewalk when shot, not throwing rocks as the Border Patrol originally alleged. There's also video from a mounted camera along the border. And there's a growing sense of public concern about this and other cases.\par \par \uc2 That hasn't made a difference. Federal prosecutors would not explain the delay, but defense attorney Sean Chapman, who represents the agent who shot Jose Antonio, told me prosecutors are waiting for Mexican officials to hand over evidence related to the autopsy.\par \par \uc2 The lack of a decision doesn't mean there hasn't been action. Elena's killing and more recent cases of alleged misconduct by Border Patrol agents have shown that going around the feds is the only way to ensure justice is done in a timely manner. In cases of possible misconduct by federal agents, local law enforcement and civil attorneys are the ones who can force the wheels of justice to turn for victims.\par \par \uc2 As for the accused agents, they're pretty much forced to wait, in limbo, for the feds to make up their minds.\par \par \uc2 "My clients would rather that they didn't take a long time, because they have it hanging over their heads forever," said Chapman, himself a former federal prosecutor.\par \par \uc2 Perhaps the clearest recent example of federal reticence came to light last month. The Santa Cruz County Attorney's Office filed a felony assault charge against a Nogales Border Patrol agent, Aldo Arteaga, who slugged a teenage detainee in the stomach.\par \par \uc2 The Jan. 30 incident was clearly visible on a video camera mounted in the detention cell. The video shows Arteaga, with no visible provocation, punching the teen once in the stomach, and the teen staggering back onto the floor. The blow isn't exceptionally vicious -- what jumps out from the video is the casual nature of the punch. It makes you wonder how many times this happens and nobody finds out.\par \par \uc2 Federal prosecutors watched the video Feb. 12 and decided a month later that the punch "did not appear egregious enough to warrant prosecution," The Associated Press reported Friday.\par \par \uc2 The agency didn't act to discipline Arteaga either. But in late September the agency's Office of Professional Responsibility asked the Santa Cruz County Attorney to review the case. It was the local prosecutors who quickly made the simple decision that it was an assault, though they were forced to refile the charge as a misdemeanor because the victim was not younger than 15, as they had thought.\par \par \uc2 In yet another case this year, friction arose between Pima County sheriff's deputies and Border Patrol agents after the May 30 killing in Green Valley by Border Patrol agent Daniel Marquez of smuggling suspect Jose Arambula. Marquez had been chasing Arambula on foot, when, Marquez said, Arambula turned and made punching out motions with his hands, as if he was firing a gun. But he was unarmed when Marquez opened fire.\par \par \uc2 At the scene, agents grew angry, according to Pima County Sheriff's Department reports, because they felt the investigators were treating them like criminals. As my colleague Carmen Duarte reported, one deputy's report offered this eyebrow-raising description of the federal agents' reaction. "Some of the comments I heard included: 'We are all cops; why are you treating us like this? This is ridiculous, and there is no need for this.' "\par \par \uc2 Chapman, the Tucson attorney who represents Agent Marquez, told me the friction also arose because investigators did not allow Marquez to speak with Chapman for 2ae hours.\par \par \uc2 Eventually, the Pima County Attorney's Office declined to press charges, deciding that the shooting was justified, but the unsympathetic posture of the sheriff's investigators on the scene encourages me, because it gives at least the impression of an unbiased investigation. In the end, it also gives more confidence in the prosecutor's decision not to file charges. And the quicker decision removes the agent from limbo.\par \par \uc2 No local law enforcement has been willing to take up the investigation of Jose Antonio's killing, in part because of the jurisdictional difficulties caused by the cross-border shooting. But his family ran out of patience, got legal help and filed suit July 29. The \uc2 American Civil Liberties Union\uc2  joined the family's Nogales attorney, Luis Parra, in filing the wrongful-death suit, giving it a little extra oomph.\par \par \uc2 I know from speaking with Parra in 2012 that he had planned to file suit only after hearing first whether the government decided to pursue charges.\par \par \uc2 In retrospect, it's no surprise that they haven't yet decided. There seems to be a reticence permeating the federal government to hold agents accountable for shootings. The Border Patrol's acting internal-affairs chief acknowledged that the agency has not internally disciplined any of the agents responsible for 46 killings that have occurred since 2004, the Arizona Republic reported Sept. 14.\par \par \uc2 Perhaps the agency's internal disciplinarians have been deferring to federal prosecutors' decisions. But then, who are the \uc2 FBI\uc2  and federal prosecutors deferring to? Don't forget: They're not deciding whether the agent's guilty -- they're deciding whether a jury should decide guilt.\par \par \uc2 Until federal investigators show some sense of urgency in resolving these cases, expect more civil suits and local-police investigations of Border Patrol agents' actions. These are the only ways the public can know for sure that agents are being held accountable.\par \par \uc2 Online:\par \par \uc2 View the video of an agent punching an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  at Tucson.com/video\par \par \uc2 Document TUCS000020141005eaa500006\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 Metro\par {\*\bkmkstart toc36}{\*\bkmkend toc36}\b \uc2 Immigration activists convicted of disorderly conduct for protest\b0\par\par\uc2 Patrick McNamara   \par \uc2 Patrick McNamara Arizona Daily Star\par \uc2 448 \uc2 words\par \uc2 4 October 2014\par \uc2 The Arizona Daily Star\par \uc2 TUCS\par C07\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 The Arizona Daily Star.

The rail line was so popular with gawkers you'd think Woody Guthrie had been inspired to write "This train is bound for glory" by the round trip from the maintenance facility to the Mercado District west of I-10.\par \par \uc2 Look at their mugs, smiling at the sight of our modern streetcar the way Mister Rogers smiled at "Trolley" every time it returned from the Barrio of Make-Believe, humming, "it's a beautiful day in the neighborhoods" from midtown to downtown.\par \par \uc2 It's as if Tennessee Williams wrote "a streetcar named desire for a viable downtown" in steel and asphalt, and downtown, like a sweaty Brando shouting "Stella" at the top of his aching lungs, was shouting "I'm back" at Southern Arizona.\par \par \uc2 The streetcar is the ark by which the \uc2 University of Arizona\uc2  and its children are colonizing and invigorating downtown. By shuttling frisky Wildcats into downtown for wilding sprees with their parent's debit cards, the ancient urban planner's prophecy shall be fulfilled.\par \par \uc2 Verily, I say unto thee, thy streetcar shall run to and fro and verily, unto downtown, it shall beget students who shall beget student housing which shall beget fine dining which shall beget clubs which shall beget retail which shall beget who knows? Maybe even a Trader Joe's? And verily thy aging boomers shall buy lofts and sip Manhattans and downtown will be rocking as unto a shining city on a hill.\par \par \uc2 The economic benefits of the streetcar are clear: permanent jobs, thriving revenue-generating enterprises springing up along the line like seedlings next to a river, and a notable boost in the incomes of personal injury lawyers representing maladroit bicyclists.\par \par \uc2 I'm excited about the plans to expand the streetcar line. Take it up Campbell Avenue to Wisconsin, and out west to Southern California, link it up with the monorail at Disneyland, offering inebriated students a chance to sober up on Mr. Toad's Wild Ride long after the fireworks have ended.\par \par \uc2 It's the little electric engine that could, making it over countless hills thanks to the many obsessed and possessed Tucsonans clinging to their "I think we can, I think we can" attitude.\par \par \uc2 Here's to the founders of Old Pueblo Trolley, \uc2 Gene Caywood\uc2  and Dick Guthrie, a pair of trolley pushers who were promoting a streetcar for Tucson before Rice-A-Roni was the San Francisco treat. Clang, clang, clang, went the trolley. Hum, hum, hum came the streetcar.\par \par \uc2 Here's to the group of trolley huggers full of sense and sensibility called Tucsonans for Sensible Transportation who kick- started it all in 2001.\par \par \uc2 Here's to Steve Farley, public artist, state senator and light- rail evangelist, who preached the word of the electric shuttle to the heathens until he was hoarse, amen.\par \par \uc2 Nudged by a coalition of similar light rail-o-philes, homebuilders and auto dealers, the voters in 2006, approved a half- cent sales tax, funding the \uc2 Regional Transportation Authority\uc2  Plan. The RTA plan purchased buses, bikeways, blimps, gondolas, enough asphalt to pave the moon, the streetcar system and two wicker rickshaws pulled by javelinas.\par \par \uc2 Mayor Bob Walkup got the remaining funding for the blue ride from a federal economic stimulus grant by twisting arms in Washington, D.C., with such insistent cheer the \uc2 U.S. Department of Transportation\uc2  coughed up $63 million to make Bob go away and return their arms to their sockets.\par \par \uc2 I was told the streetcar required extensive testing in order to meet federal guidelines.\par \par \uc2 The ugly truth is, week after week, the streetcar kept failing the multiple-choice math portion of the exam. With the help of tutors, the streetcar finally passed, which brings us to yesterday's "Dia de los Mass Transit Mania," a day that was not marred by anti- immigration protesters attempting to block a northbound streetcar, demanding to search it for \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  children bound for "El Norte."\par \par \uc2 It was a day when partisan carping and empty-headed mewling was drowned out by the sweet rumbling hum of urban progress with a small carbon footprint -- a day when we celebrated bipartisan teamwork and persistent citizen engagement, a day when Tucson celebrated the inaugural run of its modern streetcar like a kid, wide-eyed and breathless, on Christmas morning celebrating his first Lionel train.\par \par \uc2 Document TUCS000020140726ea7q0002t\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 Metro\par {\*\bkmkstart toc40}{\*\bkmkend toc40}\b \uc2 US attorney says border shooting just ; Defense contends agent struck man on head with lasso\b0\par\par\uc2 Patrick McNamara   \par \uc2 Patrick McNamara Arizona Daily Star\par \uc2 644 \uc2 words\par \uc2 22 July 2014\par \uc2 The Arizona Daily Star\par \uc2 TUCS\par A02\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 The Arizona Daily Star.

She said Romo picked up a rock and motioned as if he intended to throw it at the agent, leaving the officer no choice but to fire on Romo.\par \par \uc2 Hamburger's statements came Monday in a civil trial in U.S. District Court in Tucson before Judge James A. Soto, in a case Romo filed against the federal government.\par \par \uc2 Romo seeks unspecified monetary damages from the government for the shooting, which greatly impaired his ability to walk because the bullet struck his spine.\par \par \uc2 In court documents, Romo's attorney, William Risner, accused the Border Patrol agent of shooting Romo as he attempted to flee back toward Mexico.\par \par \uc2 "Our confident position is that this was not justified," Risner said in his opening statements.\par \par \uc2 A complaint Risner filed in January 2012 says an unnamed Border Patrol agent on horseback intercepted Romo among a group of people attempting to enter the United States illegally, and that the agent, identified Monday as Abel Canales, repeatedly struck Romo over the head with a lasso after Romo had surrendered.\par \par \uc2 The documents say Romo then fled because he "could no longer take the pain from the lasso hitting his scalp ... ." The agent, according to the complaint, then shot Romo, who collapsed to the desert floor.\par \par \uc2 "The agent still on his horse, again chased Mr. Castro Romo down and bumped Mr. Castro Romo with the horse. Mr. Castro Romo fell to the ground on his stomach and face down. That is when Mr. Castro Romo felt a 'warm' feeling on his back after hearing a single gun shot," the complaint reads.\par \par \uc2 Hamburger said the agent shot Romo in the side and any scarring on Romo's back was the result of surgical procedures and not a gunshot.\par \par \uc2 Risner read portions of the agent's statements in his opening arguments where Canales said Romo twice picked up rocks with the intention of throwing them at him. But Canales also said he didn't see if Romo was holding a rock when the agent shot him.\par \par \uc2 Risner attempted to point out inconsistencies between the statements and a later court deposition where Canales said Romo appeared poised to throw the rock.\par \par \uc2 Hamburger said Canales was justified in shooting Romo because he had a legitimate fear for his safety.\par \par \uc2 "No doubt in his mind that, if he didn't react, either he or his horse would have been hit," Hamburger said.\par \par \uc2 She also noted Romo had been apprehended numerous times before and was concerned he could face prison time if convicted of repeated attempts at illegal re-entry.\par \par \uc2 A videotaped deposition of a witness to the incident took up much of the day Monday. Liliana Rodriguez Gonzalez sat for the deposition in December. Risner was allowed to play the video in lieu of Gonzalez's testimony because she can't be located. A warrant has been issued for her arrest. She also faces deportation proceedings.\par \par \uc2 In her deposition, Gonzalez was unable to recount many details of the shooting. She told interviewers she didn't see Canales hit Soto with a lasso or the reins from his horse, and wasn't sure if Romo was running away or lying on the ground when Canales shot him. The trial is scheduled to run through the week.\par \par \uc2 Document TUCS000020140722ea7m0000l\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 News\par {\*\bkmkstart toc41}{\*\bkmkend toc41}\b \uc2 6 in GOPgovernorrace stressthe border ; In debate, they saysecuring it is tiedto Ariz. economy\b0\par\par\uc2 Howard Fischer   \par \uc2 Howard Fischer Capitol Media Services\par \uc2 1,010 \uc2 words\par \uc2 22 July 2014\par \uc2 The Arizona Daily Star\par \uc2 TUCS\par A01\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 The Arizona Daily Star.

And some want to spend state tax dollars to do it.\par \par \uc2 Andrew Thomas\uc2  cited a \uc2 Center for Immigration Studies\uc2  report that said all new jobs created since 2000 "have been taken by immigrants, legal and illegal." The former Maricopa County Attorney said to fix high unemployment, "start with the obvious."\par \par \uc2 Former GoDaddy executive Christine Jones wants to spend money to send the National Guard to the border and construct additional miles of fence. She insists Arizona can simply send the bill for all that to \uc2 Congress\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 State Treasurer Doug Ducey said everything would be on the table. He said that includes "reprioritizing" the $300 million budget of the state Department of Public Safety and working with local sheriffs to focus on illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 Secretary of State \uc2 Ken Bennett\uc2  chided Jones, pointing out that Arizona has sent invoices to Washington before for things like paying the costs of incarcerating illegal immigrants who violate state laws.\par \par \uc2 "You're not going to pay for it with a magic wand," he said. "And you're not going to pay for it by sending the bill to \uc2 Congress\uc2  because they've already not paid several bills."\par \par \uc2 Former Mesa Mayor Scott Smith echoed the sentiment.\par \par \uc2 "I would love to say as governor I'm going to wave the magic wand and say here's what we're going to do," he said. "But then reality sets in, and the fact here is that nobody's talking reality."\par \par \uc2 And former California Congressman Frank Riggs said the governor does have some responsibility in helping secure the border.\par \par \uc2 "But that has to be a combined federal, state and local response," he said. "And to constantly blame illegal immigrants for every challenge that we have as a state is absolutely irresponsible."\par \par \uc2 Smith sought to keep the focus on the economy and job creation, referring to the study Thomas cited.\par \par \uc2 "That kind of begs the question: If every single one has been taken by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , ... we are in worse trouble from an economic standpoint than an immigration standpoint because we're not creating any high-quality jobs," he said. "I don't think the people who are crossing the border and walked across the desert are walking into that high-paying engineering job."\par \par \uc2 That brought a sharp response from Thomas, who corrected Scott, pointing out, "I said legal and illegal in case you weren't listening."\par \par \uc2 Ducey chided Smith and other foes of more spending to secure the border for their attitudes.\par \par \uc2 "Many of us, or some of us, here are very good at telling people what can't be done," he said. "I think a governor has to show what needs to be done and has to be the spokesperson for it."\par \par \uc2 He said claims the state can stop illegal immigration, or pay for such an effort, are false. "Which budget are you going to cut to transfer that?" he said.\par \par \uc2 Voters need to focus on the economy and not get sidetracked on various promises of what a new governor might be able to do about immigration, Smith said.\par \par \uc2 "We've only recovered half of the jobs we lost during the recession," he said. He added that Arizona is lagging far behind even California, also hard-hit during the downturn, but which has recovered all its lost jobs despite having what might be "the worst business tax and regulatory environment in the country."\par \par \uc2 But Smith said the problem in Arizona goes deeper.\par \par \uc2 "We're not only recovering jobs at a slower rate," he said. "But the quality of jobs we are recovering are basically minimum-wage jobs. They're not the high-quality jobs that we lost."\par \par \uc2 Ducey promised to sign a moratorium on new state regulations the first day he takes office, not withstanding the fact there already is one in place, put there by incumbent \uc2 Jan Brewer\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Riggs promised new incentives for business, including the ability to take an immediate tax write-off on the cost of new equipment in the year it was purchased. Now, larger purchases must be amortized as deductions over multiple years.\par \par \uc2 Riggs was undeterred by questions of lower state tax revenues, saying the change "will pay for itself, in stimulation and job creation."\par \par \uc2 While that helps manufacturers, Smith noted it leaves out service- oriented businesses that do not make large capital purchases.\par \par \uc2 Jones was a bit less specific, promising to "streamline" the state tax code.\par \par \uc2 And Thomas reiterated his contention that border security "dwarfs all other issues."\par \par \uc2 The question of how to get any of this done had each of the contenders claiming some unique experience.\par \par \uc2 Smith noted his time as both mayor of Mesa and head of the U.S. Conference of Mayors.\par \par \uc2 Ducey and Jones both cited their experience in the private sector, him as head of the Cold Stone Creamery ice cream chain and her as an executive of GoDaddy website hosting.\par \par \uc2 Bennett said he was state Senate president the last time Arizona had a balanced budget, while Thomas said he took on the powerful as a county attorney -- at least before he was disbarred.\par \par \uc2 And Riggs said his three terms in the U.S. House, albeit from California, give him instant credibility in working with \uc2 Congress\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 All of the candidates said the emergence of the tea party is good for the Republican Party, each insisting that he or she believes in many of the same things. But Thomas, who was disbarred for abusing his prosecutorial discretion, went farther.\par \par \uc2 "The liberal media attack the tea party for the same reason they attack any real conservative: They don't like the principles they stand for and they see that they're effective,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Online:\par \par \uc2 Find more election news at tucson.com/politics\par \par \uc2 Document TUCS000020140722ea7m00005\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 Metro\par {\*\bkmkstart toc42}{\*\bkmkend toc42}\b \uc2 Babeu provokes migrant protests for own benefit\b0\par\par\uc2 Tim Steller   \par \uc2 Tim Steller Arizona Daily Star\par \uc2 943 \uc2 words\par \uc2 16 July 2014\par \uc2 The Arizona Daily Star\par \uc2 TUCS\par A02\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 The Arizona Daily Star.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 You don't have to concern yourself with Pinal County Sheriff \uc2 Paul Babeu\uc2 's personal life to grasp that he has a love-hate relationship with illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Babeu, as you may know, has made a national name for himself over the last four years by taking a hard line against border insecurity and illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 What's less well-understood is that border crises are the lifeblood of Babeu's political career. Without them, his hopes for the next, bigger office wither.\par \par \uc2 To grasp that, ask yourself where he has been since 2012, when the revelation of his romance with an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  helped end his quest for a congressional seat. The border crisis diminished, and so did Babeu's political prominence.\par \par \uc2 This dynamic goes a long way toward explaining why two groups of protesters and a posse of reporters, deputies and "militia" members gathered in and near \uc2 Oracle\uc2  Tuesday morning. I joined them for a couple of hours.\par \par \uc2 During the current illegal-migrant wave, groups of Central Americans have been detained in Nogales, Tucson and other places in Arizona, but only when they were scheduled to arrive in Pinal County did a protest erupt. This is not a coincidence.\par \par \uc2 Babeu learned last week of the scheduled use of the Sycamore Canyon Academy south of \uc2 Oracle\uc2  in the Catalinas as a place to detain juvenile Central American migrants. He promptly informed the citizens of Pinal County, taking special pains to alert \uc2 Oracle\uc2  resident Robert Skiba.\par \par \uc2 Skiba was one of Babeu's early financial supporters in 2008, when the upstart Republican Babeu challenged Democratic hegemony in Pinal County offices and won. Told by Babeu when and where to expect buses carrying 40 or 50 Central American minors, Skiba took the initiative and got the protest rolling.\par \par \uc2 After he announced the protest, and even after protesters declared their plans to block the buses from going up Mount Lemmon Road to the academy, Babeu presented himself as the law-and-order man who would keep the peace. He handed protesters fliers on the Constitution Tuesday morning. He acted as if he was simply responding to the protests when he was actually their creator.\par \par \uc2 "Our job here today is to provide the First Amendment freedoms of speech, the right to assembly and to protest. I'm doing that for everybody who is here, as long as they're not violating the law," Babeu said Tuesday morning.\par \par \uc2 This sleight of hand is nothing new for Babeu. His political career is built on a double game: He uses border and immigration issues to arouse the passions of hard-right conservatives while at the same time building strong relationships with the GOP establishment. He gave primary-election endorsements to \uc2 John McCain\uc2  in 2010, \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2  in 2012 and Andy Tobin for \uc2 Congress\uc2  this year, all of whom were the establishment Republican favorites.\par \par \uc2 The double game can also be seen in his relationship with the self-appointed "militias" who occasionally show up at border- related events. Babeu's repeated denunciations of smuggling activity in the Vekol Valley of western Pinal County in 2010 prompted neo- Nazi J.T. Ready to begin independent patrols of the valley with a heavily armed group of fellow travelers.\par \par \uc2 Babeu's response was to issue a tepid statement discouraging Ready and Co. "I do not ask or encourage them to come here," it read, going on to say: "It will only complicate our concerns to have untrained and armed citizens, who are not from Pinal County, patrolling our desert areas."\par \par \uc2 What kind of person had Babeu inspired? Two years later, Ready massacred his ex-girlfriend and three family members in Gilbert before killing himself.\par \par \uc2 On Tuesday, members of the self-anointed Arizona Citizens Militia taped off a perhaps 75-foot stretch of the shoulder of Mount Lemmon Highway. Looking official in tan-and-black uniforms with dark sunglasses, and wearing communications radios in their ears, the men told me they were saving the space for a VIP to arrive later in the day. Pinal County deputies did not interfere with their seizure of public land or discourage them in any way.\par \par \uc2 These are the dangerous forces Babeu unleashes when he whips up anti-illegal-immigration fever. But necessity clearly demands that he do it. The new political action committee he has launched, \uc2 Paul Babeu\uc2  for Arizona, raised a relatively small $26,385 between Jan. 1 and May 31 this year, $15,000 of it from three individual donors who gave $5,000 apiece. He's also supporting a gubernatorial candidate, Christine Jones, who could well name Babeu the state's director of public safety if elected. They need this wave of anger.\par \par \uc2 Babeu adviser Sean McCaffrey, a one-time state GOP director who now works in Texas, explained a relevant principal in political fundraising in an online blog post earlier this year, and I think it helps explains the whole \uc2 Oracle\uc2  circus on Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 Over the years he'd discovered a universal rule of fundraising by mail, he wrote: "To get donors to give the most and the most often you either needed to really scare them, or really piss them off," McCaffrey wrote on the Beast Digital web site. "Fear and loathing of the unknowable or unthinkable remains a powerful motivator."\par \par \uc2 For a couple of years, Babeu has needed to revive his beloved old nemesis, border-crossing illegal immigrants. A simple planned transfer of detainees to a site just inside the Pinal County line let him do it, as I'm sure his next campaign-finance report will show.\par \par \uc2 Document TUCS000020140716ea7g0000o\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 Opinion\par {\*\bkmkstart toc43}{\*\bkmkend toc43}\b \uc2 Letters to the Editor\b0\par\par\uc2 784 \uc2 words\par \uc2 14 June 2014\par \uc2 The Arizona Daily Star\par \uc2 TUCS\par A09\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 The Arizona Daily Star.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 FLORENCE -- Congressional District 1 candidate Gary Kiehne made extreme comments about gun rights at a Republican primary debate Saturday.\par \par \uc2 Asked how he would protect gun rights, Kiehne said he owns more guns and ammunition than the other candidates and said everyone should own a gun.\par \par \uc2 When it comes to mass shootings, "if you look at all the fiascos that have occurred, 99 percent of them have been by Democrats pulling their guns out and shooting people," Kiehne said to an audience of about 60 people. "So I don't think you have a problem with the Republicans."\par \par \uc2 No one at the debate challenged Kiehne's remark, and Kiehne provided no evidence to support the claim.\par \par \uc2 When it was his turn to answer the question, candidate Adam Kwasman said he supports gun rights and said, "it's a God-given, natural right to keep and bear arms."\par \par \uc2 Tim Sifert, Arizona Republican Party spokesman, declined to comment on Kiehne's remarks, but said the party encourages voters to interact with candidates and vote for the candidate who best represents their views.\par \par \uc2 Candidate Andy Tobin did not attend the event, which was hosted by the Pinal County Republican Committee.\par \par \uc2 The primary election is Aug. 26. The winner of the Republican primary will face incumbent Democrat Ann Kirkpatrick in November. Kirkpatrick did not respond Saturday to a request for comment.\par \par \uc2 Here are a few more issues Kiehne and Kwasman addressed at Saturday's event:\par \par \uc2 VA HOSPITAL PROBLEMS\par \par \uc2 Kiehne and Kwasman agree Veterans Affairs leaders must be held accountable, and Kwasman said Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki should resign.\par \par \uc2 Kiehne said Congress should give whistleblowers protection.\par \par \uc2 Kwasman said the government should get rid of the VA healthcare system and replace it with a voucher system that would let veterans choose their own doctors.\par \par \uc2 IMMIGRATION\par \par \uc2 Kwasman said he's against "any type of legal status or amnesty for those who are here illegally." He supports guest work programs and enforcing employer compliance with the I-9 forms, which state an employee is legally allowed to work in the U.S.\par \par \uc2 He also supports a "double-layer border fence" with National Guard support, he said.\par \par \uc2 "I'm a big fan of people coming in the front door and signing the guest book, not going through the back door and raiding the refrigerator," Kwasman said.\par \par \uc2 Kiehne said deporting every \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  isn't realistic.\par \par \uc2 "I don't believe you can just grab every one of them and send them back to Mexico or wherever they came from," he said. Instead, he would take an inventory of the people who already are here and place them in work programs if they're not criminals.\par \par \uc2 Many illegal immigrants are contributing to society and aren't asking for citizenship, he said. He would allow those people to apply for work-visa programs that allow them to work here for a limited time. Those programs currently require people to apply from their home country.\par \par \uc2 "If you really want to look at the cold, hard facts, I challenge you to go to a construction site anywhere around the Phoenix/Tucson/ Maricopa area and find a framing crew that can speak English," he said. "If you like $100-a-square-foot homebuilding costs, you're gonna love $200-a-square-foot homebuilding costs if you package all of 'em up and send 'em home. The truth is they're here, they're working."\par \par \uc2 Illegal immigrants who are criminals must be deported, he said, and securing the border will help stop smuggling "and the potential terrorists that have been coming across there."\par \par \uc2 BALANCING FEDERAL BUDGET\par \par \uc2 Kwasman said he supports a balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution, including a spending limit. He said the states could act as a board of directors, requiring a supermajority of states to approve any debt ceiling increase.\par \par \uc2 Kiehne said the government should be run more like a business, with Congress offering incentives and bonuses to departments that are efficient and frugal with taxpayers' money.\par \par \uc2 Both candidates said they oppose the expansion of Medicaid and the Common Core school curriculum.\par \par \uc2 On StarNet:\par \par \uc2 Hear an audio clip from the debate at azstarnet.com/multimedia\par \par \uc2 Document TUCS000020140518ea5i0000t\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 News\par {\*\bkmkstart toc46}{\*\bkmkend toc46}\b \uc2 No action taken on most BP charges ; Migrants' complaints of abusehave little effect, review finds\b0\par\par\uc2 Perla Trevizo   \par \uc2 Perla Trevizo Arizona Daily Star\par \uc2 1,343 \uc2 words\par \uc2 7 May 2014\par \uc2 The Arizona Daily Star\par \uc2 TUCS\par A01\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 The Arizona Daily Star.

All allegations of misconduct are taken seriously, and if warranted, referred for appropriate investigative and/or disciplinary action to be taken."\par \par \uc2 Mike Nicley, retired chief of the Border Patrol's Tucson Sector, said the agency had issues with the level of experience in the past when it went through a hiring surge, and agents make mistakes. But overall, the number of complaints filed are a small percentage of total apprehensions and many are not substantiated.\par \par \uc2 It might be that the agent's action is justified, he said, but the person involved doesn't see it that way.\par \par \uc2 More than one in three complaints filed against Border Patrol were directed at agents in the Tucson Sector -- the highest among the nine Southwest border sectors. But when apprehensions were taken into account, Tucson fell to sixth place, with 69.5 complaints filed per 100,000 apprehensions.\par \par \uc2 During the time of the review, Tucson still had the highest number of apprehensions, with more than 200,000 in fiscal years 2009 and 2010. Since, the number has dropped to about 120,000 and Tucson was surpassed last fiscal year by the Rio Grande Valley Sector in Texas, which recorded 154,453 apprehensions.\par \par \uc2 Researchers are just scratching the surface of how complex the system is, said Daniel Martinez, co-author and assistant professor of sociology at The \uc2 George Washington University\uc2  and head of the binational migrant border-crossing study.\par \par \uc2 He said many people don't file formal complaints, especially if they get deported or are afraid due to their legal status.\par \par \uc2 Among the complaints reviewed, 40 percent were still "pending investigation." As of January 2012, one case reviewed had been pending more than two years.\par \par \uc2 Seventy-eight of the cases filed were allegations of physical abuse, or excessive force, the data show. A much smaller number pertained to improper searches or inappropriate touching.\par \par \uc2 CBP, the parent agency of the Border Patrol, has been under increasing scrutiny from Congress, nonprofits and community members for what they consider a lack of accountability and transparency.\par \par \uc2 With more than 4,000 agents, the Border Patrol is one of the largest employers in the region.\par \par \uc2 "The buildup has not been matched with adequate accountability," said Vicki Gaubeca, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's regional center for border rights in New Mexico, during a conference call with reporters Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 Just last week, Mario Alvarado, a Pima County resident and U.S. citizen, filed a lawsuit against a group of Border Patrol agents for what he considered wrongful stops and abuse on multiple occasions during the summer and fall of 2012.\par \par \uc2 He was stopped and referred to secondary inspection at the I-19 checkpoint several times . On at least two occasions, he was detained for eight hours, court documents show.\par \par \uc2 During one of those stops, an agent accused him of being an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , buying his citizenship and being in possession of drugs.\par \par \uc2 Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents also arrested him in September at the port of entry after a code alerted them that Alvarado was armed and dangerous. When the agent looked at the computer system again, it showed a different code. He was released an hour later.\par \par \uc2 Border Patrol never charged Alvarado as a result of any of the multiple detentions, the lawsuit said.\par \par \uc2 Over the last several years, local nonprofits, including No More Deaths, and researchers with the \uc2 University of Arizona\uc2  have published reports that point to physical and verbal abuse of immigrants while in Border Patrol custody.\par \par \uc2 In March, an alliance of immigration advocacy groups launched the website holdcbpaccountable.org to catalog lawsuits and administrative complaints brought against the agency.\par \par \uc2 The ACLU in Arizona recently filed a lawsuit to get records regarding Border Patrol checkpoints amid allegations of civil rights violations and unlawful stops.\par \par \uc2 Representatives of the ACLU and the Women's Refugee Commission, which in 2012 published a report on unaccompanied children crossing the border, said during the conference call they have filed administrative complaints regarding CBP since 2012 and still have not gotten a response.\par \par \uc2 "We need a more effective, meaningful complaint system," said Gaubeca, of the ACLU. "There's no one way to file a complaint. And when we do file a complaint, there's no adequate response."\par \par \uc2 A bill introduced in March aims to do just that.\par \par \uc2 Rep. Beto O'Rourke, a Democrat from El Paso, and Steve Pearce, a Republican from New Mexico, introduced legislation that would create a new complaint system for CBP and an independent oversight commission.\par \par \uc2 "When the results of an investigation are not released timely or the public perceives there's not transparency, that does more damage to the standing of the agency," Nicley said.\par \par \uc2 Often it's not up to the Border Patrol to release the information, he said. "The Border Patrol suffers when information is not made available."\par \par \uc2 Info box\par \par \uc2 HOW TUCSON RANKED?\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 American Immigration Council\uc2  reviewed 809 complaints filed along the southwest border between Jan. 22, 2009 through Jan. 5, 2012.

Let's hope I didn't bother any neighborhood dogs with my delighted yodel.\par \par \uc2 But any celebration is premature.\par \par \uc2 Brewer's conclusion that wielding power and influence with her more than a million bucks in campaign cash will be more rewarding than 1) wrangling over the tenuous legalities of getting on the ballot for a third term; 2) fighting in the Republican primary and 3) hashing through the general election isn't a surprise.\par \par \uc2 We should hardly be stunned that \uc2 Jan Brewer\uc2  has made a decision to advance \uc2 Jan Brewer\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 She cemented her conservative mark by signing the anti-\uc2 illegal- immigrant\uc2  SB 1070 and cultivating an image as a fighter ready to battle the invading hordes of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  headless bodies in the desert. (Much of the law has been struck down, and the portion that remains is unevenly enforced, and she keeps at the illegal immigration, knowing it's a right-wing-crowd favorite.)\par \par \uc2 Brewer pushed Medicaid expansion and an education sales tax, two decisions that advanced good public policy, incidentally, but gave her a degree of credibility with the far-too-silent moderate Republicans and some Democrats.\par \par \uc2 And yes, we all know that she wagged her finger in the face of President Obama. We've seen the photo.\par \par \uc2 Oh, and she vetoed a pro-discrimination bill -- SB 1062 -- after her staff worked on its language. Businesses and sports officials objected to the measure, and she paid attention. In a sad show of how low our expectations have dropped, Democrats even thanked her for her veto of a bill that never should have gotten to her desk.\par \par \uc2 We know that Brewer is ultimately pragmatic. Self-interest in a politician is nothing new, and it's no surprise that she's decided to take her influence on the road.\par \par \uc2 It's what she leaves behind that the rest of us have to worry about.\par \par \uc2 Brewer told Capitol Media Services' Howard Fischer that she plans to use the money she's raised through Jan PAC and her Arizona's Legacy PAC to support pragmatic, not ideological, candidates for national office as well as the state Legislature.\par \par \uc2 Brewer is another Republican who decries the direction of her party -- yet she remains in it, as do many who deplore the current incarnation of the GOP. She told Fischer, "If you didn't agree with 100 percent of those who say they are the leaders, then you weren't a Republican anymore.\par \par \uc2 "They have closed the gates to the tent," Brewer said.\par \par \uc2 "If you don't agree with them, you're not allowed in," she continued. "And if you're in, they want to kick you out."\par \par \uc2 This is where that warning about premature celebration pops up. Because for all the moderates and liberals who are glad to see Brewer leave office -- and there are many -- people who think of themselves as true conservatives are just as pleased.\par \par \uc2 Ultraconservatives have lost no love for Brewer.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 A lengthy Star investigation published last week revealed the highly disparate approach Arizona law enforcement agencies take to enforcing state immigration law SB 1070.\par \par \uc2 Much of the original SB 1070 law was struck down by the \uc2 U.S. Supreme Court\uc2 . But the remaining provision requires officers to inquire about the immigration status of people they stop in the course of other suspected infractions, if they believe the individuals to be in the country illegally. That provision went into effect in September 2012.\par \par \uc2 We opposed SB 1070, and the findings of the Star's news investigation do not change our view.\par \par \uc2 While the 13 Southern Arizona law enforcement agencies queried for data about immigration stops and work with the Border Patrol revealed a troubling dearth of data, some themes emerged:\par \par \uc2 Crime victims and witnesses must be shielded from checks on their immigration status. The same should apply to passengers in vehicles that have been pulled over. This can be done through statute or agency policy. Stops must be prompted by suspicion of a criminal or civil infraction, not an officer's assessment that a person appears to be an undocumented immigrant. A person's likelihood of being reported to the Border Patrol depends on where he's stopped. Agencies differ greatly in how they view and handle immigration stops. Know your rights. Police have struck up conversations with people who are not crime suspects and asked for identification. You don't have to speak with an officer, but most people don't know that they can walk away. Law enforcement should track stops, calls to Border Patrol and criteria used to determine suspicion that a person is undocumented. In response to the Star's investigation, some agencies are already taking those steps.\par \par \uc2 Because of the mismatched enforcement among law enforcement, there's no way to know if SB 1070 is serving as the deterrent to illegal immigration that supporters hoped it would be; and there's no systematic data to show if people are being improperly targeted, stopped or detained.\par \par \uc2 The lack of information is purposeful, because when lawmakers passed it in 2010, they decided requiring agencies to keep such data could be seen as a burden, and cost them "yes" votes in the Legislature.\par \par \uc2 What is clear from the Star's "State of Confusion" investigation is that some officers are doing immigration enforcement. They call Border Patrol to do the processing, but local officers start the ball rolling by approaching a suspected \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , even when no infraction is identified in case reports.\par \par \uc2 These facts are troubling. Every dubious stop corrodes the already often tenuous relationship between law enforcement and vulnerable communities.\par \par \uc2 A powerful voice of reason comes from the South Tucson Police Department. Officer Yvonne Billotte told the Star that fears police are working with immigration authorities has had an effect on the community she has served for 12 years.\par \par \uc2 "My biggest concern with 1070 is that it takes someone who is not documented and makes him the perfect victim because they are now afraid to report crime, and it destroys that relationship with us," she said.\par \par \uc2 "I always tell people: 'I don't care about your immigration status,'" Billotte said. "What I care about is people not being victimized."\par \par \uc2 The best fix to problems with SB 1070 is comprehensive immigration reform that creates a fair and realistic path to legal status for those now in the country illegally -- but it's highly unlikely that will happen any time soon.\par \par \uc2 In the meantime, SB 1070 will remain. Changes must be made to make the enforcement reasonable, legal and proportional. Protection of local communities, not immigration violations, should be the top priority of law enforcement.\par \par \uc2 Document TUCS000020140314ea3900039\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 News\par {\*\bkmkstart toc51}{\*\bkmkend toc51}\b \uc2 Border chief: Security requires new approach ; Johnson, during AZ tour, says US needs to be creative, agile\b0\par\par\uc2 Joseph Trevino   \par \uc2 Joseph Trevino Arizona Daily Star\par \uc2 559 \uc2 words\par \uc2 23 January 2014\par \uc2 The Arizona Daily Star\par \uc2 TUCS\par A01\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 The Arizona Daily Star.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHOENIX -- A federal appeals court agreed Thursday to hear new arguments about whether Arizona voters can legally deny bail to some people charged with crimes who are in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 In a brief order, Alex Kozinski, chief judge of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, said enough of his colleagues want to review last year's divided ruling by a three-judge panel of the court to uphold the 2006 constitutional provision. A hearing before an 11-judge panel was set for March.\par \par \uc2 Attorney Tim Casey, representing Maricopa County, argued that the law is constitutional, at least in part because it "serves a compelling interest" by ensuring defendants charged with felonies remain in this country until trial.\par \par \uc2 But Cecilia Wang, an American Civil Liberties Union attorney, said the real purpose behind the law is to punish people who are in this country illegally. She argued there is no legal reason to impose a blanket prohibition on bail.\par \par \uc2 The voter-approved law makes bail unavailable to those charged with "serious felony offenses'' if they are in this country illegally and if there is enough evidence "the presumption great" that the person is guilty of the offense charged.\par \par \uc2 It was crafted by former Republican state Senate President Russell Pearce -- at the time a state representative -- who argued that anyone who has crossed the border illegally probably has few ties to this country. That, he said, makes them at greater risk of fleeing before trial.\par \par \uc2 Voters approved the constitutional amendment by a 3-1 ratio.\par \par \uc2 A trial judge upheld the measure, as did that three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit in a 2-1 decision. But Wang said those rulings run contrary to constitutional requirements that essentially say the sole purpose of bail is to ensure that those charged with certain crimes show up in court.\par \par \uc2 "It does away with individualized determinations about people's flight risk, turns the presumption of innocence on its head, in essence, and holds people in jail even though they might be found not to pose a flight risk by a court," she said.\par \par \uc2 Wang said only when a judge determines no amount of bail would prevent someone from fleeing can that person be held until trial. And there are reasons for some across-the-board prohibitions on bail for those accused of capital offenses and those who previously have jumped bail.\par \par \uc2 She said, though, there is no reason to presume that someone who has been in the country for years, has a family here and is working will flee just because he or she is charged with a minor felony, one for which the penalty might be little more than probation.\par \par \uc2 As proof, she said there were people who were awaiting trial at the time the law was approved who had been out on bail, were showing up for court hearings as required -- and then were taken into custody solely because of the new requirement.\par \par \uc2 "And that's just a blatant due-process violation," Wang said.\par \par \uc2 But Casey, in his legal filings, pointed out that the three- judge panel rejected that contention.\par \par \uc2 In the majority ruling, Judge Richard Tallman said while it is clear that lawmakers who put the issue on the ballot were concerned about illegal immigration, "a fair reading of the record does not support (challengers') argument that Proposition 100's primary purpose is to punish and deter immigration offenses.''\par \par \uc2 Casey also said the \uc2 U.S. Supreme Court\uc2  has concluded the mere fact that someone is detained does not necessarily lead to the conclusion the government is imposing punishment.\par \par \uc2 He said there are sufficient protections built in, including the right to a prompt hearing on bail and the fact that defendants are entitled to have their cases tried within 150 days.\par \par \uc2 Wang, however, has cited other evidence, including some comments made by Pearce at the time.\par \par \uc2 She said Pearce said he wanted to "end this (federal) system of catch and release" and the measure was one of several to "make sure there are consequences and punishments'' attached to being an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 ."\par \par \uc2 Document TUCS000020140328ea130056h\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 News\par {\*\bkmkstart toc53}{\*\bkmkend toc53}\b \uc2 Public can see emails that led to SB 1070 ; Federal judge opens records; group seeks evidence of bias\b0\par\par\uc2 Howard Fischer   \par \uc2 Howard Fischer Capitol Media Services\par \uc2 890 \uc2 words\par \uc2 2 January 2014\par \uc2 The Arizona Daily Star\par \uc2 TUCS\par A01\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 The Arizona Daily Star.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHOENIX -- A federal judge will allow challengers to Arizona's major law targeting illegal immigration to see what advocacy groups were advising legislators in emails, letters and memos while the law was written. The challengers are looking for any indication of racial bias.\par \par \uc2 U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton rejected arguments by the \uc2 Federation for American Immigration Reform\uc2  and the Immigration Reform Law Institute that the messages they sent to lawmakers who crafted and supported SB 1070 are private. Bolton also said that communications from legislators to either group cannot be shielded from public view, either.\par \par \uc2 The ruling is a significant victory for those who have been working since the law was enacted in 2010 to have it -- and especially its "papers, please" provision -- declared unconstitutional.\par \par \uc2 That's because the lawsuit is based in part on claims that the Legislature acted in a way to purposely discriminate against Hispanics and other minorities, violating the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution.\par \par \uc2 Victor Viramontes of the \uc2 Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund\uc2  said those communications could prove that the real intent was racial bias and not simply a bid to help the federal government enforce laws against illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 SB 1070 contained a variety of measures aimed at giving police more power to detain people they believe are in the United States illegally.\par \par \uc2 Several of those sections were voided by the \uc2 U.S. Supreme Court\uc2 , including making it a crime for an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  to apply for work in a public place and allowing police to arrest someone in this country illegally for failing to carry federally issued immigration cards.\par \par \uc2 But the justices refused to set aside another provision that requires police to try to determine the immigration status of someone they have already stopped if there is "reasonable suspicion" that person is unlawfully in the country. The court said there was no reason to believe that, as written, the measure is pre-empted by federal law.\par \par \uc2 What the high court never addressed -- and what remains in front of Bolton -- is a separate question of whether the provision violates the equal protection rights of minorities. That, Viramontes said, requires proof of "racial animus."\par \par \uc2 "You look at what legislators were saying around the time that they passed the law, and what people who were talking to legislators were saying around the time that the law was passed," he said.\par \par \uc2 "Here, you have prominent proponents of SB 1070 talking to each other," Viramontes continued. "And we would like to know what they said to each other."\par \par \uc2 Challengers are clearly looking for evidence of racial intent. The subpoenas specifically ask for communications with words like "alien," "day laborer," "illegals," "Mexican," "profiling," "Spanish," "undocumented" and "wetback."\par \par \uc2 Attorneys for the two groups told Bolton the subpoenas would interfere with their First Amendment rights to communicate with legislators.\par \par \uc2 But the judge said nothing in the request interferes with that right. She there is nothing in law that "protects from public view communications with public officials in their official capacity about a matter of public concern."\par \par \uc2 Anyway, Bolton said, communications to public officials are public records under Arizona law. The challengers are seeking them from the two groups because the Legislature routinely destroys emails after 90 days.\par \par \uc2 The judge also rebuffed contentions that the communications are irrelevant, noting that challengers have to show "proof of racially discriminatory intent or purpose in the enactment of SB 1070." That, she said, requires an inquiry into not only the purpose of the law as stated publicly by sponsors but a look at "circumstantial and direct evidence of intent as may be available."\par \par \uc2 And Bolton ruled that the communications sought are likely to contain admissible evidence themselves or, at the very least, lead to the discovery of evidence of legislative intent.\par \par \uc2 Bolton also dismissed claims by the two groups that they were providing legal advice to lawmakers, something generally off-limits to disclosure. She said the evidence shows no evidence of a formal attorney-client relationship, saying the groups "were offering policy -- not legal -- advice."\par \par \uc2 More is at issue than just the future of the ability of police to detain and question those suspected of being in this country illegally.\par \par \uc2 Still being litigated are several other provisions of SB 1070 that never made it to the Supreme Court, though a federal appeals court has blocked them from being enforced while the case plays out in Bolton's court.\par \par \uc2 One makes it a crime for someone looking for work to enter a car stopped on the street. It also criminalizes drivers who stop to pick up laborers.\par \par \uc2 Another makes it illegal under state law to knowingly transport or harbor those in this country illegally.\par \par \uc2 Bolton's ruling covers more than just the communications about SB 1070. Challengers also want to see emails and other documents related to crafting various other prior measures dealing with illegal immigration in the years before SB 1070 was adopted.\par \par \uc2 "It is reasonable to conclude that the intentions behind those bills were similar, if not identical, to the intentions behind SB 1070," Bolton wrote. She called them "part of the historical background" of the enactment of SB 1070 and therefore relevant.\par \par \uc2 Document TUCS000020140328ea120053k\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 Metro\par {\*\bkmkstart toc54}{\*\bkmkend toc54}\b \uc2 Sheriff: Man killed cellmate to stay in prison\b0\par\par\uc2 Veronica M Cruz   \par \uc2 Veronica M.

He said he will pursue other colleges that have adopted similar policies, including Pima Community College.\par \par \uc2 The meeting turned ugly at several points, with some participants telling Horne he has no moral right to decide the issue, citing a series of Horne's legal problems, including a bump-and-run accident to which he pleaded no contest earlier this year and a finding by Yavapai County Attorney Shelia Polk that he violated campaign finance laws, a contention he disputes.\par \par \uc2 One attendee was arrested and charged with trespass for refusing to leave the office in protest of Horne's refusal to reverse his position.\par \par \uc2 Besides limiting resident tuition to citizens and legal residents, the 2006 initiative mandates higher tuition must be charged to those who are "without lawful immigration status,'' and denies any form of financial help "that is subsidized or paid in whole or in part with state monies.''\par \par \uc2 The DACA program, approved last year by the Obama administration, is available to those who arrived in this country as children but are not here legally.

Sonaba con ser uno de esos soldados cuando creciera, pero el sabia que no seria posible.\par \par \uc2 Gonzalez crecio en Arizona sin contar con un estatus legal. Sus padrinos lo cruzaron por la garita de entrada cuando apenas tenia seis meses de edad.\par \par \uc2 En medio del punto muerto por el que politicamente atraviesa la reforma migratoria, los jovenes como Gonzalez tienen mas apoyo en ambos partidos que cualquier otro grupo de inmigrantes ilegales, pero sigue siendo una batalla cuesta arriba.\par \par \uc2 En el proyecto de ley aprobado por el Senado en junio, los legisladores ofrecieron a los "Dreamers" o "Sonadores" -jovenes que fueron traidos al pais sin documentos siendo ninos y que cumplen ciertos requisitos- un camino mas rapido y facil hacia un estatus legal permanente e incluso a la ciudadania.\par \par \uc2 Este verano, los republicanos Eric Cantor y Bob Goodlatte dijeron que estaban trabajando en la tambien llamada Ley de NINOS o KIDS Act. Pero el borrador de esa ley no se ha hecho publico y no esta claro si incluiria un camino a la residencia legal permanente.\par \par \uc2 Aun cuando muchos politicos de ambos lados dicen que simpatizan con las demandas de los Sonadores, los oponentes argumentan que la ley esta primero.\par \par \uc2 "Si legalizas a gente que esta en este pais violando la ley y les condonas la aplicacion de la misma -incluso si ellos eran ninos y exentas a sus padres de la aplicacion de la ley, especialmente si fueron ellos los que los trajeron a este punto- entonces, ?ante quien aplicas la fuerza de la ley?", dijo el diputado republicano por Iowa Steve King, durante una audiencia del Comite Judicial de la Camara.\par \par \uc2 Gonzalez estuvo entre los primeros en obtener la Accion Diferida en septiembre de 2012. Mas de medio millon de personas la solicitaron a nivel nacional el ano pasado, de los cuales alrededor de 20 mil eran de Arizona.\par \par \uc2 "Para mi fue como un milagro cuando me llego", dijo. "Despues de todos estos 18 anos batallando, al final habia una esperanza. Todo por lo que habia luchado estaba siendo compensado".\par \par \uc2 Gonzalez se entero de su estatus legal cuando tenia 10 anos de edad.\par \par \uc2 "Mi amigo Matthew siempre me habia invitado a San Carlos, donde tenian casa, pero mis papas nunca me habian dejado ir", dijo.\par \par \uc2 Un dia le dijeron que si iba, ya no podria volver.\par \par \uc2 "Me senti atrapado", dijo Gonzalez. "Sabia que nada volveria a ser igual".\par \par \uc2 Mientras que sus companeros de la escuela cruzaban la frontera para ir a cortarse el pelo, ir a comer o a jugar futbol, el se tenia que quedar en su casa en Rio Rico. Ni siquiera ir a Tucson, que esta 60 millas al Norte, era posible, porque hay un punto de revision de la Patrulla Fronteriza en la carretera Interestatal 19, a menos de 20 minutos de su casa.\par \par \uc2 Con la Accion Diferida, ahora tiene un empleo cuidando mascotas en Amado, cerca de Rio Rico, y cruza todos los dias el punto de revision. Pero los beneficios de DACA (siglas por las que es conocido el programa) son limitados y desiguales en todo el pais, dicen los expertos.\par \par \uc2 "Vemos que DACA les ha dado a los adultos jovenes a los que se dirige un amplio acceso al sueno americano", dijo Roberto Gonzales, profesor asistente en la Escuela de Postgrado en Educacion de Harvard, quien ha investigado a los sonadores durante 10 anos.\par \par \uc2 Muchos han abierto cuentas bancarias, obtenido tarjetas de credito y pagado cuotas escolares como residentes, dijo.\par \par \uc2 Aun asi, "muchos de nuestros encuestados estan muy preocupados sobre que pasara despues de dos anos, que sucedera con los miembros de sus familias y sus amigos".\par \par \uc2 Arizona es uno de los dos estados que no expide licencias de conducir a los receptores de DACA, lo que para muchos era uno de los principales beneficios del programa.\par \par \uc2 Algunas veces Gonzalez tiene que manejar para ir a trabajar, y tiene miedo de ser detenido y deportado. Pero dice que no tiene otra opcion. Tiene que trabajar.\par \par \uc2 Viajar a sus paises de origen tambien ha resultado dificil y confuso, reporto el Centro de Politicas de Inmigracion. No hay garantia de que se les permita regresar a Estados Unidos y solo pueden ir por motivos humanitarios, educativos o de trabajo.\par \par \uc2 Luis Parra, abogado local que representa a Gonzalez, solicito por anticipado la libertad condicional bajo palabra, basicamente un permiso emitido por el gobierno para permitirle a Gonzalez ir a Nogales, Sonora, a ver a su abuela, quien tiene cancer. La solicitud fue negada porque la abuela no es considerada un familiar directo.\par \par \uc2 Parra tambien esta ayudando a Gonzalez a conseguir un estatus legal a traves de su esposa Claudia, ciudadana norteamericana de Texas. Pero tambien eso parece ser mas complicado de lo previsto. Gonzalez debe probar que en realidad un oficial de aduanas le dio el pase cuando era un bebe.\par \par \uc2 Podria regresar a Mexico y solicitar la residencia desde alla, pero corre el riesgo de que durante tes anos se le impida volver por haber vivido ilegalmente en Estados Unidos durante mas de seis meses siendo adulto.\par \par \uc2 Gonzalez cumplio 18 anos en enero y obtuvo la Accion diferida hasta septiembre, ocho meses despues.\par \par \uc2 "Los receptores de DACA... simplemente somos estudiantes que queremos recibir una educacion y contribuir al crecimiento de este pais, pero no lo podremos hacer con tantos contratiempos", dijo Gonzalez en la sala de su casa en Rio Rico.\par \par \uc2 "Seguire luchando y me mantendre positivo", dijo. "Voy a probarme a mi mismo y a hacer algo bueno por este pais".\par \par \uc2 ENGLISH\par \par \uc2 Abdiel Gonzalez has always liked history.\par \par \uc2 In school, he enjoyed reading about how soldiers helped protect the country. He dreamed of being one of those soldiers when he grew up, but he knew that wouldn't be possible.\par \par \uc2 Gonzalez grew up in Arizona without legal status. His godparents took him through the port of entry when he was just six months old.\par \par \uc2 Amid the political impasse on immigration reform, young people like Gonzalez have more support from members of both parties than any other \uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2  group -- but it's still an uphill battle.\par \par \uc2 In the bill the Senate passed in June, lawmakers offered "Dreamers" -- youths who were brought to this country illegally by their parents and who meet certain criteria -- a more expedient path to legal permanent status and eventual citizenship.\par \par \uc2 This summer, Republicans Eric Cantor and Bob Goodlatte said they are working on a so-called KIDS Act. But a draft bill hasn't been made public, and it's unclear if it will include a path to permanent legal status.\par \par \uc2 Even though many politicians on both sides of the aisle say they sympathize with the plight of Dreamers, opponents argue the law comes first.\par \par \uc2 "If you legalize people that are here in this country unlawfully and you waive the application -- even if they were children and you waive the application of the law on their parents, especially if they are the ones that brought them to commit this act, then who do you enforce the law against?" Rep. Steve King, a Republican from Iowa, said during a House Judiciary Committee hearing.\par \par \uc2 Gonzalez was among the first ones to get deferred action in September 2012. More than half a million people have applied nationwide -- about 20,000 from Arizona -- in the past year.\par \par \uc2 "For me, it was like a miracle when I got it," he said. "All these 18 years of struggling -- finally there was some hope. Everything I had fought for was being compensated."\par \par \uc2 Gonzalez learned about his legal status when he was 10.\par \par \uc2 "My friend Matthew would always invite me to San Carlos where they had a home, but my parents would never let me go," he said.\par \par \uc2 Eventually they told him that if he left, he wouldn't be able to come back.\par \par \uc2 "I felt trapped," Gonzalez said. "I knew nothing would be the same."\par \par \uc2 While classmates went across the border to get a haircut, grab a bite or play soccer, he had to stay home in Rio Rico. Even a trip to Tucson, about 60 miles north, wasn't possible because there's a Border Patrol checkpoint on Interstate 19, less than 20 miles from his house.\par \par \uc2 With deferred action, he now has a job caring for pets in nearby Amado and goes through the checkpoint every day. But the benefits of DACA, as the program is known, are limited and uneven nationwide, experts say.\par \par \uc2 "We see that DACA has provided young adult beneficiaries with wider access to the American dream," said Roberto Gonzales, an assistant professor of education at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, who has researched Dreamers for 10 years.\par \par \uc2 Many have opened bank accounts, gotten credit cards, pay in- state tuition, he said.\par \par \uc2 Still, "many of our respondents are very worried about what's going to happen after two years, what's going to happen to their family members and friends."\par \par \uc2 Arizona is one of two states that don't issue driver's licenses to DACA recipients, which for many was one of the main benefits of applying for the program.\par \par \uc2 Gonzalez sometimes has to drive himself to work, and he fears being pulled over and eventually deported. But he has no other option, he said. He has to work.\par \par \uc2 Traveling to their native countries has also proved challenging and confusing, the Immigration Policy Center reported. There's no guarantee they will be allowed back into the United States and they can only go for humanitarian, educational or employment purposes.\par \par \uc2 Luis Parra, a local attorney who represents Gonzalez, applied for advanced parole, essentially a permission slip from the government to allow Gonzalez to travel to Nogales, Sonora, to see his grandmother, who has cancer. The request was denied because she's not considered an immediate relative.\par \par \uc2 Parra is also helping Gonzalez adjust his status through his wife, Claudia, a U.S. citizen from Texas. But that has also turned out to be more complicated than anticipated. Gonzalez needs to prove the customs officer actually waved him through when he was a toddler.\par \par \uc2 He could return to Mexico and apply from there, but he risks being barred from returning for three years for living in the country illegally for more than six months as an adult.\par \par \uc2 Gonzalez turned 18 in January and didn't get deferred action until September -- eight months later.\par \par \uc2 "DACA recipients ... we are just students who want to have an education and contribute to the growth of this country, but we can't do so with so many setbacks," Gonzalez said in the living room of his Rio Rico home.\par \par \uc2 "I'll keep fighting and staying positive," he said.

But this story indicates they may have been deceiving us.\par \par \uc2 The number of illegal immigrants living in the U.S. has risen between 2009 and 2012, and the number of illegal immigrants entering the country has been on the increase. This should be no surprise, however. As long as we continue to reward lawbreakers with things such as college tuition breaks, jobs and various other advantages over those who would come here legally, we should expect illegals to continue to disregard our borders and our laws.

There's a lawsuit pending against Gov. \uc2 Jan Brewer\uc2 's executive order.\par \par \uc2 Saldivar said he hasn't been able to find a job in part because he relies on public transportation.\par \par \uc2 "I've had to decline interviews because of the time it would take me to just get there," he said.

John McCain pushed for comprehensive immigration reform that includes a path to citizenship for the 11 million people estimated to be living in the country illegally during a town-hall meeting Tuesday in Tucson.\par \par \uc2 I m asking you to consider that we have an unacceptable situation as it is today and we need to all work together no matter where we are in the political spectrum to try to resolve this issue, he told a group of about 150 people packed inside a conference room in the Herbert K. Abrams Public Health Center, on the city s south side.\par \par \uc2 The Senate passed comprehensive immigration reform legislation in June but House leaders have said they will instead draft their own series of bills. Initially, the Senate s Gang of Eight and the White House pushed against a piecemeal approach but have now said they would be fine with it.\par \par \uc2 I would like to see the House of Representatives pass legislation, whether it is piecemeal or however they want to. I m not trying to tell them how they should do it, McCain said Tuesday. He said the focus should be on producing legislation that can pass in both the Senate and the House and be signed by the president.\par \par \uc2 He spoke for about 15 minutes on immigration before taking questions.\par \par \uc2 I don t think that any legislation that is a series of compromises that need to be made is perfect, but I also would submit to you that & he paused as he tried to fix the microphone, that this microphone is provided to you by the Democratic National Committee, he finished to a laughing audience.\par \par \uc2 McCain went over the general provisions of the bill: people would have to pay fines, learn English and get in back of the line to become U.S. citizens. The border would also need to be secured.\par \par \uc2 There are people in this room who will say the border is not secure, he said. The border is not secure but it s a lot more secured than in 1986 when we gave amnesty to 3 million people and the answer to border security is technology.\par \par \uc2 Ana Karina Rodriguez, with Mi Familia Vota, asked what people in Arizona can do to help the community understand the importance of the bill. The national organization works with the Latino community on civic engagement.\par \par \uc2 You need to be active, but I urge you to be respectful, McCain said. It s especially important on an issue as emotional as this.\par \par \uc2 He also described comments from Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, that for every \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who is valedictorian, there s another 100 out there who weigh 130 pounds and they ve got calves the size of cantaloupes because they re hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert, as outrageous.\par \par \uc2 It s very harmful to the dialogue and the environment we want to foster in America where we are all God s children, he said. You got to be respectful of everybody s views and it s taken me a while to learn that.\par \par \uc2 Although he answered questions on everything from sexual assault in the military to the budget, guns and immigration dominated the more than an hour-long meeting.\par \par \uc2 Victims of gun violence thanked McCain for his support to strengthen background checks on gun sales and asked what else they could do to bring attention to the issue.\par \par \uc2 The first question McCain took was from \uc2 John Green\uc2 , father of Christina-Taylor Green, the 9-year-old girl killed on Jan. 8, 2011 at a constituent meeting with then-U.S. Rep. \uc2 Gabrielle Giffords\uc2  outside a Safeway store. Six people were killed in the shooting and 13 were wounded, including Giffords.\par \par \uc2 Thank you first of all for all of your support. Since we lost Christina you were right there with us, he said, and asked if they could have a meeting with him and Sen. Jeff Flake to talk about common-sense solutions to background checks.\par \par \uc2 I d be honored to do so, McCain responded.\par \par \uc2 On other issues, McCain called disgraceful the $13 million the federal government spent on 21 houses in Ajo to attract Customs and Border Protection personnel reported this week by The Arizona Republic and said the waste couldn t be justified, people should be fired.\par \par \uc2 On the Justice Department s decision not to file charges against two Border Patrol agents who shot and killed two teens along the border: Every citizen in this country has the benefit of innocence until proven guilty, he said, and added thorough investigations need to be conducted and, if needed, congressional oversight.\par \par \uc2 Contact reporter Perla Trevizo at ptrevizo@azstarnet.com or 573- 4210.

The changes take effect in the 2013-14 budget year, which starts July 1.\par \par \uc2 Property taxes are the largest source of funding for PCC, with tuition the second-largest.\par \par \uc2 Even with the tax and tuition increases, PCC plans to spend about $15 million less next year than this year - $284 million instead of $299 million.\par \par \uc2 Most of the drop in spending is directly linked to an 11 percent drop in PCC enrollment this year. About $10 million of the decrease, for example, is due to reductions in federal aid now that the school has fewer students.\par \par \uc2 Some PCC board members mistakenly assumed the new budget is lower because college executives had taken vigorous steps to cut costs.\par \par \uc2 "I think you worked very hard to have us lower our budget by $15 million," board Chairwoman Brenda Even told PCC finance boss David Bea.\par \par \uc2 Bea didn't correct her publicly but acknowledged in an interview after the vote that most of the spending reductions were not the result of his efforts.\par \par \uc2 PCC also expects to collect about $1 million less in out-of- state tuition fees next year after the board recently voted to stop charging the higher fees to some \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students.

Economic conditions in Central America, coupled with increasing violence there, is pushing more Central Americans to migrate north, said Daniel Martinez, assistant professor in the department of sociology at \uc2 George Washington University\uc2  and co- author of the report, which was released Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 Illegal immigrants from countries other than Mexico - mostly Central Americans - have increased from 9 percent of all deaths between 2000 and 2005 to 17 percent between 2006 and 2012.\par \par \uc2 unknowns about deaths\par \par \uc2 Since 1990, more than 2,000 remains have been examined by the Pima County Office of the Medical Examiner.\par \par \uc2 But when it comes to migrant deaths, there still are a lot of unknowns.\par \par \uc2 "Nobody has the real number of people who have died while crossing illegally," said Dr. Gregory Hess, Pima County's chief medical examiner and one of the authors of the report. "Part of the goal is to try to provide a national model to do that."\par \par \uc2 The way his office counts illegal immigrants' deaths is by using the date when the remains are found, but the people could have perished weeks, months or even years before they were discovered.\par \par \uc2 Nearly 800 remains, or 34 percent, haven't been identified. The Pima County office now handles more unidentified remains per capita than any other medical examiner's office in the country.\par \par \uc2 More in remote areas\par \par \uc2 People are also being discovered in more remote areas and in more decomposed conditions, the report states.\par \par \uc2 The leading cause of death between 2006 and 2012 is "undetermined," but Robin Reineke, co-author and doctoral candidate of the UA School of Anthropology, said there's a big possibility many of those deaths are a result of exposure to the elements.\par \par \uc2 "Keep in mind with these studies we are dealing with a brand new phenomenon with deaths in this country," said Raquel Rubio- Goldsmith, adjunct professor in Mexican-American Studies at the UA and a co-author.\par \par \uc2 "We don't call this a disaster in a legal sense," she said, "but in a sense we are dealing with a national disaster."\par \par \uc2 The increase in border deaths has coincided with intensified enforcement efforts across the border.\par \par \uc2 When border enforcement efforts first began in the early 1990s, remote areas along the California-Baja California border experienced significant increases in \uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2  deaths.\par \par \uc2 In the first few years of the 2000s, the increase in deaths appeared to shift east into Southern Arizona, the report said. The number of remains found in Southern Arizona jumped from 19 in 1999 to 71 in 2000 - and doubled by 2002.\par \par \uc2 Now counties close to the south Texas-Tamaulipas border have begun reporting higher numbers of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  deaths. For example, the number of remains found in Brooks County, a rural county in south Texas, went from 20 in 2010 to 129 in 2012.\par \par \uc2 With the proposed comprehensive immigration reform bill calling for even more border security measures, the number of illegal immigrants dying could continue rising, especially as the economy recovers, Martinez said.\par \par \uc2 Answers to illegal immigration "don't lie in more border security," he said.\par \par \uc2 Sen. Flake's viewpoint\par \par \uc2 Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake "believes that the lack of a workable legal framework for foreign labor to enter and leave the country is more responsible for migrant deaths than an increase in border security, and that's a problem that the Senate immigration reform bill addresses," Flake's spokeswoman, Genevieve Rozansky, said in an email.\par \par \uc2 The current bill revamps guest-worker programs for high- and lower-skilled jobs and seeks to better match labor demands with supply, but it would also add up to $6.5 billion to securing the border.\par \par \uc2 Researchers said they hope policymakers consider the findings as they debate "what is arguably the single most important piece of immigration legislation in nearly three decades."\par \par \uc2 Contact reporter Perla Trevizo at ptrevizo@azstarnet.com or at 573-4213.

In Tucson, competition for them may be heating up as Phoenix-based \uc2 Grand Canyon University\uc2  seeks to build a local campus it hopes will attract 5,000 or more area students.\par \par \uc2 The for-profit Christian school isn't interested in just any students - only those with grade-point averages of 3.0 or higher. And it plans to sweeten the deal by offering cut-rate tuition tied to academic performance.\par \par \uc2 "Our long-term goal is to make higher education more affordable," said GCU spokesman \uc2 Bill Jenkins\uc2 . He said the school's tuition structure was designed to be "very, very competitive with public universities."\par \par \uc2 GCU still hasn't found a metro Tucson location after city leaders nixed a proposal for the west-side El Rio Golf Course. But school officials say they're still keen to have a presence here.\par \par \uc2 Many local churches are eager to see it happen. And the Christian school also may appeal to so-called Dreamers, who were brought to this country as the children of illegal immigrants. They can earn four-year degrees at GCU for a fraction of what they'd pay at the state's three public universities because GCU doesn't charge higher out-of-state tuition.\par \par \uc2 For now, at least, all Dreamers must pay out-of-state tuition to attend the \uc2 University of Arizona\uc2 , \uc2 Arizona State University\uc2  or Northern Arizona University.\par \par \uc2 At the UA, where the minimum grade-point average for freshmen is 2.0 although 83 percent last year had a 3.0 or higher, officials say they'd welcome the new player on the local higher-education scene.\par \par \uc2 "I'm a proponent of \uc2 Grand Canyon University\uc2 . I think they're doing great things," said John Nametz, UA's director of student financial aid.\par \par \uc2 "Are they competing with us? Yes and no," he said.\par \par \uc2 Strengths, challenges\par \par \uc2 While GCU has strengths, such as its popular nursing and teacher- training programs, it can't rival UA's extensive research opportunities and doesn't offer degree programs for those looking to become doctors, engineers and many other types of professionals.\par \par \uc2 GCU has relatively few master's and doctoral programs - 38, compared to 223 at UA. That stands to benefit UA's graduate school, which can offer many more choices to GCU grads who want to continue their educations, Nametz said.\par \par \uc2 Spokesman Jenkins said GCU - accredited by the same outfit that accredits UA - uses profits from its extensive online programs to reduce the cost of attendance on-campus.\par \par \uc2 While its current tuition rate is $16,500 a year, "the average student is paying $7,800 a year," Jenkins said, because the school provides hefty scholarships that increase in value as a student's grade-point average rises. That would continue in Tucson, he said.\par \par \uc2 The UA also offers scholarships and other help. Nametz said about half of UA freshmen don't pay anything out of pocket their first year once aid is factored in.\par \par \uc2 GCU has some substantial challenges to overcome.\par \par \uc2 Most of its students - 69 percent - didn't graduate within six years of starting a four-year degree program, according to federal Education Department statistics citing 2011 data, the most recent available, on its website.\par \par \uc2 By comparison, 39 percent of UA students didn't graduate within the same period.\par \par \uc2 GCU's dropout rates are also much higher that UA's. About 41 percent of GCU freshmen didn't come back for their sophomore year, compared to 23 percent of UA freshmen, statistics show.\par \par \uc2 Jenkins said GCU has made improvements in recent years, such as tightening admissions standards from a minimum 2.5 to a minimum 3.0 GPA.\par \par \uc2 The school's current graduation rate is above 50 percent, and its retention rate is 87 percent, he said.\par \par \uc2 "Not a church"\par \par \uc2 Though billed as a Christian university, GCU isn't especially heavy on religion. In fact, it may be less religious now than at any point in its 64-year history.\par \par \uc2 Before it became a for-profit, GCU was run for decades by the Southern Baptist Convention. That ended in 2003, when private investors stepped in to rescue the struggling school from possible bankruptcy.\par \par \uc2 Some GCU staffers still lament that the change watered down the school's Christian focus, said Vincent Jones of Tucson, who graduated from GCU in 2011 with a degree in physical education.\par \par \uc2 Students no longer are required to attend chapel services, for example, and "some of the staff weren't happy about that," said Jones, 29, a 2003 graduate of Salpointe Catholic High School.\par \par \uc2 Jones said GCU gave him a good education, and said class sizes there were much smaller than they would have been at UA . His largest class had 20 students, he said, and the smallest had four. He said he's now studying online at GCU for a master's degree in special education.\par \par \uc2 For those so inclined, there is no shortage of Bible-based courses at GCU. Only one is required for all students. It's called "Christian World View," but those of other faiths can share their beliefs in comparison to Christianity, Jenkins said.\par \par \uc2 "You do not have to be Christian to attend \uc2 Grand Canyon University\uc2 ," he said. "We are not a church."\par \par \uc2 The school's mission statement says it aims to produce global citizens who "avoid ethnocentrism and embrace the reality that people are different with different perspectives on history, religion, value systems, and many other aspects of life and living."\par \par \uc2 Many local Christian leaders are enthused about the prospect of a GCU campus in the Tucson area.\par \par \uc2 "I think it would be great," said Jay George, pastor for the past 20 years at Tucson Mountain Baptist Church, 5757 W. Ajo Way.\par \par \uc2 He said many of his flock have attended GCU in Phoenix over the years and went on to become successful in teaching, nursing and other fields.\par \par \uc2 George also is involved with the Catalina Baptist Association, which represents dozens of churches in Pima County. Many of them also are looking forward to having GCU in town, he said.\par \par \uc2 Noncitizen scholars\par \par \uc2 In Phoenix, GCU's tuition setup has attracted hundreds of high- performing high school students who lack U.S. citizenship because their parents brought them here illegally as children.\par \par \uc2 Arizona's public universities all charge much higher tuition to such students. At UA, for example, American students who live in- state pay tuition of just over $10,000 a year, while non-citizens pay more than $26,000.\par \par \uc2 GCU doesn't have different rates based on citizenship. As a result, its Phoenix campus attracted about 300 noncitizen students last term -about 5 percent of the student body.\par \par \uc2 A Tucson group that aids young immigrants estimates Pima County is home to as many as 4,000 \uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2  students, though it isn't clear how many would have grade-point averages high enough to qualify for admission to GCU.\par \par \uc2 Jenkins said interest in Phoenix has been so strong that GCU has started a college-readiness program there at a high school whose student body is 98 percent Latino and includes many noncitizens.\par \par \uc2 "These are kids who never really thought they'd have a chance to go to college," he said.

The figure rises to 70 percent when counting only those who consider the United States home.\par \par \uc2 The portrait of the average \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  had been that of seasonal laborers and young single men with no real ties to the United States. But as enforcement and the cost of crossing illegally has increased, experts say many have decided to build their lives here instead of going back and forth.\par \par \uc2 Among those who were interviewed, one-fourth said they had U.S.- born children and 28 percent considered the United States home.\par \par \uc2 As lawmakers continue to debate what should be in an immigration reform bill, a guest-worker program and more highly skilled immigrants have gained consensus, but Martinez said it's time to think outside the box.\par \par \uc2 "We need to look at the root causes of immigration to really understand," he said. Seeing a guest-worker program as the only solution is 10 to 15 years too late.\par \par \uc2 And "high-skilled immigration is an important component of immigration reform, but what's missing from the current debate is the issue of family values," Scott Whiteford, professor at the Center for Latin American Studies, said at the UA news conference.\par \par \uc2 The Border Patrol shifted to a "consequence delivery system" in 2011, where basically illegal immigrants are put through different programs with the goal that they won't try to cross again.\par \par \uc2 As a result, Customs and Border Protection officials have said, the recidivism rate along the Southwest border dropped from 24 percent in fiscal year 2010 to 17 percent in 2012.\par \par \uc2 But Jeremy Slack, also an author of the study and a doctoral student at the UA, said programs like Operation Streamline or lateral repatriation, in which people are dropped off at a different location from where they initially crossed, are not having the desired effect.\par \par \uc2 "The only thing it does is put people in harm's way," he said. "It separates groups and sends them to places like Tamaulipas and Coahuila, which are extremely dangerous."\par \par \uc2 Researchers also highlighted what they called "systematic abuses" by U.S. authorities.\par \par \uc2 About 10 percent of respondents said they had been physically abused by U.S. authorities, which researchers said is consistent with recent reports by groups such as No More Deaths and the Kino Border Initiative.\par \par \uc2 CBP did not respond to a request for comment, but in the past officials have said agents are required to treat all of those they encounter with respect and dignity, and to make every effort to make sure people in their custody are given the attention they need.\par \par \uc2 The issue deserves further attention because more than 400,000 people were deported to Mexico in 2011, Martinez said.\par \par \uc2 "Funds to the border should go towards oversight and accountability," he said.\par \par \uc2 Contact reporter Perla Trevizo at ptrevizo@azstarnet.com or at 573-4213.

That system is known as the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or more commonly, NICS.\par \par \uc2 The Arizona Criminal Justice Commission voted unanimously Thursday to support recommendations to bolster the state's NICS reporting, but only after adding a review of laws pertaining to local law enforcement's access to mental health records to the long list of the project consultants' to do's.\par \par \uc2 The vote by the group of statewide criminal justice officials was also conditioned on a clarification of how to ensure that felons who have had their Second Amendment rights restored at the state level can pass the federal background check.\par \par \uc2 But perhaps the most important caveat to the vote was that it did not involve the allocation of any money. Funds were not dedicated to the effort in Gov. \uc2 Jan Brewer\uc2 's state budget plan, a fact that threatened to topple the effort altogether.\par \par \uc2 Commission program manager Pat Nelson had earlier estimated the cost of implementing the recommendations at about $28 million, but board members clarified and re-clarified at Thursday's meeting that no cost breakdown had been made and no state funds had been promised.\par \par \uc2 "There is no money in this," said David Byers, the state's administrative director of the courts, by way of introducing the measures.\par \par \uc2 The burden of many of the recommended process changes falls to the courts.\par \par \uc2 The recommendations approved Thursday include:\par \par \uc2 * Establishing specific data stewardship guidelines to make each law enforcement agency responsible only for the charges it establishes or adjudicates.\par \par \uc2 * Modifying the state's disposition reporting system to show what phase of the process the charges are in.\par \par \uc2 * Creating scorecards that would reflect how well counties are updating their records with outcomes.\par \par \uc2 * Improving the database systems used for protective orders, mental health records and warrants.\par \par \uc2 * Providing technical assistance for systems upgrades.\par \par \uc2 Among the acknowledged holes in records reporting that have not so far received much scrutiny is how to include negative drug-test records.\par \par \uc2 Under federal rules, a person is not eligible to own a gun if they have failed a drug test in the past year or have been arrested within the last year on a drug charge or multiple times in the past five years on drug charges.\par \par \uc2 "It is our understanding now that Jared Lee Loughner failed a drug test when he was trying to enter the military," said project consultant Anthony Coulson, referring to the gunman in the Jan. 8, 2011, mass shooting in Tucson. "He technically would have been a prohibited possessor."\par \par \uc2 Arizona currently reports only a portion of the mental health records required. It sends records related to people who are involuntarily committed for mental health reasons, but not those found by a judge to be an "incapacitated person" or "not competent" for mental health reasons.\par \par \uc2 Coulson estimates that only about one-tenth of Arizona's relevant mental health records are entered into the federal repository.\par \par \uc2 The next step, he said, is to create action plans for each of the recommendations.\par \par \uc2 The project has so far received about $1.5 million in federal funding, Nelson said.

In-state rates are much lower than those for out-of- state residents.\par \par \uc2 At the UA, for example, in-state tuition is about $10,000 a year for basic full-time tuition and mandatory fees, compared with more than $26,000 for nonresidents.\par \par \uc2 The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, announced by the White House in June, aims to help those brought into the U.S. illegally before age 16. Candidates also must be in school or have a high school diploma or GED, have no felony convictions and meet several other requirements.\par \par \uc2 When the new federal program began, Arizona Gov. \uc2 Jan Brewer\uc2  issued an executive order declaring that the young people it covers are still in the country illegally and should not receive driver's licenses or "any taxpayer-funded public benefits." A number of other Arizona laws also prevent tuition discounts and other benefits for illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 But in January, the Department of Homeland Security announced on a federal website that those covered by the new program "are considered to be lawfully present" in the country.\par \par \uc2 While community colleges have lowered tuition for such students, the Board of Regents has taken a hands-off approach until now. Its lawyers have interpreted state laws on tuition differently from legal advisers for colleges.\par \par \uc2 Matthew Benson, a spokesman for the Arizona governor, said Brewer won't comment until the regents actually propose a change and details are available.\par \par \uc2 Immigrant advocates say Pima County is home to as many as 4,000 \uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2  students, though it isn't clear how many qualify for the new federal program.\par \par \uc2 Contact reporter Carol Ann Alaimo at calaimo@azstarnet.com or at 573-4138.\par \par \uc2 Document TUCS000020130615e9380004n\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 NEWS\par {\*\bkmkstart toc69}{\*\bkmkend toc69}\b \uc2 PCC slashes tuition for some immigrants\b0\par\par\uc2 CAROL ANN ALAIMO   \par \uc2 CAROL ANN ALAIMO, ARIZONA DAILY STAR\par \uc2 658 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 February 2013\par \uc2 The Arizona Daily Star\par \uc2 TUCS\par \uc2 FINAL\par A1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2013 The Arizona Daily Star.

It is expected to take effect in time for the fall semester.\par \par \uc2 The higher rate is what nonresidents of Arizona must pay to attend PCC. Until now, the college also has charged \uc2 illegal- immigrant\uc2  students at the higher rate, even if they've lived in the state for years.\par \par \uc2 That left many unable to pursue a college degree on a full-time basis, if at all - no matter how well they had done in high school.\par \par \uc2 "This will change my life," said a beaming Ana Rodriguez, 20, after the vote witnessed by 150 or so people who packed the meeting.\par \par \uc2 Rodriguez, who came to Tucson from Nogales, Sonora, as an 8-year- old, told a story similar to many heard by PCC's board.\par \par \uc2 She graduated from Amphitheater High School in 2011 with a 4.3 grade-point average - equivalent to an A-plus - and was offered about $10,000 in scholarships to attend PCC full-time for two years. She couldn't accept because she lacked a Social Security number, she said.\par \par \uc2 Until now, part-time classes were all her family could afford, and at that rate, it would have taken five years to graduate from a two-year program. Many young illegal immigrants in that situation end up dropping out in frustration, she said.\par \par \uc2 Local educators were among those who urged the college's board to adopt the change.\par \par \uc2 "I truly believe this is a defining moment for our community," said Manuel Isquierdo, superintendent of the Sunnyside Unified School District.\par \par \uc2 He predicted lower drop-out rates and higher academic achievement in his district if college becomes more affordable for immigrant children.\par \par \uc2 Saul Ostroff, a career counselor for Pueblo Magnet High School in the Tucson Unified School District, said the whole county would benefit economically from having more educated workers paying higher taxes.\par \par \uc2 Wednesday's vote makes PCC the second community college district in Arizona to offer in-state tuition to young illegal immigrants covered by a federal program that offers them work permits and renewable, two-year reprieves from deportation.\par \par \uc2 Maricopa County's 10-college system was the first to adopt the approach. The state's three public universities, including the \uc2 University of Arizona\uc2 , are interpreting the law differently and do not give tuition discounts to such students.\par \par \uc2 The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, announced by the White House in June, aims to help those who entered the country before age 16.

Board member Scott Stewart, who cast the lone vote against the measure, said PCC should seek more information about the potential impact before agreeing to the move.\par \par \uc2 Contact reporter Carol Ann Alaimo at calaimo@azstarnet.com or at 573-4138.\par \par \uc2 On StarNet: Find extensive coverage of immigration issues at azstarnet.com/border\par \par \uc2 "I truly believe this is a defining moment for our community."\par \par \uc2 Manuel Isquierdo, superintendent of the Sunnyside Unified School District\par \par \uc2 Document TUCS000020130613e92s00013\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 NEWS\par {\*\bkmkstart toc70}{\*\bkmkend toc70}\b \uc2 Discoveries of crossers' bodies now at lowest level in 10 years\b0\par\par\uc2 PERLA TREVIZO   \par \uc2 PERLA TREVIZO, ARIZONA DAILY STAR\par \uc2 765 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 February 2013\par \uc2 The Arizona Daily Star\par \uc2 TUCS\par \uc2 FINAL\par A1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2013 The Arizona Daily Star.

Los candidatos tambien deben estar matriculados en una escuela o tener un diploma de preparatoria o un GED, y no haber sido condenados por un delito mayor, entre otros requisitos.\par \par \uc2 Los que hayan sido aprobados para el programa pueden recibir un perdon de deportacion de dos anos renovable, y son elegibles ademas para un permiso federal de trabajo.\par \par \uc2 La propuesta para cambiar la matricula del PCC esta siendo impulsada por Sylvia Lee, una nueva integrante de la Mesa Directiva quien apoya mas flexibilidad en las leyes de inmigracion.\par \par \uc2 "Yo veo esto como un asunto de desarrollo economico y de calidad de vida", dijo Lee en una entrevista. "Entre mas eduquemos a un individuo, mejor para todos nosotros y nuestra economia".\par \par \uc2 Por lo menos una docena de estados proporcionan descuentos en matriculas con solo mostrar prueba de residencia, sin importar el estatus migratorio, dijo Matt Matera, director de Scholarships-A-Z, una organizacion sin fines de lucro de Tucson que ayuda a personas en busca de una educacion superior.\par \par \uc2 El estima que hay hasta cuatro mil estudiantes indocumentados que viven en el Condado Pima, aunque no esta claro cuantos califican para el nuevo programa federal.\par \par \uc2 Las opiniones legales contradictorias del estado han derivado en las diversas politicas de matriculas que tiene Arizona.\par \par \uc2 Por ejemplo, el Consejo de Regentes de Arizona (\uc2 Arizona Board of Regents\uc2 ), el cual supervisa las universidades publicas, interpreta que como los inmigrantes indocumentados bajo el nuevo programa federal aun no tienen un "estatus migratorio legal", no son elegibles para el descuento en la inscripcion.\par \par \uc2 Casi todos los colegios comunitarios han seguido lo que dicen los regentes, excepto por el sistema de colegios de Maricopa, que es el mas grande en el estado.\par \par \uc2 Las autoridades de Maricopa dicen que la ley estatal claramente permite el descuento en matricula para estudiantes con permiso de trabajo que comprueben que hayan vivido en Arizona por lo menos un ano.\par \par \uc2 Si el PCC adopta la politica de Maricopa, algunos temen una represalia financiera por parte de los legisladores estatales que estan opuestos a la ayuda publica para los inmigrantes indocumentados. El PCC recibe unos 7 millones de dolares de ayuda estatal al ano.\par \par \uc2 Scott Stewart, miembro de la Mesa Directiva del PCC, dijo en un junta reciente que le preocupa que "la Legislatura actual les de un contragolpe" que podria causar mas recortes a los fondos.\par \par \uc2 "Ese riesgo existe, absolutamente", aunque no es probable que ocurra, le contesto Michael Racy, el cabildero del PCC en la Legislatura, quien tambien estaba en la junta.\par \par \uc2 "Aunque definitivamente habra algunos (legisladores estatales) que tendran ese punto de vista, no creo que vaya a ser el punto de vista predominante", dijo Racy.\par \par \uc2 La Mesa Directiva del PCC considerara el asunto en la reunion del 27 de febrero.\par \par \uc2 Contacta a Carol Ann Alaimo en calaimo@azstarnet.com o al 573- 4138.\par \par \uc2 Following in the footsteps of its counterpart to the north, Pima Community College may soon make education much more affordable for some illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Those who entered the United States illegally as children and now are spared deportation under a new federal immigration program are getting steep in-state tuition discounts at 10 community colleges in the Phoenix area.\par \par \uc2 Locally, there are no such bargains at PCC, which classifies such students as nonresidents for tuition purposes even if they've lived in Arizona for years.\par \par \uc2 That could change this month when PCC's Governing Board will consider giving the same tuition breaks as Maricopa County's college system to students issued federal work permits under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program announced by the White House in June.\par \par \uc2 The move would mean big savings for such students, because nonresidents pay much higher tuition than in-state students.\par \par \uc2 PCC charges $63.50 per credit-hour to full-time students who live in state and $319 to those who don't.\par \par \uc2 The new federal program is open to illegal immigrants who entered the country before age 16 and were no older than 31 when the program began.

They couldn't do a follow-up check, even if they wanted to.\par \par \uc2 The wrinkle in records reporting is one of many that is complicating efforts to keep guns out of the hands of those banned from owning them.\par \par \uc2 That gap in the system and scores of others like it were highlighted Thursday when a statewide group of law enforcement agencies agreed on a set of recommended fixes ranging from short- term training measures to a long-term data stewardship overhaul.\par \par \uc2 The recommendations - while yet without funding - cemented Arizona's place as one of few states actively working to plug reporting holes.\par \par \uc2 Recent studies from the Arizona Criminal Justice Commission show that state reporting to the federal databases used in firearm background checks, which only affects weapons sold by licensed dealers, is badly in need of reform.\par \par \uc2 Many records that are supposed to be included never make it into the federal repositories maintained by the \uc2 Federal Bureau of Investigation\uc2 . Some records that should be cleared remain in place.\par \par \uc2 Commission figures show that only about two-thirds of the more than 470,000 arrests entered into the Arizona Computerized Criminal History database in 2009 were complete with information about dispositions by the end of the next year.\par \par \uc2 Many convictions aren't entered into the database because they can't be matched with an arrest record or fingerprints, and that repository feeds into a federal one, the Interstate Identification Index.\par \par \uc2 The other two databases the \uc2 FBI\uc2  searches when it does a check for a gun dealer - the National Crime Information Center and the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS among other things - have similar problems.\par \par \uc2 Different jurisdictions collect, process and report information differently, and sometimes quirks in the compatibility of state and federal databases lead to records being dropped in transfer.\par \par \uc2 With only about 3,300 mental health adjudications reported a year, the state is reporting an estimated one-tenth of the records it should be sending into federal repositories, said Anthony Coulson, the consultant on the project and former head of the \uc2 Drug Enforcement Administration\uc2 's Tucson office.\par \par \uc2 Arizona does not even report in one category required to funnel into NICS, which tracks mental health adjudications. Right now, no information about active indictments or charges being reviewed by a judge is flowing into the federal system.\par \par \uc2 Law enforcement experts consider background checks an important piece of gun regulation, but many sales don't require one. Gun sales that take place between private individuals or at gun shows and flea markets are exempted, as are sales to people who already have a concealed weapons permit.\par \par \uc2 About 40 percent of gun sales fall into that category, according to the most recent data from the \uc2 National Institute of Justice\uc2 . The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, one of the nation's leading gun-control groups, has said its top priority is to close loopholes that exempt gun-show sales from the background check requirement.\par \par \uc2 Still, Arizona criminal justice experts found it worthwhile to improve the state's reporting.\par \par \uc2 About 40 people representing courts, prosecutor's offices and front-line law enforcement volunteered to serve on the NICS task force.\par \par \uc2 The project is coordinated by the Arizona Criminal Justice Commission, a group created by the Legislature to coordinate criminal justice efforts among state, county and municipal agencies.\par \par \uc2 Among the nearly 30 recommendations approved Thursday were efforts to standardize fingerprinting procedures and distribute fingerprinting equipment to courthouses to ensure that cases are opened in the state's criminal history database.\par \par \uc2 Felony convictions that can't be linked back to a set of fingerprints aren't entered into the NICS system.\par \par \uc2 "That could be literally tens of thousands of people in Arizona who could walk in and buy a handgun because they're not in the system," Coulson said.\par \par \uc2 The recommendations would also add findings of "not competent" and "not restorable" and court orders of dismissal based on a finding that a person was not competent to assist in their defense to the mental health adjudications that flow into the federal system.\par \par \uc2 None of the recent mass shootings would have been prevented even if these recommended improvements of mental health reporting into the NICS system had been in place. The shooters' mental health histories did not include records that are required to be reported.\par \par \uc2 Even so, participants say the Jan. 8 shooting helped propel Arizona to move forward with recommendations.\par \par \uc2 The estimated cost of implementing the recommendations is about $28 million, program manager Pat Nelson said. The group hopes to get at least some of that from the Legislature this session. It has also applied for federal grants.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, background checks in Arizona hit an all-time high.\par \par \uc2 Firearms dealers requested nearly 49,000 checks in December, far more than the previous record of 34,000, which was set the month before, \uc2 FBI\uc2  data show. The December figure was 65 percent higher than the same month last year.\par \par \uc2 Tommy Rompel of Black Weapons Armory cited fears of gun-control legislation because of President Obama's re-election and the Newtown mass shooting as the motivation for heightened gun sales, along with a traditional boost in holiday sales.\par \par \uc2 Dec. 19 was a record-breaking day that topped the store's previous record, set on Black Friday, he said.\par \par \uc2 "We've seen a huge increase in demand and sales," Rompel said.

Ron Barber, a Democrat from Tucson, along with U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, asked the GAO to review how the Border Patrol manages its resources on the Southwest border.\par \par \uc2 "To ensure the border is secure, we must define our goals and deploy resources where they are needed most," Barber said in a news release. "I call upon the Border Patrol and the Department of Homeland Security to develop smarter strategies and tactics and a better way to measure border security."\par \par \uc2 He plans two public meetings on the report later this month in Douglas and Tucson.\par \par \uc2 Officials with \uc2 U.S. Customs and Border Protection\uc2 , which includes the Border Patrol, could not be reached for comment, but Department of Homeland Security officials said in the report that it agreed with the recommendations and it would come up with specifics by November.\par \par \uc2 Barber said Border Patrol agents are doing an "exemplary job," but "if you can't measure progress, you can't talk about progress."\par \par \uc2 In fiscal year 2011, 18,500 agents apprehended more than 327,000 illegal immigrants and made more than 17,150 drug seizures along the Southwest border, including the Tucson Sector.\par \par \uc2 The Tucson Sector, which covers all of the Arizona border with Mexico except for the Yuma area, includes 13 percent of the U.S.- Mexico border but accounts for about 38 percent of all drug seizures and 37 percent of all apprehensions across the entire Southwest border.\par \par \uc2 But border apprehensions in the Tucson Sector, as in all the Southwest, have been decreasing. From fiscal 2006 to 2011, they declined by 68 percent in the Tucson Sector. The GAO attributed those declines not only to enhanced efforts by the Border Patrol but also to the downturn in the U.S. economy.\par \par \uc2 Over the last several years the Border Patrol has received funding that has helped it increase the number of agents and increase the use of technology to thwart smugglers.\par \par \uc2 Customs and Border Protection spent more than $4 billion to secure the U.S. border with Mexico in fiscal 2011, according to the report. From fiscal 2004 to 2011, the number of Border Patrol agents on the Southwest border nearly doubled from 9,500 to 18,500.\par \par \uc2 While progress is being made, Barber thinks there's still room for improvement.\par \par \uc2 "When I speak to the ranchers who live east of Douglas and they tell me drug flow and \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  flow has not changed significantly, why aren't we putting resources in those areas?" Barber asked.\par \par \uc2 GAO officials talked with 13 ranchers in the Tucson Sector who said the number of illegal immigrants coming across their properties had declined but the level of drug smuggling had remained constant. They were also concerned that illegal trafficking had affected land values and driven up costs in the ranching industry.\par \par \uc2 The biggest concern for ranchers is drug trafficking because of the weapons used by smugglers, said Ray Borane, former mayor of Douglas.\par \par \uc2 The U.S. economy, coupled with enforcement and anti-illegal- immigration laws like Arizona's SB 1070, have helped bring the number of illegal crossers down, he said, but hasn't affected drug trafficking in the same way. "I don't know that there's more, but it's constant because there's a much greater monetary demand than for workers," he said.\par \par \uc2 Barber said he would like to see more resources shifted to the Tucson area.\par \par \uc2 More resources are needed, said Art Del Cueto, president of the National Border Patrol Council's union local in Tucson, adding that the agents in the field are the ones who need to be asked what they should be.\par \par \uc2 "If I'm going to find out how to bake a cake, I'm going to ask the cook of the restaurant, not the owner of the building. And I think that's the issue," he said.\par \par \uc2 Contact reporter Perla Trevizo at ptrevizo@azstarnet.com or at 573-4213.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Impera la opacidad en asesinatos a manos de la Patrulla Fronteriza\par \par \uc2 Apenas dos meses despues de que un agente de la Patrulla Fronteriza le hubiera disparado al hijo de 16 anos de Araceli Rodriguez Salazar en Nogales, Sonora, la madre comenzo a notar que el silencio invade este caso.\par \par \uc2 "Estoy cansada de llorar. Estoy cansada de esperar. Quiero que se haga justicia", dijo en una tarde reciente, al frente de su humilde hogar en la ladera de una colina en el centro de la ciudad.\par \par \uc2 Si el mismo patron se mantiene, tendra que esperar mucho mas.\par \par \uc2 Una investigacion de la Estrella de Tucson y el Arizona Daily Star ha revelado que aunque los disparos por parte de los agentes hayan estado incrementando, el sistema para la rendicion de cuentas continua siendo complicado y opaco, dejando a los ciudadanos sin informacion sobre el estatus de los casos. \uc2 Un\uc2  caso de Arizona ha sido secreto y ha estado "en curso" por casi tres anos.\par \par \uc2 Las preguntas se han agudizado, ya que en Arizona por lo menos en dos ocasiones en los ultimos dos anos agentes les dispararon a personas que aparentemente no los estaban amenazando.\par \par \uc2 En las pocas ocasiones en que se ha procesado a agentes en Arizona, los oficiales han ganado. Quiza los disparos estaban justificados, pero el secretismo del proceso provoca que tal vez la gente nunca lo sepa.\par \par \uc2 A medida que aumentan las preguntas, los disparos de los agentes de la Patrulla Fronteriza continuan incrementandose - principalmente en Arizona. En los ultimos tres anos, los agentes les han disparado por lo menos a 22 personas a nivel nacional. Nueve de esos casos han sucedido en el Sur de Arizona -cuatro en los ultimos dos meses y dos de ellos en tan solo la ultima semana.\par \par \uc2 El 2 de diciembre, un agente de la Patrulla Fronteriza mato a un presunto inmigrante indocumentado en las montanas Baboquivari. La agencia dijo que el guatemalteco Margarito Lopez Morelos, quien tenia 19 anos, lucho con el agente.\par \par \uc2 Dos dias despues, el 4 de diciembre, un agente al suroeste de Gila Bend hirio a un hombre quien, segun la agencia, blandio un arma.\par \par \uc2 Desde enero del 2010 han habido por lo menos seis balaceras transfronterizas con agentes, incluyendo el tiroteo en el que murio el hijo de Rodriguez-Salazar, Jose Antonio Elena Rodriguez. Cuando murio, el estaba en la acera al otro lado de la calle que corre a lo largo de la frontera, y que mide 36 pies de ancho.\par \par \uc2 Dos personas estaban en la cerca fronteriza cuando los agentes llegaron mas o menos a las 11 p.m. Alguien comenzo a tirar piedras, aunque los reportes de la policia no aclaran quien fue, y por lo menos un agente disparo hacia Mexico.\par \par \uc2 Los disparos le dieron a Elena Rodriguez por lo menos siete veces - dos veces en la cabeza y cinco veces en la espalda. Los muros detras de el quedaron salpicados con balazos.\par \par \uc2 "?Que pasaria si un policia de Sonora hubiera disparado y le hubiera dado a un joven de 16 anos que estuviera caminado en la calle en Arizona?", pregunto Kat Rodriguez, de la Coalicion de Derechos Humanos, un grupo en Tucson que aboga por esta causa. "Todos sabemos que la reaccion seria muy distinta, y no deberia de ser asi".\par \par \uc2 Los agentes de la Patrulla Fronteriza estan entrenados para utilizar fuerza letal solo cuando ellos o alguien mas este corriendo peligro mortal, dijo Bill Brooks, un vocero de la agencia. Sin embargo, los oficiales siempre deben dispararle solamente a la persona amenazante, dijo Dave Klinger, profesor adjunto de Criminalistica en la Universidad de Missouri-St. Louis.\par \par \uc2 "Si tengo a un tipo que me esta disparando, no tengo el derecho de simplemente disparar en esa direccion en general", explico Klinger, quien dijo haber matado a un hombre cuando era policia en Los Angeles.\par \par \uc2 Lo mismo ocurre cuando se tiran piedras, anadio Klinger, junto con otros. Entre mas cerca este la persona tirando piedras, mas probabilidades hay de que sea una amenaza inminente.\par \par \uc2 El 21 de marzo del 2011, en Douglas, un agente mato a Carlos LaMadrid, quien tenia 19 anos. La policia local persiguio a LaMadrid hasta la cerca fronteriza, donde un vehiculo de la Patrulla Fronteriza choco con el que LaMadrid estaba manejando, segun los reportes del sheriff del Condado Cochise.\par \par \uc2 LaMadrid y uno de los pasajeros comenzaron a subirse por una escalera que sus amigos habian puesto contra la cerca, y al mismo tiempo alguien montado en la cerca comenzo a tirarle piedras a los agentes. El agente les disparo y mato a LaMadrid mientras se subia por la escalera. Los que estaban tirando piedras se escaparon hacia Mexico.\par \par \uc2 El procurador del Condado Cochise, Ed Rheinheimer, dijo que ya ha decidido si va a procesar al agente en el caso de LaMadrid, pero esta esperando a que las autoridades federales tomen una decision tambien, para no influenciarlas.\par \par \uc2 El FBI, el inspector general del Departamento de Seguridad Nacional de Estados Unidos, el equipo de incidentes criticos de la Patrulla Fronteriza y la rama de Asuntos Internos de Proteccion Fronteriza, todos pueden responder a cualquier balacera de un agente de la Patrulla Fronteriza.\par \par \uc2 La Oficina del Fiscal de Estados Unidos supervisa la investigacion, y las agencias policiacas locales tambien pueden investigar si se violaron leyes estatales. En el caso de Elena Rodriguez, la policia estatal de Sonora respondio al otro lado de la frontera.\par \par \uc2 Lento y opaco\par \par \uc2 Pero, ?quien esta a cargo y que pasa despues? Esta pregunta es mas dificil.\par \par \uc2 Ni siquiera Jim Calle, un abogado de Tucson cuyo trabajo es defender a los agentes de la Patrulla Fronteriza involucrados en balaceras o acusados de mala conducta, puede determinar con precision el proceso.\par \par \uc2 "He estado haciendo esto por mas de una decada y todavia es confuso para mi", dijo Calle. "Asi es como opera el gobierno federal. Todo es lento. Todo es opaco (y las investigaciones) son siempre muy dificiles".\par \par \uc2 "Olvidate del proceso. Hay veces que el publico ni se entera de que hubo una balacera", agrego.\par \par \uc2 A los familiares de los que mueren se les hace dificil creer que los casos se investigan bien, porque no lo ven. Una de las familias que esta atascada en el proceso es la de Ramses Barron Torres, quien murio al otro lado de la cerca fronteriza en Nogales, Sonora, baleado por un agente de la Patrulla Fronteriza el 5 de enero del 2011.\par \par \uc2 Un\uc2  vocero del \uc2 FBI\uc2  dijo en ese entonces que los agentes de la Patrulla Fronteriza estaban tratando de arrestar a narcotraficantes cuando unas personas les empezaron a tirar piedras. La policia de Sonora dijo que Barron Torres se estaba subiendo en el lado Sur de la cerca cuando se le disparo. No esta claro si el estaba tirando piedras.\par \par \uc2 Ahora, 23 meses despues, el \uc2 FBI\uc2  dice que la investigacion todavia esta en marcha.\par \par \uc2 Hay otro caso que ha estado abierto aun mas tiempo. Jorge Solis Palma fue baleado el 4 de enero del 2010 despues de que, segun agentes, el les tirara piedras. La Oficina del Procurador del Condado Pima absolvio al agente dos meses despues, pero el \uc2 FBI\uc2  aun esta considerando el caso, casi tres anos despues.\par \par \uc2 En los dias siguientes a la muerte de Barron Torres, "vinieron periodistas de aqui, periodistas de alla", comento su madre Zelma. "Despues de unos dias, se desaparecieron. Hasta la fecha, no se nada".\par \par \uc2 Cuando un policia de Tucson o un colaborador del sheriff del Condado Pima mata a alguien, el proceso por lo general es transparente y tipicamente rapido. Ambas agencias se autorresponsabilizan de informar al publico sobre el incidente de forma expedita e incluyen el nombre del oficial.\par \par \uc2 Sin embargo, la Patrulla Fronteriza no revela los nombres de los agentes involucrados en las balaceras. La familia LaMadrid tuvo que obtener una orden judicial para forzar al gobierno federal a revelar el nombre del agente que le disparo al joven, para que se le pudieran despachar documentos legales.\par \par \uc2 Los agentes del \uc2 FBI\uc2  deben de ser imparciales en los casos de balaceras de la Patrulla Fronteriza. Pero la manera en que algunos casos han procedido ha causado que algunos testigos entren en duda.\par \par \uc2 El 7 de junio del 2010, unos agentes de la Patrulla Fronteriza en San Diego mataron a Anastasio Hernandez-Rojas mientras lo expulsaban del pais a Tijuana. En un comunicado de prensa, los agentes policiales de San Diego dijeron que le habian quitado las esposas a Hernandez-Rojas y que se puso violento, por lo cual un agente utilizo un arma de electrochoque.\par \par \uc2 Pero los testigos y unas grabaciones de video del incidente muestran que las manos de Hernandez-Rojas estaban sujetadas detras de su espala. Se encontraba tendido en el piso, gritando y pidiendo ayuda, rodeado por una docena de agentes mientras le daban choques electricos, y murio.\par \par \uc2 Un\uc2  poco mas reciente, el residente de Nogales, Arizona, que llamo al 911 y que desato la cadena de eventos que resultaron en la muerte de Jose Antonio Elena Rodriguez al otro lado de la frontera, dijo que nadie lo ha llegado a entrevistar. Marco Gonzalez, un locutor de radio que vive en la frontera, llamo al 911 el 10 de octubre por la noche para informarle a la policia que unas personas se habian cruzado la cerca fronteriza y estaban en su patio y en una calle vecina. \uc2 Un\uc2  poco despues, vio que unos agentes de la Patrulla pasaron en sus vehiculos y luego escucho los disparos. Ni la policia de Nogales, ni la Patrulla Fronteriza, ni el \uc2 FBI\uc2  lo contactaron.\par \par \uc2 Es poco probable que un agente que le dispare a alguien sea procesado o disciplinado internamente.\par \par \uc2 La Patrulla Fronteriza se rehuso a comentar si los agentes en los seis casos de balaceras recientes del sur de Arizona habian sido reprendidos.\par \par \uc2 "Las acciones administrativas y disciplinarias de nuestros empleados no se hacen publicas", dijo el vocero Brooks en un correo electronico.\par \par \uc2 Los agentes se benefician de la suposicion que existe de que actuaron correctamente, y el umbral de procesamiento es mas alto para ellos en comparacion al del resto de los ciudadanos.\par \par \uc2 "A los oficiales se les da el beneficio de la duda, no solamente por el jurado y los ciudadanos americanos sino tambien dentro de las oficinas del Fiscal de Distrito y el Fiscal de Estados Unidos", dijo Johnny Sutton, quien fue fiscal de Estados Unidos para el distrito Occidental de Texas del 2001 al 2009.\par \par \uc2 Como fiscal de Estados Unidos, Sutton declaro varias balaceras de agentes como justificadas, comento, pero su oficina tambien encarcelo a dos agentes de la Patrulla Fronteriza. En el 2005, los agentes Ignacio Ramos y Jose Compean le dispararon a un narcotraficante desarmado que estaba huyendo. Su procesamiento y sentencia causaron un reproche a nivel nacional hasta por personalidades de la television. El presidente Bush les redujo sus sentencias en su ultimo dia de gobierno.\par \par \uc2 Aparte del beneficio de la duda que se les da, es menos probable que sean acusados, en primer lugar por el simple hecho de que son oficiales. Es mas dificil ganar un caso contra un policia.\par \par \uc2 Rheinheimer, procurador del Condado Cochise, presento una demanda contra el agente de la Patrulla Fronteriza Nicholas Corbett en el 2008. Argumento que la muerte en el 2007 de un inmigrante indocumentado por el agente era injustificada y un crimen, y por lo tanto un homicidio de segundo grado.\par \par \uc2 Se realizaron dos juicios, en ambos el jurado quedo sin veredicto y finalmente Rheinheimer abandono el caso.\par \par \uc2 El sindicado de los agentes de la Patrulla Fronteriza critico a Rheinheimer por procesar al agente, y dijeron que "se dejo influenciar por el gobierno mexicano y por los grupos radicales con intereses especiales".\par \par \uc2 Isabel Garcia, una abogada y activista de los derechos civiles, le echo la culpa a la falsa idea que tiene el publico de que la frontera es una zona de guerra.\par \par \uc2 "Aun cuando se hace lo que se deberia -un procesamiento completo- , verdaderamente es dificil eliminar esa impunidad", comento. "El publico es muy ignorante. Cree todo lo feo, entonces, obviamente les dan a los agentes una inmunidad total".\par \par \uc2 Contacte a \uc2 Tim Steller\uc2  al 520 807-8427 o en tsteller@azstarnet.com\par \par \uc2 ENGLISH\par \par \uc2 Just two months after a Border Patrol agent shot her 16-year-old son in Nogales, Sonora, Araceli Rodriguez Salazar sensed silence spreading over the case.\par \par \uc2 "I'm tired of crying. I'm tired of waiting. I want justice," she said on a recent afternoon, standing outside her humble home on a downtown hillside.\par \par \uc2 If the pattern holds, she'll be waiting much longer.\par \par \uc2 Even as the number of shootings by agents increases, the system for holding them accountable remains complicated and opaque, leaving the public in the dark about the status of the cases, an Arizona Daily Star investigation has found. One Arizona case has remained secret and "ongoing" for almost three years.\par \par \uc2 Questions have sharpened after agents shot people who apparently weren't threatening them at least twice in Arizona over the last two years.\par \par \uc2 In the few cases when agents have been prosecuted in Arizona, they've won. That may be because the shootings were justified, but the secrecy of the process means the public may never know.\par \par \uc2 As questions of accountability grow louder, shootings by Border Patrol agents continue - primarily in Arizona. In the last three years agents have shot at least 22 people nationwide. Nine of those cases have been in Southern Arizona - four in the last two months and two just last week.\par \par \uc2 On Dec. 2, a Border Patrol agent in the Baboquivari Mountains killed an apparent \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  - 19-year-old Guatemalan Margarito Lopez Morelos - who, the agency said, struggled with an agent. Two days later, Dec. 4, an agent southwest of Gila Bend shot and wounded a man who, the agency said, brandished a weapon.\par \par \uc2 Since January 2010, there have been at least six cross-border shootings by agents, including the one that killed Rodriguez- Salazar's son, Jose Antonio Elena Rodriguez. When killed, he was on a sidewalk across the 36-foot-wide street along the border.\par \par \uc2 Two people were on the border fence when agents arrived at about 11 p.m. Rocks flew, though police reports leave it unclear who threw them, and at least one agent fired into Mexico.\par \par \uc2 Elena Rodriguez was hit at least seven times - twice in the head and five times in the back. The walls next to him were pocked with bullet holes.\par \par \uc2 "What would have happened if a Sonoran police officer had opened fire and shot a 16-year-old walking along the street in Arizona?" asked Kat Rodriguez of the Coalicion de Derechos Humanos, a human- rights advocacy group in Tucson. "We all know the response would be very different, and it shouldn't be."\par \par \uc2 Border Patrol agents are taught to use deadly force only when they or someone else are threatened with death, agency spokesman Bill Brooks said. However, officers everywhere must always have "target discrimination" and fire only at the person posing the threat, said Dave Klinger, an associate professor of criminal justice at the University of Missouri-St. Louis.\par \par \uc2 "If I've got a guy shooting at me, I don't get to send rounds downrange at the general area," said Klinger, who himself shot and killed a man when he was a Los Angeles police officer.\par \par \uc2 The same rules apply to rock-throwing, Klinger and others said. The closer the thrower, the more likely it poses an imminent threat.\par \par \uc2 On March 21, 2011, an agent shot and killed 19-year-old Carlos LaMadrid in Douglas. Local police had chased LaMadrid to the border fence, where a Border Patrol vehicle collided with the one LaMadrid was driving, Cochise County sheriff's reports show.\par \par \uc2 LaMadrid and a passenger began climbing a ladder friends had put against the fence, and at the same time someone atop the fence began throwing rocks at the agent. The agent fired and killed LaMadrid as he climbed the ladder. The rock throwers escaped into Mexico.\par \par \uc2 Cochise County Attorney Ed Rheinheimer said he has made a decision about whether to prosecute the agent in the LaMadrid case, but he is waiting until federal authorities make their call so as not to influence their decision.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 FBI\uc2 , Department of Homeland Security inspector general, the Border Patrol's critical incident team and the Customs and Border Protection Internal Affairs branch all may respond to any shooting by a Border Patrol agent.\par \par \uc2 The U.S. Attorney's Office oversees the investigation, and local police agencies may also investigate whether state laws were broken. In Elena Rodriguez's case, the Sonoran state police responded on their side of the border.\par \par \uc2 Who's in charge, and what happens from there? That's a tougher question.\par \par \uc2 Even Jim Calle, a Tucson attorney whose job is to defend Border Patrol agents involved in shootings or accused of misconduct, can't pinpoint the process.\par \par \uc2 "I've been doing this for more than a decade, and it's still confusing to me," Calle said. "That's how the federal government operates. They're slow. It's opaque, and they (the investigations) are always difficult."\par \par \uc2 "There are times when the public never learns about the shooting, never mind the process," he added.\par \par \uc2 The families of those killed and others find it hard to believe the cases are well-investigated because they can't see it. One of the families stuck in the process is that of Ramses Barron Torres, killed on the Mexican side of the border fence in Nogales, Sonora, by a Border Patrol agent on Jan. 5, 2011.\par \par \uc2 An FBI spokesman said at the time that Border Patrol agents were trying to arrest drug smugglers when people started throwing rocks at them. Sonoran police said Barron Torres was climbing on the south side of the border fence when shot. It's unclear whether he was a rock thrower.\par \par \uc2 Now, 23 months later, he \uc2 FBI\uc2  says the investigation is ongoing.\par \par \uc2 Another case has been open even longer: Jorge Solis Palma was shot on Jan. 4, 2010, after, agents said, he threw rocks at them. The Cochise County Attorney's Office cleared the agent two months later, but the \uc2 FBI\uc2  still considers it "an ongoing matter" almost three years later.\par \par \uc2 In the days after Barron Torres was shot, "there were reporters from here, reporters from over there," his mother, Zelma, said in Spanish. "After a few days, they disappeared. Up till now, I don't know anything."\par \par \uc2 When a Tucson police officer or a Pima County sheriff's deputy shoots and kills somebody, the process is mostly transparent and typically quick.\par \par \uc2 Both agencies make it a rule to inform the public of the incident quickly and include the officer's name. The Border Patrol keeps the names of agents involved in shootings secret. The LaMadrid had to obtain a court order to force the federal government to reveal the name of the agent who shot the boy so they could serve him with legal papers.\par \par \uc2 FBI\uc2  agents enter Border Patrol shooting cases impartially. But the way some cases proceeded left witnesses with doubt.\par \par \uc2 On June 7, 2010, Border Patrol agents in San Diego killed Anastasio Hernandez-Rojas as they were expelling him from the country into Tijuana. In a press release, San Diego police said agents had uncuffed Hernandez-Rojas and he became violent, causing an agent to use a taser to subdue him.\par \par \uc2 But witnesses say, and video recordings of the incident show, Hernandez-Rojas's hands were restrained behind his back and he was lying on the ground, screaming for help, as about a dozen agents stood over him, when he was tased and died.\par \par \uc2 More recently, a Nogales, Ariz., resident whose 911 call started chain of events that led to the killing of Jose Antonio Elena Rodriguez across the border, said no one has interviewed him.\par \par \uc2 Marco Gonzalez, a radio announcer who lives along the border, called 911 the night of Oct. 10 to tell police that people had jumped the border fence and were moving through his yard and a neighboring street. Soon after, he saw border agents drive by, then heard gunshots.\par \par \uc2 Neither Nogales police nor Border Patrol agents nor the \uc2 FBI\uc2  contacted him.\par \par \uc2 An agent who shoots somebody is unlikely to face prosecution or even internal discipline.\par \par \uc2 The Border Patrol declined to say whether the agents in any of the six recent Southern Arizona shooting cases were reprimanded. "Administrative and disciplinary actions of our employees are not made public," agency spokesman Brooks said in an email.\par \par \uc2 Agents enjoy an assumption that they're in the right, and they face a higher threshold for prosecution than the average citizen.\par \par \uc2 "Law enforcement officers are given the benefit of the doubt, not only by juries and American citizens, but inside DAs' and U.S. attorneys' offices," said Johnny Sutton, who was U.S. attorney for the western district of Texas from 2001 to 2009.\par \par \uc2 As U.S. attorney, Sutton ruled many shootings by agents justified and denied prosecution, he said, but his office also put two Border Patrol agents in prison. In 2005, agents Ignacio Ramos and Jose Compean shot an unarmed drug trafficker who was running away. Their conviction and sentencing prompted a nationwide outcry led by television personalities. President Bush commuted their sentences on his last day in office.\par \par \uc2 Beyond the benefit of the doubt officers receive, their jobs make them less likely to be charged in the first place. It's simply harder to win a case against a cop.\par \par \uc2 Cochise County Attorney Rheinheimer brought a second-degree murder case against Border Patrol Agent Nicholas Corbett in 2008, arguing Corbett's January 2007 killing of an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  was unjustified and a crime. There were two trials, two hung juries and finally Rheinheimer dropped the case.\par \par \uc2 The Border Patrol agents union lambasted Rheinheimer for prosecuting, saying "he let undue influence from the Mexican government and the radical special-interest groups taint his decision-making ability."\par \par \uc2 Longtime Tucson civil-rights activist Isabel Garcia, an attorney, laid the blame for the loss on the public's misconception of the border area as a war zone.\par \par \uc2 "Even when we get what we should get - full prosecution - it's really hard to break that impunity," she said. "The public is very ignorant. They believe all the ugly stuff, so of course they give the agents full immunity."\par \par \uc2 Contact reporter \uc2 Tim Steller\uc2  at 807-8427 or tsteller@azstarnet.com\par \par \uc2 Document TUCS000020130502e8cl0000c\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 NEWS\par {\*\bkmkstart toc76}{\*\bkmkend toc76}\b \uc2 Shootings and lawsuits go together\b0\par\par\uc2 TIM STELLER   \par \uc2 TIM STELLER, ARIZONA DAILY STAR\par \uc2 564 \uc2 words\par \uc2 9 December 2012\par \uc2 The Arizona Daily Star\par \uc2 TUCS\par \uc2 FINAL\par A19\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2012 The Arizona Daily Star.

Other times, the Mexican government offers the family legal help through a network of attorneys.\par \par \uc2 Among the survivors and their families now suing the federal government:\par \par \uc2 * The mother of Carlos LaMadrid, a U.S. citizen shot by a Border Patrol agent as he climbed a ladder over the border fence in Douglas on March 21, 2011.\par \par \uc2 * Jesus Enrique Castro-Romo, a Nogales, Sonora, resident who survived being shot by an agent on Nov. 16, 2010.\par \par \uc2 * The family of Sergio Hernandez-Guereca, killed along the international line in Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua, on June 7, 2010.\par \par \uc2 In that case, the U.S. government argued that constitutional protections don't apply to Hernandez-Guereca, a 15-year-old Mexican national because he was shot in Mexico. U.S. District Judge David Briones accepted that argument and dismissed the case in February. The family is appealing.\par \par \uc2 In the largest recent settlement, the federal government agreed to pay $850,000 to survivors of Mexican \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  Francisco Dominguez-Rivera. That's even though two juries failed to convict Border Patrol Agent Nicholas Corbett in Dominguez-Rivera's killing.\par \par \uc2 Frequently, however, the shooting victims' families get nothing.\par \par \uc2 Border Patrol Agent Denin Hermosillo killed an unarmed marijuana smuggler west of Rio Rico in 2005, in what investigators believed was an accidental discharge of Hermosillo's gun. The victim's father in Mexico sued in U.S. District Court, but the late Judge John Roll threw out the suit because it was filed too late.\par \par \uc2 Zelma Barron Torres, the mother of a 15-year-old killed near the border fence in Nogales, Sonora, in January 2011, received visits from several attorneys after the shooting. She signed a contract with one of them, Ezequiel Reyna Jr. of Weslaco, Texas.\par \par \uc2 But after a while, the lawyer stopped returning her calls, and eventually she had missed the deadline for filing suit. Reyna did not return a call from the Star seeking comment.\par \par \uc2 Attorney Luis Parra is representing the family of Jose Antonio Elena Rodriguez, a 16-year-old killed in Nogales, Sonora, by a Border Patrol agent firing across the border on Oct. 10. The agency said the gunfire was in response to rock throwing from the Mexican side.\par \par \uc2 "We're maintaining that Jose Antonio was not involved with rock throwers. He was not involved with crossing into the United States," Parra said.\par \par \uc2 The family plans to file a claim within the six months required by law, he said.\par \par \uc2 Suits can provide some accountability, said Esha Bhandari of the ACLU's Immigrant Rights Project.\par \par \uc2 She pointed to the Hernandez-Guereca case from El Paso as an example. Almost two years after the June 2010 shooting, in April this year, the Justice Department announced it would not pursue charges against the agent who shot him, despite witnesses and video evidence that raised questions about the necessity of the shooting.\par \par \uc2 "It's basically case closed," she said, "unless the Hernandez family gets their day in court."\par \par \uc2 Contact reporter Tim Steller at 807-8427 or tsteller@azstarnet.com\par \par \uc2 Document TUCS000020130407e8c900008\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 NEWS\par {\*\bkmkstart toc77}{\*\bkmkend toc77}\b \uc2 Border Patrol faces little accountability\b0\par\par\uc2 TIM STELLER   \par \uc2 TIM STELLER, ARIZONA DAILY STAR\par \uc2 2,587 \uc2 words\par \uc2 9 December 2012\par \uc2 The Arizona Daily Star\par \uc2 TUCS\par \uc2 FINAL\par A1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2012 The Arizona Daily Star.

The Border Patrol keeps the names of agents involved in shootings secret - to the point that LaMadrid's family got a court order to force the federal government to reveal the name of the agent who shot him so they could serve him with legal papers.\par \par \uc2 On the local level, two investigations of shootings occur.\par \par \uc2 In one, the local homicide department looks into whether the officer broke the law. Investigators pass their findings to the county attorney's office for a ruling on whether charges should be filed.\par \par \uc2 In the other investigation, internal affairs decides whether the officer followed department rules and regulations.\par \par \uc2 Those cases are typically wrapped up in two to six months, attorney Calle said.\par \par \uc2 The different ways the two levels of government respond is typical, said Klinger, the University of Missouri professor.\par \par \uc2 "The further away from the populace the seat of power is, the less accountability there is," he said. "For whatever reason, people haven't been making a big stink about federal use of deadly force."\par \par \uc2 In Border Patrol shooting cases, the investigation may be in an "ongoing" status long after FBI special agents have completed their work, said James Turgal, special agent in charge of the agency's Phoenix division. That may be because prosecutors from the county to the U.S. Attorney's Office to the Justice Department in Washington, D.C., are considering their options.\par \par \uc2 "Just because the \uc2 FBI\uc2  walks down to the U.S. Attorney's Office and presents a case, it doesn't mean we get an answer the next day," he said.\par \par \uc2 doubtful witnesses\par \par \uc2 FBI\uc2  agents enter Border Patrol shooting cases impartially, Turgal said. But the way some cases proceeded left witnesses with doubt.\par \par \uc2 On June 7, 2010, Border Patrol agents in San Diego killed Anastasio Hernandez-Rojas as they were expelling him from the country into Tijuana. In a press release, San Diego police said agents had uncuffed Hernandez-Rojas and he became violent, causing an agent to use a taser to subdue him.\par \par \uc2 But witnesses say, and video recordings of the incident show, Hernandez-Rojas's hands were restrained behind his back and he was lying on the ground, screaming for help, as about a dozen agents stood over him, when he was tased and died. The PBS program "Need to Know" revealed the videotapes and some witness accounts in two shows this year.\par \par \uc2 On June 7, 2010, a Border Patrol agent shot and killed 15-year- old Sergio Hernandez-Guereca in a concrete canal that separates Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua, from El Paso. In a news release, the \uc2 FBI\uc2  said the agent fired when a group "surrounded the agent and continued to throw rocks at him."\par \par \uc2 Witness accounts and videos show that the agent was not surrounded and that apparently no more than one person threw a rock at him. Nevertheless, the \uc2 FBI\uc2  labeled the incident as an "assault on a federal officer."\par \par \uc2 In some cases, the aftermath of the shootings does not inspire witnesses' confidence in investigators. In both the San Diego and El Paso cases, witnesses who were crossing border bridges when the shootings occurred said they were hustled away and not questioned.\par \par \uc2 One American woman who watched the agent shoot Hernandez-Guereca said in a deposition that she refused to leave the bridge despite a security guard shouting at her, and she spoke to investigators only after she insisted on calling 911 and later called the \uc2 FBI\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "No one approached me and said, 'Listen, can you tell us what happened?'" Bobbie James McDow said in a sworn deposition taken as part of a civil lawsuit. "It was basically, 'Get off the bridge, get off the bridge, get out of here.' "\par \par \uc2 More recently, a Nogales, Ariz., resident whose 911 call started chain of events that led to the killing of Jose Antonio Elena Rodriguez across the border, said no one has interviewed him.\par \par \uc2 Marco Gonzalez, a radio announcer who lives along the border, called 911 the night of Oct. 10 to tell police that people had jumped the border fence and were moving through his yard and a neighboring street. Soon after, he saw border agents drive by, then heard gunshots.\par \par \uc2 Neither Nogales police nor Border Patrol agents nor the \uc2 FBI\uc2  contacted him.\par \par \uc2 Sanctions unlikely\par \par \uc2 An agent who shoots somebody is unlikely to face prosecution or even internal discipline.\par \par \uc2 The Border Patrol declined to say whether the agents in any of the six recent Southern Arizona shooting cases were reprimanded. "Administrative and disciplinary actions of our employees are not made public," agency spokesman Brooks said in an email.\par \par \uc2 Calle, the Border Patrol union's lawyer, said in shootings it's "exceedingly rare that an agent faces disciplinary consequences for their conduct."\par \par \uc2 That's partly because most shootings are legally justified, agents and attorneys said. They argue there are more shootings now largely because more border jumpers resist arrest.\par \par \uc2 Also, they say, agents enjoy an assumption that they're in the right, and they face a higher threshold for prosecution than the average citizen.\par \par \uc2 "Law enforcement officers are given the benefit of the doubt, not only by juries and American citizens, but inside DAs' and U.S. attorneys' offices," said Johnny Sutton, who was U.S. attorney for the western district of Texas from 2001 to 2009. "You're always loath to prosecute a cop because you understand they're putting their lives on the line every day."\par \par \uc2 As U.S. attorney, Sutton ruled many shootings by agents justified and denied prosecution, he said, but his office also put two Border Patrol agents in prison. In 2005, agents Ignacio Ramos and Jose Compean shot an unarmed drug trafficker who was running away. Their conviction and sentencing prompted a nationwide outcry led by television personalities. President Bush commuted their sentences on his last day in office.\par \par \uc2 Beyond the benefit of the doubt officers receive, their jobs make them less likely to be charged in the first place. Prosecutors must consider the likelihood of winning a conviction when taking on a case, and it's simply harder to win a case against a cop.\par \par \uc2 Cochise County Attorney Rheinheimer brought a second-degree murder case against Border Patrol Agent Nicholas Corbett in 2008, arguing Corbett's January 2007 killing of an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  was unjustified and a crime. There were two trials, two hung juries and finally Rheinheimer dropped the case.\par \par \uc2 The Border Patrol agents union lambasted Rheinheimer for prosecuting, saying "he let undue influence from the Mexican government and the radical special-interest groups taint his decision-making ability."\par \par \uc2 Longtime Tucson civil-rights activist Isabel Garcia, an attorney, laid the blame for the loss on the public's misconception of the border area as a war zone.\par \par \uc2 "Even when we get what we should get - full prosecution - it's really hard to break that impunity," she said. "The public is very ignorant. They believe all the ugly stuff, so of course they give the agents full immunity."\par \par \uc2 If there's a next time, Rheinheimer said, he would factor in his failure to convict Corbett when deciding whether it's worth bringing charges against another agent.\par \par \uc2 That reality, he said, "is balanced against doing whatever is the right thing to do."\par \par \uc2 Contact reporter \uc2 Tim Steller\uc2  at 807-8427 or tsteller@azstarnet.com\par \par \uc2 On StarNet: Find extensive coverage of border-related issues at azstarnet.com/border\par \par \uc2 Continued from previous page\par \par \uc2 Continued on next0 page\par \par \uc2 the investigation continues inside\par \par \uc2 Shootings by agents\par \par \uc2 Map details 20 incidents in the past two years involving Border Patrol agents.

They were on foot in the hilly area when unknown gunmen opened fire.\par \par \uc2 Ivie, a 30-year-old father of two young girls, died of his wounds, another agent was wounded and the third agent was not hit. The wounded agent was in stable condition Tuesday after surgery at a Tucson hospital.\par \par \uc2 The agents were assigned to the Naco Border Patrol station, which was renamed in honor of slain agent Brian Terry just two weeks ago. Ivie's death put a new name on the dismaying list of victims of border violence.\par \par \uc2 "It just goes to show that whether you are an armed Border Patrol agent on duty or a simple rancher like Rob Krentz out working his ranch - if you're in border country you are in peril," said Rod Rothrock, acting sheriff of Cochise County.\par \par \uc2 Residents of the area midway between Naco and Douglas, about 100 miles southeast of Tucson, said the number of illegal immigrants has plummeted since 2008 when a fence across the border was completed and the economy tanked. The twist: Drug-smuggling traffic has remained about the same.\par \par \uc2 Indeed, the killing took place in an area that has been a drug- smuggling corridor for 30 to 40 years, said Lee Morgan II, who retired as a U.S. Customs Service special agent in 2006 after decades in the area.\par \par \uc2 "It's a historically bad area," said Morgan. "Over the years we've had numerous armed confrontations, shootings, pursuits."\par \par \uc2 Tripped sensors routine\par \par \uc2 The Border Patrol has buried sensors in many spots along border trails in Southern Arizona. Responding to a tripped sensor is a routine part of an agent's shift, said Art Del Cueto, president of the National Border Patrol Council local 2544 in Tucson.\par \par \uc2 Agents learn over time which sensors tend to signal \uc2 illegal- immigrant\uc2  groups, and which usually mean drug smugglers are moving through, Del Cueto said. But whenever they respond, they're in a heightened state of alertness.\par \par \uc2 The agents who responded early Tuesday radioed that they had come under fire from three or four people, Cochise County sheriff's Cmdr. Marc Denney told the Los Angeles Times. It is not known whether the agents returned fire, sheriff's spokeswoman Carol Capas told The Associated Press.\par \par \uc2 By the time deputies responded, the gunmen had disappeared, apparently on foot, Denney told the Times. "Whether they were picked up in another vehicle is unknown," he said. "They had a bit of a jump on us." Border agents were sent to try to cut off escape routes to Mexico.\par \par \uc2 Two suspects were detained by Mexican officials south of the border Tuesday, Denney told the L.A. Times. Rothrock, the acting sheriff, told the Star he had heard that but couldn't confirm it.\par \par \uc2 Rothrock's agency and the FBI are investigating the case jointly, but they declined to give any details of the shooting or investigation at a news conference Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 In Mexico, soldiers and federal and state police were sent to the area, but a spokesman for the Mexican military said no arrests were made, the Times reported.\par \par \uc2 President Obama called Ivie's family Tuesday to offer condolences and to express his gratitude for the agent's "selfless service to his nation," the White House said. Obama said the administration "was doing everything it could to locate those responsible."\par \par \uc2 "It's changed a lot" recently\par \par \uc2 Dan Oldfield's dogs started barking about 2 a.m. Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 Oldfield, 66, has lived on property along Arizona 80 for 25 years, just southeast of the Bisbee-Douglas highway in the southeastern foothills of the Mule Mountains.\par \par \uc2 "I got up and there were three cop cars with automatic weapons in my driveway," Oldfield said.\par \par \uc2 The officers told him an agent had been killed, and helicopters began circling the area, swooping over the house all night, he said.\par \par \uc2 The late-night action in the area has calmed in recent years as the groups of illegal border-crossers dwindled, he and other residents said. Much of the change happened after 2008, when the fence was completed between Naco and Douglas, said rancher Fred Giacoletti. Yet he and others said the drug-smuggling traffic has not gone down.\par \par \uc2 Ironically, the potential for trouble seems higher, said Tony Coulson, who retired as the agent in charge of the \uc2 Drug Enforcement Administration\uc2 's Tucson office in 2010. "The drug smuggling has been historically very aggressive in that area," Coulson said, adding: "The nature of trafficking has so changed, in the sense of the violence and the shooting."\par \par \uc2 Yet some residents feel quite safe compared to border agents, whose job puts them in harm's way. "It's actually pretty quiet down here," said Cynthia Binyon, who lives east of Naco.\par \par \uc2 A Dedicated dad and mormon\par \par \uc2 Ivie was a loving husband and father who cherished spending time with his daughters, ages 3 and 1, said Kevin Goates, president of the Sierra Vista stake of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Originally from Provo, Utah, Ivie served his Mormon mission in Mexico City and became a border agent assigned to the Naco station in January 2008.\par \par \uc2 He was a dedicated member of the Mormon church, serving as second counselor to the bishop of his local congregation. In that role, he conducted meetings and spoke to the congregation on Sundays.\par \par \uc2 Ivie loved taking the girls to the park and riding bikes with them, Goates said. "His family life was the center of everything that he did," Goates said.\par \par \uc2 On Monday evening, Ivie spoke with Dr. Jarrett Hamilton about the tithe Hamilton's young son had offered at the previous day's service. Ivie wanted to be sure the boy got proper credit for it, Hamilton said. And before starting his shift on Monday night, Ivie went to his wife's soccer practice, Goates said. While the mothers were practicing, Ivie rounded up all the kids and played with them.\par \par \uc2 "We believe that families are eternal," Goates said. "So, they have the hope of being able to be with Nick again. That gives them tremendous hope and comfort."\par \par \uc2 To contact reporters: Brady McCombs, 573-4213 or bmccombs@azstarnet.com; Tim Steller, 807-8427 or tsteller@azstarnet.com\par \par \uc2 On StarNet: See more photos at azstarnet.com/gallery\par \par \uc2 you can help\par \par \uc2 A foundation has been established to help the Ivie family pay for its expenses.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Longtime Cochise County Sheriff Larry Dever was killed Tuesday evening when his truck went off a road in Northern Arizona while on a family hunting trip. He was 60.\par \par \uc2 His death left his family, friends and colleagues shocked and saddened. And it ended Dever's 16-year run as the Republican sheriff of Cochise County - a period in which he rose to national prominence as an advocate for stronger border enforcement.\par \par \uc2 Dever's tenure coincided with Arizona becoming the busiest stretch of U.S.-Mexico border for illegal immigration and drug smuggling after a mid-1990s security push beefed up enforcement in Texas and California and funneled traffic to Arizona. Cochise County has 83.5 miles of Mexican border in Southeastern Arizona.\par \par \uc2 During his numerous appearances at congressional hearings and in his comments to the national media, Dever became known for having a measured response to the border issue. But he sharpened his tone in 2010 after his friend, rancher Robert Krentz, was killed on his land northeast of Douglas.\par \par \uc2 Dever blamed the killing on the unsecured border, deducing that it was probably carried out by a cross-border criminal. The crime has yet to be solved.\par \par \uc2 The Krentz killing triggered a wave of concern about border- related crime in Arizona and helped get Arizona's immigration enforcement law, SB 1070, passed by the Legislature and signed into law by Gov. \uc2 Jan Brewer\uc2 . Dever asked to legally defend the state's controversial law in federal court.\par \par \uc2 Dever also joined the chorus of Republicans slamming the Obama administration over a botched federal operation that lost track of weapons sold to suspect straw purchasers for Mexican drug gangs, known as "Fast and Furious."\par \par \uc2 His chief deputy, Rod Rothrock, takes over as interim sheriff and may also become his successor. (See box at right.)\par \par \uc2 No matter who replaces him, though, Dever's boots will remain forever unfilled, said Pima County Sheriff Clarence Dupnik, a Democrat who didn't always share the same opinions as Dever but respected him.\par \par \uc2 "He's going to be irreplaceable," Dupnik said. "He was an expert on border law-enforcement issues. He was always cooperative."\par \par \uc2 Santa Cruz County Sheriff Tony Estrada, also a Democrat, called Dever a friendly, professional and knowledgeable lawman. Both Dupnik and Estrada agreed that Dever's death leaves a major gap in the Southern Arizona law-enforcement community.\par \par \uc2 "We're going to miss him," Estrada said. "He's been a great ambassador for law enforcement and for the sheriffs of Arizona."\par \par \uc2 The accident\par \par \uc2 Dever died near Williams, west of Flagstaff, where he was on a family hunting trip.\par \par \uc2 He was driving a 2008 Chevrolet truck on a well-traveled dirt forest road about two miles north of White Horse Lake when the truck went off the road, said Gerry Blair, Coconino County Sheriff's Office spokesman.\par \par \uc2 Investigators don't know why, but Dever apparently lost control of the truck, going off the road and rolling at least once, coming to rest upright.\par \par \uc2 Dever, who was still in the truck when investigators arrived, was pronounced dead at the scene. They don't know yet if he was wearing a seat belt, Blair said.\par \par \uc2 There are no signs that he was drinking or impaired, he said. He was the only person in the truck.\par \par \uc2 He was on his way to meet several members of his family at a campsite, where they were set to go hunting, Blair said.\par \par \uc2 Dever is survived by his wife, Nancy, six sons and 11 grandchildren. The sheriff died just four days after his 86-year- old mother, Annie Mae Dever, died of cancer.\par \par \uc2 Cochise County lifer\par \par \uc2 Dever spent his entire life in Cochise County. He was born and raised in the town of St. David, southeast of Benson. In 1976, he began his career with the Cochise County Sheriff's Office as a deputy.\par \par \uc2 Dever was one of several sheriff's deputies wounded in an October 1982 clash at Miracle Valley, near Palominas. A radical church group from Chicago had taken up residence at the Hereford-area religious compound, and when deputies moved in to arrest some members, fighting and gunfire broke out.\par \par \uc2 Dever, then a sergeant, was hit by shotgun pellets and suffered minor wounds. In the aftermath, Dever was criticized for allegedly escalating the standoff, but he always defended his conduct.\par \par \uc2 During his first 20 years with the agency, Dever rose as high as chief deputy before retiring in early 1996 to run for sheriff. He changed his party affiliation - from Democrat to Republican - the year before to run against one-term incumbent John Pintek, a Democrat.\par \par \uc2 In an acrimonious campaign, Dever accused Pintek of wrongdoing, and Pintek said a win by Dever would represent the return of a good- old-boys network. Pintek had defeated Dever's cousin, Jimmy Judd, a four-term sheriff, in the 1992 Democratic primary. Dever defeated Pintek, the first of four victories.\par \par \uc2 Border sheriff\par \par \uc2 In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Dever became a proponent for more resources from the state and federal governments to combat the problems caused by crossings of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  and drug smugglers that had become a constant in the rural county.\par \par \uc2 In 2000, he called on then-Gov. Jane Hull to deploy the Arizona National Guard to provide more non-enforcement support.\par \par \uc2 "I have a responsibility to preserve the peace, and I'm trying to meet it. It is one of the greatest challenges I've faced in my life," Dever said in 2000.\par \par \uc2 Dever said his deputies were spending as much as 40 percent of their time on border crime in the early 2000s. The traffic continued throughout the decade, and a massive buildup of Border Patrol agents, fences and technology followed. Only recently has the flow of illegal immigration slowed.\par \par \uc2 In the aftermath of the Krentz slaying and Brewer's signing of SB 1070 into law, Dever supported placing National Guard troops on the border. He also openly called for using the moment of crisis to bring more resources to the border.\par \par \uc2 "While we have the nation's attention, it's important that we strike now and that we get these suggestions implemented now," Dever said in April 2010. "I really feel that the window of opportunity will close very quickly."\par \par \uc2 After the \uc2 American Civil Liberties Union\uc2  filed suit to stop the implementation of SB 1070, Dever and Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu joined forces in a group called the Border Sheriffs. The group was formed to raise money to defend SB 1070 against the ACLU lawsuit, which named the state's sheriffs and county attorneys as defendants.\par \par \uc2 His legacy\par \par \uc2 Residents are in shock about Dever's death, said Cochise County Attorney Ed Rheinheimer.\par \par \uc2 "When you hear about something like this, it's the kind of thing that makes you go weak in the knees," he said.\par \par \uc2 Dever will be remembered personally as a trustworthy man, and professionally as a sheriff who spoke up for border ranchers whose lands were being trampled by illegal crossers and drug smugglers, ranchers and colleagues said.\par \par \uc2 Cochise County Recorder Christine Rhodes, a Democrat originally from St. David, lauded Dever as a "wonderful family man."\par \par \uc2 "Larry Dever will be sorely missed. He was extremely well-liked, so well-liked that nobody was bothering to run against him," she said.\par \par \uc2 Dever's death is a huge loss to ranchers fighting the border issue, said Ed Ashurst, who manages a ranch in Cochise County.\par \par \uc2 "He wasn't afraid to speak out about it," Ashurst said. "He was a real patriotic American."\par \par \uc2 Contact reporter Brady McCombs at 573-4213 or bmccombs@azstarnet.com.\par \par \uc2 Dever's replacement\par \par \uc2 The replacement for Cochise County Sheriff Larry Dever on the Nov. 6 ballot will likely be chosen today at a Cochise County Republican Party meeting.\par \par \uc2 Dever was running unopposed for his fifth term in office before his death in a vehicle crash Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 The law allows the Republican Party to select a substitute candidate to take his ballot spot, but it must make that decision by 2 p.m. today to ensure ballots can be printed Saturday as planned.\par \par \uc2 The Cochise County Republican Party has called a meeting for noon today for the 83 precinct committee members, said Matt Creegan, Cochise County Republican chairman. They will take a vote to choose from three candidates:\par \par \uc2 * Rod Rothrock, the chief deputy of the Cochise County Sheriff's Office who became the acting sheriff upon Dever's death.\par \par \uc2 * Mark Dannels, a retired Cochise County sheriff's commander who worked under Dever.\par \par \uc2 * Billy Cloud, the Tombstone marshal who lost to Dever in the 2008 Republican primary.\par \par \uc2 The winner will have until 2 p.m. to turn in his paperwork at county headquarters, Creegan said. If the Cochise County GOP cannot make a decision, or if the person it chooses fails to get his proper paperwork in on time, the next sheriff would be chosen in a write- in election Nov. 6, said Cochise County Attorney Ed Rheinheimer.\par \par \uc2 Rothrock, Dever's chief deputy, has assumed the sheriff position now as constituted by law. The Cochise County Board of Supervisors will select a replacement to complete the remaining 3 1/2 months of Dever's current term, Rheinheimer said.

It took another 30 minutes to decide that Michael Carlson, 56, is eligible for the death penalty, finding he was guilty of killing multiple people, was on parole at the time and has prior convictions for serious offenses.\par \par \uc2 Carlson's attorneys will begin presenting mitigating evidence on Wednesday in hopes it will persuade jurors to spare his life.\par \par \uc2 Carlson, 56, was arrested in June 2009, on an outstanding Texas parole violation warrant two weeks after Kenneth "KR" Alliman, 49, and Rebecca Lofton, 52, were reported missing.\par \par \uc2 Shortly thereafter, Carlson was indicted on two counts of first- degree murder and two counts of kidnapping after he told a Tucson TV reporter he had killed the couple and burned their bodies in trash pits.\par \par \uc2 At the time, Alliman, Carlson and Lofton were living rent-free on five acres of land belonging to the Menden family.\par \par \uc2 Carlson told the TV reporter he killed the couple because they were stealing and were methamphetamine-addicted \uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2  smugglers. He also said he believed Alliman was peeping on a 17- year-old girl and endangering other children by recklessly firing weapons.\par \par \uc2 Carlson's defense attorneys, Harley Kurlander and Darlene Edminson-O'Brien, told jurors that Carlson falsely confessed to avoid going back to prison in Texas, where he had been beaten, raped and stabbed. They also suggested Larry Menden had a motive to kill the couple and that Carlson confessed to protect him.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors Nicol Green and Carolyn Nedder told jurors the physical evidence corroborated Carlson's confession, and that the defense's explanation for the "false" confession didn't make sense.

Carlson was indicted a month later after telling a TV reporter he killed the pair.\par \par \uc2 His attorneys told jurors he falsely confessed to avoid going back to the Texas prison system on a parole violation and to protect Menden, who they said had a motive to kill the pair.\par \par \uc2 During closing arguments Wednesday, Deputy Pima County Attorney Nicol Green told jurors neither reason makes sense.\par \par \uc2 If Carlson, 56, was so terrified about going back to Texas, why was he driving a stolen car and why did he give police his real name during a traffic stop around the time of the slayings? Green asked.\par \par \uc2 The truth is, Carlson wasn't terrified about going back, Green said. During his 25 years in prison, he was assaulted only twice, and the incidents took place decades ago, Green said. His prison records also show he wasn't shy about lodging complaints against the very guards he was supposedly terrified of, she said.\par \par \uc2 In addition, Carlson confessed after the Menden family abandoned him, Green said. The Mendens did not visit him in jail after his arrest, they didn't put money into his commissary account, and they didn't acknowledge his birthday.\par \par \uc2 Most people would have been angry at being shunned and wouldn't try to protect them, Green said.\par \par \uc2 The fact Carlson also described how he killed eight other people in gruesome detail - when he had not - shows he had been fantasizing about killing people for a long time, Green said.\par \par \uc2 "He fancied himself a killer," Green said.\par \par \uc2 Defense attorney Harley Kurlander told jurors the evidence points to Menden as the real killer. Menden had pointed a gun at Alliman at least once before, spoke about wanting to kill Alliman and Lofton after allegedly catching them stealing, and believed Alliman was peeping on his 17-year-old granddaughter. He also suspected the two of being methamphetamine-addicted \uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2  smugglers.\par \par \uc2 Kurlander reminded jurors that Menden told them he didn't know human remains were found in his trash pits until after the trial started, but told police Carlson confessed to him after he raked up Lofton's leg on May 26, 2009.\par \par \uc2 Menden didn't tell police about Carlson's alleged confession until a month after the slayings, Kurlander said. Fear couldn't have been the reason, because Menden and his family continued to associate with Carlson, Kurlander said.\par \par \uc2 The defense attorney also told jurors to ask themselves why Menden bought lye or lime around the time of the slayings. Menden didn't have livestock, so he didn't need to mask the smell of dead animals, Kurlander said.\par \par \uc2 "I think we can figure that one out," Kurlander said.\par \par \uc2 If Carlson is convicted, the same jury will decide whether he should be eligible for the death penalty.\par \par \uc2 Contact reporter Kim Smith at 573-4241 or kimsmith@azstarnet.com.

In Tucson ZIP codes, Obama raised $681,000 - nearly as much as he raised in the main Phoenix ZIP codes, $706,500.\par \par \uc2 But Obama's stranglehold on Southern Arizona means little so long as Romney and Republicans control Arizona's political epicenter.\par \par \uc2 Heard this one before?\par \par \uc2 Like sports, politics is brimming with old, tired cliches. Here are a few of our favorites that have been popping up again this season:\par \par \uc2 * "I've never seen such a dirty campaign."\par \par \uc2 This one is always accompanied by outrage from the candidate who swears he's never witnessed the nasty tactics his rival is using. Such declarations are usually accompanied by a sound bite about how the opposite party has stooped to new lows. As if politics was ever a gentleman's sport.\par \par \uc2 * "They must be worried."\par \par \uc2 This one always comes after an opponent gets a key endorsement from a powerful political figure or group. Instead of accepting reality that it's a sign he or she is going to get beat, the challengers loves to spin it as a sign that he or she must be a threat, and has the front-runner worried.\par \par \uc2 Wouldn't it be refreshing to hear a candidate say, "Yeah, I'll be honest, I would have really, really loved to have received that endorsement. ... It stings a bit."\par \par \uc2 * "The only poll that matters is on election day."\par \par \uc2 A poll shows less than ideal numbers for a politician? No problem. Just pull out this tried and true line. But, when the polls show a good number for your candidate, send the results out to the world and tout it as a sign that the race is in your favor.\par \par \uc2 And, finally my favorite:\par \par \uc2 * "I'm not a politician."\par \par \uc2 Oh, how candidates love to throw this one around. We've got news for every single one of you who has ever said that - yes you are. The day you decided to get in the race, you became a politician.\par \par \uc2 If you truly weren't a politician, you would have just stayed out of the race.\par \par \uc2 Contact reporter Brady McCombs at 573-4213 or bmccombs@azstarnet.com Twitter: @BradyMcCombs\par \par \uc2 On StarNet: Brady McCombs will keep you aware of all of the political news with the Pueblo Politics blog at azstarnet.com/ pueblopolitics\par \par \uc2 Document TUCS000020120912e88q0000x\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 TUCSON/REGION\par {\*\bkmkstart toc83}{\*\bkmkend toc83}\b \uc2 Latino evangelicals find political voice\b0\par\par\uc2 JOSEPH TREVInO   \par \uc2 JOSEPH TREVInO, ARIZONA DAILY STAR\par \uc2 514 \uc2 words\par \uc2 22 August 2012\par \uc2 The Arizona Daily Star\par \uc2 TUCS\par \uc2 FINAL\par A2\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2012 The Arizona Daily Star.

But change came from an event no one could predict: The 1986 immigration amnesty.\par \par \uc2 "Now the silent giant has awoken, and nothing can make it go to sleep again," Rodriguez said.\par \par \uc2 Latino evangelicals tend to hold the following political views: They are anti-abortion, pro-family, against same-sex marriages, for religious liberty and are committed to defending immigrant rights, Rodriguez said.\par \par \uc2 Their political quest is leading Latino evangelicals to hold hands with an unlikely group: Catholics.\par \par \uc2 The Obama administration's health-care mandate, which requires companies' insurance plans to provide contraceptives, has managed to unite the two faith groups, Rodriguez said.\par \par \uc2 "We are seeing a great collaboration, where the barriers of the past have been overcome", Rodriguez said. "It is a beautiful day."\par \par \uc2 For Luis Rodriguez (no relation to Samuel Rodriguez), Latino evangelicals face a choice. Rodriguez said both President Obama and \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2  are good candidates, but Obama's support for gay marriage rights, access to birth control and abortion, which evangelicals oppose - and Romney's anti-\uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2  rhetoric - are disturbing.\par \par \uc2 In the past, Latino evangelicals tended to vote Republican, but lately more have been registering as independents, Samuel Rodriguez said.\par \par \uc2 "I don't want Hispanics to be married to a political party," he said. "I want the Hispanic community to be exclusively married to the Lamb's (Jesus Christ's) agenda.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Point to clandestine border crime, may even be tied to agent's killing\par \par \uc2 When a hiker in Madera Canyon discovered three AK-47-type rifles wrapped in plastic last month, it may have seemed like a random occurrence.\par \par \uc2 It wasn't.\par \par \uc2 Across Southern Arizona's borderlands, workers, residents or visitors occasionally come across weapons that apparently have been stashed or ditched by criminals. In two cases this year, people in areas managed by the \uc2 Bureau of Land Management\uc2  have found stashed, plastic-wrapped rifles.\par \par \uc2 And in a fourth incident this year, a young border-crosser said the two guides of his large group stashed plastic bags of weapons in a cave southwest of Tucson. Inside, the 17-year-old told a Pima County Sheriff's investigator, were guns like the kind you see in action movies - and grenades.\par \par \uc2 Each incident may have its own explanation, but there are common reasons for the stashes, said Santa Cruz County Sheriff Tony Estrada.\par \par \uc2 "They'll put them in a strategic place, and when they're going to rip somebody off or going to protect a load, they go retrieve them," Estrada said.\par \par \uc2 The phenomenon may also be relevant to the killing of U.S. Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry near Rio Rico in December 2010. Federal prosecutors have said the six defendants in the case crossed the border from Mexico early that month and picked up weapons that were cached north of the line.\par \par \uc2 They declined to detail how or where the defendants got the guns, which were bought in January 2010 by a young man named Jaime Avila, now a defendant in the notorious Operation Fast and Furious case. But Terry's cousin, Robert Heyer of San Diego, said he would like to see investigators uncover whoever stored the weapons for his cousin's alleged killers.\par \par \uc2 "Where did they go once Jaime Avila walked out of the Lone Wolf Gun Store on Jan. 10, 2010?" Heyer asked.\par \par \uc2 connection to migrant\par \par \uc2 The story of the long guns and grenades would never have emerged if a woman hadn't died while crossing the border in May. Mariana Chaverri Pina entered the United States May 5 with her 17-year-old nephew and a group of about 40 illegal immigrants, the nephew told a Pima County sheriff's investigator.\par \par \uc2 Three days into their journey, the group began to climb a mountain ridge, apparently in the Baboquivari Mountains southwest of Tucson, and arrived at a cave, the report says.\par \par \uc2 "Once they got to the cave, both the guide and his assistant put their bag of guns into the cave," the report said. The teen "stated that he did not get a good look at what the guns and grenades looked like because once the guides had removed the packs from their backs, they told the rest of the group to go wait downhill a little bit and he walked away."\par \par \uc2 The group stayed that night in the area, and the next day, the teen's aunt was bit by a rattlesnake. The group left her behind, and she eventually died and was found by area residents. The boy was later captured by the Border Patrol, and it was May 13 by the time a sheriff's deputy heard hisstory.\par \par \uc2 Neither the sheriff's department nor the Border Patrol acknowledged following up by searching for the weapons.\par \par \uc2 In a written statement, Border Patrol spokesman Brent Cagen said, "Occasionally, abandoned weapons are recovered in the desert. Firearms seized by \uc2 U.S. Customs and Border Protection\uc2  agencies in Arizona are then test-fired for cross-matching through the National Integrated Ballistic Information Network to determine whether any of the weapons were used in the commission of a crime."\par \par \uc2 Rifle uncovered\par \par \uc2 On Feb. 29, volunteers from Friends of the Ironwood Forest were cleaning up a wash where \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  or smuggling groups had left trash near the Silver Bell Mountains, northwest of Marana, said Jon Young, state chief ranger for the \uc2 Bureau of Land Management\uc2  in Arizona. One of them saw the corner of a plastic bag sticking out from the sand and pulled on it. Out came a plastic bag wrapped in a T-shirt and containing a Mac-90 rifle.\par \par \uc2 A similar discovery happened three days later. On March 2, about 300 yards south of Interstate 8 in an area west of Casa Grande, a ranger found a plastic bag wrapped in a T-shirt underneath a pile of brush. Inside was an AK-47-style assault rifle and a 30-round magazine loaded with 28 rounds.\par \par \uc2 Young said he isn't sure why rangers find weapons in the monuments, but he thinks smugglers' concerns offer an explanation.\par \par \uc2 "A lot of the scouts or cartel members tend to work the same areas. They come and go out of these remote areas," Young said. "I think it's probably riskier for them to be traveling with a weapon. They store the weapon in an area where they know they're either going to use them or keep them in the future."\par \par \uc2 If members of the public find weapons, they should call 911 or a local law-enforcement office, he said.\par \par \uc2 Contact reporter Tim Steller at 807-8427 or tsteller@azstarnet.com\par \par \uc2 On StarNet: Find extensive coverage of immigration and border issues at azstarnet.com/border\par \par \uc2 Document TUCS000020120801e87m0001n\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 TUCSON/REGION\par {\*\bkmkstart toc88}{\*\bkmkend toc88}\b \uc2 PBS explores Border Patrol conduct\b0\par\par\uc2 PHIL VILLARREAL   \par \uc2 PHIL VILLARREAL, ARIZONA DAILY STAR\par \uc2 193 \uc2 words\par \uc2 20 July 2012\par \uc2 The Arizona Daily Star\par \uc2 TUCS\par \uc2 FINAL\par A10\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2012 The Arizona Daily Star.

The Border Patrol said via a statement it was unaware of the incident, but that "The group did, in fact, do the right thing by contacting the local authorities."\par \par \uc2 After two days of hearing nothing from officials, the Samaritans moved into action.\par \par \uc2 not a casual consideration\par \par \uc2 Olson-Garewal's volunteer work for the Samaritans is far from a casual pastime. She said that for years, her late husband, Dr. Harinder Garewal, the one-time chief of medical oncology at Southern Arizona VA medical center, had spoken of taking some time off from work and volunteering for a humanitarian group like the Samaritans.\par \par \uc2 Garewal passed away in 2010 before the couple could realize their humanitarian goals, his widow said. In a way, helping dehydrated border crossers was, for Olson-Garewal, a sort of a homage to the memory of her husband.\par \par \uc2 Thus Olson-Garewal joined the Samaritans as they hopped into their off-road SUVs and drove to the desert, where they searched on foot.\par \par \uc2 On Saturday, May 19, Olson-Garewal, following a hunch, decided to go back out alone with her son.\par \par \uc2 "Then it dawned on me that because of the rain, the body had washed in a certain direction," Olson-Garewal says.\par \par \uc2 Her son announced, "'I know where it is.' There was a vulture ... that was what tipped him off."\par \par \uc2 Only after helping sheriff's deputies remove the body did Raj, a literature student who is heading to England this fall to continue his studies, realize how shocked he was by the gruesome sight of the bloated and decomposed body partially devoured by animals.\par \par \uc2 He threw up.\par \par \uc2 "He said, 'Mom, this is terrible. This is so wrong,' " Olson- Garewal said.\par \par \uc2 Decade-long commitment\par \par \uc2 The Samaritans, who are based out of the \uc2 Southside Presbyterian Church\uc2  and go out to the desert every day, have pro-immigrant roots that stretch back more than 10 years.\par \par \uc2 The group was formed by volunteers including the Rev. \uc2 John Fife\uc2  and many former members of the Sanctuary Movement, which aided Central American refugees and attracted worldwide attention during the 1980s. The Samaritans also immediately attracted international attention and sparked controversy.\par \par \uc2 The group, one of several humanitarian border organizations, claims to have about 300 members. This weekend, it will commemorate its 10th anniversary, but instead of calling it a cause for celebration, they say it is a tragedy, since they believe the border issue should have been resolved long ago.\par \par \uc2 "We note with sadness the 10th year of a humanitarian disaster at our border," said Kathryn Ferguson, the group's spokeswoman. "The migration north of individuals across the U.S.-Mexico border continues to cause an appalling level of mortality, morbidity and loss of human dignity."\par \par \uc2 Brent Cagen, spokesman for the Tucson Border Patrol, said his office shares the concern of the Samaritans and other humanitarian groups regarding border crossers and tries to reduce fatalities by disseminating "a forthright message regarding the many dangers associated with illegally crossing our borders."\par \par \uc2 "This message is delivered to communities throughout Mexico, Central and South America through public service announcements, pamphlets and with the assistance of the Mexican, Central and South American governments."\par \par \uc2 In addition, Cagen said, the Border Patrol strives to build relationships with local humanitarian groups.

Tucson es mi hogar. No conozco otro lugar", expreso Hernandez. Ella intenta que le cancelen su deportacion con la orden ejecutiva que dio el presidente Obama el 15 de Junio.\par \par \uc2 La orden permite que aquellos que fueron traidos a Estados Unidos ilegalmente cuando ninos puedan permanecer en el pais bajo ciertas condiciones.\par \par \uc2 Hernandez explico que en Junio del 2010, un agente del Condado Pima la paro cuando manejaba. Dijo que no la detuvo por una infraccion de transito, sino que el alguacil llamo a la Patrulla Fronteriza cuando ella no pudo comprobar su residencia legal.\par \par \uc2 Dijo que estuvo encarcelada en diferentes centros de detencion durante tres semanas.\par \par \uc2 Hernandez ahora es miembro de Corazon de Tucson, un grupo que educa a sus participantes sobre sus derechos civiles y las leyes estatales y federales.\par \par \uc2 El supervisor del Condado Pima, \uc2 Richard Elias\uc2 , dijo que "la Corte Suprema codifico la parte de SB 1070 que ataca las libertades civiles y los derechos humanos de las personas.\par \par \uc2 "... La discriminacion por perfil racial es inevitable si se promulgan las disposiciones de la SB 1070 que fueron aprobadas hoy por la Corte".\par \par \uc2 Elias anuncio que exigira que se realicen foros comunitarios para que el alguacil Clarence Dupnik y el jefe de Policia de Tucson, Roberto Villasenor, o sus administradores, puedan discutir como las agencias del orden van a cumplir con la ley.\par \par \uc2 La Concejal de la Ciudad de Tucson, \uc2 Regina Romero\uc2 , estuvo de acuerdo con Elias respecto a los foros. Dijo que ella pedira que haya una discusion abierta con el abogado municipal y el jefe de la Policia sobre el refuerzo de la ley y sus efectos.\par \par \uc2 "Me da miedo que los inmigrantes ya no reporten los crimenes y que desconfien de la policia", dijo Romero. "Todos los avances del pasado se borraran. Eso me preocupa".\par \par \uc2 Aun si la policia local continua entregandoles individuos a los oficiales de inmigracion, muchos de ellos no seran recogidos dados los nuevos reglamentos que anuncio el Departamento de Seguridad Nacional tan solo horas despues del fallo de la Corte.\par \par \uc2 En Arizona, los oficiales de inmigracion ha sido instruidos para que no recojan a inmigrantes indocumentados que hayan sido detenidos por la policia local, al menos que el individuo sea:\par \par \uc2 * Un criminal condenado\par \par \uc2 * Alguien que haya sido deportado en el pasado\par \par \uc2 * O alguien que haya cruzado la frontera recientemente.\par \par \uc2 El Departamento de Seguridad Nacional continuara cumpliendo con el requisito legal de recibir las llamadas de los agentes del orden local para verificar el estatus migratorio de personas, dijeron los oficiales federales.\par \par \uc2 El Departamento de Seguridad Nacional tambien anuncio que ha revocado algunos acuerdos que tenia bajo el programa conocido como el 287(g). Los acuerdos se habian hecho con fuerzas operacionales de siete agencias del orden en Arizona, incluyendo el Departamento de Seguridad Publica de Arizona, el Departamento del Alguacil del Condado Pima y la Oficina del Alguacil del Condado Pinal.\par \par \uc2 Los oficiales del Departamento de Seguridad Nacional dicen que las fuerzas operacionales, en las que los oficiales de inmigracion trabajaban con la policia local para realizar investigaciones en el campo, no son utiles en los estados donde se han adoptado politicas migratorias como la SB 1070.\par \par \uc2 Los acuerdos de las carceles del programa 287(g) aun permanecen con ocho agencias, incluyendo el Departamento del Alguacil del Condado Pima. En el programa de las carceles, los oficiales de inmigracion trabajan con la policia local para investigar a las personas que ingresan a ellas.\par \par \uc2 Los lideres de las agencias del orden que estaban tratando de entender lo que significaria para ellos el fallo de la Corte Suprema, se vieron aun mas perdidos frente a las directivas del Departamento de Seguridad Nacional.\par \par \uc2 El jefe de Policia de Tucson, Roberto Villasenor; el alguacil del Condado Pima, Clarence Dupnik, y el alguacil del Condado Santa Cruz, Tony Estrada, dijeron que planean pedirle apoyo a la Patrulla Fronteriza para llegar a un entendimiento mejor de las implicaciones.\par \par \uc2 Las tres agencias entregan con regularidad a la Patrulla Fronteriza a los inmigrantes indocumentados que se encuentran durante sus patrullajes.\par \par \uc2 "Hemos tratado de contactar a la Patrulla Fronteriza hoy, sin exito, para determinar que quieren decir exactamente con eso", dijo Dupnik. "Si quiere decir lo que parece, que no van a responder, eso significa que no podemos reforzar la ley cuando hay violaciones migratorias".\par \par \uc2 La pregunta de los lideres de las agencias del orden es: ?que deben de hacer ellos si los oficiales de inmigracion no vienen a recoger a una persona que se cite por un delito menor y que se haya verificado por telefono que esta aqui ilegalmente?\par \par \uc2 Villasenor esta bajo la impresion de que sus oficiales habran cumplido con la ley si llaman a los oficiales de inmigracion respecto al estatus de una persona que se sospeche que este aqui ilegalmente.\par \par \uc2 Si la Patrulla Fronteriza no puede, o simplemente no recoge al individuo, ellos liberaran a la persona, comento.\par \par \uc2 "Todo va a depender de la capacidad de la Patrulla Fronteriza o del ICE para respondernos rapidamente", dijo Villasenor.\par \par \uc2 Pero no hay uniformidad entre agencias, o segun la ley, sobre cuanto un oficial debe de esperar.\par \par \uc2 La policia de Tuccson le instruye a sus oficiales que espere "tanto como sea necesario para cumplir el objetivo de la detencion inicial", dijo Villasenor.\par \par \uc2 Los agentes del alguacil en el Condado Pima y Santa Cruz liberan a la persona si la Patrulla Fronteriza no llega en un periodo de tiempo razonable, dijeron Dupnik y Estrada.\par \par \uc2 Como habra miles de llamadas adicionales que los oficiales locales le tendran que hacer a los de inmigracion, va a ser aun mas dificil que respondan las agencias federales de inmigracion.\par \par \uc2 "No estoy seguro de que puedan adaptarse a esa cantidad de trabajo ahora mismo", dijo Villasenor.\par \par \uc2 Aun antes de que el Departamento de Seguridad Nacional hiciera su anuncio, los lideres de las agencias del orden y los abogados municipales estaban buscando como lidiar con el fallo de la Corte Suprema.\par \par \uc2 La Ciudad y el Departamento de Policia de Tucson estan repasando el fallo de la Corte Suprema y recibiran un asesoramiento legal durante una sesion ejecutiva en la junta del Concejo de la Ciudad, dijo el alcalde de Tucson, Jonathan Rothschild.\par \par \uc2 Villasenor juro reforzar la ley "que ha aprobado la Corte Suprema", pero dijo que su departamento esta esperando para ver que pasa cuando la ley se mande de vuelta a la juez Superior de Distrito, Susan Bolton.\par \par \uc2 "Hasta que eso ocurra, nosotros vamos a continuar con nuestras politicas actuales", dijo Villasenor. "?Cuando tomara lugar eso? No lo se".\par \par \uc2 Dupnik dijo el Lunes 25 por la tarde que no sabra con seguridad como el fallo de la Corte Suprema afectara al departamento hasta que los abogados del condado examinen la decision.\par \par \uc2 Pero aun sin recibir direccion, Dupnik considero que el fallo no afectara la forma en que sus comisarios realizaran sus patrullajes. El Alguacil, quien se opuso radicalmente a la SB 1070 cuando se introdujo en el 2010, dijo que el departamento ya esta reforzando la politica migratoria federal al referirle a la Patrulla Fronteriza a quienes sospechan que estan aqui ilegalmente.\par \par \uc2 El departamento tambien trabaja estrechamente con los agentes de la Patrulla Fronteriza asignados a la unidad Border Crimes (Crimenes Fronterizos) del Departamento.\par \par \uc2 Villasenor reflejo los comentarios de Dupnik, al decir que los oficiales de la Policia de Tucson siempre han podido llamar a la Patrulla Fronteriza si sospechan que un individuo esta aqui ilegalmente, y lo hacen con frecuencia. Los oficiales utilizan su criterio y consideran que tan ocupados estan, entre otros factores, comento.\par \par \uc2 "El problema con la SB 1070 es que nos prohibe usar nuestro criterio", dijo Villasenor.\par \par \uc2 Contacta a Carmen Duarte en cduarte@azstarnet.com o al 573-4104.\par \par \uc2 Contacta a Brady McCombs en bmccombs@azstarnet.com o al 573- 4213.\par \par \uc2 La reportera Veronica Cruz contribuyo a este reportaje.\par \par \uc2 English version\par \par \uc2 Civil rights and immigration advocates were angered by the Supreme Court's ruling Monday that Arizona can require police to check the immigration status of those they stop.\par \par \uc2 The ruling, said speakers, will lead to racial profiling of Hispanics and create fear for illegal immigrants in Tucson.\par \par \uc2 The same day Homeland Security said it will not send its officers to pick up any suspected \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  snared by local police in Arizona unless the person meets the agency's priority criteria.\par \par \uc2 The decision by Homeland Security brings into question whether much will actually change on the ground in Arizona when law officers are finally required, under the surviving provision of SB 1070, to check the immigration status of those they have stopped.\par \par \uc2 Opponents of SB 1070 said they will continue to work to dismantle the controversial law, regardless of the uncertainty created by the Supreme Court's ruling and decision by Homeland Security. Some 50 people joined speakers at an afternoon news conference June 25 at the downtown state building on West Congress Street and North Granada Avenue.\par \par \uc2 "We will continue to work to repeal SB 1070 because it is an unjust law," said Alison Harrington, pastor of Southside Presbyterian Church on Tucson's south side.\par \par \uc2 "This law promotes fear among our community where people are scared to go to the grocery store, church and hospitals.\par \par \uc2 Alma Hernandez, 28, said she understands the fear undocumented immigrants feel.\par \par \uc2 "I am a mother of three children, and I am fighting deportation so I can stay home with my family," explained Hernandez who has lived in Tucson as an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  since she was 8 years old.\par \par \uc2 "My parents moved our family here from Guadalajara for a better life. Tucson is my home. I know no other one," said Hernandez, who is seeking a cancellation of deportation under President Obama's June 15th executive order allowing those brought to the United States illegally as children to remain under certain conditions.\par \par \uc2 Hernandez said on June 2010 a Pima County sheriff's deputy pulled her over while she was driving. She said she was not cited for a traffic violation. Rather the deputy called Border Patrol agents when she could not prove legal residency.\par \par \uc2 She said she was locked up in detention centers for three weeks.\par \par \uc2 Hernandez said she now is a member of Corazon de Tucson, an advocacy group that educates members about their civil rights, and state and federal laws.\par \par \uc2 Pima County Supervisor \uc2 Richard Elias\uc2 , said the "Supreme Court codified the portion of SB 1070 that attacks people's civil liberties and human rights.\par \par \uc2 "... racial profiling is inevitable if the provisions of SB 1070 approved today by the court are enacted."\par \par \uc2 Elias said he will call for community forums so that Sheriff Clarence Dupnik and Tucson police Chief Roberto Villasenor, or their administrators, can discuss what actions will be taken by local law enforcement to comply with the ruling.\par \par \uc2 Tucson City Councilwoman \uc2 Regina Romero\uc2  agreed with Elias about the forums. She said she will call for open discussion with the city attorney and police chief about the law's enforcement and its effects.\par \par \uc2 "I fear that the immigrant population will no longer report crime, and they will distrust police," said Romero. "All the inroads made in the past will be erased. This worries me."\par \par \uc2 Even if local police continue to turn people over to immigration officials, many of them will not be picked up under the guidelines announced just hours after the Supreme Court's ruling, by the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 In Arizona, immigration officers have been instructed not to pick up an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  stopped by local police, unless the person is:\par \par \uc2 * A convicted criminal\par \par \uc2 * Someone who has been deported in the past\par \par \uc2 * Or a recent illegal border crosser.\par \par \uc2 Homeland Security will continue to comply with its legal requirement to take phone calls from local law enforcement to verify a person's immigration status, federal officials said.\par \par \uc2 Homeland Security also announced it has revoked task-force agreements it had under a program known as 287(g) with seven Arizona law enforcement agencies, including the \uc2 Arizona Department of Public Safety\uc2  , the Pima County Sheriff's Department and the Pinal County Sheriff's Office.\par \par \uc2 Homeland Security officials say the task forces, in which immigration officers and local police worked together on investigations in the field, are no longer useful in states that have adopted immigration enforcement laws such as SB 1070.\par \par \uc2 The 287(g) program's jail agreements remain in place with eight agencies, including the Pima County Sheriff's Department. In the jail programs, immigration officers work with local police to help screen people booked into the jails.\par \par \uc2 For local law enforcement leaders already trying to make sense of what the Supreme Court's ruling means for them, the Homeland Security directives created even more confusion.\par \par \uc2 Tucson Police Chief Roberto Villasenor, Pima County Sheriff Clarence Dupnik and Santa Cruz County Sheriff Tony Estrada said they plan to reach out to the U.S. Border Patrol to better understand the implications. All three agencies regularly turn over illegal immigrants they encounter during their patrols to the Border Patrol.\par \par \uc2 "We've tried to get in touch with the Border Patrol today, unsuccessfully, to determine exactly what they mean by that," Dupnik said. "If it means what you think it means, that they're not going respond, that puts us in the position of not being able to enforce immigration violations under the federal law."\par \par \uc2 One question that lingers for law enforcement leaders is what they'll be required to do if immigration officers don't come to pick up a person cited for a misdemeanor whom they've verified by phone is here illegally.\par \par \uc2 Villasenor is under the impression his officers will have met the law's requirement if they call immigration officers about the status of a person they suspect may be here illegally. If a Border Patrol can't, or won't, pick the person up, they'll release the person, he said.\par \par \uc2 "It's all going to hinge on Border Patrol or ICE's ability to respond quickly to us," Villasenor said.\par \par \uc2 But there is no uniformity among agencies, or set by the law, as to how long an officer should wait. Tucson police instruct their officers to wait "as long as it takes to accomplish what the original stop was for,"' Villasenor said. Sheriff's deputies in Pima and Santa Cruz counties release a person if Border Patrol doesn't arrive in a reasonable amount of time, said Dupnik and Estrada.\par \par \uc2 With thousands of additional calls that will need to be made by local officers to immigration officers, it's only get going to get more difficult for federal immigration agencies to respond.\par \par \uc2 "I'm not sure that they are set up to accommodate that workload right now," Villasenor said.\par \par \uc2 Even before Homeland Security made its announcements, law enforcement leaders and city attorneys were grappling with how to move forward based on the Supreme Court ruling.\par \par \uc2 The city of Tucson and the Tucson Police Department are reviewing the Supreme Court's ruling and will receive legal advice during an executive session at today's City Council meeting, said Tucson Mayor Jonathan Rothschild.\par \par \uc2 Villasenor vowed to enforce the law "as upheld by the Supreme Court" but said the department is waiting to see what happens when the law is sent back to U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton.\par \par \uc2 "Until that takes place, we are continuing with our policies as is," Villasenor said. "What the timeline for that will be, I don't know."\par \par \uc2 Dupnik said Monday afternoon he won't know for sure how the Supreme Court's ruling affects the department until county attorneys examine the decision.\par \par \uc2 But, even without that guidance, Dupnik said the ruling will have no bearing on how his deputies go about their patrols. The sheriff, who vehemently opposed SB 1070 when it was introduced in 2010, said the department already enforces federal immigration law by referring people it suspects are here illegally to the Border Patrol. The department also works closely with Border Patrol agents assigned to the department's Border Crimes Unit.\par \par \uc2 Villasenor echoed Dupnik's remarks, saying Tucson police officers have always been able to call the Border Patrol if they suspect a person is here illegally and do so regularly. Officers use their discretion based on how busy they are and other factors, he said.\par \par \uc2 "The problem with SB 1070 is that it takes away that discretion," Villasenor said.\par \par \uc2 Asi lo dijo\par \par \uc2 Congresista Raul Grijalva, Democrata, Distrito 7:\par \par \uc2 "La decision de hoy revoco una ley que siempre hemos reconocido como un intento de extremistas para socavar nuestros valores y nuestra Constitucion.

We will serve the people of this community regardless of their immigration status," said Harrington, who ministers at a church that was in the forefront of the nationwide underground Sanctuary Movement for Central Americans in the 1980s.\par \par \uc2 Alma Hernandez, 28, said she understands the fear undocumented immigrants feel.\par \par \uc2 "I am a mother of three children, and I am fighting deportation so I can stay home with my family," explained Hernandez who has lived in Tucson as an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  since she was 8 years old.\par \par \uc2 "My parents moved our family here from Guadalajara for a better life. Tucson is my home. I know no other one," said Hernandez, who is seeking a cancellation of deportation under President Obama's recent executive order allowing those brought to the United States illegally as children to remain under certain conditions.\par \par \uc2 Hernandez said in June 2010 a Pima County sheriff's deputy pulled her over while she was driving. She said she was not cited for a traffic violation. Rather the deputy called Border Patrol agents when she could not prove legal residency.\par \par \uc2 She said she was locked up in detention centers for three weeks.\par \par \uc2 Hernandez said she now is a member of Corazon de Tucson, or Heart of Tucson, an advocacy group that educates members about their civil rights and state and federal laws.\par \par \uc2 Pima County Supervisor Richard Elias, said the "Supreme Court codified the portion of SB 1070 that attacks people's civil liberties and human rights. ... Racial profiling is inevitable if the provisions of SB 1070 approved today by the court are enacted."\par \par \uc2 Elias said he will call for community forums so that Sheriff Clarence Dupnik and Tucson Police Chief Roberto Villasenor, or their administrators, can discuss what actions will be taken by local law enforcement to comply with the ruling.\par \par \uc2 Tucson City Councilwoman Regina Romero agreed with Elias about the forums. She said she will call today for open discussion with the city attorney and police chief about the law's enforcement and its effects.\par \par \uc2 "I fear that the immigrant population will no longer report crime, and they will distrust police," said Romero. "All the inroads made in the past will be erased. This worries me."\par \par \uc2 Contact reporter Carmen Duarte at 573-4104 or cduarte@azstarnet.com\par \par \uc2 Document TUCS000020120713e86q0000q\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 TUCSON/REGION\par {\*\bkmkstart toc93}{\*\bkmkend toc93}\b \uc2 Rothschild joins call to give in-state tuition to crossers Rothschild says crossers merit in-state tuition\b0\par\par\uc2 DARREN DARONCO   \par \uc2 DARREN DARONCO, ARIZONA DAILY STAR\par \uc2 422 \uc2 words\par \uc2 16 June 2012\par \uc2 The Arizona Daily Star\par \uc2 TUCS\par \uc2 FINAL\par A2\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2012 The Arizona Daily Star.

A vote is expected today.\par \par \uc2 "Living in the Tucson and Southern Arizona, I've had the personal experience of seeing young people go through our school system ... and kids have been valedictorians or got all A's and worked really hard and were admitted to colleges," said Rothschild, who will not be in Orlando.\par \par \uc2 "But they were slowed down or stymied in their progress in getting an education" because their parents brought them to the United States when they were young and they lack citizenship, therefore they do not qualify for federal student loans or in-state tuition.\par \par \uc2 These individuals, who work diligently and succeed in school, Rothschild said, are the types of people this country needs.\par \par \uc2 "They have already proved themselves to be productive young members of our society," he said. "They are the exact people that we want to encourage to get further education. So I think it's real important we give deserving young people a chance" to advance.\par \par \uc2 The DREAM Act would allow undocumented students, who met some basic requirements, to be granted a six-year grace period to obtain a degree or serve in the military. If they meet all of the prescribed goals, they could apply for permanent status.\par \par \uc2 In Arizona, about 167,000 students would qualify, according to a 2010 study by the \uc2 Migration Policy Institute\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Contact reporter Darren DaRonco at ddaronco@azstarnet.com or 573-4243.\par \par \uc2 On StarNet: Find extensive coverage of immigration issues at azstarnet.com/border\par \par \uc2 Document TUCS000020120711e86g0000e\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 NEWS\par {\*\bkmkstart toc94}{\*\bkmkend toc94}\b \uc2 Where GOP contenders in CD8 stand on 4 key issues\b0\par\par\uc2 ARIZONA DAILY STAR\par \uc2 2,318 \uc2 words\par \uc2 25 March 2012\par \uc2 The Arizona Daily Star\par \uc2 TUCS\par \uc2 FINAL\par A5\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2012 The Arizona Daily Star.

I've put the four questions at the top and then the answers to each of those questions from the candidates below. . . . At the bottom are the bio boxes.\par \par \uc2 Questions:\par \par \uc2 1) On jobs, and the economy: Name at least two concrete steps you would take to jump-start the economy and create more jobs in Arizona?\par \par \uc2 2) On border security:Considering many believe we must secure the border before engaging in immigration reform discussions, how do you propose we measure whether the border is 'secure?'\par \par \uc2 3) On Social Security: What do you suggest we do to ensure future generations get their Social Security benefits?\par \par \uc2 4) On the budget: When it comes to cutting the budget, name at least two federal agencies you consider untouchable. Why, briefly.\par \par \uc2 Martha McSally's answers:\par \par \uc2 1) First, simplify the tax code and cut taxes for middle class families. Then reduce regulations for small businesses. In the 1980s, small business owners had to deal with paperwork and regulatory requirements dictated by 31 federal and state agencies. By 2000, that number was 57. Today it's even higher.\par \par \uc2 2) We need an integrated intelligence-driven strategy for securing our borders to thwart this national security threat and its root causes. We have no idea who or what is coming across our borders and for what purpose. Security means knowing who and what is coming into our country, and controlling it.\par \par \uc2 3) We must keep the promises we've made to seniors and veterans. But a decade of irresponsible spending has left us some tough choices. We need to look at gradually increasing the retirement age for younger workers and giving individuals more options to invest part of their benefits for higher returns.\par \par \uc2 4) None. There are some things, like our national defense, that only the federal government can provide. Yet, as a retired Colonel, I know that even the Department of Defense can gain efficiency without sacrificing security. Every item in the budget needs to be examined line by line.\par \par \uc2 Dave Sitton's answers:\par \par \uc2 1) My 10-point plan for jobs/economy has district-specific concrete steps including supporting the military missions at Davis- Monthan and Fort Huachuca and fostering free-market competition within our emerging biotech and "Geotourism" industries. Additionally, we must renew the American commitment to free enterprise by limiting government interference in the market.\par \par \uc2 2) Our border must be better secured. It is a national security imperative. The number of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  apprehensions is one measure of the problem. Equally important, however, is drug seizures, border-related private property crime, home invasions, and environmental degradation (including wildfires). We need new commonsense measures of the problem.\par \par \uc2 3) We must keep our commitment to seniors assuring they get the benefits they have planned on. But no longer can we "protect" Social Security; we must "preserve" it for future generations. Reform includes modernizing the retirement age and offering younger workers optional personal accounts for a portion of their money.\par \par \uc2 4) Nothing in our national budget is untouchable. Waste, fraud, abuse, and redundancy exist throughout. Every expenditure must be justified annually. Citizens deserve to know where their hard- earned taxes are being spent because government transparency is key to restoring America's free enterprise system.\par \par \uc2 Jesse Kelly's answers:\par \par \uc2 1) Lower taxes on individuals and businesses and reduce unnecessary federal regulations. Open up the energy sector so we can fully develop our energy resources and reduce the price of gas.\par \par \uc2 2) Complete the double layer border fence and hire more border patrol agents. Put those additional agents on the border and let them do their job to stop narcotics and people from illegally entering this country.\par \par \uc2 3) Grow the economy to provide more revenue. Protect the current system by no longer raiding the trust fund for unrelated programs. Allow younger workers the choice of placing a portion of their contributions into a personal account - similar to the current Federal Thrift Savings Plan.\par \par \uc2 4) There are no agencies in the federal government that should not be reviewed for cost savings. We must review all federal programs in order to save this nation from bankruptcy.\par \par \uc2 Frank Antenori's answers:\par \par \uc2 1) a. Immediately Repeal Obamacare. It's onerous and yet unknown regulations have stifled investment, created uncertainty, and killed jobs. b. Put an immediate moratorium on new regulations and rule making for all government agencies. Immediately begin rolling back onerous regulations that hamper new business creation.\par \par \uc2 2) When a fence or sensor covers the entire southern border, and enough border patrol agents to rapidly respond to any incursion and apprehend illegal border crossers. The ultimate standard is when ranchers and residents no longer need to worry about their lives being threatened, homes broken into, and property damaged.\par \par \uc2 3) First, prevent Congress from raiding Social Security and further depleting the fund. Then, increase the number of oil, gas, and mineral leases with a portion of the fee going to Social Security. This does two things, it increases domestic energy production and provides additional revenue to protect Social Security.\par \par \uc2 4) All government agencies should receive budget scrutiny and justify their appropriations. However the funding priority must be centered on the primary role of the Federal Government: National Security. Therefore, our defense and intelligence capabilities must not be unnecessarily compromised just for the sake of cutting spending.\par \par \uc2 Name: Jesse Kelly\par \par \uc2 * Party: Republican\par \par \uc2 * Age: 30\par \par \uc2 * Employer and position: Project manager in his family construction business, Don Kelly Construction.\par \par \uc2 * Education: Some college at Montana State.\par \par \uc2 * Political experience: Lost in 2010 to Rep.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 CORRECTION RAN MARCH 22, 2012, A2\par \par \uc2 "Report: Border-watch groups vanishing," Sunday on C4, listed the wrong place as the headquarters of the Center for Immigration Studies. The center is based in Washington, D.C.\par \par \uc2 Legislatures, others step in, says \uc2 Southern Poverty Law Center\par \par \uc2 The Minuteman border-watch movement that exploded in Southern Arizona in the last decade has virtually disappeared, a new report says.\par \par \uc2 But that's in part because the members' concerns about illegal immigration have been adopted by other groups and state legislatures, the \uc2 Southern Poverty Law Center\uc2  said in its annual report on groups it considers part of the political extreme.\par \par \uc2 In 2011, the number of groups termed by the center as "nativist extremists" - such as the Minuteman - declined by 42 percent, but at the same time the number of anti-government "Patriot" groups grew to record levels, the center said. The 1,274 extreme anti-government groups tabbed as belonging to the Patriot movement was the highest number since the center counted 858 in 1996.\par \par \uc2 The center attributed the growth in the number of these groups to the country's economic difficulties, a proliferation in conspiracy theories about the government and the president, and the prospect of four more years of the Obama presidency, among other factors.\par \par \uc2 In conducting its annual census of what it considers extremist groups, the center tries to differentiate between groups critical of the federal government and those motivated by groundless conspiracy theories, such as that the government is planning to round up citizens in concentration camps, said \uc2 Heidi Beirich\uc2 , director of the center's intelligence project.\par \par \uc2 The center tracks such groups, she said, because "we're concerned about domestic terrorism."\par \par \uc2 Adherents to these beliefs sometimes become so convinced "that the government is going to imminently do some kind of harm that they decide to take some kind of action," she said.\par \par \uc2 But not everyone considers the Alabama-based law center, which began as a civil-rights group in 1971, a reliable source on extremism. Longtime Arizona Republic reporter Jerry Kammer, now a staffer at the Center for Immigration Studies in Virginia, has written several critiques of the center's work, especially on anti- illegal-immigration groups.\par \par \uc2 Kammer called it a "hysteria and hype machine that cons the well intentioned but poorly informed."\par \par \uc2 "In its hysteria to sound the alarm about 'record levels' of hate, the SPLC assembles phony and trivial statistics that distract attention from the truly dangerous groups," Kammer said via email.\par \par \uc2 Members of Arizona's Constitution Party were surprised to hear they are classified as an extreme anti-government Patriot group. The party is "anti-big-government" but not "completely anti- government," said James Hoodenpyle, chairman of the party's Maricopa County branch.\par \par \uc2 The Libertarian Party, for example, probably believes in a more limited government than the Constitution Party does, Hoodenpyle said.\par \par \uc2 This is how the law center describes Patriot groups: "Patriot groups define themselves as opposed to the 'New World Order,' engage in groundless conspiracy theorizing, or advocate or adhere to extreme antigovernment doctrines."\par \par \uc2 "Listing here," the center said, "does not imply that the groups themselves advocate or engage in violence or other criminal activities, or are racist."\par \par \uc2 The center began tracking another category, what it calls "nativist extremist" groups, after the Minuteman movement exploded in the mid-2000s. These groups distinguish themselves from regular anti-illegal-immigration opinion by directly confronting suspected illegal immigrants at the border, at day-labor centers or elsewhere, Beirich said.\par \par \uc2 The number of active groups in this category hit a peak of 319 in 2010 before declining to 184 last year, the center says.\par \par \uc2 Infighting, bad press and co-opting of the movement has driven its decline, Beirich said. Groups such as the Arizona-based Minuteman Civil Defense Corps, once the best known of this category, splintered and dissolved. The arrest of one-time Minuteman Shawna Forde, for murdering an Arivaca man and his daughter in 2009, also drove people away.\par \par \uc2 Most important, Beirich said, anti-\uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2  actions were taken up by state legislatures and absorbed as a major concern by groups such as the tea parties and the Republican Party. Many people who once concerned themselves with border-watch activities moved on to the broader concerns of the tea-party movement, she said.\par \par \uc2 Another concern was safety as Mexico's drug traffickers raised their level of violence, said Al Garza, a one-time leader of the Minuteman Civil Defense Corps.\par \par \uc2 "For anyone on this side to make a stand against them would be foolish," he said.\par \par \uc2 Garza's experience also traced the arc of the border-watch movement. He left the Minuteman Civil Defense Corps in 2009 to form a separate group called the Patriots Coalition but now informally consults with tea-party groups and others who share his concerns about the border and rule of law, Garza said.\par \par \uc2 Contact reporter Tim Steller at 807-8427 or tsteller@azstarnet.com\par \par \uc2 Document TUCS000020120413e83i0000l\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 ACCENT\par {\*\bkmkstart toc96}{\*\bkmkend toc96}\b \uc2 Who's who of authors will grace book festival\b0\par\par\uc2 ANN BROWN   \par \uc2 ANN BROWN, ARIZONA DAILY STAR\par \uc2 2,104 \uc2 words\par \uc2 5 February 2012\par \uc2 The Arizona Daily Star\par \uc2 TUCS\par \uc2 FINAL\par E1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2012 The Arizona Daily Star.

And prolific novelists such as T.C. Boyle ("When the Killing's Done"), Alice Hoffman ("The Dovekeepers") and Lisa See ("Dreams of Joy"), whose literary fiction swooped to the top of best-sellers lists.\par \par \uc2 The authors and 255 exhibitors' tents and booths will fill the University of Arizona Mall and adjacent lecture halls and meeting rooms March 10-11. A crowd of 100,000 people is expected for the community event.\par \par \uc2 "Book festivals are so much fun," said See, who is participating in Tucson's festival for the first time. From the person pushing a baby stroller to people in their in 80s, See said, book festivals bring like-minded people together.\par \par \uc2 Festivals are also an opportunity to see different books and hear or find a favorite author, said See.\par \par \uc2 The book festival has "a great reputation among writers," said Hoffman, who will be attending her second book festival. Authors like that the Tucson Festival of Books is well-attended and that there "is so much going on."\par \par \uc2 "It's also an opportunity to touch base with other great writers," said author and UA creative writing program professor Aurelie Sheehan.\par \par \uc2 Russo, attending the festival for the first time, said one of the reasons he wanted to be here was the chance to listen to and talk with Luis Albert Urrea, who will be the keynote speaker at the annual Author's Table Dinner March 9.\par \par \uc2 "It's great to have authors with national reputations and deep literary connections come here to share their work with our students and our community," said Sheehan, author of two novels and a short- story collection. The festival connects writers with passionate readers across the country.\par \par \uc2 To be able to sit and listen to a writer, to hear an author's work in his or her voice, gives you "a sense of their person, their character," said Sheehan.\par \par \uc2 Here's a glimpse at four authors whom you might want to get to know better during the festival:\par \par \uc2 T.C. Boyle\par \par \uc2 Tom Coraghessan Boyle always knew he was destined for greatness, so a name like "Thomas John" given by his parents just wouldn't do.\par \par \uc2 At 17 he ditched convention and changed his middle name to Coraghessan (pronounced "kuh-RAGG-issun"), a name extracted from his Irish ancestry.\par \par \uc2 Boyle just wasn't sure where that greatness lay.\par \par \uc2 When he entered the State University of New York at Potsdam after high school, he planned a music career, but failed his saxophone audition for the school's music program. He eventually wrote a play for a class and became enamored with writing.\par \par \uc2 He bounced around after college but ended up in the writers' workshop and M.F.A. program at the University of Iowa, from which he also received a Ph.D. in 19th-century British literature.\par \par \uc2 Boyle, known for wearing red Converse high-tops, fictionalizes unorthodox views of slices of American history and life: hippies, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  couple living near a hoity-toity Los Angeles neighborhood, his own substance abuse.\par \par \uc2 He views anything as a possible topic, he said from his home, a Frank Lloyd Wright house near Santa Barbara. His home and the research that surrounded its restoration were some of the source materials for "The Women," which retells the architect's life through stories of wives and mistresses.\par \par \uc2 Boyle returns to one of his favorite themes - environmental and ecological issues - with "When the Killing's Done," the story of a biologist and an animal-rights advocate with opposing viewpoints on what's best for the Northern Channel Islands near Santa Barbara.\par \par \uc2 The book was inspired by a newspaper article, which he still has on his refrigerator, with the headline "Eagles arrive as pigs are killed," referring to the reintroduction of the bald eagle on the islands and the eradication of the feral pig.\par \par \uc2 Boyle said the book ultimately asks questions such as, "Why should native species be preserved over others?" and "Who gets to decide the fate of these species?"\par \par \uc2 And here's a fun fact: He was married at the Yuma Territorial Prison.\par \par \uc2 Alice Hoffman\par \par \uc2 Readers expect Hoffman to conjure up magic, strong female protagonists and empowering feminist themes.\par \par \uc2 Her latest book is a bit of a departure: "The Dovekeepers" is an ambitious, multi-faceted story that traces the lives and interactions of six women at Masada during the Roman siege in the first century.\par \par \uc2 "I've written historical novels before ... but this was a huge undertaking. Bigger. More complicated," said Hoffman while vacationing in Florida late last month. The book took her five years to write, she said.\par \par \uc2 "I didn't expect to write this book," she said, "but children lead you to certain places." Her son, an anthropologist, was in Israel on digs. She'd visited Israel before, but never Masada. A visit to the site was the inspiration for her book.\par \par \uc2 "For me, everyone has a voice ... a unique voice," said Hoffman. In "The Dovekeepers" acknowledgments, Hoffman notes that the novel is meant to "give voice" to the women who participated in the Jewish struggle.\par \par \uc2 Richard Russo\par \par \uc2 Russo is often described as a writer of place whose vivid descriptions seem to make small towns a character in his richly detailed, textured novels.\par \par \uc2 Not so, said Russo. "I write of class."\par \par \uc2 He said his settings - usually based on his hometown of Gloversville in upstate New York - are so vivid because he's able to capture working-class rhythms. "Empire Falls," winner of the 2002 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, was set in a small town in Maine in which its mill, the once economic driver, closed.\par \par \uc2 Russo grew up in a blue-collar household and came to the UA, where he received a bachelor's in English and his Ph.D. in American literature in 1980. He backtracked and earned a master's of fine arts in creative writing in 1981. Russo will also take part in events celebrating the Creative Writing MFA's 40th anniversary.\par \par \uc2 "I was a "small-town boy running away from a cold place that was full of winter and filled with dirty snow. ... I was full of 'go West young man,' " he said last month from his Boston apartment. He and his wife also have a home in Maine.\par \par \uc2 Even though he spent about 15 years here, you won't see Tucson in an upcoming Russo novel. "I always felt like a tourist or interloper in Arizona," he said. "The rhythm of life there is bizarre to me, different from other places."\par \par \uc2 Despite being a fish out of water culturally and politically, Russo said Arizona was good to him - he met his wife of almost 40 years - and Tucson has a soft spot in his heart.\par \par \uc2 He's taking a new literary path this fall, when his memoir will be released. It will be the first time he's written about his hometown and used its name. He's also working on a screenplay for Bill Bryson's "A Walk in the Woods," a memoir of walking the Appalachian Trail.\par \par \uc2 Lisa See\par \par \uc2 See follows the cardinal rule of writers - she writes about what she knows.\par \par \uc2 And then some.\par \par \uc2 Research is intrinsic to See's rich, deeply detailed exploration of Chinese culture and characters in books such as "Shanghai Girls," the tale of two very different sisters in 1937 Shanghai when it is bombed by Japan, and the follow-up, "Dreams of Joy." Critics praise her depth of knowledge that gives her novels authenticity as well as a sense of time and place.\par \par \uc2 "Even if you think you know everything, there's a lot you don't know," See said late last month from her home near Los Angeles.\par \par \uc2 See learned the pleasures and surprises of research while earning a bachelor's degree in the humanities at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles.\par \par \uc2 She spends a great deal of time in the UCLA library scouring published and unpublished manuscripts trying to put herself and the reader into her characters' shoes.\par \par \uc2 See grew up in a large Chinese-American family. Her great-great- grandfather came to the United States to work on the transcontinental railroad. Her great-grandfather was the patriarch of Los Angeles Chinatown. Her first book, "On Gold Mountain," traced her great-grandfather's journey.\par \par \uc2 See was grand marshal of this year's New Year's parade in Los Angeles Chinatown, which ended at the place where her grandparents had a family store. "It was so touching to be so close."\par \par \uc2 See has also written three mystery-thrillers featuring the team of David Stark and Liu Hula, and she wrote the libretto for the opera based on "On Gold Mountain."\par \par \uc2 Though an opera fan, she'd never written a libretto - and probably won't again, she said.\par \par \uc2 She began writing the libretto as she does writing a book - with research. She went to an opera shop in the Los Angeles area, bought three of her favorite librettos and studied them.\par \par \uc2 The difference was the team-effort approach with the libretto. With a novel, she's alone in her office, but with the libretto she would sit with the composer at the piano as he played music.\par \par \uc2 See is working on "China Dolls," which deals with Chinese- American nightclubs in the 1930s and '40s.\par \par \uc2 "Even though I write about the Chinese-American experience," said See, "what I am really writing about is mothers and daughters, friends, relationships and emotions that are universal."\par \par \uc2 Contact reporter Ann Brown at abrown@azstarnet.com\par \par \uc2 Next Sunday in !Vamos!\par \par \uc2 Romance and mystery at the Tucson Festival of Books.\par \par \uc2 4th annual Tucson Festival of Books\par \par \uc2 * When: 9 a.m.-5:30 p.m. March 10-11.\par \par \uc2 * Where: University of Arizona campus.

But he acknowledged that's not likely, urging Congress to at least help children of illegal immigrants who are committed to going to college or joining the military, a concept known as the Dream Act.\par \par \uc2 Obama said there are "hundreds of thousands of talented, hardworking students" who face the harsh reality of not being U.S. citizens.\par \par \uc2 Obama also advocated for the Dream Act concept in his 2011 speech with a message that closely resembled this year's. Obama did not mention the topic in State of the Union speeches in 2009 and 2010.\par \par \uc2 The Dream Act would grant legal status to illegal immigrants who came to the U.S. before age 16, have been here at least five years, have not committed a felony and are set to enroll in college or the military.\par \par \uc2 The legislation has been on Congress' radar for nearly a decade. In late 2010, the act passed the Democratic-controlled House but it died in the Senate.\par \par \uc2 The legislation has become an issue in the race for the Republican presidential bid. During Monday's GOP debate in Florida, Newt Gingrich said he would veto the version of the Dream Act that gave a path to citizenship for children of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  parents who compete college. But he said illegal immigrants should be able to gain citizenship if they serve in the military. Mitt Romney, who had previously said he would veto the Dream Act, said he would take the same position on military service.\par \par \uc2 Obama's advocacy for the Dream Act concept comes as his administration is doing a case-by-case review of about 300,000 pending deportation cases nationwide in search of people who warrant reprieves. Included in the 19 factors that will be taken into consideration are having been brought here illegally as a child, and if a person is a high school graduate pursuing a college degree.\par \par \uc2 Critics call the current review of pending deportations backdoor amnesty, but Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials say no one group will be given categorical relief. Reprieves will be determined case-by-case, the agency says.\par \par \uc2 The review is an effort to unburden the nation's overcrowded immigration courts and free up Immigration and Customs Enforcement to focus on illegal immigrants with criminal convictions who pose a threat to communities.\par \par \uc2 Contact reporter Brady McCombs at 573-4213 or bmccombs@azstarnet.com.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Number trying to migrate illegally more than once a year is declining\par \par \uc2 Fewer illegal immigrants are crossing the border multiple times in a single year, never-before-released government numbers show.\par \par \uc2 The percentage of people apprehended two or more times by the Border Patrol within the same fiscal year - known as the recidivism rate - has declined each of the last four years, shows a new report from the Congressional Research Service. The rate was 20 percent in fiscal 2011, down from 28 percent in fiscal 2007, the report says.\par \par \uc2 The decline is the latest indicator that the flow of illegal immigrants has slowed. That could mean illegal crossers who pay smugglers to take them across the border can't afford to try again, or that in a time of recession and tougher penalties for U.S. companies that hire illegal workers, fewer people find it worth the risk to come here seeking work.\par \par \uc2 The new report is the first public accounting of how many people cross the border repeatedly. The Border Patrol shares data on its total apprehensions each year but does not say how many people those numbers represent.\par \par \uc2 The report also reveals that nearly 60 percent of apprehended border crossers are being sent home through programs intended to make it tougher for them to cross again, and that fewer than 1 percent of all people apprehended by the Border Patrol have been convicted of major crimes.\par \par \uc2 Fingerprint database\par \par \uc2 Individual illegal immigrants are caught fewer times on average, the report shows.\par \par \uc2 Each \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  apprehended by the Border Patrol in fiscal 2011 was caught an average of 1.27 times - down from an average of 1.63 times in fiscal 2000, the report shows. That's a 22 percent decrease.\par \par \uc2 The recidivism calculations were possible because agencies within the Department of Homeland Security provided the Congressional Research Service's Specialist in Immigration Policy, Marc Rosenblum, with the number of "unique" individuals captured each year.\par \par \uc2 This number is calculated by running each person's fingerprints through a Homeland Security database that has been used at all Border Patrol stations since the end of 1999.\par \par \uc2 Rosenblum's report, "Border Security: Immigration Enforcement Between Ports of Entry," shows that about 269,000 people were apprehended in fiscal year 2011. Total apprehensions - incidents, not individuals - that year were 340,252. In fiscal 2000, about 880,000 people were apprehended compared to about 1.43 million apprehensions that were entered into the fingerprint database, the report shows.\par \par \uc2 The numbers, of course, do not account for repeat crossers who made it across the border, or who were caught in subsequent years.\par \par \uc2 The report is the latest metric indicating that the flow of illegal immigrants, especially from Mexico, has slowed:\par \par \uc2 * Border Patrol apprehensions along the U.S.-Mexico border plummeted to levels not seen since 1972 in the recently completed fiscal year.\par \par \uc2 * The number of people leaving Mexico dropped by 60 percent from 2006 to 2010, according to a July report from the Pew Hispanic Center based on analysis of Mexican government data.\par \par \uc2 * The number of illegal immigrants living in the United States has dropped to an estimated 11.2 million from a peak of 12 million in 2007, according to a February 2011 report from the Pew Hispanic Center.\par \par \uc2 Many immigration analysts say the U.S. recession is the most likely cause of the slowdown. Customs and Border Protection leaders agree that's part of it, but say the fact that apprehensions have been on the decline since before the recession began shows that the two-decade-long buildup of agents, barriers, roads and technology across the border is working.\par \par \uc2 Border Patrol spokesman Michael Friel said that with apprehensions at historic lows, the agency is analyzing recidivism and other border enforcement data to better understand cross-border activity and determine how to improve border security.\par \par \uc2 "We have begun looking at recidivism to see what conclusions we can make in terms of this agency's impact on an individual's determination to cross the border illegally," Friel wrote in an statement.\par \par \uc2 Few serious criminals\par \par \uc2 Since 2005, the Border Patrol has tracked how many people they apprehend are in the FBI's criminal database.\par \par \uc2 The percentage who appeared in that database with convictions for "major" crimes hovered between 1.5 and 2.5 percent from 2005-2010, but fell below 1 percent in 2011, the Congressional Research Center report shows.\par \par \uc2 Major crimes include murder, assault, kidnapping, robbery, sexual assault and dangerous drugs, the report says.\par \par \uc2 A total of 90,700 people with major-crime convictions in the U.S. were apprehended by the Border Patrol from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2011 (excluding 2009, when a software error prevented the agency from recording the data).\par \par \uc2 The figure backs previous research suggesting illegal immigrants are no more likely to commit violent crimes than U.S. citizens.\par \par \uc2 Data from the U.S. Sentencing Commission cited in another Congressional Research Center report indicate that violent crimes made up less than 1 percent of crimes committed by noncitizens in 2009, compared to 5 percent among U.S. citizens.\par \par \uc2 Noncitizens, a category that also includes legal permanent residents, accounted for 7 percent of the 2.4 million people incarcerated in U.S. federal, state and local jails in 2009, according to a previous report by the Congressional Research Center. That's about the same percentage of noncitizens in the U.S. population.\par \par \uc2 harsher consequences\par \par \uc2 Border Patrol leaders announced this week that the cornerstone of their new national strategy is a "consequence delivery system," that ramps up the consequences of being caught crossing the border illegally.\par \par \uc2 One such program is "Operation Streamline," which threatens anyone who crosses in a designated zone with a federal criminal conviction and jail time. That used to happen only to repeat crossers and those with criminal records.\par \par \uc2 Being in the U.S. illegally is a civil violation, not a criminal offense, so apprehended crossers typically were just dropped off at the border. But now more border crossers are being charged with criminal illegal entry before being returned to their home countries.\par \par \uc2 In fiscal 1999, 1 percent of illegal border crossers apprehended faced criminal charges or formal removals. By fiscal 2010, that number had soared to 58 percent.\par \par \uc2 Contact reporter Brady McCombs at 573-4213 or bmccombs@azstarnet.com\par \par \uc2 On StarNet: To read the entire Congressional Research Service report, go to azstarnet.com/pdf\par \par \uc2 Document TUCS000020120210e81m0003x\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 NEWS\par {\*\bkmkstart toc99}{\*\bkmkend toc99}\b \uc2 Once welcoming, borderlands now forever divided\b0\par\par\uc2 BRADY MCCOMBS   \par \uc2 BRADY MCCOMBS, ARIZONA DAILY STAR\par \uc2 912 \uc2 words\par \uc2 11 December 2011\par \uc2 The Arizona Daily Star\par \uc2 TUCS\par \uc2 FINAL\par A1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2011 The Arizona Daily Star.

Between the ports, most flimsy, barbed-wire cattle fences have been replaced by hulking steel walls or chest-high vehicle barriers made of railroad ties.\par \par \uc2 It's tougher than ever to cross, legally or illegally. And that has altered the borderlands for people who live, visit, ranch or own businesses there.\par \par \uc2 The transformation can be traced to several changes over the last two decades:\par \par \uc2 * A mid-1990s security push beefed up enforcement in Texas and California, funneling smuggling of people and drugs into Southern Arizona. The idea was that the harsh desert and deadly heat would be a natural deterrent. It wasn't, and Arizona has been the border's busiest smuggling corridor since the late 1990s.\par \par \uc2 * The terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, shifted the nation's focus to homeland security. Lines into the U.S. grew as customs officers faced increased pressure to keep terrorists from entering the country.\par \par \uc2 * As illegal immigrants put down roots rather than cross back and forth, the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  population in the U.S. swelled to 10 million-plus in the mid-2000s. A historic buildup of agents, fences, roads, highway checkpoints and technology followed. Five times the number of Border Patrol agents now work the Southwest border than in 1992. The parent agency's nearly $12 billion budget is double what it was the first year after Homeland Security was created in 2004.\par \par \uc2 * In early 2007, newly elected Mexican President Felipe Calderon launched a crackdown on Mexican drug smuggling organizations that led to an era of bloodshed. Pinched by the pressure, cartels warred for prized corridors and against government forces trying to weaken them. As drug-related murders spiked, security fears cut into visits by Americans to Mexico and sparked U.S. State Department travel warnings for Mexico.\par \par \uc2 * In 2009 the Obama administration escalated checks of vehicles and people leaving the U.S. for Mexico, trying to stop the flow of guns, ammo and cash that fuel the cartels.\par \par \uc2 * In March 2010, Cochise County rancher Robert Krentz was found slain on his ranch northeast of Douglas. The case remains unsolved, but it's suspected he was killed by a smuggler. Many say the event helped Gov. Jan Brewer pass Arizona's tough new immigration law, SB 1070, a few months later.\par \par \uc2 Because of all these changes, ports of entry that used to feel like rotating gates monitored by security guards are now hardened checkpoints. In addition to border walls and fences, wide dirt roads run parallel on much of the U.S. side, with lights and camera towers in urban areas.\par \par \uc2 Mountains, valleys and canyons that were a playground for hikers, birders and hunters have been scarred by illegal border crossers and the federal agents chasing them. Ranchers who used to tip their hats to illegal border crossers now carry high-powered rifles, fearful of possible encounters with smugglers.\par \par \uc2 The borderlands remain home to thousands who still live rich lives there - but some of what made them so special before is gone, probably forever.\par \par \uc2 Contact reporter Brady McCombs at 573-4213 or bmccombs@azstarnet.com\par \par \uc2 more Inside\par \par \uc2 Family then\par \par \uc2 The Denhams chose to raise a family in Douglas, and never regretted it.\par \par \uc2 Family now\par \par \uc2 Teen Jennifer Majalca warned about lure of easy money for smuggling.\par \par \uc2 Part one of a five-part series exploring changes on the U.S.- Mexico border.\par \par \uc2 Monday: Ranching\par \par \uc2 Tuesday: The wall\par \par \uc2 Wednesday: Recreation\par \par \uc2 Thursday: Business\par \par \uc2 On StarNet: Brady McCombs will chat with readers about the series at noon Thursday.
