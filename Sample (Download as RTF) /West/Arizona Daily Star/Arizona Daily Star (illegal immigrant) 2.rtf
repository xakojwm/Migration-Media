Adicionalmente, Rothschild recaudo mas dinero que Grinnell.\par \par \uc2 La primera tarea de Rothschild sera restaurar la confianza en el gobierno local, que ha disminuido por el malgasto de dinero de Rio Nuevo, serios problemas con el sistema de 911, negocios cuestionables respecto al desarrollo del centro y robos en el programa de estacionamiento.\par \par \uc2 Mediante un plan de 180 dias, Rothschild prometio iniciar discusiones con empresas y designar a alguien en su oficina que funja como enlace con los pequenos empresarios.\par \par \uc2 En el discurso que pronuncio en una alegre celebracion democrata, Rothschild dijo que esta listo para trabajar jornadas de 14 horas y que va a convertir la oficina del Alcalde en la "maquinaria" que movilizara su plan.\par \par \uc2 Rothschild senalo que los desafios que enfrenta la ciudad son graves, como el envejecimiento de la infraestructura, una pobreza extrema y un sistema educativo que necesita mejoramientos.\par \par \uc2 Tom Volgy, un antiguo alcalde democrata que apoya a Rothschild, dijo que mensajes por el estilo en su campana le ayudaron a cortejar a los votantes.\par \par \uc2 "Esta claro que se dirigio a lo que los tucsonenses realmente quieren -una fuerte direccion, un enfasis en la economia y un alcalde activista que abogara por opciones viables".\par \par \uc2 Grinnell dijo que habia anticipado una carrera mas aguerrida, pero felicito a sus voluntarios por el gran esfuerzo que realizaron.\par \par \uc2 "No hay perdedores en este proceso", comento en una entrevista. Grinnell dijo que de todas formas continuara involucrado en la politica local.\par \par \uc2 "Es ironico, porque continuare participando de una forma u otra - ya sea como alcalde o en la Mesa Directiva de Rio Nuevo. Seguire en esto".\par \par \uc2 En Mesa, y a lo largo del estado, los criticos de Pearce celebraron su revocacion.\par \par \uc2 La primera eleccion de este tipo contra un legislador estatal en Arizona fue promovida por los detractores de Pearce, liderados por el grupo Ciudadanos por una mejor Arizona.\par \par \uc2 Pearce intentaba retener su escano por la localidad de Mesa frente a Lewis, pero finalmente se impuso el segundo con un 53 por ciento de apoyo frente al 45 por ciento de su rival, segun los resultados divulgados por la prensa local el Miercoles 9 de Noviembre.\par \par \uc2 El Martes 8 por la noche Pearce acepto la derrota en una comparecencia en la que estuvo acompanado por el alguacil del Condado Maricopa, Joe Arpaio, conocido por sus redadas antiinmigrantes.\par \par \uc2 En Julio pasado, las autoridades electorales del Condado certificaron mas de 10 mil del total de firmas recolectadas, y el grupo solo necesitaba un minimo de siete mil 756 para que Pearce se sometiera a voto.\par \par \uc2 Criticos de Pearce argumentaron que la obsesion del Senador con la inmigracion ilegal le ha hecho olvidar las urgencias economicas y educativas del estado, cuya imagen se ha visto danada por la SB 1070.\par \par \uc2 La agencia EFE contribuyo a esta nota.\par \par \uc2 Democrat Jonathan Rothschild will be Tucson's new mayor after he won 55 percent of the vote to Republican Rick Grinnell's 40 percent in the city's election.\par \par \uc2 And in the races for City Council Ward One, council member Regina Romero defeated Green Party challenger Beryl Baker. In Ward Two, Councilman Paul Cunningham, appointed to fill a vacant seat on the council last year, won a full term, defeating Republican challenger Jennifer Rawson.\par \par \uc2 But the biggest election result ocurred in Mesa Arizona where state Senator Russell Pearce was removed from office by voters in Legislative District 18.\par \par \uc2 Pearce, the controversial legislator who was the force behind many of the state's anti-\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  laws, including SB 1070, will be replaced by Republican Jerry Lewis.\par \par \uc2 In Tucson, Rothschild's win didn't come as a surprise to most political observers because of the Democratic voter advantage over Republicans. Additionally, Rothschild raised more money than Grinnell.\par \par \uc2 Rothschild's first task will be to help restore trust in city government, which has been sorely tested given wasteful Rio Nuevo spending, serious glitches in the 911 system, questionable development deals downtown and thefts in the parking program.\par \par \uc2 In a 180-day plan, Rothschild pledged to launch discussions with business interests and establish a small-business liaison in the mayor's office.\par \par \uc2 Speaking at a joyful Democratic celebration at the Lodge on the Desert midtown hotel, Rothschild said he's ready to begin 14-hour days, saying he'd make the mayor's office "an engine room" to accomplish his plan.\par \par \uc2 Rothschild said the challenges facing the city are stark, from aging infrastructure to deep poverty and an education system that needs improvement. "Tomorrow morning, the real work begins."\par \par \uc2 Tom Volgy, a Rothschild ally and former Democratic mayor, said that kind of talk on the campaign trail helped Rothschild woo voters.\par \par \uc2 "It's clear that Jonathan appealed clearly to what Tucsonans really want and need - a stronger sense of direction, a stronger economic focus, and an emphasis on an activist mayor who will pursue real viable options for us."\par \par \uc2 Grinnell said he had anticipated a closer race, but complimented his volunteers for a strong effort. "There are no losers in this process," he said in an interview.\par \par \uc2 Grinnell said he'll still continue to be engaged in Tucson politics anyway.\par \par \uc2 "The irony is, I'm still involved one way or the other - either as mayor or on the Rio Nuevo Board.

Mendez bought just one gun but did so alongside one of the lead defendants, Carlos Armando Celaya, who bought 21 guns that day in March 2007.\par \par \uc2 As recently as Monday, Assistant U.S. Attorney Laura Gwinn and defense attorney John Kaufmann appeared in federal court as U.S. District Judge David Bury decided pretrial motions.\par \par \uc2 Gwinn, a Justice Department prosecutor from Washington, D.C., said in a document filed Thursday that she spoke with a co- defendant about Mendez after a recent plea deal was signed. That co- defendant - whom Kaufmann identified as Celaya - said Mendez was not part of the gun-trafficking conspiracy and had bought the gun for himself, Gwinn said in the filing.\par \par \uc2 Bury dismissed the case with prejudice, meaning it cannot be refiled.\par \par \uc2 Celaya pleaded guilty Oct. 12 to conspiring to illegally export firearms, making false statements and providing a firearm to an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . In the plea agreement, he acknowledged being part of a group that bought 282 firearms for buyers in Mexico, including his cousin in Sonora.\par \par \uc2 The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee is investigating Operation Fast and Furious, in which about 2,000 firearms were sold to people intending to sell them to criminals in Mexico.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Road to citizenship points him toward social-justice work\par \par \uc2 The immigration judge's question was simple: "Why should I let you stay?"\par \par \uc2 Leo Guardado had arrived illegally in Los Angeles as a 9-year- old boy, fleeing with his mother from their war-torn village in El Salvador. But by 2001 he was a college freshman, tired of hiding his immigration status from classmates and professors. And he was painfully aware that without a green card, he wouldn't be able work legally no matter how many degrees he earned.\par \par \uc2 So he and his mother decided to emerge from the shadows and seek legal sanctuary.\par \par \uc2 "I volunteer, I'm involved in the school, I'm involved in community, I do service, I'm going to college," Guardado told the judge. "I don't have a criminal record. I don't plan on having one. I will pay taxes when I actually can work."\par \par \uc2 He told judge Henry Ipema that he had finished second in his class at a prestigious Catholic high school in Los Angeles and earned a full scholarship to St. Mary's College of California. He laid out his life plan if allowed to stay in the U.S.\par \par \uc2 "I'll be a model citizen in ways that many citizens aren't," Guardado said. "I've proven that already without being a citizen."\par \par \uc2 In a rare occurrence in the U.S. immigration system, the judge granted them political asylum, and legal residency.\par \par \uc2 "He could have easily said, 'Great story, I feel for you but you've broken the law, please go back to El Salvador,' " Guardado said. "My future would have been vastly different."\par \par \uc2 In the decade since that decisive day - Dec. 22, 2001 - Guardado has lived up to the promise he made the judge. And his journey from the lush mountains of El Salvador through California, Indiana, New York and Europe has now brought him to Tucson.\par \par \uc2 At 29, he is the social ministry director at Most Holy Trinity Catholic Church, 1300 N. Greasewood Road.\par \par \uc2 An articulate, thoughtful and compassionate young man who is open about sharing his story as a former undocumented immigrant, Guardado seems out of central casting as an emerging leader in the nation's hot spot for border and immigration issues.\par \par \uc2 When faith-based leaders were deciding whether to offer sanctuary to a Tucson man facing deportation earlier this month, the Rev. Bill Remmel of the Most Holy Trinity Catholic Church gave Guardado a seat at the table.\par \par \uc2 "I really trust his judgment," Remmel said. "He's got such a good head on his shoulders."\par \par \uc2 Yet Guardado may be gone just as Tucson gets to know him. He is seriously considering life as a Trappist monk at a California monastery where he spent 10 months in 2005-2006.\par \par \uc2 Salvadoran childhood\par \par \uc2 A life of solitude and stillness may seem a peculiar choice for a man who has built his career on helping others. To understand the draw, you must go back to his childhood in the tiny village of Canton Tobias in northwest El Salvador.\par \par \uc2 Tucked into a mountainous region of El Salvador known as Chalatenango, Guardado's village of about 100 people was a place of peaceful jungles and a bloody civil war.\par \par \uc2 He climbed trees and swam in rivers. He enjoyed a simple life without running water or electricity. But he is haunted by memories of bodies in the street.\par \par \uc2 When he was nearing his 10th birthday - the age at which the guerrillas and government army were drafting boys - he and his mother fled.\par \par \uc2 Of their 26-day trek to Los Angeles, Guardado says he remembers "vignettes, not the entire narrative." He recalls walking under the moonlight, cramming into a fake compartment in a semitrailer and crossing a river by raft in the dark.\par \par \uc2 Once they crossed the border, they no longer had to walk in the moonlight - but their life in the shadows was just beginning.\par \par \uc2 Guardado could say two things in English when he arrived in this country: sorry and thank you.\par \par \uc2 A fast learner and a diligent student, he was fluent in English within 1 1/2 years, said his mother, Maria Guardado. Just as he had done in El Salvador, he earned straight As in school.\par \par \uc2 His potential caught the eye of Louis Moret, a prominent figure in the Democratic Party in Los Angeles who employed Maria Guardado to clean his house and help take care of his children.\par \par \uc2 Moret helped get Guardado into Cathedral High, a private all- boys Catholic school. Guardado never told anyone there that he had no Social Security number, and he made excuses when invited to represent the school at a youth gathering in England. He formed a profound but angry relationship with God, who he felt had set him up for so much success that would only be followed by failure.\par \par \uc2 "That cut at a deep level," he said.\par \par \uc2 Facing long odds to attend college because he didn't qualify for federal aid or in-state tuition, he set out a plan: Apply to wealthy, private liberal-arts colleges that wouldn't care about his immigration status and would have scholarships to fund his education.\par \par \uc2 It worked.\par \par \uc2 He was offered a full ride to Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania and St. Mary's College of California. The deciding factor: St. Mary's had a chapel open 24 hours a day.\par \par \uc2 "There's something beautiful to me about going into a church at 2 in the morning, and just being for a few minutes," he said.\par \par \uc2 Compassion runs deep\par \par \uc2 Compassion is deeply rooted in Guardado.\par \par \uc2 As a boy in El Salvador, he asked his mother for money, then walked over and gave it to a man without a leg.\par \par \uc2 In Los Angeles, he put pieces of tortilla in his backpack and fed them to stray dogs in the neighborhood.\par \par \uc2 "I don't think that desire to keep helping will ever die," his mother said in Spanish.\par \par \uc2 Guardado says he's drawn to social-justice work and ministry because he knows what it's like to need help from strangers - and get it.\par \par \uc2 "When you are a recipient of generosity on some level it creates a kinship moment with individuals who also might need help in your future," Guardado said. "That's not the kind of thing you forget."\par \par \uc2 He earned a bachelor's degree in religious studies from St. Mary's and a master's in theology from Notre Dame. In between, he spent a year in New York City, working with inner-city kids through the Lasallian Volunteer Program.\par \par \uc2 In 2008, he took a job in campus ministry at St. Mary's. But he became disillusioned when the college laid off janitors and other staff workers during the recession.\par \par \uc2 He knows a higher-paying field would help his mother, who is 60 years old and still cleans houses. But, he says of a corporate job, internally "it's not going to feed me."\par \par \uc2 Seeking inner peace\par \par \uc2 While he was still at St. Mary's, Guardado led student trips to the border. That's how he met the Rev. Remmel, who saw in Guardado intelligence, a keen grasp of theology - and something more.\par \par \uc2 "There's a tangible quality I can't put a name on," Remmel said. "Anyone I know that's met him seems to be able to immediately relate to him."\par \par \uc2 He has all the traits of an outstanding leader, said the Rev. John Fife, retired pastor at Southside Presbyterian Church and co- founder of the Sanctuary Movement of the 1980s. "Leo's going to make a substantial difference in the world before he's done."\par \par \uc2 Just months from his 30th birthday, Guardado now faces a decision about going to the monastery. Part of his desire is an unexplainable draw to the place, the people and the mystery of God, he says. The other attraction is to the stillness and rhythm of the life.\par \par \uc2 "I grew up climbing trees and swimming in rivers. I grew up playing on my own in the wilderness," he said. "I was then transplanted, to use the imagery, to a cement jungle in Los Angeles."\par \par \uc2 At the monastery, he says, "You till the land, you work the land.

The fiscal year ended on Sept. 30.\par \par \uc2 For the first time in at least four years, Arizona did not lead the nation in deportations, said Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesman Vincent Picard. It's unknown why there was a decrease, he said.\par \par \uc2 More than half of this year's deportees nationwide - nearly 217,000 - had felony or misdemeanor convictions, setting a 10-year high for the percentage of "criminal" illegal immigrants among total deportations, figures show.\par \par \uc2 The 396,906 deportations nationwide in fiscal 2011 represent a small increase from the 392,862 formally returned in fiscal 2010, the stats show. Deportations have ratcheted up under the Obama administration, with more than 389,000 deportations each of the past three years.\par \par \uc2 The 2011 total deportations are more than three times the total deportations made in fiscal 2001, government figures show.\par \par \uc2 The increase shows the agency is making progress in "smart and effective" immigration enforcement, Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director John Morton said.\par \par \uc2 "This comes down to focusing our resources as best we can on our priorities," Morton said. "We continue to hope for comprehensive immigration reform at a national level, working with the Congress, but in the meantime we work with the resources we have, under the laws we have."\par \par \uc2 The Obama administration has taken criticism from both sides of the immigration debate for rising deportation levels.\par \par \uc2 Republican border hawks and critics of the administration's immigration enforcement strategy call the deportation numbers inflated because they include people who voluntarily leave with no penalties and may be able to cross back into the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 Immigrant rights groups contend the government is unfairly targeting illegal immigrants who are not a menace to society, separating families and creating fear in immigrant communities.\par \par \uc2 "It's very worrisome because they are not just numbers, but real people and real families being torn apart," said the Rev. Alison Harrington of Tucson's Southside Presbyterian Church.\par \par \uc2 Lumping in deportees who have committed nonviolent crimes with violent crimes in the "criminal" \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  count is misleading, Harrington said. Some people are deported because of driving without a license or having reentered the United States after deportation, which can be a felony, she said.\par \par \uc2 Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials could not provide a comprehensive list of the crimes committed by deportees included in the criminal category. They also could not say how many of those crimes related to reentering the U.S. after being deported.\par \par \uc2 They only provided fiscal 2011 totals for these four categories:\par \par \uc2 * 1,119 convicted of homicide.\par \par \uc2 * 5,848 convicted of sexual offenses.\par \par \uc2 * 55,653 convicted of drug-related crimes.\par \par \uc2 * 35,927 convicted of driving under the influence.\par \par \uc2 That leaves 118,151 others in the criminal category with unknown crimes.\par \par \uc2 Two-thirds of the "noncriminal" illegal immigrants deported were recent illegal border crossers or repeat immigration violators, the agency said.\par \par \uc2 "The administration and ICE shouldn't be so proud of themselves," said Jennifer Allen, the director of Tucson-based Border Action Network. "Still nearly half of the people that have been taken out of this country have done nothing more than have immigration violations."\par \par \uc2 The total number of criminal illegal immigrants deported in fiscal 2011 was more than double the fiscal 2007 total and more than three times the the fiscal 2001 total.\par \par \uc2 The last time criminal illegal immigrants made up such a large portion was in fiscal 2002 when they accounted for 58 percent of the nearly 123,000 deportations. By comparison, only 31 to 35 percent of deportees were "criminals" in fiscal 2007-2009.\par \par \uc2 The percentage of criminal illegal immigrants in Arizona accounted for half of the total deportations.\par \par \uc2 More than 90 percent of fiscal 2011's deportations fell under Immigration and Customs Enforcement's priority groups: those who have broken criminal laws; recent border crossers; repeat immigration law violators; and fugitives from immigration court.\par \par \uc2 The breakdown of the countries of origin of the deportees was not available Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 Contact reporter Brady McCombs at 573-4213 or bmccombs@azstarnet.com.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The City Council agreed Tuesday to rewrite the rules for the weekly public call to the audience despite contending there's nothing wrong with their current policies that attempt to restrict what people can say.\par \par \uc2 Mayor Bob Walkup announced at the meeting a week ago that he was imposing new restrictions on what speakers can say at meetings, allowing him to prohibit criticism of the council and the city staff in the name of civility.\par \par \uc2 One speaker, anti-\uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2  activist Roy Warden, was cut off from speaking and ejected from the meeting after making a reference to interim City Manager Richard Miranda.\par \par \uc2 This week, Councilman Steve Kozachik asked the council to rewrite the rules after the "unprecedented move" of shutting down speech last week.\par \par \uc2 He said the wording of the city's rule, which prohibits "personal, impertinent or slanderous remarks" or "boisterous" behavior, is too broad. Two First Amendment lawyers interviewed by the Arizona Daily Star last week had similar opinions.\par \par \uc2 Kozachik wanted new rules that mandate a speaker be warned before being cut off, and wanted to change the language to be less broad. "Speech rights come with a cost," he said.\par \par \uc2 He wanted to change the language so that speakers who make "statements which disrupt, disturb or otherwise impede the orderly conduct of the council meeting, including comments that are repetitive in nature, or whose speech reflects a clear and present danger, is obscene, libelous, slanderous or poses an imminent true threat" may be removed from the meeting.\par \par \uc2 City Attorney Mike Rankin said he would take Kozachik's language into consideration when he drafted the new rules, along with the rules and best practices from other cities and towns in Arizona.\par \par \uc2 He defended the city's rules, saying they were consistent with the rules of other Arizona cities and that they have been in place since 1982.\par \par \uc2 "What we can't do and won't do and haven't done is restrict speech based on viewpoint," Rankin said, adding that all the council has done has properly restricted the time, place and manner of speech. "What we have currently is well within the fold."\par \par \uc2 Councilwoman Karin Uhlich said she was "reticent to impose restrictions" on speech, but she said the council shouldn't have to put up with threats of violence or disruption. She said civility is a "core value" of Tucson, and that other attendees at the call to the audience shouldn't have to be "subjected to behavior or verbiage that is out of bounds."\par \par \uc2 Although she is a supporter of the First Amendment, Councilwoman Regina Romero said the council needs to provide a space for citizens where speakers follow rules of propriety and decorum. She said there are rules for behavior in front of children, in schools and even while sitting in traffic, so there are also rules for behavior in council meetings.\par \par \uc2 "We need to be able to provide a place that people feel safe," she said.\par \par \uc2 Walkup said he wants to start giving people warnings before cutting them off, give clearer rules for behaviors, and spell out on the speaker request forms more clearly what behavior is or isn't allowed.\par \par \uc2 The rules need some review and adjustment, Walkup said.\par \par \uc2 Warden, who touched off the controversy when he was cut off last week, spoke at Tuesday's call to the audience and continued his speech from the week before where he talked about Miranda and a lawsuit that he was involved in that the city lost.\par \par \uc2 Walkup let him speak, but after he finished, Walkup told him not to come next week and say the same thing because the city rules do not allow repetitive speech week to week. He warned Warden that he would be cut off if he said the same thing next week.\par \par \uc2 The city's rules do not prevent repetitive speech, however, and after first insisting they did, Walkup later relented after speaking with Rankin.\par \par \uc2 Rankin said Warden would be allowed to come back and make the same comments, at least until the city finalizes its rule changes.\par \par \uc2 Walkup insisted his intervention last week raised the civility of the call to the audience.

But on Tuesday he just said Miranda's name when the mayor cut him off. When Warden continued speaking, Walkup ordered police to remove him from the meeting.\par \par \uc2 Walkup said Warden violated city rules by saying Miranda's name, and he had the right to cut him off before the personal attacks started.\par \par \uc2 "That's what he did last week and that's what he did the week before," Walkup said. "That's where he was headed and I didn't even want him to start that attack."\par \par \uc2 But two First Amendment lawyers said once the council lets citizens speak at its meetings the city has a very limited ability to regulate what they say. They said the wording of the city's rules prohibiting "personal, impertinent or slanderous remarks" or "boisterous" behavior is too vague and too broad to restrict speech.\par \par \uc2 Civility has been a Walkup initiative in the wake of the Jan. 8 shootings, in which six people were killed and 13 where wounded, including U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. He sponsored a Civility Accord signed by nearly 250 mayors at January's U.S. Conference of Mayors, pledging to support more respectful discourse.\par \par \uc2 But until Tuesday Walkup had not made those voluntary principles mandatory for speakers addressing the council.\par \par \uc2 After the mayor read the "new" rules Tuesday, City Attorney Mike Rankin said anyone violating the rules could be ejected from the meeting.\par \par \uc2 Warden, who made his name burning Mexican flags at immigration rallies, objected to the new rules and then pointed at Miranda - who just took over as the city's interim top executive - and started to speak about his involvement in a lawsuit the city lost.\par \par \uc2 But before Warden could continue, Walkup told him his time to speak was over and called in the police when he refused to stop.\par \par \uc2 As Warden was being taken out he questioned whether he was being arrested - he wasn't. He called Miranda an unprintable name as he was being taken away.\par \par \uc2 Warden later said in an email to the Star that he intends to sue over being removed.\par \par \uc2 Defense Attorney Michael Bloom, who has tried several First Amendment cases, said he does not support Warden and finds Warden's "opinions and remarks are frequently disgusting." Still, Bloom said he has "serious concerns about people being silenced and removed from meetings based solely upon the content of their statements."\par \par \uc2 "I don't think that's appropriate and I also don't think it's legal," he said.\par \par \uc2 Bloom, who watched the video of Warden being ejected, noted that under the council's rules, "citizens can be silenced and removed if they make remarks that are 'personal.' "\par \par \uc2 "The Constitution demands that people can only be removed from public meetings for violating clear, objective standards," Bloom said. The council's current standards "are too vague and subjective, and allow people to be removed just because their remarks are unpopular."\par \par \uc2 Dan Barr, attorney for the First Amendment Coalition or Arizona, who also watched the video, said the city's rules "have problems under the First Amendment."\par \par \uc2 Cities don't have to have a call to the audience at their meetings, Barr said, but if they do they can't regulate the content of people's speech. He said the city's rules are "over-broad and vague," calling them more aspirational guidelines than justification for removing speakers from a meeting.\par \par \uc2 The city can limit how long people can speak, and prevent disruptive or unruly speech - such as rampant cursing, disruptions during the meetings, or threats, he said, but not the content of comments.\par \par \uc2 "If you're going to allow a call to the public you can't limit them based on something you disagree with," Barr said. "Is it so vague that civility means agreeing with the City Council?"\par \par \uc2 Rankin said the city rules have been in place for years and are the same as those of many Arizona cities and towns.\par \par \uc2 He said it is up to the mayor to decide what speech doesn't meet the rules, although he said he would step in if the mayor got "too aggressive."\par \par \uc2 Although Warden had not made any personal attacks Tuesday before the mayor cut him off, Rankin said Warden's previous comments were part of the "context" that justified removing him. "It was clear where he was going," Rankin said.\par \par \uc2 This is the second recent incident in which speaker comments at a government hearing have raised questions.\par \par \uc2 Last month a speaker at a Tucson Unified School District meeting had to be told to leave his knife in his vehicle before entering. Once inside, he made a number of inflammatory comments about Hispanics, bloodshed and war that many perceived as threats, and verbally attacked a board member's father.\par \par \uc2 Then-chairman Mark Stegeman was criticized for letting the man continue to speak after warning him to tone it down.\par \par \uc2 Although Warden's past comments have been offensive to many, they didn't include specific threats.\par \par \uc2 Councilman Steve Kozachik initially said he was OK with the mayor's action because "people in the room have a right to a higher level of discourse" than listening to what he called Warden's offensive and racist attacks.\par \par \uc2 But Kozachik later said he wants a study session discussion of the issue because he is concerned about potentially stepping on free- speech rights, although he pointed out he's no supporter of Warden's.\par \par \uc2 Councilwoman Karin Uhlich said bullying or threatening comments can create an environment in which other people don't feel safe.\par \par \uc2 "In this instance, and more broadly in Tucson, there is a concern about dialogue that devolves into threats and personal attacks," she said.\par \par \uc2 Contact reporter Rob O'Dell at 573-4346 or rodell@azstarnet.com\par \par \uc2 On StarNet: Go to azstarnet.com/news/local/govt-and-politics to read more about local and state government and political news.\par \par \uc2 Document TUCS000020111012e79i00024\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 NEWS\par {\*\bkmkstart toc7}{\*\bkmkend toc7}\b \uc2 Immigrant arrests nearing 40-year low\b0\par\par\uc2 BRADY MCCOMBS   \par \uc2 BRADY MCCOMBS, ARIZONA DAILY STAR\par \uc2 1,763 \uc2 words\par \uc2 4 September 2011\par \uc2 The Arizona Daily Star\par \uc2 TUCS\par \uc2 FINAL\par A1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2011 The Arizona Daily Star.

That puts the final year total on pace to be the lowest since 1972, when 321,000 apprehensions were made.\par \par \uc2 By comparison, the agency made 852,500 to 1.6 million apprehensions each year from 1983 to 2007 along the Southwest border before the sharp downturn in the last four years.\par \par \uc2 The precipitous decline is the latest measure to suggest illegal immigration, especially from Mexico, has fallen substantially.\par \par \uc2 The number of people leaving Mexico dropped by 60 percent from 2006 to 2010, according to a July report from the Pew Hispanic Center based on analysis of Mexican government data. The estimated number of illegal immigrants living in the United States has dropped to 11.2 million since reaching a peak of 12 million in 2007, found a February report from the Pew Hispanic Center.\par \par \uc2 Many immigration analysts say the U.S. recession - the worst in a quarter century - is the most likely cause of the slowdown. With fewer jobs available, it's probable would-be crossers are being warned by family and friends already here that the trip north is not worth the money or the peril, said Rey Koslowski, associate professor of political science, public policy and informatics at the University at Albany-SUNY in New York.\par \par \uc2 Federal border officials acknowledge the economy is a factor. However, they note the decline demonstrates that the two-decade- long buildup of agents, barriers, roads and technology across the border - along with the gradual reduction of the old 'catch and release' policy - is working.\par \par \uc2 Apprehensions began decreasing in 2007 before the economic recession began in March 2008, Alan Bersin, U.S. Customs and Border Protection commissioner, points out.\par \par \uc2 The "enforcement posture is greater than we've ever had," Bersin said this week while visiting Tucson. "The results are beginning to show."\par \par \uc2 In its recent report about fewer Mexicans leaving their homeland, the Pew Hispanic Center said factors in both the U.S. and Mexico are likely the cause. The report cited declining job opportunities and increased border enforcement in the U.S., and recent conomic growth in Mexico that may have reduced the "push" factors.\par \par \uc2 In the Tucson Sector - the busiest for illegal border crossings since 1998 - apprehensions are on pace to be as low as 1994, when 139,473 were made. The sector remains the busiest of the nine on the Southwest border, but only accounts for 38 percent of all Southwest border apprehensions this fiscal year, down from 44 percent to 47 percent from 2007 to 2009.\par \par \uc2 Bersin's goal is to see apprehensions in the Tucson Sector below 100,000, which hasn't happened since 1993.\par \par \uc2 He won't go as far as to predict when that will happen, but said it's now a matter of when - not if - arrests will drop that low.\par \par \uc2 "The fat lady hasn't sung in Arizona yet," Bersin said, "but I can hear her tuning up."\par \par \uc2 Imperfect Measurement\par \par \uc2 Using the Border Patrol's apprehensions statistics to gauge illegal immigration rates has been likened to judging a baseball player by his hits without knowing how many times he's been at bat.\par \par \uc2 Because the figures only reflect arrests and not how many people made it into the United States successfully, Koslowski cautions not to put too much stock in the border-arrest figures.\par \par \uc2 "In terms of apprehensions reflecting in any way flows of illegal migrants, it all depends on how many are getting past per apprehension," said Koslowksi, who is also a non-resident fellow at the Migration Policy Institute.\par \par \uc2 This "get-away" figure has historically been vague.\par \par \uc2 Bersin said the estimate he used as U.S. attorney in San Diego in the mid-1990s - that two people get past agents for every one caught - is outdated.\par \par \uc2 With an array of technology, aerial surveillance and more agents than ever, he said, the agency detects far more illegal entries and catches a greater percentage of them.\par \par \uc2 In most parts of the U.S.-Mexico border, including the Yuma, San Diego and El Paso sectors, agents are catching more than 90 percent of illegal crossers, he said.\par \par \uc2 In the Tucson Sector, agents are catching at least 70 percent of them, he said.\par \par \uc2 A rise in what the agency calls the "effectiveness ratio" makes the apprehensions figures more indicative of the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  traffic than in past decades, Bersin said.\par \par \uc2 But the other drawback of using apprehensions as a gauge is that they count the arrest rather than track the person. For example, a person caught three times in one year is tallied as three apprehensions.\par \par \uc2 The Border Patrol tracks how many times each \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  is caught, but that information is not made public.\par \par \uc2 "You have to be very careful about extrapolating in any way the flow of illegal migrants into the country," said Koslowski, noting the arrest data the agency keeps secret.\par \par \uc2 While apprehension rates are an imperfect measure of illegal immigration flow, the slowdown is likely real, said Steve Camarota, director of research for the Center for Immigration Studies, a Washington-based organization that advocates for slowing immigration.\par \par \uc2 The decline began as far back as the summer of 2008, Camarota said, based on his analysis of the U.S. Census Population Survey data.\par \par \uc2 "Fewer folks are coming, and more are leaving," Camarota said. "This means that what was once thought to be inexorable is not."\par \par \uc2 It's important to remember, though, that a slowdown of border crossings may not mean all flow of illegal immigrants has declined proportionately, he said. In 2006, the Pew Hispanic Center estimated that as many as 45 percent of the then-12 million illegal immigrants in the United States overstayed non-immigrant visas after entering through legal ports of entry.\par \par \uc2 More consequences\par \par \uc2 As recently as the mid-2000s, the majority of illegal border crossers were dropped off at the nearest border city, often within hours of their arrest.\par \par \uc2 About four years ago, the Border Patrol ratcheted up its efforts to end this 'catch and return' policy by implementing and expanding a set of programs that levied consequences against more and more illegal border crossers.\par \par \uc2 Some illegal immigrants face a criminal charge of illegal entry in federal court, which could result in jail time. Other arrestees get deported hundreds of miles away from where they were caught in an effort to disrupt the smuggling route. During the summer months, many illegal immigrants are flown home to Mexico City.\par \par \uc2 With the exception of some juveniles and some humanitarian cases, every person caught crossing illegally into Arizona faces some type of consequence today, Bersin said.\par \par \uc2 "We say on the voluntary returns, 'no mas,'" Bersin said. "We are out of the voluntary return business."\par \par \uc2 With fewer arrests, federal officials have been able to prosecute a larger percentage of apprehended illegal immigrants each year since 2006, information from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University shows.\par \par \uc2 Through the first half of fiscal 2011, the Border Patrol had referred 46,125 illegal border crossers for prosecution, which represents 19 percent of total apprehensions made through that time. That was up from 16 percent in fiscal 2010 and 2 percent in fiscal 2006.\par \par \uc2 Bersin considers what he calls the 'consequence delivery system' the fourth pillar of the current border security strategy, along with agents, border barriers and roads and technology.\par \par \uc2 The threat of incarceration or being sent to border states far from where they crossed into the U.S. is absolutely a deterrent for would-be crossers, said Koslowski, the University at Albany professor.\par \par \uc2 "With the tougher border controls, the prices goes up," Koslowski said. "As the cost goes up, fewer will attempt to do it."\par \par \uc2 The Border Patrol wants all would-be crossers to know about the increased consequences.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 But ex-HR boss, in '07 guilty plea, said more than 1,000 were hired\par \par \uc2 Willcox-based tomato-grower \uc2 Eurofresh Inc\uc2 . pleaded guilty Friday to knowingly hiring and continuing to employ "at least 17" illegal immigrants in supervisory-level positions.\par \par \uc2 The company also agreed to pay $600,000 in forfeitures to the federal government over the next five years, and to be on probation until the money is paid.\par \par \uc2 The plea agreement was reached between Eurofresh and the U.S. Attorney's Office after an investigation dating to the past decade into the company's hiring practices. The investigation was conducted by the Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and federal prosecutors.\par \par \uc2 There are contradictory statements about the case, however, between Eurofresh, its plea agreement and its former human- resources director. Those contradictions pertain to how many employees were illegally hired, precisely when that hiring occurred, and whether top Eurofresh officials knew of the illegal hiring at that time, or whether it was done by their then-human-resources director, Kenneth Ward, without their knowledge.\par \par \uc2 Ward pleaded guilty to similar federal charges in 2007 and is awaiting sentencing. In his guilty plea, he alleged that four top company officials, whom he didn't name, knew of the illegal hiring and that the number of employees illegally hired was more than 1,000.\par \par \uc2 But Eurofresh's CEO, \uc2 Johan van den Berg\uc2 , denied all those allegations in response to questions Friday from the Star. Van den Berg said Ward was fired more than four years ago after the company learned he had been bringing in \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  employees without higher officials' knowledge.\par \par \uc2 The new plea agreement says Eurofresh admitted that from about August 2000 until December 2006, the company, through its human- resources director, "engaged in a pattern and practice of hiring or employing unauthorized workers" from Mexico because of labor shortages at the Eurofresh farms. Such shortages are a common problem for commercial farmers in the United States.\par \par \uc2 "This judgment is a message to other employers who engage in illegal practices that there is a real cost to their actions," said U.S. Attorney Dennis K. Burke in a news release Friday.\par \par \uc2 Friday's plea agreement does not say directly whether the company's top management knew of the illegal hirings. It refers only to what it calls the company's "imputed knowledge" of the hirings.\par \par \uc2 In response to questions after the plea agreement was filed in U.S. District Court, however, Eurofresh's van den Berg said the then- human-resources director, Ward, hired those 17 employees without company executives' knowledge. He said the hirings occurred only from 2000 through 2003, three fewer years than the plea agreement said.\par \par \uc2 Eurofresh didn't learn of the illegal hirings until 2006, when it received a Justice Department subpoena regarding hiring practices, van den Berg said in an email to the Star.\par \par \uc2 After that, Eurofresh conducted its own investigation, uncovered wrongdoing by Ward, reported the illegal practices to the Justice Department in 2007 and fired Ward in early 2007, van den Berg said. Ward pleaded guilty four years ago today.\par \par \uc2 But in his own plea agreement, Ward, who started with Eurofresh in July 2000, said that from then until early 2007, he and four executives all conspired to encourage or induce illegal immigrants to reside in this country and to engage in a pattern of illegally employing such immigrants. The company hired more than 1,000 illegal immigrants from August 2000 to December 2006, Ward said then. He said that when Border Patrol officers were in the area of the Eurofresh farms, the majority of the 1,000 employees didn't come to work.\par \par \uc2 In his email to the Star, van den Berg said Ward is the same Kenneth Ward who worked for Eurofresh but that those statements from Ward's plea agreement were "absolutely false."\par \par \uc2 After completing the investigations, the Justice Department found that Eurofresh senior managers at the time the infractions occurred were not involved with them, van den Berg said. Federal officials couldn't be reached Friday on the conflicting statements between Ward and van den Berg.\par \par \uc2 Also in dispute is what Eurofresh's $600,000 in forfeitures represents. The new plea agreement said that payment is to compensate for the money Eurofresh earned from the hiring of 17 illegal immigrants from Mexico over the last decade for supervisory jobs. Van den Berg said later, however, that the company does not agree that the $600,000 is an amount directly related to the violations. Rather, it is a negotiated amount between Eurofresh and the Justice Department, he said.\par \par \uc2 In his comments Friday, van den Berg said all 17 of the illegally hired workers obtained proper work visas and kept working for Eurofresh after the infractions were reported. Nine of those employees still work for Eurofresh while the rest went on to work for other employers, he said.\par \par \uc2 Since the illegal hiring was discovered, Eurofresh has implemented tight systems and regular audits to prevent illegal immigrants from obtaining jobs there, van den Berg told the Star. In addition, the company has for more than three years used the Federal E-Verify system, an electronic system that almost 250,000 companies rely on to ensure that new employees aren't in the U.S. illegally, he said.\par \par \uc2 "The Eurofresh management team is diligent about conducting business with the utmost attention to ethical and legal practices," van den Berg said. "Eurofresh management and leadership teams regret that a former employee conducted these wrongful hiring practices, as we believe it is our duty to demonstrate leadership by example. We will continue to operate with the highest standards in our industry."\par \par \uc2 Contact reporter Tony Davis at tdavis@azstarnet.com or 806-7746.\par \par \uc2 DID YOU KNOW?\par \par \uc2 Eurofresh calls itself this country's leading year-round producer and marketer of greenhouse tomatoes, and says it employs more than 1,100 people and operates on 318 acres in Willcox and Snowflake.\par \par \uc2 Document TUCS000020110921e78r00034\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 TUCSON/REGION\par {\*\bkmkstart toc9}{\*\bkmkend toc9}\b \uc2 Law & Order Briefs\b0\par\par\uc2 ARIZONA DAILY STAR\par \uc2 517 \uc2 words\par \uc2 3 July 2011\par \uc2 The Arizona Daily Star\par \uc2 TUCS\par \uc2 FINAL\par B8\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2011 The Arizona Daily Star.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The two largest wildfires burning in Southern Arizona originated in rugged, mountainous corridors frequently used by cross-border people and drug smugglers.\par \par \uc2 And the U.S. Forest Service has determined that both fires were human-caused.\par \par \uc2 So even though the investigations remain open, speculation is ablaze that illegal immigrants or smugglers are responsible for the Horseshoe 2 Fire northeast of Douglas and the Murphy Complex Fire northwest of Nogales.\par \par \uc2 "It's definitely not caused by somebody on a picnic whose wiener overcooked," resident Brad Titcomb said about the Murphy Fire, which came within a mile of his house in the Aliso Springs neighborhood west of Tubac. "This is illegal traffic one way or another."\par \par \uc2 At a press conference last week, Coronado National Forest supervisor Jim Upchurch said causes of fires include ricocheting bullets, campfires, welding equipment and possibly ignition by smugglers or illegal immigrants. But when asked specifically about the Horseshoe 2 and Murphy Complex fires, Forest Service officials say only that they are human-caused and under investigation.\par \par \uc2 The Horseshoe 2 Fire has burned 128,652 acres in the Chiricahua Mountains - including three homes and six buildings. The Murphy Complex Fire has burned 68,033 acres in the Tumacacori and Atascosa mountains - including the historic Atascosa Lookout.\par \par \uc2 Both rank among the top 10 largest wildfires in Arizona since 1990, shows information from the Southwest Coordination Center, which manages firefighting activities in the Southwest.\par \par \uc2 Don't expect definitive answers on who set the blazes - many human-caused fire cases are never solved.\par \par \uc2 Finding the culprit is daunting for fire investigators, said Pat Schneider, an assistant U.S. attorney in Arizona for the past 20 years who has experience on cases stemming from wildfires including the well-known Rodeo-Chediski Fire of 2002.\par \par \uc2 More than 70 percent of Arizona is federal land and the number of law enforcement officers is limited, he said. And wildfires believed to be caused by people are frequent - 142 fires of more than 100 acres in Arizona from 2003 to 2010, show data from the Southwest Coordination Center.\par \par \uc2 "Many times, the cases we are able to make and prosecute are when the suspect is caught in the act or soon thereafter, or because someone from the public helps as our eyes and ears," Schneider said. "The problem with fire, depending on how it burns, is that many times fire destroys a lot of evidence that was there."\par \par \uc2 The U.S. Attorney's Office in Arizona has handled just a few wildfire cases each of the past two years, he said. He didn't recall any prosecution of illegal immigrants in connection with wildfires.\par \par \uc2 Pinpointing a cause\par \par \uc2 Annual fire reports from government agencies focus solely on how many fires were caused by people versus lightning, said Carrie Templin, spokeswoman with the Bureau of Land Management.\par \par \uc2 The Horseshoe Fire, which started on May 31, 2010, and burned 3,400 acres in the Chiricahua Mountains northeast of Douglas, remains under investigation, said Coronado Forest spokeswoman Heidi Schewel.\par \par \uc2 Like the Horseshoe 2 Fire, there was no lightning in the area, so both are classified as human-caused.\par \par \uc2 With fires presumed to be started by people, the focus is on finding a specific cause - not on determining where the people were from, said Mary Zabinski, fire information officer at the Southwest Coordination Center.\par \par \uc2 Cause of fires in Southeastern Arizona include sparks from electrical equipment and tailpipes, matches and cigarettes and sometimes strange occurrences, such as a bear getting electrocuted on a power pole and falling to the ground on fire, Zabinski said.\par \par \uc2 But the most common cause of fires, in Arizona and nationwide, is abandoned campfires, Zabinski said. Officials often see a rash of them on holiday weekends.\par \par \uc2 The Murphy Complex Fire was started on May 30 - Memorial Day. That was not lost on Jim Cumming, who lives in a house west of Rio Rico built by his family in 1946.\par \par \uc2 "If you are betting odds, it was probably caused by illegal immigrants," Cumming said about the Murphy Complex Fire. "But being that it was caused on Memorial Day, it could have been caused by a camper. It's anybody's guess who started it."\par \par \uc2 Hot spot for crossers\par \par \uc2 The Murphy Complex Fire is burning west of Nogales, stretching from south of the international border to about 18 miles northwest of Tubac. It is the combination of two blazes that met up: the Pajarita and Murphy fires.\par \par \uc2 The flames are raging right in the heart of a smuggling corridor commonly used by drug runners and rip crews.\par \par \uc2 Border Patrol agent Brian Terry was fatally shot in the same area during a shootout between agents and suspected border bandits on Dec. 14, 2010. The corridor has been a hot spot for confrontations between smugglers and criminals dating back to 2007.\par \par \uc2 Hikers, hunters and outdoor enthusiasts sometime go up there, but the area is primarily used by drug smugglers and illegal immigrants, said Lt. Raoul Rodriguez of the Santa Cruz County Sheriff's Office. That's why he believes it's fair to speculate they started this most recent fire.\par \par \uc2 Cumming doesn't believe the fire was started intentionally, whether by illegal immigrants or U.S. citizens.\par \par \uc2 "It was definitely human-caused," Cumming said, "but by human error."\par \par \uc2 Smugglers don't generally set fires purposely as diversions, said Border Patrol Tucson Sector spokesman Mario Escalante.\par \par \uc2 But they regularly make fires to cook, or to keep warm during the colder months, said Brandon Judd, president of Local 2544 of the National Border Patrol Council, the union representing agents in Arizona. In the areas where the Murphy Complex Fire and Horseshoe 2 Fire started, the only people agents encounter are illegal immigrants or drug smugglers, he said.\par \par \uc2 "We definitely believe that the majority of these fires are started by illegal aliens," Judd said.\par \par \uc2 At the height of the Murphy Complex Fire, firefighters laid a fire retardant 100 yards from area resident Titcomb's ranch-style house he's owned for 15 years in Aliso Springs.\par \par \uc2 "This really hit home, I thought we were going to lose the house," said Titcomb, a native of Nogales, Ariz. "For what, so some guy can smuggle pot or meth?"\par \par \uc2 Titcomb is frustrated that officials only report such fires as human-caused and ignore the reality that some are likely started by smugglers and illegal immigrants. The political sensitivity of border issues scares politicians from talking about the truth, he said.\par \par \uc2 One theory percolating in the Tubac/Rio Rico area is that the Murphy Fire was started by two illegal immigrants in distress.\par \par \uc2 But Titcomb finds that theory hard to believe because all somebody would have to do to get help is walk down from the mountains to the numerous houses nearby. And since it was set in late May, it also seems unlikely it was to keep a group warm.\par \par \uc2 He believes it's more likely that drug smugglers set a fire in the area to burn Border Patrol sensors, a theory he heard from several firefighters. Most of the Border Patrol agents he sees in the area say they are responding to sensors, he said.\par \par \uc2 Border Patrol officials declined to discuss the cause of the Murphy Fire, citing the ongoing Forest Service investigation. Judd, of the union, said he hasn't heard of smugglers burning sensors, but said it might be a new tactic.\par \par \uc2 "It could be effective, sure," Judd said.\par \par \uc2 Focus on loss, not culprit\par \par \uc2 The Horseshoe 2 Fire started May 8, about 35 miles north of the U.S.-Mexico border in the Chiricahua Mountains of Southeastern Arizona.\par \par \uc2 The mountain range and the valleys surrounding it are commonly used by those smuggling drugs and people. Cochise County rancher Robert Krentz was killed in March 2010 on his property south of the fire. The case is still unsolved but authorities believe he was shot by a cross-border smuggler.\par \par \uc2 The Burro Springs area where the fire started is a popular staging area for smugglers, brimming with backpacks and trash left behind, said Ed Ashurst, who manages the 10X Ranch in the valley east of the Chiricahuas. There are propane tanks used to cook up there, he said. It's rugged, mountainous terrain only accessible by foot or horseback.\par \par \uc2 "It's frequented by nobody except illegal aliens," Ashurst said. "Virtually everyone down here believes an illegal alien started it (the fire). Who else started it?"\par \par \uc2 He said he believes the first Horseshoe Fire in 2010 was also started by illegal immigrants but he doesn't expect Forest Service officials to admit that. The Obama administration doesn't want to say it was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  because that would bring into question its claims that the border is more secure than ever, Ashurst said.\par \par \uc2 Ashurst and others have heard that Border Patrol agents tracked four illegal border crossers to the start of the Horseshoe 2 Fire, and that the first Forest Service firefighters spotted the same tracks, he said.\par \par \uc2 His fellow ranchers west of Nogales have told him the Murphy Fire was also caused by illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 But few believe the cases will be solved, which is why area resident Cumming thinks it's a waste of energy to focus on who started the fire. The focus should be on what to do about the tremendous loss of mature trees and habitat for thousands of animals, he said.\par \par \uc2 "This fire has been real devastating," Cumming said. "To sit back and place blame about who caused it is moot."\par \par \uc2 Contact reporter Brady McCombs at 573-4213 or bmccombs@azstarnet. com.

Members of Hezbollah, for example, "are absolute masters at identifying existing smuggling infrastructures on many borders around the world where they operate."\par \par \uc2 The State Department's 2009 "Country Reports on Terrorism" found that "no known international terrorist organizations had an operational presence in Mexico and no terrorist incidents targeting U.S. interests and personnel occurred on or originated from Mexican territory."\par \par \uc2 The State Department said that there was no evidence of ties between Mexican organized crime and international terrorist groups. But it warns: "The violence attributed to organized-crime groups on the border, however, continued to strain Mexico's law-enforcement capacities, creating potential vulnerabilities that terrorists seeking access to the United States could exploit."\par \par \uc2 Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu emphasized the risk of terrorists crossing the Mexican border into the U.S. in a May 26 open letter to President Obama.\par \par \uc2 "If the majority of regular illegal immigrants can sneak into America, what does this say about the ability of terrorist sleeper cells?" Babeu wrote. "The porous U.S.-Mexican border is the gravest national-security threat facing America."\par \par \uc2 Hiding in a car trunk\par \par \uc2 In his letter to the president, Babeu said thousands of illegal immigrants hailing from "special-interest countries" make the U.S.- Mexico border a national-security threat.\par \par \uc2 "In some cases, we have confirmed their troubling ties to terrorism," Babeu wrote. "Yet for those we apprehend, how many today live amongst us?"\par \par \uc2 The Border Patrol apprehended an average of 339 people from "special-interest countries" - those that warrant special handling based on terrorism risk factors - at the U.S.-Mexico border each year over the past six years, Homeland Security data show. That's less than 1 percent each year of the total apprehensions along the U.S.-Mexico border, Homeland Security figures show.\par \par \uc2 None of the 2,039 people arrested at the U.S.-Mexico border in that span presented a credible terrorist threat, Homeland Security officials say.\par \par \uc2 Homeland Security monitors, analyzes and gathers intelligence about potential threats but at this time "does not have any credible information on terrorist groups operating along the Southwest border," said department spokesman Matt Chandler.\par \par \uc2 Among the 36 people convicted by the U.S. Justice Department of charges relating to international terrorism last year, none came into the United States from Mexico. Half were U.S. citizens, most of them naturalized from countries such as Sudan or Somalia. Seven were extradited from other countries, while three were captured abroad by American forces. The others came to the United States on visas, or, in one case, were arrested while trying to come into the United States legally at a port of entry on the Canadian border.\par \par \uc2 However, over the last decade there have been a handful of cases in which suspected terrorists or Muslim extremists crossed the Mexican border illegally. None led to attempted terrorist attacks in the United States.\par \par \uc2 In 2001, for example, Mahmoud Youssef Kourani rode into the United States in the trunk of a car coming from Tijuana. He went on to live in Dearborn, Mich., but was arrested in 2003, and in 2005 was convicted of conspiring to send money to Hezbollah in Lebanon.\par \par \uc2 In January of this year, an extremist imam from Tunisia, Said Jaziri, was arrested while riding in the trunk of a car on a highway east of San Diego. Jaziri, who was expelled from Canada in 2007, hiked across the Mexican border with another \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , and both were picked up by an American driver.\par \par \uc2 But a firefighter saw them pile into the trunk and reported them to Border Patrol agents, who pulled the car over and found the men. Jaziri was charged with a misdemeanor immigration violation.\par \par \uc2 not A traditional route\par \par \uc2 Over the last two decades, almost all of the known international terrorists arrested in the United States have come on legal visas or were allowed to come in without a visa, said Alden, of the Council on Foreign Relations.\par \par \uc2 "These are people that come on airplanes," said Alden, author of "The Closing of the American Border," which explains how the U.S. revised visa and border policies in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.\par \par \uc2 The 19 people involved in the Sept. 11 attacks entered the country on legal visas.\par \par \uc2 And over the last four to five years, the terrorist plots have increasingly involved people already in the United States - citizens and legal residents, he said.\par \par \uc2 "The notion of the (Southwest) border as the line that protects us from terrorism has really gone out of the window in the last several years," Alden said.\par \par \uc2 Not only is the U.S. side of the border heavily guarded, but the Mexican government makes an extraordinary effort to prevent terrorists from coming through its country. For instance, Mexico shares real-time information with the U.S. about airline passengers arriving in Mexico to make sure they don't include potential terrorists, Alden said.\par \par \uc2 The Mexican drug-smuggling organizations have no interest in allowing smuggling routes to be used by terrorist organizations either, he said.\par \par \uc2 "If it is discovered that a terrorist that carried out an attack in the United States came across the Mexican border, then the response would be further fortification of that border that shuts down smuggling routes and cuts into the profits," he said.\par \par \uc2 Being associated with terrorist groups would be very bad for business for drug-smuggling organizations, said Sylvia Longmire, a drug-war analyst and author. Proof of a terrorist coming through Mexico would have dire consequences for the Mexican government, too, she said.\par \par \uc2 But that point of view ignores the fact that terrorist groups and Latin American drug smugglers sometimes do business with each other and therefore have connections, said Braun, the former DEA operations chief, who now runs a security-consulting firm, Spectre Group International.\par \par \uc2 "Hezbollah is now heavily involved in the global cocaine trade," Braun said. "Most of the cocaine they're involved in distributing is heading toward Europe, but they're affiliating with the same cartels sending drugs to the United States."\par \par \uc2 That isn't to say the groups share an ideology, but simply that they have the connections needed to exploit smuggling routes into the United States. Also, people from the Middle East tend to have dark hair, dark eyes and olive skin, like most Latin Americans, so they can easily blend in, he said.\par \par \uc2 "On a moonless night at two in the morning, there's not a lot of due diligence going on when the coyotes and gatekeepers are moving human traffic across that border," Braun said.\par \par \uc2 Canada is a more likely crossing point because that country allows in more people as refugees and asylum seekers, said \uc2 Henry Willis\uc2 , a senior policy researcher on homeland security at the \uc2 Rand Corp\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "To regard the Southwestern border as the 'frontline against terrorism,' as the Border Patrol does, is folly," wrote Barry, of the Center for International Policy, in a recent report.\par \par \uc2 People have talked about terrorists crossing the U.S.-Mexico border, but Anthony Coulson, who retired as head of the Drug Enforcement Administration's Tucson office last year, has seen hardly any evidence.\par \par \uc2 "Through the years I can probably count on my fingers on one hand the number of times that there was some type of terrorist activity associated with the border," Coulson said. "It just doesn't happen."\par \par \uc2 But that's not to say it couldn't.\par \par \uc2 "Border security at the southern U.S. border is a critical national-security issue," said Willis of the \uc2 Rand Corp\uc2 ., "but for many reasons, not solely because of terrorism."\par \par \uc2 Contact reporter Brady McCombs at 573-4213 or bmccombs@azstarnet.com.\par \par \uc2 Contact reporter Tim Steller at 807-8427 or at tsteller@azstarnet.com\par \par \uc2 Bill would label drug smugglers terrorists\par \par \uc2 Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, wants Mexican drug-smuggling organizations designated as terrorists.\par \par \uc2 A bill he has proposed would help authorities go after cartels and those who assist them, he said during a May 11 hearing of the House Committee on Homeland Security.\par \par \uc2 "Federal law defines terrorism as activity that is intended to intimidate a civilian population or to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or to affect the conduct of a government by assassination or kidnapping," McCaul said during the hearing. "In my judgment, the drug cartels fall squarely within this definition."\par \par \uc2 One factor behind the push is the violent turf battles in Mexico between drug-smuggling organizations, which killed more than 34,500 people from December 2006 to December 2010, says the Trans Border Institute at the University of San Diego.\par \par \uc2 The highly publicized death of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent Jaime Zapata in Mexico in February escalated concerns even more. Zapata was killed when gunmen attacked a vehicle he was in with another agent in the Mexican state of San Luis Potosi.\par \par \uc2 Classifying Mexican organized-crime groups as terrorist organization would be ill-advised because they are "clearly illicit business enterprises that lack any political motivation other than profit," said David Shirk, director of the Trans-Border Institute.\par \par \uc2 Given the chaotic and unpredictable violent conflict in Mexico, the cartels are a real and present danger to the United States, Shirk testified in late March before a House Committee on Homeland Security. But designating them as terrorists could present a serious problem to U.S. foreign policy.\par \par \uc2 "The concept of terrorism will be so expansive we could apply the same label to virtually any group of illicit actors that coerce through scare tactics and intimidation: human traffickers, kidnappers, U.S. gangs, and maybe even FIFA," Shirk wrote in an email. FIFA, world soccer's governing body, is embroiled in a bribery and corruption scandal.\par \par \uc2 But McCaul says the cartels are a growing national-security threat to both the U.S. and Mexico. His bill, which has been referred to committee, would give cartels reason to be afraid, he said.\par \par \uc2 "In my view, Mexico is losing this war and so are we," he said on May 11. "The cartels do not fear U.S. law enforcement."\par \par \uc2 Document TUCS000020110629e7650001m\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 NEWS\par {\*\bkmkstart toc12}{\*\bkmkend toc12}\b \uc2 Obama mocks GOP in push for immigration overhaul\b0\par\par\uc2 BRADY MCCOMBS   \par \uc2 BRADY MCCOMBS, ARIZONA DAILY STAR\par \uc2 1,220 \uc2 words\par \uc2 11 May 2011\par \uc2 The Arizona Daily Star\par \uc2 TUCS\par \uc2 FINAL\par A1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2011 The Arizona Daily Star.

"But, I suspect there's going to be those who try to move the goal posts on us one more time."\par \par \uc2 They'll now call for even more Border Patrol agents and a higher fence, he said.\par \par \uc2 "Maybe they'll say we need a moat? Maybe they'll want alligators in the moat?" Obama said. "They'll never be satisfied. And I understand that; that's politics. But the truth is that the measures we've put in place are getting results."\par \par \uc2 The administration has continued the work started during the second Bush administration, adding more Border Patrol agents and intelligence analysts, building more border fencing, adding unmanned aerial systems and forging partnerships with Mexico. Obama cited a decrease in Border Patrol apprehensions of illegal border crossers, an increase in contraband seizures and low violent-crime rates in U.S. border cities as evidence their efforts are working.\par \par \uc2 The next step to increase border security is reforming the "broken" legal immigration system, so fewer people are forced to cross the border illegally, leaving the Border Patrol to focus on criminals, Obama said.\par \par \uc2 But Republicans disagree with his assessment, citing incidents such as the killings of Border Patrol agent Brian Terry in December and rancher Robert Krentz in March 2010, both in Arizona.\par \par \uc2 "President Obama speaks about our broken immigration system; but what about our broken borders?" asked Arizona Republican Sens. John McCain and Jon Kyl in a joint statement. "We hear from our constituents on a daily basis, and, while some progress has been made in some areas, they do not believe the border is secure."\par \par \uc2 And some questioned whether the president's speech was a sincere attempt to drive reform or a strategy to recapture Latino voters in 2012.\par \par \uc2 "These are some of same good words we heard from President Obama as a candidate the last round," said Jennifer Allen, executive director of Tucson-based Border Action Network. "The challenge for the president is turning these words into meaningful action, so this doesn't just come across like this was to get the Latino vote."\par \par \uc2 Obama's Tuesday speech was his latest effort to push for reform. He's had several meetings this past month with business, labor, law enforcement and faith leaders. He also met with Latino entertainment and media stars.\par \par \uc2 He vowed to continue leading the charge but asked the public to help push Congress to take up the issue.\par \par \uc2 "I am asking you to add your voices to this," Obama said. "We need Washington to know that there is a movement for reform gathering strength from coast to coast. That's how we'll get this done."\par \par \uc2 While the president may be sincere in his intentions to push for reform, it's highly unlikely any reform will get through Congress with the Republicans controlling the House, said Steve Camarota, director of research for the Center for Immigration Studies, a Washington-based organization that advocates for slowing immigration.\par \par \uc2 Obama has pledged to push for immigration reform since he took office but with no results. There are an estimated 11.2 million illegal immigrants living in the United States, according to the latest Pew Hispanic Center study. Some crossed the border illegally and others overstayed visas.\par \par \uc2 "The overwhelming majority of these folks are just trying to earn a living and provide for their families," Obama said. "But they've broken the rules and have cut in front of the line. And the truth is, the presence of so many illegal immigrants makes a mockery of all those who are trying to immigrate legally."\par \par \uc2 Contact reporter Brady McCombs at 573-4213 or bmccombs@azstarnet.com.\par \par \uc2 Immigration reform highlights\par \par \uc2 * Continue enforcing the law and securing the border.\par \par \uc2 * Punish businesses that hire and exploit \uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2  workers.\par \par \uc2 * Establish a path to residency for illegal immigrants that requires them to pay a fine, learn English, pay taxes, undergo background checks and go through a lengthy process before they can get in line for legal status.\par \par \uc2 * Revamp the outdated legal-immigration system to make it easier for the "best and brightest" to not only study here, but to start businesses and create jobs.\par \par \uc2 * Provide farms a legal way to hire the workers they need, and provide a path for those workers to get legal status.\par \par \uc2 * Adjust laws so families following the rules are reunited more quickly.\par \par \uc2 * Pass the Dream Act, which would allow people brought here illegally as children to go to college and join the military.\par \par \uc2 The reaction\par \par \uc2 Arizona Sens. John McCain and Jon Kyl\par \par \uc2 "During the president's first visit to our nation's southern border, we hope he will finally see firsthand the continued security challenges facing all of those who live along our southwest border," McCain and Kyl said in a joint statement.\par \par \uc2 McCain and Kyl urged Obama to pass the Republican duo's border security-enforcement bill before calling for immigration reform. And they questioned why Obama chose to give his speech in El Paso instead of Arizona, which has been the busiest stretch of border for a decade.\par \par \uc2 "As he is well aware, the Tucson Sector remains the most trafficked sector, with close to a quarter million apprehensions just last year. By comparison, the El Paso Sector where President Obama is speaking hasn't had over 200,000 apprehensions since 1993. It is no wonder the president chose El Paso and not Tucson as a backdrop to talk about immigration reform."\par \par \uc2 Gov. Jan Brewer\par \par \uc2 "After two years of waiting, I am glad the White House has chosen to focus on immigration. But I remain skeptical. It would be a shame if this effort is more about locking down votes in 2012 than securing our nation's border today."\par \par \uc2 "The president should have come to the Arizona border, where I have invited him repeatedly," Brewer said. "He should have spoken to our ranchers, who live with drug-runners and human-smugglers crossing their lands. He should have met with our law enforcement officers, who are frequently outgunned by the heavily-armed cartels."\par \par \uc2 "If the president felt confident in declaring the border secure, he should have come to tell the people of Arizona face-to-face."\par \par \uc2 U.S. Rep. Raul Grijalva\par \par \uc2 The president laid out the framework well for what immigration reform needs to include and reminded people why it's an issue that needs attention now, and not in 10, 20 or 50 years, Grijalva said. Grijalva said he wishes Obama would have made this speech earlier in his presidency but said it was still a necessary affirmation of his position. Obama was correct that Republicans continue to "move the goal posts" and demand more enforcement. "The president said it really well," Grijalva said. "There is no satisfaction point.

Search warrants were also presented at two houses in Tucson and three houses in Phoenix.\par \par \uc2 The arrests are the culmination of a two-year investigation that began with an anonymous tip that Chuy's was hiring illegal immigrants, Crocker said. The Evensons hired illegal immigrants to work in the kitchens of 15 Chuy's restaurants in Arizona and California, paying them off the books to avoid paying taxes, he said.\par \par \uc2 Agents also arrested 40 illegal immigrants they encountered Wednesday at Chuy's locations in Arizona and California, including 18 in Tucson, Picard said. They are facing administrative immigration charges. But they weren't the focus of the investigation, Crocker said.\par \par \uc2 "Our goal is not just to round up illegal aliens," Crocker said. "What we want to do is target the employers.

The three will be arraigned today in federal court in Tucson.\par \par \uc2 The company paid the \uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2  workers by check and did not report their earnings in the quarterly federal tax returns, the indictment shows. The company has failed to pay at least $400,000 in Federal Insurance Contribution Act (Social Security and Medicare) taxes since January 2008, the indictment shows.\par \par \uc2 "That provides an unfair commercial advantage for Chuy's," Crocker said.\par \par \uc2 The Evensons hired legal workers to be servers and perform other front-of-the-restaurant jobs and paid them through regular payroll practices. The illegal workers were hired for the kitchen, the indictment says.\par \par \uc2 Crocker said investigators are confident they've gathered sufficient evidence to prove in court that the Evensons "knowingly" hired the \uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2  workers. That's a requirement of federal law for an employer to be found guilty.\par \par \uc2 In November 2010, Mark Evenson instructed an employee preparing payroll that the restaurant did "cash" for the back help, the indictment says. "If those Social Security numbers get in the state, they'll come pick them up," Mark Evenson said.\par \par \uc2 After receiving a complaint about illegal workers at a Lake Havasu City Chuy's in September 2010, Mark Evenson told an employee, "If we throw some American people in there, maybe that'll just shut (them) up," the indictment says.

I need to hide you in the kitchen."\par \par \uc2 When an employee told Christopher Evenson in August 2010 that a person he wanted to hire who was working at another restaurant had "no papers," Christopher Evenson told the employee that the other restaurant did "the same thing," the indictment says.\par \par \uc2 Dating to 2008, the Evensons hired about 360 illegal immigrants to work at the 11 Chuy's in Arizona, the indictment alleges.

Raul Grijalva.\par \par \uc2 Because of his controversial positions, Pima County Republican officials considered distancing the party from his congressional campaign in 2004, calling him a "racist." He also came under criticism for frequent anti-homosexual comments. The county GOP ultimately decided not to get involved one way or another.\par \par \uc2 Family members were still sorting through the details of Sweeney's life and unexpected death as they fielded calls from the community Monday. Sweeney's nephew, Philip Cojanis, said the family is still jarred by the news, but is putting together plans and more information about him for the public.\par \par \uc2 "He was a good man, and from what we're even just finding out, he helped so many people in so many ways. We're just overwhelmed by how many people are finding out what's happened," Cojanis said. "He had a much bigger heart than many other people would know."\par \par \uc2 His sister said he was reliable and liked to handle things on his own. True to his nature, he didn't let family members know he was ill, Nelson said.\par \par \uc2 A middle child, Sweeney was born Aug. 4, 1944, in Nebraska. The family moved to Tucson in the 1950s, where Sweeney lived the rest of his life.\par \par \uc2 Sweeney ran his political campaigns on a shoestring budget and a platform of stopping illegal immigration, and rarely missed a chance to speak about it at the open portions of weekly government meetings.\par \par \uc2 Russ Dove, who appeared on Sweeney's public-access television show for three or four years, said Monday that he respected Sweeney for his high intelligence and ability to shrug off sometimes harsh popular opinion.\par \par \uc2 "He did what he did because he believed it was the right thing to do and he was obligated to do the right thing," Dove said.\par \par \uc2 "He truly believed in some form of superior race or some form of select group of people the scriptures applied to. I always argued that they apply to everyone.\par \par \uc2 "Joe Sweeney had the heart of Abraham Lincoln; he just didn't stop," Dove said, noting that Sweeney also traveled to Washington, D.C., to advocate for Peace Corps funding and was a strong supporter of the program.\par \par \uc2 "I wish that more people would take that interest in their community and put that forward to making the world a better place as Joe Sweeney did," Dove said. "I think he could have been more effective if he had taken Jesus at his face value and just loved, instead of loving his own. I think that was his greatest fault."\par \par \uc2 Local politician and government gadfly John Kromko didn't often find himself on the same side of many issues with Sweeney. But Kromko said he respected Sweeney for speaking his mind.\par \par \uc2 Kromko, a former state legislator and frequent political candidate, said he met Sweeney when he ran a print shop and Sweeney got materials printed for his law school.\par \par \uc2 "The underlying thing old Joe always believed was that the law was the key thing, that if people learned the law they could work for justice and their rights," Kromko said.\par \par \uc2 Sweeney started the Alexander Hamilton Evening Law School in the late 1970s.\par \par \uc2 Armed with his University of Arizona bachelor's degree in agriculture, he didn't charge tuition to the unaccredited school, but accepted donations. Those who completed the program received a certificate of recognition.\par \par \uc2 Kromko said it's rare to find someone who stuck so surely to his beliefs. Sweeney lost a job decades ago, and later found out his former employer had hired an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  for much lower wages, Kromko said.

But they don't know for sure if he's in the U.S. or Mexico - or if he's dead or alive.\par \par \uc2 And even if they find him, it won't mean the crime is solved. Authorities haven't found the gun used to kill Robert Krentz on his ranch last March 27, and they have no witnesses, show investigation documents the Daily Star obtained through public records requests.\par \par \uc2 Alejandro Chavez-Vasquez is not an official suspect in Krentz's murder but is a "person of interest" in a series of Portal burglaries in early 2010, say Cochise County sheriff's officials.\par \par \uc2 Investigators believe there is a link between two of those burglaries and the murder, documents show. A search warrant affidavit filed in Cochise County Court on March 31, 2010, by Immigration and Customs Enforcement shows investigators believe the burglar who stole a Glock 26 handgun and two cellphones from a vehicle near the town of Portal the day before is the person who killed Krentz.\par \par \uc2 The federal agency has been assisting the Cochise County Sheriff's Office with the case.\par \par \uc2 Krentz was murdered with the same caliber firearm that was reported stolen from the car, the affidavit said. The burglary occurred in the Herb Martyr campground in the Chiricahua Mountains about seven miles southwest of Portal, a Cochise County Sheriff's Office report shows.\par \par \uc2 Investigators have homed in on Chavez-Vasquez because of his height - 6 feet 3 inches - and criminal background. The shoe prints tracked from the crime scene about 20 miles south to the border were size 11, said Warner Glenn, a mountain lion hunter who helped track the prints. Based on the shoe size and 31-to-32 inch stride, Glenn and investigators estimate the killer is at least 6 feet tall.\par \par \uc2 Footprints of the same size and pattern were found at the campground vehicle burglary and at an area home that was likely burglarized during the day of March 27, shows a Cochise County sheriff's report.\par \par \uc2 Chavez-Vasquez, likely in his late 30s, has convictions in four states for crimes including sexual assault, vehicle theft and possession of narcotics. He also pleaded guilty in 2004 to illegal re-entry after deportation.\par \par \uc2 In April, the Cochise County Sheriff's Office distributed a photo of Chavez-Vasquez to media outlets, area ranchers and Mexican authorities. Agua Prieta Police Chief Alfonso Novoa Novoa said Border Patrol officials told him Chavez-Vasquez could be a suspect in the killing.\par \par \uc2 Agua Prieta police distributed 500 pictures around the border city south of Douglas, but nobody claimed to know anything about Chavez-Vasquez. They also ran his name through municipal, state and federal databases throughout Mexico but found nothing - no property, no voter card, no driver's license, Novoa said.\par \par \uc2 And so one of 2010's highest-profile murders - one that helped prompt Arizona's tough new immigration law - remains a mystery.\par \par \uc2 Many of the questions that surfaced in the days following Krentz's murder remain unanswered: Why would someone kill a man known to family and friends as a teddy bear? Was the killing to punish the Krentz family for a call his brother made to the Border Patrol the day before about bundles of marijuana found on their property? Was Krentz targeted or was the killing random? Did it mark a sea change in the long-held rule among smugglers that they lie low in the U.S. for the good of their business?\par \par \uc2 There's no closure for Krentz's heartbroken widow, children and grandchildren. There's no explanation for shaken ranchers desperate to know if they should be worried for their own safety in this remote valley near the Arizona-New Mexico state line.\par \par \uc2 "We would like to know what the heck happened," said Bill McDonald, a fifth-generation rancher east of Douglas. "It doesn't make any sense to us."\par \par \uc2 Cochise County Sheriff Larry Dever would not answer specific questions about the investigation but said his office believes the killer was involved in smuggling people or drugs in Cochise County.\par \par \uc2 "Rob Krentz was killed by a bad person with a bad agenda, and our porous borders continue to contribute to the potential for another event," Dever said via email.\par \par \uc2 The investigation has momentum in the U.S. and in Mexico, where officials have been extremely helpful, Dever wrote. There is a $45,000 reward for information.\par \par \uc2 "I will never rest until this killer is brought to justice," Dever wrote.\par \par \uc2 But as days and months pass, fewer people believe the murder will be solved.\par \par \uc2 "The older the case gets," said Richard Winkler, a Krentz family friend and former Cochise County Superior Court Judge, "the harder it gets to solve."\par \par \uc2 The case so far\par \par \uc2 Authorities didn't discover Krentz's body until just before midnight on March 27, giving the killer a nearly 14-hour head start to flee south to Mexico.\par \par \uc2 He was likely long gone by the time they followed his tracks to the border the next afternoon. Without a suspect to follow, investigators looked to the burglaries for clues. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials hoped the call history of the two cellphones stolen from the campground near Portal would lead lead them closer to the killer.\par \par \uc2 One was used the day of the robbery to call two phone numbers, phone records obtained through a search warrant show. But the names of the people called that day didn't help: The numbers were registered to famed Mexican Revolution generals Pancho Villa and Emiliano Zapata.\par \par \uc2 In Mexico, authorities began searching for the killer the day after Krentz was found. State police looked for shoe prints and talked to ranchers near where he crossed over.\par \par \uc2 On the Monday after the killing, Agua Prieta police brought in about 100 people for questioning, fingerprints and photos in an attempt to find somebody who knew something about the crime, said Novoa, the Agua Prieta police chief. They didn't yet have any information about the size of the shoe or gun used, so they focused on people who had scrapes or bites, thinking that maybe the killer was bitten by Krentz's dog or otherwise hurt, Novoa said. But they didn't find anything.\par \par \uc2 In the U.S., investigators also interviewed people who might have information. One was a man arrested by the DEA on April 6 who officials thought might know something due to his associates and location of the arrest. He denied knowing anything about the murder.\par \par \uc2 Another was a suspected smuggler apprehended by the Border Patrol on April 8 who normally works in the corridor east of Douglas. He denied knowing anything about the crime but said the talk was that the "cartels were pissed because there was too much heat, and they were not able to easily get people and drugs through."\par \par \uc2 On April 9, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Border Patrol put out alerts to cover an area within a 15-mile radius of the crime scene with special emphasis on "6-foot-tall or taller smugglers, guides and repeat offenders," Cochise County Sheriff's Office reports show.\par \par \uc2 Chavez-Vasquez appears to be the only person being sought in the murder.\par \par \uc2 Who is Chavez-Vasquez?\par \par \uc2 Chavez-Vasquez has criminal convictions in four states - Colorado, Utah, Nevada and Oregon - and an immigration charge out of Arizona.\par \par \uc2 He spent two years in a Nevada prison, from 2002 to 2004, on a coercion conviction that stemmed from an arrest by Las Vegas police on suspicion that he attempted to sexually assault a woman.\par \par \uc2 He was paroled on April 15, 2004, from Nevada prisons, records from the Nevada Department of Corrections show.\par \par \uc2 A month later, he was arrested in Arizona and charged in U.S. District Court with illegal re-entry after deportation. He was given 36 months' supervised release and a fine of $100 in a plea agreement, federal records show.\par \par \uc2 Despite the deportation, it's unclear whether he is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . Clark County, Nev., court records show a Social Security number for Chavez-Vasquez that suggests he was born in California. Nevada officials could not confirm if the Social Security number was valid.\par \par \uc2 His criminal records show four birth dates that put him between 37 and 41 years old.\par \par \uc2 Though the Cochise County Sheriff's Office said Chavez-Vasquez was from Agua Prieta, the police chief there said he doesn't believe it.\par \par \uc2 "If somebody knows that 60 to 80 police officers are looking for a person, some kind of information arrives," Novoa said in Spanish.\par \par \uc2 family, ranchers feel loss\par \par \uc2 To say 2010 was a nightmare for Susan Krentz would be a gross understatement.\par \par \uc2 She lost her husband in March, and on Sept. 25 a suspected drunken driver hit her and a friend as they left church in Douglas. She suffered several skull and hip fractures and is still seeing doctors regularly, said her attorney, Paul Hoffman of Tucson. "She is lucky to have lived," Hoffman said.\par \par \uc2 In addition to dealing with her injuries, she misses her husband dearly. "All I can say is that my heart is broken, and I can't get over it," she said in a brief phone interview.\par \par \uc2 She desperately wants the crime solved, Hoffman said.\par \par \uc2 "We never asked to ride this horse that we are on, but it is saddled now and we must go on," said a family statement issued this month. "We are still searching for the truth of what happened that day and hope to someday put closure to this tragedy."\par \par \uc2 The Krentz family is frustrated with the investigation, said Don Kimble, a cousin of Sue Krentz's. Though a close friend of Sheriff Dever, Kimble doesn't hold back his criticism of the Sheriff's Office for waiting for the suspected killer to surface. "I think they should be more aggressive," Kimble said. "Hanging back and watching never gets nothing done.."\par \par \uc2 Kimble thinks authorities should more aggressively advertise in Mexico the cash reward for information about the murder. "I truly believe that if the money got placed in the right hands, the killer would show up," Kimble said.\par \par \uc2 Friends and neighbors in the hourglass-shaped San Bernardino and San Simon valleys near the Arizona-New Mexico state line are still troubled by the killing.\par \par \uc2 A noticeable boost in Border Patrol agents and technology there has slowed illegal activity a bit, but the smugglers keep coming. "The outlaws and dope and the guns are still here," said Ed Ashurstwho manages a ranch just north of the Krentzes and helped track the killer's footprints. "There is this combination of anger and depression and cynicism."\par \par \uc2 Ashurst believes his friend simply ran into a criminal who was intent on not getting caught and sent back to prison.\par \par \uc2 "I was worried the moment he got into Mexico that they were going to be able solve this," said fellow rancher Bill McDonald. "I continued to be worried despite assurances to the contrary."\par \par \uc2 Although authorities don't know whether Krentz's killer is still alive, what Sheriff Dever said about him during a press conference on March 29, 2010, still rings true a year later: "He is the only person living that knows exactly what happened out there that day."\par \par \uc2 Contact reporter Brady McCombs at 573-4213 or bmccombs@azstarnet.com\par \par \uc2 On StarNet: Go to azstarnet.com/gallery for more photos.\par \par \uc2 Timeline\par \par \uc2 March 27, 2010: Robert Krentz sets out to check wells on his 35,000-acre ranch about 35 miles northeast of Douglas.\par \par \uc2 10 a.m. - Is heard on a handheld ranch radio telling his brother to contact the U.S. Border Patrol because he has found an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who needs help.\par \par \uc2 11 a.m. - After getting no answer on radio and cell phones, his son, Frank Krentz, and brother, Phil Krentz, start searching for him.\par \par \uc2 6:22 p.m. - Neighboring rancher calls the Cochise County Sheriff's Office to report Krentz missing.

The book is a finalist for the Edgar Allan Poe Award from the Mystery Writers of America, which will be presented April 28.\par \par \uc2 "In the fall of 2000 a young woman from an upper-middle class California family left the West Coast for Washington, D.C., to begin an internship at the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Chandra Ann Levy was not unlike the thousands of college and graduate students who arrive in Washington as interns each year. She wanted to leave the familiar surroundings of her home in the San Joaquin Valley and find her own way in the nation's epicenter of politics and power. At twenty- three, she hoped to become an agent for the FBI or the CIA one day. Seven months after arriving in Washington, Chandra signed off her computer inside her Dupont Circle apartment on a warm spring day and went for a walk in her gym clothes. She was never heard from again.\par \par \uc2 "D.C. detectives investigating her disappearance soon learned that Chandra had been carrying on a months-long affair with a married congressman from her home district in California. At fifty- two, Gary Condit was handsome and charismatic, a conservative Democrat who had been in Congress for eleven years. Word of the affair leaked and the news media became obsessed by the story of sex and suspicion. The coverage was incessant. During the summer of 2001, the story generated sensational headlines in newspapers around the world. The fledgling cable news shows that relied so heavily on fame, crime and scandal to energize their broadcasts updated the story every twelve minutes or so, and polls showed that nearly two- thirds of the nation was following every turn of the real-life soap opera. When Condit consented to a nationally televised interview late that summer, 24 million Americans tuned in. But nearly three weeks later, when terrorists struck the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, the story about the congressman and the intern became a curiosity of the pre-9/11 world and quickly faded.\par \par \uc2 "Six years later, two investigative reporters revisited Washington's most famous murder mystery."\par \par \uc2 Sari Horwitz wanted justice for Chandra Levy. A 24-year-old Washington, D.C., intern from California, Levy left her apartment in May 2001 and vanished. About a year later her bones were found scattered in a forested area of Rock Creek Park.\par \par \uc2 After a media and investigative frenzy singularly focused on California Congressman Gary Condit, with whom Levy had a relationship, the case went cold.\par \par \uc2 Investigators reopened Levy's case after Horwitz and Scott Higham of the Washington Post's investigation unit re-examined the murder and the surrounding circumstances in a newspaper series and in their book "Finding Chandra: A True Washington Murder Mystery."\par \par \uc2 Subsequently, Ingmar Guandique was arrested in 2009, found guilty of Levy's murder in November, and sentenced to 60 years in prison last month.\par \par \uc2 Longtime Tucsonans may remember Tucson-native Horwitz wrapping holiday presents at Crescent Jewelry, the store her late father owned. She said she's proud of being a Tucson High Badger - she was student-body president in 1975 - and last year was inducted into the Tucson High School Hall of Fame. Horwitz comes to Tucson every couple of months to visit her mother, Zella Horwitz.\par \par \uc2 Horwitz, who began as summer intern in 1984, is a three-time Pulitzer-Prize-winning member of the Post's investigation unit. Early in her career she said she fell in love with the police beat. Law enforcement has been the center of her long-term investigations.\par \par \uc2 While she did not report the original Chandra Levy story, she said she was "fascinated by a young woman from the West Coast with all these dreams who disappears in the nation's capital, not to be found."\par \par \uc2 In 2007 - six years after the case went bust - the editor of the Post's investigative team asked Horwitz and Higham to "go back and find out what happened. Take a year to look over and under every stone," Horwitz said in a phone interview.\par \par \uc2 "I'm so haunted by the story and so saddened," said Horwitz. "I wanted to find justice for Chandra."\par \par \uc2 Horwitz said they found mistakes in the investigation and found some fault with the media.\par \par \uc2 "It was a sexier story to talk about Gary Condit," said Horwitz. In a calmer atmosphere, Horwitz said she and Higham were able to take apart the case, piece by piece, interview by interview.\par \par \uc2 The result was a 13-part series, an experiment by the Post to bring narrative back into the paper. The series indentified an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from El Salvador, who was serving time for assaulting two other women in the park where Levy's remains were found.\par \par \uc2 Horwitz and Higham reworked the series into the book. A chapter about the trial has been added to the paperback version, which will be available at the end of April.\par \par \uc2 "What we saw in the summer 2001 was criminal justice at its worst," said Horwitz. What happened later was criminal justice at its best: A strong case. Good lawyering. A jury that gave thoughtful consideration.\par \par \uc2 In this time of 24/7 journalism and blogs, there is pressure to be first but not necessarily right, Horwitz said.\par \par \uc2 "In these big cases, rumor and innuendo are flying all over," and the police and the media should not to rush to judgment, she said.\par \par \uc2 Horwitz was here on Jan. 8. Noting it was odd to file stories from her hometown and to call school friends as resources, Horwitz reported on the shooting and continues to cover the aftermath and U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords' recovery for the Post.\par \par \uc2 Horwitz cites coverage of the shooting and the premature, inaccurate reporting that Giffords had died as an example of the precarious and emotionally damaging rush to be first that's plaguing the news industry.\par \par \uc2 While she helped find justice for Levy, Horwitz emphasized there will be never be closure. The Levys will never have their daughter.\par \par \uc2 IF You Go\par \par \uc2 Sari Horwitz with Gary Stuart - "True Crime: Chandra Levy and the Buddhist Temple Massacre" at 11:30 a.m. in Chemistry, Room 111; and "Writing about True Crime" workshop at 1 p.m. next Sunday in the Integrated Learning Center, Room 141.\par \par \uc2 Document TUCS000020110319e73600019\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 NEWS\par {\*\bkmkstart toc18}{\*\bkmkend toc18}\b \uc2 Single shot killed border agent\b0\par\par\uc2 BRADY MCCOMBS   \par \uc2 BRADY MCCOMBS, ARIZONA DAILY STAR\par \uc2 1,097 \uc2 words\par \uc2 3 March 2011\par \uc2 The Arizona Daily Star\par \uc2 TUCS\par \uc2 FINAL\par A1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2011 The Arizona Daily Star.

Two agents returned fire, one with a long gun and one with a pistol, but Terry was mortally wounded in the gunfight.\par \par \uc2 Border Patrol officials declined to answer questions about protocol for use of force, citing the ongoing investigation.\par \par \uc2 But Terry's brother, Kent Terry, said the other agents who were there that night told him that they were instructed to use the non- lethal beanbags first. It's a policy that doesn't make sense to Kent Terry.\par \par \uc2 "You go up against a bandit crew that is carrying AKs, and you walk out there with guns loaded with beanbags - I don't get it," Terry said in a phone interview from Michigan. "It's like going to the Iraqi war with one knife. It boggles my mind. ... These guys (Border Patrol agents) are professionals; they should be able to use their judgment call on their own."\par \par \uc2 On the night of the deadly encounter, agents were trying to apprehend at least five suspected illegal immigrants. One agent, using thermal binoculars, spotted two men carrying rifles. When the group came close, at least one agent identified himself as police and ordered the men to drop their weapons.\par \par \uc2 Here's how the rest of the events are described in the FBI document:\par \par \uc2 "When the suspected aliens did not drop their weapons, two Border Patrol agents deployed 'less than lethal' beanbags at the suspected aliens. At this time, at least one of the suspected aliens fired at the Border Patrol agents. Two Border Patrol agents returned fire, one with his long gun and one with his pistol.\par \par \uc2 "Border Patrol agent Brian Terry was shot with one bullet and died shortly after. One of the suspected illegal aliens, later identified as Manuel Osorio-Arellanes, was also shot."\par \par \uc2 The search warrants were requested to examine fingerprints and a hair sample from Osorio-Arellanes, who was one of four men arrested that night near the shooting scene. The other three arrested, illegal immigrants from Mexico, have been cleared in connection with the crime and deported back to their home countries.\par \par \uc2 Osorio-Arellanes has not been charged in connection with the fatal shooting. He has been charged only with illegal re-entry after deportation and is awaiting a May 10 trial. The FBI document represents the first time his name has been included in a public document related to the shooting.\par \par \uc2 Two days after the shooting, Osorio-Arellanes agreed to talk to FBI agents. He was traveling with four others that night, all of whom were armed, Osorio-Arellanes told investigators, according to the document.\par \par \uc2 "Osorio-Arellanes stated that he had raised his weapon towards the Border Patrol agents, but he did not fire because he realized that they were Border Patrol agents," the search warrant says. "At this time, he was shot."\par \par \uc2 Two firearms were recovered at the scene that are believed to belong to the suspects, the documents say. Officials were planning to take Osorio-Arellanes' fingerprints to compare with those found on the two weapons.\par \par \uc2 Officials also recovered five backpacks, three gloves, two sweat shirts, a pullover, a jacket, a knit hat, a baseball cap and a razor.\par \par \uc2 The summary provided in the search warrants is only a snapshot and does not include all facts known by investigators, FBI agents wrote in the three separate search-warrant requests filed in U.S. District Court in late December.\par \par \uc2 Terry, 40, of Michigan, was a member of a specially trained tactical unit known as Bortac. On the night of the shooting, Terry and his crew were targeting a "rip crew" that robbed and assaulted drug runners and illegal immigrants, said Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano.\par \par \uc2 This week, the Terry family received the autopsy report, which shows that Terry was shot once in the lower back, about 29 inches down from the right shoulder, Kent Terry said. Brian Terry was trying to turn, likely for cover, when he was shot, Kent Terry said. The bullet found inside his body was one used with AK-47s, he said.\par \par \uc2 The report gave the family some closure, and it erased any doubt about friendly fire being a possibility in the fatal shooting, because agents don't use AK-47s, Kent Terry said. The FBI announced in mid-February that it had ruled out friendly fire, but Kent Terry remained skeptical because he hadn't seen the autopsy.\par \par \uc2 The Terry family remains upset about allegations that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives allowed a gun smuggler it was investigating to purchase and smuggle into Mexico the weapons used in the shootout in which Terry died. The Justice Department has denied the allegations, but U.S. Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, continues to insist on the validity of the claims.\par \par \uc2 "Your government is telling you to use beanbags, but you are selling guns back to the Mexicans," Kent Terry said. "There's a lot of questions that they haven't answered."\par \par \uc2 The FBI investigation remains ongoing, said agency spokesman Manuel Johnson. No arrests have been made. The U.S. Attorney's Office in Arizona said investigators and prosecutors aim to bring criminal charges against the people responsible for Brian Terry's murder.\par \par \uc2 Terry, 40, was the 10th agent to die on duty in the Border Patrol's Tucson Sector since 1926 and the first agent shot to death since 1998. Terry was buried in his hometown of Detroit on Dec. 22, and hundreds attended his memorial service January in Tucson.\par \par \uc2 Contact reporter Brady McCombs at 573-4213 or bmccombs@azstarnet.com.\par \par \uc2 On StarNet: Find extensive coverage of immigration issues at azstarnet.com/border\par \par \uc2 Document TUCS000020110316e73300002\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 TUCSON/REGION\par {\*\bkmkstart toc19}{\*\bkmkend toc19}\b \uc2 Aggression escalating in border marauders\b0\par\par\uc2 BRADY MCCOMBS   \par \uc2 BRADY MCCOMBS, ARIZONA DAILY STAR\par \uc2 1,331 \uc2 words\par \uc2 22 December 2010\par \uc2 The Arizona Daily Star\par \uc2 TUCS\par \uc2 FINAL\par A2\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2010 The Arizona Daily Star.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Bandits, around for a long time, now so bold they threaten chaos\par \par \uc2 Bandits such as the ones Border Patrol agent Brian Terry was trying to apprehend last week when he was shot and killed have been around for decades but have become more brazen in recent years, law enforcement officials say.\par \par \uc2 And it has become the Border Patrol's job to police these groups to make sure that chaos doesn't engulf Arizona's stretch of U.S.- Mexico border.\par \par \uc2 Scant details have been made public about what happened in the Dec. 14 gunbattle northwest of Nogales, but officials have confirmed that Terry and his fellow agents in a specially trained tactical unit known as Bortac were targeting a "rip crew" that robbed and assaulted drug runners and illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 That means Terry, a 40-year-old agent from Michigan, likely died performing the "savior" part of the Border Patrol's "hunter and savior" mission. While the agency's primary objective is stopping illegal immigrants and drug smugglers from making it north, the agency devotes considerable time and resources to rescuing illegal immigrants in distress and keeping armed and increasingly dangerous bandits in check.\par \par \uc2 "The Border Patrol is out there to prevent people from getting killed," said Anthony Coulson, a recently retired assistant special agent in charge of the Drug Enforcement Administration's Tucson office. "Even if they are partly responsible for putting themselves in this situation, there are people out there that you have an obligation to protect. It's the right thing to do. It's the humanitarian thing to do."\par \par \uc2 The bandits, also known as bajadores, often prey on men, women and children crossing Arizona's border illegally. They rob, attack and sometimes sexually assault them. More recently, Mexican drug- smuggling organizations have started using bandit crews to police their routes, ensuring that competitors don't use their hard-earned corridors, often stealing the loads.\par \par \uc2 They operate all along Arizona's international border, but the canyon-filled corridor west of Interstate 19 where Terry was killed has been a hot spot for bandits for years. In 2007, there were two fatal shootings involving bandits in the area.\par \par \uc2 Santa Cruz County Sheriff Tony Estrada said he is grateful that the Border Patrol targets the bandits - allowing them to operate freely would not only result in harm to illegal immigrants but could also put residents who live along the border in jeopardy.\par \par \uc2 "It provides assurances to residents in the area that law enforcement is around," Estrada said.\par \par \uc2 The Pima County Sheriff's Department formed a border-crimes unit in April 2007 after bandits shot two illegal immigrants to death. Among the 18-deputy unit's goals is to monitor bandit activity, said Sgt. Gilbert Dominguez, a supervisor of the unit.\par \par \uc2 "To prevent them from running the area themselves, you have to provide a law-enforcement presence in connection to Border Patrol to provide protection for those citizens who live out there and for those illegal immigrants who are victimized," Dominguez said.\par \par \uc2 As a Border Patrol agent working in Douglas in the 1970s, Lee Morgan regularly chased after border bandits who broke into homes and took the loot south.\par \par \uc2 Back then, they were called "border burglars," and they carried knives or shivs, said Morgan, who retired in 2006 after 31 years as a federal law-enforcement official with the Justice, Treasury and Homeland Security departments.\par \par \uc2 The rip crews became more violent in the 1980s and 1990s as they started working for the Mexican drug cartels and corrupt Mexican cops, Morgan said. They began carrying guns instead of knives, and during the mid-1990s bandits broke into homes in Bisbee and Naco and assaulted residents, he said.\par \par \uc2 "They have progressively gotten worse in Arizona from the 1970s to the 1990s to where you are at now," Morgan said.\par \par \uc2 Two kinds of bandits\par \par \uc2 Today, there are two main types of bandits - crews that try to rip off drug loads and those that try to rob illegal immigrants, said Lt. Raoul Rodriguez, operations division commander with the Santa Cruz County Sheriff's Office.\par \par \uc2 The crews usually consist of three to five men, dressed in dark clothes or fatigues, often wearing ski masks, Rodriguez said. They carry assault rifles or handguns.\par \par \uc2 Groups that target illegal immigrants will usually pop up close to the border, demanding money and valuables and warning the people that they will kill them if they look back. Assaults and sexual assaults are commonplace. Crews that rip off drugs usually do it farther north, often 15 to 30 miles north of the border.\par \par \uc2 The bandits robbing illegal immigrants are often independent criminals based in Tucson or Phoenix who were on the fringe of drug trafficking and who have banded together, Coulson said.\par \par \uc2 In the last year, Mexican drug-smuggling organizations have begun using bandit crews to police their desert smuggling routes, ensuring that competitors are not using their trails, Coulson said.\par \par \uc2 "You don't want independents out there running dope," Coulson said. "They are not paying the tax; they are not paying their dues for running that corridor."\par \par \uc2 UNCERTAIN FUTURE\par \par \uc2 Law enforcement officials are split on whether the fatal shooting of agent Terry is a sign that more violence is inevitable.\par \par \uc2 The paradigm on the border has long been that it was bad business for drug smugglers to harm or kill U.S. agents because it would bring unwanted attention that would make it more difficult to move their marijuana. Shooters have often been killed by angry cartel bosses upon their return to Mexico.\par \par \uc2 "I'm hoping that it's going to be an isolated incident," said Lt. Rodriguez of Santa Cruz County. "It's not a very smart move to engage law enforcement the way they do in Mexico."\par \par \uc2 But Pima County Sgt. Dominguez said he expects there to be more shootouts with bandits. And Coulson is even more worried.

The FBI has taken over the investigation, but the Santa Cruz Sheriff's Office learned the following about the incident:\par \par \uc2 It began when agents with the Border Patrol's horse patrol came upon a group of 12 illegal immigrants in the canyon. The group fled from the agents and one man got knocked down, either by tripping or being bumped by a horse, Estrada said.\par \par \uc2 Shortly after, an agent shot the man on the ground, according to a woman who witnessed the events. She was one of 11 illegal immigrants apprehended by the Border Patrol.\par \par \uc2 It's unknown if the Border Patrol agent intentionally or accidentally shot the man, Estrada said. The agent might have been trying to rein in the horse when the shots were fired, he said. He was shot at least once in the abdomen, Estrada said.\par \par \uc2 "We are not saying that he was shot intentionally," Estrada said. "We are just saying that he was shot."\par \par \uc2 Due the remoteness of the location, the Border Patrol had to walk the wounded man out of the rugged area to a spot where a helicopter could land.\par \par \uc2 The 30-year-old man from Nogales, Sonora, was flown to University Medical Center in Tucson where he was in intensive care Tuesday evening, said Julian Etienne, spokesman for the Mexican Consulate in Tucson.

Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 From congressional races to the gubernatorial showdown, border issues have taken center stage in many campaigns this election season.\par \par \uc2 If you are dizzy from all the talk and rhetoric, you're not alone. So today, we sort out some of the most popular election- season facts, myths and half-truths:\par \par \uc2 Is the border more dangerous than ever?\par \par \uc2 Answer: For people illegally crossing it, yes. For people living near it in Mexico, probably. For people living on the U.S. side of the border, probably not.\par \par \uc2 Some will vehemently disagree with that last statement, pointing to the March killing of Cochise County rancher Robert Krentz and an increase in burglaries in the Portal area as evidence that the level of danger on the U.S. side of the border has increased. But while Cochise County investigators say they tracked footprints back to Mexico, the Krentz crime is unsolved.\par \par \uc2 The FBI's uniform crime reports show violent crime is no more prevalent in border cities than in nonborder cities.\par \par \uc2 Since 2001, the average violent-crime rate in eight border cities declined, and it has remained below the national violent-crime rate since 2005, said an August 2010 report by the Congressional Research Center, which reviewed FBI crime reports from 1998 to 2008.\par \par \uc2 In Tucson and Phoenix - the two largest cities on the smuggling route through Arizona - murder and violent crime decreased from 2005 to 2009, FBI data show.\par \par \uc2 The ratio of assaults on Border Patrol agents dipped 36 percent across the Southwest border from 2007 to 2010. But that ratio increased by 70 percent in the Tucson Sector over the same period. Most of the reported assaults are when rocks are thrown at agents.\par \par \uc2 The danger of crossing the border illegally has increased, though. Illegal immigrants are dying at greater rates than ever in Arizona, likely because the border buildup has prompted smugglers to lead crossers into more remote and dangerous areas.\par \par \uc2 The 252 illegal border crossers found dead along Arizona's stretch of the U.S.-Mexico border excluding Yuma in fiscal 2010 broke the previous record of 234, set in 2007.\par \par \uc2 Is Arizona the epicenter for illegal immigration?\par \par \uc2 Answer: Yes and no.\par \par \uc2 Arizona's stretch of the U.S.-Mexico border is the busiest for illegal immigration, drug smuggling and border deaths, accounting for more than half of all arrests and marijuana seizures. But the state is more of a transit point than a destination.\par \par \uc2 The estimate of 375,000 illegal immigrants living in Arizona puts the state eighth in the U.S. behind California, Texas, Florida, New York, Illinois, New Jersey and Georgia, a September report from the Pew Hispanic Center found.\par \par \uc2 And the number of illegal immigrants living in Arizona dropped from an estimated 475,000 in 2008, the Pew report found.\par \par \uc2 But Arizona has thrust itself into the national spotlight on this issue due to the numerous immigration-enforcement laws passed by the state, including SB 1070.\par \par \uc2 Has the federal government really done nothing to secure the border?\par \par \uc2 Answer: You can question the effectiveness of the billions spent, but there's no denying the massive buildup of border enforcement over the last five to 10 years:\par \par \uc2 * The budget for Customs and Border Protection - the Department of Homeland Security agency responsible for border security - soared to $11.4 billion in fiscal 2010, up 90 percent from $6 billion in fiscal year 2004. That's nearly twice the growth of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) budget, which increased 54 percent to $5.7 billion in fiscal 2010, up from $3.7 billion in 2004. ICE is responsible for immigration enforcement at worksites and across the interior of the country.\par \par \uc2 * The number of Border Patrol agents on the U.S.-Mexico border has increased to 17,500, up from 9,700 in 2004. The Tucson Sector, which stretches from New Mexico to Yuma County, now has 3,300 agents, up from 2,100 in 2004 and 1,500 in 2000.\par \par \uc2 * The miles of fencing along the border have grown exponentially. There are now 350 miles of pedestrian fence and 299 miles of vehicle barriers along the U.S.-Mexico border, for a total of 649 miles of barriers. That's up from 143 miles of barriers in 2006.\par \par \uc2 The Tucson Sector has 71 miles of pedestrian fences and 139 miles of vehicle barriers. In 2000, it had 11 miles of pedestrian fences and two miles of vehicle barriers.\par \par \uc2 Pedestrian fences are 12- to 18-foot-high barriers designed to stop, or at least slow down, people. Vehicle barriers are waist- to chest-high and are designed to stop cars.\par \par \uc2 * The agency has spent more than $1 billion since 2006 developing the SBInet "virtual fence," which tracks movement using a network of towers mounted with cameras, sensors and radar. But the program has been plagued by delays and glitches.\par \par \uc2 * In the past five years, the feds have twice sent the National Guard to the border to assist the Border Patrol. In Operation Jump Start, from 2006 to 2008, the government spent $1.2 billion to send 6,000 National Guard troops. In the current Operation Copper Cactus, the government is spending $135 million to send 1,200 troops.\par \par \uc2 * Homeland Security has devoted $225 million to border law enforcement agencies through Operation Stonegarden, including about $51 million to Arizona agencies. The program gives agencies money to pay officers who work overtime shifts aimed at securing the border. The money also buys four-wheel-drive trucks, radios and night- vision goggles.\par \par \uc2 Has the buildup of agents, fences and technology made the border more secure?\par \par \uc2 Answer: Probably, but to what degree is uncertain.\par \par \uc2 Fewer illegal immigrants are crossing the Southwest border, but it's difficult to determine how much of that is attributed to the buildup, because the decrease has coincided with the worst U.S. recession since the Depression.\par \par \uc2 The number of apprehensions by Border Patrol agents on the U.S.- Mexico border plummeted to 447,500 in fiscal year 2010, down from 1.1 million in fiscal year 2004.\par \par \uc2 Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano acknowledges that the weak economy helps explain why fewer people are getting caught crossing the border illegally, and she also credited crackdowns on employers who hire illegal workers. But she said a big reason is enforcement.\par \par \uc2 "The manpower, the technology, the infrastructure all has enabled us to be able to really slow that flow of \uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2  traffic," she said at a news conference last week near San Diego.\par \par \uc2 Citing the seizures of more drugs, weapons and illicit cash along the Mexican border, Napolitano said: "We now have a border more secure than ever before."\par \par \uc2 But using the same rationale the feds apply to apprehensions - the lower the better - the buildup has not slowed the smuggling of drugs. Marijuana seizures along the U.S.-Mexico border by Border Patrol agents have increased to 2.5 million pounds in fiscal year 2009, up from 1.3 million in 2004.\par \par \uc2 So many people say, 'Build more fence.' Does it work?\par \par \uc2 Answer: Nobody knows for sure.\par \par \uc2 A 2009 report from the Government Accountability Office found that "despite a $2.4 billion investment to build 264 miles of fencing and 226 miles of vehicle barriers in the last five years, the impact of these barriers on border security is unknown because it has not been measured."\par \par \uc2 Proponents of border fencing point to double-layer fencing in San Diego and Yuma as proof that barriers work. Apprehensions dipped there after the fences went up, but the smugglers simply moved their routes.\par \par \uc2 The Border Patrol's 262-mile-long Tucson Sector has 71 miles of fencing, but it remains the busiest people- and drug-smuggling route on the border, accounting for nearly half of all arrests and marijuana seizures.\par \par \uc2 The problem with fences is that motivated smugglers and border crossers find ways over, through and around them. Critics call them nothing more than a speed bump. And the international border's diverse terrain, which includes mountains, canyons and rivers, makes a 2,000-mile fence impossible.\par \par \uc2 Border Patrol officials acknowledge that the barriers are not a panacea. But they say they deter, slow and funnel traffic, helping agents gain the upper hand in the ongoing cat-and-mouse game with smugglers.\par \par \uc2 The government has spent $2.4 billion on new fences, and the GAO estimates the life-cycle cost of all the barriers to be $6.5 billion.\par \par \uc2 The buildup of fences and roads along the border could have environmental consequences, too. Fencing has caused flooding and erosion, and it could be fragmenting wildlife habitat.\par \par \uc2 Virtual fences are better for the environment, but despite more than $1 billion spent over five years, the SBInet program has been plagued by glitches and major delays, and has yet to produce a working system. The GAO has questioned whether the time and money spent are a prudent use of limited resources.\par \par \uc2 Has violence from Mexico's raging drug wars spilled over the border?\par \par \uc2 Answer: It's not entirely clear, but most indicators say no.\par \par \uc2 The public shootouts, beheadings and killings that are part of life in northern Mexico due to the ongoing turf battles between drug cartels do not occur in Arizona. But some violence in Arizona may be associated with the illegal smuggling of people and drugs.\par \par \uc2 And there's no way to say spillover violence won't happen.\par \par \uc2 "Currently, U.S. federal officials deny that the recent increase in drug-trafficking-related violence in Mexico has resulted in a spillover into the United States," said an August 2010 report from the Congressional Research Center. "But they acknowledge that the prospect is a serious concern."\par \par \uc2 Is it possible to seal the border?\par \par \uc2 Answer: Probably not.\par \par \uc2 There are some who believe it's possible, such as the Border Patrol agents' union. But even the commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection says the focus should be on controlling the border, not sealing it.\par \par \uc2 "This is not about sealing the border," Commissioner Alan Bersin said in September while in Tucson. "Until we have a legitimate labor market between Mexico and the United States, people will attempt to come here to work."\par \par \uc2 History shows that as long as better-paying jobs await in the U.S., people from Mexico and Latin America will continue to find a way around, through, under and over the gantlet of enforcement.\par \par \uc2 Not even the worst U.S. recession since the Depression has stopped the stream of illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Contact reporter Brady McCombs at 573-4213 or bmccombs@azstarnet.com The Associated Press contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 On StarNet: Find extensive coverage of immigration issues at azstarnet.com/border\par \par \uc2 Document TUCS000020101127e6ao0000y\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 NEWS\par {\*\bkmkstart toc23}{\*\bkmkend toc23}\b \uc2 Illegal entrants are focus of debate\b0\par\par\uc2 ANDREA KELLY   \par \uc2 ANDREA KELLY, ARIZONA DAILY STAR\par \uc2 682 \uc2 words\par \uc2 19 October 2010\par \uc2 The Arizona Daily Star\par \uc2 TUCS\par \uc2 FINAL\par A1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2010 The Arizona Daily Star.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Giffords, Kelly clash over 'amnesty' issue\par \par \uc2 In the first debate between candidates running for Congress in Arizona's border District 8, immigration was front and center.\par \par \uc2 The first three questions about amnesty and checkpoints took up nearly a quarter of the hour-long face-off Monday between incumbent Democrat U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, Republican challenger Jesse Kelly and Libertarian challenger Steve Stoltz.\par \par \uc2 The first question to Giffords was about her support for a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 "I don't support amnesty. No one supports amnesty; that's what President Reagan supported," she said. What she supports is the STRIVE Act, which also was sponsored by Republican U.S. Sens. John McCain and Jon Kyl, and Republican U.S. Rep. Jeff Flake, she said.\par \par \uc2 That bill allowed illegal immigrants who, among other things, paid back taxes, fees and fines, and passed a criminal background check, to qualify for citizenship, she said.\par \par \uc2 "You do all of those things - welcome to America," she said.\par \par \uc2 Kelly said the STRIVE Act was, in fact, amnesty. He said the government needs to build a double-layer border fence, and criticized Giffords for "defunding the border fence," referring to a vote Giffords cast against a bill involving funding for the fence. Giffords said the legislation would have taken money from high-tech security measures and put it toward the border fence, which was already funded in a different measure.\par \par \uc2 "What do we have, we have a checkpoint on I-19, and 50 percent of the drugs that come into the United States come through Arizona," Kelly said.\par \par \uc2 Stoltz had a simplified take on citizenship for immigrants.\par \par \uc2 "My rapid path to citizenship is anybody who understands the Constitution should be a citizen if they have a good understanding of English," he said.\par \par \uc2 Entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare need to be eliminated, and mixing national troops with local troops is unconstitutional, he said.\par \par \uc2 Kelly was asked how much money needs to be spent studying the effectiveness of checkpoints before a decision is made on whether to keep them.\par \par \uc2 "How much more money needs to be spent? Well, tell me how many more liberals we're going to elect to Washington, D.C.," he said.\par \par \uc2 Kelly said he does not support the DREAM Act, a provision in the STRIVE Act that would have allowed some \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  minors the opportunity for citizenship if they met certain criteria, including getting a college degree or serving in the military.\par \par \uc2 "I do not support the DREAM Act. The path to citizenship begins in your country of citizenship," Kelly said.\par \par \uc2 Giffords said the idea is a "realistic approach" and a "tremendous opportunity" for people who would qualify.\par \par \uc2 Stoltz said the proposal sounded nice but had hidden "gotcha" implications.\par \par \uc2 In her closing statement, Giffords said Kelly used the word "Arizona" a single time during the debate.\par \par \uc2 "I'm not sure who he wants to represent, but it's not us," she said.\par \par \uc2 In response, after the debate, Kelly said, "I said Arizona once; she bankrupted Arizona once," referring to her budget votes in the Legislature before she went to Congress, something he also mentioned during the debate.\par \par \uc2 "She joined with Janet Napolitano to bankrupt the state, then moved on to the federal government to join with (President) Obama and (House Speaker Nancy) Pelosi to bankrupt the country," he said during the debate.\par \par \uc2 The crowd filled 1,300 chairs in the University of Arizona ballroom, and some watched video of the event in an overflow room. People gathered hours before the debate to wave signs and wait in line for seats. The audience also frequently broke into shouts, boos and applause, drowning out the candidates in the debate.\par \par \uc2 Contact reporter Andrea Kelly at akelly@azstarnet.com or 807- 7790.\par \par \uc2 On StarNet: Join a Nov. 2 election-night live chat on StarNet for discussion, updates, a scoreboard of major races, and fun with cartoonist David Fitzsimmons.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 A Tucson man scheduled for deportation today will be able to stay long enough to see his daughter graduate from high school after receiving a one-year federal deferral.\par \par \uc2 Alfonso Morales-Macias, a 40-year-old father of two who has has lived illegally in the U.S. for 20 years, learned Wednesday night that he won't be deported to Mexico, said Phoenix attorney Mel Rodis, who led a campaign to help him.\par \par \uc2 No one was more happy than his daughter, Ana Morales, 18, a senior at Sunnyside High School. She and her brother, 11-year-old Alfonso Morales Jr., were born in Tucson and are U.S. citizens.\par \par \uc2 "I'm really happy because he's going to be able to stay with us and he's going to be here for my graduation in May," said Morales, who hopes to study to be a veterinarian at the University of Arizona.\par \par \uc2 Morales-Macias is the second \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  living in Tucson who has been granted a once-rare deferral from deportation in the last two months. In early August, Marlen Moreno Peralta, a 28-year- old mother of two, was granted one-year deferred action on deportation orders.\par \par \uc2 Both Tucsonans appear to be among a growing contingent of illegal immigrants who are being allowed to stay in the U.S. because they were either brought here as children, like Moreno, or who have been living here since 1996, like Morales-Macias.\par \par \uc2 A leaked internal memo from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services that surfaced during the summer reveals a suggestion to provide relief to two groups of illegal immigrants facing deportation: people brought here as children who would qualify for the DREAM (Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors) Act, and people who have been living here continuously since 1996. The year is a move that would bump up the qualifying date from Jan. 1, 1972, in a section of immigration law.\par \par \uc2 "Rather than making deferred action widely available to hundreds of thousands and as a non-legislative version of 'amnesty,' USCIS could tailor the use of this discretionary option for particular groups," the memo said.\par \par \uc2 Morales-Macias came to the U.S. more than two decades ago on a tourist visa and overstayed. He would fit into the second category for deferral. Moreno came to the U.S. illegally with her parents when she was 13 years old. She'd qualify under the DREAM Act, which was rejected this week by the Senate. Moreno was facing deportation stemming from a identity-theft case arrest at a north-side \uc2 Panda Express\uc2  restaurant in 2008.\par \par \uc2 Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials didn't divulge why Morales-Macias was given a deferral, but agency spokesman Vincent Picard said in an e-mailed statement that deferred action is one tool used to make sure the agency is using its limited resources to "achieve the greatest impact under the immigration laws." The agency focuses deportation efforts on criminal illegal immigrants, recent border violators and people who try to abuse the system through fraud, he said.\par \par \uc2 The agency considers several factors when deciding whom it grants deferred status to, including criminal history, immigration history and equities in the U.S., he said. The deferred action doesn't give Morales-Macias legal status, but it gives him more time to "normalize his status," Picard said.\par \par \uc2 Morales-Macias' attorney, Margo Cowan, said she doesn't know if he was chosen because he fits into the category outlined in the leaked memo or simply because he's an exemplary man with great kids. Immigration officials have long had the discretion to grant relief for cases such as his, she said.\par \par \uc2 The action, which will allow Morales-Macias to work legally, can be renewed for an additional year. But he still faces an uncertain future because his wife does not have legal status either, meaning he has no avenue to apply for legal residence.\par \par \uc2 "We're hoping there will be comprehensive immigration reform," Rodis said.\par \par \uc2 He said Morales-Macias and his wife came to Tucson 20 years ago from Nayarit, Mexico, with tourist visas. He has no criminal record and is an avid churchgoer, and his children are both outstanding students, Rodis said. Their son, Alfonso Morales Jr., is in the sixth grade at Sierra Middle School, where he is a student body treasurer and is in the gifted and talented classes.\par \par \uc2 "Someone who has been here for 20 years, a taxpayer, a hard worker, a homeowner, deserves to be here," Rodis said. "Deporting him would have been a miscarriage of justice."\par \par \uc2 Morales-Macias' troubles began in September 2007, when he was arrested by immigration agents while working for a contracted janitorial service at a Tucson Target store, Rodis said. After being held in detention, he posted an immigration bond that allowed him to stay with his family while he and his attorney challenged his deportation. But he had exhausted all of his options, and he was set to be deported today.\par \par \uc2 "We are all so happy that I can stay here," Morales-Macias said Thursday. "More than anything, this is for my daughter."\par \par \uc2 In the cases of both Morales-Macias and Moreno, Southern Arizona humanitarian groups launched campaigns that included phone calls, e- mails and faxes to the Department of Homeland Security asking for a reprieve. In both cases, news of the deferral came just days after supporters held news conferences to garner more support for their cases.\par \par \uc2 It's possible that the Obama administration is handpicking sympathetic people such as Moreno and Morales-Macias to grant deferral to gain favor with immigrant advocates while avoiding alienating mainstream voters who favor more immigration enforcement, said Steve Camarota, director of research for the Center for Immigration Studies, a Washington-based organization that advocates for slowing immigration.\par \par \uc2 "It's one guy; he's pretty sympathetic; nobody notices that much," Camarota said. "Whereas for the advocacy group that is pushing for it, and for this one guy, it means a lot."\par \par \uc2 Camarota said he's not opposed to selecting certain deserving people for pardons, but the problem is that too many people are manipulating the system. He points to the fact that there are still 500,000 fugitive illegal immigrants in the U.S. who were given deportation orders and never showed up.\par \par \uc2 "The basic idea of tempering justice with mercy is sound and we ought to have it, and this guy may well qualify," Camarota said. "But the rule of law is being mocked. The rule of law is so weak that we don't need to be thinking about making exceptions."\par \par \uc2 Contact reporter Brady McCombs at 573-4213 or bmccombs@azstarnet.com\par \par \uc2 On StarNet: Find extensive coverage of immigration issues at azstarnet.com/border\par \par \uc2 Leaked memo\par \par \uc2 This section from a leaked memo from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, titled "Administrative Alternatives to Comprehensive Immigration Reform," might explain why Alfonso Morales- Macias was granted a deferral from deportation:\par \par \uc2 "While it is theoretically possible to grant deferred action to an unrestricted number of unlawfully present individuals, doing so would likely be controversial, not to mention expensive. Presently no specific application form or fee is required to request or receive deferred action. Were USCIS to increase significantly the use of deferred action, the agency would either require a separate appropriation or independent funding stream. Alternatively, USCIS could design and seek expedited approval of a dedicated deferred action form and require a filing fee.\par \par \uc2 "Rather than making deferred action widely available to hundreds of thousands and as a non-legislative version of 'amnesty,' USCIS could tailor the use of this discretionary option for particular groups such as individuals who would be eligible for relief under the DREAM Act (an estimated 50,000), or under Section 249 of the Act (Registry), who have resided in the U.S. since 1996 (or as of a different date designed to move forward the Registry provision now limited to entries before January 1, 1972)."\par \par \uc2 Document TUCS000020101005e69o0005r\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 NEWS\par {\*\bkmkstart toc28}{\*\bkmkend toc28}\b \uc2 US allows new water stations by border\b0\par\par\uc2 BRADY MCCOMBS   \par \uc2 BRADY MCCOMBS, ARIZONA DAILY STAR\par \uc2 1,077 \uc2 words\par \uc2 4 September 2010\par \uc2 The Arizona Daily Star\par \uc2 TUCS\par \uc2 FINAL\par A1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2010 The Arizona Daily Star.

"You have a blueprint to do it."\par \par \uc2 Humanitarian groups put out water in an effort to save lives. Nearly 2,000 illegal borders crossers have been found dead in Arizona since 2001, and this year has been one of the worst yet.\par \par \uc2 The ruling didn't go over well with all Southern Arizona humanitarian aid groups, though. It prohibits the methods used by No More Deaths and Samaritans. They put out water in one-gallon jugs along trails.\par \par \uc2 "We are not pleased," said Gene Lefebvre, a retired minister and co-founder of No More Deaths. "We are not going to take any big action, but we are not pleased."\par \par \uc2 No More Deaths officials are upset because they reached a compromise with Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge and Fish and Wildlife officials earlier this year that said they would be able to put 1-gallon waters jugs at specified locations as long as they were tethered to trees.\par \par \uc2 The deal culminated a nearly two-year standoff between the two sides that included 15 volunteers being issued littering tickets for putting out the jugs. After the compromise was reached, a federal prosecutor asked the court to dismiss charges against 13 people who had been cited.\par \par \uc2 In the Fish and Wildlife draft compatibility determination issued in April, the agency said it was "evaluating" allowing more water stations, from 1-gallon to 55 gallons. It said the stations could be placed "strategically" on or near existing trails.\par \par \uc2 But following an agency review and public comment period where they received more than 1,100 comments from 811 people, Fish and Wildlife officials concluded the 1-gallon jugs were not the best approach, said agency spokesman Jose Viramontes.\par \par \uc2 One reason was concern about litter.\par \par \uc2 "If an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  is not carrying his or her own container, there is a possibility that tethered containers could be cut from the tether, carried along the trail and later discarded on the refuge," the document says. "Hundreds of unpermitted 1-gallon containers previously deposited (not tethered) on \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  trails have been found discarded throughout the refuge."\par \par \uc2 Another concern was that putting out water on existing smuggling trails could promote more illegal traffic through the refuge, Viramontes said.\par \par \uc2 "It may actually promote passage through the refuge," Viramontes said.\par \par \uc2 Lefebvre and fellow No More Deaths volunteer Dan Millis scoffed at that contention. Millis called it "ridiculous to say our water lures people anywhere." Millis had his 2008 littering conviction overturned by a federal appeals court.\par \par \uc2 "Our water is not what's causing people to come through the desert," said Millis, who works for the Grand Canyon Chapter of the Sierra Club. "The failed U.S. border policy of militarizing the border is what has caused people to come through the desert."\par \par \uc2 Lefebvre declined to say whether No More Deaths volunteers will continue to put out 1-gallon water jugs on the refuge, only saying, "We are just going ahead of with our work. We've got to stand by our commitment to give humanitarian aid to migrants."\par \par \uc2 Fish and Wildlife officials say they will continue to issue citations to people they observe not complying with the new guidelines. But Viramontes said the agency is hopeful there will be no more issues with No More Deaths volunteers.\par \par \uc2 "Our hope is that No More Deaths will come forward with some requests similar to this, so we can permit this activity," Viramontes said. "We are open to more water stations on the refuge."\par \par \uc2 But while No More Deaths is pleased that Humane Borders may be able to set up more stationary water stations they still believe the 1-gallon jugs are the best tool in remote terrain, Lefebvre said.\par \par \uc2 Humane Borders' new executive director, Sofia Gomez, said the organization is currently re-assessing the locations of all of its 38 water stations in Arizona to make sure they are in locations being used by illegal immigrants. They are looking at their own data of water usage and other data from No More Deaths, the Border Patrol and the Pima County Medical Examiner's Office, she said.\par \par \uc2 "We are working to assess our water distribution," Gomez said. "Where we need to be now versus where we were when we started out 10 years ago."\par \par \uc2 It's possible they'll ask for additional water stations on the Buenos Aires refuge but they haven't made that decision yet, she said. They may also ask to put their blue flags on existing water wells, Gomez said. The organization is pleased with the rules, and said they just need to clarify a few of the stipulations.\par \par \uc2 Hoover said No More Deaths should put their energies toward fighting to get permission to put out water stations on the Tohono O'odham Reservation and other dangerous lands.\par \par \uc2 "They are fighting a good battle to put water in the desert, but they are fighting the wrong battle when they are fighting over the size of the water container," Hoover said.\par \par \uc2 Humane Borders restarted conversations with Tohono O'odham Nation officials this summer about putting water stations out there but nothing has changed yet, Gomez said.\par \par \uc2 More bodies are found along the 75 miles of international border the Tohono O'odham Nation shares with Mexico than any other stretch of Arizona's border. But the nation has never allowed humanitarian groups to put out water stations.\par \par \uc2 Contact reporter Brady McCombs at 573-4213 or bmccombs@.com.\par \par \uc2 On StarNet: Find extensive coverage of border and immigration issues at azstarnet.com/border\par \par \uc2 Document TUCS000020100918e69400016\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 TUCSON/REGION\par {\*\bkmkstart toc29}{\*\bkmkend toc29}\b \uc2 Law & Order Briefs\b0\par\par\uc2 ARIZONA DAILY STAR\par \uc2 460 \uc2 words\par \uc2 5 August 2010\par \uc2 The Arizona Daily Star\par \uc2 TUCS\par \uc2 FINAL\par A6\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2010 The Arizona Daily Star.

Wong, who serves on the Arizona Power Plant and Transmission Line Siting Committee, said utility-operated solar power plants are important, but he's concerned with water usage.\par \par \uc2 Burns said she strongly supports the renewable standard, but amid concerns surcharges are getting too high, she said she would look for other ways to fund the program, though she didn't have specifics.\par \par \uc2 "We need to make sure the ratepayer is getting the economic and environmental benefit," she said, adding she hopes falling prices for solar equipment will help drive future installations without the need for rebates.\par \par \uc2 Pierce said the standard is fine the way it is, and the market will dictate any increase in the standard.\par \par \uc2 "That's the way this is intended to go, that we'd reduce and remove subsidies because renewables become a way of life," he said.\par \par \uc2 All three Republicans said they would revisit commission decisions in APS and TEP rate cases which changed the rules for extending power lines to new homes, shifting thousands of dollars in costs for each line to developers or homeowners.\par \par \uc2 Addressing complaints the extension costs are stifling rural development, the commission is currently holding statewide public meetings on the issue.\par \par \uc2 "It's really harming rural Arizona, because what the commission decided was, new customers were not of value, and that's simply not the case," Pierce said.\par \par \uc2 Pierce said that after initially voting for the first APS rate case that cut the extensions, he has since tried to restore the free extension footage and pushed for the current public discussions.\par \par \uc2 Burns said she is closely monitoring the public meetings on the extension issue and is concerned about the impact on development.\par \par \uc2 Wong said he's heard some of the complaints and is committed to finding a "middle ground" that would help rural development while protecting ratepayers.\par \par \uc2 All three Republicans say they oppose - and the state should oppose - a move by the federal government to impose any kind of "carbon tax" or cap-and-trade regulation on utilities and other industries.\par \par \uc2 Contact Assistant Business Editor David Wichner at dwichner@azstarnet.com or 573-4181.\par \par \uc2 CANDIDATEs' BACKGROUNDS\par \par \uc2 Brenda Burns\par \par \uc2 Home: Scottsdale\par \par \uc2 Age: 59\par \par \uc2 Occupation: Former real-estate agent and consultant\par \par \uc2 Political experience: State representative 1987 to 1994 (two years as majority leader) state senator, 1995 to 2002, (four years as president.)\par \par \uc2 Gary Pierce\par \par \uc2 Home: Mesa\par \par \uc2 Age: 57\par \par \uc2 Occupation: Corporation Commissioner; marketing consultant; former auto dealer.\par \par \uc2 Political experience: State representative, 2001-2006 (majority whip, 2005-2006); former Yuma County supervisor\par \par \uc2 Barry Wong\par \par \uc2 Home: Phoenix\par \par \uc2 Age: 51\par \par \uc2 Occupation: Business attorney\par \par \uc2 Political experience: State representative, 1993-2000; Corporation Commission appointed member, 2006\par \par \uc2 Document TUCS000020100810e67r00005\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 TUCSON/REGION\par {\*\bkmkstart toc32}{\*\bkmkend toc32}\b \uc2 Law & Order Briefs\b0\par\par\uc2 ARIZONA DAILY STAR\par \uc2 561 \uc2 words\par \uc2 23 July 2010\par \uc2 The Arizona Daily Star\par \uc2 TUCS\par \uc2 FINAL\par A6\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2010 The Arizona Daily Star.

The program's objective is to disrupt the smuggling cycle and save lives during the hottest months. It is currently going on for the seventh consecutive year.\par \par \uc2 The report says Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Homeland Security agency that runs the repatriation program, doesn't know whether it is effective "because it lacks performance measures for the program."\par \par \uc2 Further, it says "lack of accurate and consistent data" has limited the ability of Customs and Border Protection, parent agency of the Border Patrol, to evaluate its programs to curtail \uc2 illegal- immigrant\uc2  smuggling.\par \par \uc2 Homeland Security officials did not agree with the GAO's recommendation to measure the program's performance because the agency "believes that doing so would shift its focus away from the program's original lifesaving intent," the report says.\par \par \uc2 Since the binational Mexican Interior Repatriation Program began in 2004, the U.S. government has spent about $71 million to fly nearly 93,000 non-criminal Mexican illegal immigrants to Mexico City.\par \par \uc2 More than 1,850 illegal border crossers have been found dead in Arizona's desert in the last decade, with the yearly death toll hovering around 200 a year.\par \par \uc2 It's not the first time the effectiveness of the program has been questioned. A 2008 article by the Arizona Daily Star found that evidence showed the binational program had not made any substantial difference in border smuggling or desert deaths.\par \par \uc2 And two years earlier, the GAO concluded that the then 2-year- old program had done nothing to reduce desert deaths.\par \par \uc2 In addition to the recommendation regarding the repatriation program, this latest GAO report urges Homeland Security to study the possibility of expanding a program where ICE's Office of Detention and Removal Operations transports and processes apprehended illegal immigrants, freeing up ICE investigators to focus on targeting the smuggling organizations. The program has been used in Phoenix since 2006 but is not used elsewhere.\par \par \uc2 The GAO also recommended that the agency develop performance measures for its asset seizures and consider using financial investigative techniques used by the Arizona attorney general task force to disrupt smuggling operations by seizing assets.\par \par \uc2 "The task force seized millions of dollars and disrupted alien smuggling operations by following cash transactions flowing through money transmitters that serve as the primary method of payment to those individuals responsible for smuggling aliens," the report says.\par \par \uc2 Arizona Attorney General Terry Goddard spoke about these efforts during his testimony at Thursday's hearing.\par \par \uc2 "We need to recognize the seriousness and proximity of the cartel threat to American security and eliminate that threat quickly," said Goddard, according to his written testimony. "Perhaps the biggest failure of our national debate on border security is that the cartel threat seems to have taken a back seat to discussions about immigration. Yet, if we eliminate the cartel organizations, the ability of large numbers to illegally cross our Southwest border would be dramatically reduced."\par \par \uc2 Contact reporter Brady McCombs at 573-4213 or bmccombs@azstarnet.com\par \par \uc2 on the net\par \par \uc2 To read the GAO report, go to {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.gao.gov/cgi-bin/getrpt?GAO-10"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 www.gao.gov/cgi-bin/getrpt?GAO-10}}}\uc2 - 328\par \par \uc2 Document TUCS000020100805e67n00002\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 NEWS\par {\*\bkmkstart toc34}{\*\bkmkend toc34}\b \uc2 US suit jacks up drama over immigration law\b0\par\par\uc2 HOWARD FISCHER   \par \uc2 HOWARD FISCHER CAPITOL MEDIA SERVICES AND BRADY MCCOMBS,; ARIZONA DAILY STAR\par \uc2 2,068 \uc2 words\par \uc2 7 July 2010\par \uc2 The Arizona Daily Star\par \uc2 TUCS\par \uc2 FINAL\par A1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2010 The Arizona Daily Star.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Arizona accused of seeking to pre-empt, 'second-guess' federal policies\par \par \uc2 The federal government's lawsuit against the immigration enforcement law in Arizona magnified the divisiveness of SB 1070 and sets the stage for a milestone ruling that could resonate across the country.\par \par \uc2 The Obama administration's lawsuit Tuesday comes weeks before the law is to take effect and seeks to prevent other states from duplicating the measure.\par \par \uc2 SB 1070 "is pre-empted by federal law and therefore violates the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution," legal papers filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Phoenix contend. The lawsuit says the legislation conflicts with the federal government's need to balance the competing interests of enforcing federal immigration law with the country's diplomatic relations with other nations, including Mexico.\par \par \uc2 The law "attempts to second-guess federal policies and re-order federal priorities in the area of immigration enforcement and to directly regulate immigration and the condition of an alien's entry and presence in the United States despite the fact that those subjects are federal domains and do not involve any legitimate state interest," wrote Assistant Attorney General Tony West, who heads the civil division of the Department of Justice.\par \par \uc2 Five other lawsuits have been filed challenging the law, but none carries the weight of the suit filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Phoenix by the Department of Justice. The case will now be assigned to a judge who will decide whether to grant a preliminary injunction to temporarily block the law from taking effect on July 29 as scheduled.\par \par \uc2 While Gov. Jan Brewer and other supporters of the measure defend its constitutionality, one of Arizona's leading legal scholars is predicting the lawsuit will be enough to deliver a knockout blow to the law.\par \par \uc2 "There's a very realistic chance that this marks the end of SB 1070," said Gabriel "Jack" Chin, of the University of Arizona's James E. Rogers College of Law. "It's one thing for the ACLU and MALDEF to say that SB 1070 interferes with federal immigration authority, but it's not their direct concern. It's much more credible, much more powerful to have the United States come in and make the argument."\par \par \uc2 Chin predicts a judge will order an injunction and goes further to say the law will never go into effect.\par \par \uc2 "In order for Arizona to win, Arizona has to persuade a district judge that either Arizona or federal courts are in a better position to determine foreign policy concerns than the secretary of state and the federal government," said Chin, who has been reading statutes for 25 years. "And that's a tall order."\par \par \uc2 Pinal County Attorney James Walsh stopped short of predicting an outcome but said he also has serious doubts about the state law's constitutionality. He welcomed the lawsuit because it will provide a sorely-needed answer. Walsh said he believes a court could make a decision before the end of the month.\par \par \uc2 The federal filing may be stronger than the other five lawsuits pending, said Walsh, because none of the plaintiffs in those other claims may have legal standing or ability to show any specific harm on the issue of federal supremacy, something the federal government is not required to prove.\par \par \uc2 The law requires police to question those they have stopped for some other reason about their immigration status if there is "reasonable suspicion" they are in this country illegally. It also imposes criminal penalties on foreigners who fail to federally register or carry their immigration documents.\par \par \uc2 Other provisions make it a state crime for undocumented workers to seek employment in Arizona and for people to knowingly harbor or transport those who are illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 The Arizona Legislature passed the measure after years of frustration stemming from being ground zero for illegal immigration and drug smuggling. Arizona's section of U.S.-Mexico border accounts for nearly half of all illegal immigrants apprehended and marijuana seized in the U.S. There are an estimated 460,000 illegal immigrants living in the state.\par \par \uc2 Other states have said they want to take similar action - a scenario the government cited as a reason for bringing the lawsuit.\par \par \uc2 "The Constitution and the federal immigration laws do not permit the development of a patchwork of state and local immigration policies throughout the country," the suit says.\par \par \uc2 The lawsuit has only one purpose, said Sen. Russell Pearce, the Mesa Republican who crafted the law and pushed it through the Legislature. "This is about the Obamas' policy of nonenforcement," he said. "This interferes with their plan for amnesty."\par \par \uc2 The administration has no interest in dealing with illegal immigration itself and now wants to block Arizona from doing what the federal government refuses to do, Pearce said.\par \par \uc2 "They are complicit," Pearce said of the administration.\par \par \uc2 "They are aiding and abetting the enemy," Pearce said and are violating their oath of office. "They ought to be impeached."\par \par \uc2 Gov. Jan Brewer, in a prepared response, said she believes the law is "both reasonable and constitutional."\par \par \uc2 Brewer also rejected the contention that SB 1070 is preempted by federal law, saying it is "designed to complement, not supplant, enforcement of federal immigration laws."\par \par \uc2 "As a direct result of failed and inconsistent federal enforcement, Arizona is under attack from violent Mexican drug and immigrant smuggling cartels. Now, Arizona is under attack in federal court from President Obama and his Department of Justice," Brewer said. "Today's filing is nothing more than a massive waste of taxpayer funds."\par \par \uc2 Brewer said she was glad the federal lawsuit did not claim the law will lead to racial profiling, a claim in some of the five other lawsuits already filed challenging the law.\par \par \uc2 But that may be just a temporary victory: A top Justice Department official said Tuesday that racial profiling is a separate legal issue. He said that if SB 1070 does take effect as scheduled on July 29, his agency's civil-rights division will monitor how the law is implemented and, if necessary, file a separate action.\par \par \uc2 Kris Kobach, the University of Missouri-Kansas City law professor who helped draft the Arizona law, said he's not surprised by the Justice Department's challenge and called it "unnecessary."\par \par \uc2 He noted that the law already is being challenged by the American Civil Liberties Union and other groups opposed to the new statute.\par \par \uc2 "The issue was already teed up in the courts. There's no reason for the Justice Department to get involved. The Justice Department doesn't add anything by bringing their own lawsuit," Kobach said in an interview.\par \par \uc2 Central to the case is whether the Arizona law interferes with what West said is the need of the federal government to decide exactly how and when to enforce immigration laws.\par \par \uc2 "Assuring effective enforcement of the provisions against illegal immigration and unlawful presence is a highly important interest," wrote West, the assistant U.S. attorney general. "But it is not the singular goal of federal immigration laws."\par \par \uc2 West said the laws also take into account "uniquely national interests" like facilitating trade and commerce, welcoming foreign nationals who visit, and making sure the treatment of foreign nationals here "does not harm our foreign relations with the countries from which they come or jeopardize the treatment of U.S. citizens abroad."\par \par \uc2 Pearce said SB 1070 simply lets the state enforce existing federal immigration laws. But West said that's not the case.\par \par \uc2 For example, he said federal law does make it illegal to hire an undocumented worker. And there are separate laws aimed at would-be workers who present presenting fraudulent documents.\par \par \uc2 But nothing in any of those laws, West said, makes it a crime for an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  to seek work.\par \par \uc2 "In fact (Congress) decided that criminal sanctions for seeking or obtaining employment would run counter to the purposes of the immigration system," he wrote.\par \par \uc2 Pearce said West is off-base with his objections.\par \par \uc2 "It's a felony to hire them," Pearce said. "So it ought to be a crime to solicit."\par \par \uc2 West had similar problems with the requirement of police to check the immigration status of those they suspect are in this country illegally. At the same time, SB 1070 also says any legal Arizona resident can file suit against any official or agency that adopts or implements a policy that restricts enforcement of federal immigration laws.\par \par \uc2 He said that undermines what had been the discretion of police of whether to verify someone's immigration status. Nor was West convinced that the requirement for "reasonable suspicion" is sufficient to protect rights.\par \par \uc2 "Arizona's alien inspection scheme therefore will subject lawful aliens to the possibility of inquisitorial practices and police surveillance, a form of treatment which Congress has plainly guarded against in crafting a balanced, federally directed immigration enforcement scheme."\par \par \uc2 Both Brewer and Pearce also chided the Obama administration for what they see as a selective approach to claiming federal supremacy in enforcing immigration laws. Pearce said that ignores various local policies and practices that now instruct police not to inquire about someone's immigration status.\par \par \uc2 "These patchwork local 'sanctuary' policies instruct the police not to cooperate with federal immigration officials," Brewer said.\par \par \uc2 In a prepared statement, Attorney General Eric Holder said Arizonans "are understandably frustrated with illegal immigration." And he said the federal government has a responsibility to comprehensively address those concerns. "But diverting federal resources away from dangerous aliens such as terrorism suspects and aliens with criminal records will impact the entire country's safety," the statement said.\par \par \uc2 "Setting immigration policy and enforcing immigration laws is a national responsibility," Holder continued. "Seeking to address the issue through a patchwork of state laws will only create more problems than it solves."\par \par \uc2 The Associated Press contributed to this story.\par \par \uc2 Read the full text of the United States of America vs. the State of Arizona at azstarnet.com/pdf\par \par \uc2 We want to hear from you.

In the worst recent example, 21 people died Thursday in a shootout between smuggling gangs 12 miles south of the Arizona border.\par \par \uc2 * Rancher Robert Krentz was murdered and Pinal County Deputy Louis Puroll was shot - both possibly by smugglers - as the state debated SB 1070.\par \par \uc2 * The anti-government sentiment that has colored Obama's tenure found a comfortable home in the border-security debate. Many candidates and voters blame the federal government for doing too little to secure the U.S.-Mexico border.\par \par \uc2 * Janet Napolitano's departure from the governor's seat let the Republican legislation escape her prolific veto stamp and become law.\par \par \uc2 * Former U.S. Rep. J.D. Hayworth challenged Sen. John McCain in the Republican primary, confronting McCain on border and immigration issues. McCain responded with an intense effort to build credentials as a border-security hawk.\par \par \uc2 The issue has been near the top of Arizona voters' priority list for more than a decade, Republican pollster Margaret Kenski said.\par \par \uc2 "I think the widespread perception is that the border is not secure, that it's fairly porous. That's what people are responding to," she said.\par \par \uc2 More officers on the border\par \par \uc2 More law enforcement officers than ever are patrolling Arizona's southern border, including increasing numbers who aren't Border Patrol agents.\par \par \uc2 One of them is Pima County Sheriff's Deputy Scott Woodworth. One night in late June, he stopped his duty vehicle, a Chevrolet Tahoe, on unpaved West Silverbell Road, about 40 miles northwest of downtown Tucson. He pulled out a sandwich, his dinner, and took in the quiet, moonlit evening while he waited.\par \par \uc2 It's often quiet like this for Woodworth, one of 18 members of the Pima County Sheriff's Department's border crime unit. He and the other members go to the remote regions of the county looking for drug smugglers, lost border crossers, stolen vehicles and loads of money headed south.\par \par \uc2 Working the border these days can be boring, but it is seldom lonely.\par \par \uc2 During his shift, Woodworth stayed in contact with members of his squad, who were scouring an area farther west, near the Tohono O'odham Nation. He also ran into a Bureau of Land Management ranger on Ironwood National Monument and two Marana police officers out patrolling the remote areas as part of the federal Operation Stonegarden, which pays local law-enforcement officers to patrol border areas.\par \par \uc2 The Border Patrol's Tucson sector employs about 3,200 agents, more than double the number it had eight years ago. Add to that agents sent in temporarily from different sectors, sheriff's deputies in border counties, rangers on federal lands, officers working Stonegarden assignments and a temporary National Guard deployment. Arizona's border is patrolled more heavily than ever.\par \par \uc2 Thanks to hundreds more agents and miles of new fencing, the entire Yuma Sector is considered under "operational control," said sector spokesman Kenneth Quillin, a supervisory Border Patrol agent.\par \par \uc2 In the Tucson Sector, agents have gained "operational control" of several segments of the border, said Brandon Judd, president of the agents' union local. Assignments in and near the border towns, where the main objective is to maintain control by deterring crossings, can be inactive.\par \par \uc2 "It's insanely boring," Judd said.\par \par \uc2 Apprehensions of illegal immigrants in the Arizona's two Border Patrol sectors peaked at about 590,000 in 2004 and dropped to about 249,000 last year. There is wide agreement that the drop reflects a steep decrease in attempts to cross, due mostly to the recession but also to increased enforcement.\par \par \uc2 "There really has been a huge drop of inflows in undocumented immigrants and especially Mexican immigrants," said Jeff Passel, senior demographer at the Pew Hispanic Center.\par \par \uc2 Border hot spots\par \par \uc2 But there still is action along Arizona's border. Judd points to the Huachuca Mountains, the corridor near the Chiricahua Mountains and some routes through the Tohono O'odham Nation as hot spots.\par \par \uc2 Rancher and cowboy poet Bud Strom is out on his property near the southern end of the Huachucas daily, and he says the illegal traffic has slowed dramatically in the year or so since the federal government finished a nearby 18-foot-high border fence. Pedestrian crossings of his ranch, which he had estimated at 1,000 per week, have dwindled to 50 to 100, Strom said. Vehicles no longer cross there.\par \par \uc2 "But it still ticks me off that they leave trash on the ranch," he said.\par \par \uc2 While Strom counts crossers by the dozens, Pam Saxman and her husband can count incidents on one hand in the four years since they moved from central Tucson to the remote hills in the western Avra Valley. Someone tried to steal a horse once, and recently a group of 40 people approached their home, about 70 miles north of the border. Still, that irks her.\par \par \uc2 "I don't think any of it's tolerable," she said.\par \par \uc2 Robert Krentz was working his family's ranch northeast of Douglas, in one of those hot corridors, when he was shot and killed March 27. Authorities don't know who attacked Krentz, but he radioed before he was killed that he was going to check on an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  he had encountered.\par \par \uc2 The killing happened amid a rash of burglaries around nearby Portal that residents attributed to cross-border criminals. And it happened as the state was debating SB 1070, which requires law enforcement officers to check the immigration status of people whom they question for another reason if they have reasonable suspicion that those people are in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 After Krentz's slaying, "candidates immediately jumped on the bandwagon," said Jennifer Allen, executive director of the Tucson- based Border Action Network, which works on behalf of legal and illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Attorney General Terry Goddard, the only Democrat in the governor's race, speculated on television after the slaying that the killer was "a trained professional."\par \par \uc2 "These are commandos, these are paramilitary professionals who unfortunately are throughout the high desert in Southern Arizona," he said, clarifying later that he was supposing this to be true.\par \par \uc2 Krentz's murder galvanized support for SB 1070, partly because "he was a rancher on his own property, minding his own business," said Tucsonan John Munger, who dropped out of the race for governor in May.\par \par \uc2 Napolitano, who vetoed a record 180 bills as governor, would have vetoed the law had she not become Obama's secretary of homeland security, Munger said. But Brewer signed it, citing "the crisis caused by illegal immigration and Arizona's porous border."\par \par \uc2 Fear drug violence\par \par \uc2 In signing 1070, Brewer also cited another concern - that drug- war violence in Mexico could cross the border into Arizona.\par \par \uc2 "We cannot delay while the destruction happening south of our international border creeps its way north," she said.\par \par \uc2 Incidents reinforcing that fear occur regularly. On Monday, gunmen in Tamaulipas, a Mexican state that borders Texas, shot to death the leading candidate for governor in today's Mexican elections. On Thursday morning, a shootout between suspected smuggling gangs killed 21 people south of the Arizona border, between the Sonoran towns of Saric and Tubutama.\par \par \uc2 In Arizona, crime related to smuggling has existed for decades. But the Krentz killing and incidents such as the April 30 shooting of Pinal County Deputy Puroll, allegedly by smugglers, reinforced the idea that things are getting worse.\par \par \uc2 Crime data, though, shows crime rates steady or down for Arizona's border towns and the state as a whole.\par \par \uc2 The number of "criminal aliens" admitted to Arizona's prisons is down in the fiscal year that ended June 30. The number peaked in fiscal 2009 at 3,436 and dropped last year to 2,743.\par \par \uc2 And the number of illegal immigrants estimated to be living in Arizona dropped from 560,000 in January 2008 to 460,000 in January 2009, the Department of Homeland Security estimates. The recession has likely pushed that population down more, said Passel of the Pew center.\par \par \uc2 Border security has been "a top-tier worry in Arizona for years," said Democratic pollster Lisa Grove. "What I think is new is heightened concern about border violence. As people are hearing about cartels, gangs, drug smugglers and human traffickers, the ante is up for voters."\par \par \uc2 The risk of violence crossing the border is real, said Fred Burton, vice president of intelligence for the Austin, Texas-based firm Stratfor Global Intelligence. But the data is lacking to say whether it's happening because, for example, a person who disappears in Texas may not be listed as a murder victim if his body turns up in Mexico.\par \par \uc2 Also, the cartels have reason not to challenge the stronger civil authorities in the United States, he said:\par \par \uc2 "They run the risk, if they come into the U.S. and assassinate the wrong person, of a more concerted law enforcement effort to go after them."\par \par \uc2 Key element of campaigns\par \par \uc2 Most candidates for Arizona governor and other offices have made border security a key component of their races.\par \par \uc2 On May 27, state Treasurer and would-be governor Dean Martin established a fund for donations from people concerned about border security. So far, it has $1,035. On June 8 he announced a border plan that includes a "tent city" for "illegal aliens convicted of crimes in Arizona."\par \par \uc2 For some voters, he said, "you can be right with them on everything, but if you're for amnesty, forget it. They're not going to support you."\par \par \uc2 Brewer has a border-security fund of her own - an account to pay for the legal defense of SB 1070 - with about $138,000 in contributions. The fund is a minor part of a major effort to show herself as tough on border security and illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 She has gone even beyond the bounds of the facts, saying in June that most illegal immigrants are smuggling drugs and implying that beheadings have occurred in Arizona.\par \par \uc2 And she has picked a fight with the president, accusing Obama of leaving Arizona unprotected. In an online video, Brewer stands next to a sign warning of smuggling activity in a spot 80 miles from the border.\par \par \uc2 "Washington says the border is as safe as it's ever been. Does this look safe to you?" she says, before addressing Obama directly: "Do your job! Protect our borders!"\par \par \uc2 As a Republican gubernatorial debate wound down on June 15, candidate Matt Jette wound up the other candidates by telling Brewer: "You act as if the state of Arizona is being terrorized by illegal immigrants."\par \par \uc2 "It is," candidate Buz Mills interjected.\par \par \uc2 "I have been to the border," Mills said. "The folks down there are living in fear and intimidation. They're terrorized down there."\par \par \uc2 In an interview last week, Mills acknowledged that border security isn't necessarily the most important issue facing Arizona, and he accused the governor of avoiding issues like the state budget and joblessness by talking about the border.\par \par \uc2 Brewer did not respond to a request for an interview.\par \par \uc2 Democrat Goddard has also staked out a position as tough on border crime and illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 "I've always had my hair on fire about this," he told the Arizona Daily Star editorial board. "The cartels are a security threat to the United States, and we've been fools to ignore it."\par \par \uc2 Contact reporter Tim Steller at tsteller@azstarnet.com\par \par \uc2 Measuring Arizona's border security\par \par \uc2 Measure 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009\par \par \uc2 Arizona apprehensions*: 577,517 510,623 416,231 326,059 248,624\par \par \uc2 Arizona-based Border Patrol agents**: 3,024 3,384 3692 3,965 4,170\par \par \uc2 Arizona marijuana seizures***: 884,204 879,523 1,264,095 1,132,323 1,655,265\par \par \uc2 Arizona \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  population****: 510,000 490,000 530,000 560,000 460,000\par \par \uc2 * U.S. Border Patrol, Yuma and Tucson sectors ** Sources: Yuma Sector, Star archives *** Source Arizona HIDTA.

Hayworth said at a community meeting held on March 31 in the unincorporated community of Apache, near where the Krentz family has worked its 35,000-acre ranch for 100 years.\par \par \uc2 Many, including Dever, believe the killing propelled into law an immigration-enforcement bill passed by the Legislature and signed by Gov. Jan Brewer that has thrust Arizona into the international spotlight.\par \par \uc2 "The fact that it got passed has a lot to do with the reflection and response to the Rob Krentz murder," Dever said from Washington, D.C., on April 20 after testifying before the U.S. Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\par \par \uc2 During testimony that day, Dever said Krentz "was senselessly gunned down on his own property" and that "his murderer was tracked to the Mexican border, and has since evaded capture," according to a copy of the testimony.\par \par \uc2 "We cannot sit by while our citizens are terrorized, robbed and murdered by ruthless and desperate people who enter our country illegally," Dever said.\par \par \uc2 Forty-eight hours after the killing, Dever told reporters that investigators believed the shooting was carried out by one person, but that they didn't know if it was a man or a woman, or the person's nationality. But Dever said they had reports that Krentz made reference to an "illegal alien" over a two-way radio he used to communicate with his brother while working that day on the southern part of their ranch.\par \par \uc2 "Given the location, (I) guarantee it was not somebody on their way to \uc2 Walmart\uc2  to go shopping," Dever said on March 29.\par \par \uc2 The Southeastern Arizona valley where Krentz was killed is a heavily trafficked people- and drug-smuggling corridor that has seen an increase in burglaries in recent years.

Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Law professors, others decode language in controversial law\par \par \uc2 The full impact of the state's new immigration enforcement law may not be clear for months - attorneys and law enforcement officials need to make sense of its language, and legal challenges will be settled in court.\par \par \uc2 But here are seven things we do know about SB 1070, which Gov. Jan Brewer signed into law April 23 and is scheduled to go into effect in mid-August:\par \par \uc2 1. It requires police officers to determine the immigration status of everybody they arrest before that person is released.\par \par \uc2 * The law says: "Any person who is arrested shall have the person's immigration status determined before the person is released. The person's immigration status shall be verified with the federal government pursuant to 8 United States code section 1373(c)."\par \par \uc2 * What that means: This could mean lots of extra work for local police officers, who have to make the initial determination and then contact federal agents for verification, said Raymond Michalowski, an Arizona regents professor of criminology at Northern Arizona University. The law does not spell out how the determination and verification must be done.\par \par \uc2 Police officers almost always get identification from people they arrest, but most police departments don't use that information to check everybody's immigration status, he said.\par \par \uc2 "This becomes a very large, unfunded mandate for police departments," Michalowski said.\par \par \uc2 2. During any stop, detention or arrest, a police officer must try to determine a person's immigration status if the officer has reason to suspect the person is here illegally. An exception exists if making that determination might obstruct an investigation.\par \par \uc2 * The law says: "For any lawful stop, detention or arrest made by a law enforcement official or a law enforcement agency of this state or a law enforcement official or a law enforcement agency of a county, city, town or other political subdivision of this state in the enforcement of any other law or ordinance of a county, city or town of this state where reasonable suspicion exists that the person is an alien and is unlawfully present in the United States, a reasonable attempt shall be made, when practicable, to determine the immigration status of the person, except if the determination may hinder or obstruct an investigation."\par \par \uc2 * What it means: The language - which was changed Thursday night to clarify lawful contact - effectively makes checking immigration status a "secondary enforcement" akin to the state's seat-belt laws, said Paul Senseman, the governor's spokesman.\par \par \uc2 The law doesn't force officers to go out looking for illegal immigrants, only to call immigration officials to determine the status when the officer develops a reasonable suspicion, Kris Kobach, a University of Missouri at Kansas City law professor who helped draft the bill, said in an interview with National Public Radio.\par \par \uc2 Kobach was Attorney General John Ashcroft's chief adviser on immigration law and border security from 2001 to 2003. He did not return phone calls from the Arizona Daily Star for this story.\par \par \uc2 He wrote in an op-ed for The New York Times that the law will most likely come into play after a traffic stop.\par \par \uc2 "A police officer pulls a minivan over for speeding. A dozen passengers are crammed in. None has identification. The highway is a known alien-smuggling corridor. The driver is acting evasively. Those factors combine to create reasonable suspicion that the occupants are not in the country legally," he wrote.\par \par \uc2 It's unclear if the law requires this determination to be made by a federal agent in person or over the phone.\par \par \uc2 The change in wording from "lawful contact" to "lawful stop, detention or arrest" would appear to exempt victims and witnesses from the law, but the statute still dictates a significant change in traditional priorities of law enforcement agencies, said Gabriel "Jack" Chin, of the University of Arizona's James E. Rogers College of Law. Chin has been reading statutes for 25 years and an article he co-wrote was mentioned five times in a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision, Padilla v. Kentucky, regarding the rights of illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 It will force officers to inquire about the immigration status of everyone they stop, detain or arrest, if there is a reasonable suspicion they are illegal immigrants, rather than focusing on determining the immigration status of people who have committed serious crimes or investigating more serious crimes, as they do now, Chin said.\par \par \uc2 "Police have to have priorities," Chin said. "They can't enforce every law against everybody. They have to decide what is most important and focus on that. Traditionally, they have focused on the most serious crimes."\par \par \uc2 The language also leaves much to the discretion of individual officers, which means it could be implemented quite differently by agencies and within agencies, regents professor Michalowski said.\par \par \uc2 And he's not sure the clarification in wording will help with the damage that might have already been done in terms of losing trust in immigrant communities that now fear any contact with police could lead to deportation.\par \par \uc2 "Once widespread fear has been created as it has in Latino communities in Arizona, a few minor word changes will not get the genie back into the bottle," Michalowski said.\par \par \uc2 Many law enforcement leaders have expressed concern that the law will discourage illegal immigrants from reporting crime to police for fear of deportation. That could diminish public safety for all residents if, for instance, a murderer or rapist is on the loose.\par \par \uc2 A Tucson police officer filed a lawsuit Thursday challenging the bill on this basis, claiming the legislation would hinder investigations in Latino neighborhoods.\par \par \uc2 3. People who officers suspect are here illegally must show one of four approved identification cards to prove they are in the county legally.\par \par \uc2 * The law says: "A person is presumed to not be an alien who is unlawfully present in the United States if the person provides to the law enforcement officer or agency any of the following:\par \par \uc2 * A valid Arizona driver license.\par \par \uc2 * A valid Arizona non-operating identification license.\par \par \uc2 * A valid tribal enrollment card or other form of tribal identification.\par \par \uc2 * If the entity requires proof of legal presence in the United States before issuance, any valid United States federal, state or local government issued identification."\par \par \uc2 What that means: If you are worried you might raise the suspicion of an officer because of your ethnicity or accent, it's best to carry your Arizona driver license or other documents that show you are here lawfully, immigrant advocates say.\par \par \uc2 Although a citizen or legal resident cannot be convicted under the new law, carrying proper ID will help to avoid having to go to jail while your immigration status is confirmed, Chin said.\par \par \uc2 But Kobach downplayed the need for anybody to carry identification in The New York Times op-ed.\par \par \uc2 "Arizona's law does not require anyone, alien or otherwise, to carry a driver's license," he wrote. "Rather, it gives any alien with a license a free pass if his immigration status is in doubt. Because Arizona allows only lawful residents to obtain licenses, an officer must presume that someone who produces one is legally in the country."\par \par \uc2 4. In a change made Thursday night by the bill's sponsors, the law prohibits police from using race to establish reasonable suspicion that someone is here illegally. The original bill prohibited using "solely" race.\par \par \uc2 * The law says: "A law enforcement official or agency of this state or a county, city, town or other political subdivision of this state may not consider race, color or national origin in implementing the requirements of this subsection except to the extent permitted by the United States or Arizona Constitution."\par \par \uc2 * What that means: The bill's sponsor, Rep. Russell Pearce, R- Mesa, said the original provision was relevant because 90 percent of people in the country illegally are from Mexico and Latin America. But after the change, he said the provision is probably unnecessary, as the U.S. Constitution already precludes racial profiling. What the change does, Pearce said, is remove a target for foes, both those in court and those criticizing the measure in speeches and demonstrations.\par \par \uc2 In The New York Times op-ed, Kobach wrote, "The Arizona law actually reduces the likelihood of race-based harassment by compelling police officers to contact the federal government as soon as is practicable when they suspect a person is an illegal alien, as opposed to letting them make arrests on their own assessment."\par \par \uc2 But Chin and Michalowski said the word alteration doesn't change the fact that this is a racial-profiling law. Michalowski said the removal of "solely" was a "public-relations" maneuver that likely won't change anything.\par \par \uc2 "With or without that one word the law increases the number of instances in which officers inclined to racially profile can do so," Michalowski said.\par \par \uc2 5. The law makes it a state crime to transport, conceal, harbor or shield illegal immigrants. There is an exception for child- protective-services workers, first responders, ambulance attendants and emergency medical technicians.\par \par \uc2 * The law says: "It is unlawful for a person who is in violation of a criminal offense to:\par \par \uc2 "1. Transport or move or attempt to transport or move an alien in this state, in furtherance of the illegal presence of the alien in the United States, in a means of transportation if the person knows or recklessly disregards the fact that the alien has come to, has entered or remains in the United States in violation of law.\par \par \uc2 "2. Conceal, harbor or shield or attempt to conceal, harbor or shield an alien from detection in any place in this state, including any building or any means of transportation, if the person knows or recklessly disregards the fact that the alien has come to, has entered or remains in the United States in violation of law.\par \par \uc2 "3. Encourage or induce an alien to come to or reside in this state if the person knows or recklessly disregards the fact that such coming to, entering or residing in this state is or will be in violation of law."\par \par \uc2 * What that means: The passage is borrowed from federal law and only applies to people who know or recklessly disregard the fact that the person is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , Kobach told The Arizona Republic.\par \par \uc2 But Michalowski said the law puts friends and family members of illegal immigrants in danger of violating the law when they are together. The law "makes citizens and legal residents criminals for providing aid to these family members and friends," he said.\par \par \uc2 "There is nothing in SB 1070 that says the law cannot be turned on them if they initiate contact with or are questioned by police in relationship to some other criminal matter," he said.\par \par \uc2 Those scenarios probably wouldn't put somebody at risk, Chin said, but he's not sure because of the inclusion of the exceptions.\par \par \uc2 6. The law makes it a state crime for illegal immigrants to work in Arizona.\par \par \uc2 * The law says: "It is unlawful for a person who is unlawfully present in the United States and who is an unauthorized alien to knowingly apply for work, solicit work in a public place or perform work as an employee or independent contractor in this state."\par \par \uc2 * What that means: This is the most clearly written part of the statute and what should be the headline of any story about the new law, Chin said.\par \par \uc2 This makes any \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who is working or trying to get work - for example, by showing up at popular gathering spots for day laborers - at risk of being arrested by an Arizona law enforcement officer. This is a big change, because previously, a non-citizen did not commit a state crime by working or seeking work, Chin said.\par \par \uc2 7. The law also makes it a state crime for somebody to stop on the street and pick up somebody for work, although it may be hard to prove - and because of the way the law is written this may still be OK as long as the driver pulls off the road first.\par \par \uc2 * Passage: "It is unlawful for an occupant of a motor vehicle that is stopped on a street, roadway or highway to attempt to hire or hire and pick up passengers for work at a different location if the motor vehicle blocks or impedes the normal movement of traffic. ... It is unlawful for a person to enter a motor vehicle that is stopped on a street, roadway or highway in order to be hired by an occupant of the motor vehicle and to be transported to work at a different location if the motor vehicle blocks or impedes the normal movement of traffic."\par \par \uc2 * What it means: This is an attempt to make it a state crime to hire day laborers, but the way it's written it may be hard to prove without getting a confession, Chin said. As written, it seems to only make it illegal to block traffic in the street, Chin said.\par \par \uc2 The confusion in this section is a theme throughout the law, Chin said.\par \par \uc2 "I have never read a statute that was attempting to regulate an area but left so many issues open and ambiguous," he said.\par \par \uc2 But Kobach dismisses the arguments against the law as misrepresentations and defends its usefulness.\par \par \uc2 "The Arizona law hardly creates a police state," he wrote in The New York Times op-ed. "It takes a measured, reasonable step to give Arizona police officers another tool when they come into contact with illegal aliens during their normal law enforcement duties."\par \par \uc2 Contact reporter Brady McCombs at bmccombs@azstarnet.com or 573- 4213.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 FUROR OVER AZ IMMIGRATION LAW\par \par \uc2 Immigration continued to dominate the political conversation Saturday at a rally with U.S. Rep. Raul Grijalva, in a town hall with U.S. Sen. John McCain - and in a Twitter posting from President Obama.\par \par \uc2 As many as 400 people - some carrying signs with slogans like "Deport the Arizona Legislature. They are the Real Danger to Our Community," and "This is what happens when we don't vote" - showed up at Grijalva's campaign headquarters on South Stone Avenue to protest Arizona's new immigration law, which authorizes police during any lawful contact to determine a person's legal status if reasonable suspicion exists.\par \par \uc2 Just as Republicans hope health-care reform will galvanize their voters for the November elections, opponents of the immigration law hope it will serve as a catalyst for their voters. Every speaker at the Grijalva rally implored the crowd to get organized and vote. And several applauded Grijalva's call for conventions to boycott Arizona.\par \par \uc2 The crowd cheered students who took to the streets for demonstrations. And they cheered when they heard the American Immigration Lawyers Association canceled its fall convention in Scottsdale, issuing a statement saying, "We cannot in good conscience spend association dollars in a state that dehumanizes the people we represent and fight for."\par \par \uc2 Richard Elias, chairman of the Board of Supervisors, echoed statements by a litany of speakers that the law will infringe on civil rights. "Yesterday, people of color lost their right to due process here in Arizona," he said, while City Council member Regina Romero called Friday "one of the darkest days in Arizona."\par \par \uc2 Brewer's signature came even as former Arizona governor and now Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said in interviews Friday "the border itself is more under control than it has ever been."\par \par \uc2 And the president, who has already said he will look into the civil rights implication of the law, sent out a "tweet" early Saturday afternoon saying the law "threatens to undermine basic notions of fairness that we cherish as Americans."\par \par \uc2 That's what worries 23-year-old Iliana Vargas, a research technician at the Grijalva rally. "It's racial profiling. There's no other way to look at it. I just see Arizona going backward."\par \par \uc2 And 21-year-old university student Jaimie Jackson said she wasn't mollified by Brewer's assurance of more officer training or of the law's language that legal status can be questioned only during a "lawful contact." "They can stop you for anything," she said, saying it's inconvenient for people to have to carry important registration documents at all times, even for quick trips to the mall or the grocery store.\par \par \uc2 Grijalva, a Democrat, said the economic boycott will be trivial compared with the money Arizona will lose in tourism and retail sales. And he called on Congress to "show the spine and the humanity to reform immigration laws," warning that otherwise, the new law will be a harbinger of things to come in other states.\par \par \uc2 He also continued his call for the U.S. government to refuse to cooperate. Since federal law has supremacy, he said, if the federal government refuses to detain or process the cases, then the new law is moot. He called for a "cleansing" at the state Legislature, which he said for too long has been tolerated as "silly extremists."\par \par \uc2 "Well, they're silly, but they're dangerous," he said, urging the crowd to continue nonviolent opposition.\par \par \uc2 Across town, about 80 people came to a McCain town hall where immigration also dominated the discussion.\par \par \uc2 Although McCain had sounded a note of support for the bill, calling it a "good tool" for law enforcement, he stopped short of fully endorsing the measure. "I haven't had a chance to look at all the aspects, but I do understand why the Legislature would act," he said. Even though it wasn't clear to him "whether all of it is legal or not," he said state lawmakers "acted out of frustration because the federal government didn't do its job."\par \par \uc2 He spoke of his 10-point plan to do that, including boosting border troops, paying them more, finishing the fence, improving communications equipment and giving more resources to local law enforcement.\par \par \uc2 Several in the crowd said they support the new law and expressed frustration about the lack of border enforcement.\par \par \uc2 Bob Foy, a 68-year-old retired lieutenant in the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, said holes in border enforcement are allowing the free flow of narcotics and weapons into the country. "We're in such imminent danger that we don't have another 100 years to get this straight," he said. The new law, while "not the perfect answer, is an answer," he said.\par \par \uc2 One woman said she lives near the Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge, which is being "trashed" by border crossers. Another said her daughter's boyfriend is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who has been in prison three times and keeps coming back.\par \par \uc2 One man chimed in that he was concerned about the mood, saying he was getting a vibe of animosity toward Mexican people in general.\par \par \uc2 McCain responded, "I am worried about anti-Hispanic feeling in this country, and I am concerned about condemning good, honest citizens of Hispanic origin because of this (immigration) problem." He noted Tucson was a Spanish-speaking city before it was English and he cherished the Latino heritage.\par \par \uc2 But pointing to the murder of rancher Robert Krentz, he said border problems need to be addressed not only for citizens here but for immigrants, who aren't protected under American laws and are preyed upon by criminal elements.\par \par \uc2 Pressed by one woman to call Grijalva's boycott irresponsible, McCain said he strongly disagrees with it, especially since the economy is hurting.\par \par \uc2 McCain, a Republican who has previously backed efforts to strengthen border security while creating a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants, has been speaking almost exclusively about border security this election season. The primary race pits him against former U.S. Congressman J.D. Hayworth, who is painting himself as the more conservative option.\par \par \uc2 McCain's border stance sits just fine with 60-year-old Patricia Patterson, a concierge. "I was on the fence about a few things, and then I saw him shift away from amnesty, and that brought me back to his side," she said.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, 29-year-old film student Omar Martinez said he's leaning toward McCain also. "I was crushed by the new law," he said. While he's fearful that people of Mexican descent like himself will be made scapegoats, particularly given deep economic frustrations, he said he was pleased with McCain's comments respecting his culture.\par \par \uc2 Contact reporter Rhonda Bodfield at 573-4243 or rbodfield@azstarnet.com\par \par \uc2 Document TUCS000020100512e64p00042\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 TUCSON/REGION\par {\*\bkmkstart toc44}{\*\bkmkend toc44}\b \uc2 Poll: Arizonans like immigration bill\b0\par\par\uc2 RHONDA BODFIELD   \par \uc2 RHONDA BODFIELD, ARIZONA DAILY STAR\par \uc2 584 \uc2 words\par \uc2 22 April 2010\par \uc2 The Arizona Daily Star\par \uc2 TUCS\par \uc2 FINAL\par A7\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2010 The Arizona Daily Star.

Jan Brewer has not said whether she'll sign SB 1070, although all three of her front line challengers say they support it. Businessman Buz Mills said, "For too long, we've waited for federal officials to do their job and secure the border," while state Treasurer Dean Martin said he supports giving law enforcement more tools to do their job.\par \par \uc2 Tucson attorney John Munger said he wants to secure the border using the Department of Public Safety and the National Guard. "We cannot keep waiting for the federal government to solve this problem for us, especially when we have the means and the authority to take action ourselves," he said.\par \par \uc2 On the other side of the political spectrum, the Border Action Network invited opponents to a mock funeral for the state Monday to mark its passage, saying the son of "responsibility and common good" had passed, but was survived by "hope, mercy and justice."\par \par \uc2 Democratic Attorney General Terry Goddard also is against it, as is U.S. Rep. Raul Grijalva, who is calling on businesses and national organizations to boycott Arizona as a destination. He noted a Super Bowl ban was effective in overturning the state's refusal to recognize Martin Luther King Jr. Day.\par \par \uc2 "Turning every police officer in the state into a roving immigration official, armed with a racial profiling mandate, is un- American on its face and cannot withstand even casual legal scrutiny," Grijalva said.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, Republican U.S. Sen. Jon Kyl expressed sarcastic disapproval of Grijalva's comments.\par \par \uc2 "That's very helpful. An Arizona congressman calling for folks to boycott his home state?" Kyl said in the Washington Times. "That'll really help job creation.

Mexican officials arrested Claudio Ramirez-Morales who was described as the Mexican- based manager of a smuggling organization.\par \par \uc2 The other 17 arrested were illegal immigrants agents encountered as they served search warrants in Phoenix and Tucson.\par \par \uc2 Thursday's busts were a major shift in how ICE and other federal agencies deal with illegal immigration, said John Morton, assistant secretary of Homeland Security for Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\par \par \uc2 "We are not seeking to prosecute a given smuggler, a given shuttle company, a given driver,'' he said. "We are seeking to take down an entire human-smuggling industry."\par \par \uc2 But while ICE championed the busts, many of Tucson's south-side residents and immigrant advocates questioned the show of force and hordes of media invited to watch.\par \par \uc2 "This is an intimidating tactic," said Carmen Sanchez, who lives nearby and came to watch. "This is putting fear into the Hispanic community."\par \par \uc2 Several arrested, vans seized\par \par \uc2 The raids brought traffic on South Sixth Avenue to a near standstill Thursday morning as immigration agents raided shuttle companies in front of a throng of cameras and reporters the agency had invited to watch, dozens of curious residents, immigrant advocates and Mexican Consulate officials looking on from across the street.\par \par \uc2 At Sahuaro Roadrunner Shuttle, 4207 S. Sixth Ave., two Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents escorted a handcuffed man from inside into an unmarked white Tahoe. They seized five vans from that location.\par \par \uc2 At the next door Sonora Shuttle, 4201 S. Sixth Ave., passengers from a van that had just arrived from Nogales were asked to get out of the van and agents checked the identifications of several. An ICE official said this particular van was not involved in the investigation.\par \par \uc2 Agents seized Andrew Provencio's shuttle, which he runs out of the Sahuaro Roadrunner location. Agents told him the shuttle was being used for people smuggling. But Provencio and his son, Ricardo Gomez, said they aren't involved in any smuggling. Gomez, who drives the shuttle to and from Nogales and was in the van at the time of the seizure, was questioned by ICE agents but was not arrested.\par \par \uc2 Provencio, who was visibly upset, said he bought the 2007 van last year and was just starting to pay off a loan on the $22,000 vehicle. Without making daily trips, he won't be able to make his $400 monthly payment.\par \par \uc2 "You are not even involved in what's going on and they seize everything," Provencio said. "We are clean. We are not that stupid to be bringing people."\par \par \uc2 Gomez said he and other shuttle drivers are prohibited from asking passengers about their immigration status. The owner of Sahuaro Shuttle, Vidal Ramirez, agreed.\par \par \uc2 "I don't have the right to ask for papers," Ramirez said. "I sell the ticket and that's it."\par \par \uc2 His company, which runs trips from Tucson to Douglas, Phoenix and Nogales, was not raided or visited by immigration agents. He said he wasn't scared when he saw the immigration agents but was alarmed at the size of the media and law enforcement presence.\par \par \uc2 "It's a big, big circus," Ramirez said.\par \par \uc2 He wasn't alone in his assessment of the raids.\par \par \uc2 Ushering the man out of Sahuaro Roadrunner in front of the cameras was a "disgusting perp walk," said Kat Rodriguez of Coalicion de Derechos Humanos.\par \par \uc2 "I hope they are ashamed of themselves," she said.\par \par \uc2 The massive show of force terrorized Tucson's south-side community and destroyed trust in the community, she said. She received calls all day from people worried about going to work or taking their children to school.\par \par \uc2 Border Action Network director Jennifer Allen said her organization supports action to curtail smugglers that exploit illegal immigrants but questioned the way the raids were conducted.\par \par \uc2 "It was such a heavy show of force," Allen said.\par \par \uc2 Rick Crocker, ICE deputy special agent in charge in Tucson, said Tucson police were there to provide officer and public safety. And he said that even though they were targeting the criminal leaders of the smuggling ring, they couldn't turn their back when they encountered illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 How it works\par \par \uc2 According to Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials, here how's the smuggling operation usually worked:\par \par \uc2 People were smuggled across the border and escorted to Tucson in private vehicles or in some cases, by waling around the checkpoint on Interstate 19.\par \par \uc2 In Tucson, they were passed off to shuttle companies "who are in cahoots with the smugglers," Morton said. They were housed at shuttle companies or drop houses.\par \par \uc2 Illegal immigrants would pay the shuttle companies a fee of $100 or more and be given fake fare receipts in the amount of $30 to make shuttle trips to Phoenix appear legitimate.\par \par \uc2 In Phoenix, they were taken to drop houses where other smuggling organizations took over, getting the illegal immigrants to their final destinations throughout the country.\par \par \uc2 Most of the smuggled illegal border crossers were from Mexico and Central America, but some came from as far away as China.\par \par \uc2 Those arrested are facing several federal violations, including money laundering, \uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2  smuggling and conspiracy. Those arrested in Arizona are expected to make their initial appearances in federal courts in Phoenix and Tucson today.\par \par \uc2 ICE seized about $10 million worth of assets, including more than 50 vehicles. During the arrests, agents found several weapons including an AK-47, Morton said.\par \par \uc2 The criminal heads of smuggling organizations are bad people, Crocker said.\par \par \uc2 "These are not good people. These are the people that hold them hostage," Crocker said. "The people that we arrested are not the people that come north looking for work."\par \par \uc2 Two months, ICE made a similar set of arrests of shuttle operators in the Houston area. More are likely, Morton said.\par \par \uc2 "The veil has been lifted over these shuttle companies,'' Morton said. "We're going to go after them wherever they are and we're going to expose them for what they are, and that is fronts for criminal networks.''\par \par \uc2 Contact reporter Brady McCombs at 573-4213 or bmccombs@azstarnet.com.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Aid groups had run afoul for placing jugs\par \par \uc2 Officials are asking for public input on a proposal to establish and maintain drinking water stations in the Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge to prevent migrant deaths in the rugged terrain southwest of Tucson.\par \par \uc2 The proposal signals a resolution to a standoff between refuge officials and humanitarian groups that have left gallon-jugs of water on \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  trails southeast of Arivaca.\par \par \uc2 "We tried to reach a happy medium," said refuge manager Michael Hawkes.\par \par \uc2 Refuge staffers and representatives from the aid organizations have been working together for months on ideas about positioning water stations in a way that causes the least impact to sensitive wildlife, said Gene Lefebvre, a retired minister and co-founder of No More Deaths.\par \par \uc2 Volunteers from No More Deaths, Samaritans and Humane Borders have received littering tickets in several instances over the past two years for putting out jugs on refuge land.\par \par \uc2 A prosecutor recently asked the court to dismiss charges against 13 people who had placed water jugs, Lefebvre said.\par \par \uc2 Hawkes, who has been critical of those placing the water jugs, said the U.S. government asked for the dismissal because the humanitarian groups made a good-faith effort to secure proper permits.\par \par \uc2 Since 2001, the refuge has issued a special-use permit to Humane Borders to maintain three water stations that consist of two 55- gallon drums. The draft assessment now under consideration looks at adding drinking water stations. The new stations would have containers tethered so they couldn't be removed by people traveling on foot.\par \par \uc2 "Drinking water stations would be strategically placed on or near existing trails," the draft assessment says. "Refuge management would ensure that water stations would not be placed in areas that may impact threatened or endangered species, sensitive habitat areas, or frequently used visitor areas such as designated camping sites and recreational trails."\par \par \uc2 Details about the locations of the water stations and the amount of water placed there are still being worked out, Lefebvre said. But the humanitarian groups have been pleased with the negotiations.\par \par \uc2 "It looks like it's going to be a workable plan," Lefebvre said.\par \par \uc2 The assessment concludes the additional water sites could both hurt and help the refuge. The stations could result in wildlife habitat loss and increased trash, and could alter migrant trails through the refuge. They could also affect visitors' experiences, the draft says.\par \par \uc2 While humanitarian groups say their goal is to reduce or eliminate \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  deaths in the refuge, the draft says no studies exist on whether providing water is an effective way to prevent deaths.\par \par \uc2 "If the numbers of deaths are not reduced by this activity, the need for permitting water stations on the refuge would be re- evaluated and could be reduced or eliminated," the draft says.\par \par \uc2 Still, Lefebvre was optimistic his group and refuge officials would be able to reach an effective compromise.\par \par \uc2 "We don't want to be in any kind of engagement with law enforcement," Lefebvre said.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Feeling spreads in ranch country after slaying of Robert Krentz\par \par \uc2 NEAR PORTAL - The hour- glass-shaped San Bernardino and San Simon valleys where rancher Robert Krentz was killed a week ago are nestled between the snow-capped Chiricahua Mountains to the west and the Peloncillo Mountains to the east.\par \par \uc2 It's a sparsely populated area on the eastern edge of Arizona along a 70-mile stretch from the U.S.-Mexico border to Interstate 10. There are a mix of longtime ranching families like the Krentzes, newer "40-acre ranchers," retirees and others who came for open space and solitude.\par \par \uc2 The smuggling of people and drugs across their backyards is something residents here have dealt with for decades. But, they say the killing of Krentz cements a disturbing evolution that began a few years ago - illegal border activity has gone from irritating to deadly dangerous.\par \par \uc2 "I've never felt more unsafe in my whole life," said Bill McDonald, a fifth-generation rancher who's property shares a fence with the 35,000-acre Krentz ranch. "I wonder if I want my kids and grandkids to live here. I've never had that feeling."\par \par \uc2 Cochise County Sheriff Larry Dever has called the killing a senseless act by a sick person. Investigators believe the killer fled into Mexico. However, investigators don't have a motive and don't know anything about the suspect, including whether the killer is Mexican or a U.S. citizen.\par \par \uc2 Sheriff's investigators attribute the spike in burglaries there over the past two years to illegal immigrants and smugglers.\par \par \uc2 The Krentz family said in a statement this week that Robert Krentz, 58, was killed by a suspected \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . Most residents here say they believe the killer was a Mexican drug smuggler.\par \par \uc2 "We are being invaded now by some nasty people who are perfectly willing to kill," said Chuck Osgood, 66. "These are not people coming for a better life."\par \par \uc2 Not all residents feel they are being invaded. But most agree they will be more cautious when they encounter smugglers and illegal border crossers. Craig McEwan, who moved to the area from Missouri six years ago, said he'll keep taking his frequent jogs and hikes through the Chiricahuas but says he feels more vulnerable.\par \par \uc2 Many blame the U.S. government for ignoring their warnings about the increased criminal activity and for failing to protect them. The Krentz family says it holds no malice toward Mexican people. They say political forces in U.S and Mexico are accountable for the death.\par \par \uc2 "Their disregard of our repeated pleas and warnings of impending violence towards our community fell on deaf ears shrouded in political correctness," the family statement says. "As a result, we have paid the ultimate price for their negligence."\par \par \uc2 Burglaries and break-ins\par \par \uc2 Like many families in the valleys, the Osgoods' home has been broken into. Sherri Osgood takes her gun with her even when she's putting laundry on a clothesline outside.\par \par \uc2 "We are afraid for our lives," Sherri Osgood said. "You don't know who's coming over the mountain."\par \par \uc2 In 2009, Cochise County deputies went to the area 53 times on calls about burglaries, property damage and suspicious activity. So far this year, they've gone 21 times, figures provided by department spokeswoman Carol Capas show. Some arrests have been made, but many crimes are unsolved. The sheriff's department didn't track such incidents by specific area before 2009, but Capas said there has clearly been an increase.\par \par \uc2 Some of the crimes in the area have been violent. On Jan. 20, suspects forced their way into the home and bound the older couple who lives there with duct tape. The intruders stole a bank card and the couple's 2004 Chevy Avalanche. Two men were arrested shortly after in Lordsburg, N.M. Capas said both were illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Most residents believe the robberies are being committed by drug smugglers heading back to Mexico. Unlike northbound groups of illegal border crossers who sometimes take food, water and clothes, smugglers covet valuables they can use or sell including guns, vehicles, binoculars and telescopes, residents say.\par \par \uc2 The extension of border fencing and vehicle barriers east of Douglas toward the New Mexico line by the Department of Homeland Security in the last three years has pushed smugglers farther east and through the valley, McDonald said. His family's 103-year-old ranch is located there, about 30 miles east of Douglas and five miles north of the border on Geronimo Trail. Trekking through the Pelocillo or Chiricahua Mountains doesn't deter drug runners, he said.\par \par \uc2 "These are extremely determined people with a strong profit incentive," said McDonald, who is executive director of the Malpai Borderlands Group, an organization of conservation-minded ranchers.\par \par \uc2 The spotty cell-phone service adds to the feeling of insecurity. Residents say it can take a long time for sheriff's deputies or Border Patrol agents to arrive.\par \par \uc2 The Cochise County Sheriff's Office has recently assigned all of its deputies working overtime hours under the Department of Homeland Security's Operation Stonegarden grant program to the area. And the Border Patrol opened a base in the area staffed around the clock.\par \par \uc2 Investigation\par \par \uc2 Friends and neighbors of Krentz can't fathom why anybody would want to kill a kind and compassionate man. "He's not a person who would instigate a violent confrontation," McDonald said.\par \par \uc2 Some wonder if a call made to the Border Patrol the day before by Phil Krentz, the victim's brother, about marijuana found on the property led to a retaliation killing. The Border Patrol says it recovered 290 pounds of marijuana on the ranch and arrested eight people nearby. But, they weren't able to prosecute them for lack of evidence.\par \par \uc2 Other residents, including a longtime friend, Nick Forsythe of Douglas, think Krentz was in the wrong place at the wrong time and came upon a person who simply wasn't going to let himself be apprehended. He doesn't buy the retaliation theory.\par \par \uc2 "Three-hundred pounds to these guys is nothing," Forsythe said of the seized pot load. "It's like you losing a pitching wedge at the golf course. It's not worth killing a rancher, because they know the huge repercussions."\par \par \uc2 Billy Darnell, a fourth-generation rancher and former Hidalgo County sheriff in New Mexico, said its important for investigators to keep an open mind about what have happened to Krentz. While it appears the shooter was likely a Mexican drug runner, that's not set in stone, said Darnell, who grew up near Apache.\par \par \uc2 "You don't want to put all your eggs in one basket," said Darnell, 66.

"There is going to be more bloodshed."\par \par \uc2 On Monday, in reaction to the killing, Gov. Jan Brewer reiterated a March 2009 request to send 250 additional National Guard soldiers to Arizona's border.\par \par \uc2 Rancher Dean Nelson said the National Guard should have already been called. "If the government doesn't call out the Guard, they don't care about us," Nelson said.\par \par \uc2 But Ashurst said the National Guard won't improve safety unless its personnel are given the green light to shoot at smugglers.\par \par \uc2 "They are going to have to kill some of those outlaws," Ashurst said. "I am going to protect myself and I will use deadly force. . . . I have a gun, and if an illegal alien ever gets in my house, he's dead."\par \par \uc2 The desire for a more aggressive stance at the border is shared by others in the area.\par \par \uc2 "Dig a ditch 20-feet deep and when they cross it, that's where they stay," said Hal Mortensen, a retired rancher and lifelong Cochise County resident who had known Krentz for 40 years.\par \par \uc2 Ranchers in the unincorporated community of Apache, about 25 miles northeast of Douglas, say they'll now be more vigilant when they encounter illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Ashurst, Nelson and Mortensen described Krentz as a good man who didn't have enemies.\par \par \uc2 Cochise County Sheriff Larry Dever called the incident a "senseless shooting." He said there is no evidence to suggest there was any confrontation.\par \par \uc2 "There is absolutely no reason this had to happen other than the bad intentions of one sick, sorry individual that we hope to be able to catch up to very quickly," Dever said.\par \par \uc2 The sheriff said he's worried angry ranchers may take matters into their own hands with smugglers.\par \par \uc2 "I'm angry as well, but the law is the law, and we have to act within certain constraints, and we'll encourage everybody else to do the same," Dever said.\par \par \uc2 Krentz, who was out checking water lines and fencing on his family's 35,000-acre ranch, had weapons with him on the ATV he was riding, but he did not use them, Dever said.\par \par \uc2 Investigators have determined the shooting was carried out by one person, but they don't know anything about the person.\par \par \uc2 They believe it was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  because Krentz was heard telling his brother on two-way radio "illegal alien" and because the area is a known smuggling corridor.\par \par \uc2 They have no motive.\par \par \uc2 Dever said Krentz was frustrated and fed up with the illegal activity like many ranchers in the area. But he said he was compassionate and regularly helped illegal immigrants in distress.\par \par \uc2 "There is no reason to believe anything else other than what happened that day with Rob," said Dever.\par \par \uc2 Krentz was found about 1,000 feet from where they believe the shooting occurred, dead on his ATV. The ATV still had its lights on and the engine running, Dever said. There were spin-out marks in the dirt, leading investigators to believe that he was trying to get away, Dever said.\par \par \uc2 Investigators believe the shooter was headed toward the border when Krentz encountered him. Law enforcement tracked a single set of footprints - believed to be the shooter's - for 20 miles to the U.S.- Mexico border. They also contacted Mexican authorities, but so far there is no information about the killer.\par \par \uc2 Dever said it will be very difficult to find the shooter and would likely require that the shooter talk about the incident with somebody.\par \par \uc2 While investigators don't have a motive yet, retaliation has been raised as a possibility, Dever said.\par \par \uc2 The day before the shooting, the victim's brother, Phil Krentz, reported drug smuggling on the ranch to the Border Patrol.\par \par \uc2 Agents found 290 pounds of marijuana on the ranch and followed tracks to where they found and arrested eight illegal immigrants, said Robert Boatright, deputy chief of the Border Patrol's Tucson Sector. None were prosecuted because of a lack of evidence. They were all in custody when the shooting occurred, he said.\par \par \uc2 Krentz regularly called the Border Patrol to let it know about illegal activity on the ranch, the agency said.\par \par \uc2 Dever also said there was another incident within 24 hours of the shooting that could be connected involving a gun, but he would not elaborate.\par \par \uc2 The area where the shooting occurred is a well-known drug- and people-smuggling corridor, Boatright said. In the summer of 2009, after seeing a spike in activity in the area, the agency opened a base staffed around the clock with 20 agents.\par \par \uc2 Dever said his deputies have responded to several calls from residents in the area about burglaries, property damage and even a few home invasions. Recently, the county had assigned all of the deputies working overtime hours under a Department of Homeland Security grant program to the area.\par \par \uc2 "There has been a prevailing sense for sometime in the community that something like this was going to happen," Dever said.\par \par \uc2 Krentz was a member of the board of directors of the Malpai Borderlands Group, an organization of conservation-minded ranchers.\par \par \uc2 Krentz's family had been ranching their property since 1907, and in 2008 the Krentz Ranch was inducted into the Arizona Farming and Ranching Hall of Fame.\par \par \uc2 "His impact on ranching in Southern Arizona can't be overstated nor can his contributions to Cochise County," said former state Sen. Jonathan Paton of Tucson. "Mr. Krentz's compassion and spirit will be remembered by many as we try to understand this senseless tragedy."\par \par \uc2 There is a community meeting planned for 6 p.m. Wednesday in the schoolhouse in Apache to discuss safety issues.\par \par \uc2 Star reporters Brian J.

She declined to comment on reports from neighbors and border activists that Krentz's death was related to smuggling in the area.\par \par \uc2 Area residents said Krentz had no enemies, and they could think of no motive for his death other than the possibility it was related to what they called the growing level of crime in the area related to illegal immigrants and drug smugglers.\par \par \uc2 Tom Tancredo, a former U.S. representative from Colorado, was visiting ranchers near Douglas to discuss border issues when he heard of Krentz's death.\par \par \uc2 Tancredo said he and Krentz were friends and that he was "a mild- mannered guy" who was known for providing illegal immigrants with food and water.\par \par \uc2 Tancredo and Chris Simcox, co-founder of the Minuteman Civil Defense Corps, said Krentz phoned a family member Saturday afternoon to say he was out near his watering hole, providing one or more illegal immigrants with aid.\par \par \uc2 That's the last his family heard from him, Simcox and Tancredo said.\par \par \uc2 "He looked the other way so often," Tancredo said. "It's so ironic that he, of all people, got murdered."\par \par \uc2 If Krentz's killing was caused by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  or a drug smuggler, U.S. Border Patrol spokesman Omar Candelaria said, it would be a first for the area, to his recollection.\par \par \uc2 "We haven't seen any instances of illegal immigrants or drug smugglers attacking U.S. citizens," Candelaria said.\par \par \uc2 Others who live nearby were unwilling to disclose their names when they spoke about the homicide Sunday because, they said, they were afraid of possible repercussions. A person at the Krentz home also declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 In a 1999 PBS interview, Robert Krentz and his wife, Susan, said illegal immigrants once stole property from their ranch, but that incident didn't stop him from aiding other trespassers.\par \par \uc2 "You know, we've personally been broke in once. And they took about $700 worth of stuff. And you know, if they come in and ask for water, I'll still give them water. I, you know, that's just my nature," Krentz was quoted as saying in written transcripts of the interview.\par \par \uc2 The longtime rancher's homicide already has caught U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords' attention.\par \par \uc2 Sometime this week, the Arizona Democrat will travel to Douglas for a briefing on the homicide, said Giffords' spokesman, C.J. Karamargin.\par \par \uc2 "Rob Krentz was a pillar of the Cochise County ranching community," Giffords said in a press release. "He will be greatly missed."\par \par \uc2 The Krentz family's cattle ranch was inducted into the Arizona Farming and Ranching Hall of Fame in 2008.

Para Jody Ipsen, es materia prima.\par \par \uc2 "Se me ocurrio que podiamos hacer algo con estas telas", explico Ipsen.\par \par \uc2 Ella penso en esta idea de volver a usar los materiales mientras estaba recogiendo basura en el desierto con la organizacion Fronteras Compasivas (Humane Borders) en el 2007.\par \par \uc2 El ano pasado, ella formo el grupo Los Desconocidos, un grupo sin fines de lucro dedicado a promover la conciencia sobre las muertes de las personas indocumentadas a lo largo de la frontera, creando y vendiendo bolsas hechas con los materiales que se recogen en el desierto. El nombre en ingles de dicho grupo es "The Unknowns".\par \par \uc2 Ispen por lo general lleva los articulos que ella encuentra a un lavado de carros para lavarlos a chorro de presion antes de lavarlos en una lavanderia. Despues le pasa los articulos a una costurera quien cose a mano las bolsas.\par \par \uc2 Una bolsa luce el bolsillo de un pantalon de mezclilla en un costado, adornada con lo que parece ser una blusa de mujer con flores rosas.\par \par \uc2 Las bolsas, a las que llaman bolsos de Sonora, estan hechas, casi en su totalidad, con materiales que se han encontrado, donde los inmigrantes sin documentos dejan tambien botellas de agua, cepillos de dientes y panales. Las bolsas cuestan entre 10 y 65 dolares. El dinero que se recauda se utiliza para apoyar economicamente otros proyectos.\par \par \uc2 Ipsen tambien esta planeando la produccion de una serie de colchas con objetos encontrados, cada una de estas dedicada a una seccion de la frontera por cada ano fiscal. Cada parche de la colcha llevara el nombre de un inmigrante indocumentado que haya muerto, o si no se conoce el nombre, simplemente dira "Desconocido".\par \par \uc2 La primera colcha, la cual es un tributo a las muertes de los indocumentados en el Sector Tucson de la Patrulla Fronteriza por el ano fiscal 2004, se termino en diciembre. Algunos parches estan decorados con corazones, otros con cruces o dibujos de sahuaros. Desde el ano 2000, los cuerpos de casi 4 mil inmigrantes sin documentos se han encontrado a lo largo de la frontera Mexico- Estados Unidos.\par \par \uc2 La Escuela Preparatoria Catolica San Miguel es una de las tres preparatorias que han adoptado las colchas. La semana pasada, la escuela recibio 208 parches, cada uno de cuatro por cuatro pulgadas, los que estudiantes adornaran, comento Alma Mejia-Garcia, maestra de espanol y coordinadora del programa de inmersion fronteriza de la escuela.\par \par \uc2 Ipsen esta tratando de incitar mas conciencia por medio de los eventos de la comunidad. Ella estara presente en la Feria de la Paz (Peace Fair) y el Festival de Musica en Reid Park el sabado con bolsas y carteras a la venta, tambien materiales para decorar parches.\par \par \uc2 Ipsen de igual manera proveera parches sin decoracion con un sobre con su nombre, domicilio y sello postal incluido para aquellos quienes quieran decorar un parche en su casa.\par \par \uc2 Ipsen, de 49 anos de edad, quien tambien trabaja como escritora independiente dijo que en un mundo ideal, sus esfuerzos no serian necesarios.\par \par \uc2 "Espero que algun dia no tengamos que hacer otra colcha mas", sostuvo. "Pero se que no sucedera".\par \par \uc2 Devlin Houser es estudiante de periodismo en University of Arizona que realiza sus practicas profesionales en el Star.

To Jody Ipsen, they are raw materials.\par \par \uc2 "It occurred to me that we could do something with this fabric," Ipsen said.\par \par \uc2 She got the idea to reuse the materials while picking up litter in the desert with Humane Borders in 2007.\par \par \uc2 That year, she formed Los Desconocidos, a nonprofit group dedicated to promoting awareness of immigrant deaths along the border by crafting and selling bags made from cloth materials collected in the desert. The name of the group means "The Unknowns."\par \par \uc2 Ipsen often takes the items she finds to a carwash to power spray them before washing them at a laundromat. She then passes the clean articles to seamstresses, who hand-sew the bags. One bag sports a jeans pocket on the side, accented with what looks to be the pink floral pattern of a woman's blouse.\par \par \uc2 The bags, called Sonora sacks, are made almost entirely of materials found at lay-up sites, where illegal immigrants also leave behind other items such as water bottles, tin cans, toothbrushes and diapers. The bags cost between $10 and $65. Proceeds are used to fund more projects.\par \par \uc2 Ipsen also is orchestrating the production of a series of quilts with her found materials, each one dedicated to one section of the border for each fiscal year. Each patch will have the name of an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who died, or if the name is unknown, simply "Desconocido."\par \par \uc2 The first quilt - which pays tribute to immigrant deaths in the Border Patrol's Tucson Sector for fiscal year 2004 - was finished in December. Some patches are decorated with hearts, others with crosses or drawings of saguaros. Since 2000, the bodies of nearly 4,000 illegal immigrants have been found along the U.S.-Mexico border.\par \par \uc2 San Miguel Catholic High School is one of three high schools that have adopted quilts.

When they reach a wash at the bottom of the hill, they set the jugs down in a bunch. On this cold and wet January day, Johnson, Ragan and Ayala Rahm leave 79 water jugs at six known \uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2  trails southeast of Arivaca.\par \par \uc2 These 1-gallon plastic jugs are at the root of an ongoing and sometimes antagonistic standoff between Southern Arizona humanitarian groups and Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge officials.\par \par \uc2 Refuge officials have issued littering tickets to 15 volunteers from No More Deaths, Samaritans and Humane Borders over the last two years for putting out jugs on refuge land. Two have been convicted in federal court and 13 are scheduled for trial in April.\par \par \uc2 In a refuge already considered one of the most imperiled in the country because of the damage done by illegal border crossers and Border Patrol agents chasing them, refuge manager Mike Hawkes says he'll allow members of the group to put out water only if they use 5- gallon or larger jugs chained to trees at set locations.\par \par \uc2 "It's an eyesore. It's garbage," said Hawkes, pointing to shattered jugs on the ground. "This is a national wildlife refuge. This is supposed to be a special place. They are putting out tens of thousands of bottles in the environment every year."\par \par \uc2 Humanitarians say the water jugs save lives in the desert, where more than 1,500 illegal crossers have been found dead over the last decade. As their posters say, members of No More Deaths believe humanitarian aid is never a crime.\par \par \uc2 Members are fundamentally against restrictions on their work, and say the littering charges are a smokescreen to keep water from those who need it.\par \par \uc2 "This is a public health emergency," said Margo Cowan, a volunteer and member of No More Deaths. "That would be like, 'You see a house on fire and you go get permission to assist whoever is in the burning house.' We just don't think that's the appropriate way to address the situation."\par \par \uc2 Debates about the merits of leaving water in the desert are nothing new in Arizona, but the level of acrimony in this dispute is.\par \par \uc2 Bad blood\par \par \uc2 The two sides have met three times in six months and exchanged several letters, but they haven't been able to reach an agreement.\par \par \uc2 Cowan, a member of the negotiating committee representing No More Deaths and Samaritans, is optimistic the issue will be resolved in time to avoid the April trial scheduled for the 13 people cited in July. The trial already has been pushed back twice.\par \par \uc2 "We are set on fixing this. It's got to get fixed," Cowan said. "We have no interest in being entangled in a legal context with the United States. We don't want to waste our time. Our only interest is saving lives and reducing suffering."\par \par \uc2 But Hawkes, who became refuge manager in September 2008 after spending six years at the Kauai National Wildlife Refuge Complex in Hawaii, isn't so sure.\par \par \uc2 "We are trying to work with them, but they have been less than cooperative," said Hawkes, who plans to retire at the end of the year. "I think they are intent on maintaining an adversarial relationship because of the PR they get from it."\par \par \uc2 The accusation is one of several scathing opinions Hawkes has about the humanitarian groups.\par \par \uc2 He calls No More Deaths an anti-government organization whose goal is to make sure every illegal border crosser has a safe and comfortable trip. Members want to leave water in the refuge - as opposed to other areas with more deaths - because the refuge is close and convenient from Tucson and Green Valley, he said.\par \par \uc2 Hawkes points out that only two bodies were found in the refuge in fiscal 2009.\par \par \uc2 He said the refuge is doing enough to keep illegal border crossers safe by coordinating with Border Patrol agents and with the placement of Border Patrol rescue beacons and Humane Borders water tanks. He also said there are plenty of water sources within the refuge, including cow tanks.\par \par \uc2 "That will save their life," Hawkes said. "It might make them sick. It might give them kidney failure or something later down the road. But it will save their life for the time being until they get to a road or something and get rescued."\par \par \uc2 Cowan and fellow negotiating team member Gene Lefebvre said the group is trying to avoid demonizing Hawkes, but they disagree with many of his claims.\par \par \uc2 There's not as much water in the refuge as he says, they maintain. Many of the wells he points out no longer work, they say, and the cow tanks are so dirty the water would make a person sick.\par \par \uc2 The bodies of seven border crossers have been found within the refuge since 2007, Hawkes said.\par \par \uc2 But hundreds have been found in the last decade in the Altar Valley, where the refuge is located, the Arizona Daily Star's border death database shows.\par \par \uc2 Last year was particularly deadly in the Border Patrol's Tucson Sector, which covers New Mexico to Yuma County. The bodies of 213 illegal border crossers were discovered in fiscal 2009, the third- deadliest year ever.\par \par \uc2 Cowan and Lefebvre call it disingenuous for Hawkes to cite litter as the reason for his opposition. Group members pick up trash during patrols and recycle jugs they find. The group offered to pick up twice the trash it leaves in exchange for being able to put out water, but Hawkes rejected the idea.\par \par \uc2 "If they really cared about the trash, they would snap at the idea of hundreds, perhaps even thousands of people, every year volunteering through No More Deaths to pick up trash," Cowan said.\par \par \uc2 Speaking on her own and not as a representative of No More Deaths, Cowan said: "Hawkes and his crew want to prevent water from getting into the hands of women and children and men crossing the desert. I think that's a personal view of his, and I don't think it's shared by the secretary. He's the secretary's problem. He's not our problem."\par \par \uc2 Department of Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, who met with No More Deaths representatives last summer, recognizes the urgent need to find a solution that will allow the group to continue its work while complying with federal laws, press secretary Kendra Barkoff said in an e-mail.\par \par \uc2 5-gallon jugs\par \par \uc2 When humanitarians meet later this month with Hawkes and refuge officials, the negotiations will likely turn to the size of the jugs.\par \par \uc2 Members of No More Deaths don't like the 5-gallon idea because they say most border crossers dump their jugs when empty, meaning they wouldn't have jugs to refill when they reach the water station, Cowan said. The group leaves out 1-gallon jugs so people can carry water north.\par \par \uc2 That's exactly Hawkes' concern: The No More Deaths jugs compound the jugs already left by illegal immigrants. He believes the 5- gallon solution would greatly reduce the trash.\par \par \uc2 That's why he rejected a permit application from humanitarians in October that asked to set out 1-gallon jugs.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, No More Deaths members say they'll keep leaving water in the refuge. Hawkes says they'll be ticketed if caught.\par \par \uc2 Contact reporter Brady McCombs at 573-4213 or bmccombs@azstarnet.com\par \par \uc2 On StarNet: Go online to azstarnet.com/news/ local/border for more border and immigration news.\par \par \uc2 Timeline\par \par \uc2 A look at humanitarian groups' standoff with officials at Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge.\par \par \uc2 * Summer 2007: No More Deaths and Samaritans begin leaving water in the refuge.\par \par \uc2 * Feb. 22, 2008: Dan Millis is cited for littering.\par \par \uc2 * September 2008: Mike Hawkes becomes refuge manager.\par \par \uc2 * Sept. 22 2008: Millis is convicted of littering but gets a suspended sentence.\par \par \uc2 * Dec. 4, 2008: Walt Staton is cited for littering.\par \par \uc2 * June 3, 2009: Staton is found guilty of knowingly littering in a national wildlife refuge.\par \par \uc2 * July 9, 2009: Upset that Hawkes doesn't agree to a meeting, volunteers from No More Deaths, Samaritans and Humane Borders protest by leaving water in the refuge.
