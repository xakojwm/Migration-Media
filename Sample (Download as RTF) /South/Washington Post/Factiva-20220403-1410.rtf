\par\par \uc2 right-turn\par {\*\bkmkstart toc0}{\*\bkmkend toc0}\b \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 's 'sanctuary city' nonsense ; Sanctuary cities are another Trump-concocted issue.\b0\par\par\uc2 By Jennifer Rubin \par \uc2 1,027 \uc2 words\par \uc2 9 December 2016\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Any reasoned debate on immigration quickly gets sidetracked into a morass of misinformation, phony statistics, alarmism and no-holds-barred bigotry from groups that seek to limit all immigration (not just illegal immigration). When it comes to "sanctuary cities," the discussion really goes through the looking glass. "In the immigration debate, sanctuary cities are unicorns, mermaids, and Bigfoot all wrapped into one,"\u160\'00\'A0Ruben Navarrette Jr. writes.\par \par \uc2 For one thing, "sanctuary city" is not a legal term, or even a precise term. Some people use "sanctuary city" to refer to municipalities that allow illegal immigrants unfettered access to government services. Others refer to the practice of not reporting individuals arrested for certain crimes to \uc2 Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)\uc2 . (Navarrette: "Some ordinances might bar local officers from cooperating with immigration agents at traffic stops. Others might bar federal authorities from ascertaining the immigration status of those booked. Others might prohibit the release to federal officials of any suspect who could be an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .") But to be clear, no state has the power to prevent an \uc2 ICE\uc2  agent from making an arrest, conducting an investigation or stopping a suspected \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . This is all about the degree to which \uc2 ICE\uc2  can dragoon local officials into doing the feds' work for them.\par \par \uc2 Trump suggests millions of dangerous illegal immigrants are being harbored by localities. He wants to cut off funding to these states, a draconian solution to an invented calamity.\par \par \uc2 Let's take a step back here. Conservatives should know that under the Constitution, federal authorities cannot force state officials to do the feds' work. That has been at the heart of challenges to the Medicaid provisions in Obamacare and other federal statutes that place conditions on money (e.g., expand Medicaid, raise the drunk driving age) going to the states.\par \par \uc2 In the context of Obamacare,\u160\'00\'A0Chief Justice \uc2 John G. Roberts Jr\uc2 . made clear that "our cases have recognized limits on Congress's power under the Spending Clause to secure state compliance with federal objectives. . . .\u160\'00\'A0Respecting this limitation is critical to ensuring that Spending Clause legislation does not undermine the status of the States as independent sovereigns in our federal system." The court therefore will strike down legislation that in essence "commandeers a State's legislative or administrative apparatus for federal purposes." He continued, "Congress may use its spending power to create incentives for States to act in accordance with federal policies. But when 'pressure turns into compulsion,' the legislation runs contrary to our system of federalism." Surely, threatening to take away all federal support for a city that doesn't send cops out on the streets looking for suspected illegal immigrants to round up for \uc2 ICE\uc2  would be unconstitutional.\par \par \uc2 So, to be clear, anti-immigrant advocates mislead by saying cities are giving "sanctuary" to illegal immigrants; they are complaining about the degree to which local law enforcement can be pressed into doing \uc2 ICE\uc2 's work, including the use of local jails to house illegal immigrants until they can be processed through the system. There is an irony here that Republicans who insist on federalism when it comes to a whole array of issues (e.g., environment, schools) now want the states to be agents of the federal government when it comes to illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Moreover, this is supposed to be about dangerous criminal supposedly unleashed on Americans. In fact, the number of illegal immigrants who have committed serious crimes and then been released into the community has been grossly exaggerated, as numerous fact checkers have pointed out.\u160\'00\'A0The Post\u160\'00\'A0has reported that under the Priority Enforcement Program, the country is currently doing pretty much what President-elect \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  wants, namely focusing on dangerous criminals. In conjunction with local authorities, \uc2 ICE\uc2  is trying to emphasize public safety. \u160\'00\'A0("Jennifer Elzea, an \uc2 ICE\uc2  spokeswoman, said the agency determines detention requests for immigrants 'on a case-by case basis\u160\'00\'A0with a priority for detention of serious criminal offenders and other individuals who pose a significant threat to public safety.' She added that \uc2 ICE\uc2  'is focused on smart, effective immigration enforcement that prioritizes the removal of criminal aliens, recent border crossers and egregious immigration law violators, such as those who have been previously removed from the United States.'") In fact, immigrant groups are complaining that the administration is casting\u160\'00\'A0 too wide \u160\'00\'A0a net, rounding up nonviolent drug offenders.\par \par \uc2 Trump has asserted there are 2 million to 3 million "criminal aliens" subject to removable.\u160\'00\'A0\u160\'00\'A0The Post\u160\'00\'A0and many other fact checkers have debunked this assertion. ("The number that directly fits the \uc2 ICE\uc2  definition of 'criminal aliens' released into the community is\u160\'00\'A082,228 \u8212\'20\'14 about 27 percent of Trump's figure [of\u160\'00\'A0\u160\'00\'A0300,000 criminal aliens released by \uc2 ICE\uc2  since 2013, who were not\u160\'00\'A0detained or processed for deportation ] \u8212\'20\'14 that the agency\u160\'00\'A0reported to Congress. Of that figure, 56 percent were released based on \uc2 ICE\uc2 's discretion, or 'being politically correct,' as Trump would say.")\par \par \uc2 In sum, the notion that the feds would force localities to become \uc2 ICE\uc2  agents and then hold for processing for indeterminate amounts of time every \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  they find is preposterous and unnecessary -- as well as constitutionally suspect. He's taken a problem of about 80,000, inflated it into an epidemic and highlighted a tiny number of isolated cases in an effort to frighten Americans and force states to become giant holding pens for nonviolent illegal immigrants. (There are plenty of constitutional issues about the excessive time people are being held while the immigration court backlog gets whittled down.)\par \par \uc2 Let's see what Trump actually comes up with, but simply tossing around the term "sanctuary cities," making up big numbers and threatening to end all federal funding for major cities should not obscure the constitutional and real problems associated with his scheme. Maybe like so much of what Trump said during the campaign, the issue will just fade away.\par \par \uc2 UPDATE: A colleague points out that Trump's promise to "cancel" funding for sanctuary cities in his first hundred days in office is even more ridiculous. Congress has the power of the purse.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020161208ecc8004pk\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 If you're still confused about why Democrats lost the election, look no further than the issues they prioritize. Instead of focusing on jobs, the economy and national security, the Democrats obsess over climate change, bathroom breaks and, curiously, sanctuary cities. Now is a good time for the Republicans to pick some fights, and the issue of sanctuary cities is a prime target. It's a perfect reminder of what Democrats have become. As my old boss Lee Atwater used to say, "Never kick a man when he is up." And right now, the Democrats are down, divided and in disarray.\par \par \uc2 The issue of sanctuary cities is one that is ripe for Republicans, if for no other reason than the Democrats' position is so indefensible. The very idea that city officials will blatantly disobey the law in furtherance of aiding foreign nationals who have entered city limits illegally is wrong on so many levels. Republicans should seize the opportunity to make the Democrats publicly defend their position.\par \par \uc2 Following \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 's election, liberals jumped to the defense of sanctuary cities, pledging to maintain sanctuary cities and protect illegal immigrants from the Trump administration.\u160\'00\'A0Mayor \uc2 Rahm Emanuel\uc2  said outright that Chicago will always be a sanctuary city, sending a message to anyone who was "very nervous and filled with anxiety" after Trump's win that "you are safe in Chicago, you are secure in Chicago, and you are supported in Chicago." There is always a lot of talk about what presidents are going to do on their first day in office. Well, I hope that on Sen. Jeff Sessions's (R-Ala.) first day in office as attorney general, he'll make his presence known with sanctuary-city officials who are flouting the law.\par \par \uc2 I applaud Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who has already issued an order cutting funding to sanctuary cities and who plans to follow that up with an outright ban on sanctuary cities in his state. But he needs reinforcement from the national Republican Party and from Washington, D.C. It's time to take the fight to the Democrats and others who want to push sanctuary cities in defiance of federal law. Hopefully, the Republicans will reintroduce Sen. Patrick J. Toomey's (R-Pa.) Stop Dangerous Sanctuary Cities\u160\'00\'A0bill, which withholds federal funding from those who refuse to cooperate with \uc2 Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2  officials, and Sen. Ted Cruz's (R-Tex.) Kate's Law, which also aims to coerce cities into cooperating with \uc2 ICE\uc2  and is named after Kate Steinle, who was murdered at random in sanctuary city San Francisco by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who had already been deported five times.\par \par \uc2 It's time for Republicans to challenge Democrats on this issue. As long as Trump is still tweeting too much, this is worth a tweet.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020161208ecc8006hd\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 the-fix\par {\*\bkmkstart toc2}{\*\bkmkend toc2}\b \uc2 Why \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  may not be able to close sanctuary cities \b0\par\par\uc2 By Amber Phillips \par \uc2 1,012 \uc2 words\par \uc2 2 December 2016\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 One of the most high-profile acts of defiance\u160\'00\'A0to a Donald Trump presidency so far has come from mayors of liberal cities \u8212\'20\'14Austin, Chicago, New York, Philadelphia, basically all of California \u8212\'20\'14 who have promised to create or uphold sanctuary cities for illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 "I like to compare this to conscientious objector status," Mayor Libby Schaaf of Oakland, Calif.,\u160\'00\'A0told the \uc2 New York Times\uc2  recently of her decision to defy mass deportation of immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Cities like Oakland\u160\'00\'A0could\u160\'00\'A0become one of the most visible thorns in the side of Trump, who got elected on a tough-on-immigration platform. In essence, these sanctuary cities are refusing to agree to\u160\'00\'A0hand over\u160\'00\'A0illegal immigrants to the federal government to be deported if they don't agree on why Trump's administration wants to deport them. (During the campaign Trump was adamant he'd deport\u160\'00\'A0all undocumented immigrants, though since getting elected he's backed off the mass deportation threat.)\par \par \uc2 Trump has indicated he has a zero-tolerance policy for these cities, even threatening to cut\u160\'00\'A0off\u160\'00\'A0their federal funding unless they\u160\'00\'A0agree to obey all deportation requests. That might be easier said than done.\u160\'00\'A0Immigration experts say Trump\u160\'00\'A0could run up against constitutional, geographic and even legal challenges in trying to force these cities to stop openly flouting him.\par \par \uc2 First, the geographic challenge. Trump could leave closing down these cities up to the states. Republicans do control a majority of state legislative chambers and governors' mansions.\u160\'00\'A0Texas state GOP lawmakers introduced a bill this week\u160\'00\'A0to cut off state funding to sanctuary cities,\u160\'00\'A0hoping to follow in the footsteps of\u160\'00\'A0North Carolina, which in 2015 became the first (and so far only) state\u160\'00\'A0to effectively ban them.\par \par \uc2 Yes. I'm going to sign a law that bans sanctuary cities. Also I've already issued an order cutting funding to sanctuary cities. #txlege {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://t.co/uYXa2QFrvE"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://t.co/uYXa2QFrvE}}}\par \par \uc2 But apart from North Carolina and Texas, immigration experts have a hard time seeing where else a ban might gain momentum. Most cities that let local law enforcement decide whether to hand immigrants to hand over to federal authorities for deportation \u160\'00\'A0are in Democratic-controlled states.\par \par \uc2 "A lot of the other Republican states don't have large cities or large number of immigrants, so it's just not an issue in a lot of these GOP-controlled states," said Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration policy analyst\u160\'00\'A0with the libertarian \uc2 Cato Institute\uc2 . (A bill in Texas failed in the past few years in part because\u160\'00\'A0there were no sanctuary cities to ban.)\par \par \uc2 Trump could just ask Congress to pass a law cutting off funding for\u160\'00\'A0sanctuary cities. Except sanctuary cities have never really been a priority for Republican congressional leadership, which seems much more focused on repealing Obamacare and tax reform (and, when it comes to immigration, securing the border).\par \par \uc2 Plus, Senate Democrats successfully blocked two sanctuary city bills in\u160\'00\'A0Congress\u160\'00\'A0in the past two years (including one immediately after 32-year-old Kate Steinle was shot and killed in San Francisco by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  deported five times prior).\par \par \uc2 At the time, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) derided a\u160\'00\'A0sanctuary city ban as "dog-whistle politics," pointing out crimes committed by illegal immigrants aren't any higher than crimes committed by any one else living in America. Senate Democrats gained two seats in November's election, so they should have the numbers to block a\u160\'00\'A0ban bill again.\par \par \uc2 If legislation isn't an option for Trump, some experts think taking the cities to court might be. \uc2 Jessica Vaughan\uc2 , the director of policy studies at the conservative-leaning Center for Immigration Studies, says the Trump administration could ask a federal judge\u160\'00\'A0for an injunction demanding these sanctuary cities hand over any immigrants the federal government wants to deport. They could argue it's technically against the law to shield immigrants from deportation.\par \par \uc2 But this, too, comes with risk. Challenging the legality of sanctuary cities has never been tried before, so it's a 50/50 shot on how the courts would read the intersecting and sometimes contradictory laws about state rights and immigration. (Some constitutional scholars argue a recent Supreme Court Obamacare ruling makes it unconstitutional for the federal government to be a "gun to the head" of state and local governments.)\par \par \uc2 The likeliest route available to Trump to close down sanctuary cities is probably the least effective. The Justice Department, under the leadership of anti-immigration Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), could limit law enforcement grants to non-sanctuary cities. Essentially, they'd be making it more expensive to be a sanctuary city, one grant at a time.\par \par \uc2 Of course, sanctuary cities could just decide sticking it to Trump is worth the cost. (Many cities have announced their intention to be sanctuary cities after Trump's threat to cut off funding to them.)\par \par \uc2 And you can't cut off funding for sanctuary cities willy-nilly, argues George Mason Law Professor Ilya Somin, because the Supreme Court has \u160\'00\'A0ruled you can't slap conditions on federal grants without explicitly telling states about the conditions.\par \par \uc2 Finally, all these options\u160\'00\'A0share something that's anathema to conservatives: They're big-government solutions. Getting rid of sanctuary cities requires\u160\'00\'A0a state, or Congress, or even the president to take a top-down approach and dictate\u160\'00\'A0municipal laws. And that can be an awkward thing for Republicans to\u160\'00\'A0gun for.\par \par \uc2 "The spectacle of the federal government trying to deport large numbers of people in the face of local resistance is unlikely to make good PR for the Trump administration," wrote Somin in The Post's Volokh Conspiracy blog.\par \par \uc2 Trump has options to try to tamp down on sanctuary cities, but all of them -- legislation, the courts, financial pressure -- are not guaranteed to work. And that means some\u160\'00\'A0of our biggest cities\u160\'00\'A0could openly flout one of Trump's most high-profile\u160\'00\'A0campaign promises, and there's not a lot he may be able to\u160\'00\'A0do about it.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020161201ecc10050r\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 President-elect \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 's Silicon Valley supporter \uc2 Peter Thiel\uc2  opined:\par \par \uc2 I think one thing that should be distinguished here is that the media is always taking Trump literally. It never takes him seriously, but it always takes him literally. \u8230\'20\'26 I think a lot of voters who vote for Trump take Trump seriously but not literally, so when they hear things like the Muslim comment or the wall comment, their question is not 'Are you going to build a wall like the Great Wall of China?' or, you know, 'How exactly are you going to enforce these tests?' What they hear is we're going to have a saner, more sensible immigration policy.\par \par \uc2 Let's unpack that and consider its implications going forward for the 45th president.\par \par \uc2 First, we don't buy it. Thiel and other Trump apologists choose to attribute a Chauncey Gardner-like wisdom to Trump. He's talking metaphorically, or aspirationally or something, they assured.\u160\'00\'A0Really, after years of hearing the right-wing disparage pols for lying to voters and not telling us what they wanted to do, we were supposed to intuit that Trump never meant what he said and the millions who voted for him knew he was not telling the truth? \u160\'00\'A0There is scant evidence Trump ever knew his assertions about the world were untrue. (Indeed, he often denied having said them.)\par \par \uc2 Second, a common definition of "literal" is "true\u160\'00\'A0to\u160\'00\'A0fact;\u160\'00\'A0not\u160\'00\'A0exaggerated;\u160\'00\'A0actual\u160\'00\'A0or\u160\'00\'A0factual." It's one thing to say I'm going to work 24 hours a day\u160\'00\'A0(figure of speech) or We'll make sure every \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who has committed a serious crime is deported (optimistic exaggeration) or We're going to change the way \uc2 NATO\uc2  operates\u160\'00\'A0(vague threat). It's another to make specific false assertions of fact (China is engaged in\u160\'00\'A0currency manipulation) and make a specific proposal (a\u160\'00\'A045 percent tariff).\par \par \uc2 Third, Trump, his supporters and flacks sound delusional or dishonest when they try to reinterpret or flat-out deny his previous statements. He never said he wanted to allow more allies to get nuclear weapons? He never exhibited racism or incited violence? When they say such patently absurd things, they make skeptics more skeptical and opponents more fearful that the incoming crew is out of touch with reality.\par \par \uc2 Fourth, the world takes what the president of the United States says both seriously and literally. Trump of all people should know this. He excoriated President Obama for laying down the "red line" when Obama could not back it up. His supporters lambasted the president for promising we could keep our doctors under Obamacare. Critics of the Iran deal cried foul when the president did not deliver on promises of anytime/anyplace inspections and assured us no "ransom" had been paid to Iran. Just imagine if Obama's defenders said we shouldn't have taken him literally on all these issues.\par \par \uc2 Fifth, international allies and enemies base their actions on the president's words. It's one thing for candidate Trump to say Ukraine is Europe's problem; if President Trump says it, Russian President \uc2 Vladimir Putin\uc2  may decide to move troops. When, for example, a candidate disparages a joint U.S.-Iraqi operation to recapture Mosul, the military and public may fret that he's undermining morale. When the president says it, military morale plummets, allied troops give up, and Islamic State leaders take heart.\par \par \uc2 Trump and far too many of his inner circles seem oblivious of the obligation of the leader of the free world to adhere to the facts as as the \uc2 U.S. government\uc2  can best determine them, to remain consistent in his public utterances, to grasp fully the consequences of the president's words and to preserve the credibility of the commander in chief. We can understand that Trump, someone entirely unqualified and largely ignorant about the world, never intended to win the presidency. Now, however, the reality show is over; there's just reality. The president-elect's team better put aside the word games, the spin, the temptation to gaslight the public and the inclination to indulge the Trumpian outrageousness. Their inability to do so will have alarming consequences.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020161114ecbe0053e\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Esta temporada electoral en los Estados Unidos dej\u243\'00\'F3 algo bastante claro: sin importar los resultados de las elecciones presidenciales, existe una proporci\u243\'00\'F3n importante de la ciudadan\u237\'00\'EDa estadounidense que desea una pol\u237\'00\'EDtica migratoria m\u225\'00\'E1s restrictiva. Esto puede implicar la imposici\u243\'00\'F3n de mayores restricciones para el ingreso de extranjeros, y posiblemente la deportaci\u243\'00\'F3n de indocumentados y delincuentes procedentes de Am\u233\'00\'E9rica Latina. Aunque los latinos hacen grandes aportes para hacer de los Estados Unidos el gran pa\u237\'00\'EDs que es, pecar\u237\'00\'EDa de sesgado si no reconociese que algunos inmigrantes latinos muestran un menor respeto por la legislaci\u243\'00\'F3n y la sociedad estadounidense, ya sea involucr\u225\'00\'E1ndose en actividades criminales, abusando del sistema de seguridad social, etc.\par \par \uc2 Estados Unidos, como una naci\u243\'00\'F3n soberana, est\u225\'00\'E1 en todo su derecho de castigar a aquellos inmigrantes que violan sus leyes de acuerdo con la legislaci\u243\'00\'F3n existente, y de generar nueva legislaci\u243\'00\'F3n migratoria de acuerdo con los intereses de sus ciudadanos. Como un salvadore\u241\'00\'F1o que ni siquiera habita en los Estados Unidos, no me encuentro en posici\u243\'00\'F3n de requerir una pol\u237\'00\'EDtica de fronteras abiertas, ni de expresar alg\u250\'00\'FAn tipo de queja si criminales procedentes de mi pa\u237\'00\'EDs son deportados. Sin embargo, existe un tema que me preocupa profundamente, y me siento obligado a llamar la atenci\u243\'00\'F3n acerca de ello. Me preocupa que EEUU lleve a cabo un cambio dr\u225\'00\'E1stico en su pol\u237\'00\'EDtica migratoria sin tomar en cuenta las consecuencias para sus vecinos en el Sur, particularmente en la regi\u243\'00\'F3n conocida como "el tri\u225\'00\'E1ngulo del norte" (Guatemala, El Salvador y Honduras), caracterizada por d\u233\'00\'E9biles instituciones democr\u225\'00\'E1ticas y altos \u237\'00\'EDndices de violencia.\par \par \uc2 Dicha regi\u243\'00\'F3n se encuentra gravemente afectada por la actividad de pandillas, las cuales han causado importantes da\u241\'00\'F1os a nuestra sociedad. Dos de las pandillas m\u225\'00\'E1s activas en el \u225\'00\'E1rea nacieron, de hecho, en los Estados Unidos, entre inmigrantes latinos, muchos de quienes llegaron huyendo de las guerras civiles en sus respectivos pa\u237\'00\'EDses. Estas pandillas llegaron a la regi\u243\'00\'F3n centroamericana en gran parte debido a las deportaciones de la d\u233\'00\'E9cada de los noventas, aceleradas por la \uc2 Illegal Immigrant\uc2  Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) de 1996 (durante el gobierno de Clinton). Las j\u243\'00\'F3venes instituciones en nuestros pa\u237\'00\'EDses, apenas recuper\u225\'00\'E1ndose de los conflictos de los 90s, fueron incapaces de lidiar con este repentino flujo de inmigrantes con antecedentes penales y pandilleriles, llevando a la crisis de seguridad que tenemos ahora.\par \par \uc2 No es mi intenci\u243\'00\'F3n el culpar a los Estados Unidos de la actual crisis institucional en mi pa\u237\'00\'EDs (mis pol\u237\'00\'EDticos tienen mucho que ver con eso), simplemente deseo hacer ver que una crisis institucional causada por una pol\u237\'00\'EDtica migratoria bipolar puede causar un da\u241\'00\'F1o considerable a las ya d\u233\'00\'E9biles instituciones del continente, y definitivamente no es la \u250\'00\'FAnica ni la mejor soluci\u243\'00\'F3n al problema migratorio de los Estados Unidos. \u191\'00\'BFPor qu\u233\'00\'E9 tiene que importarle esto a los ciudadanos americanos? Adem\u225\'00\'E1s de los obvios beneficios de mantener las buenas relaciones entre los pa\u237\'00\'EDses del contiente, considero que est\u225\'00\'E1 en los mejores intereses de los Estados Unidos el contar con vecinos con instituciones saludables en una \u233\'00\'E9poca cuando los enemigos de Am\u233\'00\'E9rica est\u225\'00\'E1n a la b\u250\'00\'FAsqueda del eslab\u243\'00\'F3n m\u225\'00\'E1s d\u233\'00\'E9bil. Con una actitud abierta al di\u225\'00\'E1logo, los pa\u237\'00\'EDses de Am\u233\'00\'E9rica Latina son capaces de participar en la b\u250\'00\'FAsqueda de soluciones que beneficien a los Estados Unidos, sin causar da\u241\'00\'F1os innecesarios a las ya debilitadas democracias del Sur.\par \par \uc2 \u173\'00\'AD\u173\'00\'AD\u173\'00\'AD\u173\'00\'AD\u8212\'20\'14\u8212\'20\'14\u8212\'20\'14\u8212\'20\'14\u8212\'20\'14\u8212\'20\'14\u8212\'20\'14\u8212\'20\'14\u8212\'20\'14\u8212\'20\'14\u8212\'20\'14\par \par \uc2 Mart\u237\'00\'EDnez es salvadore\u241\'00\'F1o y Estudiante del Programa de Doctorado en Econom\u237\'00\'EDa de la Universidad Keio.

What happens if and when he doesn't deliver?\b0\par\par\uc2 By Aaron Blake \par \uc2 866 \uc2 words\par \uc2 10 November 2016\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  will either be the most successful president of all time, or he will break more promises\u160\'00\'A0than any presidential candidate ever.\par \par \uc2 One of the many quirks of Trump's campaign was that he promised voters the world. And it wasn't subtle or couched; he was going to get it all done. In fact, he literally\u160\'00\'A0promised "to make possible every dream you've ever dreamed." He repeated that pledge on Monday.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2 's Sean Sullivan and Dana Priest have a good, thorough piece today running through the practicality of many of his biggest legislative and executive goals\u160\'00\'A0\u8212\'20\'14\u160\'00\'A0including repealing the Affordable Care Act, undoing President Obama's immigration executive actions, building a border wall, renegotiating free trade deals like the \uc2 North American Free Trade Agreement\uc2  and instituting the largest tax cut since Ronald Reagan (while, at the same time, ballooning things such as infrastructure spending).\par \par \uc2 But many of his promises were much bigger and more abstract than that. They were aspirational.\u160\'00\'A0They were things Trump would do by force of will and/or with his superior negotiating strength. For instance:\par \par \uc2 * He said he would have a "100 percent chance" of getting rid of the Islamic State \u8212\'20\'14 that his plan was "foolproof."\par \par \uc2 * He promised dozens of times to somehow make Mexico pay for the border wall.\par \par \uc2 * He has said that "the crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soon \u8212\'20\'14 and I mean very soon \u8212\'20\'14 come to an end."\par \par \uc2 * He has promised, in varying ways, to deport hundreds of thousands of criminal illegal immigrants almost instantly. He has also said that no Americans will be victimized by \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  crime when he's president.\par \par \uc2 * He promised to "be the greatest jobs president that God ever created," repeatedly.\par \par \uc2 Trump's odds of accomplishing his legislative goals have certainly been improved by the GOP holding both the House and the Senate. That will make doing things like repealing the Affordable Care Act much easier. But the things above are much more complicated than passing laws. They involve many things that are outside a president's control, and they would be exceedingly difficult for even a great president to accomplish.\par \par \uc2 The question from there is whether he'll be judged accordingly \u8212\'20\'14 especially by\u160\'00\'A0his most ardent supporters.\par \par \uc2 One of the other quirks of Trump's campaign was that, while the media took most everything he said at face value, many of his supporters didn't seem to. They seemed to like the way he was talking and thinking big, even if they didn't think he necessarily meant much of it.\par \par \uc2 The wall is a telling example of how supporters interpreted Trump's promises. While polling showed 66 percent of Trump supporters thought he would succeed in building the wall, another poll showed just 48 percent thought he could actually get Mexico to pay for it.\par \par \uc2 And still another poll showed only 18\u160\'00\'A0percent of Trump supporters thought it "very likely" that he would succeed on that count. And yet, they cheered.\par \par \uc2 So do Trump supporters really think he will end crime and violence? Do they really think criminal illegal immigrants will instantly be gone? Do they really expect his jobs record to be unprecedented? Perhaps not literally.\par \par \uc2 But there are things Trump promised that the base will likely expect him to deliver on. Chief among them is repealing the Affordable Care Act, certainly, but also renegotiating trade agreements and possibly even putting \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  in jail (or at least appointing a special prosecutor). That last one seems a particularly unlikely way for Trump to actually begin his presidency, but if he doesn't follow through, he risks alienating tens of millions of people who loved it as a rallying cry.\par \par \uc2 Similarly, if the Islamic State and terrorism continue to loom as a threat \u8212\'20\'14 or even, God forbid, succeed in striking the United States \u8212\'20\'14 that would be a major broken promise that would be very real to Americans who believed (or even just hoped) Trump would end the threat.\par \par \uc2 Broken promises, of course, are the domain of pretty much any presidency. Obama has certainly broken some high-profile ones, including closing the Guantanamo Bay detention center in Cuba and ending the Iraq and Afghanistan wars quickly. He also previously pledged not to put boots on the ground in the battle to fight the Islamic State, and now he has \u8212\'20\'14 albeit not "combat troops." PolitiFact has tracked more than 500 Obama promises and found that he has broken 22 percent of them and only completely kept 45 percent.\par \par \uc2 But Trump's promises far outstrip anything that basically any other serious presidential candidate has ever promised. His braggadocio demanded that he make big promises about being the best\u160\'00\'A0at everything and making everyone's dreams come true.\par \par \uc2 At the time, to be honest, we all thought that he would lose and that he would never be put in the position of actually delivering on them. But now it's time to see if he can cash the checks his mouth has written.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020161110ecba004h6\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 When Myron Haughton was picked up by authorities, he was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  with three felony convictions. Yet the Maryland resident convinced an immigration judge last year that he was a changed man, a husband and father who should be granted permanent residency, not be deported.\par \par \uc2 So why is he still behind bars?\par \par \uc2 That question places\u173\'00\'AD Haughton, of Silver Spring, in the thick of a debate playing out in courts across the country. He and more than 1,000 other immigrants in similar circum\u173\'00\'ADstances say they should have a chance to return to their homes and families while fighting deportation.\par \par \uc2 The government \u8212\'20\'14 which is appealing the immigration judge's ruling in Haughton's case \u8212\'20\'14 firmly disagrees that he or any of the others deserves a bond hearing.\par \par \uc2 Recently, a U.S. district judge in Virginia sided with Haughton, 29, saying that his detention, already lasting more than a year, had become unreasonable and that he deserved a bond hearing. Although she was the first judge in Virginia to take that position in such a case, six of the nation's federal appeals courts have \u173\'00\'ADissued similar rulings.\par \par \uc2 The broader controversy could be resolved this term by the Supreme Court, which is scheduled to consider the case of California inmates contesting prolonged detention in such instances. A decision, assuming the high court can put together a majority, is eagerly awaited.\par \par \uc2 According to \uc2 the American Civil Liberties Union\uc2 , the cases\u173\'00\'AD of about 4,500 detainees nationwide have been pending for more than six months. The \uc2 ACLU\uc2  estimates that 5,000 to 10,000 immigrants are being held because of criminal histories. Many of them, like Haughton, face consequences that they and their supporters consider disproportionate to their transgressions.\par \par \uc2 "Myron Haughton is as American as any other American," his attorney, Alfred Robertson, said. "He deserves to be with his family. Although he's made mistakes in the past, he's already paid for those mistakes."\par \par \uc2 Haughton's childhood was marked by trauma. He was abused by his stepmother in Jamaica, according to court records, and by his mother after he came to Maryland, illegally, at the age of 11. When a teacher noticed his bruises, he was sent to live with an aunt. But two years later, the aunt returned him to his mother, and the abuse resumed.\par \par \uc2 At 16, Haughton ran away from home and began living on the streets of Silver Spring with a group of petty criminals who broke into cars and unoccupied homes. Haughton was arrested after a break-in committed soon after his 18th birthday. He briefly escaped juvenile detention by stealing a teacher's car keys and driving through a fence; then he pleaded guilty in 2006 to burglary and theft.\par \par \uc2 Haughton served 18 months of a five-year prison sentence and then was released on probation. He soon met Tatiana Barrow. She was raised in a Russian orphanage after being removed from her parents' home because of neglect, and she was adopted by U.S. citizens at age 15.\par \par \uc2 Barrow and Haughton have two children \u8212\'20\'14 Adelina and Ayden, now 6 and 4. Haughton took care of the children and worked odd jobs, limited by his lack of legal status. Court records show that he received traffic tickets over the years for driving without a valid license.\par \par \uc2 It was one such incident that sparked his current troubles. In December 2013, he was arrested in Virginia's Prince William County and charged with driving without a valid license. When \uc2 Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) \uc2 learned that he was in the country illegally, he was transferred to federal custody and slated for deportation.\par \par \uc2 Haughton was detained in the Arlington County jail until September 2014 as immigration officials struggled to put together the documents they needed to send him back to Jamaica. During that time, Barrow and Haughton were married. He was released under supervision for a year, until the paperwork was in order, and then he was taken back into custody in rural Farmville, Va. From jail, he applied for permanent residency through his wife, a U.S. citizen.\par \par \uc2 Barrow told an immigration court that because of the cost of day care, she had been living "paycheck to paycheck" since her husband's incarceration and had fallen months behind on her rent. She also said the separation caused the family emotional strain.\par \par \uc2 "Because we grew up \u8212\'20\'14 he grew up with abuse, I grew up in an orphanage \u8212\'20\'14 .\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09. we don't want this for our kids," she told the court.\par \par \uc2 In May, an immigration judge agreed that separating the family would cause "exceptional and extremely unusual hardship" and granted Haughton permanent residency. The government appealed the decision. Haughton remained in custody but has asked a federal court for a bond hearing.\par \par \uc2 The Supreme Court ruled in 2003 that mandatory detention of noncitizens with certain criminal records is constitutional for "the brief period necessary for their removal proceedings." At issue now is whether the many months that immigrants are spending in detention centers meet that standard.\par \par \uc2 The government argues that Congress chose to make detention mandatory and that delays caused by a detainee's appeals should not be used to justify the detainee's release.\par \par \uc2 "It is a statistical certainty .\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09. that some of those criminal aliens will abscond and that some will commit further crimes that detention would have prevented," Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr. wrote in his brief to the Supreme Court.\par \par \uc2 A study by \uc2 Syracuse University\uc2  found that 14\u160\'00\'A0percent of immigration detainees released on bond failed to return to court during fiscal 2015.\par \par \uc2 Advocates argue that the cases\u173\'00\'AD that last the longest are those in which the immigrant in question has the best chance of winning permanent residency \u8212\'20\'14 and thus is probably least deserving of indefinite detention.\par \par \uc2 "A large percentage are lawful green-card holders who committed a crime that \uc2 ICE\uc2  thinks might make them deportable," said C\u233\'00\'E9sar Cuauht\u233\'00\'E9moc Garc\u237\'00\'EDa Hern\u225\'00\'E1ndez, a professor at the University of Denver's Sturm College of Law. "These are people who are fully incorporated into U.S. society. .\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09. It's hard to justify treating them differently because they're not citizens."\par \par \uc2 Haughton is not a green-card holder, and the government contends that his detention is not extraordinary or unwarranted. His continuing imprisonment is attributable to his own "belated decision to seek an adjustment of status," prosecutors argued in one court filing. \uc2 ICE\uc2  "vigorously disputes" the decision to grant him permanent residency, Assistant U.S. Attorney Lauren Wetzler wrote.\par \par \uc2 Yet U.S. District Judge Leonie M. Brinkema found that Haughton deserved a bond hearing, using a multi-part test as four federal appeals courts have done in similar cases. Advocates would rather see the Supreme Court adopt a standard applied by two other appellate courts and require bond hearings for all detainees after six months. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th\u160\'00\'A0Circuit, which includes Maryland and Virginia, is not one of those six appeals courts.\par \par \uc2 "It really is night and day with the kind of remedy and the kind of system you end up with," said Michael Tan, an immigration lawyer with the \uc2 ACLU\uc2 . In California, where the six-month rule applies, he said thousands have received hearings. In Delaware, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, where there is no firm time limit, only about two dozen immigrants have.\par \par \uc2 The Supreme Court could embrace one of the standards applied by the federal appeals courts, set yet another standard or rule that bond hearings are not required at all.\par \par \uc2 The justices could also decide whether the burden of proof in such a hearing would fall on the government or on the detainee, an issue that has divided lower courts. Prosecutors in Virginia are fighting Brinkema's decision to force the government to prove that Haughton is a flight risk or a danger.\par \par \uc2 Another question is what the court will make of the government's admission that the statistics it relied on in 2003 were wrong. The solicitor general had said that appealed cases take an average of 233 days to complete, or a little less than eight months. In fact, the office acknowledged in August that, on average, cases took 382 days, or more than a year.\par \par \uc2 In 2015, according to the Justice Department, the average case took 313 days, but that does not include the time a person spent in detention before filing or any post-decision court action.\par \par \uc2 Haughton is scheduled to get his bond hearing before an immigration judge on Wednesday, after 395 days in detention.\par \par \uc2 rachel.weiner@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020161028ecar002s2\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved \par \par \uc2 When Myron Haughton was picked up by authorities, he was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  with three felony convictions. Yet the Maryland resident convinced an immigration judge last year that he was a changed man, a husband and father who should be granted permanent residency, not be deported.\par \par \uc2 So why is he still behind bars?\par \par \uc2 That question places Haughton, of Silver Spring, in the thick of a debate playing out in courts across the country. He and more than 1,000 other immigrants in similar circumstances say they should have a chance to return to their homes and families while fighting deportation.\par \par \uc2 The government - which is appealing the immigration judge's ruling in Haughton's case - firmly disagrees that he or any of the others deserves a bond hearing.\par \par \uc2 Recently, a U.S. district judge in Virginia sided with Haughton, 29, saying that his detention, already lasting more than a year, had become unreasonable and that he deserved a bond hearing. Although she was the first judge in Virginia to take that position in such a case, six of the nation's federal appeals courts have issued similar rulings.\par \par \uc2 The broader controversy could be resolved this term by the Supreme Court, which is scheduled to consider the case of California inmates contesting prolonged detention in such instances. A decision, assuming the high court can put together a majority, is eagerly awaited.\par \par \uc2 According to \uc2 the American Civil Liberties Union\uc2 , the cases of about 4,500 detainees nationwide have been pending for more than six months. The \uc2 ACLU\uc2  estimates that 5,000 to 10,000 immigrants are being held because of criminal histories. Many of them, like Haughton, face consequences that they and their supporters consider disproportionate to their transgressions.\par \par \uc2 "Myron Haughton is as American as any other American," his attorney, Alfred Robertson, said. "He deserves to be with his family. Although he's made mistakes in the past, he's already paid for those mistakes."\par \par \uc2 Haughton's childhood was marked by trauma. He was abused by his stepmother in Jamaica, according to court records, and by his mother after he came to Maryland, illegally, at the age of 11. When a teacher noticed his bruises, he was sent to live with an aunt. But two years later, the aunt returned him to his mother, and the abuse resumed.\par \par \uc2 At 16, Haughton ran away from home and began living on the streets of Silver Spring with a group of petty criminals who broke into cars and unoccupied homes. Haughton was arrested after a break-in committed soon after his 18th birthday. He briefly escaped juvenile detention by stealing a teacher's car keys and driving through a fence; then he pleaded guilty in 2006 to burglary and theft.\par \par \uc2 Haughton served 18 months of a five-year prison sentence and then was released on probation. He soon met Tatiana Barrow. She was raised in a Russian orphanage after being removed from her parents' home because of neglect, and she was adopted by U.S. citizens at age 15.\par \par \uc2 Barrow and Haughton have two children - Adelina and Ayden, now 6 and 4. Haughton took care of the children and worked odd jobs, limited by his lack of legal status. Court records show that he received traffic tickets over the years for driving without a valid license.\par \par \uc2 It was one such incident that sparked his current troubles. In December 2013, he was arrested in Virginia's Prince William County and charged with driving without a valid license. When \uc2 Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) \uc2 learned that he was in the country illegally, he was transferred to federal custody and slated for deportation.\par \par \uc2 Haughton was detained in the Arlington County jail until September 2014 as immigration officials struggled to put together the documents they needed to send him back to Jamaica. During that time, Barrow and Haughton were married. He was released under supervision for a year, until the paperwork was in order, and then he was taken back into custody in rural Farmville, Va. From jail, he applied for permanent residency through his wife, a U.S. citizen.\par \par \uc2 Barrow told an immigration court that because of the cost of day care, she had been living "paycheck to paycheck" since her husband's incarceration and had fallen months behind on her rent. She also said the separation caused the family emotional strain.\par \par \uc2 "Because we grew up - he grew up with abuse, I grew up in an orphanage - ... we don't want this for our kids," she told the court.\par \par \uc2 In May, an immigration judge agreed that separating the family would cause "exceptional and extremely unusual hardship" and granted Haughton permanent residency. The government appealed the decision. Haughton remained in custody but has asked a federal court for a bond hearing.\par \par \uc2 The Supreme Court ruled in 2003 that mandatory detention of noncitizens with certain criminal records is constitutional for "the brief period necessary for their removal proceedings." At issue now is whether the many months that immigrants are spending in detention centers meet that standard.\par \par \uc2 The government argues that Congress chose to make detention mandatory and that delays caused by a detainee's appeals should not be used to justify the detainee's release.\par \par \uc2 "It is a statistical certainty ... that some of those criminal aliens will abscond and that some will commit further crimes that detention would have prevented," Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr. wrote in his brief to the Supreme Court.\par \par \uc2 A study by \uc2 Syracuse University\uc2  found that 14 percent of immigration detainees released on bond failed to return to court during fiscal 2015.\par \par \uc2 Advocates argue that the cases that last the longest are those in which the immigrant in question has the best chance of winning permanent residency - and thus is probably least deserving of indefinite detention.\par \par \uc2 "A large percentage are lawful green-card holders who committed a crime that \uc2 ICE\uc2  thinks might make them deportable," said C\u233\'00\'E9sar Cuauht\u233\'00\'E9moc Garc\u224\'00\'E0\u173\'00\'ADa Hern\u224\'00\'E0\u161\'00\'A1ndez, a professor at the University of Denver's Sturm College of Law. "These are people who are fully incorporated into U.S. society. ... It's hard to justify treating them differently because they're not citizens."\par \par \uc2 Haughton is not a green-card holder, and the government contends that his detention is not extraordinary or unwarranted. His continuing imprisonment is attributable to his own "belated decision to seek an adjustment of status," prosecutors argued in one court filing. \uc2 ICE\uc2  "vigorously disputes" the decision to grant him permanent residency, Assistant U.S. Attorney Lauren Wetzler wrote.\par \par \uc2 Yet U.S. District Judge Leonie M. Brinkema found that Haughton deserved a bond hearing, using a multi-part test as four federal appeals courts have done in similar cases. Advocates would rather see the Supreme Court adopt a standard applied by two other appellate courts and require bond hearings for all detainees after six months. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit, which includes Maryland and Virginia, is not one of those six appeals courts.\par \par \uc2 "It really is night and day with the kind of remedy and the kind of system you end up with," said Michael Tran, an immigration lawyer with the \uc2 ACLU\uc2 . In California, where the six-month rule applies, he said thousands have received hearings. In Delaware, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, where there is no firm time limit, only about two dozen immigrants have.\par \par \uc2 The Supreme Court could embrace one of the standards applied by the federal appeals courts, set yet another standard or rule that bond hearings are not required at all.\par \par \uc2 The justices could also decide whether the burden of proof in such a hearing would fall on the government or on the detainee, an issue that has divided lower courts. Prosecutors in Virginia are fighting Brinkema's decision to force the government to prove that Haughton is a flight risk or a danger.\par \par \uc2 Another question is what the court will make of the government's admission that the statistics it relied on in 2003 were wrong. The solicitor general had said that appealed cases take an average of 233 days to complete, or a little less than eight months. In fact, the office acknowledged in August that, on average, cases took 382 days, or more than a year.\par \par \uc2 In 2015, according to the Justice Department, the average case took 313 days, but that does not include the time a person spent in detention before filing or any post-decision court action.\par \par \uc2 Haughton is scheduled to get his bond hearing before an immigration judge on Wednesday, after 395 days in detention.\par \par \uc2 rachel.weiner@washpost.com \par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com \par \par \uc2 WP20161101detention1031\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020161101ecb10000e\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

Her co-workers used them to terrorize her. ; Alexandra Avila's lawsuit says she was bombarded with racist memes and words. She kept quiet because "she had to work with these people."\b0\par\par\uc2 By Cleve R. Wootson Jr. \par \uc2 1,285 \uc2 words\par \uc2 30 October 2016\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Angry Trump kept coming back.\par \par \uc2 Alexandra Avila's work computer usually displayed a smiling picture of her daughter. But when she logged in one morning last summer, she was greeted by a "belligerent looking picture of \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 ," a lawsuit says.\par \par \uc2 Again and again, she switched the desktop back to her daughter's photo. But two co-workers got an IT employee to break into Avila's computer to re-upload a sneering, pointing picture of Trump, according to the lawsuit.\par \par \uc2 "One co-worker told Alexandra that Mr. Trump was saying 'F-- you!' specifically to her," the\u160\'00\'A0lawsuit says.\par \par \uc2 The harassment only got worse for Avila, who was born in the United States and is\u160\'00\'A0of Mexican descent.\par \par \uc2 The people Avila worked with at \uc2 Sedgwick Claims Management Services\uc2  in Iowa\u160\'00\'A0bombarded her with racist memes, embarrassing her on group chats of more than\u160\'00\'A0a dozen people, the suit says.\par \par \uc2 One pictured a Hispanic man in an oversized sombrero. "No books," it said. "Only Manuels."\par \par \uc2 Avila's co-workers signed her up to volunteer for Trump's campaign, according to her lawsuit.\par \par \uc2 Once, a supervisor asked the team to vote on what food they wanted for a congratulatory potluck.\par \par \uc2 "Alex can't vote," a\u160\'00\'A0co-worker replied. "She's an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 ."\par \par \uc2 Avila started working in 2012 for \uc2 Sedgwick Claims Management Services\uc2 , which administers employee benefit programs for other companies. "At Sedgwick," the Memphis-based company likes to note, "caring counts."\par \par \uc2 Sedgwick employs 14,000 people in about 275 offices in the United States, Canada, the U.K. and Ireland, according to company literature.\par \par \uc2 Avila worked in\u160\'00\'A0Sedgwick's Iowa office, in Johnson County, where less than 6 percent of people identify as Hispanic, according to census data. Every day, from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., Avila handled family leave requests for \uc2 Walmart\uc2  employees.\par \par \uc2 She was fired by the company last November.\par \par \uc2 Her harassment and discrimination lawsuit was filed Monday and names her company and two former supervisors as defendants.\par \par \uc2 The supervisors did not respond to requests for comment.\par \par \uc2 Sedgwick Claims Management Services\uc2  said in a statement sent to The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2  that "we are aware that a suit has been filed by Alexandra Avila, a former colleague in our Coralville, Iowa, office. Prior to her dismissal for cause in 2015, Ms. Avila never reported any such activity to management or our colleague resource team. Sedgwick consistently maintains fair employment and workplace harassment practices, and we are confident the facts will prove Ms. Avila's case has no merit.\par \par \uc2 "Our company fosters a diverse, inclusive workplace in which all colleagues are encouraged to achieve their full potential; this is the foundation of our success."\par \par \uc2 Avila's alleged workplace troubles paralleled \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 's political rise: According to the lawsuit, the harassment started in earnest after Trump announced he was running for president in June 2015.\par \par \uc2 During a speech declaring his candidacy, he\u160\'00\'A0made incendiary comments about Mexicans and immigration.\par \par \uc2 "When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best," the man who would become the Republican nominee for president said. " ... They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people."\par \par \uc2 As the Associated Press noted, Trump's\u160\'00\'A0rhetoric has contributed to racial tensions across the country.\par \par \uc2 "Build a wall" chants have been used by high school students to taunt Latino opponents at sporting events in multiple states, including Iowa, Wisconsin and Indiana, the AP noted.\par \par \uc2 "With the political climate the way that it is, it's a little more charged," said the principal of the Iowa school whose players were taunted. Dan Marburger, the principal at Perry High, told \uc2 CNN\uc2  that some of his students, at a school with an usually high percentage of minorities for that part of the state,\u160\'00\'A0feel that "this inflamed rhetoric is happening and it's okay. No one is stopping it. They see it in a presidential campaign and now it's okay for everyone to say this. It's almost a sense that you feel that you don't belong in your own country."\par \par \uc2 The only Hispanic person on her team of about a dozen, Avila was born in California and moved to Iowa as a child, her attorney said.\par \par \uc2 Trump's comments about Mexicans bothered Avila, and she confided in her co-workers, according to the lawsuit.\par \par \uc2 "Alexandra's coworkers knew she was upset by Mr. Trump's bigoted remarks, so they needled her about them," the lawsuit says.\par \par \uc2 The ensuing harassment took all forms \u8212\'20\'14 a snide \uc2 illegal\u160\'00\'A0immigrant\uc2  comment here, a dancing Trump GIF there,\u160\'00\'A0according to the lawsuit.\par \par \uc2 Avila told supervisors about the comments and messages, but they did not take action, the lawsuit says. Sometimes, they laughed too.\par \par \uc2 "It just kept getting worse and worse," Avila's attorney, Paige Fiedler, told The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2 . "She tried to pretend that these things weren't bothering her for a while because she had to work with these people. She's not someone who likes to make waves. \u8230\'20\'26 Until she got fired, I don't think she ever would have gone and complained outside the company."\par \par \uc2 The lawsuit says Avila was fired after a supervisor claimed she lied on timecards, although the suit says her supervisors' attitudes toward Hispanics factored into Avila's termination.\par \par \uc2 The lawsuit claims that she and other employees often worked overtime or through their unpaid lunch break and that a supervisor told them "to find a way to get all their work done and that they were not allowed to write down any overtime hours."\par \par \uc2 The\u160\'00\'A02015\u160\'00\'A0meeting where Avila was fired marked the first time she had heard about the timecard issue, the lawsuit says.\par \par \uc2 She was terminated and escorted out of the building; her now-former employers said they would send her personal property to her home, the lawsuit says.\par \par \uc2 Even though she was fired, the harassment did not stop, Avila claims.\par \par \uc2 When the company mailed her a box with some of her belongings, a piece of paper was included that read: "Just call me La Trumpa."\par \par \uc2 On the back of the paper, someone had written: "Illegal immigrants can't vote or work. Good luck finding a job."\par \par \uc2 In January, the lawsuit alleges,\u160\'00\'A0Sedgwick employees "continued to harass Alexandra on her \uc2 Facebook\uc2  page \u8212\'20\'14 greeting her with 'Hola Alex' and inviting her to a rally to see \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 , 'the next president of the United States.'"\par \par \uc2 In the lawsuit, which was filed Monday, Avila is suing for harassment and discrimination based on race and national origin. Her attorney said she is also entitled to damages for wage theft and emotional distress.\par \par \uc2 Fiedler said Avila sobbed as she recounted how she had\u160\'00\'A0to replace her daughter's picture on her computer's desktop over and over again:\par \par \uc2 "The fact that they went into her computer and they replaced this beautiful, beautiful picture of her child and they replaced it with a photo of \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  yelling and shaking a finger at her, really struck her and makes her feel violated," the lawsuit says.\par \par \uc2 Read more:\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 White supremacist stabs interracial couple after seeing them kiss at bar, police say\par \par \uc2 After blaze at firefighter's home, investigators arrest his neighbor \u8212\'20\'14 a former firefighter\par \par \uc2 'The ice cream is as bitter and cold as the owner': After tirade, Internet turns on woman's business\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020161028ecas002jq\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 the-fix\par {\*\bkmkstart toc9}{\*\bkmkend toc9}\b \uc2 The Clinton campaign had been getting ready to drop Alicia Machado on Trump for a long time \b0\par\par\uc2 By Peter W. Stevenson \par \uc2 942 \uc2 words\par \uc2 27 October 2016\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Khizr Khan's speech at the Democratic National Convention was everything \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 's presidential campaign wanted: a real emotional connection with voters, a bit of stagecraft that made for a memorable visual, and a story of patriotism and sacrifice coupled with a ringing endorsement. Three months later, Khan is still winning over voters for the Clinton team; he spent Wednesday campaigning for her in Virginia, and recently appeared in a powerful ad in which he told the story of his son's heroic sacrifice as a U.S. Army captain in Iraq.\par \par \uc2 Then there's\u160\'00\'A0Alicia Machado, the first winner of the Miss Universe contest after \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  purchased it, and whom Clinton mentioned during the first presidential debate in September (and also subsequently produced an advertisement with). Again, Clinton had found an enthusiastic ally \u8212\'20\'14 an American voter with a compelling story.\par \par \uc2 In both cases, the Clinton campaign got an added bonus: Trump took the bait, and got roped into an extended fight that distracted him from the issues and attacking Clinton herself.\par \par \uc2 Of course,\u160\'00\'A0it wasn't blind luck that put the Khans onstage, or drew Machado into the conversation about Trump's treatment of women. Rather, they involved\u160\'00\'A0efforts by the Clinton campaign that appeared to have been planned\u160\'00\'A0well in advance. Turns out, they were.\par \par \uc2 Emails released by \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  show that the Clinton campaign was aware of Machado's story in December 2015. It's unclear precisely when the campaign contacted her and persuaded her to film an ad, but Clinton's official \uc2 Twitter\uc2  account congratulated her on her impending U.S. citizenship in May, retweeting a taped interview with "Inside Edition" in which Machado\u160\'00\'A0detailed the way Trump demeaned her in the 1990s.\par \par \uc2 Still,\u160\'00\'A0the campaign held its cards close. Clinton herself didn't bring up Machado until the first presidential debate on Sept. 26, followed quickly by press interviews, then an ad. The timing worked out perfectly for the Clinton campaign; they made Trump's treatment of women an issue right before the Oct. 7\u160\'00\'A0release of his comments while at an "Access Hollywood" interview more than a decade ago.\par \par \uc2 That, in turn, led to Trump\u160\'00\'A0facing tough questions from the debate moderators just two days later \u8212\'20\'14\u160\'00\'A0and offering\u160\'00\'A0answers that prompted at least 11 more women to come forward. In the space of a few weeks, Machado's story became just one of many dominating the headlines just weeks before\u160\'00\'A0Election Day, as millions of Americans cast early votes.\par \par \uc2 Machado wasn't the only Clinton surrogate to grab headlines. Khizr Khan had been profiled by The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2  in 2005, after his son Humayun was killed while serving in the \uc2 U.S. Army\uc2  in Iraq, and he'd spoken out against Trump in a few interviews in the winter of 2015.\par \par \uc2 Although the campaign probably knew Khizr Khan's speech would resonate in the arena and with viewers on television, it never could have predicted Trump's aggressive response. After all, who insults a Gold Star family?\par \par \uc2 He did, though, and that opened the door for the Clinton campaign to retell their story in an emotional ad (and on the trail). Suddenly, a speaker with virtually no\u160\'00\'A0name recognition was transformed into a months-long campaign storyline.\par \par \uc2 The Trump campaign has proven less adept at finding such voters and showcasing their stories. Of course, the Trump team faced additional challenges in long-term planning \u8212\'20\'14 including, for months, a skeleton communications staff. Some\u160\'00\'A0of the Trump campaign's strategies were also undoubtedly affected by a shifting chain of command, and a candidate who could never quite seem to stay on message.\par \par \uc2 Pat Smith, whose son Sean died in the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya, was given a speaking slot at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, where she emotionally accused Clinton of being directly responsible for her son's death (although\u160\'00\'A0as she addressed the convention, Trump spoke on Fox News Channel, pulling their cameras away from Smith's remarks). Trump also brought her to the final presidential debate as a guest.\u160\'00\'A0But the campaign has not made a sustained effort to highlight her story \u8212\'20\'14 or the stories of other ordinary people that he has used to make the case on one of his signature issues: immigration.\par \par \uc2 In theory,\u160\'00\'A0"angel moms" -- mothers whose sons or daughters were killed by illegal immigrants, whose stories he occasionally told at rallies \u8212\'20\'14 bolstered his argument for stronger immigration laws. But\u160\'00\'A0the sustained campaign effort that the Clinton team used to tell Machado's story, and that of the Khans,\u160\'00\'A0just wasn't there. The same goes for Jamiel Shaw, the father of a Los Angeles teenager who was killed by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  in 2008.\par \par \uc2 Trump also held a news conference with several of former president \uc2 Bill Clinton\uc2 's accusers \u8212\'20\'14 although,\u160\'00\'A0coming without warning immediately\u160\'00\'A0before a presidential debate, it felt more like a tactic intended to knock \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  off her\u160\'00\'A0game\u160\'00\'A0rather than a\u160\'00\'A0voter outreach effort.\par \par \uc2 Khizr Khan's story won't be a decisive factor in the election, nor will Machado's, or the "angel moms," or Shaw's. But their stories do help voters connect with candidates. They humanize the campaign, and show us how proposed policies affect real people, or how a candidate's decision-making affected them in a real-life situation.\par \par \uc2 When you look at whose stories have connected the most with voters, it's hard not to put the Khans and Machado at the top of the list.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020161027ecar005pm\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The Texas Tribune reports:\par \par \uc2 Republican presidential candidate \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  held a three-percentage-point lead over Democrat \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  on the eve of early voting in Texas, according to the latest University of Texas/Texas Tribune Poll. \u8230\'20\'26\u160\'00\'A0While 93 percent of Democrats support Clinton, 83 percent of Republicans and 46 percent of independents support Trump. Only 19 percent of independents said they support Clinton. And there is a big divide on racial and ethnic lines: Trump led Clinton 57 percent to 28 percent among white voters, but Clinton led 95 percent to 4 percent among black voters and 56 percent to 33 percent among Hispanic voters.\par \par \uc2 This is remarkable not only because Texas is a deep-red state but also because, if there is any place that should be anxious about illegal immigration, it is Texas. Come to think of it, Arizona is another border state. And yet Trump is struggling in both places. Trump's build-the-wall and mass deportation proposals don't sell in Arizona and Texas.\par \par \uc2 We've long remarked that the anti-immigrant nuttery is strong in places with virtually no illegal immigration. The Post\u160\'00\'A0reported in 2014 on a Pew research report:\par \par \uc2 California, the most populous state, is home to the most [illegal immigrants]: nearly 2.5 million undocumented immigrants. Texas is home to nearly 1.7 million. Six states \u8212\'20\'14 Maine, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont and West Virginia \u8212\'20\'14 have fewer than 5,000 undocumented immigrants. Nationally, there are 11.2 million such immigrants in all.\par \par \uc2 When you look at states in which less than 1 percent of the population is illegal immigrants, you'll find hotbeds of furor (West Virginia, Kentucky, Mississippi). The coal country folks think illegal immigrants are putting them out of work? In Ohio, illegal immigrants make up less than 1 percent of the population; in Pennsylvania, the number is 1.3 percent.\par \par \uc2 Moreover, we know that illegal immigration is on the decline, despite Trump's pearl-clutching. The 2014 Pew study found: "Mexicans are a majority of unauthorized immigrants (52% in 2012), but both their numbers and share have declined in recent years, according to the Pew Research estimates. Although the U.S. population of unauthorized immigrants was stable from 2009 to 2012, the number of Mexicans in this population fell by about half a million people during those years. According to the new \uc2 Pew Research Center\uc2  estimates, there were 5.9 million Mexican unauthorized immigrants in 2012, compared with 6.4 million in 2009. The decline likely resulted from both an increase in departures to Mexico and a decrease in arrivals from Mexico."\par \par \uc2 This tells us a few things:\par \par \uc2 * Trump's anti-immigrant extremism plays poorly in places with direct experiences with large numbers of illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 * The combination of Hispanic voters and white voters disdainful of Trump's bigotry and misogyny undermines the notion that this is a winning issue for the GOP.\par \par \uc2 * The anti-immigration fervor is stoked in places and among people who are not affected by illegal immigration and have little, if any, experience with crime (which Trump would have us believe is epidemic) committed by illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 * Illegal immigration from Mexico has been declining. Trump still focuses on such immigrants, even as Asians\u160\'00\'A0become the largest share of the \uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2  population.\par \par \uc2 To be clear, the anti-immigration fetish is not based on economic or safety concerns, at least not real ones. Trump is whipping up bigotry, plain and simple, using made-up facts and hysterical rhetoric. Texas and Arizona can make a powerful statement on Election Day, rejecting xenophobia and undermining the "myth of the white voter." In doing so, these red states may accelerate a much-needed fumigation of the GOP -- and demonstrate an appetite for inclusive candidates from the center-right.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020161027ecar004mz\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 the-fix\par {\*\bkmkstart toc11}{\*\bkmkend toc11}\b \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 's campaign has become one big airing of grievances ; About 15 percent of Trump's public comments in recent days have been complaints about the election and the media.\b0\par\par\uc2 By Aaron Blake \par \uc2 7,196 \uc2 words\par \uc2 27 October 2016\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  spoke with \uc2 CNN\uc2 's Dana Bash for five and a half minutes on Wednesday. During that brief conversation, he managed to complain about "insulting" and "rude" questions, \uc2 CNN\uc2  underselling his chances, and not getting enough credit for leading in Florida\u160\'00\'A0even though he's being outspent "50 to 1."\par \par \uc2 "You know, in the old days, you'd get credit if you would spend less money and have victory," Trump said. "That would be a good thing."\par \par \uc2 This, of course, is nothing new for Trump. His entire campaign these days is built on\u160\'00\'A0the premise that the system is rigged -- rigged both against average Americans but also against him personally. And as the polls suggest a loss is imminent, he's taken to offering plenty of excuses for it, up to and including massive yet-to-occur voter fraud.\par \par \uc2 But\u160\'00\'A0the sheer volume of these grievances in recent days is remarkable.\par \par \uc2 The Fix looked over the \uc2 CNN\uc2  interview and the other four most recent Trump campaign appearances for which we have a full transcript, all of them rallies on Florida: Tallahassee and Sanford on Tuesday, and Tampa and St. Augustine on Monday.\par \par \uc2 Over the course of those five appearances, Trump spent about 15 percent of the time -- 3,300 words out of nearly 22,000 spoken -- litigating his problems with the media and a political system that he argues is aiding his opponent in myriad unfair ways.\par \par \uc2 This is admittedly a subjective exercise, but The Fix went through these transcripts seeking out not just instances in which Trump argues the system is "rigged," but that it's rigged against him personally and/or in his opponent's favor.\par \par \uc2 The high water mark was Tuesday in Sanford, Fla., when Trump spent about one-fifth of his lengthy speech explaining why things were unfair to him.\u160\'00\'A0He even began his speech with a gripe.\par \par \uc2 "I was just coming in, watching Fox say there are very few people here. Do you believe these people?" he said. "They'll do anything, every one of them. Every one of them.\u160\'00\'A0I'll tell you what: The media, folks, is no good. They're no good -- very dishonest."\par \par \uc2 It progressed from there. Among Trump's complaints:\par \par \uc2 * That the media ignores Trump supporters: "When they interview the people standing on the line and they say, 'Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump.' They say, 'All right, let's get out of here. This is bad. This is bad news.'"\par \par \uc2 * That he wasn't given enough credit for predicting Brexit: "And I said, 'It's going to happen.' And they criticized me."\par \par \uc2 * That media coverage is suppressing his vote: "It's called voter suppression, because people give up."\par \par \uc2 * That \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  was somehow provided the questions prior to the last debate and there is a double standard: "Can you imagine if I got the answers or the questions to a debate? It would be the electric chair, right? No, no, it would be the biggest story in the world."\par \par \uc2 * That the premium increases under Obamacare are being undersold: "Now, they said 25 percent. Forget -- you'll take 25 percent. It's going to be 60, 70, 80, 90 percent."\par \par \uc2 * That the Washington establishment is working against him: "The fact that the Washington establishment has tried so hard to stop our campaign which is actually a movement."\par \par \uc2 * That fact-checkers don't give him the benefit of the doubt: "They'll check facts with me and I'm like 99 percent right and they'll say, 'And therefore, he lied.' ...\u160\'00\'A0What a group of people we have. What a group of dishonest scum we have, I'm telling you."\par \par \uc2 The complaints are generally similar from speech to speech, though Trump does mix in a new one every so often. The idea that the media coverage and the polls are suppressing his vote is a rather new one. Trump has also argued with gusto in recent days that his opponent shouldn't even be allowed to run against him.\par \par \uc2 And it all serves a political purpose: To reinforce the idea that very powerful forces are doing whatever they can to prevent him from becoming president.\par \par \uc2 That's a message\u160\'00\'A0that serves Trump both in the case he's making to voters and in the excuses he may offer after the election -- assuming he does lose and maybe doesn't concede. If the system is rigged against you and everything was unfair, after all, your loss wasn't really a legitimate one, and your movement must continue to fight back.\par \par \uc2 In other words: Expect many more grievances in the days and weeks ahead.\par \par \uc2 And just so we're showing our work, here is a full transcript of Trump's Sanford appearance, with the grievances portions highlighted:\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: This is a big crowd.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 I was just -- I was just coming in, watching Fox say there are very few people here. Do you believe these people?\par \par \uc2 AUDIENCE: No.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Well, they'll do anything, every one of them; every one of them.\par \par \uc2 I'll tell you what, the media, folks, is no good. They're no good; very dishonest.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 In 14 days, we're going to win the state of Florida. We're going to win back the White House.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 We are going to win Florida. And by the way, the lines at the voting booths are record.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 And I notice that a lot of the people on lines -- you see the pictures -- they're wearing the red hat, the white hat, this hat. They're wearing all -- they're wearing buttons all over the place. I think those are people that are inclined to vote for us. Do you agree?\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 So this was supposed to be a rally in that hangar. And after the first hour, they realized that wasn't going to work too well. That's fantastic. Thank you, everybody. Look at that.(APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: We're going to have a big victory. The lines are record- setting, which I knew they'd be. And a lot of people are being very surprised. It's very, very surprising. We're getting a big vote. So it's going to be a little early to tell you what those numbers are, but it's a big, big vote in the state of Florida.\par \par \uc2 We are leading Iowa. We are leading Ohio. We are doing great in North Carolina. Pennsylvania, we are going to a lot. I think we're going to do great there. They put the miners out of work. We're putting the miners back to work. I think we're going to do great there.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Seventy-five percent of the American people think our country is on the wrong track. Every poll says it. We are going to fix it and we are going to get our country back on the right track very, very quickly.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Together, we are going to deliver real change that once again puts America first.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 That begins with immediately repealing and replacing the disaster known as Obamacare.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 You saw what happened yesterday. The rates are going through the sky. We all knew that. I knew it before it was passed. I have been saying this for a long time. My first day in office, I'm going to ask Congress to put a bill on my desk getting rid of this disastrous law, and replacing it with reforms that expand choice, freedom, affordability. You're going to have such great health care at a tiny fraction of the cost and it's going to be so easy.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 It's just been announced that Americans are going to experience another massive double-digit hike. Now, they said 25 percent. Forget -- you'll take 25 percent. It's going to be 60, 70, 80, 90 percent. In the great state of Arizona, it is over 100 percent. It is crazy. One in five Americans trapped in Obamacare will only have a single insurer to negotiate with in your state. Congratulations. Lots of fun. You're going to have to brush up on your negotiation ability, believe me. Even \uc2 Bill Clinton\uc2  admitted Obamacare is the craziest thing in the world, where people wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half. And then he was forced to take it back the following day because that night he suffered greatly. He suffered.\par \par \uc2 (LAUGHTER)\par \par \uc2 Because \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  wants to double-up and triple-up on Obamacare, the numbers will go through the roof. Your taxes will double and triple, and in the end it's not affordable. You can't do it.\par \par \uc2 The Democratic governor of Minnesota said the Affordable Act -- remember this -- the Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable. He doesn't know what to do. But I -- I said this before it was passed. It couldn't have worked in a million years. Insurers are leaving. Companies are fleeing. And by the way, it's putting your companies out of business. It's putting your small businesses out of business.\par \par \uc2 And \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  -- here is another thing you can say. I'm going to repeal it and replace it. She is going to expand it and it's going to get more and more expensive. And it's no good anyway because the deductibles are so high -- I mean, unless you have a really long- term serious problem at the highest level, you're never going to be able to use it, folks.\par \par \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  wants to double-down on Obamacare and make it even worse. She wants to put the government totally in charge of your health care despite the fact it's no good. It'll be much more expensive than even today.\par \par \uc2 (BOOING)\par \par \uc2 Repealing Obamacare and stopping Hillary's health care takeover is one of the single most important reasons that we must win on November 8th.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Boy, this is a big crowd, by the way. A lot of people. That's a lot of people.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 AUDIENCE: Trump! Trump! Trump!\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Thank you. You know, it is funny, because you know, you listen to this phony media. I get a call an hour ago. They say, "Sir, we have a problem." I said, "Oh, here we go. What is it?" They said this, and I laugh, but they said, "The people don't fit into the hangar." I said, "But that's a good problem, isn't it?" Change has to come from outside our corrupt system. The fact that the Washington establishment has tried so hard to stop our campaign which is actually a movement. This is a movement, folks.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 And this is the last time we're going to have a chance. Four years, it's over. It's over. In four years, you don't have a chance. All these characters who want to run in four years, they can forget it. They're wasting their time. You don't have even a little bit of a chance. This is it. And we're really close.\par \par \uc2 We're going to win Florida, by the way.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 No, no. These guys won't tell you that because they don't want to hear about it. But when they interview -- these are the most corrupt people. When they interview the people standing on the line and they say, "Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump." They say, "All right, let's get out of here, this is bad. This is bad news."\par \par \uc2 These are the most dishonest, almost as dishonest as crooked Hillary.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 I love those pink signs, "Women for Trump."\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 I love the signs behind me, "Blacks for Trump." I like those signs.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 "Blacks for Trump." You watch. You watch. Those signs are great. Thank you.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Going to be a lot of Brexit happening in about two weeks. Lot of Brexit.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Remember that. Everybody went to bed. They said, "Oh gee, I think it's not going..."\par \par \uc2 And I said, "It's going to happen." And they criticized me: "Can you believe this guy? Can you believe this guy?" Just like crooked Hillary. She had a rally -- you know her rallies last for about 15 minutes and there are very few people. But she talked about how we want peace at our rallies and this and that. She hired people -- thugs -- to go into my rallies -- 1,500 -- right? Listen to this -- $1,500 and an iPhone. "Go into the rally and beat people up."\par \par \uc2 AUDIENCE: Lock her up. Lock her up. Lock her up.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: "Go into the rally and beat people up." And you remember in Pennsylvania, different places, in Chicago, remember that one? Where they were fighting. They found out our people are not so easy to beat up, that's for sure. But do you remember? Remember they went in and there was a policeman with blood pouring down his face. There was another one with a badly gashed -- this was all thugs put in there. And then I'm listening to her talk about peace at our rallies -- "We want peace."\par \par \uc2 This is one of the great phonies of all time and she shouldn't be allowed to run for president with what she's done, I'll tell you right now.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 The fact that the Washington establishment has tried so hard to stop this movement is only more proof that our campaign represents the kind of change that only arrives once in a lifetime. This is once in a lifetime.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 I'm telling you. I opened the door. I looked out the window. I said, "Wow, it's so different from what they report." These people up here, they are the worst. And you know what it's called? By the way, you know what it's called, don't you? It's called voter suppression, because people give up. People give up.\par \par \uc2 And we're going to win Florida and we're going to win Iowa, and we're going to win Ohio. Right?\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 And I think we're going to win Pennsylvania...\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 ... and we're going to win North Carolina. We're going to have a lot of victories. Just keep it going, folks. We're fighting the crooked establishment and just about the biggest part of the crooked establishment are these people right back there with the phony cameras.\par \par \uc2 (BOOING)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: They're a bunch of phony low-lifes. And remember Obama last week? The campaigning president. He doesn't get you jobs. He gives you lousy healthcare that you're going to pay so much for you're not going to be able to afford it. You can't afford it now. He can't beat ISIS. He's a lousy president.\par \par \uc2 And you remember when I said that some of the voting is rigged? OK, everybody knows. Check out Philadelphia, Chicago, St. Louis. And he said this is a threat to our system. This is terrible, this is a threat. OK, I figured, gee whiz, wow, that's pretty bad. Except last night on television -- last night I'm watching Obama from eight years ago and he's basically saying that the whole thing is fixed.\par \par \uc2 (LAUGHTER)\par \par \uc2 Before he won his first race, he was talking about voting and he said, remember, I come from Chicago, you know, I mean, you know -- give me a break, this guy's such a phony guy. What a phony.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 What a phony group. Take a look, you got to look at it, you got to look at it. A clip last night, in fact. It was on Sean Hannity, you got look at it. And you see that -- I said I don't believe that he would have said that after knowing (inaudible). But basically, he said it's rigged and he said, I know because I come from Chicago. Give me a break, what a phony guy.\par \par \uc2 Real change begins with ridding Washington of corruption, of which there's plenty going around.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 And believe me, folks. Believe me, folks, I've been saying it for a long time. The system, the whole system is rigged. The whole system is rigged. Go back to Obamacare for a second. Remember Obama, you can keep your plan, you can keep your doctor. He said it 28 different times, keep the plan, keep the doctor. Keep your plan, keep your doctor. He lied. Remember he had \uc2 Jonathan Gruber\uc2  of MIT, where my uncle was a professor for 35 years -- but he had \uc2 Jonathan Gruber\uc2  from MIT and he was the architect of the plan.\par \par \uc2 And remember, he called the American people stupid, stupid for going along with Obamacare. Then he tried to take it back. He couldn't take it back, it was a disaster. The problem is, folks, they all have a memory, including us. Two weeks and we forget. But I don't forget. And you know what, I bring it up. \uc2 Jonathan Gruber\uc2  said the American people are essentially stupid for approving and allowing Obamacare to happen.\par \par \uc2 And you know what? We've got to show them on November 8th that we're not stupid. We're not stupid.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 And here's another beauty, a breaking news story today provides one of the most shocking revelations to date. As you may remember, President Obama claimed to have no knowledge whatsoever of Clinton's -- \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 's illegal email server. I have no knowledge of it, I don't know. This guy, he's as bad as she is. And he's got to stop campaigning and bring us some jobs, OK?\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 That jeopardized national security, her email server. But newly public emails, \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2 , prove otherwise. A Clinton spokesman, Josh Waren (ph), sent an email saying, quote, "looks like the president just said he found out \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  was using her personal email when he saw it on the news."\par \par \uc2 Oh, that's nice. But \uc2 Cheryl Mills\uc2 , Clinton's chief of staff, the State Department, replied, quote -- listen to this -- "We need to clean this up. He has the e-mails from her." They do not say state.gov, they don't say it. In other words, Mills was saying Obama, he had to know that Hillary was using an illegal server, but he claimed otherwise.\par \par \uc2 So that means Obama is now into the act. And now I understand that despite his hatred of the Clintons -- because I know one thing, Bill hates him -- but despite his hatred, now I understand why he pushed her, because he didn't want to get caught up in the big lie. He's caught up now, folks.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: We have to investigate the investigation -- this investigation. So listen to this. Crooked \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  bleached and deleted 33,000 emails, lied to Congress under oath, made 13 iPhones disappear, some with a hammer, then told the \uc2 FBI\uc2  she couldn't remember 39 times. Bad memory.\par \par \uc2 AUDIENCE: Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up!\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Incredible. But we have also just learned that one of the closest people to \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 , with longstanding ties to her and husband, the closest -- the closest person, I can tell you that, gave more -- listen to this -- just happened yesterday.\par \par \uc2 Gave more than $675,000 to the campaign of the wife of a top \uc2 FBI\uc2  official who oversaw the investigation into Mrs. Clinton's illegal e- mail server. In other words -- in other words...\par \par \uc2 (BOOING)\par \par \uc2 ... the man who was in charge of the investigation of \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  accepted essentially from \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  $675,000 that went to his wife.\par \par \uc2 (BOOING)\par \par \uc2 Never happened before. Never happened. Not in this country's history. This is a disgrace. And she shouldn't be allowed to run for president. She shouldn't be allowed. She's a crook.\par \par \uc2 Remember this. Remember this. Just remember this. So important. \uc2 Donna Brazile\uc2 , head of \uc2 DNC\uc2 , got the answers to a debate and the questions to a debate. So she has the questions. She gave them to crooked Hillary. And I don't know if you saw \uc2 Donna Brazile\uc2  the other night on television. What a -- what a mess that was, the way she -- she didn't know what to do.\par \par \uc2 Well, how did you get them? Well, it was sent by Russia, Russia.\par \par \uc2 (LAUGHTER)\par \par \uc2 You know, they're always using Russia, like I have -- I have nothing to do with Russia. They were sent by Russia and \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 , you know. These people -- and yet they have more -- because \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  gave them 20 percent of our uranium -- gave Russia for a big payment. And her man has to do with Russia -- the whole thing -- they're a bunch of crooks. I'm telling you, our country is in such trouble. So \uc2 Donna Brazile\uc2  has the questions. She gives them to crooked Hillary. OK. Now, here's what I'd like. Wouldn't it be great if crooked Hillary -- you know, it's funny. I wonder if she had the questions the other night to our debate, because everybody tells me I killed her in that debate, which I think I did.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Which I think I did.\par \par \uc2 So \uc2 Donna Brazile\uc2  gives her all of the questions. And what happens? Hillary should turn them in, of course. Right? "Listen, I can't do this; it's" -- she didn't turn them in. She used them. And we found out through \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  that this happened.\par \par \uc2 And nobody goes after her. Can you imagine if I got the answers or the questions to a debate? It would be the electric chair, right? No, no, it would be the biggest story in the world. And they're not doing anything with \uc2 Donna Brazile\uc2 . And they're not doing anything with crooked \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 . She got the answers to a debate. She got the questions to debate.\par \par \uc2 And she didn't turn herself in, meaning, "I'm sorry; I'm not supposed to have this." By the way, what a great act that would have been if she did it. We would have all been shocked if she did it. But wouldn't that have been nice?\par \par \uc2 The criminal conduct of \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  threatens the foundations of democracy. I mean that.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 But we're going to turn it around, folks. I've proposed a contract with the American voter that will give the government back to the people.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 And just so you understand -- and you know this. I didn't need this. I didn't need this. I was doing very well on the other side. I was, you know, definitely doing well. I didn't need this, but I'll tell you I love our country. I had to do it. I see where our country is going, and it's not good. It's really bad.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 My contract begins with a plan to end the rampant government corruption, and to put the special interests out of business. It's all about special interests. I want everyone in Washington to hear and to heed the words I'm about to say.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: If we win on November 8th, we are going to Washington, D.C. and we, together, are going to drain the swamp.\par \par \uc2 AUDIENCE: Drain the swamp!\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Under my contract with the American voter, we are proposing a series of ethics reforms on day one to end government corruption. They include a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Important. A lifetime ban on government officials lobbying for a foreign government. Do you believe this?\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 They get out, the lobby for -- they make a fortune. A total ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for American elections. Thank you very much, we don't need your money.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Under my contract, I'm also going to take a series of actions on day one to protect American workers. We are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world. They are taking our companies, they are taking our jobs, and our politicians, many of whom are stupid and many of whom are corrupt, are allowing it to happen. We're not going to allow it any longer.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Our nation has lost one-third of its manufacturing jobs since \uc2 NAFTA\uc2 , a deal signed by \uc2 Bill Clinton\uc2  and supported strongly by \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 . And by the way, the single worst trade deal ever made in history anywhere. Listen to this. Hard to believe. I've told you before I thought this was a typographical error. We've lost 70,000 factories since China entered the \uc2 World Trade Organization\uc2 , \uc2 WTO\uc2 , another Bill and Hillary backed disaster.\par \par \uc2 But they've been nicely paid. Look at all the money they have pouring in; $250 million and they've been in government. It's a good government job. My contract includes the following. We will renegotiate \uc2 NAFTA\uc2  or withdraw from the deal to get a much better one for our workers and our companies.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 It's a one-way street. You know what I call it? It's a one-way highway right into Mexico. They get our jobs, they get our money, they get our plants and factories. You know what we get? Drugs and unemployment. That's what we get. We get nothing. It's a defective agreement, too, totally defective.\par \par \uc2 We will withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, another beauty. The deal \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  called the gold standard and then during the debate, she lied. She said, "I never said that." Unfortunately at the next debate, they announced she did say it. And she also said she never was secretary of State when they talked about the red line in the sand. "I wasn't secretary of State then," right? Remember? "I wasn't" -- she lied, she was.\par \par \uc2 Even the so-called fact checkers -- who are really crooked as hell themselves, by the way. These fact checkers, they'll check facts with me and I'm like 99 percent right and they'll say "and therefore, he lied." I've gone through them where I've said OK, finally. They say "and therefore, he lied." Oh, boy, these people are bad. What a group of people we have. What a group of dishonest scum we have, I'm telling you.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Hillary's Wall Street donors want it and she'd approve it. If she ever got the chance, she will approve TPP so fast and she intends to. Tim Kaine has even left the door open to passing TPP by another name. Let's change the name.\par \par \uc2 And by the way, folks. We're going to win. But regardless, don't let it happen. It's too complicated. You do one deal with another. One, one, one. Make individual deals with individual nations, deal with the ones we want to deal with. You've got to see what this thing looks like, a piece of Swiss cheese. And if they default, you send them a letter of default and by the time that 30 day notice ends, you'll have a new deal that's even better. TRUMP: This deal is too complicated, it's almost 6,000 pages long and here's the thing. All of these other countries, they've read every single word, every comma, every period, every paragraph. I'll bet we have nobody that even reads these things, OK? And you're talking about bigger than running big companies. These are bigger deals. You can take a modest-size trade deal, it's bigger than these big companies. And we have people that are political hacks negotiate it.\par \par \uc2 Not anymore. We have the greatest -- I am endorsed by some of the greatest business people in the world. We are going to use our great business people to make these deals.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 We will lift the restrictions on the production of American energy, which is getting clobbered with the \uc2 EPA\uc2 , and by the way, and with the restrictions -- including shale, oil, natural gas, and clean coal. We are putting our miners back to work.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Hillary want to shut down American energy and put the miners out of work. She said it, "We want the mines and the miners out of work." That's nice; horrible. We are going to put the miners, the steel workers, and so many of our other workers that are being clobbered by the stupidity of our government's leadership -- we are going to put them back to work. That includes the steel workers.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 It's going to happen fast, too. It doesn't take long time, folks. It's going to go fast.\par \par \uc2 Additionally, on the first day, I will take the following actions to restore the rule of law. These include I will cancel every illegal Obamacare executive order. We will cancel all federal funding to sanctuary cities. Out.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 We will suspend immigration from regions comprised of radical Islamic terrorists, including the suspension of the Syrian refugee program which is taking in thousands and thousands of people that we have no idea where they come from, no idea who they are. And crooked \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  wants to have that increased by 550 percent over and above the crazy Obama numbers. OK?\par \par \uc2 (BOOING)\par \par \uc2 Tell you what: You vote for her, you're crazy. OK? She is the worst.\par \par \uc2 Next, I will work with Congress to introduce a series of legislative reforms and will fight for their passage in the first 100 days of my administration. And this legislation quickly includes Middle Class Tax Relief and Simplification Act.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 So essentially a middle class family with two children will get about a 35 percent tax reduction. Isn't that nice? It's about time. The middle class in our country has been devastated. And by the way, crooked Hillary wants to raise your taxes up to the sky. She wants to raise. We are the highest taxed in the world. She wants to raise your taxes right up to the sky.\par \par \uc2 And the Off-Shoring Act establishes tariffs to companies from laying off their workers and relocating to other countries, which is a disaster for us. We have companies -- all -- I could name 100 if you have all day. I could name a thousand. They close. They move to Mexico or some other place. They make their product. They sell it to us. We end up with unemployment all over. We end up with no taxes. We end up with closed plants, and they make a fortune in the other countries.\par \par \uc2 So here is the story, folks, and I say it whether it's cars, air conditioners. They want to close up and put our people out of work. Go someplace else build a new plant. And you know the friend of mine who said all -- that he's never seen. It's the eighth wonder of the world. He said the plants and factories that he is building in Mexico, "Donald, " he's the biggest, "is the eighth wonder of the world."\par \par \uc2 I said: "What about the United States?" He goes, "Not so much." Nothing. It's so sad. It's so sad. So they want to build something and they want to have their new plant and they want to have non-U.S. workers. That's fine. Everything is fine. But they are going to pay a 35 percent tax every time that air conditioner or car comes across the border\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 And you know what? Nobody is going to move. Here is the story folks. Couple of politicians said, "I have never thought of that"; couldn't think of it. They have been working at this thing for 10 years, they never thought. So either they're taken care of or they're stupid, right? Or both?\par \par \uc2 So here what's going to happen, though. Nobody is going to move. And if they do move, that's OK too cause we are going to make a fortune, OK? So its not the worst thing in the world. TRUMP: American Infrastructure Act -- $1 trillion in public- private infrastructure investments. This includes help for projects like expanding the Orlando Sanford International Airport. You like that idea? Why not? It's true. They have been looking to do it for a long time.\par \par \uc2 End illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 I have to tell you, our infrastructure, folks, is a mess. We are like a third-world country. We have an infrastructure that's so bad, our roads, our highways, our schools, our tunnels, our bridges. Look at our bridges. Half of them have reports that they are in serious danger.\par \par \uc2 We will build the wall and we will impose tough mandatory minimum -- remember this -- tough mandatory minimum prison sentences for deported illegal immigrants who try to reenter the country. They keep coming back and back and back.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 And if they know they go away for five years if we catch them, they're not coming back, folks How simple is it? How simple is it?\par \par \uc2 Thousands of Americans have been killed by illegal immigrants. In January of last year -- and you probably heard this story. Everybody's heard this story. Grant (inaudible), 21-years-old, a beautiful, beautiful young person was working at a convenience store in Mesa, Arizona when he was shot in the face point-blank by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  for no reason.\par \par \uc2 The killer was out on bond. He was roaming free, despite many previous arrests and violence. And the word from other people that knew him, please do not let him go free. Shot this young man right in the face.\par \par \uc2 In another incident, 25-year-old Spencer (inaudible) was sitting in his car at a stoplight after dropping off his girlfriend. An \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  in a pickup truck pulled up beside Spencer and without saying anything and for no reason, took out a gun, pointed it at his head and pulled the trigger, killing him instantly.\par \par \uc2 The killer had been deported four times. We weren't supposed to take him back. We took him back. He had a massive lengthy criminal record. And people said please don't take this guy back. Dead. By the way, hundreds of stories, hundreds. I've spent a lot of time with Spencer's mom, Julie. A member of the Remembrance Project, one of the great groups of people, they are devastated. They are devastated.\par \par \uc2 Sixty-year-old Margaret (inaudible) was shot to death by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  last July in Ohio. Earlier that day, her killer attempted to rape a 14-year-old girl, shot a third woman in the arm while he was with her children and did massive other damage to other people. Police encountered the man more than three weeks before the crime spree, but federal authorities refused to take him into custody even though they knew he was very dangerous. They didn't want to get involved.\par \par \uc2 So you have carnage. This crime wave ends when \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  becomes president. Believe me.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 , on the other hand, is totally for open borders -- there goes your country -- which would mean the destruction of our country. It would really mean that. You got to have to have borders. If you don't have borders, we don't have a country.\par \par \uc2 She also wants to expand illegal executive amnesty, which would be really -- shred -- it would shred our Constitution.\par \par \uc2 Restoring National Security Act, which will eliminate the Obama- Clinton defense sequester, allow us to rebuild our military and gives veterans -- how many veterans?\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 The right to seek private medical care when they can't get proper service. The veterans are waiting on (ph) line for six, seven, eight days. They can't even get to see a doctor. Twenty-two suicides a day from our veterans. Do you believe that number? Twenty-two a day.\par \par \uc2 Under my plan, not only will we modernize our Navy's cruisers, but we'll also invest in the technologies of the future being developed right here in central Florida. My plan also includes major investments in space exploration, also right here. You know what we call this place.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Over the last eight years, the Obama-Clinton administration has undermined our space program tremendously. That will change. So many good things come out of it, including great jobs. And it will change very quickly under a Trump administration and it will change before it is too late. TRUMP: Do you ever see what's going on with space, with Russia and different places and us? We're like -- we're like watching. Isn't that nice? So much is learned from that, too.\par \par \uc2 As a cornerstone of my policy, we will substantially expand public-private partnerships to maximize the amount of investment and funding that is available for space exploration and development.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 This means launching and operating major space assets right here that employ thousands and spur innovation and fuel economic growth. I will free \uc2 NASA\uc2  from the restriction of serving primarily as a logistics agency for low-earth orbit activity. Big deal.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Instead, we will refocus its mission on space exploration. Under a Trump administration, Florida and America will lead the way into the stars. With a victory in November, everything will change. Just think about what we can accomplish in the first 100 days.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 In closing, we're going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan, and actually even bigger.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 We're going to eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation. They're choking our businesses to death. We're going to provide school choice and put an end to common core and bring our education local.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 We're going to support our great men and women of law enforcement.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 We will save our Second Amendment, which is totally under siege.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 And appoint justices to the \uc2 Supreme Court of the United States\uc2  who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Republicans have to finally get smart and come together. This is our last chance. This is bigger than me or any of us. It's about our country. This is about ending Obamacare. This is about the Supreme Court. This is about rebuilding our military and taking care of our vets, strengthening our borders and keeping our companies and jobs from leaving our beloved country.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 This is about restoring the rule of law, saving our Constitution, and keeping radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 I invite all Americans -- Republicans, Democrats, independents, first-time voters -- to join this incredible movement, a movement the likes of which has never been witnessed in this country before -- never, never, never been anything like this.\par \par \uc2 Let's not blow it, folks -- November 8th. Get out sooner if you can. It's a movement powered by our love for America and our love for our fellow citizens. We're in a divided country. We're going to bring everybody together, not just the people here. We're going to bring everybody together. We're going to fix our inner cities.\par \par \uc2 I'll tell you what, our inner cities are so, so bad right now. The danger, the crime, the lack of education, no jobs. African Americans are living in hell in our -- in the inner cities. I mean, they're living -- they're living in hell. You walk to the store for a loaf of bread; you get shot.\par \par \uc2 We're going to fix our inner cities. We're going to fix.\par \par \uc2 Remember this, remember this, just remember this, so important. For years, the Democrats have controlled the inner cities; some up to 100 years; some over 100 years; unbroken. I say to the African American community and to the Hispanic community: What the hell do you have to lose? I will fix it. We will make them good. We'll make them safe. We'll bring back jobs. We'll create good, good schools and education.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I will fix it. We will fix our inner cities. \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 's been lying about the inner cities for years. She's not going to do anything. Frankly, you want to know the truth? She doesn't have the energy to do anything.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 She doesn't have the energy. I'm going to fight for every citizen of every background from every stretch of this nation. I'm going to fight for every person in this country who believes government should serve the people, not the donors and not the special interests.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 I'm going to fight to bring us all together as Americans. Just imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as one people, under one God, saluting one American flag.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Once again, we will have -- right -- once again, we will have a government of, by and for the people.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Of, by and for the people.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Folks, folks, we want to end Obamacare, we want to go to a plan that's so much better and so much less expensive, right? We want to have borders and we want people to come into our country. We welcome people, but they have to come in through a legal process. So, we're going to have a wall, but it's going to have a big, beautiful door and people are going to come into our country, but they're going to come in legally.\par \par \uc2 And by the way, just in case there's any question, yes, Mexico will pay for the wall 100 percent.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Think about, when you get in the voting booth, the \uc2 United States Supreme Court\uc2 . Just think about it because, I'll tell you what, you put the wrong justices on the Supreme Court and this country will never ever be the same. It will never be what you had hoped it would be, so just think about the \uc2 United States Supreme Court\uc2 . And we're going to bring -- so importantly, I got into this because of the border and the terror, but because of the border and because of trade.\par \par \uc2 And the trade is so easy for me. It's so obvious what's happening when our companies are flocking out. We're going to fix our trade, we're going to bring jobs back to our country, including this area, right here, which has been devastated.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Together, if we win on November 8th, and I really believe we will, we better.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 We will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America safe again and we will make America great again.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Thank you very much. God bless you. Go out and vote. God bless you.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020161027ecar0028m\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 CHARLOTTE \u8212\'20\'14 \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  on Wednesday pledged what he called a "new deal for black America" as he attempted to make late inroads with a voting bloc that polling shows favors Democrat \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  by a vast margin.\par \par \uc2 "I will be your greatest champion," Trump said during an campaign rally here. "I will never ever take the African American community for granted. Never, ever."\par \par \uc2 In a scripted speech heavy on policy specifics, the Republican presidential nominee laid out a plan that he said is built on setting up better schools, lowering crime in inner cities and creating more high-paying jobs.\par \par \uc2 He told the largely white audience that "massive numbers" of black Americans have been ignored and left behind, and he blamed Democrats and Clinton for the "crippling crime and total violence" in the nation's inner cities.\par \par \uc2 Trump was speaking in a city that was rocked by protests last month after police killed an unarmed black man. In his speech, he accused Clinton of waging a "war on police" that he said puts black lives at risk, and he called for police and residents to work together.\par \par \uc2 The GOP nominee pledged to remove gang members from inner cities and continued to falsely assert that the national murder rate is the highest it has been in 45 years.\par \par \uc2 "Some of our inner cities are more dangerous than the war zones we're reading about and seeing about every night," Trump said.\par \par \uc2 The real estate mogul said he wants to allow cities and states to declare disaster areas in blighted communities and give microloans to black entrepreneurs to help spur jobs. He championed school choice, which he called the "great civil rights issue of our time," and increased funding for historically black colleges and universities.\par \par \uc2 He proposed tax holidays for inner-city investment and incentives for foreign companies to invest in "blighted American neighborhoods," though Trump did not say what they were.\par \par \uc2 Trump later campaigned in Kinston, N.C., rallying an overwhelmingly white audience in a city that is about 68 percent black.\par \par \uc2 Trump's candidacy is barely registering with African American voters. He had 3 percent support among African Americans in an ABC News tracking poll released Sunday, compared with Clinton's 82 percent. Romney had 6 percent support among African Americans in 2012.\par \par \uc2 Toward the end of his speech, Trump also took a shot at a long-vanquished Republican rival as he slammed Clinton.\par \par \uc2 "She has less energy than Jeb Bush," Trump said, saying he had brought up Bush because he didn't live up to his pledge to support the eventual Republican nominee.\par \par \uc2 During the primary, Trump had disparagingly called Bush "low energy." A Bush spokeswoman said Trump continues to be fixated on the former Florida governor.\par \par \uc2 "\uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 's unending obsession with Governor Bush is very sad. \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  should be focused on his current race \u8212\'20\'14 he certainly needs all the help he can get," Kristy Campbell said in an email.\par \par \uc2 Earlier in the day, Trump made a detour to Washington to officially christen a downtown hotel bearing his name, even as his campaign sets its sights on Florida as its make-or-break battleground state less than two weeks before Election Day.\par \par \uc2 Aides insisted it was a non-campaign event, but when Trump took the stage, he railed against bloated military hospital construction projects, blasted Obamacare price spikes and congratulated former House speaker \uc2 Newt Gingrich\uc2  for sparring Tuesday night with Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly in a contentious prime-time interview.\par \par \uc2 "That was an amazing interview," Trump said as he pointed at Gingrich, sitting in the front of the room. "We don't play games, Newt, right? We don't play games."\par \par \uc2 Gingrich and Kelly had tussled over whether news coverage of sexual assault allegations against Trump compares fairly with stories about the ongoing release of hacked emails from top aides to Clinton.\par \par \uc2 Clinton marked her 69th birthday by making campaign stops in Florida. Her campaign also released two new television commercials it described as "closing arguments" to viewers in several battleground states.\par \par \uc2 Speaking to reporters aboard her campaign plane, where staffers surprised her with a chocolate birthday cake, Clinton expressed worry about creeping complacency among Democratic voters.\par \par \uc2 "We're not taking anything for granted," she said. "I feel good, but I am really determined that nobody is going to rest or stop or in any way think this election is over before it's actually over."\par \par \uc2 The Democratic nominee said Trump is "paying more attention to his business than to the campaign" by stopping at his Washington hotel.\par \par \uc2 Trump stood on a ballroom stage alongside three of his children at what was billed as the official grand opening of Trump International Hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue, just blocks from the White House. Trump's co-mingling of his business interests and presidential aspirations were on clear display in and around the glitzy ballroom where he spoke.\par \par \uc2 It was one of many instances in which he has simultaneously promoted his business and political interests. The last time Trump held a major public event at his hotel in the District was last month, when he acknowledged for the first time that President Obama was born in the United States.\par \par \uc2 He has also met privately there with hotel employees and used it for interviews and meetings with his foreign policy team.\par \par \uc2 On Tuesday, Trump staged a photo op with employees of his Trump National Doral golf resort near Miami and sought to speak about both campaign themes and his company. He raised money at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach on Monday.\par \par \uc2 Over the summer, after he effectively clinched the GOP nomination, Trump flew to Scotland to promote his golf courses there. He announced his campaign last year in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York. He even put Trump-branded products on display at an event in March.\par \par \uc2 Trump's reference to Gingrich's Fox interview came after one of his top campaign aides made an apparent threat against Kelly via \uc2 Twitter\uc2  on Tuesday night.\par \par \uc2 Dan Scavino tweeted that Kelly "made a total fool out of herself tonight \u8212\'20\'14 attacking @realDonaldTrump. Watch what happens to her after this election is over."\par \par \uc2 When Gingrich raised objections in the interview to the level of coverage of the hacking of Clinton campaign emails, Kelly shot back: "That is worth covering. And we did."\par \par \uc2 Gingrich persisted: "I mean, you want to go back through the tapes of your show recently. You are fascinated with sex, and you don't care about public policy."\par \par \uc2 Gingrich dismissed the allegations against Trump during the interview but repeatedly referred to former president \uc2 Bill Clinton\uc2  as a "sexual predator" \u8212\'20\'14 citing allegations by several women against the 42nd president dating to the 1970s. Gingrich led Republican congressional investigations of \uc2 Bill Clinton\uc2  in the 1990s that resulted in his impeachment. But the Clinton inquests also brought subsequent GOP congressional losses that forced Gingrich to step down as speaker.\par \par \uc2 Trump said again on Wednesday that he will put $100 million of his own money in the campaign, adding that he is willing "to spend much more than that."\par \par \uc2 "I'll have over $100 million in the campaign," he told \uc2 CNN\uc2 . "\uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  has nothing in the campaign. She's all special interests and donors, and they give her the money and then she will do whatever they tell her to do. But I will have over $100 million in the campaign, and I am prepared to go much more than that."\par \par \uc2 However, the real estate mogul has put only $56 million in so far, according to \uc2 Federal Election Commission\uc2  filings.\par \par \uc2 Campaigning in Lake Worth, Fla., Clinton acknowledged the opening of Trump's new hotel by noting that she was traveling Wednesday with Jos\u233\'00\'E9 Andr\u233\'00\'E9s, the Washington-based celebrity chef who backed out of plans to build a restaurant at the site.\par \par \uc2 "While the hotel may be new, it's the same old story," Clinton told supporters. "He relied on undocumented workers to make his project cheaper. Most of the products in the rooms were made overseas, and he even sued to get his taxes lowered. We know he's used undocumented workers. And that's one of the things he's run his campaign on, about deporting undocumented workers."\par \par \uc2 At his rally in Kinston, Trump denied that he used undocumented workers to help build the hotel.\par \par \uc2 "I didn't hire one \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  to build Trump International hotel," he said.\par \par \uc2 Last year, some workers on the project quietly acknowledged to The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2  that they are in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 ed.okeefe@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 sean.sullivan@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020161026ecaq003ml\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 "Of course there is large scale voter fraud happening on and before election day. Why do Republican leaders deny what is going on? So naive!"\par \par \uc2 --\uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 , post on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , Oct. 17, 2016\par \par \uc2 "Go sit there with your friends [at polling places] and make sure it's on the up and up. Because you know what, that's a big, big problem in this country and nobody wants to talk about it."\par \par \uc2 --Trump, campaign rally, Sept. 30, 2016\par \par \uc2 Trump has made several claims alleging a "rigged" election system. We looked at two of the Republican presidential nominee's\u160\'00\'A0claims: that there is widespread voter fraud, and that undocumented immigrants are voting and swaying elections. We'll rate the two separately, starting with the first claim.\par \par \uc2 The Facts\par \par \uc2 The Trump campaign pointed to a 2012 Pew Center on the States study of ways to make the election system more accurate, cost-effective and efficient. At an Oct. 17 rally, Trump cited the three main findings of the speech to back up his claim that voter fraud is common across the country:\par \par \uc2 * About 24 million (1\u160\'00\'A0in\u160\'00\'A0every 8) voter registrations were significantly inaccurate or no longer valid because people moved, had died or were inactive voters.\par \par \uc2 * More than 1.8 million records for people who are deceased, but whose registrations were still on voter rolls.\par \par \uc2 * About 2.75 million people were registered to vote in more than one state. This could happen if voters move to a new state and register to vote without notifying their former state.\par \par \uc2 * Outdated technology, shrinking government budgets and paper-based registration systems contributed to inaccuracies and inefficiencies.\par \par \uc2 But the study does not say that these problems indicated signs of isolated or widespread voter fraud. Yet Trump used the 1.8 million figure to inaccurately claim at the rally: "More than 1.8 million deceased individuals right now are listed as voters. Oh, that's wonderful. Well, if they're going to vote for me, we'll think about it, right? But I have a feeling they're not going to vote for me. Of the 1.8 million, 1.8 million is voting for somebody else."\par \par \uc2 The\u160\'00\'A0campaign pointed to three instances of voting irregularities \u8212\'20\'14 in Pennsylvania, Colorado and Virginia.\u160\'00\'A0But they were isolated instances that do not amount to widespread voter fraud \u8212\'20\'14 and do not\u160\'00\'A0show they are as common as he says they are.\par \par \uc2 Trump's campaign then\u160\'00\'A0sent lists of nearly 300 instances of voting irregularities between 2004 and 2016. Some of the cases involved indictments and guilty pleas of actual voter fraud, where someone illegally mailed an early ballot or cast a ballot at a polling place to defraud the system.\par \par \uc2 But the lists also included unsupported allegations of fraud, investigations into potential fraud and reports of less nefarious activities, such as\u160\'00\'A0people voting incorrectly and voting machines malfunctioning.\par \par \uc2 Even if all 300 instances were confirmed cases of actual voter fraud, they\u160\'00\'A0would make up such a small portion of total ballots cast in that 12-year period that it would be preposterous to call voter fraud\u160\'00\'A0a widespread or a "big, big" problem.\par \par \uc2 More than 1 billion ballots were cast from 2000 through 2014. There were 31 incidents of specific, credible allegations of voter impersonation at the polls, according to research by Loyola Law School professor \uc2 Justin Levitt\uc2 , who has been tracking such data for years. So the problem that Trump is warning his voters to watch for at the polls \u8212\'20\'14 to make sure things are "on the up and up" -- happens at the rate of 31 out of 1 billion ballots cast.\par \par \uc2 Out of 2,068 allegations of fraud cases in 2000\u160\'00\'A0to\u160\'00\'A02012, there were guilty verdicts in 159 cases, according to an analysis by News21, a journalism project of the Carnegie-Knight Initiative on the Future of Journalism Education.\par \par \uc2 Coordinated voter fraud has happened, but on a much smaller scale. In 1994, a federal judge\u160\'00\'A0invalidated the results of a state Senate race. Democratic campaign workers forged absentee ballots, which ultimately tipped the election by 461 votes. Democrats on the three-member elected board of elections intentionally failed to enforce the election law, even though they were aware of the fraud.\par \par \uc2 But it would be certainly nearly impossible to do something like that to tip a presidential election, our colleague Sari Horwitz found.\u160\'00\'A0We're talking about a nationwide effort of local, state and federal election officials colluding to commit a felony. Lawyers for both major parties and every poll watcher would have to be in on it.\par \par \uc2 A handful of people have tried to vote on behalf of dead people \u8212\'20\'14 usually their family member or spouse \u8212\'20\'14 but there is no evidence such voter rolls are being manipulated on a large scale. And there is no evidence of widespread voter fraud with people double voting.\par \par \uc2 The Pinocchio Test\par \par \uc2 Trump uses "voter fraud" has become a catchall phrase for all voting irregularities. Confirmed instances of actual voter fraud do exist, but Trump makes a totally unsupported extrapolation of\u160\'00\'A0these isolated cases to say they are indicative of a widespread fraud in the U.S. election system. We wonder whether\u160\'00\'A0it ever occurred to Trump that "nobody is talking about" the "big, big problem" of voter fraud because that "big, big" problem doesn't exist.\u160\'00\'A0Trump earns Four Pinocchios.\par \par \uc2 Four Pinocchios\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/87957f0e-edb5-4958-98ee-31e01d278e6b"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/87957f0e-edb5-4958-98ee-31e01d278e6b}}}\uc2  "Then there's the issue of illegal immigrants voting. The following comes from a 2014 report from The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2 : \u8230\'20\'26 'Non-citizen votes could have given Senate Democrats the pivotal 60th vote needed to overcome filibusters in order to pass health-care reform and many other reforms, and other Obama administration priorities.' Now, it continues: "It is 'possible that non-citizen votes were responsible for Obama's 2008 victory in North Carolina. Obama won the state' by 14,000 votes, so a turnout by 5.1 percent of North Carolina's adult citizens.'"\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 -- Trump, campaign rally, Oct. 17, 2016\par \par \uc2 Trump claims that illegal immigrants are voting in and tipping elections. During an Oct. 17 rally, Trump read excerpts from research that was published two years ago in the Monkey Cage, a blog hosted by The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2 . The campaign\u160\'00\'A0lists this research as the evidence for Trump's claims regarding \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  votes.\par \par \uc2 But Trump is incorrectly\u160\'00\'A0using the data, and does not note that there have been critiques of this research. Some critiques are now being incorporated into a revision of the original study.\par \par \uc2 Old Dominion University professors Jesse Richman and David Earnest studied voting participation rates of noncitizens by using data from 2008 and 2010 collected through the Cooperative Congressional Election Studies. This data set comes from a YouGov-Polimetrix opt-in Internet survey. Researchers were able to cross-check 40 percent of the data they collected from 2008.\par \par \uc2 In the October 2014 column, researchers shared their findings based on results from 339 noncitizen respondents in 2008 and 489 in 2010. Using these numbers, they found that 6.4 percent of noncitizens voted in 2008 and 2.2 percent of noncitizens voted in 2010. But the raw numbers are small: just 21 voters in 2008 and 8 voters in 2010.\par \par \uc2 Researchers then used these rates to extrapolate that the participation of noncitizens was "large enough to plausibly account for Democratic victories in a few close elections."\par \par \uc2 A number of researchers were skeptical of the findings and methodology, and they\u160\'00\'A0published critiques of it.\par \par \uc2 Stephen Ansolabehere, who creates and runs the Cooperative Congressional Election Study (used in the research by Richman and Earnest), and two other researchers offered the most thorough critique. They replicated the research by interviewing the same panel of respondents about their voting patterns in 2010 and 2012. They found that people had identified as a citizen one year, but noncitizen the next \u8212\'20\'14 indicating misclassification.\par \par \uc2 They concluded that all of the cases of noncitizen voting "are nearly certainly citizen voters who are misclassified as being non-citizens. Hence, their predicted vote rates of non-citizens in fact reflect the behavior of citizens." Because the citizen group is large compared with\u160\'00\'A0the noncitizen group in the survey, even a small classification error could be substantial, they found.\par \par \uc2 Ansolabehere responded to Trump's comments\u160\'00\'A0in\u160\'00\'A0an Oct. 19 Monkey Cage post, saying\u160\'00\'A0"there is absolutely no evidence from the data that non-citizens voted in recent presidential elections."\par \par \uc2 Richman said Ansolabehere's critique\u160\'00\'A0was thoughtful and useful, and that he is working on a revision based on the concerns\u160\'00\'A0raised in the response.\u160\'00\'A0But Richman said his results are valid and rejected claims that his findings were entirely spurious. There were 10 people who twice answered they were noncitizens but had voted in 2012, Richman said.\par \par \uc2 But Richman said that people like Trump who are using the study to make an unsupported claim of massive vote fraud are\u160\'00\'A0taking the findings out of context.\par \par \uc2 "One should keep in mind that such elections can be swayed by any number of factors that arguably bias election results toward, or against, particular parties and candidates," Richman said. "Put another way, our results suggest that almost all elections in the U.S. are not determined by non-citizen participation, with occasional and very rare potential exceptions."\par \par \uc2 [Update: During this speech, Trump also read a portion of the Monkey Cage article that\u160\'00\'A0"more than 14 percent of non-citizens in both 2008 and 2010 samples indicated that they were registered to vote." Then the point\u160\'00\'A0was misused by Eric Trump to say that 14 percent of all noncitizens were registered. We\u160\'00\'A0awarded the claim\u160\'00\'A0Four Pinocchios.]\par \par \uc2 The Pinocchio Test\par \par \uc2 As the researcher of the study notes, Trump's citing of these findings to back up his claim that illegal immigrants are voting and swaying elections is unfounded. Yet again, Trump takes isolated instances to extrapolate to a much larger trend, and earns Four Pinocchios.\par \par \uc2 Four Pinocchios\par \par \uc2 (About our rating scale)\par \par \uc2 Send us facts to check by filling out this form\par \par \uc2 Check out our guide to all Trump and Clinton fact checks\par \par \uc2 Sign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletter\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/8c00591f-faca-4668-a51e-29df01def32a"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/8c00591f-faca-4668-a51e-29df01def32a}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020161019ecaj003xq\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved \par \par \uc2 "Desierto" is a stark, economical thriller. Its conflict is elemental and the characters are defined with bold strokes. Director Jon\u224\'00\'E0\u161\'00\'A1s Cuar\u243\'00\'F3n, the son of acclaimed filmmaker Alfonso Cuar\u243\'00\'F3n, draws from the primal motives of "Gravity." (He wrote that screenplay with his father.) Instead of science fiction, however, this earthbound tale has a poignant political message - and not a subtle one.\par \par \uc2 A truck passes through the desert. In it, Moises (Gael Garc\u224\'00\'E0\u173\'00\'ADa Bernal) and about a dozen other men and women are trying to cross the border into the United States. The van breaks down, so they are forced to continue on foot. On the American side, Sam (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) hunts rabbits with his dog and a high-powered rifle. Illegal immigrants frustrate Sam - we know he reported tracks to the indifferent authorities - so when Sam spots the small band of border crossers, he takes matters into his own hands. He shoots them dead, one by one, but Moises and a few others escape.\par \par \uc2 The film is a sustained cat-and-mouse chase, with helpless innocents trying to avoid their inhumane pursuer. "Desierto" gives equal time to Moises and Sam, establishing just enough back story so we can understand who they are. Sam is not just a deplorable villain, but a broken man who uses his victims as an outlet for misguided rage. Moises is not just an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , but a thoughtful father whose empathy is constantly challenged. The chase is exhausting, almost as if the desert is a character in the film, and yet there are dialogue-driven moments in which the heroes and villain evolve from caricatures to people.\par \par \uc2 Cuar\u243\'00\'F3n's larger point - one that he pursues with every frame - is that border crossers deserve our sympathy. They have dreams, flaws and feelings. Sam only sees them from a distance. (There are many shots of him peering through the scope of his rifle.) The act of killing invigorates Sam: In a chilling scene, he laughs to himself after hitting his targets, shouting that this land is his. His entitlement is a contrast to the desperation of the victims, who seek only opportunity. All the actors, including Morgan, find nuance despite the simple, stripped-down requirements of the script by Cuar\u243\'00\'F3n and Mateo Garcia.\par \par \uc2 There are no surprises in "Desierto." Every interaction, no matter how brutal, plays out exactly as you might suspect. Moises proves himself resourceful, outsmarting Sam during a pivotal scene, and the final confrontation is more poignant than vengeful. But the utter lack of surprise is not a bad thing, exactly, since awaiting the inevitable is its own kind of breathless suspense. Even if a beautiful and impenetrable wall was built on the border, people like Moises - decent and frightened - would find a way here because, sometimes, the promise of a better life is worth it.\par \par \uc2 goingoutguide@washpost.com \par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com\par \par \uc2 WP20161014wk-f-desierto1014\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020161014ecae0001c\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Five members of the D.C.-area 18th Street gang have been acquitted on major drug charges in Alexandria federal court after defense attorneys argued their clients were lured into the scheme by federal agents.\par \par \uc2 Those agents, working for the \uc2 Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives\uc2 , staged an elaborate sham drug deal for the group's benefit. Posing as traffickers from Miami, earlier this year they flew a plane full of fake cocaine into a small airport in Northern Virginia. There, agents posing as drug runners picked up the sham cocaine, separated it into duffel bags and pretended to drive it north to New Jersey.\par \par \uc2 The agents offered the group $15,000 and a quarter of a kilogram of cocaine in exchange for picking up, storing and delivering 20 kilograms of the drug from their next flight.\par \par \uc2 Defense attorneys told the jury that if not for that offer, the five defendants would not have been involved in the drug trade at all. None of them have any known experience with illegal drugs.\par \par \uc2 "What we're dealing with are crimes of fiction," Dontae LaMont Bugg said during closing arguments.\par \par \uc2 Diego Escobar, Franklin Omar Avalos Munguia and Ever Ernesto Castill Arevalo were acquitted on all charges.\par \par \uc2 Two defendants were acquitted of the drug charges but convicted on other counts. Gerson Rodriguez Carranza was found guilty of possessing a firearm as an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .

All Rights Reserved \par \par \uc2 The man who would be in charge of guarding a wall with Mexico if Donald Trump is elected president isn't so sure the strategy would keep undocumented immigrants out.\par \par \uc2 Instead, Mark Morgan - the first outsider to lead the 21,000 uniformed agents who make up the U.S. Border Patrol - has had another priority in the three months he's been on the job: changing the agency's culture.\par \par \uc2 The force on the front lines of U.S. border security has faced allegations of an overly confrontational approach that's resulted in multiple fatal shootings, long unaddressed internal corruption and a lack of accountability in investigating misconduct.\par \par \uc2 Morgan has never arrested an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . But Customs and Border Protection Commissioner R. Gil Kerlikowske turned to him - overlooking others who came up through the ranks - to change course in what is, even by law enforcement standards, an insular culture.\par \par \uc2 "It was a culture of not getting out and talking about issues, not being transparent about the process that drove the perception there was a culture problem," Morgan, a career FBI official and former Los Angeles police officer, said in his first interview since his appointment in June.\par \par \uc2 Besides meeting with line agents at almost half of the 20 outposts that cover 6,000 miles along the Southwest and Canadian borders, Morgan, 51, has spent his first weeks in the job ensuring that new use-of-force policies in the training academy curriculum are encouraging recruits to turn to other strategies to defuse encounters that could get violent.\par \par \uc2 He's devising strategies to help agents develop better intelligence on the drug cartels and smugglers behind so many illegal crossings. He's coordinating multiple law enforcement authorities so that if agents do fire their weapons, there is a system to review whether the action was appropriate.\par \par \uc2 "The border patrol comes into contact with a lot more people than the \uc2 FBI\uc2 ," he said in his Washington office, dressed in the green Border Patrol uniform and black boots, his graying hair in a crew cut.\par \par \uc2 "The piece we need to get better at when a shooting happens is, what happens now?" he said. "I don't think we were very good at all about making decisions like whether the use of force was within our guidelines."\par \par \uc2 When it comes to enhancing border security, the wall the Republican presidential nominee has proposed to keep out illegal immigrants does not top Morgan's list, however hotly debated it has been. As a civil servant and not a political appointee, Morgan will be in the job whether Trump or \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  is elected.\par \par \uc2 "A simplistic answer to an immensely complex problem," is how Kerlikowske describes the wall. He notes that the government "spends a tremendous amount of money repairing what we have now" on the Southwest border - 600 miles of very intermittent fencing - from damage from erosion, flooding and holes when migrants break through.\par \par \uc2 "Does infrastructure play a role? Of course," Morgan said. "It's one element of a multifaceted approach. It isn't the answer."\par \par \uc2 He quipped, "I try not to be in the business of sound bites."\par \par \uc2 Morgan is, however, in the business of educating himself about the agents who patrol the border solo in scorching desert heat and frigid winters. He commutes an hour each way along Interstate 95 from his home in Stafford County, Va., where he spends most weekends poring over research and policy on training tactics, high-tech sensors and other border security strategies.\par \par \uc2 Morgan's varied \uc2 FBI\uc2  r\u233\'00\'E9sum\u233\'00\'E9 includes leading a Hispanic gang task force in Los Angeles and senior roles in Baghdad, New Haven, Conn., and El Paso. He was in charge of agency-wide training when Kerlikowske tapped him for the Border Patrol post, passing over several inside candidates.\par \par \uc2 Morgan was not new to border security. Two years ago, Kerlikowske brought him in to run the internal affairs office at the larger Customs and Border Protection agency after removing the longtime official in the job. That official was criticized for failing to investigate multiple allegations that Border Patrol agents had used excessive force on migrants.\par \par \uc2 A review in March by the Homeland Security Advisory Panel, an oversight board, criticized the system of discipline for abusive or corrupt Border Patrol agents as "deeply flawed."\par \par \uc2 Morgan is credited with bringing more accountability to these cases.\par \par \uc2 His appointment was criticized by the powerful Border Patrol union, which said an outsider could never gain agents' trust. Today, union spokesman Shawn Moran says agents "understand they're going to give the new chief a feeling-out period."\par \par \uc2 Moran said the public has "a lot of misconceptions that the Border Patrol is a trigger-happy organization rife with corruption."\par \par \uc2 Asked to describe the state of border security at a time when Trump supporters decry a massive lack of it, Morgan said, "Everybody has a different perspective on that." Some will say that the border is not secure unless you catch everyone who tries to cross illegally.\par \par \uc2 He acknowledges that it's hard to know how large this group is.\par \par \uc2 "How do you measure something you're preventing?" he said. "We're constantly trying to improve the way we measure this."\par \par \uc2 lisa.rein@washpost.com \par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com\par \par \uc2 WP20161003BORDER0930\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020161003eca30002c\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Local-Enterprise\par {\*\bkmkstart toc17}{\*\bkmkend toc17}\b \uc2 She fought to keep immigrants from being deported. Now she faces the same fate.\b0\par\par\uc2 By Michael E. Miller \par \uc2 2,317 \uc2 words\par \uc2 1 October 2016\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The guard searched the line of undocumented immigrants, placing each in shackles in the basement of a Homeland Security building in Northern Virginia. Then he came to a young woman in a blouse and blue pants that July day, and he paused.\par \par \uc2 "I know you," the guard told her, she remembered later. Months earlier, Wendy Uruchi Contreras had come to the same facility under much different circumstances \u8212\'20\'14 as an immigration rights activist.\par \par \uc2 That day, she had helped a Mexican woman bring her husband his belongings before he was deported. Uruchi and the guard had struck up a conversation, quickly realizing they lived near each other in Fredericksburg. Now she was on the other side of the plexiglass divide.\par \par \uc2 "What are you doing here?" the guard asked.\par \par \uc2 "I'm not a U.S. citizen," Uruchi answered. "And I got a DUI."\par \par \uc2 "I can't believe it," he said.\par \par \uc2 Uruchi's sudden fall \u8212\'20\'14 from immigrant advocate to undocumentedinmate \u8212\'20\'14 has stunned many who knew her. At Casa, the immigrants rights organization where Uruchi worked, colleagues were caught by surprise. Two weeks before pleading guilty to drunken driving, she had led a demonstration outside the Supreme Court urging the justices to support undocumented immigrants, but she never hinted she was one of them. She had spent threeyears helping others fight deportation. Now she faces that very fate.\par \par \uc2 Her arrest has exposed her husband's undocumented status and upended her children's lives. Any day now, Uruchi, 33, could be sent back to Spain. Under Obama administration guidelines, her DUI conviction makes her a priority for deportation. And under the visa waiver program she used to enter the country 14 years ago, she forfeited her right to legal appeal. Her only chance is a plea to Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials for a stay of deportation, citing her otherwise clean record, community service and two American-born kids.\par \par \uc2 "These stays are not commonly granted," said \uc2 Kim Propeack\uc2 , communications director for Casa, which is helping Uruchi. "And they are not granted without a fight."\par \par \uc2 Uruchi's case comes at a time of intense national debate over immigration, including what to do about mixed-status families like hers \u8212\'20\'14 parents who are in the country illegally but have children who are U.S. citizens. President Obama's efforts at immigration reform,which could have opened a pathway to legal status for Uruchi and her husband, have been repeatedly blocked by Congress and the courts. Republican presidential nominee \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 , meanwhile, has pledged to deport 11 million undocumented immigrants if elected, regardless of whether they have children born here.\par \par \uc2 Uruchi's situation isn't likely to generate much public sympathy. A recent CNN-ORC poll found that 83 percent of Americans favor deporting undocumented immigrants who have been convicted of a crime while living in the United States.\par \par \uc2 Uruchi knows she put everything at risk by getting into her car after drinking. "Driving that night," she acknowledged, "was the worst decision of my life."\par \par \uc2 In the Homeland Security complex many immigrants refer to as "Prosperity" after the avenue on which it sits in Fairfax, the guard waved a hand-held metal detector up and down Uruchi's body. Then the man she had once befriended put her in shackles and loaded her into a van bound for jail.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18Pray for me\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 Earlier this month, Uruchi's husband, Giovani Jimenez, stood in the doorway of their small house and tried to corral his children toward the car. It was a Sunday morning, and they were late to visit Wendy in jail in Williamsburg, 100 miles away.\par \par \uc2 "You're not taking anything?" Jimenez asked Alex, a quiet, gangly 13-year-old. Alex slunk inside and emerged with a thick library copy of "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince."\par \par \uc2 Lucia, a bubbly 7-year-old, clutched a stuffed panda in a pink dress and an iPad. She sat next to Alex in the back of the family's beige 1991 Honda Accord, its mismatched hood and Ron Jon Surf Shop window sticker vestiges of a previous owner.\par \par \uc2 Jimenez held a manila folder. Inside were printouts of the kids' grades, which had plummeted since Uruchi's May 28 arrest. Alex, an eighth-grader, was suddenly getting D's in English and algebra. He had begun to talk back to his father. Lucia, in second grade, was also struggling in math. She could only fall asleep while holding on to her father's wrist. She woke up most nights crying for her mother.\par \par \uc2 Jimenez, 37, was coping as well as he could. Along with the lawyer's fees and court fines, mortgage and car payments, there was the cost of a tank of gas for every Sunday visit, 15 cents per minute for every call from jail, $30 to print and mail photos of the kids' pool visits and birthday parties because the jail didn't allow Jimenez to email or hand them to Uruchi.\par \par \uc2 On Sunday night, after spending all day driving his children to see their mother, he would climb behind the wheel of a delivery truck and drive to New Jersey and Pennsylvania, hopefully returning home in time to welcome his kids from school on Monday.\par \par \uc2 His wife's arrest had been like a bomb landing in their precariously built lives. Jimenez had come to the United States in early 2001 from Bolivia. He met Uruchi online. She, too, was born in Bolivia but was raised in Madrid. She told him about her abusive stepfather in Spain. He told her to come to America. When they met at Dulles International Airport in October 2002, they had never even seen a photo of each other.\par \par \uc2 As a Spanish citizen, Uruchi entered the country under the United States' visa waiver program, which allows visitors from 38 countries to stay for up to 90 days without a visa.\par \par \uc2 She and Jimenez got married, had kids and settled in Virginia. He worked as a trucker; she cleaned hotel rooms. When her back began to hurt, she took food safety courses and managed the hotel's kitchen.\par \par \uc2 In 2013, Uruchi began to get involved in activism. Deportations had reached an all-time high of more than 409,000 the previous year. But Uruchi's adolescence in Spain, where she saw women say and do what they wanted, had left the 4-foot-11 immigrant unafraid of speaking out. After meeting Casa employees at an event at the Salvadoran Embassy in D.C., she began attending the group's events. Soon, she was organizing them. In 2014, she was hired full time as a Virginia community organizer.\par \par \uc2 "She was banging off the walls with excitement," said Propeack, her Casa co-worker. Propeack recalled Uruchi organizing a Jan. 14 event in Richmond. It was the middle of winter, but Uruchi persuaded several dozen people to show up to the state capitol to lobby for immigrants' rights. "Wendy got all these undocumented moms to come," Propeack recalled.\par \par \uc2 Uruchi also helped undocumented immigrants fight deportation. Liliana Mendez, a 26-year-old Salvadoran woman from Falls Church, was about to be deported after a traffic accident when she came to Casa for help. Uruchi organized a news conference with a congressman. Within days, Mendez's deportation was stayed, and her ankle monitor was removed. "Wendy helped me so much," Mendez said.\par \par \uc2 Uruchi's activism took a toll on her marriage, however. She would often come home at 9 or 10 at night, only to spend more time on the phone guiding immigrants through health care sign-ups or school applications. The couple was considering a divorce when Uruchi was arrested.\par \par \uc2 She had attended a Casa event in Woodbridge, then gone to a restaurant with a colleague for dinner. They drank margaritas and discussed Uruchi's marital problems. As Uruchi drove them back to Fredericksburg, a Stafford County sheriff's deputy pulled her over.\par \par \uc2 Uruchi was on the phone with Jimenez when she saw the flashing lights behind her. She knew an undocumented immigrant could be deported over something as small as a fender-bender.\par \par \uc2 "Pray for me," she told her husband and hung up.\par \par \uc2 Her blood alcohol level was twice the legal limit for driving of 0.08.\par \par \uc2 On July 8, Uruchi and her husband went to Stafford County court. Their DUI attorney had negotiated a deal with the prosecutor: just one day in jail if she pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor. Only then did they tell the attorney Uruchi was undocumented. They say he told them not to worry: Stafford wouldn't alert federal officials.\par \par \uc2 Jimenezsaid he begged his wife not to take the deal, telling her it would be better to challenge the Breathalyzer results in court. But Uruchi pleaded guilty.She wanted it to be over, she said. "I screwed up, and I needed to face it."\par \par \uc2 She prayed she would be released after a day. Instead, she was sent from Stafford to "Prosperity," where ICE officials asked about her husband. He, too, was undocumented, she admitted.\par \par \uc2 "They have all my information: Wendy gave it to them," Jimenez said. "They might come for me now."\par \par \uc2 After two days of questioning, ICE officials told Uruchi she would be deported. The Obama administration began more aggressively deporting illegal immigrants with DUI convictions after a string of deadly, high-profile incidents. One of the most notorious occurred in 2010 in Prince William County, when Carlos A. Martinelly Montano drunkenly hit another car head on, killing Sister Denise Mosier and injuring two other nuns. Montano, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Bolivia, had been arrested for drunken driving on two earlier occasions but released.\par \par \uc2 Corey A Stewart (R-At Large), chairman of Prince William's Board of County Supervisors, the head of Trump's Virginia campaign and a longtime critic of illegal immigration, said there was "no question" Uruchi should be deported.\par \par \uc2 "Otherwise, eventually, people tend to graduate in the severity of their crimes," he said, citing the 2010 case. Uruchi "shows how entitled illegal immigrants feel: Here is somebody who is so brazen that they're here illegally, and they are out there as a crusader trying to keep people from being deported."\par \par \uc2 Almost 24,000 undocumented immigrants from Virginia and the District have been deported over the past 10 years, ICE figures show.\par \par \uc2 Had Uruchi not pleaded guilty, she might have been able to admit to a lesser charge and avoid ICE altogether. Had she entered the country illegally, rather than on a visa waiver, she would have been entitled to a hearing in front of an immigration judge. And had she been an American citizen, her DUI would have cost her $300 and her license for a year.Instead, she is now filing an application for a stay of deportation.\par \par \uc2 "It's the one shot we have left," said her lawyer, Enid Gonzalez.\par \par \uc2 "She is a woman who [has been] fighting to stop deportation and now is in danger of getting deported herself," wrote Pamela Benavides-Barahona, 12, who said in a letter of support that Uruchi drove her to school events when her mother could not. "She never gives up and we should not give up on her."\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18I\u8217\'20\'19ll be home soon\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 "Hello," Jimenez said in English to the woman behind the desk at the Virginia Peninsula Regional Jail in Williamsburg. "I'm here to see Wendy Uruchi."\par \par \uc2 "I thought I recognized you," the woman said.\par \par \uc2 As his father signed in, Alex paced back and forth in the lobby. Eventually, the woman at the desk directed them to visitation room 111.\par \par \uc2 On either side of a large plexiglass window sat a metal stool. The door opened. Lucia gasped.\par \par \uc2 "Mama," she said, jumping onto the table, putting her small hand to the window and wiggling her fingers. Dressed in a dark blue jumpsuit, Uruchi put her own hand to the glass, revealing broken nails.\par \par \uc2 "Como est\u225\'00\'E1s?" she asked Alex.\par \par \uc2 "Soy bien," he said into a metal speaker, botching his Spanish. While his younger sister is fluent, Alex has lost much of the language, leading his parents to worry how he will adapt if Uruchi is deported and the family has to follow her to Spain.\par \par \uc2 "You look chubby," Uruchi told her daughter with a smile. Lucia, dressed in a sparkly new school outfit, now wore size 10, Jimenez said.\par \par \uc2 Had they been brushing their teeth, taking their vitamins, doing their homework, Uruchi asked. Had they been to the pool?\par \par \uc2 "It's closed," Jimenez said.\par \par \uc2 "I guess it's not summer any longer," she replied.\par \par \uc2 She asked them what books they had been reading, scolding Lucia when Jimenez reported she had been playing games on the iPad instead. From time to time, Uruchi would say something to Alex in Spanish that he didn't understand.\par \par \uc2 "I feel like there is a fly stuck inside my head," he said after one misunderstanding.\par \par \uc2 "You're my son," Uruchi told him. "You are strong, Alex. This won't last. I won't be here forever. One of these days, I'll come home."\par \par \uc2 "Are you going to be in here for all of second grade?" Lucia asked. "And third grade?"\par \par \uc2 "No, mi amor," Uruchi said. "I'll be home soon."\par \par \uc2 She told Alex she was sorry she had missed his birthday, three days earlier.\par \par \uc2 "When I get out, we'll celebrate it," she said.\par \par \uc2 "No, it's better if we don't," he replied.\par \par \uc2 A female jailer opened the door behind Uruchi, signaling the end of the visit.\par \par \uc2 "Keep your head up, Alex," Uruchi told her son as he walked out of the small room.\par \par \uc2 Lucia ran back to the plexiglass. Mother and daughter kissed the window at the same time. Then Uruchi was led away.\par \par \uc2 michael.miller@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 Emily Guskin and Jennifer Jenkins contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020160929ec9t005bs\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

Miller \par \uc2 2,316 \uc2 words\par \uc2 30 September 2016\par \uc2 The Washington Post\par \uc2 WP\par \uc2 FINAL\par A01\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved \par \par \uc2 The guard searched the line of undocumented immigrants, placing each in shackles in the basement of a Homeland Security building in Northern Virginia. Then he came to a young woman in a blouse and blue pants that July day, and he paused.\par \par \uc2 "I know you," the guard told her, she remembered later. Months earlier, Wendy Uruchi Contreras had come to the same facility under much different circumstances - as an immigration rights activist.\par \par \uc2 That day, she had helped a Mexican woman bring her husband his belongings before he was deported. Uruchi and the guard had struck up a conversation, quickly realizing they lived near each other in Fredericksburg. Now she was on the other side of the plexiglass divide.\par \par \uc2 "What are you doing here?" the guard asked.\par \par \uc2 "I'm not a U.S. citizen," Uruchi answered. "And I got a DUI."\par \par \uc2 "I can't believe it," he said.\par \par \uc2 Uruchi's sudden fall - from immigrant advocate to undocumented inmate - has stunned many who knew her. At Casa, the immigrants rights organization where Uruchi worked, colleagues were caught by surprise. Two weeks before pleading guilty to drunken driving, she had led a demonstration outside the Supreme Court urging the justices to support undocumented immigrants, but she never hinted she was one of them. She had spent three years helping others fight deportation. Now she faces that very fate.\par \par \uc2 Her arrest has exposed her husband's undocumented status and upended her children's lives. Any day now, Uruchi, 33, could be sent back to Spain. Under Obama administration guidelines, her DUI conviction makes her a priority for deportation. And under the visa waiver program she used to enter the country 14 years ago, she forfeited her right to legal appeal. Her only chance is a plea to Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials for a stay of deportation, citing her otherwise clean record, community service and two American-born kids.\par \par \uc2 "These stays are not commonly granted," said \uc2 Kim Propeack\uc2 , communications director for Casa, which is helping Uruchi. "And they are not granted without a fight."\par \par \uc2 Uruchi's case comes at a time of intense national debate over immigration, including what to do about mixed-status families like hers - parents who are in the country illegally but have children who are U.S. citizens. President Obama's efforts at immigration reform, which could have opened a pathway to legal status for Uruchi and her husband, have been repeatedly blocked by Congress and the courts. Republican presidential nominee \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 , meanwhile, has pledged to deport 11 million undocumented immigrants if elected, regardless of whether they have children born here.\par \par \uc2 Uruchi's situation isn't likely to generate much public sympathy. A recent CNN-ORC poll found that 83 percent of Americans favor deporting undocumented immigrants who have been convicted of a crime while living in the United States.\par \par \uc2 Uruchi knows she put everything at risk by getting into her car after drinking. "Driving that night," she acknowledged, "was the worst decision of my life."\par \par \uc2 In the Homeland Security complex many immigrants refer to as "Prosperity," after the avenue on which it sits in Fairfax, the guard waved a handheld metal detector up and down Uruchi's body. Then the man she had once befriended put her in shackles and loaded her into a van bound for jail.\par \par \uc2 'Pray for me'\par \par \uc2 Earlier this month, Uruchi's husband, Giovani Jimenez, stood in the doorway of their small house and tried to corral his children toward the car. It was a Sunday morning, and they were late to visit Wendy in jail in Williamsburg, 100 miles away.\par \par \uc2 "You're not taking anything?" Jimenez asked Alex, a quiet, gangly 13-year-old. Alex slunk inside and emerged with a thick library copy of "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince."\par \par \uc2 Lucia, a bubbly 7-year-old, clutched an iPad and a stuffed panda in a pink dress. She sat next to Alex in the back of the family's beige 1991 Honda Accord, its mismatched hood and Ron Jon Surf Shop window sticker vestiges of a previous owner.\par \par \uc2 Jimenez held a manila folder. Inside were printouts of the kids' grades, which had plummeted since Uruchi's May 28 arrest. Alex, an eighth-grader, was suddenly getting D's in English and algebra. He had begun to talk back to his father. Lucia, in second grade, was also struggling in math. She could only fall asleep while holding on to her father's wrist. She woke up most nights crying for her mother.\par \par \uc2 Jimenez, 37, was coping as well as he could. Along with the lawyer's fees and court fines, mortgage and car payments, there was the cost of a tank of gas for every Sunday visit, 15 cents per minute for every call from jail, $30 to print and mail photos of the kids' pool visits and birthday parties because the jail didn't allow Jimenez to email or hand them to Uruchi.\par \par \uc2 On Sunday night, after spending all day driving his children to see their mother, he would climb behind the wheel of a delivery truck and drive to New Jersey and Pennsylvania, hopefully returning home in time to welcome his kids from school on Monday.\par \par \uc2 His wife's arrest had been like a bomb landing in their precariously built lives. Jimenez had come to the United States in early 2001 from Bolivia. He met Uruchi online. She, too, was born in Bolivia but was raised in Madrid. She told him about her abusive stepfather in Spain. He told her to come to America. When they met at Dulles International Airport in October 2002, they had never even seen a photo of each other.\par \par \uc2 As a Spanish citizen, Uruchi entered the country under the United States' visa waiver program, which allows visitors from 38 countries to stay for up to 90days without a visa.\par \par \uc2 She and Jimenez got married, had kids and settled in Virginia. He worked as a trucker; she cleaned hotel rooms. When her back began to hurt, she took food safety courses and managed the hotel's kitchen.\par \par \uc2 In 2013, Uruchi began to get involved in activism. Deportations had reached an all-time high of more than 409,000 the previous year. But Uruchi's adolescence in Spain, where she saw women say and do what they wanted, had left the 4-foot-11 immigrant unafraid of speaking out. After meeting Casa employees at an event at the Salvadoran Embassy in D.C., she began attending the group's events. Soon, she was organizing them. In 2014, she was hired full time as a Virginia community organizer.\par \par \uc2 "She was banging off the walls with excitement," said Propeack, her Casa co-worker. Propeack recalled Uruchi organizing a Jan. 14 event in Richmond. It was the middle of winter, but Uruchi persuaded several dozen people to show up to the state capitol to lobby for immigrants' rights. "Wendy got all these undocumented moms to come," Propeack recalled.\par \par \uc2 Uruchi also helped undocumented immigrants fight deportation. Liliana Mendez, a 26-year-old Salvadoran woman from Falls Church, was about to be deported after a traffic accident when she came to Casa for help. Uruchi organized a news conference with a congressman. Within days, Mendez's deportation was stayed, and her ankle monitor was removed. "Wendy helped me so much," Mendez said.\par \par \uc2 Uruchi's activism took a toll on her marriage, however. She would often come home at 9 or 10 at night, only to spend more time on the phone guiding immigrants through health care sign-ups or school applications. The couple was considering a divorce when Uruchi was arrested.\par \par \uc2 She had attended a Casa event in Woodbridge, then gone to a restaurant with a colleague for dinner. They drank margaritas and discussed Uruchi's marital problems. As Uruchi drove them back to Fredericksburg, a Stafford County sheriff's deputy pulled her over.\par \par \uc2 Uruchi was on the phone with Jimenez when she saw the flashing lights behind her. She knew an undocumented immigrant could be deported over something as small as a fender-bender.\par \par \uc2 "Pray for me," she told her husband before hanging up.\par \par \uc2 Her blood alcohol level was twice the legal limit for driving of 0.08.\par \par \uc2 On July 8, Uruchi and her husband went to Stafford County court. Their DUI attorney had negotiated a deal with the prosecutor: just one day in jail if she pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor. Only then did they tell the attorney Uruchi was undocumented. They say he told them not to worry: Stafford wouldn't alert federal officials.\par \par \uc2 Jimenez said he begged his wife not to take the deal, telling her it would be better to challenge the Breathalyzer results in court. But Uruchi pleaded guilty. She wanted it to be over, she said. "I screwed up, and I needed to face it."\par \par \uc2 She prayed she would be released after a day. Instead, she was sent from Stafford to "Prosperity," where ICE officials asked about her husband. He, too, was undocumented, she admitted.\par \par \uc2 "They have all my information: Wendy gave it to them," Jimenez said. "They might come for me now."\par \par \uc2 After two days of questioning, ICE officials told Uruchi she would be deported. The Obama administration began more aggressively deporting illegal immigrants with DUI convictions after a string of deadly, high-profile incidents. One of the most notorious occurred in 2010 in Prince William County, when Carlos A. Martinelly Montano drunkenly hit another car head on, killing Sister Denise Mosier and injuring two other nuns. Montano, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Bolivia, had been arrested for drunken driving on two earlier occasions but released.\par \par \uc2 Corey A. Stewart (R-At Large), chairman of Prince William's Board of County Supervisors, the head of Trump's Virginia campaign and a longtime critic of illegal immigration, said there was "no question" Uruchi should be deported.\par \par \uc2 "Otherwise, eventually, people tend to graduate in the severity of their crimes," he said, citing the 2010 case. Uruchi "shows how entitled illegal immigrants feel: Here is somebody who is so brazen that they're here illegally, and they are out there as a crusader trying to keep people from being deported."\par \par \uc2 Almost 24,000 undocumented immigrants from Virginia and the District have been deported over the past 10 years, ICE figures show.\par \par \uc2 Had Uruchi not pleaded guilty, she might have been able to admit to a lesser charge and avoid ICE altogether. Had she entered the country illegally, rather than on a visa waiver, she would have been entitled to a hearing in front of an immigration judge. And had she been an American citizen, her DUI would have cost her $300 and her license for a year. Instead, she is now filing an application for a stay of deportation.\par \par \uc2 "It's the one shot we have left," said her lawyer, Enid Gonzalez.\par \par \uc2 "She is a woman who [has been] fighting to stop deportation and now is in danger of getting deported herself," wrote Pamela Benavides-Barahona, 12, who said in a letter of support that Uruchi drove her to school events when her mother could not. "She never gives up and we should not give up on her."\par \par \uc2 'I'll be home soon'\par \par \uc2 "Hello," Jimenez said in English to the woman behind the desk at the Virginia Peninsula Regional Jail in Williamsburg. "I'm here to see Wendy Uruchi."\par \par \uc2 "I thought I recognized you," the woman said.\par \par \uc2 As his father signed in, Alex paced back and forth in the lobby. Eventually, the woman at the desk directed them to visitation room 111.\par \par \uc2 On either side of a large plexiglass window sat a metal stool. The door opened. Lucia gasped.\par \par \uc2 "Mama," she said, jumping onto the table, putting her small hand to the window and wiggling her fingers. Dressed in a dark blue jumpsuit, Uruchi put her own hand to the glass, revealing broken nails.\par \par \uc2 "Como est\u224\'00\'E0\u161\'00\'A1s?" she asked Alex.\par \par \uc2 "Soy bien," he said into a metal speaker, botching his Spanish. While his younger sister is fluent, Alex has lost much of the language, leading his parents to worry how he will adapt if Uruchi is deported and the family has to follow her to Spain.\par \par \uc2 "You look chubby," Uruchi told her daughter with a smile. Lucia, dressed in a sparkly new school outfit, now wore size 10, Jimenez said.\par \par \uc2 Had they been brushing their teeth, taking their vitamins, doing their homework, Uruchi asked. Had they been to the pool?\par \par \uc2 "It's closed," Jimenez said.\par \par \uc2 "I guess it's not summer any longer," she replied.\par \par \uc2 She asked them what books they had been reading, scolding Lucia when Jimenez reported she had been playing games on the iPad instead. From time to time, Uruchi would say something to Alex in Spanish that he didn't understand.\par \par \uc2 "I feel like there is a fly stuck inside my head," he said after one misunderstanding.\par \par \uc2 "You're my son," Uruchi told him. "You are strong, Alex. This won't last. I won't be here forever. One of these days, I'll come home."\par \par \uc2 "Are you going to be in here for all of second grade?" Lucia asked. "And third grade?"\par \par \uc2 "No, mi amor," Uruchi said. "I'll be home soon."\par \par \uc2 She told Alex she was sorry she had missed his birthday, three days earlier.\par \par \uc2 "When I get out, we'll celebrate it," she said.\par \par \uc2 "No, it's better if we don't," he replied.\par \par \uc2 A female jailer opened the door behind Uruchi, signaling the end of the visit.\par \par \uc2 "Keep your head up, Alex," Uruchi told her son as he walked out of the small room.\par \par \uc2 Lucia ran back to the plexiglass. Mother and daughter kissed the window at the same time. Then Uruchi was led away.\par \par \uc2 michael.miller@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 Emily Guskin and Jennifer Jenkins contributed to this report. \par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com\par \par \uc2 WP20160930DEPORTATION\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020160930ec9u00022\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The man who would be in charge of guarding a wall with Mexico if \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  is elected president isn't so sure the strategy would keep\u160\'00\'A0undocumented immigrants out.\par \par \uc2 Instead, Mark Morgan \u8212\'20\'14 \u160\'00\'A0the first outsider to lead the 21,ooo uniformed agents\u160\'00\'A0who make up the\u160\'00\'A0U.S. Border Patrol \u8212\'20\'14 has had another priority in the three\u160\'00\'A0months he's been on the job: changing the agency's culture.\par \par \uc2 The law enforcement\u160\'00\'A0force on the front lines of U.S. border security has faced allegations of an overly confrontational approach that's resulted in multiple fatal shootings, long unaddressed internal corruption and a lack of accountability in investigating misconduct.\par \par \uc2 Morgan has never arrested an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . But Customs and Border Protection Commissioner R. Gil Kerlikowske turned to him -- overlooking others who came up through the ranks -- to change course in what is, even by law enforcement standards, an insular culture.\par \par \uc2 "It was a culture of not getting out and talking about issues, not being transparent about the process that drove the perception there was a culture problem," Morgan, a career FBI official and former Los Angeles police officer, said in his first interview since his appointment in June.\par \par \uc2 Besides meeting with line agents at almost half of the 20\u160\'00\'A0outposts that\u160\'00\'A0cover 6,000 miles along the Southwest and Canadian borders,\u160\'00\'A0Morgan, 51, has\u160\'00\'A0spent his first weeks in the job ensuring that new use-of-force policies in the\u160\'00\'A0training\u160\'00\'A0academy curriculum are encouraging recruits to turn to other strategies to defuse encounters that could get violent.\par \par \uc2 He's devising strategies to help agents develop better intelligence on the\u160\'00\'A0drug cartels and smugglers behind so many illegal crossings. He's coordinating multiple law enforcement authorities so that if agents do fire their weapons, there is a system to review whether the action was appropriate.\par \par \uc2 "The border patrol\u160\'00\'A0comes into contact with a lot more people than the \uc2 FBI\uc2 ," he\u160\'00\'A0said in his Washington office, dressed in the green Border Patrol uniform\u160\'00\'A0and black boots, his graying hair in a crew cut.\par \par \uc2 "The piece we need to get better at when a shooting happens is, what happens now?" he said. "I don't think we were very good at all about making decisions like whether the use of force was within our guidelines."\par \par \uc2 When it comes to enhancing border security, the wall\u160\'00\'A0the Republican nominee for president has proposed to keep out illegal immigrants\u160\'00\'A0does not top Morgan's list, however hotly debated it has been. As a civil servant\u160\'00\'A0and not\u160\'00\'A0a political appointee, Morgan will be in the job whether Trump or \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  is elected.\par \par \uc2 "A simplistic answer to an immensely complex problem," is how\u160\'00\'A0Kerlikowske describes the wall. He notes that the government "spends a tremendous amount of money repairing what we have now" on the Southwest border \u8212\'20\'14 600 miles of very intermittent fencing \u8212\'20\'14\u160\'00\'A0from damage from erosion, flooding and holes when migrants break through.\par \par \uc2 "Does infrastructure play a role? Of course," Morgan said. "It's one element of a multifaceted approach. It isn't the answer."\par \par \uc2 He quipped,\u160\'00\'A0"I try not to be in the business of sound bites."\par \par \uc2 Morgan is, however, in the business of educating himself about the agents who patrol the border solo in scorching desert heat and frigid winters. He commutes an hour each way along Interstate 95 from his home in Stafford County, Va., where he spends most weekends poring over research and policy\u160\'00\'A0on training tactics, high-tech sensors and other border security strategies.\par \par \uc2 In his (limited) spare time, he remodels and putters, two hobbies he says he's "pretty good at." His reading list skews heavily toward books on leadership. He says they've taught him that "you don't need to have a title to be a leader who makes an impact."\par \par \uc2 Morgan's\u160\'00\'A0varied \uc2 FBI\uc2  resume includes leading a\u160\'00\'A0Hispanic gang task force in Los Angeles and\u160\'00\'A0senior roles in Baghdad, New Haven, Conn., and El Paso. He was in charge of\u160\'00\'A0agency-wide\u160\'00\'A0training when Kerlikowske tapped him for the Border Patrol post, passing over several inside candidates.\par \par \uc2 Morgan was not entirely new to border security. Two years ago,\u160\'00\'A0Kerlikowske brought him in to run the internal affairs office at the larger Customs and Border Protection agency after removing the longtime official in the job. That official was criticized for failing to investigate multiple allegations that Border Patrol agents had used excessive force on migrants.\par \par \uc2 An review in March by the Homeland Security Advisory Panel, an oversight board, criticized the system of\u160\'00\'A0discipline for abusive or corrupt Border Patrol agents as\u160\'00\'A0"deeply flawed."\par \par \uc2 Morgan is credited with bringing more accountability to these cases.\par \par \uc2 His appointment was criticized by the powerful Border Patrol union, which said an outsider could never gain agents' trust. Today union spokesman Shawn Moran says agents "understand they're going to give the new chief a feeling-out period."\par \par \uc2 Moran said the public has "a lot of misconceptions that the Border Patrol is a trigger-happy organization rife with corruption."\par \par \uc2 Kerlikowske said the problems stem from a "huge amount of growth" in the force since the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, along with increasingly aggressive drug cartels and smuggling operations. "Now it's not uncommon to see people carrying guns," he said.\par \par \uc2 Asked to describe the state of border security at a time when Trump supporters decry a massive lack of it, Morgan said, "Everybody has a different perspective on that." Some will say, of course, that the border is not secure unless you catch\u160\'00\'A0everyone who tries to cross illegally.\par \par \uc2 He acknowledges that it's very hard to\u160\'00\'A0know how large this group is.\par \par \uc2 "How do you measure something you're preventing?" he asks. "We're constantly trying to improve the way we measure this."\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020160928ec9s002h1\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 the-fix\par {\*\bkmkstart toc20}{\*\bkmkend toc20}\b \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  loves him some big government \b0\par\par\uc2 By Aaron Blake \par \uc2 767 \uc2 words\par \uc2 23 September 2016\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The greatest trick \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  has played during the 2016 campaign might be getting the Republican Party to\u160\'00\'A0nominate\u160\'00\'A0a lover of big government.\par \par \uc2 As Trump continues to roll out his policy proposals, he keeps wading into the kind of anti-free market, activist government territory that Republicans usually avoid like the plague.\par \par \uc2 While \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  is\u160\'00\'A0talking about making public colleges tuition free, Trump made\u160\'00\'A0his own counterproposal Thursday night: Force colleges to make tuition cheaper ... by threatening them.\u160\'00\'A0Trump said\u160\'00\'A0he would withhold tax breaks from colleges who don't use their endowments to reduce the cost of tuition.\par \par \uc2 "Instead these universities use the money to pay their administrators, to put donors names on their buildings, or just store the money, keep it and invest it," he said. "In fact, many\u160\'00\'A0universities spend more on private-equity fund managers than on tuition\u160\'00\'A0programs. But they should be using the money on students, for tuition, for student life and for student housing. That's what it's supposed to be for."\par \par \uc2 Similarly, a couple weeks ago, Trump unveiled his plan to mandate six weeks of paid maternity leave and lower the cost of child care by making it completely tax deductible \u8212\'20\'14\u160\'00\'A0up to the average annual cost of child care in that state.\par \par \uc2 Both are proposals that probably\u160\'00\'A0appeal to voters. But they're also both\u160\'00\'A0counter to long-standing Republican Party orthodoxy, which holds that the free market is the best arbiter of such things and that the role and size of government should rarely be expanded. These kinds of proposals\u160\'00\'A0are often dismissed by the GOP as government handouts and intrusions\u160\'00\'A0on\u160\'00\'A0the free market.\par \par \uc2 It was only four years ago, you may recall, that Republican presidential nominee \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2 \u160\'00\'A0blamed his loss on President Obama and the Democrats\u160\'00\'A0offering "gifts" to their voters\u160\'00\'A0\u8212\'20\'14 especially minorities and young people.\u160\'00\'A0By this definition, Trump is also very much in the gift-giving business:\par \par \uc2 * He has called for a massive increase in defense spending that the Trump campaign has said would amount to as much as $500 billion over 10 years, by eliminating the sequester that forced spending cuts when Congress was unable to reach an agreement on a budget.\par \par \uc2 * Trump has said he wants to spend at least\u160\'00\'A0double the $275 billion over five years that\u160\'00\'A0Clinton has proposed spending on rebuilding the country's infrastructure \u8212\'20\'14\u160\'00\'A0roads, bridges, etc.\u160\'00\'A0"By the way, [\uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 's] numbers is a fraction of what we're talking about; we need much more money than that to rebuild our infrastructure," he told \uc2 Fox Business Network\uc2  in August. "I would say at least double her numbers, and you're going to really need more than that. We have bridges that are falling down." He even said in his last book that\u160\'00\'A0infrastructure requires "a trillion-dollar rebuilding program."\par \par \uc2 * He has said he would prevent the \uc2 Ford Motor Company\uc2  from building a plant in Mexico by threatening it with tariffs on anything produced there. "Let me give you the bad news: Every car, every truck and every part manufactured in this plant that comes across the border, we're going to charge you a 35 percent tax \u8212\'20\'14 okay? \u8212\'20\'14 and that tax is going to be paid simultaneously with the transaction," he said last year.\par \par \uc2 * Trump\u160\'00\'A0has said he thinks eminent domain \u8212\'20\'14\u160\'00\'A0government seizing private property and compensating people for it in the name of developing it \u8212\'20\'14\u160\'00\'A0is "wonderful."\par \par \uc2 * He has proposed massive increases in \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  enforcement that The Fix calculated would cost more than $50 billion over five years\u160\'00\'A0\u8212\'20\'14 potentially even doubling the amount spent on it.\par \par \uc2 * While Republicans have pushed for entitlement reforms to keep such programs as Social Security solvent, Trump has said he won't do it \u8212\'20\'14\u160\'00\'A0at all. "I will do everything within my power not to touch Social Security, to leave it the way it is," he has said. He has also said: "It's my intention to leave Social Security the way it is \u8212\'20\'14\u160\'00\'A0not increase the age and to leave it as is."\par \par \uc2 To be sure, Trump's positions on any of these issues are liable to change at any moment. He's also said, for example, that he would look at reforms to Social Security for future generations.\par \par \uc2 But it remains one of the more remarkable aspects of 2016\u160\'00\'A0that the nominee of a party that has so emphasized shrinking government in recent years is calling for a very activist role for American government. And Trump only seems to be getting started.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020160923ec9n004jy\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Disgraceful.\u160\'00\'A0"The White House worked behind the scenes last week to prevent a bipartisan bill to sanction the Assad regime for war crimes and atrocities against civilians from getting a vote in the House of Representatives. The Democratic leadership bowed to White House pressure and withdrew its support for voting on the bill for now."\par \par \uc2 Trump's idol \uc2 Vladimir Putin\uc2  acts in predictably deplorable ways: "U.S. intelligence agencies believe that Russian aircraft conducted the strike that targeted a humanitarian aid convoy in northern Syria on Monday, according to U.S. officials, challenging Russia's assertion that it wasn't behind the attack. [Secretary of State John F.] Kerry initially initially said Syrian forces were "evidently" responsible for the convoy attack, which killed at least 12 people. The U.S. officials said new intelligence indicates that Russian forces, rather than the Syrians, conducted the strike." Someone should ask Trump about this at the next debate.\par \par \uc2 Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.) understands how egregious this is: "According to the UN Humanitarian Affairs chief \uc2 Stephen O'Brien\uc2 , notification of the convoy \u8212\'20\'14 which planned to reach 78,000 people in Aleppo \u8212\'20\'14 had been provided to the Syrian regime and the Russian Federation. According to witnesses, the convoy was hit by multiple strikes that destroyed aid trucks and then hit rescue workers who arrived to help the injured. If Monday's horrifying, outrageous attack is found to be a deliberate targeting of humanitarians, it would amount to a war crime."\par \par \uc2 Another odious\u160\'00\'A0anti-immigrant argument decimated: "The chance of an American being murdered in a terrorist attack caused by a refugee is 1 in 3.64 billion per year while the chance of being murdered in an attack committed by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  is an astronomical 1 in 10.9 billion per year. By contrast, the chance of being murdered by a tourist on a B visa, the most common tourist visa, is 1 in 3.9 million per year." Why isn't Trump against common tourist visas? Ah, the Trump hotels. . .\par \par \uc2 It's appalling that Republicans don't understand America as well as Irish music star Bono: ""Look, America is like the best idea the world ever came up with. But \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  is potentially the worst idea that ever happened to America. Potentially."\par \par \uc2 His minority "outreach" has been a terrible\u160\'00\'A0failure. In North Carolina: "Clinton continues to dominate among black voters, with 98 percent support. The remaining 2 percent said they plan to vote for Trump."\par \par \uc2 If Trump were capable of apologizing for a\u160\'00\'A0contemptible \u160\'00\'A0smear, he wouldn't have started the birther nonsense in the first place. "\uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  should apologize for pushing the 'unseemly' birther conspiracy regarding where President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  was born, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham indicated Tuesday."\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020160921ec9l002xl\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Gun rights advocates don't enjoy being falsely depicted as dimwits who can't answer the most basic of questions about their No. 1 public policy issue.\par \par \uc2 That's the takeaway from a defamation lawsuit filed today against Katie Couric and the producers of "Under the Gun," a documentary about gun violence in the United States. Having debuted at the Sundance Film Festival in January, the documentary itself came under the gun in May, when members of the \uc2 Virginia Citizens Defense League\uc2  (VCDL) claimed that it slighted them by mal-editing an interview in which they'd participated. In response to a question from Couric, the film's narrator, the gun rights advocates were depicted as sitting in baffled silence for nearly 10 seconds.\par \par \uc2 In fact, they had supplied an extensive response to Couric's question.\par \par \uc2 Many onlookers, including the Erik Wemple Blog, blasted the film for this portrayal. Couric, the global anchor of Yahoo News, initially stood by the product but ultimately apologized for the "misleading" edit. The film's director, Stephanie Soechtig, wasn't so contrite. "I think it's sad to say that these eight seconds didn't give the VCDL a platform to speak. Their views are expressed repeatedly throughout the film; we know how they feel about background checks. They said it earlier in the film," said Soechtig in an interview after the furor.\par \par \uc2 Intransigence of that sort may bedevil Soechtig in a legal action filed by the VCDL and two gun rights defenders in the film -- Daniel Hawes and Patricia Webb -- against Couric, Soechtig, Atlas Films and Epix, the documentary's distributor. Filed in a Virginia federal court by Elizabeth Locke of Clare Locke LLP, the complaint states, "The Defendants manipulated the footage in service of an agenda: they wanted to establish that there is no basis for opposing background checks, by fooling viewers into believing that even a panel of pro-Second Amendment advocates could not provide one." It seeks compensatory damages of $12 million, and punitive damages of $350,000 per plaintiff.\par \par \uc2 The filmmakers gave this particular lawsuit a galloping start, with a dreadful sequence that comes less than a half-hour into the one-hour-and-45-minute documentary. Seated in a circle are members of the VCDL against a dark backdrop. Couric asks this question: "If there are no background checks for gun purchasers, how do you prevent felons or terrorists from purchasing a\u160\'00\'A0gun?" In response, the VCDL members say precisely nothing. They stare into space, or at the floor. Brain-freeze appears to have enveloped them.\par \par \uc2 As the suit notes, this depiction is a "work of fiction." The VCDL members actually filled Couric's ear; Hawes, for example, said this:\par \par \uc2 The fact is we do have statutes, both at the federal and state level that prohibit classes of people from being in possession of firearms. If you're under 18, in Virginia, you can't walk around with a gun. If you're an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , if you're a convicted felon, if you've been adjudicated insane, these things are already illegal. So, what we're really asking about is a question of prior restraint. How can we prevent future crime by identifying bad guys before they do anything bad? And, the simple answer is you can't. And, particularly, under the legal system we have in the United States, there are a lot of Supreme Court opinions that say, "No, prior restraint is something that the government does not have the authority to do." Until there is an overt act that allows us to say, "That's a bad guy," then you can't punish him.\par \par \uc2 That argument, notes the complaint, is part of the six minutes that the gun rights advocates spent answering Couric's question. Showing the VCDL as dumbfounded required some work on the part of the filmmakers. In coordinating the interview with the VCDL advocates, Couric and a cameraman from Atlas Films told them that they needed to sit in silence for 10 seconds so that the crew could calibrate the "recording equipment." It was this passage that "Under the Gun" placed in the film instead of the actual answers supplied to the question about background checks. The suit alleges that this moment carried particular implications for each of the named plaintiffs in the case. Webb is a licensed firearms dealer (Gadsden Guns Inc.), and the edits indicate that "she lacks knowledge regarding background checks \u8212\'20\'14 a requirement for every gun sale she does," argues the complaint. Hawes is an attorney who handles cases involving firearms, and the film suggests that "he lacks the legal expertise and oral advocacy skills required to perform his duties."\par \par \uc2 After folks objected to the treatment, Soechtig issued a statement stunning in its implausibility: "There are a wide range of views expressed in the film. My intention was to provide a pause for the viewer to have a moment to consider this important question before presenting the facts on Americans' opinions on background checks. I never intended to make anyone look bad and I apologize if anyone felt that way."\par \par \uc2 Fact-checking of the documentary was facilitated by VCDL President Philip Van Cleave, who wisely recorded audio of the session. Careful comparison of the conversation and the resulting film yielded another consequential discrepancy for the suit against "Under the Gun": In the session, Couric's question verily conceded that the members of the VCDL had answers for the question she was about to pose. Here it is: "If there are no background checks, how do you prevent\u8212\'20\'14I know how you all are going to answer this, but I'm going to ask\u160\'00\'A0it anyway \u8212\'20\'14 if there are no background checks for gun purchasers, how do you prevent felons or terrorists from walking into, say, a licensed gun dealer and purchasing a gun?"\par \par \uc2 Bolding inserted to highlight a key point. In the film, that part about knowing how they'll answer -- it's not in there. Couric and Soechtig, claims the suit, set out to "create an advocacy film\u160\'00\'A0supporting more restrictive anti-gun legislation and background checks."\par \par \uc2 Right after showing the VCDL members sitting in stumped silence, the film shows a revolver's cylinder getting slammed shut, "driving home the point that the exchange\u160\'00\'A0was over," says the complaint. Such ham-handed imagery left a clear impression that the VCDL people had been recruited for the film for ridicule. And even though Couric initially proclaimed that she was "proud" of the product, the unmistakable slime forced her to later issue an apology steeped in detail:\par \par \uc2 As Executive Producer of 'Under the Gun,' a documentary film that explores the epidemic of gun violence, I take responsibility for a decision that misrepresented an exchange I had with members of the \uc2 Virginia Citizens Defense League\uc2  (VCDL). When I screened an early version of the film with the director, Stephanie Soechtig, I questioned her and the editor about the pause and was told that a "beat" was added for, as she described it, "dramatic effect," to give the audience a moment to consider the question. When VCDL members recently pointed out that they had in fact immediately answered this question, I went back and reviewed it and agree that those eight seconds do not accurately represent their response.\par \par \uc2 The lawsuit uses those details against Couric & Co.: "Although the Defendants knew that their intentional edits were misleading and misrepresented Couric's exchange with the VCDL, they refused to remove the manipulated footage or to present the footage of what had actually taken place. Instead, they promoted and released the film including the fictional exchange."\par \par \uc2 The Erik Wemple Blog recently downloaded "Under the Gun," only to find that it still casts the VCDL members as clueless about background checks. "The Defendants have not removed the manipulated footage from the film or replaced it with non-manipulated footage of the exchange that actually took place. To this day, the Defendants continue to promote and publish the film," reads the complaint.\par \par \uc2 In an interview about the blowup, Soechtig claimed that Couric labors under requirements separate from hers. "I also think Katie is held to a journalistic standard, but this is a film, and I'm a filmmaker and it was my decision to do so," argued Soechtig. The problem here is that honesty isn't a requirement exclusive to journalism. It's required, too, of accountants, cobblers, filmmakers and the rest.\par \par \uc2 UPDATE: Through spokesman Stefan Friedman, the following statement came from the Soechtig camp: "It's ironic that people who so passionately defend the Second Amendment want to trample the rights guaranteed to a filmmaker under the First. Stephanie stands by UNDER THE GUN, and will not stop her work on behalf of victims of gun violence."\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020160913ec9d005k2\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  and \uc2 Mike Pence\uc2  sat for an interview with ABC News anchor David Muir during a campaign stop in Ohio over the Labor Day weekend. ABC released the full transcript of their interview Tuesday night. \u160\'00\'A0Using Genius, I annotated it. You can too! Sign up for Genius and annotate alongside me!\u160\'00\'A0To see an annotation, click or tap the highlighted part of the transcript.\par \par \uc2 MUIR: Mr. Trump, Governor Pence, thank you for doing this. We sit here in the great battleground state of Ohio. 63 days to go. How badly do you need to win Ohio to win that White House?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Well we're up in Ohio and you see the kind of crowds we're having in Ohio and I think we're going to win it and certainly I think it will be very important to win Ohio. We're going to do very well in Pennsylvania. We're leading in Florida. We're doing well pretty much all over but winning Ohio. First of all, I worked here for a long period of time and I loved this state and I love the people and I think we're going to win Ohio.\par \par \uc2 MUIR: You've heard what people have said. Republicans do not win the White House without Ohio.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Well I've heard that and certainly we intend to win Ohio. We should win Ohio.\par \par \uc2 MUIR: Twenty days until the first big debate. Are you ready?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: You never know, but I think so.\par \par \uc2 MUIR: Are you prepping?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Yeah sure. I'm prepping, maybe not in the traditional way. When I had the debates, I had 11 debates with the -- as you know -- in the primaries, and I was very satisfied. Everybody else was very satisfied with the way I did. And I think I'm working the same way I did there.\par \par \uc2 MUIR: But this will be a lot different. I mean there will be two candidates on that stage. It won't be, you know, the list that was there during the primary.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Well we started off with 17 and in the end we had just a few left so, it's not that much different. But I look forward to the debates. I think it's gonna be very revealing.\par \par \uc2 MUIR: Any mock debates?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Haven't thought about it much. It could happen. But haven't really given it much thought.\par \par \uc2 MUIR: I read somewhere that when you were asked about the debate. You were asked about the debates and you said, 'I know how to handle Hillary.'\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I don't think I'd ever say that about anybody. I don't know how to handle you. I don't know how to handle anybody. I'm me. I just do what I have to do. And what we're going to be doing -- and you see it from outside when you look at those Ohio crowds we have 60 or 70,000 people right outside the door. That's, nobody's ever had that and what I know how to do is create jobs and that's what I'm going to do.\par \par \uc2 I'm bringing jobs back to Ohio and Pennsylvania and all of the states and they know my stance on immigration and it's the proper stance. But we're going to bring jobs back. We're gonna give jobs back in these states because we are being drained, our country's being drained of its jobs. And we can't have that. I see people today, they want hope, they're desperate, they're desperate. We had 15,000 people working in a factory and now they're down to 500 people. From 15,000 they're down to 500 and the jobs have all left and the companies have gone to Mexico and other places. We're not going to stand for that.\par \par \uc2 MUIR: We couldn't help but to notice that the Trump Pence plane is at the airport and so is \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 's new plane. Does that signal to you that it's game on?\par \par \uc2 PENCE: Well I think it's been game on with \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  since the very beginning and that's the reason why everyday he's been winning more hearts and minds all across this country with a simple message that we can make America great again. I mean you saw thousands of people out at this county fair today. And they're responding to a strong leader but even beyond that he'd be the first to say this is a movement of people that know that the leadership of \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  and \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  has weakened America's place in the world, stifled America's economy and \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  has the qualities of leadership and he has the vision to strengthen America at home and abroad.\par \par \uc2 MUIR: Let me ask you Mr. Trump you just traveled to Mexico and you said shortly after that you and the Mexican president did not discuss who would pay for the wall. And then afterward the president of Mexico said it was discussed and that he said Mexico will not pay for it. \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 , who's also here in Ohio, as you know, told us a short time ago that you choked, that the idea of Mexico paying for this wall has been central to your campaign. Did you choke?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: So let me just tell you about choking. I don't choke. She chokes. Look at the deals she's made. She's responsible for so many bad things that have happened to our country including the signing by her husband of \uc2 NAFTA\uc2 , which has drained our country of its jobs. I've been given A plus, including by you people, but I've been given A pluses for the job I did in Mexico. All that is is a Madison Avenue soundbite. Whether I did phenomenally or not they would have said that. That was a tremendous success for me. You know that virtually everybody including my biggest critics have said that when I went down to Mexico it was a tremendous success. Mike called me and said, 'I've never seen anybody look so presidential.' Many people have said that.\par \par \uc2 PENCE: It's true.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: And the fact is Mexico will pay for the wall, it was discussed that it wouldn't be discussed but they know my stance and I know their stance. And until I'm president I'm not going to press anything very much, but they fully know my stance. My stance is we're going to build a wall and Mexico's going to pay for the wall. It's very simple.\par \par \uc2 MUIR: Did the Mexican president break his word in talking about it?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: They all know the ground rules and the ground rules were there. \uc2 Rudy Giuliani\uc2  said it, in fact Rudy was surprised. \uc2 Rudy Giuliani\uc2  spoke very eloquently about it. The ground rules. And we had ground rules and that's OK. They know my stance and I know their stance. See who wins in the end. We'll win, 100 percent, they're going to pay for the wall.\par \par \uc2 We're going to build a wall, they're going to pay for the wall, we're going to keep drugs out, we're going to keep the people that-- we have gangs, we have gang leaders. We have drug kings. We have all of these people flowing into our country, all of those people are going to get out. We're gonna get 'em out. We're gonna stop the flow of drugs into our country.\par \par \uc2 Our country is being poisoned. Our youth are being destroyed. We have cities over the weekend 20 people are overdosed on drugs. Twenty people from one city and dying. They're dying all over our country and it's coming, mostly, from that section of the world. We're gonna stop it.\par \par \uc2 PENCE: Other than \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  and Tim Kaine, \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 's visit to Mexico City was universally praised. You remember that \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  and Tim Kaine have basically tried to paint a picture of \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  that, just because you're a strong leader at home and you have a strong vision about America's place in the world that you don't have the ability to sit down in a diplomatic setting and build relationships with world leaders. Last Wednesday what the American people saw, and frankly, what the world saw, was a gracious man who will represent America great on a world stage, but also will do it in a way that will command the respect of the world.\par \par \uc2 MUIR: Governor, you know what the Clinton team will say though. That Mr. Trump is talking often about Mexico paying for that wall and that this campaign returned with Mexico saying, 'we're not paying for it.'\par \par \uc2 PENCE: You know what you have in \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  is not-\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Oh, he didn't say that. He tweeted that long after the meeting was over. He didn't say that.\par \par \uc2 MUIR: You tweet a lot too though.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I do\par \par \uc2 MUIR: And we take you at your word.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: You have 25 million people with \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , why wouldn't I take advantage of something. But the fact is he didn't say that, he tweeted that after I left and then in the speech I made in Arizona -- which was also a really respected speech on immigration -- I said, 'And by the way, Mexico will pay for the wall.' I also said they might not even know it yet. But Mexico will pay for the wall, 100 percent and it's easy because they're making so much money. They're taking our jobs. Drugs are pouring across the border. They make a fortune off the United States. Both at the border and with jobs.\par \par \uc2 And I like them very much, I get along very well with the president. Very, very well. I think we'll have a very good relationship, but Mexico will pay for the wall.\par \par \uc2 MUIR: You talk about the speech. The central premise of the speech was immigration and let me just ask you about what one of your top surrogates, in the last 24 hours, \uc2 Rudy Giuliani\uc2  said that \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  would 'find it very difficult to throw a family that's been here in the United States for 15 years with kids who are now American citizens out of this country.' That that's not the America that \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  wants. So will some of these families be allowed to stay?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: First of all he's 100 percent right. It's very difficult. It's a very difficult thing to do. Here's what we're going to do. It's very simple. It was put out in the speech and most people understood it but the crowd -- we had 15,000 people and they're going wild and a lot of people I guess didn't hear it or they just were watching the reaction. What we're going to do is we're going to build a tremendously strong and powerful boarder. People are going to come in, but they're going to come in legally. We're going to get rid of all of the bads: the gang members, the drug lords and all of the different people that are here and that shouldn't be here. We're gonna clean things up.\par \par \uc2 Once we have a secure border -- totally secure -- we're going to take a look at the people that you're talking about. We're going to look at it from where our country is, from where we stand in the world, from how we're doing as a country. We're going to take a very good, strong, hard look at the people that remained.\par \par \uc2 MUIR: When you take a good, strong hard look, does that mean some of those 11 million undocumented immigrants will be allowed to stay?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: It could be, but what's going to happen is, if you're going to be a citizen, you're going to leave and you're going to have to come back. We're going to do something -- you know we have thousands and thousands of people waiting on line. It's very, very unfair to put people ahead of the line. We have right now thousands -- they've been waiting ten years, David, to come into the country. It's very unfair to take people and have them circumvent the line. We're going to speed up the line because I want people to come into the country, but they have to do it through a legal process. Tthey have to do it legally\par \par \uc2 PENCE: David, what you're hearing here is--\par \par \uc2 MUIR: But people want to know the answer to this question. Those who are here who are undocumented who did not break the law, who are coming--\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Well they broke the law in coming into the country.\par \par \uc2 MUIR: Right.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Is that a correct statement?\par \par \uc2 MUIR: If they want to be a citizen, they will have to go home?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: If they want to be a citizen, they have to go home, get on line. Now, the line will be much more efficient. Like everything with this government, the line is a disaster right now. People are waiting for many many years and people are-- the only people that come into this country are the people that pour in. They just pour in. and many of these people are now member of the gangs and they're now selling drugs all over the country.\par \par \uc2 A lot of people are on line. It's very unfair to have them waiting for four years, for six years, for ten years and other people just walk into the country. We can't do that, but we're gonna have a very efficient process because we want people to come into the country. They have to go through the system.\par \par \uc2 PENCE: David, what \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  is calling for is a fundamental reform of our immigration system. In that speech in Arizona, he said that if people want to achieve citizenship, they have to go back in line, they have to leave the country but they won't be operating under the same visa caps of the past.\par \par \uc2 We're gonna be working with the Congress a new commission that our new president will establish to revise and reform our immigration laws, but all with the load star on what's in the best interest of the American people now and going forward. That, to me, was the most refreshing part of \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 's message\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: And at the time, because you're talking about building a wall, securing our border, getting all of the criminals out -- because we have perhaps millions of people who have records, criminals. We're going to end sanctuary cities where they see people are protected. They're swaddled, they're protected. We can't do that anymore. I look at the families who have been destroyed by illegal immigrants killing their daughters, their sons, their husband, their wives. We're not gonna have that any more, David. We're not going to have that. So we will see, at the end of the process, where we are as a country and what we'll do.\par \par \uc2 MUIR: So when those families do ultimately go home, the ones who have no record who are here, once you get the wall and the criminals out of here, as you say. Is it self-deportation?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: No.\par \par \uc2 MUIR: Or will you deport them?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: No.\par \par \uc2 MURI: How does it work?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: They will-- If they want to become a citizen, they'll go out and they'll come back in through a process, but they have to get on line,\par \par \uc2 MUIR: But what is that called? I mean, most people call it--\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: They don't call it anything\par \par \uc2 MUIR: Will they have to go--\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: They don't call it anything, OK? They don't call it anything. They will get on line, they'll go behind people that have been waiting for four, five years. By that time the line, I'm sure, will be much more efficient because we do things efficiently -- right now it's a bureaucratic mess. It's a total mess. You know a lot of people don't come in legally because of the fact that people are just pouring across the border. That's the way they come into the country, right. So they will get on line and they will come in through an efficient process if they want to become a citizen.\par \par \uc2 MUIR: And if they don't want to become a citizen?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: They have to make a determination what happens when the border is secure\par \par \uc2 MUIR: So you're open to them staying here undocumented?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I'm going to make a decision, or somebody will. Whether it's me or somebody else because, perhaps, depending on the time -- by that time we'll have a secure border, we'll have a wall. We will have stopped the drugs pouring into the country. I mean, you look at states like Ohio you look at states like Pennsylvania or New Hampshire, the biggest thing on their minds is drugs. I say, 'What's your biggest problem?' It's jobs and it's drugs. We're gonna stop the drugs and we're gonna bring jobs back to our states. We're going to bring jobs back to our country.\par \par \uc2 PENCE: And \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  has laid out a plan to end illegal immigration once and for all, which has a direct relationship to the struggling economy that we face. The fact is that, here in Ohio and all over the country, illegal immigration now, for more than a generation, has cost Americans jobs, it has suppressed wages and it's had all the other affects that he's talked about so clearly and openly across the country.\par \par \uc2 I think what the American people are seeing is a leader that knows how to put first things first. Whether it be in a meeting in Mexico City with the president where they focused on first building a relationship, talking about the five things they agreed on: ending illegal immigration, human trafficking, ending the flow of illicit drugs and other issues. And also in this area, what people heard from Arizona last week was \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  saying we're going to put border security and internal enforcement and removing criminal aliens and those who have overstayed their visas, we're going to deal with all of that, and for those that remain we'll have that discussion in the future.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: David, we have to stop the illegal flow of drugs into our country. Our country is a disaster, our youth is being poisoned, and I'm not talking about small numbers, I'm talking about massive numbers of young people whose lives are going to be destroyed and are destroyed in many cases because they're hooked and they can't get off it. Heroin, in particular, is so hard to get off, they're hooked.\par \par \uc2 We are going to stop the illegal flow of drugs and, as you know, 16,500 border patrol agents endorsed me. They know better than anybody what's happening. They endorsed me. I said to them, 'How important is the wall?' They said, 'Mr. Trump, it is absolutely imperative, especially for the stopping of the drugs that are pouring in.'\par \par \uc2 MUIR: I do want to ask one more question on something you said a moment ago about people who are undocumented. You are open to the possibility that ultimately they might simply stay?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: We're going to make that determination at the time. Once we have a secure border and we stop the drugs and stop the bad ones and get the bad ones out, those are going to be gone immediately. Day one, first hour, I"m going to give a mandate to everybody, including the local police because they know. You know the local police know every one of the bad ones, it's not like, 'Oh gee, let's figure out who it is.' They know every bad gang member, drug kingpin, they know all of them. As soon as I will be in office for one hour and that order will go out. We're getting them the hell out of the country.\par \par \uc2 PENCE: But David, let me also say it's very appropriate to have lots of interest in what a President \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  will do on illegal immigration. \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  put the issue of illegal immigration at the center of the national debate. But what I'd also like to see, and I think millions of Americans would like to see, is more clarity about HIllary Clinton's plan.\par \par \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  is presumably for open borders. She intends to impose the unconstitutional executive amnesty that the supreme court rejected. I mean, she actually wants to increase the Syrian refugee program by 550 percent. I think as much attention that's being paid to my running mate and our position on illegal immigration, the American people deserve to know that \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  will advocate the policies of amnesty that the American people want to reject and it will continue the flow of illegal immigration that's costing jobs in this country and too often resulting in tragedy.\par \par \uc2 MUIR: And when it comes to Syrian refugees you still--\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Over.\par \par \uc2 MUIR: Done, right now?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Done. No more. Done. We have no idea who they are, we have no idea are they ISIS-related, we have absolutely no clue. And you see what happens with just one person. You take a look, all over the world, not just here, not just San Bernadino or Orlando, or any of the other places. You take a look at what one person does, the destruction that one person can do. And it is interesting with \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  she wants to let the Syrian refugees, or whoever they are, pour into our country. We don't even know where they're putting them. You know the governors of states don't even know who's coming into their own states.\par \par \uc2 MUIR: Have you met any of the Syrian refugees who live here now already in communities in California, Idaho?\par \par \uc2 PENCE: David, that's really not the issue. The issue is that we live in such uncertain times and what \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  has put at the center of the national debate is there simply are countries, and even territories of the world, that are so torn asunder by civil war and so compromised by terrorism that our own homeland security and FBI director said we can't know who these people are. So the only thing that a president of the United States should do is to suspend that program immediately, put the safety and security of the American people first and initiate safe zones in the region for those that are fleeing from those war torn areas.\par \par \uc2 But secondly, \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  is also calling for an extreme vetting to ensure that people who are coming into this country don't represent a threat to ourselves and our families.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Extreme vetting. Let me tell you, \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  doesn't talk about illegal immigration. It's a very complex subject and it's a subject that a lot of people don't like to get into, even though everyone knows it's a tremendous, massive problem and basically her definition of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  is: come on in, folks, welcome to the country. She doesn't get who they are, where they come from, what their record is. If they're killers they're killers. Doesn't make any difference to her. It's open borders, it's take everybody's jobs, and it's a disaster.\par \par \uc2 And nobody can tell me that's a popular thing, nobody can tell me it's the right thing because it's not the right thing. And you ever notice -- you're talking to us about illegal immigration, which is fine with me -- but do you ever notice she never talks about it? She never brings it up. Because basically it's an open border policy where people are going to flow into our country.\par \par \uc2 MUIR: Let me ask you about something you said recently. You said that you have regretted moments along the way to your candidacy where your words have caused personal pain. And I'm curious, who are you talking about?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Anybody.\par \par \uc2 MUIR: Can you just give us one example?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: No, it's no specifics, just anybody. Look--\par \par \uc2 MUIR: Your campaign--\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I went through, David, I went through 16 people, we had 17. It was a very harsh, very harsh primary. People say the most in history. The most number of people, but it was the harshest in history. I was rough, they were rough on me, but you know a lot of feelings were hurt, some still, even though they signed a pledge. They haven't been able to endorse me because they haven't gotten over what took place. Number one, they lost, and number two, it was a tough primary.\par \par \uc2 MUIR: So you were primarily talking about the other candidates?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I'm talking about anybody that was offended or hurt. It's OK. Now I have to go into the future, but I said that. And I mean it. I don't want to hurt anybody, I don't want to offend anybody. But if anybody was hurt. But, if you just look at the 16 people that I-- we had a total of 17 and I'm last standing.\par \par \uc2 And now you see what's happening with Hillary. You see what's going on with her emails. It's a disgrace. It's a disgusting situation where she pretends like she doesn't know. I mean, she had her emails -- 33,000 emails -- acid washed. The most sophisticated person never heard about acid washing. Acid washing is a very expensive process and that's to really get rid of them. Really, and these emails pertain to her wedding or her yoga classes? What's gone on here is very serious, and I'll be honest, I think that the \uc2 FBI\uc2  is having a very, very hard time. I don't think they've ever been through a period where so many people are so disappointed in them.\par \par \uc2 MUIR: Do you think the \uc2 FBI\uc2  failed on this?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: It's not a question of thinking. You know what-- you cover it every night. What she did is a series of lies, gross negligence, carelessness. I mean, your document said carelessness. This is worse, this is gross negligence. They put a young man in prison, or they're going to put him in prison, because he used the wrong \uc2 Xerox\uc2  machine on something. What's going on is horrible.\par \par \uc2 MUIR: So when the director recommended no criminal charges--\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I was shocked. Especially after he read, for a fairly long period of time, just a few of the many things that she did that were illegal.\par \par \uc2 MUIR: So is that a failure of the \uc2 FBI\uc2 ?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Well it's certainly not a moment to be proud of, I can tell you that. I can tell you that I have so many people, both legal experts and civilians, regular people that cannot believe-- you see it outside. You see the people outside, how angry.\par \par \uc2 Now I just heard that we have close to 100,000 people standing outside. They're all for Trump. We're in Ohio. They're all for Trump. And you see the Hillary signs with bars on them. Look what she did is illegal. Now were the laws wrong, maybe they're very tough, but a lot of people's lives were ruined for doing two percent of what she did. Two percent.\par \par \uc2 You look at General Petraeus. You look at this young person whose mother is absolutely devastated because they're going to put her son in prison and what he did is nothing compared to what she did. It's a horrible thing. It's a horrible, horrible thing. And our country is not very proud right now, I can tell you.\par \par \uc2 MUIR: Governor Pence, you're making news this week in revealing that you'll release your tax returns.\par \par \uc2 PENCE: Sure. Will be a pretty quick read.\par \par \uc2 MUIR: Pretty quick read. I'm curious, do you think the American voter has the right to see the tax returns of \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  before they vote on election day?\par \par \uc2 PENCE: You know I'm very pleased to provide our tax returns. You're going to find out my family's a middle class family and that there will be pretty clear evidence that we haven't profited from our 16 years in and around public life.\par \par \uc2 MUIR: Governor, I'm asking about \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  and every presidential candidate going back four years--\par \par \uc2 PENCE: Look I'm releasing my tax returns. \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  will release his tax returns. I'll give mine to y'all this week and he's going to provide his after a routine audit is done.\par \par \uc2 But it's important for your viewers to know that both of us have filed what the law requires in the form of financial disclosure statements and I have to tell you, \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  filed over a 100 pages of personal financial information. People have an opportunity to review that. But I do think an awful lot of this is a bit of a distraction. I actually was asked over the weekend on another network, making some comparison between the fact that \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  made efforts to delete 17,500 emails and refused to turn those over to the \uc2 FBI\uc2  and authorities, with whether or not we had, in fact, yet released our tax returns. I just think that's an absurd comparison, to say the least.\par \par \uc2 Both of us believe in the the public's right to know. We've both been transparent, as the laws require and will continue to be. But the simple fact is that \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  needs to step forward. \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  has had more press conferences in Mexico this year than \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  has in the United States. It's time for her to come forward, start answering questions, start coming clean about what was nothing short of a pay-to-play program when major foreign donors were able to give millions of dollars to the \uc2 Clinton Foundation\uc2 . And now we know from these emails -- that she refused to turn over, that now have come to light -- that those individuals were given access, and who knows what else, at the state department while she was secretary of state.\par \par \uc2 MUIR: Let me ask you, Governor, because you said something a moment ago You think the talk about \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  and his taxes, and whether or not he'll release his returns before Election Day, you think that's a distraction?\par \par \uc2 PENCE: I think-- I have never seen, in my lifetime in and around politics, the level of media attacks on a public figure, the likes of which I've seen on my running mate.\par \par \uc2 MUIR: I guess I'm asking-- you think people ought to have the right to see--\par \par \uc2 PENCE: You have a level of dishonesty, you have a level of dishonesty in the \uc2 Clinton Foundation\uc2  and \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 , while she was secretary of state, the likes of which the American people have never seen. The \uc2 FBI\uc2  released their notes from their interview on a Friday afternoon before Labor Day weekend. But fortunately, still the press covered it very thoroughly. And we found out that she actually made classified information available through her private server that could have been hacked and exposed by enemies of this county. That had sensitive information, including information about drone strikes.\par \par \uc2 The real scandal is that we're finding out more and more every day that \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 , while she was secretary of state, and her husband, were operating a foundation that allowed foreign donors to contribute millions of dollars that wouldn't otherwise be able to contribute to American politics. And, you know, this wasn't unknown.\par \par \uc2 When Indiana Senator Richard Luger was questioning Secretary of State Clinton during her confirmation hearings, he warned her about the potential that foreign individuals would try to take advantage of the \uc2 Clinton Foundation\uc2 . I'm told that President Obama and his team actually asked her create a firewall, and now more emails that come out -- David, I just have to tell you, we'll release all the information on our tax records, \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  will release his tax returns when his audit is done -- but I believe this is all a distraction by many in the media who simple don't want to focus on this widening scandal around the \uc2 Clinton Foundation\uc2  and this pay-to-play program that happened during \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 's years as secretary of state.\par \par \uc2 MUIR: I do want to let you both know that we pressed her on the \uc2 Clinton Foundation\uc2  before we sat down with the two of you.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: That's fine. But, by the way, the \uc2 FBI\uc2  interviewed her during a major holiday, maybe it was the Fourth of July. Nobody ever heard of a thing like that. Then they released her papers late just prior to Labor Day weekend where people were away and not watching you show as much et cetera, et cetera. You need to say, what's going on?\par \par \uc2 Now, as far as my taxes are concerned, the only one that cares is the press, I will tell you. And even the press, I tell you, it's not a big deal.\par \par \uc2 MUIR: You don't think there are voters out there who--\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I don't think so. I think people don't care. But for two reasons: Number one, I released the most extensive financial review of anybody in the history of politics. It's either 100 or maybe more pages of names of companies, locations of companies, et cetera, et cetera, and it's a very impressive list and everybody says that. But I released a massive list, far more than you-- you don't learn much in a tax return.\par \par \uc2 Number two, when this routine audit is done -- and I've been audited, I think, for 15 straight years -- when the audit is done, I'll release them. I don't know when that's gonna be, it could be soon, it could be not. But every lawyer will tell you -- I was watching one of your competitors who happens to be a lawyer and said, well, nobody will release during what's called a routine audit. And that's it. I don't think anybody cares, except some members of the press. I really don't.\par \par \uc2 MUIR: Tax returns do reveal how much someone has paid in taxes. And how much they've given in charitable giving.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Well that's OK. But i've given a list on things that are given to charity. I have given that list. In fact, I made that list available. I've made a list available.\par \par \uc2 MUIR: But you won't reveal what you've paid in taxes unless the audit is done?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: When the audit is done, it will happen. I mean, I've gone through audits almost my whole adult life.\par \par \uc2 MUIR: Before we head out into the crowd that's waiting outside. We sit here in Ohio, very popular governor, John Kasich, you've stood on that debate stage against him. I'm curious, Governor Pence, do you believe that Mr. Trump is getting the support that's expected for a Republican nominee from leaders of the Republican party. Is it adequate?\par \par \uc2 PENCE: Well I think were earning more support each and every day.\par \par \uc2 MUIR: But what about Governor Kasich here in Ohio?\par \par \uc2 PENCE: Well we've been in contact with him. I hold Governor Kasich in high regard. Look, these two went through a tough competition together. I respect that, these things sometimes take time. But you know, I was in Utah just the other day with Governor \uc2 Gary Herbert\uc2  and Senator Orrin Hatch, I think we're seeing members of Congress, we're seeing governors around the country coming alongside \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 . But what gets me even more excited by a lot is the thousands of people at the county fair today. It's the thousands of people that turn out on very short notice for rallies for \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  or with \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 I mean, this is a man who has spoken into the heart of the American people, who know we can do better. Who know that seven and a half years of the kind of leadership that \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 , what \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  will continue, has weakened America's place in the world, it's stifled America's economy, and walked away from the constitutional framework our founders enshrined. And the Supreme Court is an enormously important issue.\par \par \uc2 With all due respect, David, as you've talked about a couple of issues in this interview, what I hear about, when I'm campaigning with \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  or for \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  are the security of the American people, the prosperity of the American people, the \uc2 Supreme Court of the United States\uc2  and ensuring that we have the highest standards of integrity in the highest office in the land and on every one of those issues \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  is the clear choice.\par \par \uc2 MUIR: And you'll make that case on that debate stage?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Well I think so and you know I'm disappointed that people signed a pledge -- and they signed it so I would sign it, just so you remember. The pledges were signed by everybody so that I would sign it because they didn't want me to be out there as a free agent, so to speak. But I'm disappointed-- and most of them came through, Ben Carson, \uc2 Mike Huckabee\uc2 , we have so much-- \uc2 Chris Christie\uc2 , I have so much support. People don't talk about the support.\par \par \uc2 MUIR: But as you sit here in Ohio, are you upset with Governor Kasich?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I would say I'm disappointed because we are winning Ohio, we're doing great nationally, as you understand. I mean, we're doing very well, I think we're going to win. I don't think the American people are going to allow four more years of \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  and that's what they'll get with \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  except I think it'll be even worse.\par \par \uc2 MUIR: Thank you, Mr. Trump. Governor Pence. Thank you.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Thank you.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020160907ec970048v\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 posteverything\par {\*\bkmkstart toc24}{\*\bkmkend toc24}\b \uc2 By his own definition, Trump is bigoted against whites \b0\par\par\uc2 By Kevin D. Williamson \par \uc2 1,121 \uc2 words\par \uc2 2 September 2016\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  suggests that \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  of Fifth Avenue is at heart a Klansman from Mississippi. Trump says Clinton is a "bigot."\par \par \uc2 Really?\par \par \uc2 Both of them have a bit of creepy racial stuff in their pasts: Clinton hailed the late senator\u160\'00\'A0Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.), who once bore the risible title "Exalted Cyclops" of the Ku Klux Klan, as her "friend and mentor." Trump was obliged to settle a housing discrimination case and says woefully stupid things about wanting Jews rather than blacks handling his money. But the idea that either candidate is a racist in the way David Duke is a racist is absurd.\par \par \uc2 Clinton's effort to tie Trump to avowed racists is mostly just a classic political overreach. But the way Trump explains Clinton's bigotry \u8212\'20\'14 calling her out for failed urban policy preferences and because she "sees people of color only as votes" \u8212\'20\'14 is more than a bit hypocritical. Bigotry is antipathy toward different people or ideas. Trump wants to redefine it as Clinton's indifference to one of her core constituencies, black voters. The problem with applying that line of thinking is that Trump has done basically the same thing. He got this far by pandering to white voters' worst instincts on immigration, and when it no longer helped his prospects, he began waffling on what was once his core issue. In his Phoenix speech\u160\'00\'A0on Wednesday, Trump\u160\'00\'A0returned to form, but he clearly doesn't see it as an immutable commitment.\par \par \uc2 If taking one's most loyal constituency for granted is bigotry, then when it comes to working-class whites, Trump's a bigot, too.\par \par \uc2 [Meet Trump's Pennsylvania Supporters]\par \par \uc2 A bit of context: No Republican presidential nominee has won the black vote since Herbert Hoover \u8212\'20\'14 despite the prevailing narrative, African Americans' partisan allegiances changed long before the Democrats' abrupt about-face on civil rights in 1964. From a purely Machiavellian point of view, there's one kind of black voter: reliable Democrat.\par \par \uc2 And Trump is absolutely correct that 2016 is no different. Clinton and Democrats are taking black voters for granted. Why shouldn't they? Trump is hovering between 1 and 2 percent in recent polls of black voters. While you can imagine a situation where a different GOP nominee could methodically make the case that Democratic policies in communities run by elected Democrats have trapped many black Americans in a cycle of futile government dependence, Trump is not the guy to make that case. His messaging \u8212\'20\'14 "What the hell do you have to lose?" \u8212\'20\'14 is crude, and his commitment, contrasted with his record, is utterly insincere.\par \par \uc2 Even more damning, though, is that Trump takes his voters for granted in precisely the same way. On this we have his own word: In interviews earlier this year, both on and, reportedly, off the record, he's taken the "everything's negotiable" stance. He once bragged he could shoot somebody on Fifth Avenue and not dampen the fervor of his most committed cultists, and now on immigration, his centerpiece issue, that principle is being tested. Ann Coulter famously said that there was nothing Trump could do to alienate her affections except flip-flop on his ridiculous immigration promises, but in recent weeks he's flirted with doing just that.\par \par \uc2 He was openly discussing a possible breach of faith on the one issue where he had, until now, been consistent, and upon which he built his support. As much as anything else, Trump fought his way to the top of the Republican heap by promising \u8212\'20\'14 to blue-collar whites, the slice of the body politic most receptive this approach \u8212\'20\'14 to "build a wall," make Mexico pay for it and kick every last \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  out of the country, post haste. Then he spent weeks suggesting these might not all happen, or they'd happen, as Donald Trump Jr. described it, in "baby steps," before doubling down Wednesday night in Phoenix. Earlier that day, he\u160\'00\'A0went to Mexico and reported that he didn't bring up what would be his hardest diplomatic task as president, convincing the Mexican government to pay for his wall. Clear illustrations of Trump's willingness, in his words, treat his supporters "only as votes."\par \par \uc2 Yes, he'll almost certainly get away with it, because Americans, in the main, don't use voting to make heard their views on contentious public policy matters. Most don't even know what those issues are or which politician is on which side of them. In fact, voters routinely report that they support a candidate because he holds a certain position on a certain issue when that candidate actually holds the opposite position. Political allegiance, rather, correlates strongly with cultural affiliations acquired early in life, with issues playing a minor role. That is the finding of several decades' worth of voter research ably documented by Christopher H. Achen and Larry M. Bartels in "Democracy For Realists: Why Elections Do Not Produce Responsive Government."\par \par \uc2 Voters use the ballot to make statements about who they are \u8212\'20\'14 or, at least, about what sort of people they perceive themselves to be. It's what has driven all the racism talk in recent weeks. That talk isn't really directed at African Americans or the anxious white working class. It's directed, like most things in our politics, at the relatively affluent white people drinking $4 lattes at \uc2 Starbucks\uc2 . The last thing that sort of person wants to be thought of is a racist. To be a racist is the ultimate sin in polite American society, and swing voters will not associate themselves with a candidate if doing so means they will be tarred as racists or racists-by-proxy. Kellyanne Conway, who (at least as of this writing) runs Trump's campaign, knows this.\par \par \uc2 [Trump sees black America as a dystopian hellhole. So do most white people.]\par \par \uc2 In the end, Black Lives Matter supporters in Baltimore and Trump-or-die knuckleheads in the former Confederate states may have more in common than they realize. Unlike "independent," relatively affluent, suburban white moderates, their votes already are tallied up in the mental notebooks of those running both major-party campaigns. By Trump's own standard, they're the object of Clinton's \u8212\'20\'14 and his \u8212\'20\'14 bigotry. They can be ignored and betrayed, as are the millions of loyal black Democrats trapped in failed, Democrat-dominated cities, or the overwhelmingly white corpus of new heroin addicts and the struggling communities around them, needlessly immiserated by backward drug policies and vindictive criminal-justice programs championed for two generations by the Republicans they support.\par \par \uc2 This election isn't about them. Never has been.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020160902ec920028n\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 We originally posted this conversation in June and have updated it after \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 's immigration speech.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 One of the few things that has remained consistent in \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 's shifting message on immigration\u160\'00\'A0is his plan to build a wall along the border. Trump mentioned it\u160\'00\'A0Wednesday night in his tough-talking speech in Arizona, as he has since Day One of his campaign.\u160\'00\'A0(No word on whether he persuaded\u160\'00\'A0Mexico's president, Enrique Pe\u241\'00\'F1a Nieto, to pay for it, when the two met in Mexico earlier Wednesday.)\par \par \uc2 The going wisdom is that this wall \u8212\'20\'14\u160\'00\'A0which would cost some $12 billion to $25 billion over five years\u160\'00\'A0\u8212\'20\'14\u160\'00\'A0is dead on arrival in Congress next year, even if Republicans hold both chambers. It's an expensive and hard-line proposal. A virtual wall\u160\'00\'A0wouldn't have much luck either.\par \par \uc2 But the idea of building a brick-and-mortar wall \u8212\'20\'14\u160\'00\'A0or at least some kind of barrier \u8212\'20\'14\u160\'00\'A0on the U.S.-Mexico border is hardly new. Over the past few decades, Congress has in fact\u160\'00\'A0authorized hundreds of miles of fencing along the border. True, it's not\u160\'00\'A0actual brick and mortar. But if Trump gets elected president and Congress stays controlled by Republicans, it's not hard to see how the political will is there for hundreds of miles of fence to turn into Trump's "great, great wall."\par \par \uc2 I recently caught up with Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration policy analyst at the \uc2 Cato Institute\uc2 , a libertarian think tank, to get a better sense of Congress's approach to border barriers, which has shifted over time from redirecting the flow of illegal immigration to trying to stop it completely. Here's a timeline of the big flash points:\par \par \uc2 1990: The first fence goes up\par \par \uc2 For decades, U.S. Border Patrol had been playing an endless game of cat and mouse on the vast, largely empty U.S.-Mexico border: They would catch immigrants crossing illegally, ship them back to the Mexican side of the border, and both sides would repeat.\par \par \uc2 In 1990, Border Patrol shifted its strategy from catching immigrants on the U.S. side to trying to stop them from crossing in the first place. And so the first wall was built.\par \par \uc2 Actually, it was a fence \u8212\'20\'14\u160\'00\'A0a 14-mile-long, about 10-feet-high fence along the San Diego border. There were barriers for vehicles, too, kind of like the guard rails you see along the highway.\par \par \uc2 "Outside of a port of entry, this was the first physical barrier" along our Mexican border, Nowrasteh said.\par \par \uc2 1996: Build more fences \u8212\'20\'14 but not for the reason you think\par \par \uc2 In 1996, Congress passed a law that gave the U.S. attorney general and Border Patrol the authority to build even more barriers along the border.\par \par \uc2 So up went more fences. But they were mostly congregated around higher population areas, such as San Diego and El Paso. That's because Border Patrol's immediate concern was to respond to complaints from U.S. residents about immigrants coming onto their private property. Texas's borderland in particular is about 95 percent privately owned.\par \par \uc2 "Residents were so upset about waking up and finding an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  sleeping on their yard," Nowrasteh said, "so to solve public complaints, they built a fence around El Paso and funneled these border-crossers elsewhere."\par \par \uc2 Put another way, this first series of border walls wasn't aimed at keeping all illegal immigrants out. It was aimed more at directing\u160\'00\'A0the flow of traffic away from population centers.\par \par \uc2 2005 and 2006: Build, baby, build\par \par \uc2 Illegal immigration from Mexico had been steadily climbing in the '90s, peaking in 2000 at 1.6 million per year, Nowrasteh said. But the 2005 to 2006 period was also big. More than\u160\'00\'A0a million people were apprehended on the border pretty much every year starting in 2004, in fact.\par \par \uc2 It's no coincidence that that was also when a Republican-controlled Congress, with a Republican in the White House, took its first big step toward fencing off the entire border.\par \par \uc2 In 2005, they passed a law that waived any legal barriers to putting up fences. If Border Patrol wanted to build a barrier that ran into conflict with, say, federal noise control or conservation laws, this new law said the fence took precedence.\par \par \uc2 The next year, Congress passed a bipartisan law requiring the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2  to build barriers on the border \u8212\'20\'14\u160\'00\'A0850 miles, in fact. Much of it was to be double-fenced, too. In the Senate, 26 Democrats voted for it, including New York's then-junior senator, \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 At that point, there were only a few dozen miles fenced off, so this new law marked\u160\'00\'A0a big shift in how Washington approached securing the border. The message from Congress was clear: Building a physical barrier was an acceptable and even desirable policy solution to illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 Public opinion at the time was split, with a 2006\u160\'00\'A0\uc2 CNN\uc2  poll showing 45 percent in favor of a 700-mile fence.\u160\'00\'A0Support rose to 54 percent in a 2010 \uc2 CNN\uc2  poll, though, and Republicans in particular began to demand action.\par \par \uc2 Even those who had been pragmatic when it came to immigration reform and giving illegal immigrants a way to stay in the United States felt the pressure to toe the line. "Complete the dang fence," \uc2 Sen. John McCain\uc2  (R-Ariz.) memorably said in a 2010 campaign ad, as he was facing a more conservative primary challenger.\par \par \uc2 2013: Lots of Border Patrol agents, but no fence\par \par \uc2 Up until this point, we've been talking\u160\'00\'A0about actual laws \u8212\'20\'14\u160\'00\'A0you know, bills passed by Congress and signed by the president. But to talk about today's relationship with the border, we have to\u160\'00\'A0reframe the discussion to plain old bills \u8212\'20\'14\u160\'00\'A0proposals that have been tried and mostly failed.\par \par \uc2 That's because Congress has tried and failed for several years now\u160\'00\'A0to pass immigration reform.\u160\'00\'A0The closest it got was in 2013, when a Democratic-controlled Senate voted to overhaul the U.S. immigration system.\u160\'00\'A0It didn't call for more fencing, but to appease Republicans who wanted to make sure the border was secure, it planned to send 20,000 more border agents.\par \par \uc2 Nowrasteh said over the years, in talking about the border, "fence" and "wall" have been used interchangeably in American politics. But Trump's talk of a 30-, 40-, 60-foot wall with a door in it has forced people to make the distinction.\u160\'00\'A0And the polls have reflected that. While there has been\u160\'00\'A0substantial and even majority support for border fencing, a recent poll showed relatively little support for a massive border wall. Pew asked people earlier this year whether they supported walling off the entire U.S.-Mexico border, and just 34 percent were in favor.\par \par \uc2 The bill was never brought up in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives anyway.\par \par \uc2 2016: Trump's not the only one who wants a wall\par \par \uc2 Fast-forward to the 2016 presidential campaign. Nearly every single Republican presidential candidate talked about how the border needs to be secured before any other immigration laws can change. The senators running for president had long, winding debates about who was more adamant on border security.\par \par \uc2 As such, a majority of them also wanted a wall built.\par \par \uc2 The guy who said he'd build the biggest, bestest wall of them all, of course, came out on top. And it's not hard to see how, if he's elected president,\u160\'00\'A0this could become a real initiative for his administration \u8212\'20\'14\u160\'00\'A0even if it's not 55 feet high and built of bricks.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020160901ec910058z\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  spent about two weeks waffling on his plans for illegal immigration, appearing to lean toward moderation\u160\'00\'A0on his "mass deportation" proposal.\par \par \uc2 Then he spoke Wednesday night.\u160\'00\'A0The speech was a stemwinder, promising a complete crackdown, ramped up enforcement across the board and assurance that any \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  in the United States will be subject to deportation.\par \par \uc2 All of that comes, of course, with a price tag. A big one.\par \par \uc2 Trump laid out policy proposals Wednesday night, and for many of them, we can provide at least a rough estimate of the cost using a variety of sources. There are some\u160\'00\'A0programs, though, for which we don't have solid details or estimates.\par \par \uc2 According to the\u160\'00\'A0numbers we do have, Trump's plan would add\u160\'00\'A0$51.2 billion and $66.9 billion in immigration enforcement costs over the next five years.\par \par \uc2 To put that in perspective,\u160\'00\'A0a 2014 estimate from PolitiFact\u160\'00\'A0calculated\u160\'00\'A0the United States\u160\'00\'A0was spending $16.2 billion on immigration enforcement per\u160\'00\'A0year. According to these estimates, Trump's plan would increase that annual cost by between 63 percent and 83 percent, and potentially more when you account for programs for which we don't have numbers.\par \par \uc2 Below, we break it down, proposal by proposal.\par \par \uc2 1. Southern border wall \u8212\'20\'14 $12.6 billion to $25 billion over five years\par \par \uc2 Trump has put the cost at $8 billion, but our own Glenn Kessler did some digging and found estimates ranging from as low as $15 billion \u8212\'20\'14 from Bernstein Research \u8212\'20\'14 to more than $25 billion, all told. The National Taxpayers Union, meanwhile, looked at the cost of current border fencing -- which is less expensive than building a wall -- and estimated the cost at $12.6 billion over five years. It's not clear five years\u160\'00\'A0would be long enough to finish the wall, but given Trump himself has said building the wall would be done quickly and easily, we'll say the range goes as high as $25 billion over five\u160\'00\'A0years.\par \par \uc2 (Of course, Trump repeated Wednesday night that the wall\u160\'00\'A0would be paid for by Mexico \u8212\'20\'14 something Mexico's president, whom Trump met with earlier Wednesday, said wasn't going to happen.\u160\'00\'A0But then Trump later in his speech assured it would be done\u160\'00\'A0"at a reasonable cost.")\par \par \uc2 2. End "catch-and-release" \u8212\'20\'14 $14.4 billion over five years\par \par \uc2 Trump reiterated that\u160\'00\'A0"anybody who illegally crosses our border will be detained" and deported \u8212\'20\'14 not released inside the United States. The National Taxpayers Union\u160\'00\'A0points to a\u160\'00\'A0\uc2 Congressional Budget Office\uc2  review\u160\'00\'A0of an immigration bill in the 113th Congress, which estimated that it would cost $14.4 billion over five\u160\'00\'A0years to provide state and local governments with grants to incarcerate illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 3. Triple the number of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) deportation officers \u8212\'20\'14 $10.8 billion over five years\par \par \uc2 The same bill reviewed by the CBO in No. 2 would have added\u160\'00\'A05,000 deportation officers, 700 support staff, and 60 trial lawyers. It projected this would cost $5.4 billion over five years.\par \par \uc2 Given the Trump campaign has pointed to estimates that\u160\'00\'A0there are about\u160\'00\'A05,000 ICE officers focused on deportation, you can double the CBO estimate to get a rough estimate of what it would mean to triple the number of deportation officers to about\u160\'00\'A015,000. The total cost would be about $10.8 billion over five years, according to this estimate.\par \par \uc2 4. Complete the biometric entry-exit visa tracking system \u8212\'20\'14 $6.1 billion to $9.4 billion\par \par \uc2 This is a program aimed at preventing illegal immigration through people overstaying their visas by matching their arrival records to their departure records. The \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2 \u160\'00\'A0estimated in 2008 that it would cost between $3.1 billion and $6.4 billion to implement the system just at land and sea ports. In 2003, it estimated that implementing the program on land would cost $3 billion. Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) has put the estimate much higher, at $25 billion.\par \par \uc2 We've combined the more-official DHS estimates to say the full program \u8212\'20\'14 land, air and sea \u8212\'20\'14 would be between $6.1 billion and $9.4 billion, assuming Trump wants it at all points of entry. (This could be a low estimate because of\u160\'00\'A0old estimates and inflation.)\par \par \uc2 5. Hire\u160\'00\'A05,000 more Border Patrol agents and expand the number of Border Patrol stations "significantly" \u8212\'20\'14 $4.3 billion over five years\par \par \uc2 The\u160\'00\'A0CBO\u160\'00\'A0calculated in 2013 that adding 3,500 Border Patrol agents would cost $600 million annually, or about $170,000 per agent. Extrapolating from there, we can estimate it would cost about $850 million per year for 5,000 more Border Patrol agents \u8212\'20\'14 or $4.3 billion over five\u160\'00\'A0years.\par \par \uc2 Trump didn't put a number on expanding the number of Border Patrol stations,\u160\'00\'A0but the CBO estimate included new facilities and other things these agents would need to do their jobs.\par \par \uc2 6. Restore the\u160\'00\'A0Secure Communities program \u8212\'20\'14 $1 billion over five years\par \par \uc2 The Obama administration halted this program, which used data from the Justice Department and DHS to identify foreign-born people arrested by local law enforcement. It led to the removal of an estimated 375,000 people between 2008 and 2014, but was discontinued because of\u160\'00\'A0reservations about deportation of non-criminals and how it affected relationships between local law enforcement and foreign-born residents, according to the CBO.\par \par \uc2 The administration and Congress requested as much as $184 million to fund the program annually,\u160\'00\'A0and you have to figure Trump would ramp up his\u160\'00\'A0program at a similarly high level \u8212\'20\'14 if not higher. So over five\u160\'00\'A0years, a conservative estimate would be\u160\'00\'A0$1 billion.\par \par \uc2 7. Have Congress pass Kate's Law \u8212\'20\'14\u160\'00\'A0$996 million\u160\'00\'A0over five years\par \par \uc2 This law is named after Kate Steinle, who was killed by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  in San Francisco who had previously been deported multiple times. It would require mandatory minimum sentences\u160\'00\'A0of five years for any \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who returns to the United States after being convicted of an aggravated felony or has at least two convictions for illegal reentry, and a minimum sentence of 10 years for anyone who has been deported three times and reenters.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 U.S. Sentencing Commission\uc2  says this would expand the prison population by 57,000 over five years.\u160\'00\'A0\uc2 The American Civil Liberties Union\uc2 , which opposes the law, has used that estimate to calculate that\u160\'00\'A0it would cost between $3.1 billion and\u160\'00\'A0$3.7 billion over the next decade\u160\'00\'A0\u8212\'20\'14 but with most of that coming in the second half of the decade. The latter estimate pegs it at $996 million over five years. Another group that opposes the law \u8212\'20\'14 Families Against Mandatory Minimums \u8212\'20\'14 has pegged the cost much higher, at $2 billion annually. Because\u160\'00\'A0these are interest groups, and we only have estimates from interest groups on this law, we'll go with the more conservative estimate.\par \par \uc2 8. Create a nationwide E-Verify system \u8212\'20\'14 $635 million over five years\par \par \uc2 This is an Internet-based program that cross-references information on an employment eligibility form with data from DHS and the \uc2 Social Security Administration\uc2  to make sure a potential employee is eligible.\u160\'00\'A0A 2013 CBO report stated that this would cost about $635 million over five years.\par \par \uc2 9. Restore the 287(g)\u160\'00\'A0partnerships \u8212\'20\'14 $340 million over five years\par \par \uc2 Similar to the Secure Communities program,\u160\'00\'A0ICE says this program\u160\'00\'A0"allows a state and local law enforcement entity to enter into a partnership with ICE, under a joint Memorandum of Agreement (MOA). The state or local entity receives delegated authority for immigration enforcement within their jurisdictions." It was halted in 2012.\par \par \uc2 The program cost $68 million in fiscal 2011, according to the National Immigration Forum\u160\'00\'A0and a DHS report, so we can project\u160\'00\'A0it would cost at least about $340 million over five\u160\'00\'A0years under Trump,\u160\'00\'A0even if he doesn't ramp it up.\par \par \uc2 10. Have Congress pass the\u160\'00\'A0Davis-Oliver\u160\'00\'A0Act \u8212\'20\'14 to be determined\par \par \uc2 This bill is named after two California police officers who were killed by illegal immigrants. It would\u160\'00\'A0authorize state and local governments to enforce federal immigration law and direct money to help in that effort. It would also punish localities that have created "sanctuary cities," where illegal immigrants need not fear being arrested for their immigration status. There don't appear to be any full cost estimates.\par \par \uc2 11. New screening tests for all refugees and immigrants \u8212\'20\'14 to be determined\par \par \uc2 It's not clear exactly what Trump's "extreme vetting" process would entail, so we can't put a number on it here. But currently the vetting process for refugees is $1.1 billion, so ramping that up significantly would clearly add plenty to the bottom line.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020160901ec910048v\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 post-partisan\par {\*\bkmkstart toc27}{\*\bkmkend toc27}\b \uc2 Just how many people would Trump deport? \b0\par\par\uc2 By Stephen Stromberg \par \uc2 695 \uc2 words\par \uc2 1 September 2016\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Declaring that "this election is our last chance to stop illegal immigration," \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  promised Wednesday night that "there will be no amnesty" if he is elected president.\par \par \uc2 "You can't just smuggle in, hunker down and wait to be legalized," he said. "Those days are over."\par \par \uc2 Illegal immigrants already here seeking legal status will have "one route and one route only," he said: "to return home and apply for reentry." And of those who might try to live in the shadows, he said, "Anyone who has entered the United States illegally is subject to deportation."\par \par \uc2 Heading into Wednesday's speech, the big question was whether Trump would continue "softening" on his core issue, making him a hypocrite, or revert back to his typical demagoguery, making\u160\'00\'A0him wrong and far outside the mainstream. Most of the speech \u8212\'20\'14 which included such points as: \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  would bring "total chaos and lawlessness," refugees are a "trojan horse," the U.S. will build an "impenetrable, physical, tall, powerful, beautiful, southern wall," illegal immigrants are murdering people left and right \u8212\'20\'14 he chose "wrong."\par \par \uc2 The one softer note came near the end, when Trump said this: "In several years, when we have accomplished all of our enforcement and deportation goals and truly ended illegal immigration for good\u8230\'20\'26then and only then will we be in a position to consider the appropriate disposition of those individuals who remain." In other words he would not deport all 11 million-or-so illegal immigrants living in the United States, and doing so is unnecessary to fix the immigration system. Trump left himself a smidgen of wiggle room \u8212\'20\'14 perhaps even enough to suggest he might offer legal status to some illegal immigrants during his administration.\par \par \uc2 Yet not even an eventual pathway to legal status could rehabilitate everything else he proposed \u8212\'20\'14 and render him a mere hypocrite. Though he did not promise to deport 11 million people, he nevertheless pledged to rapidly remove\u160\'00\'A0millions of people with deportation forces he would unleash into American communities.\par \par \uc2 Trump claimed that there are 2 million \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 \u160\'00\'A0criminals in the country. "We will begin moving them out. Day one," he said. The police "know who these people are," he insisted, conjuring images of officers rounding up people based on suspicions and prejudices. "My first hour in office, those people are gone," he said. "The crime will be gone." In fact, the most common type of felony conviction on illegal immigrants' records concerns violating immigration law.\par \par \uc2 Then, Trump said, he would swell the number of federal deportation agents and remove "illegal immigrants who are arrested for any crime whatsoever" \u8212\'20\'14 arrested, not convicted. On top of that, he insisted that his program would "identify hundreds of thousands of deportable aliens in local jails that we don't even know about." And, remember, he also promised that all other illegal aliens would be "subject to deportation," as well, even if they would be lower priority. These points suggest Trump plans to deport many more than 2 million people.\par \par \uc2 His deportation timetable was not crystal clear. But of the 2 million, he said, "They will go fast, believe me." He also said his plan would accomplish more "in a matter of months" than American politicians have in 50 years.\par \par \uc2 To reinforce his point, Trump referred to Operation Wetback \u8212\'20\'14 though not by name. This was an Eisenhower-era deportation program that forcibly and quickly removed several hundred thousand illegal immigrants. A Post editorial from last year \u8212\'20\'14 Trump has been citing this program for a while \u8212\'20\'14 described the operation as "a disgraceful episode that involved inhumane treatment of Mexican migrants, an unknown number of whom died or were sickened by being forcibly relocated and in many cases deposited in sweltering, remote locations with little food or water. One observer depicted 'indescribable scenes of human misery and tragedy.'"\par \par \uc2 But for Trump, the only problem with the operation was that it didn't remove people a far enough distance from the U.S. border. Even the evidence Trump cites suggests\u160\'00\'A0that his immigration plan is about as soft as a rock to the head.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020160901ec91002mh\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 the-fix\par {\*\bkmkstart toc28}{\*\bkmkend toc28}\b \uc2 Here's what \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  said in his big immigration speech, annotated ; Adding context to Trump's lengthy remarks.\b0\par\par\uc2 By Philip Bump \par \uc2 7,688 \uc2 words\par \uc2 1 September 2016\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  delivered his long-awaited speech outlining his immigration policy on Wednesday night in Phoenix, the city where he launched his campaign on the same issue last year. A transcript of Trump's speech is below. Sections in yellow have been annotated by The Fix team and will offer more information when clicked.\par \par \uc2 Thank you, Phoenix. I am so glad to be back in Arizona.\par \par \uc2 The state that has a very, very special place in my heart. I love people of Arizona and together we are going to win the White House in November.\par \par \uc2 Now, you know this is where it all began for me. Remember that massive crowd also. So, I said let's go and have some fun tonight. We're going to Arizona, OK?\par \par \uc2 This will be a little bit different. This won't be a rally speech, per se. Instead, I'm going to deliver a detailed policy address on one of the greatest challenges facing our country today, illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 I've just landed having returned from a very important and special meeting with the President of Mexico, a man I like and respect very much. And a man who truly loves his country, Mexico.\par \par \uc2 And, by the way, just like I am a man who loves my country, the United States.\par \par \uc2 We agree on the importance of ending the illegal flow of drugs, cash, guns, and people across our border, and to put the cartels out of business.\par \par \uc2 We also discussed the great contributions of Mexican-American citizens to our two countries, my love for the people of Mexico, and the leadership and friendship between Mexico and the United States. It was a thoughtful and substantive conversation and it will go on for awhile. And, in the end we're all going to win. Both countries, we're all going to win.\par \par \uc2 This is the first of what I expect will be many, many conversations. And, in a Trump administration we're going to go about creating a new relationship between our two countries, but it's going to be a fair relationship. We want fairness.\par \par \uc2 But to fix our immigration system, we must change our leadership in Washington and we must change it quickly. Sadly, sadly there is no other way. The truth is our immigration system is worse than anybody ever realized. But the facts aren't known because the media won't report on them. The politicians won't talk about them and the special interests spend a lot of money trying to cover them up because they are making an absolute fortune. That's the way it is.\par \par \uc2 Today, on a very complicated and very difficult subject, you will get the truth. The fundamental problem with the immigration system in our country is that it serves the needs of wealthy donors, political activists and powerful, powerful politicians. It's all you can do. Thank you. Thank you.\par \par \uc2 Let me tell you who it does not serve. It does not serve you the American people. Doesn't serve you. When politicians talk about immigration reform, they usually mean the following, amnesty, open borders, lower wages. Immigration reform should mean something else entirely. It should mean improvements to our laws and policies to make life better for American citizens.\par \par \uc2 Thank you. But if we're going to make our immigration system work, then we have to be prepared to talk honestly and without fear about these important and very sensitive issues. For instance, we have to listen to the concerns that working people, our forgotten working people, have over the record pace of immigration and its impact on their jobs, wages, housing, schools, tax bills and general living conditions.\par \par \uc2 These are valid concerns expressed by decent and patriotic citizens from all backgrounds, all over. We also have to be honest about the fact that not everyone who seeks to join our country will be able to successfully assimilate. Sometimes it's just not going to work out. It's our right, as a sovereign nation to chose immigrants that we think are the likeliest to thrive and flourish and love us.\par \par \uc2 Then there is the issue of security. Countless innocent American lives have been stolen because our politicians have failed in their duty to secure our borders and enforce our laws like they have to be enforced. I have met with many of the great parents who lost their children to sanctuary cities and open borders. So many people, so many, many people. So sad. They will be joining me on this stage in a little while and I look forward to introducing, these are amazing, amazing people.\par \par \uc2 Countless Americans who have died in recent years would be alive today if not for the open border policies of this administration and the administration that causes this horrible, horrible thought process, called \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 This includes incredible Americans like 21 year old Sarah Root. The man who killed her arrived at the border, entered Federal custody and then was released into the U.S., think of it, into the U.S. community under the policies of the White House \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  and \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 . Weak, weak policies. Weak and foolish policies.\par \par \uc2 He was released again after the crime, and now he's out there at large. Sarah had graduated from college with a 4.0, top student in her class one day before her death.\par \par \uc2 Also among the victims of the \uc2 Obama\uc2 -Clinton open-border policy was Grant Ronnebeck, a 21-year-old convenience store clerk and a really good guy from Mesa, Arizona. A lot of you have known about Grant.\par \par \uc2 He was murdered by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  gang member previously convicted of burglary, who had also been released from federal custody, and they knew it was going to happen again.\par \par \uc2 Another victim is Kate Steinle. Gunned down in the sanctuary city of San Francisco, by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , deported five previous times. And they knew he was no good.\par \par \uc2 Then there is the case of 90-year-old Earl Olander, who was brutally beaten and left to bleed to death in his home, 90 years old and defenseless. The perpetrators were illegal immigrants with criminal records a mile long, who did not meet Obama administration standards for removal. And they knew it was going to happen.\par \par \uc2 In California, a 64-year-old Air Force veteran, a great woman, according to everybody that knew her, Marilyn Pharis, was sexually assaulted and beaten to death with a hammer. Her killer had been arrested on multiple occasions but was never, ever deported, despite the fact that everybody wanted him out.\par \par \uc2 A 2011 report from the \uc2 Government Accountability Office\uc2  found that illegal immigrants and other non-citizens, in our prisons and jails together, had around 25,000 homicide arrests to their names, 25,000.\par \par \uc2 On top of that, illegal immigration costs our country more than $113 billion a year. And this is what we get. For the money we are going to spend on illegal immigration over the next 10 years, we could provide 1 million at-risk students with a school voucher, which so many people are wanting.\par \par \uc2 While there are many illegal immigrants in our country who are good people, many, many, this doesn't change the fact that most illegal immigrants are lower skilled workers with less education, who compete directly against vulnerable American workers, and that these illegal workers draw much more out from the system than they can ever possibly pay back.\par \par \uc2 And they're hurting a lot of our people that cannot get jobs under any circumstances.\par \par \uc2 But these facts are never reported. Instead, the media and my opponent discuss one thing and only one thing, the needs of people living here illegally. In many cases, by the way, they're treated better than our vets.\par \par \uc2 Not going to happen anymore, folks. November 8th. Not going to happen anymore.\par \par \uc2 The truth is, the central issue is not the needs of the 11 million illegal immigrants or however many there may be -- and honestly we've been hearing that number for years. It's always 11 million. Our government has no idea. It could be 3 million. It could be 30 million. They have no idea what the number is.\par \par \uc2 Frankly our government has no idea what they're doing on many, many fronts, folks.\par \par \uc2 But whatever the number, that's never really been the central issue. It will never be a central issue. It doesn't matter from that standpoint. Anyone who tells you that the core issue is the needs of those living here illegally has simply spent too much time in Washington.\par \par \uc2 Only the out-of-touch media elites think the biggest problems facing America -- you know this, this is what they talk about, facing American society today is that there are 11 million illegal immigrants who don't have legal status. And, they also think the biggest thing, and you know this, it's not nuclear, and it's not ISIS, it's not Russia, it's not China, it's global warming.\par \par \uc2 To all the politicians, donors, and special interests, hear these words from me and all of you today. There is only one core issue in the immigration debate, and that issue is the well-being of the American people.\par \par \uc2 Nothing even comes a close second. \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 , for instance, talks constantly about her fears that families will be separated, but she's not talking about the American families who have been permanently separated from their loved ones because of a preventable homicide, because of a preventable death, because of murder.\par \par \uc2 No, she's only talking about families who come here in violation of the law. We will treat everyone living or residing in our country with great dignity. So important.\par \par \uc2 We will be fair, just, and compassionate to all, but our greatest compassion must be for our American citizens.\par \par \uc2 Thank you.\par \par \uc2 President \uc2 Obama\uc2  and \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  have engaged in gross dereliction of duty by surrendering the safety of the American people to open borders, and you know it better than anybody right here in Arizona. You know it.\par \par \uc2 President \uc2 Obama\uc2  and \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  support sanctuary cities. They support catch and release on the border. They support visa overstays. They support the release of dangerous, dangerous, dangerous, criminals from detention. And, they support unconstitutional executive amnesty.\par \par \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  has pledged amnesty in her first 100 days, and her plan will provide Obamacare, Social Security, and Medicare for illegal immigrants, breaking the federal budget.\par \par \uc2 On top of that she promises uncontrolled, low-skilled immigration that continues to reduce jobs and wages for American workers, and especially for African-American and Hispanic workers within our country. Our citizens.\par \par \uc2 Most incredibly, because to me this is unbelievable, we have no idea who these people are, where they come from. I always say Trojan horse. Watch what's going to happen, folks. It's not going to be pretty.\par \par \uc2 This includes her plan to bring in 620,000 new refugees from Syria and that region over a short period of time. And even yesterday, when you were watching the news, you saw thousands and thousands of people coming in from Syria. What is wrong with our politicians, our leaders if we can call them that. What the hell are we doing?\par \par \uc2 Hard to believe. Hard to believe. Now that you've heard about \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 's plan, about which she has not answered a single question, let me tell you about my plan. And do you notice - -\par \par \uc2 And do you notice all the time for weeks and weeks of debating my plan, debating, talking about it, what about this, what about that. They never even mentioned her plan on immigration because she doesn't want to get into the quagmire. It's a tough one, she doesn't know what she's doing except open borders and let everybody come in and destroy our country by the way.\par \par \uc2 While \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  meets only with donors and lobbyists, my plan was crafted with the input from federal immigration offices, very great people. Among the top immigration experts anywhere in this country, who represent workers, not corporations, very important to us.\par \par \uc2 I also worked with lawmakers, who've led on this issue on behalf of American citizens for many years. And most importantly I've met with the people directly impacted by these policies. So important.\par \par \uc2 Number one, are you ready? Are you ready?\par \par \uc2 We will build a great wall along the southern border.\par \par \uc2 And Mexico will pay for the wall.\par \par \uc2 One hundred percent. They don't know it yet, but they're going to pay for it. And they're great people and great leaders but they're going to pay for the wall. On day one, we will begin working on intangible, physical, tall, power, beautiful southern border wall.\par \par \uc2 We will use the best technology, including above and below ground sensors that's the tunnels. Remember that, above and below.\par \par \uc2 Above and below ground sensors. Towers, aerial surveillance and manpower to supplement the wall, find and dislocate tunnels and keep out criminal cartels and Mexico you know that, will work with us. I really believe it. Mexico will work with us. I absolutely believe it. And especially after meeting with their wonderful, wonderful president today. I really believe they want to solve this problem along with us, and I'm sure they will.\par \par \uc2 Number two, we are going to end catch and release. We catch them, oh go ahead. We catch them, go ahead.\par \par \uc2 Under my administration, anyone who illegally crosses the border will be detained until they are removed out of our country and back to the country from which they came.\par \par \uc2 And they'll be brought great distances. We're not dropping them right across. They learned that. President Eisenhower. They'd drop them across, right across, and they'd come back. And across.\par \par \uc2 Then when they flew them to a long distance, all of a sudden that was the end. We will take them great distances. But we will take them to the country where they came from, OK?\par \par \uc2 Number three. Number three, this is the one, I think it's so great. It's hard to believe, people don't even talk about it. Zero tolerance for criminal aliens. Zero. Zero.\par \par \uc2 Zero. They don't come in here. They don't come in here.\par \par \uc2 According to federal data, there are at least 2 million, 2 million, think of it, criminal aliens now inside of our country, 2 million people criminal aliens. We will begin moving them out day one. As soon as I take office. Day one. In joint operation with local, state, and federal law enforcement.\par \par \uc2 Now, just so you understand, the police, who we all respect -- say hello to the police. Boy, they don't get the credit they deserve. I can tell you. They're great people. But the police and law enforcement, they know who these people are.\par \par \uc2 They live with these people. They get mocked by these people. They can't do anything about these people, and they want to. They know who these people are. Day one, my first hour in office, those people are gone.\par \par \uc2 And you can call it deported if you want. The press doesn't like that term. You can call it whatever the hell you want. They're gone.\par \par \uc2 Beyond the 2 million, and there are vast numbers of additional criminal illegal immigrants who have fled, but their days have run out in this country. The crime will stop. They're going to be gone. It will be over.\par \par \uc2 They're going out. They're going out fast.\par \par \uc2 Moving forward. We will issue detainers for illegal immigrants who are arrested for any crime whatsoever, and they will be placed into immediate removal proceedings if we even have to do that.\par \par \uc2 We will terminate the Obama administration's deadly, and it is deadly, non-enforcement policies that allow thousands of criminal aliens to freely roam our streets, walk around, do whatever they want to do, crime all over the place.\par \par \uc2 That's over. That's over, folks. That's over.\par \par \uc2 Since 2013 alone, the Obama administration has allowed 300,000 criminal aliens to return back into United States communities. These are individuals encountered or identified by ICE, but who were not detained or processed for deportation because it wouldn't have been politically correct.\par \par \uc2 My plan also includes cooperating closely with local jurisdictions to remove criminal aliens immediately. We will restore the highly successful Secure Communities Program. Good program. We will expand and revitalize the popular 287(g) partnerships, which will help to identify hundreds of thousands of deportable aliens in local jails that we don't even know about.\par \par \uc2 Both of these programs have been recklessly gutted by this administration. And those were programs that worked.\par \par \uc2 This is yet one more area where we are headed in a totally opposite direction. There's no common sense, there's no brain power in our administration by our leader, or our leaders. None, none, none.\par \par \uc2 On my first day in office I am also going to ask Congress to pass Kate's Law, named for Kate Steinle.\par \par \uc2 To ensure that criminal aliens convicted of illegal reentry receive strong mandatory minimum sentences. Strong.\par \par \uc2 And then we get them out.\par \par \uc2 Another reform I'm proposing is the passage of legislation named for Detective Michael Davis and Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver, to law enforcement officers recently killed by a previously deported \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The Davis-Oliver bill will enhance cooperation with state and local authorities to ensure that criminal immigrants and terrorists are swiftly, really swiftly, identified and removed. And they will go face, believe me. They're going to go.\par \par \uc2 We're going to triple the number of ICE deportation officers.\par \par \uc2 Within ICE I am going to create a new special deportation task force focused on identifying and quickly removing the most dangerous criminal illegal immigrants in America who have evaded justice just like \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  has evaded justice, OK?\par \par \uc2 Maybe they'll be able to deport her.\par \par \uc2 The local police who know every one of these criminals, and they know each and every one by name, by crime, where they live, they will work so fast. And our local police will be so happy that they don't have to be abused by these thugs anymore. There's no great mystery to it, they've put up with it for years, and no finally we will turn the tables and law enforcement and our police will be allowed to clear up this dangerous and threatening mess.\par \par \uc2 We're also going to hire 5,000 more Border Patrol agents. Who gave me their endorsement, 16,500 gave me their endorsement.\par \par \uc2 And put more of them on the border instead of behind desks which is good. We will expand the number of border patrol stations significantly.\par \par \uc2 I've had a chance to spend time with these incredible law enforcement officers, and I want to take a moment to thank them. What they do is incredible.\par \par \uc2 And getting their endorsement means so much to me. More to me really than I can say. Means so much. First time they've ever endorsed a presidential candidate.\par \par \uc2 Number four, block funding for sanctuary cities. We block the funding. No more funds.\par \par \uc2 We will end the sanctuary cities that have resulted in so many needless deaths. Cities that refuse to cooperate with federal authorities will not receive taxpayer dollars, and we will work with Congress to pass legislation to protect those jurisdictions that do assist federal authorities.\par \par \uc2 Number five, cancel unconstitutional executive orders and enforce all immigration laws.\par \par \uc2 We will immediately terminate President \uc2 Obama\uc2 's two illegal executive amnesties in which he defied federal law and the Constitution to give amnesty to approximately 5 million illegal immigrants, 5 million.\par \par \uc2 And how about all the millions that are waiting on line, going through the process legally? So unfair.\par \par \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  has pledged to keep both of these illegal amnesty programs, including the 2014 amnesty which has been blocked by the \uc2 United States Supreme Court\uc2 . Great.\par \par \uc2 Clinton has also pledged to add a third executive amnesty. And by the way, folks, she will be a disaster for our country, a disaster in so many other ways.\par \par \uc2 And don't forget the \uc2 Supreme Court of the United States\uc2 . Don't forget that when you go to vote on November 8. And don't forget your Second Amendment. And don't forget the repeal and replacement of Obamacare.\par \par \uc2 And don't forget building up our depleted military. And don't forget taking care of our vets. Don't forget our vets. They have been forgotten.\par \par \uc2 Clinton's plan would trigger a constitutional crisis unlike almost anything we have ever seen before. In effect, she would be abolishing the lawmaking powers of Congress in order to write her own laws from the Oval Office. And you see what bad judgment she has. She has seriously bad judgment.\par \par \uc2 Can you imagine? In a Trump administration all immigration laws will be enforced, will be enforced. As with any law enforcement activity, we will set priorities. But unlike this administration, no one will be immune or exempt from enforcement. And ICE and Border Patrol officers will be allowed to do their jobs the way their jobs are supposed to be done.\par \par \uc2 Anyone who has entered the United States illegally is subject to deportation. That is what it means to have laws and to have a country. Otherwise we don't have a country.\par \par \uc2 Our enforcement priorities will include removing criminals, gang members, security threats, visa overstays, public charges. That is those relying on public welfare or straining the safety net along with millions of recent illegal arrivals and overstays who've come here under this current corrupt administration.\par \par \uc2 Number six, we are going to suspend the issuance of visas to any place where adequate screening cannot occur.\par \par \uc2 According to data provided by the Senate Subcommittee on Immigration, and the national interest between 9/11 and the end of 2014, at least 380 foreign born individuals were convicted in terror cases inside the United States. And even right now the largest number of people are under investigation for exactly this that we've ever had in the history of our country.\par \par \uc2 Our country is a mess. We don't even know what to look for anymore, folks. Our country has to straighten out. And we have to straighten out fast.\par \par \uc2 The number is likely higher. But the administration refuses to provide this information, even to Congress. As soon as I enter office I am going to ask the Department of State, which has been brutalized by \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 , brutalized.\par \par \uc2 Homeland Security and the Department of Justice to begin a comprehensive review of these cases in order to develop a list of regions and countries from which immigration must be suspended until proven and effective vetting mechanisms can be put in place.\par \par \uc2 I call it extreme vetting right? Extreme vetting. I want extreme. It's going to be so tough, and if somebody comes in that's fine but they're going to be good. It's extreme.\par \par \uc2 And if people don't like it, we've got have a country, folks. Got to have a country. Countries in which immigration will be suspended would include places like Syria and Libya. And we are going to stop the tens of thousands of people coming in from Syria. We have no idea who they are, where they come from. There's no documentation. There's no paperwork. It's going to end badly folks. It's going to end very, very badly.\par \par \uc2 For the price of resettling one refugee in the United States, 12 could be resettled in a safe zone in their home region. Which I agree with 100 percent. We have to build safe zones and we'll get the money from Gulf states. We don't want to put up the money. We owe almost $20 trillion. Doubled since \uc2 Obama\uc2  took office, our national debt.\par \par \uc2 But we will get the money from Gulf states and others. We'll supervise it. We'll build safe zones which is something that I think all of us want to see.\par \par \uc2 Another reform, involves new screening tests for all applicants that include, and this is so important, especially if you get the right people. And we will get the right people. An ideological certification to make sure that those we are admitting to our country share our values and love our people.\par \par \uc2 Thank you. We're very proud of our country. Aren't we? Really? With all it's going through, we're very proud of our country. For instance, in the last five years, we've admitted nearly 100,000 immigrants from Iraq and Afghanistan. And these two countries according to Pew Research, a majority of residents say that the barbaric practice of honor killings against women are often or sometimes justified. That's what they say.\par \par \uc2 That's what they say. They're justified. Right? And we're admitting them to our country. Applicants will be asked their views about honor killings, about respect for women and gays and minorities. Attitudes on radical Islam, which our president refuses to say and many other topics as part of this vetting procedure. And if we have the right people doing it, believe me, very, very few will slip through the cracks. Hopefully, none.\par \par \uc2 Number seven, we will insure that other countries take their people back when they order them deported.\par \par \uc2 There are at least 23 countries that refuse to take their people back after they've been ordered to leave the United States. Including large numbers of violent criminals, they won't take them back. So we say, OK, we'll keep them. Not going to happen with me, not going to happen with me.\par \par \uc2 Due to a Supreme Court decision, if these violent offenders cannot be sent home, our law enforcement officers have to release them into your communities.\par \par \uc2 And by the way, the results are horrific, horrific. There are often terrible consequences, such as Casey Chadwick's tragic death in Connecticut just last year. Yet despite the existence of a law that commands the Secretary of State to stop issuing visas to these countries.\par \par \uc2 Secretary \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  ignored this law and refused to use this powerful tool to bring nations into compliance. And, they would comply if we would act properly.\par \par \uc2 In other words, if we had leaders that knew what they were doing, which we don't.\par \par \uc2 The result of her misconduct was the release of thousands and thousands of dangerous criminal aliens who should have been sent home to their countries. Instead we have them all over the place. Probably a couple in this room as a matter of fact, but I hope not.\par \par \uc2 According to a report for the \uc2 Boston Globe\uc2  from the year 2008 to 2014 nearly 13,000 criminal aliens were released back into U.S. communities because their home countries would not, under any circumstances, take them back. Hard to believe with the power we have. Hard to believe.\par \par \uc2 We're like the big bully that keeps getting beat up. You ever see that? The big bully that keeps getting beat up.\par \par \uc2 These 13,000 release occurred on \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 's watch. She had the power and the duty to stop it cold, and she decided she would not do it.\par \par \uc2 And, Arizona knows better than most exactly what I'm talking about.\par \par \uc2 Those released include individuals convicted of killings, sexual assaults, and some of the most heinous crimes imaginable.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Boston Globe\uc2  writes that a Globe review of 323 criminals released in New England from 2008 to 2012 found that as many as 30 percent committed new offenses, including rape, attempted murder and child molestation. We take them, we take them.\par \par \uc2 Number eight, we will finally complete the biometric entry-exit visa tracking system, which we need desperately. For years Congress has required biometric entry-exit visa tracking systems, but it has never been completed. The politicians are all talk, no action, never happens. Never happens.\par \par \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 , all talk. Unfortunately when there is action it's always the wrong decision. You ever notice? In my administration we will ensure that this system is in place. And, I will tell you, it will be on land, it will be on sea, it will be in air. We will have a proper tracking system.\par \par \uc2 Approximately half of new illegal immigrants came on temporary visas and then never, ever left. Why should they? Nobody's telling them to leave. Stay as long as you want, we'll take care of you.\par \par \uc2 Beyond violating our laws, visa overstays, pose -- and they really are a big problem, pose a substantial threat to national security. The 9/11 Commission said that this tracking system would be a high priority and would have assisted law enforcement and intelligence officials in August and September in 2001 in conducting a search for two of the 9/11 hijackers that were in the United States expired visas.\par \par \uc2 And, you know what that would have meant, what that could have meant. Wouldn't that have been wonderful, right? What that could have meant?\par \par \uc2 Last year alone nearly half a million individuals overstayed their temporary visas. Removing these overstays will be a top priority of my administration.\par \par \uc2 If people around the world believe they can just come on a temporary visa and never, ever leave, the \uc2 Obama\uc2 -Clinton policy, that's what it is, then we have a completely open border, and we no longer have a country.\par \par \uc2 We must send a message that visa expiration dates will be strongly enforced.\par \par \uc2 Number nine, we will turn off the jobs and benefits magnet.\par \par \uc2 We will ensure that E-Verify is used to the fullest extent possible under existing law, and we will work with Congress to strengthen and expand its use across the country.\par \par \uc2 Immigration law doesn't exist for the purpose of keeping criminals out. It exists to protect all aspects of American life. The work site, the welfare office, the education system, and everything else.\par \par \uc2 That is why immigration limits are established in the first place. If we only enforced the laws against crime, then we have an open border to the entire world. We will enforce all of our immigration laws.\par \par \uc2 And the same goes for government benefits. The Center for Immigration Studies estimates that 62 percent of households headed by illegal immigrants use some form of cash or non-cash welfare programs like food stamps or housing assistance.\par \par \uc2 Tremendous costs, by the way, to our country. Tremendous costs. This directly violates the federal public charge law designed to protect the United States Treasury. Those who abuse our welfare system will be priorities for immediate removal.\par \par \uc2 Number 10, we will reform legal immigration to serve the best interests of America and its workers, the forgotten people. Workers. We're going to take care of our workers.\par \par \uc2 And by the way, and by the way, we're going to make great trade deals. We're going to renegotiate trade deals. We're going to bring our jobs back home. We're going to bring our jobs back home.\par \par \uc2 We have the most incompetently worked trade deals ever negotiated probably in the history of the world, and that starts with \uc2 NAFTA\uc2 . And now they want to go TPP, one of the great disasters.\par \par \uc2 We're going to bring our jobs back home. And if companies want to leave Arizona and if they want to leave other states, there's going to be a lot of trouble for them. It's not going to be so easy. There will be consequence. Remember that. There will be consequence. They're not going to be leaving, go to another country, make the product, sell it into the United States, and all we end up with is no taxes and total unemployment. It's not going to happen. There will be consequences.\par \par \uc2 We've admitted 59 million immigrants to the United States between 1965 and 2015. Many of these arrivals have greatly enriched our country. So true. But we now have an obligation to them and to their children to control future immigration as we are following, if you think, previous immigration waves.\par \par \uc2 We've had some big waves. And tremendously positive things have happened. Incredible things have happened. To ensure assimilation we want to ensure that it works. Assimilation, an important word. Integration and upward mobility.\par \par \uc2 Within just a few years immigration as a share of national population is set to break all historical records. The time has come for a new immigration commission to develop a new set of reforms to our legal immigration system in order to achieve the following goals.\par \par \uc2 To keep immigration levels measured by population share within historical norms. To select immigrants based on their likelihood of success in U.S. society and their ability to be financially self- sufficient.\par \par \uc2 We take anybody. Come on in, anybody. Just come on in. Not anymore.\par \par \uc2 You know, folks, it's called a two-way street. It is a two-way street, right? We need a system that serves our needs, not the needs of others. Remember, under a Trump administration it's called America first. Remember that.\par \par \uc2 To choose immigrants based on merit. Merit, skill, and proficiency. Doesn't that sound nice? And to establish new immigration controls to boost wages and to ensure that open jobs are offered to American workers first. And that in particular African-American and Latino workers who are being shut out in this process so unfairly.\par \par \uc2 And \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  is going to do nothing for the African-American worker, the Latino worker. She's going to do nothing. Give me your vote, she says, on November 8th. And then she'll say, so long, see you in four years. That's what it is.\par \par \uc2 She is going to do nothing. And just look at the past. She's done nothing. She's been there for 35 years. She's done nothing. And I say what do you have to lose? Choose me. Watch how good we're going to do together. Watch.\par \par \uc2 You watch. We want people to come into our country, but they have to come into our country legally and properly vetted, and in a manner that serves the national interest. We've been living under outdated immigration rules from decades ago. They're decades and decades old.\par \par \uc2 To avoid this happening in the future, I believe we should sunset our visa laws so that Congress is forced to periodically revise and revisit them to bring them up to date. They're archaic. They're ancient. We wouldn't put our entire federal budget on autopilot for decades, so why should we do the same for the very, very complex subject of immigration?\par \par \uc2 So let's now talk about the big picture. These 10 steps, if rigorously followed and enforced, will accomplish more in a matter of months than our politicians have accomplished on this issue in the last 50 years. It's going to happen, folks. Because I am proudly not a politician, because I am not behold to any special interest, I've spent a lot of money on my campaign, I'll tell you. I write those checks. Nobody owns Trump.\par \par \uc2 I will get this done for you and for your family. We'll do it right. You'll be proud of our country again. We'll do it right. We will accomplish all of the steps outlined above. And, when we do, peace and law and justice and prosperity will prevail. Crime will go down. Border crossings will plummet. Gangs will disappear.\par \par \uc2 And the gangs are all over the place. And welfare use will decrease. We will have a peace dividend to spend on rebuilding America, beginning with our American inner cities. We're going to rebuild them, for once and for all.\par \par \uc2 For those here illegally today, who are seeking legal status, they will have one route and one route only. To return home and apply for reentry like everybody else, under the rules of the new legal immigration system that I have outlined above. Those who have left to seek entry --\par \par \uc2 Thank you. Thank you. Those who have left to seek entry under this new system -- and it will be an efficient system -- will not be awarded surplus visas, but will have to apply for entry under the immigration caps or limits that will be established in the future.\par \par \uc2 We will break the cycle of amnesty and illegal immigration. We will break the cycle. There will be no amnesty.\par \par \uc2 Our message to the world will be this. You cannot obtain legal status or become a citizen of the United States by illegally entering our country. Can't do it.\par \par \uc2 This declaration alone will help stop the crisis of illegal crossings and illegal overstays, very importantly. People will know that you can't just smuggle in, hunker down and wait to be legalized. It's not going to work that way. Those days are over.\par \par \uc2 Importantly, in several years when we have accomplished all of our enforcement and deportation goals and truly ended illegal immigration for good, including the construction of a great wall, which we will have built in record time. And at a reasonable cost, which you never hear from the government.\par \par \uc2 And the establishment of our new lawful immigration system then and only then will we be in a position to consider the appropriate disposition of those individuals who remain.\par \par \uc2 That discussion can take place only in an atmosphere in which illegal immigration is a memory of the past, no longer with us, allowing us to weigh the different options available based on the new circumstances at the time.\par \par \uc2 Right now, however, we're in the middle of a jobs crisis, a border crisis and a terrorism crisis like never before. All energies of the federal government and the legislative process must now be focused on immigration security. That is the only conversation we should be having at this time, immigration security. Cut it off.\par \par \uc2 Whether it's dangerous materials being smuggled across the border, terrorists entering on visas or Americans losing their jobs to foreign workers, these are the problems we must now focus on fixing. And the media needs to begin demanding to hear \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 's answer on how her policies will affect Americans and their security.\par \par \uc2 These are matters of life and death for our country and its people, and we deserve answers from \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 . And do you notice, she doesn't answer.\par \par \uc2 She didn't go to Louisiana. She didn't go to Mexico. She was invited.\par \par \uc2 She doesn't have the strength or the stamina to make America great again. Believe me.\par \par \uc2 What we do know, despite the lack of media curiosity, is that \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  promises a radical amnesty combined with a radical reduction in immigration enforcement. Just ask the Border Patrol about \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 . You won't like what you're hearing.\par \par \uc2 The result will be millions more illegal immigrants; thousands of more violent, horrible crimes; and total chaos and lawlessness. That's what's going to happen, as sure as you're standing there.\par \par \uc2 This election, and I believe this, is our last chance to secure the border, stop illegal immigration and reform our laws to make your life better. I really believe this is it. This is our last time. November 8. November 8. You got to get out and vote on November 8.\par \par \uc2 It's our last chance. It's our last chance. And that includes Supreme Court justices and Second Amendment. Remember that.\par \par \uc2 So I want to remind everyone what we're fighting for and who we are fighting for.\par \par \uc2 I am going to ask -- these are really special people that I've gotten to know. I'm going to ask all of the "Angel Moms" to come join me on the stage right now.\par \par \uc2 These are amazing women. These are amazing people.\par \par \uc2 I've become friends with so many. But Jamiel Shaw, incredible guy, lost his son so violently. Say just a few words about your child.\par \par \uc2 SPEAKER: My son Ronald da Silva (ph) was murdered April 27, 2002 by an illegal alien who had been previously deported. And what so -- makes me so outrageous is that we came here legally.\par \par \uc2 Thank you, Mr. Trump. I totally support you. You have my vote.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Thank you, thank you.\par \par \uc2 SPEAKER: God bless you.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: You know what? Name your child and come right by. Go ahead.\par \par \uc2 SPEAKER: Laura Wilkerson. And my son was Joshua Wilkerson. He was murdered by an illegal in 2010. And I personally support Mr. Trump for our next president.\par \par \uc2 SPEAKER: My name is Ruth Johnston Martin (ph). My husband was shot by an illegal alien. He fought the good fight but he took his last breath in 2002. And I support this man who's going to change this country for the better. God bless you.\par \par \uc2 SPEAKER: My name Maureen Maloney (ph), and our son Matthew Denise (ph) was 23 years old when he was dragged a quarter of a mile to his death by an illegal alien, while horrified witnesses were banging on the truck trying to stop him.\par \par \uc2 SPEAKER: Our son Matthew Denise, if \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  were president in 2011, our son Matthew Denise and other Americans would be alive today.\par \par \uc2 SPEAKER: Thank you. My name is Kathy Woods (ph). My son Steve (ph), a high school senior, 17 years old, went to the beach after a high school football game. A local gang came along, nine members. The cars were battered to -- like war in Beirut. And all I can say is they murdered him and if Mr. Trump had been in office then the border would have been secure and our children would not be dead today.\par \par \uc2 SPEAKER: Hi. My name is Brenda Sparks (ph), and my son is named Eric Zapeda (ph). He was raised by a legal immigrant from Honduras only to be murdered by an illegal in 2011. His murderer never did a second in handcuffs or jail. Got away with killing an American. So I'm voting for trump. And by the way, so is my mother.\par \par \uc2 SPEAKER: My name is Dee Angle (ph). My cousin Rebecca Ann Johnston (ph), known as Becky, was murdered on January the 1st, 1989 in North Little Rock, Arkansas. Thank you. And if you don't vote Trump, we won't have a country. Trump all the way.\par \par \uc2 SPEAKER: I'm Shannon Estes (ph). And my daughter Shaley Estes (ph), 22 years old, was murdered here in Phoenix last July 24 by a Russian who overstayed his visa. And vote Trump.\par \par \uc2 SPEAKER: I'm Mary Ann Mendoza, the mother of Sergeant Brandon Mendoza, who was killed in a violent head-on collision in Mesa.\par \par \uc2 Thank you.\par \par \uc2 I want to thank Phoenix for the support you've always given me, and I want to tell you what. I'm supporting the man who will -- who is the only man who is going to save our country, and what we our going to be leaving our children.\par \par \uc2 SPEAKER: I'm Steve Ronnebeck, father of Grant Ronnebeck, 21 years old. Killed January 22, 2015 by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who shot him in the face. I truly believe that Mr. Trump is going to change things. He's going to fight for my family, and he's going to fight for America.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: These are amazing people, and I am not asking for their endorsement, believe me that. I just think I've gotten to know so many of them, and many more, from our group. But they are incredible people and what they're going through is incredible, and there's just no reason for it. Let's give them a really tremendous hand.\par \par \uc2 That's tough stuff, I will tell you. That is tough stuff. Incredible people.\par \par \uc2 So, now is the time for these voices to be heard. Now is the time for the media to begin asking questions on their behalf. Now is the time for all of us as one country, Democrat, Republican, liberal, conservative to band together to deliver justice, and safety, and security for all Americans.\par \par \uc2 Let's fix this horrible, horrible, problem. It can be fixed quickly. Let's our secure our border.\par \par \uc2 Let's stop the drugs and the crime from pouring into our country. Let's protect our social security and Medicare. Let's get unemployed Americans off the welfare and back to work in their own country.\par \par \uc2 This has been an incredible evening. We're going to remember this evening. November 8, we have to get everybody. This is such an important state. November 8 we have to get everybody to go out and vote.\par \par \uc2 We're going to bring -- thank you, thank you. We're going to take our country back, folks. This is a movement. We're going to take our country back.\par \par \uc2 Thank you.\par \par \uc2 Thank you.\par \par \uc2 This is an incredible movement. The world is talking about it. The world is talking about it and by the way, if you haven't been looking to what's been happening at the polls over the last three or four days I think you should start looking. You should start looking.\par \par \uc2 Together we can save American lives, American jobs, and American futures. Together we can save America itself. Join me in this mission, we're going to make America great again.\par \par \uc2 Thank you. I love you. God bless you, everybody. God bless you. God bless you, thank you.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020160901ec91000gp\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

Not according to Trump. ; Trump has denied this on more occasions that we can count.\b0\par\par\uc2 By Aaron Blake \par \uc2 913 \uc2 words\par \uc2 29 August 2016\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Donald Trump is preparing to outline his new immigration plan Wednesday. At least one outlet is reporting that Trump's big, beautiful border wall might be on the way out \u8212\'20\'14 along with his previous support for the deportation of all 11 million illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 "You have some of his surrogates now saying that Donald Trump, when he talks about the wall, is also talking about not just a physical wall, but a technological or a virtual wall, raising some questions about what exactly that means," NBC's Hallie Jackson reported Monday afternoon.\par \par \uc2 Trump may be shifting towards building more of a "virtual wall" on the border, reports @halliejackson\par \par \uc2 The Trump campaign is denying this, anonymously. But perhaps\u160\'00\'A0not even they know what their boss is about to do with his immigration policy.\par \par \uc2 Trump, after all, has been waffling for more than a week now about what to do about mass deportation. And there have indeed been certain surrogates floating the idea of more figurative wall. Former New York mayor\u160\'00\'A0\uc2 Rudolph W. Giuliani\uc2  said as recently as Monday morning that the wall would be "technological as well as physical."\par \par \uc2 Giuliani today said the wall will be "technological as well as physical." Have to wonder if they're getting ready to hedge on that as well.\par \par \uc2 But were Trump to actually go back on his pledge to build a physical wall, it would truly be one of the biggest flip-flops in political history. While the idea of a "deportation force" was central to Trump's appeal in the GOP primary, perhaps no one policy is so synonymous with the Trump brand as\u160\'00\'A0that wall.\par \par \uc2 And when people have suggested that the wall is impractical or not going to happen, Trump's response has always been the same: It's not the difficult, and it'll be a real wall.\par \par \uc2 He even said this on no fewer than three occasions last week.\u160\'00\'A0"We are going to have a real wall," Trump said during an interview with \uc2 CNN\uc2 's Anderson Cooper on Thursday.\par \par \uc2 And\u160\'00\'A0in remarks airing Wednesday night during a Fox News town hall:\u160\'00\'A0"And it will be a real wall. It will be a real wall. It won't be one of these little toys that you see every once in a while, our government throws up a little wall like this."\par \par \uc2 And this from a rally Wednesday in Tampa:\u160\'00\'A0"We're going to build a wall, don't you worry about it. We're going to build a wall. We're going to build the wall, and Mexico is going to pay for the wall, 100\u160\'00\'A0percent. And it's going to be a big wall. It's going to be a real wall. It's going to be as beautiful as a wall can be, but it's going to be a wall."\par \par \uc2 And in remarks from that same town hall airing Tuesday night:\par \par \uc2 HANNITY: I want to talk about \u8212\'20\'14 you've said a lot of things about immigration. Let's start with, I guess, your signature issue on immigration, which is you're going to build the wall.\par \par \uc2 It's true that some Trump surrogates have suggested that the wall might be virtual. Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.) said as much in May. At the time, he also referred to the "rhetorical deportation" of every \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\u160\'00\'A0"Maybe we will be building a wall over some aspects of it. I don't know," Collins said.\par \par \uc2 Trump supporter and Texas Gov. Rick Perry has been calling it a "technological" wall and a "digital" wall for months.\par \par \uc2 "It's a wall, but it's a technological wall, it's a digital wall\u8230\'20\'26" - Rick Perry, July 11 {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://t.co/V2GgHiMvtg"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://t.co/V2GgHiMvtg}}}{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://t.co/s4ZKnd1zi8"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://t.co/s4ZKnd1zi8}}}\par \par \uc2 But Trump has been steadfast on this point, giving himself no wiggle room.\par \par \uc2 What's more, while his supporters have been somewhat understanding of his waffling on deportation, the wall might be a bridge too far.\par \par \uc2 Ann Coulter released a pro-Trump book last week\u160\'00\'A0in which she said immigration was the one issue on which Trump wouldn't\u160\'00\'A0be forgiven for changing his position. When it became clear he was waffling on deportation, Coulter said\u160\'00\'A0it was the wall that mattered most.\par \par \uc2 "We're getting a wall. We're definitely getting a wall," she told the Washington Examiner. "That's the one thing we know about a Trump presidency."\par \par \uc2 Imagine if Trump yanked the rug out from beneath his hard line supporters' feet again on the wall.\par \par \uc2 It remains to be seen what Trump will say Wednesday, but for a guy who has agonized over moderating on deportation, it's hard to see why he'd suddenly feel the need to do it on the border wall, too. It may be an impractical idea that would never actually happen during a Trump presidency, but going back on both that and deportation in one speech is asking for a revolt. And while polls show that the wall is unpopular, the issue isn't as riven with racial overtones and the potential to break up families as\u160\'00\'A0deportation is.\par \par \uc2 Trump is liable to do whatever he wants on this, but given his past comments, going back on the border wall would be very difficult to do.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020160829ec8t006en\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved \par \par \uc2 Ten days after he appointed new campaign leadership, \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  and many of his closest aides and allies remain divided on whether to adopt more mainstream stances or stick with the hard-line conservative positions at the core of his candidacy, according to people involved in the discussions.\par \par \uc2 Trump has been flooded with conflicting advice about where to land, with the tensions vividly illustrated this week as the GOP nominee publicly wrestled with himself on the details of his signature issue: immigration.\par \par \uc2 A particular flash point has been whether to forcibly deport an estimated 11 million illegal immigrants from the country, a move Trump long advocated but is now reconsidering.\par \par \uc2 "He has been listening to a wide range of opinions on that," said former New York mayor \uc2 Rudy Giuliani\uc2 , who has been at Trump's side nearly constantly over the past week. "As you might imagine, there are different opinions on this, even in his campaign. In a very thoughtful way, he's trying to figure what the right position is."\par \par \uc2 "By the way," Giuliani added, "that's what everybody criticized him for in the past: that he's not able to do that. He actually is able to do that."\par \par \uc2 The conversations in recent days have featured voices from a range of Republican views, all jockeying to tilt the businessman's politics in their direction, according to those involved. Trump tends to echo the words of whomever last spoke to him, making direct access to him even more valuable, the people said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to talk about internal campaign discussions.\par \par \uc2 Those pushing Trump to soften his stances and tone - and who have gained immense influence in recent days - include Giuliani, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Fox News chief Roger Ailes, a longtime ally who has no formal role with the campaign but talks to the candidate frequently and attended a strategy session last weekend. At recent private fundraisers, many Republican donors have also urged Trump to adopt a different pitch and rethink his priorities.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, Trump continues to discuss immigration policy with Sen. Jeff Sessions (Ala.), who is seen as the populist force behind much of his candidacy. While he has defended and encouraged Trump's deliberations, Sessions is considered a balancing force against more centrist appeals. So is new campaign chief executive Stephen Bannon, the former head of Breitbart News, the hard-charging conservative website.\par \par \uc2 Trump was joined on the trail this week by Giuliani and Sessions, along with Stephen Miller, a former aide to Sessions who has become a well-trusted confidant. Trump's New York-based children continue to play an outsize role.\par \par \uc2 But any suggestion of change has alarmed some conservatives and ardent backers. Firebrand commentator Ann Coulter declared this week that it was "a mistake" for Trump to consider abandoning his support for mass deportations and said his tone "sounds very consultant to me."\par \par \uc2 The back-and-forth over immigration comes amid broader efforts by Trump to reach out to voters beyond the disaffected whites who compose his base, including events such as a roundtable Friday with Hispanic business leaders in Las Vegas. Trump also lashed out this week at his Democratic rival, \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 , for accusing him of appealing to racist elements, repeatedly labeling her a "bigot" because he says her policies don't help minorities.\par \par \uc2 Last year, Trump cast illegal immigrants as being mostly violent criminals, and he rolled out an immigration plan that embraced ideas that had long dwelled at the fringes of the GOP: no longer granting citizenship to children born in the United States to illegal immigrants, constructing a massive wall along the border with Mexico and perhaps restricting some legal forms of immigration. In interviews, Trump added that he would form a "deportation force" to remove the millions of immigrants living in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 But Saturday, Trump asked a panel of Hispanic advisers for alternate ideas and made clear that he was willing to change on the issue. The next day, newly installed campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, who has advised GOP candidates for years on how to win over swing voters, said in a \uc2 CNN\uc2  interview that Trump's position on creating a deportation force was "to be determined."\par \par \uc2 Over the next few days, Trump took a variety of positions that created a frenzy of confusion over where exactly he stands. On Tuesday, Trump said he was open to "softening" the rules for the millions of immigrants who came to the country illegally but are living peaceful and prosperous lives, only to say Thursday that his position is "hardening."\par \par \uc2 At an immigration-focused town hall in Texas on Tuesday, which was later broadcast on Fox News, Trump repeatedly polled his audience on what he should do, allowing his internal conflicts to play out publicly.\par \par \uc2 "Can we go through a process? Or do you think they have to get out?" he asked the audience. "Tell me. I mean, I don't know, you tell me."\par \par \uc2 Trump provided the crowd a sympathetic portrait of a theoretical \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who has been in the country more than a decade, building a life with children and a stable job. He repeatedly asked if that sort of person should be allowed to stay or be kicked out of the country, getting results that were often difficult to measure. At one point, Trump asked who in the crowd wanted all illegal immigrants thrown out, even the law-abiding ones, and a man stood up and bellowed: "I do!"\par \par \uc2 Fox News's Sean Hannity then asked Trump: "You heard from the audience. What does your gut tell you you want to do?"\par \par \uc2 "Well, look, this is like a poll, this is like a poll," Trump said. "And I love the guy that stood up and said - where is that guy? I love this guy. That's my guy. I mean, I get it. I get it. And I understand what you're saying. But this is sort of like a poll. And this is what I'm getting all over the country."\par \par \uc2 Trump's often contradictory comments on deportations came during interviews with Fox News or \uc2 CNN\uc2 , not during his campaign rallies. For two weeks, Trump has been reading prepared remarks from a teleprompter, a machine he had long cursed. As the week progressed, his control slipped and he went off-script more often - saying at a rally in Ohio on Monday that some urban areas are more dangerous than war zones and making a joke in Tampa on Wednesday about Clinton being medicated.\par \par \uc2 This week the campaign twice started to plan an event where Trump could give an immigration speech - an opportunity for him to settle on a position and document it - only to cancel without a clear explanation.\par \par \uc2 Trump's comment about being open to "softening" laws to help illegal immigrants came Tuesday, the same day Coulter released her new book, "In Trump We Trust," in which she writes that anything Trump does could be forgiven, "except change his immigration policies." During an MSNBC interview that night, Coulter was obviously frustrated and threatened to cancel her book tour if the candidate clearly changed his position.\par \par \uc2 "I think this is a mistake. I've thought he's made other mistakes, and I've given him constructive criticism when I think he makes a mistake," she said. "I think this is a mistake."\par \par \uc2 MSNBC's Chris Matthews asked: "Does he take your criticism?"\par \par \uc2 "Um," Coulter responded. "I haven't had a lot, but yeah. No, he does listen to people. And I'm not advising him or anything, but I did write this magnificent book."\par \par \uc2 By Wednesday, Coulter seemed confident again in Trump's candidacy as she attended a book party in Washington and told Bloomberg News's \uc2 Joshua Green\uc2 : "My worship for him is like the people of North Korea worship their Dear Leader - blind loyalty. Once he gave that Mexican rapist speech, I'll walk across glass for him. That's basically it. ... I'll criticize him, and I have, but it's all minor stylistic stuff. We all want to shoot him at various times."\par \par \uc2 Thursday, Trump took a different tone in an interview with \uc2 CNN\uc2 's Anderson Cooper and said that he foresees "a lot of people being deported," although he admitted such deportations could not all happen at once. Trump also doubled down on the notion that a majority of illegal immigrants are violent criminals who will be the first to go.\par \par \uc2 "And there are probably millions of them, but certainly hundreds of thousands," he said. "Big numbers. They're out. They're out."\par \par \uc2 At one point, Cooper asked Trump, "So if you haven't committed a crime and you've been here for 15 years, and you have a family here, you have a job here, will you be deported?"\par \par \uc2 "We're going to see what happens once we strengthen up our border," Trump replied, describing that strength in detail. "And then we're going to see what happens. But there is a very good chance the answer could be yes. We're going to see what happens."\par \par \uc2 jenna.johnson@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 robert.costa@washpost.com \par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com\par \par \uc2 WP20160828trumpweek0827\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020160828ec8s00052\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National-Politics\par {\*\bkmkstart toc31}{\*\bkmkend toc31}\b \uc2 Trump and advisers remain split on how far to move toward the middle\b0\par\par\uc2 By Jenna Johnson;Robert Costa \par \uc2 1,557 \uc2 words\par \uc2 27 August 2016\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Ten days after he appointed new campaign leadership, \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  and many of his closest aides and allies remain divided on whether to adopt more mainstream stances or stick with the hard-line conservative positions at the core of his candidacy, according to people involved in the discussions.\par \par \uc2 Trump has been flooded with conflicting advice about where to land, with the tensions vividly illustrated this week as the GOP nominee publicly wrestled with himself on the details of his signature issue: immigration.\par \par \uc2 A particular flash point has been whether to forcibly deport an estimated 11 million illegal immigrants from the country, a move Trump long advocated but is now reconsidering.\par \par \uc2 "He has been listening to a wide range of opinions on that," said former New York mayor \uc2 Rudy Giuliani\uc2 , who has been at Trump's side nearly constantly over the past week. "As you might imagine, there are different opinions on this, even in his campaign. In a very thoughtful way, he's trying to figure what the right position is."\par \par \uc2 "By the way," Giuliani added, "that's what everybody criticized him for in the past: that he's not able to do that. He actually is able to do that."\par \par \uc2 The conversations in recent days have featured voices from a range of Republican views, all jockeying to tilt the businessman's politics in their direction, according to those involved. Trump tends to echo the words of the last person with whom he spoke, making direct access to him even more valuable, the people said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to talk about internal campaign discussions.\par \par \uc2 Those pushing Trump to soften his stances and tone \u8212\'20\'14 and who have gained immense influence in recent days \u8212\'20\'14 include Giuliani, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Fox News chief Roger Ailes, a longtime ally who has no formal role with the campaign but talks to the candidate frequently and attended a strategy session last weekend. At recent private fundraisers, many Republican donors have also urged Trump to adopt a different pitch and rethink his priorities.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, Trump continues to discuss immigration policy with Sen. Jeff Sessions (Ala.), who is seen as the populist force behind much of his candidacy. While he has defended and encouraged Trump's deliberations, Sessions is considered a balancing force against more centrist appeals. So is new campaign chief executive Stephen Bannon, the former head of Breitbart News, the hard-charging conservative website.\par \par \uc2 Trump was joined on the trail this week by Giuliani and Sessions, along with Stephen Miller, a former aide to Sessions who has become a well-trusted confidant. His New York-based children continue to play an outsize role.\par \par \uc2 But any suggestion of change has alarmed some conservatives and ardent backers. Firebrand commentator Ann Coulter declared this week that it was "a mistake" for Trump to consider abandoning his support for mass deportations and said his tone "sounds very consultant to me."\par \par \uc2 The back-and-forth over immigration comes amid broader efforts by Trump to reach out to voters beyond the disaffected whites who compose his base, including events such as a roundtable Friday with Hispanic business leaders in Las Vegas. Trump also lashed out this week at his Democratic rival, \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 , for accusing him of appealing to racist elements, repeatedly labeling her a "bigot" because he says her policies don't help minorities.\par \par \uc2 Last year, Trump cast illegal immigrants as being mostly violent criminals, and he rolled out an immigration plan that embraced ideas that had long dwelled at the fringes of the GOP: no longer granting citizenship to children born in the United States to illegal immigrants, constructing a massive wall along the border with Mexico and perhaps restricting some legal forms of immigration. In interviews, Trump added that he would form a "deportation force" to remove the millions of immigrants living in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 But Saturday, Trump asked a panel of Hispanic advisers for alternate ideas and made clear that he was willing to change on the issue. The next day, newly installed campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, who has advised GOP candidates for years on how to win over swing voters, said in a \uc2 CNN\uc2  interview that Trump's position on creating a deportation force was "to be determined."\par \par \uc2 Over the next few days, Trump took a variety of positions that created a frenzy of confusion over where exactly he stands. On Tuesday, Trump said he was open to "softening" the rules for the millions of immigrants who came to the country illegally but are living peaceful and prosperous lives, only to say Thursday that his position is "hardening."\par \par \uc2 At an immigration-focused town hall in Texas on Tuesday, which was later broadcast on Fox News, Trump repeatedly polled his audience on what he should do, allowing his internal conflicts to play out publicly.\par \par \uc2 "Can we go through a process? Or do you think they have to get out?" he asked the audience. "Tell me. I mean, I don't know, you tell me."\par \par \uc2 Trump provided the crowd a sympathetic portrait of a theoretical \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who has been in the country more than a decade, building a life with children and a stable job. He repeatedly asked if that sort of person should be allowed to stay or be kicked out of the country, getting results that were often difficult to measure. At one point, Trump asked who in the crowd wanted all illegal immigrants thrown out, even the law-abiding ones, and a man stood up and bellowed: "I do!"\par \par \uc2 Fox News's Sean Hannity then asked Trump: "You heard from the audience. What does your gut tell you you want to do?"\par \par \uc2 "Well, look, this is like a poll, this is like a poll," Trump said. "And I love the guy that stood up and said \u8212\'20\'14 where is that guy? I love this guy. That's my guy. I mean, I get it. I get it. And I understand what you're saying. But this is sort of like a poll. And this is what I'm getting all over the country."\par \par \uc2 Trump's often contradictory comments on deportations came during interviews with Fox News or \uc2 CNN\uc2 , not during his campaign rallies. For two weeks, Trump has been reading prepared remarks from a teleprompter, a machine he had long cursed. As the week progressed, his control slipped and he went off-script more often \u8212\'20\'14 saying at a rally in Ohio on Monday that some urban areas are more dangerous than war zones and making a joke in Tampa on Wednesday about Clinton being medicated.\par \par \uc2 This week the campaign twice started to plan an event where Trump could give an immigration speech \u8212\'20\'14 an opportunity for him to settle on a position and document it \u8212\'20\'14 only to cancel without a clear explanation.\par \par \uc2 Trump's comment about being open to "softening" laws to help illegal immigrants came Tuesday, the same day Coulter released her new book, "In Trump We Trust," in which she writes that anything Trump does could be forgiven, "except change his immigration policies." During an MSNBC interview that night, Coulter was obviously frustrated and threatened to cancel her book tour if the candidate clearly changed his position.\par \par \uc2 "I think this is a mistake. I've thought he's made other mistakes, and I've given him constructive criticism when I think he makes a mistake," she said. "I think this is a mistake."\par \par \uc2 MSNBC's Chris Matthews asked: "Does he take your criticism?"\par \par \uc2 "Um," Coulter responded. "I haven't had a lot, but yeah. No, he does listen to people. And I'm not advising him or anything, but I did write this magnificent book."\par \par \uc2 By Wednesday, Coulter seemed confident again in Trump's candidacy as she attended a book party in Washington and told Bloomberg News's \uc2 Joshua Green\uc2 : "My worship for him is like the people of North Korea worship their Dear Leader \u8212\'20\'14 blind loyalty. Once he gave that Mexican rapist speech, I'll walk across glass for him. That's basically it. .\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09. I'll criticize him, and I have, but it's all minor stylistic stuff. We all want to shoot him at various times."\par \par \uc2 Thursday, Trump took a different tone in an interview with \uc2 CNN\uc2 's Anderson Cooper and said that he foresees "a lot of people being deported," although he admitted such deportations could not all happen at once. Trump also doubled down on the notion that a majority of illegal immigrants are violent criminals who will be the first to go.\par \par \uc2 "And there are probably millions of them, but certainly hundreds of thousands," he said. "Big numbers. They're out. They're out."\par \par \uc2 At one point, Cooper asked Trump, "So if you haven't committed a crime and you've been here for 15 years, and you have a family here, you have a job here, will you be deported?"\par \par \uc2 "We're going to see what happens once we strengthen up our border," Trump replied, describing that strength in detail. "And then we're going to see what happens. But there is a very good chance the answer could be yes. We're going to see what happens."\par \par \uc2 jenna.johnson@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 robert.costa@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020160827ec8r0002u\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved \par \par \uc2 Ten days after he appointed new campaign leadership, \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  and many of his closest aides and allies remain divided on whether to adopt more mainstream stances or stick with the hard-line conservative positions at the core of his candidacy, according to people involved in the discussions.\par \par \uc2 Trump has been flooded with conflicting advice about where to land, with the tensions vividly illustrated this week as the GOP nominee publicly wrestled with himself on the details of his signature issue: immigration.\par \par \uc2 A particular flash point has been whether to forcibly deport an estimated 11 million illegal immigrants from the country, a move Trump long advocated but is now reconsidering.\par \par \uc2 "He has been listening to a wide range of opinions on that," said former New York mayor \uc2 Rudy Giuliani\uc2 , who has been at Trump's side nearly constantly over the past week. "As you might imagine, there are different opinions on this, even in his campaign. In a very thoughtful way, he's trying to figure what the right position is."\par \par \uc2 "By the way," Giuliani added, "that's what everybody criticized him for in the past: that he's not able to do that. He actually is able to do that."\par \par \uc2 The conversations in recent days have featured voices from a range of Republican views, all jockeying to tilt the businessman's politics in their direction, according to those involved. Trump tends to echo the words of the last person with whom he spoke, making direct access to him even more valuable, the people said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to talk about internal campaign discussions.\par \par \uc2 Those pushing Trump to soften his stances and tone - and who have gained immense influence in recent days - include Giuliani, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Fox News chief Roger Ailes, a longtime ally who has no formal role with the campaign but talks to the candidate frequently and attended a strategy session last weekend. At recent private fundraisers, many Republican donors have also urged Trump to adopt a different pitch and rethink his priorities.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, Trump continues to discuss immigration policy with Sen. Jeff Sessions (Ala.), who is seen as the populist force behind much of his candidacy. While he has defended and encouraged Trump's deliberations, Sessions is considered a balancing force against more centrist appeals. So is new campaign chief executive Stephen Bannon, the former head of Breitbart News, the hard-charging conservative website.\par \par \uc2 Trump was joined on the trail this week by Giuliani and Sessions, along with Stephen Miller, a former aide to Sessions who has become a well-trusted confidant. Trump's New York-based children continue to play an outsize role.\par \par \uc2 But any suggestion of change has alarmed some conservatives and ardent backers. Firebrand commentator Ann Coulter declared this week that it was "a mistake" for Trump to consider abandoning his support for mass deportations and said his tone "sounds very consultant to me."\par \par \uc2 The back-and-forth over immigration comes amid broader efforts by Trump to reach out to voters beyond the disaffected whites who compose his base, including events such as a roundtable Friday with Hispanic business leaders in Las Vegas. Trump also lashed out this week at his Democratic rival, \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 , for accusing him of appealing to racist elements, repeatedly labeling her a "bigot" because he says her policies don't help minorities.\par \par \uc2 Last year, Trump cast illegal immigrants as being mostly violent criminals, and he rolled out an immigration plan that embraced ideas that had long dwelled at the fringes of the GOP: no longer granting citizenship to children born in the United States to illegal immigrants, constructing a massive wall along the border with Mexico and perhaps restricting some legal forms of immigration. In interviews, Trump added that he would form a "deportation force" to remove the millions of immigrants living in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 But Saturday, Trump asked a panel of Hispanic advisers for alternate ideas and made clear that he was willing to change on the issue. The next day, newly installed campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, who has advised GOP candidates for years on how to win over swing voters, said in a \uc2 CNN\uc2  interview that Trump's position on creating a deportation force was "to be determined."\par \par \uc2 Over the next few days, Trump took a variety of positions that created a frenzy of confusion over where exactly he stands. On Tuesday, Trump said he was open to "softening" the rules for the millions of immigrants who came to the country illegally but are living peaceful and prosperous lives, only to say Thursday that his position is "hardening."\par \par \uc2 At an immigration-focused town hall in Texas on Tuesday, which was later broadcast on Fox News, Trump repeatedly polled his audience on what he should do, allowing his internal conflicts to play out publicly.\par \par \uc2 "Can we go through a process? Or do you think they have to get out?" he asked the audience. "Tell me. I mean, I don't know, you tell me."\par \par \uc2 Trump provided the crowd a sympathetic portrait of a theoretical \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who has been in the country more than a decade, building a life with children and a stable job. He repeatedly asked if that sort of person should be allowed to stay or be kicked out of the country, getting results that were often difficult to measure. At one point, Trump asked who in the crowd wanted all illegal immigrants thrown out, even the law-abiding ones, and a man stood up and bellowed: "I do!"\par \par \uc2 Fox News's Sean Hannity then asked Trump: "You heard from the audience. What does your gut tell you you want to do?"\par \par \uc2 "Well, look, this is like a poll, this is like a poll," Trump said. "And I love the guy that stood up and said - where is that guy? I love this guy. That's my guy. I mean, I get it. I get it. And I understand what you're saying. But this is sort of like a poll. And this is what I'm getting all over the country."\par \par \uc2 Trump's often contradictory comments on deportations came during interviews with Fox News or \uc2 CNN\uc2 , not during his campaign rallies. For two weeks, Trump has been reading prepared remarks from a teleprompter, a machine he had long cursed. As the week progressed, his control slipped and he went off-script more often - saying at a rally in Ohio on Monday that some urban areas are more dangerous than war zones and making a joke in Tampa on Wednesday about Clinton being medicated.\par \par \uc2 This week the campaign twice started to plan an event where Trump could give an immigration speech - an opportunity for him to settle on a position and document it - only to cancel without a clear explanation.\par \par \uc2 By Wednesday, Coulter seemed confident again in Trump's candidacy as she attended a book party in Washington and told Bloomberg News's \uc2 Joshua Green\uc2 : "My worship for him is like the people of North Korea worship their Dear Leader - blind loyalty. Once he gave that Mexican rapist speech, I'll walk across glass for him. That's basically it. ... I'll criticize him, and I have, but it's all minor stylistic stuff. We all want to shoot him at various times."\par \par \uc2 Thursday, Trump took a different tone in an interview with \uc2 CNN\uc2 's Anderson Cooper and said that he foresees "a lot of people being deported," although he admitted such deportations could not all happen at once. Trump also doubled down on the notion that a majority of illegal immigrants are violent criminals who will be the first to go.\par \par \uc2 "And there are probably millions of them, but certainly hundreds of thousands," he said. "Big numbers. They're out. They're out."\par \par \uc2 At one point, Cooper asked Trump, "So if you haven't committed a crime and you've been here for 15 years, and you have a family here, you have a job here, will you be deported?"\par \par \uc2 "We're going to see what happens once we strengthen up our border," Trump replied, describing that strength in detail. "And then we're going to see what happens. But there is a very good chance the answer could be yes. We're going to see what happens."\par \par \uc2 jenna.johnson@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 robert.costa@washpost.com \par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com\par \par \uc2 WP20160827trumpweek0827\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020160827ec8r0002k\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Illegal immigrants can be deported, especially if they commit a crime. But if their crime is not a "crime involving moral turpitude," then they can ask the Justice Department to exercise its discretion to keep them from being deported (for instance, because they have lived here a long time, their record is otherwise clean, their children are U.S. citizens, and so on). If it is a crime involving moral turpitude, then they can't get such discretionary relief. You might like this rule, or prefer either a more \uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2 -friendly or a more \uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2 -hostile rule. But that's the rule that Congress has created.\par \par \uc2 But what does "crime involving moral turpitude" mean? For instance, is using a false Social Security number a crime of moral turpitude? Wednesday's 7th Circuit decision in Arias v. Lynch suggests that some such uses aren't crimes of moral turpitude; crimes involving "moral turpitude," the court concludes, are crimes that are "inherently base, vile, or depraved," and\par \par \uc2 It seems inconsistent with the terms "base, vile, or depraved" to hold that an unauthorized immigrant who uses a false social security number so that she can hold a job, pay taxes, and support her family would be guilty of a crime involving moral turpitude, while an unauthorized immigrant who is paid solely in cash under the table and does not pay any taxes would not necessarily be guilty of a crime involving moral turpitude. A rule that all crimes that involve any element of deception categorically involve moral turpitude would produce results at odds with the accepted definition of moral turpitude as conduct that is "inherently base, vile, or depraved." At the same time, there is significant precedent indicating that deceptive conduct is morally turpitudinous.\par \par \uc2 The court, though, does not "try to resolve this conflict definitively in this case," because it concludes that the Board of Immigration Appeals has to reevaluate its rule for applying the "involving moral turpitude" standard in light of a 2015 attorney general decision. So the 7th Circuit doesn't squarely decide whether to go with the 5th and 8th Circuits (which have held that use of false Social Security numbers is a crime involving moral turpitude) or the 9th Circuit (which has held the opposite).\par \par \uc2 If you think that there's something dicey about a statute that involves such a vague term, with so much at stake, you're not alone: Judge Posner wrote a long concurring opinion sharply condemning the "moral turpitude" standard. "It is preposterous that that stale, antiquated, and, worse, meaningless phrase should continue to be a part of American law." "What does 'inherently base, vile, or depraved' -- words that have virtually dropped from the vocabulary of modern Americans -- mean \u8230\'20\'26 ?" And Judge Posner concludes that, given that the test is the law, it should at least be limited in cases like this to false statements aimed at fraudulently getting money, and not to deception generally: "Although convicted of a crime against the government, the petitioner \u8230\'20\'26 was not seeking any money from the government. So far as appears her crime harmed no one, least of all the government though it is the 'victim' of her crime." (She was using a made-up number, not the number of someone else.)\par \par \uc2 Of course, whether the crime indeed "harmed no one" depends a lot on your view of work by illegal immigrants, and whether it indeed harms the American citizens and permanent residents with whom they are competing. I take it, though, that Judge Posner's response would be that the "moral turpitude" standard requires courts to make such judgments based on their own sense of what qualifies as sufficiently harmful behavior; and if Congress disagrees, and wants to mandate deportation of all illegal immigrants, or of all illegal immigrants who use false Social Security numbers, it should say so clearly.\par \par \uc2 Thanks to Howard Bashman (How Appealing) and Dan Klau (Appeallingly Brief!) for the pointer.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020160826ec8q0066a\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 the-fix\par {\*\bkmkstart toc34}{\*\bkmkend toc34}\b \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 's moment of racial reckoning has arrived ; It seems Trump may have finally realized just who America, circa 2016, really is.\b0\par\par\uc2 By Janell Ross \par \uc2 1,132 \uc2 words\par \uc2 26 August 2016\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 , the man who announced his White House bid with a speech that called illegal immigrants "rapists" and said in that same speech "they are bringing drugs, they are bringing crime"; who has throughout the election implied a Mexican government conspiracy to send the dregs of that society north; who gave speeches conjuring images of a Trump administration storm-trooper force removing 11.2 million undocumented from the United States, no exceptions ... has decided to soften his stance on immigration.\par \par \uc2 Trump told Fox News this week that, like the Obama administration, a Trump-led government would focus federal immigration enforcement activity on the subset of undocumented immigrants who commit crimes inside the United States. This, Trump said, has been all that Obama needed to dispatch "a lot of people." The Trump flourish: He'll do it with "more energy."\u160\'00\'A0Right now, it's light on details. But it certainly doesn't sound as if\u160\'00\'A0there's a muscular and mass \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  roundup in there.\par \par \uc2 That, America, is what a political reversal born of a demographic reckoning sounds like.\par \par \uc2 Of course, Trump and his campaign staff have worked hard this week to call it something else. That's fine and to be expected.\u160\'00\'A0But this remains true: Trump is the candidate who made stopping illegal immigration and deporting all of the nation's \u160\'00\'A011.2 million undocumented immigrants his political raison d'\u234\'00\'EAtre.\par \par \uc2 So why would \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  even imply that his ideas on immigration are changing or have changed or will not amount to a blunt instrument molded in the image of "Operation Wetback," as he led primary voters to believe? Well, the reason amounts to a matter of plain mathematical sense and the very human stories that population data contain.\par \par \uc2 Trump's numbers-savvy new campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, has almost certainly acquainted Trump with a reality that he may not have noticed in his tour of large venues filled with sometimes-raucous, overwhelmingly white crowds.\u160\'00\'A0This is a country where in late 2014, the New Republic gave one of the nation's lead demographers, the \uc2 Brookings Institution\uc2 's William Frey, some space to write. What he published amounted to this: There's ample evidence that\u160\'00\'A0"post-white America" is already here. Got that? It is not pending, in many practical ways that matter right now. A more diverse America with theoretically equal political power has arrived.\par \par \uc2 Let's break this down to its essence with the help of census data.\par \par \uc2 In 1980, the country's population looked like this:\par \par \uc2 By 2015, it looked like this:\par \par \uc2 In 1980, this is what the American electorate and its voting activity looked like.\par \par \uc2 In 2012, the most recent presidential election year and a period therefore indicative of what we are likely to see come November, this is what the American electorate and voting activity looked like.\par \par \uc2 This is how all of the phenomena above combined to shape presidential politics over the past 20 years.\par \par \uc2 Finally, in the four years since \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2  lost a chance at the White House \u8212\'20\'14 at least in part because of\u160\'00\'A0his support for concepts like "self deportation" and assumptions that he could just say something different in the general election \u8212\'20\'14 the population and the American electorate haven't\u160\'00\'A0stopped changing.\par \par \uc2 Take note of the fine print, too: This chart does not even include Native American and biracial voters, who also lean heavily toward Democrats. By some estimates, there are about 9.1 million new white voters who could participate in 2016 and 7 million total voters of color. Some of those white voters will lean Republican. Some will not. Almost all of those voters of color will not.\par \par \uc2 Identity shapes experience; therefore, it continues to shape our politics. That is why there are so many voters of color who back the same party, and the same is true of white voters. Don't expect that to change until identity-related imbalances in pay for the same work, access to lower-quality health care, schools and other public facilities, more frequent and disproportionately perilous contact with police and higher-cost borrowing for homes, cars and businesses disappear.\par \par \uc2 Another major identity-related force in modern presidential politics is this. Many voters of color and some white one,s too \u8212\'20\'14 not just Latinos\u160\'00\'A0\u8212\'20\'14 have formed mixed-status families. These are households in which\u160\'00\'A0U.S. citizens \u8212\'20\'14 naturalized and natural-born \u8212\'20\'14 undocumented and documented immigrants form families. There are at least 9 million people who by virtue of their direct emotional, genetic and economic ties to undocumented immigrants aren't going to find the way that Trump has spent the bulk of his campaign talking about roundups easy to overlook.\par \par \uc2 But here is the real takeaway from all those numbers and charts.\par \par \uc2 Both the share of the total population and the total electorate that is white is shrinking. However, while voters of color have become a bigger part of the electorate and voted with increasing strength and consistency for decades, white voters have not. This is particularly true for low-income white voters, an important part of the Republican base. There are likely a number of reasons for this; among the many things that the Republican Party will have to sort out in the 2016 election and beyond is what the party's platform will need to include to bring these voters back.\par \par \uc2 Trump has been lauded by a lot of Republicans for mounting a campaign that \u8212\'20\'14\u160\'00\'A0at least at his rallies and events \u8212\'20\'14 seems to have engaged people who are not particularly concerned about corporate tax rates or inheritance penalties. Trump voters, many a reporter has said\u160\'00\'A0this cycle, are driven by economic anxiety. A massive August report released by Gallup shows that's probably not strictly true. A good portion of what drives Trump voters is their sense of lost social dominance and the ability to bequeath all that can come with this to their children. And\u160\'00\'A0there have been other studies that strongly hinted at the same.\par \par \uc2 Translation: The country and its composition have changed dramatically. And Trump followers\u160\'00\'A0do not like it at all, hence their attraction to Trump's hard line on immigration and what some might, at the very least, describe as a whole range of exclusionary policy ideas.\par \par \uc2 Still, all that anxiety or anger or whatever is not enough. Emotions do not trump votes.\par \par \uc2 This may well be obvious to a lot of people. But\u160\'00\'A0human beings who vote \u8212\'20\'14 based in large part on those identity-related experiences \u8212\'20\'14 are going to decide this election. It seems Trump may have finally realized just who America, circa 2016, really is.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020160824ec8o006bu\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 As \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  continues to weigh the pros and cons of forcefully deporting the roughly 11 million immigrants living illegally in the United States, he turned to the resource that has been his most reliable\u160\'00\'A0adviser throughout his\u160\'00\'A0tumultuous presidential campaign: the polls.\par \par \uc2 "I'll ask the audience," Trump said Tuesday during an immigration-focused town hall in Austin that was hosted by Fox News\u160\'00\'A0and broadcast on Wednesday night.\u160\'00\'A0"You have somebody who is terrific, who has been here ... a long time. A long court proceeding, long everything, okay? In other words, to get them out, can we go through a process or do you think they have to get out? Tell me. I mean, I don't know. You tell me. I want to know."\par \par \uc2 Fox News's Sean Hannity, who was moderating the event, jumped in to help execute this spur-of-the-moment poll, asking the crowd: "How\u160\'00\'A0many think they should go?"\par \par \uc2 The crowd loudly cheered, and it was unclear if that was the reaction Trump wanted or not, as his exact position on mass deportations has become murky.\par \par \uc2 "Do it again. Do it again," Trump said. "So, let me ask you, because this is like, this place is packed.\u160\'00\'A0Does everybody get this kind of a crowd?"\par \par \uc2 "No," Hannity told Trump with a laugh. "No."\par \par \uc2 Trump then posed his question to the crowd for a second time\u160\'00\'A0and made\u160\'00\'A0the\u160\'00\'A0theoretical \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  someone the crowd could more easily sympathize with: "You have somebody that has been in the country for 20 years. He has done a great job, has a job, everything else, okay? Do we take him and the family \u8212\'20\'14 her or him or whatever \u8212\'20\'14 and send them out?"\par \par \uc2 "No!" some people in the crowd shouted.\par \par \uc2 "Or," Trump said, then laying out why that \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  might not be quite such a sympathetic case because he or she jumped the line and\u160\'00\'A0"that's a little unfair" to those who came in legally. After mulling this conundrum aloud, Trump tried his poll question a third time.\par \par \uc2 "So do we tell these people to get out, No. 1, or do we work with them and let them stay in some cases," Trump said, as the crowd broke into\u160\'00\'A0shouting.\par \par \uc2 It was impossible to know who wanted what.\u160\'00\'A0Trump decided to set a baseline and ask a question that everyone could agree on.\par \par \uc2 "So the bad ones? The gang members, all of them, what do you think?" Trump said as the crowd cheered the deportation of immigrants who have broken the law. "Does anybody disagree on the gang members?"\par \par \uc2 The crowd responded in unison: "Noooo!"\par \par \uc2 "Is there one person?" Trump said. "Yeah, there's a gang member over there. Okay, there is one person?"\par \par \uc2 Trump then told\u160\'00\'A0the crowd of the one deportation position that he has committed to: quickly deporting all illegal immigrants who have committed a crime, although he has not said how severe of a crime it must be.\par \par \uc2 "They're going to be gone like so fast your head will spin," Trump said. "Okay? So that's easy."\par \par \uc2 Trump then returned to the not-so-easy question facing him and conducted a fifth poll.\par \par \uc2 "So, now we have the person \u8212\'20\'14\u160\'00\'A020 years been an upstanding person, the family is great, everyone is great," Trump said. "Do we throw them out or do we work with them?"\par \par \uc2 Trump gave two clear voting options: "No. 1, we'll say: Throw out. No. 2, we work with them. Ready? No. 1."\par \par \uc2 The crowd cheered and clapped.\par \par \uc2 "No. 2," Trump said.\par \par \uc2 The crowd again cheered and clapped a bit louder,\u160\'00\'A0seeming to suggest more\u160\'00\'A0support for not deporting all 11 million people.\par \par \uc2 Hannity then interrupted\u160\'00\'A0Trump's game-show-style poll and tried to bring the conversation back to what the candidate himself believes.\par \par \uc2 Hannity repeated Trump's position back to him for confirmation: Originally, Trump said "they're all out and there was a big brouhaha" but now the candidate is "sort of indicating that there will be some flexibility" for immigrants who have been in the country for a long time and are upstanding citizens.\par \par \uc2 "But here's the big question, though," Hannity said.\par \par \uc2 "Go ahead," Trump said with a sigh.\par \par \uc2 "No citizenship?" Hannity asked.\par \par \uc2 "No citizenship," Trump said, as the crowd clapped. "No citizenship."\par \par \uc2 Hannity then turned to crowd: "Everyone\u160\'00\'A0agree with that?"\par \par \uc2 The crowd loudly cheered \u8212\'20\'14 perhaps it was as loud as they cheered\u160\'00\'A0for that winning option seconds earlier but, frankly, the whole room was\u160\'00\'A0cheering for everything Trump was saying without much measurable difference.\par \par \uc2 "Let me go a step further," Trump said. "They will pay back taxes. They have to pay taxes. There's no amnesty as such. There's no amnesty. But we work with them."\par \par \uc2 Trump then tried polling the audience a seventh\u160\'00\'A0time, again describing an immigrant with a family who has "been here for 15 or 20 years."\par \par \uc2 "Look, this is like a poll," Trump said. "There's thousands of people in this room. Who wants those people thrown out?"\par \par \uc2 A man in the audience bellowed: "I do!"\par \par \uc2 "Well, who wants them, who wants them?" Trump said, searching for support for a position that he once criticized. "Who's the guy who wants them thrown out? ...\u160\'00\'A0Stand up, stand up!"\par \par \uc2 The camera panned to a yelling man with white hair wearing a T-shirt over a dress shirt. Others could be seen standing and shouting while most of the audience sat and listened to the sound of conflicted division.\par \par \uc2 Trump tried the poll an eighth\u160\'00\'A0time.\par \par \uc2 "So who wants to \u8212\'20\'14 by the way, no amnesty, no citizenship, et cetera \u8212\'20\'14 who doesn't want them thrown out?" Trump said. "Who does not want them thrown out?"\par \par \uc2 As the crowd cheered, Hannity again tried to bring it back to Trump.\par \par \uc2 "Mr. Trump, that raises a really\u160\'00\'A0important question. ... What does your gut tell you you want to do?" Hannity said.\par \par \uc2 "Well, look, this is like a poll, this is like a poll," said Trump, whose whole candidacy has revolved around poll numbers, which lately have fallen out of his favor. "And I love that guy that stood up and said \u8212\'20\'14 where is that guy? I love this guy. This is my guy."\par \par \uc2 Trump's stubborn\u160\'00\'A0opposition to illegal immigration was at the heart of his unexpected success in the Republican primaries, and he earned the loyalty of conservatives who appreciated his political incorrectness. Trump was the guy who told his fellow Republican candidates to speak English, not Spanish, and mocked those who tried to approach immigration reform\u160\'00\'A0with empathy. He embraced\u160\'00\'A0immigration positions that had long existed at the fringes of the Republican Party, opposing birthright citizenship, calling for the construction of a wall on the southern border and promising to deport all 11 million immigrants illegally in the country.\par \par \uc2 But suddenly in the past few days, Trump has started to sound like those establishment Republicans, the senators and governors who insisted months ago during the primary that immigration reform was an issue the party had to embrace and should embrace.\par \par \uc2 "I mean, I get it. I get it. And I understand what you're saying," Trump said, talking directly to\u160\'00\'A0the supporter who stood to yell, subtly reminding the nominee\u160\'00\'A0of the risks of\u160\'00\'A0dramatically changing his position. "But this is sort of like a poll, and this is what I'm getting all over the country. ... We're going to come out with a decision very soon."\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020160825ec8p001e1\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 As \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  continues to wrestle with how he would treat the millions of immigrants illegally living in the United States, he has made a series of comments\u160\'00\'A0indicating\u160\'00\'A0that he might be okay with some of them staying, which would be a major deviation from his earlier stance of wanting mass deportations.\par \par \uc2 Trump's\u160\'00\'A0latest such comment came in an interview with Fox News Channel's Sean Hannity that is set to air on Wednesday night and was\u160\'00\'A0released Wednesday afternoon\u160\'00\'A0by the network.\par \par \uc2 "No citizenship," Trump said when asked whether he would allow an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  to stay in the country if he or she proves to be a fair citizen. "Let me go a step further: They'll pay back taxes, they have to pay taxes. There's no amnesty, as such, there's no amnesty, but we work with them. Now, everybody agrees we get the bad ones out. But when I go through and I meet thousands and thousands of people on this subject, and I've had very strong people come up to me, really great, great people come up to me, and they've said, 'Mr. Trump, I love you, but to take a person who's been here for 15 or 20 years and throw them and their family out, it's so tough, Mr. Trump,' I have it all the time! It's a very, very hard thing."\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020160824ec8o00795\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

But he has given some clues.\b0\par\par\uc2 By Aaron Blake \par \uc2 946 \uc2 words\par \uc2 24 August 2016\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Update: During a town hall with Sean Hannity recorded Tuesday night, Trump expanded further, saying he might\u160\'00\'A0"soften" the laws\u160\'00\'A0for illegal immigrants who have contributed to society.\par \par \uc2 Hannity asked:\u160\'00\'A0"Is there any part of the law that you might be able to change that would accommodate those people that contribute to society, have been law-abiding, have kids here?"\par \par \uc2 "There certainly can be a softening, because we're not looking to hurt people," Trump said, according to excerpts provided by Fox News. "We want people -- we have some great people in this country. We have some great, great people in this country. So, but we're going to follow the laws of this country."\par \par \uc2 It marks\u160\'00\'A0his most direct comment when it comes to not deporting every \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , as he previously proposed, and potentially creating a path to legal status.\u160\'00\'A0 Below, we look at Trump's previous appearance on Fox, in which he also hinted at a softer approach but didn't clearly state it.\par \par \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 , it turns out, isn't rolling out his immigration proposal Thursday. But he's clearly still thinking about what he'll propose.\par \par \uc2 Reports over the weekend indicated that Trump was softening his language on what to do with the estimated 11 million immigrants living illegally in the United States \u8212\'20\'14 and was perhaps even open to legalizing some of them. And we in the media noted the potential flip-flop this would represent from the man who previously promised to deport all 11 million.\par \par \uc2 So what might Trump announce in his plan \u8212\'20\'14 whenever he does announce it? He spoke to Bill O'Reilly about it Monday night, and a few clues can be gleaned.\par \par \uc2 In short: He's not talking about mass deportation anymore. Instead, he's talking about deporting "bad" illegal immigrants and leaving unspecified what he'd do with the rest.\par \par \uc2 Here's the transcript, with our emphasis and analysis:\par \par \uc2 O'REILLY:\u160\'00\'A0The media, as you know, are running wild with this. Are you really rethinking your mass-deportation strategy?\par \par \uc2 This is Trump deflecting and filibustering and trying to avoid the heart of the matter: mass deportation. But here and elsewhere, his campaign has pointedly\u160\'00\'A0declined the opportunity to double down on mass deportation. His campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, said over the weekend that Trump's\u160\'00\'A0stance on it\u160\'00\'A0was "to be determined."\par \par \uc2 So no firm answer here, but there\u160\'00\'A0are a few big take-aways: 1. He\u160\'00\'A0wants to "follow the law" and 2. He will definitely deport "the bad ones."\par \par \uc2 This last point is key. Trump seems to be making a distinction between "the bad ones" and other undocumented immigrants. But under his\u160\'00\'A0old plan, there really was no distinction until after the deportation had taken place.\par \par \uc2 "We have at least 11 million people in this country that came in illegally," he said at a February debate. "They will go out. They will come back \u8212\'20\'14 some will come back, the best, through a process. They have to come back legally."\par \par \uc2 Trump suggests the non-"bad ones" will "go through the process," but he doesn't make at all clear whether that process involves deportation. Previously, the process\u160\'00\'A0was that they would be deported and then could come back through the regular process. Now, he seems to contrast his deportation of the "bad ones"\u160\'00\'A0with how the others would be treated. That suggests that perhaps they wouldn't be deported at all.\par \par \uc2 O'REILLY: Okay. But here's what everybody wants to know \u8212\'20\'14\par \par \uc2 Again, Trump seems to be softening his stance without committing to anything firm. But if he\u160\'00\'A0is truly going to deport millions of illegal immigrants, it isn't clear how he\u160\'00\'A0would avoid putting them in detention centers. These are people, after all, who have been living largely outside the system and avoiding law enforcement.\par \par \uc2 Allowing them to stay "in their homes," as O'Reilly grants Trump, doesn't seem practical for deportation purposes \u8212\'20\'14\u160\'00\'A0but perhaps it does for legalization.\par \par \uc2 Then again, Trump could simply have not really thought this all through and is just doubling down on his long-standing claim that all this would be done in a "humane" manner.\par \par \uc2 O'REILLY: Well, you cited Dwight Eisenhower \u8212\'20\'14\u160\'00\'A0Mr. Trump, you cited Dwight Eisenhower on this program.\par \par \uc2 Trump is being extremely cryptic here, but it's worth noting that he seems less approving of "Operation Wetback" than he previously did. In a November debate, Trump repeatedly mentioned how good a guy Eisenhower was while discussing the program.\par \par \uc2 "Let me just tell you that Dwight Eisenhower \u8212\'20\'14 good president, great president, people liked him. 'I like Ike,' right, the expression, 'I like Ike' \u8212\'20\'14 moved 1.5 million illegal immigrants out of this country," Trump said. "Dwight Eisenhower. You don't get nicer. You don't get friendlier. They moved a 1.5 million out. We have no choice. We have no choice."\par \par \uc2 As for the end of Trump's comments \u8212\'20\'14 "go through the process," "perhaps with a lot more energy," but "through the system of laws" \u8212\'20\'14 they mean very little by themselves. Would Trump be abiding by the law if he created a new process through which undocumented immigrants could be legalized? Sure. Is he talking about the existing process or a new one? Who knows. And what the heck does "with a lot more energy" mean?\par \par \uc2 In the end, we probably aren't the only ones who don't know what Trump's proposal will be. He probably doesn't even know it himself.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020160823ec8n005k1\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 plum-line\par {\*\bkmkstart toc38}{\*\bkmkend toc38}\b \uc2 Trump's challenge: How to sell deportations to suburban swing voters ; Trump's new immigration rhetoric, translated.\b0\par\par\uc2 By Greg Sargent \par \uc2 861 \uc2 words\par \uc2 23 August 2016\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 There's a lot of confusion out there about where \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  stands on immigration. Bill O'Reilly did a reasonably good job of trying to pin Trump down last night, and revealed some important things about just how fraudulent Trump's analysis of our immigration mess really is, but there's still a good deal to clarify about his own stance.\par \par \uc2 So, if I were fortunate enough to score a major interview with Trump, I would ask him this simple question:\par \par \uc2 You have made a distinction between undocumented immigrants who are serious criminals, and those you view as "the good ones." If you are elected president, is there any scenario under which the latter group will be able to get on a path to legal status, without leaving the country first?\par \par \uc2 If Trump says Yes, then the question is: How would you do that? (Trump won't say Yes.) If Trump says No, or even if he declines to answer directly, and says (as he has before) that all the "good ones" can come back if they leave first, the next questions for him are:\par \par \uc2 Okay, does that mean you will take concrete steps -- such as stepping up deportation raids and asking Congress to appropriate enormous sums of money -- to expedite the deportations of all those here illegally? Or will you continue to carry out deportations in proportion with current funding levels -- which only permit for the removal of a fraction of the undocumented population? If it's the latter, and you prioritize the removal of the most serious criminals first, what will happen to the rest in the interim? Will they simply remain in the shadows? For how long? Is the goal to get them to self-deport?\par \par \uc2 These questions will also be relevant if Trump does eventually give a speech clarifying his stance. As of now, Trump has said that under current law (meaning under current funding levels), we should prioritize the removals of serious criminals. But he has not said what should happen to all the rest -- he would leave them subject to deportation later.\par \par \uc2 In one sense, Trump is essentially sanitizing his mass deportations stance. Frank Sharry of America's Voice emailed me some thoughts on Trump's latest, arguing that he isn't really changing his position in any meaningful sense:\par \par \uc2 Kellyanne Conway wants to get suburbanites who don't want to vote for a racist, especially women, to come home. They've figured out that Trump's mass deportation stance is an impediment to that (something tons of polling confirms). But Trump is so identified with a hard line on the issue with his base, he (with her guidance) is trying to shed the mass deportation label (unpopular) with an approach that emphasizes enforcing current law, protecting wages of Americans and doing it in an undefined "fair and humane" way.\par \par \uc2 If this is right -- and I think it probably is -- then the goal of his new formula is to let the hard core Trumpist base know that he is fully committed to removing all undocumented immigrants, while simultaneously repackaging the process necessary to accomplish that end in a manner that is more acceptable to suburban swing voters. As Sharry notes, this accomplishes both of these ends.\par \par \uc2 As Brian Beutler explains, Trump is not budging off the idea that all illegal immigrants are nothing more than criminals who can never be assimilated here. He's simply trying to make the response he's proposing sound a bit more humane so it doesn't alienate whites who aren't hostile towards illegal immigrants -- or at least see the moral and practical complexities their situations present -- but not so humane, forgiving and (gasp!!!) assimilationist that it alienates core base voters.\par \par \uc2 Trump's answer: We won't unleash a jack-booted Trumpian Deportation Force and we'll start by only getting tough on the worst criminals that everyone agrees must go (don't worry, swing voters); but still, all undocumented immigrants remain subject to removal and will not be placed on a path to legalization without leaving the country first (don't worry, restrictionist Trumpkin base); and yet you should rest assured, Trump loves Good Undocumented Immigrants and they will be able to get right with the law by coming back later (don't worry, swing voters); but in the real world that is very unlikely to happen (don't worry, restrictionist Trumpkin base).\par \par \uc2 Indeed, it's revealing that hard-core immigration hawks are not hearing anything alarming in Trump's new rhetoric. As one of them told Bloomberg's Sahil Kapur, there isn't much daylight between mass deportations and his current stance, because Trump still remains committed to solving the problem as restrictionists define it: "how we shrink the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  population, how we get them to leave."\par \par \uc2 This is still how Trump defines the problem, too, and restrictionists see the wink in Trump's new rhetoric. Hopefully the next person who scores an interview with Trump can pin that down with more clarity.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020160823ec8n005mv\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

There was no controversy.\b0\par\par\uc2 By Aaron Blake \par \uc2 3,786 \uc2 words\par \uc2 19 August 2016\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  delivered his best speech of the 2016 campaign on Thursday night in Charlotte\par \par \uc2 While previous attempts for Trump to get on-message and use prepared remarks have fallen flat -- mostly because Trump clearly wasn't into it -- his speech\u160\'00\'A0Thursday provided\u160\'00\'A0the kind of broadly appealing, focused and animated Trump that his advisers and GOP leaders will want to be seeing lots more of in the next two and a half months. The word "pivot" has been beaten to death in this campaign, but this is the closest we've come to the real thing.\par \par \uc2 Below is a transcript -- the first half drawn from Trump's prepared remarks and the second half an actual transcript of what he said -- and our annotations.\par \par \uc2 (And remember:\u160\'00\'A0You can annotate too by signing up for Genius.\u160\'00\'A0To see an annotation, click or tap the highlighted part of the transcript.\par \par \uc2 Thank you. It's great to be here in Charlotte. I just met with our many amazing employees right up the road at our property.\par \par \uc2 I'd like to take a moment to talk about the heartbreak and devastation in Louisiana, a state that is very special to me.\par \par \uc2 We are one nation. When one state hurts, we all hurt \u8212\'20\'14 and we must all work together to lift each other up. Working, building, restoring together.\par \par \uc2 Our prayers are with the families who have lost loved ones, and we send them our deepest condolences. Though words cannot express the sadness one feels at times like this, I hope everyone in Louisiana knows that our country is praying for them and standing with them to help them in these difficult hours.\par \par \uc2 We are one country, one people, and we will have together one great future.\par \par \uc2 Tonight, I'd like to talk about the New American Future we are going to create together.\par \par \uc2 Last week, I laid out my plan to bring jobs back to our country.\par \par \uc2 On Monday, I laid out my plan to defeat Radical Islamic Terrorism.\par \par \uc2 On Tuesday, in Wisconsin, I talked about how we are going to restore law and order to this country.\par \par \uc2 Let me take this opportunity to extend our thanks and our gratitude to the police and law enforcement officers in this country who have sacrificed so greatly in these difficult times.\par \par \uc2 The chaos and violence on our streets, and the assaults on law enforcement, are an attack against all peaceful citizens. If I am elected President, this chaos and violence will end \u8212\'20\'14 and it will end very quickly.\par \par \uc2 Every single citizen in our land has a right to live in safety.\par \par \uc2 To be one united nation, we must protect all of our people. But we must also provide opportunities for all of our people.\par \par \uc2 We cannot make America Great Again if we leave any community behind.\par \par \uc2 Nearly Four in ten African-American children are living in poverty.I will not rest until children of every color in this country are fully included in the American Dream.\par \par \uc2 Jobs, safety, opportunity. Fair and equal representation. This is what I promise to African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and all Americans.\par \par \uc2 But to achieve this New American Future we must break from the failures of the past.\par \par \uc2 As you know, I am not a politician. I have worked in business, creating jobs and rebuilding neighborhoods my entire adult life. I've never wanted to use the language of the insiders, and I've never been politically correct \u8212\'20\'14 it takes far too much time, and can often make more difficult.\par \par \uc2 Sometimes, in the heat of debate and speaking on a multitude of issues, you don't choose the right words or you say the wrong thing. I have done that, and I regret it, particularly where it may have caused personal pain. Too much is at stake for us to be consumed with these issues.\par \par \uc2 But one thing I can promise you is this: I will always tell you the truth.\par \par \uc2 I speak the truth for all of you, and for everyone in this country who doesn't have a voice.\par \par \uc2 I speak the truth on behalf of the factory worker who lost his or her job.\par \par \uc2 I speak the truth on behalf of the Veteran who has been denied the medical care they need \u8212\'20\'14 and so many are not making it. They are dying.\par \par \uc2 I speak the truth on behalf of the family living near the border that deserves to be safe in their own country but is instead living with no security at all.\par \par \uc2 Our campaign is about representing the great majority of Americans \u8212\'20\'14 Republicans, Democrats, Independents, Conservatives and Liberals \u8212\'20\'14 who read the newspaper, or turn on the TV, and don't hear anyone speaking for them. All they hear are insiders fighting for insiders.\par \par \uc2 These are the forgotten men and women in our society, and they are angry at so much on so many levels. The poverty, the unemployment, the failing schools, the jobs moving to other countries.\par \par \uc2 I am fighting for these forgotten Americans.\par \par \uc2 Fourteen months ago, I declared my campaign for the Presidency on the promise to give our government back to the people. Every day since then, I've worked to repay the loyalty and the faith that you have put in me.\par \par \uc2 Every day I think about how much is at stake for this country. This isn't just the fight of my life, it's the fight of our lives \u8212\'20\'14 together \u8212\'20\'14 to save our country.\par \par \uc2 I refuse to let another generation of American children be excluded from the American Dream. Our whole country loses when young people of limitless potential are denied the opportunity to contribute their talents because we failed to provide them the opportunities they deserved. Let our children be dreamers too.\par \par \uc2 Our whole country loses every time a kid doesn't graduate from high school, or fails to enter the workforce or, worse still, is lost to the dreadful world of drugs and crime.\par \par \uc2 When I look at the failing schools, the terrible trade deals, and the infrastructure crumbling in our inner cities, I know all of this can be fixed - and it can be fixed very quickly.\par \par \uc2 In the world I come from, if something is broken, you fix it.\par \par \uc2 If something isn't working, you replace it.\par \par \uc2 If a product doesn't deliver, you make a change.\par \par \uc2 I have no patience for injustice, no tolerance for government incompetence, no sympathy for leaders who fail their citizens.\par \par \uc2 That's why I am running: to end the decades of bitter failure and to offer the American people a new future of honesty, justice and opportunity. A future where America, and its people, always \u8212\'20\'14 and I mean always \u8212\'20\'14 come first.\par \par \uc2 Aren't you tired of a system that gets rich at your expense?\par \par \uc2 Aren't you tired of the same old lies and the same old broken promises? And \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  has proven to be one of the greatest liars of all time.\par \par \uc2 Aren't you tired of arrogant leaders who look down on you, instead of serving and protecting you?\par \par \uc2 That is all about to change \u8212\'20\'14 and it's about to change soon. We are going to put the American people first again.\par \par \uc2 I've travelled all across this country laying out my bold and modern agenda for change.\par \par \uc2 In this journey, I will never lie to you. I will never tell you something I do not believe. I will never put anyone's interests ahead of yours.\par \par \uc2 And, I will never, ever stop fighting for you.\par \par \uc2 I have no special interest. I am spending millions of dollars on my own campaign \u8212\'20\'14 nobody else is.\par \par \uc2 My only interest is the American people.\par \par \uc2 So while sometimes I can be too honest, \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  is the exact opposite: she never tells the truth. One lie after another, and getting worse each passing day.\par \par \uc2 The American people are still waiting for \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  to apologize for all of the many lies she's told to them, and the many times she's betrayed them.\par \par \uc2 Tell me, has \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  ever apologized for lying about her illegal email server and deleting 33,000 emails?\par \par \uc2 Has \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  apologized for turning the State Department into a pay-for-play operation where favors are sold to the highest bidder?\par \par \uc2 Has she apologized for lying to the families who lost loved ones at Benghazi?\par \par \uc2 Has she apologized for putting Iran on the path to nuclear weapons?\par \par \uc2 Has she apologized for Iraq? For Libya? For Syria? Has she apologized for unleashing ISIS across the world?\par \par \uc2 Has \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  apologized for the decisions she made that have led to so much death, destruction and terrorism?\par \par \uc2 Speaking of lies, we now know from the State Department announcement that President Obama lied about the $400 million dollars in cash that was flown to Iran. He denied it was for the hostages, but it was. He said we don't pay ransom, but he did. He lied about the hostages \u8212\'20\'14 openly and blatantly \u8212\'20\'14 just like he lied about Obamacare.\par \par \uc2 Now the Administration has put every American travelling overseas, including our military personnel, at greater risk of being kidnapped. \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  owns President Obama's Iran policy, one more reason she can never be allowed to be President.\par \par \uc2 Let's talk about the economy. Here, in this beautiful state, so many people have suffered because of \uc2 NAFTA\uc2 . \uc2 Bill Clinton\uc2  signed the deal, and \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  supported it. North Carolina has lost nearly half of its manufacturing jobs since \uc2 NAFTA\uc2  went into effect.\par \par \uc2 Bill Clinton\uc2  also put China into the \uc2 World Trade Organization\uc2  \u8212\'20\'14 another \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 -backed deal. Your city of Charlotte has lost 1 in 4 manufacturing jobs since China joined the \uc2 WTO\uc2 , and many of these jobs were lost while \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  was Secretary of State \u8212\'20\'14 our chief diplomat with China. She was a disaster, totally unfit for the job.\par \par \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  owes the State of North Carolina a very big apology, and I think you'll get that apology around the same time you'll get to see her 33,000 deleted emails.\par \par \uc2 Another major issue in this campaign has been the border. Our open border has allowed drugs and crime and gangs to pour into our communities. So much needless suffering, so much preventable death. I've spent time with the families of wonderful Americans whose loved ones were killed by the open borders and Sanctuary Cities that \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  supports.\par \par \uc2 I've embraced the crying parents who've lost their children to violence spilling across our border. Parents like Laura Wilkerson and Michelle Root and Sabine Durden and Jamiel Shaw whose children were killed by illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 My opponent supports Sanctuary Cities.\par \par \uc2 But where was the Sanctuary for Kate Steinle? Where was the Sanctuary for the children of Laura, Michelle, Sabine and Jamiel?\par \par \uc2 Where was the Sanctuary for every other parent who has suffered so horribly?\par \par \uc2 These moms and dads don't get a lot of consideration from our politicians. They certainly don't get apologies. They'll never even get the time of day from \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 But they will always come first to me.\par \par \uc2 Listen closely: we will deliver justice for all of these American Families. We will create a system of immigration that makes us all proud.\par \par \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 's mistakes destroy innocent lives, sacrifice national security, and betray the working families of this country.\par \par \uc2 Please remember this: I will never put personal profit before national security. I will never leave our border open to appease donors and special interests. I will never support a trade deal that kills American jobs. I will never put the special interests before the national interest. I will never put a donor before a voter, or a lobbyist before a citizen.\par \par \uc2 Instead, I will be a champion for the people.\par \par \uc2 The establishment media doesn't cover what really matters in this country, or what's really going on in people's lives. They will take words of mine out of context and spend a week obsessing over every single syllable, and then pretend to discover some hidden meaning in what I said.\par \par \uc2 Just imagine for a second if the media spent this energy holding the politicians accountable who got innocent Americans like Kate Steinle killed \u8212\'20\'14 she was gunned down by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who had been deported five times.\par \par \uc2 Just imagine if the media spent time and lots of time investigating the poverty and joblessness of the inner cities. Just think about how much different things would be if the media in this country sent their cameras to our border, to our closing factories, or to our failing schools.\par \par \uc2 Or if the media focused on what dark streets must be hidden in the 33,000 emails that \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  illegally deleted.\par \par \uc2 Thank you. Instead every story is told from the perspective of the insider. It's the narrative of the people who rig the system, never the voice of the people it's been rigged against. Believe me. So many people suffering for so long in silence. No cameras. No coverage, no outrage from the media class that seems to get outrage over just about everything else. So, again, it's not about me. It's never been about me. It's been about all the people in this country who don't have a voice. I am running to be your voice.\par \par \uc2 Thank you. I'm running to be the voice for every forgotten part of this country that has been waiting and hoping for a better future.\par \par \uc2 I am glad that I make the powerful, and I mean very powerful a little uncomfortable now and again, including some of the powerful people, frankly, in my own party because it means that I'm fighting for real change, real change. There is a reason hedge fund managers, the financial lobbyists, the Wall Street investors are throwing their money all over \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  because they know she will make sure the system stays rigged in their favor.\par \par \uc2 It's the powerful protecting the powerful. The insiders fighting for the insiders. I am fighting for you.\par \par \uc2 Here is the change I propose. On terrorism, we are going to end the era of nation-building and, instead, focus on destroying, destroying, destroying ISIS and radical Islamic terrorism.\par \par \uc2 We will use military, cyber, and financial warfare and work with any partner in the world and the Middle East that shares our goal in defeating terrorism. I have a message for the terrorists trying to kill our citizens. We will find you, we will destroy you and we will absolutely win and we will win soon.\par \par \uc2 On immigration, we will temporarily suspend immigration from any place where adequate screening cannot be performed, extreme vetting. Remember, extreme vetting. All applicants for immigration will be vetted for ties to radical ideology. And we will screen out anyone who doesn't share our values and love our people.\par \par \uc2 Anyone who believes Sharia Law supplants American law will not be given an immigrant visa.\par \par \uc2 If you want to join our society, then you must embrace our society. Our values, and our tolerant way of life. Those who believe in oppressing women, guys, Hispanics, African-Americans, and people of different faiths are not welcome to join our great country.\par \par \uc2 We will promote our American values, our American way of life, and our American system of government, which are all, all the best in the world. My opponent on the other hand wants a 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees even more than already pouring into our country under President Obama. Her plan would bring in roughly 620,000 refugees from all refugee sending nations in her first term alone on top of all other immigration. Think of that. Think of that. What are we doing?\par \par \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  is running to be America's \uc2 Angela Merkel\uc2  and we have seen how much crime and how many problems that's caused the German people and Germany.\par \par \uc2 We have enough problems already, we do not need more. On crime we're going to add more police, more investigators, and appoint the best judges and prosecutors in the world.\par \par \uc2 We will pursue strong enforcement of federal laws. The gangs and cartels. And criminal syndicates terrorizing our people will be stripped apart one by one and they will be sent out of our country quickly. Their day is over. And it's going to end very, very fast. Our trade -- thank you. On trade, we're going to renegotiate \uc2 NAFTA\uc2  to make it better and if they don't agree, we will withdraw.\par \par \uc2 And likewise we are going to withdraw from Transpacific Partnership, another disaster.\par \par \uc2 Stand up to China on our terrible trade agreements and protect every last American job. \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  has supported all of the major trade deals that have stripped this country of its jobs and its wealth. We owe $20 trillion. On taxes, we are going to massively cut tax rates for workers and small businesses creating millions of new good paying jobs.\par \par \uc2 We're going to get rid of regulations that send jobs overseas and we are going to make it easier for young Americans to get the credit they need to start a small business and pursue their dream.\par \par \uc2 On education, so important, we are going to give students choice and allow charter schools to thrive. We are going to end tenure policies that reward bad teachers and hurt our great, good teachers. My opponent wants to deny student choice and opportunity, all to get a little bit more money from the education bureaucracy. She doesn't care how many young dreams are dashed or destroyed and they are destroyed. Young people are destroyed before they even start. We are going to work closely with African-American parents and children. We are going to work with the parents' students. We are going to work with everybody in the African-American community, in the inner cities, and what a big difference that is going to make. It's one of the things I most look forward to doing.\par \par \uc2 This means a lot to me and it's going to be a top priority in a Trump administration. On healthcare, we are going to repeal and replace the disaster called ObamaCare. Countless Americans have been forced into part- time jobs, premiums are about to jump by double digits yet again and just this week, ETNA announced it is pulling out of the exchanges all over but also in North Carolina. We are going to replace this disaster with reforms that give you choice and freedom and control in healthcare at a much, much lower cost. You will have much better healthcare at a much lower cost and it will happen quickly.\par \par \uc2 On political corruption, we are going to restore honor to our government. In my administration, I'm going to enforce all laws concerning the protection of classified information. No one will be above the law. I am going to forbid senior officials from trading favors for cash by preventing them from collecting lavish speaking fees through their spouses when they serve.\par \par \uc2 I'm going to ask my senior officials to sign an agreement not to accept speaking fees from corporations with a registered lobbyist for five years after leaving office, or from any entity tied to a foreign government.\par \par \uc2 Finally, we are going to bring our country together. It is so divided. We are going to bring it together. We are going to do it by emphasizing what we all have in common as Americans. We're going to reject bigotry and I will tell you the bigotry of \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  is amazing. She sees communities of color only as votes and not as human beings. Worthy of a better future. It's only votes. It is only votes that she sees. And she does nothing about it. She has been there forever and look at where you are. If African-Americans voters give \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  a chance by giving me their vote, the result for them will be amazing.\par \par \uc2 Look how badly things are going under decades of Democratic leadership. Look at the schools. Look at the poverty. Look at the 58 percent of young African-Americans not working. Fifty eight percent. It is it is time for a change. What do you have to lose by trying something new? I will fix it watch, I will fix it. We have nothing to lose. Nothing to lose. It is so bad. The inner cities are so bad, you have nothing to lose. They have been playing with you for 60, 70, 80 years, many, many decades. You have nothing to lose. I will do a great job.\par \par \uc2 This means so much to me. And I will work as hard as I can to bring new opportunity to places in our country which have not known it in a very, very long time. \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  and the Democratic Party have taken African-American votes totally for granted. Because the votes have been automatically there for them, there has been no reason for Democrats to produce, and they haven't. They haven't produced in decades and decades. It's time to break with the failures of the past and to fight for every last American child in this country to have a better and a much, much brighter future.\par \par \uc2 In my administration every American will be treated equally, protected equally and honored equally. We will reject bigotry and hatred and oppression in all of its forms and seek a new future built on our common culture and values as one American people.\par \par \uc2 This is the change I am promising to all of you, an honest government, a great economy, and a just society for each and every American.\par \par \uc2 But we can never ever fix our problems by relying on the same politicians who created these problems in the first place. Can't do it. Seventy two percent of voters say our country is on the wrong track. I am the change candidate. \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  is for the failed status quo to protect her special interests, her donors, her lobbyists, and others. It is time to vote for a new American future. Together, we will make America strong again. We will make America proud again, we will make America safe again. Friends and fellow citizens, come November, we will make America great again. Greater than ever before. Thank you, thank you. And God bless you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020160819ec8j003pg\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Editorial-Opinion\par {\*\bkmkstart toc40}{\*\bkmkend toc40}\b \uc2 The collapse of the Chandra Levy case demands a reassessment of jailhouse informants\b0\par\par\uc2 By Editorial Board \par \uc2 441 \uc2 words\par \uc2 5 August 2016\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 THERE WAS no DNA, no forensics, no eyewitnesses linking Ingmar Guandique to the death of Chandra Levy. Nonetheless, a jury in 2010 convicted him of murder, largely because of the testimony of a jailhouse informant. So when questions arose about the credibility of that witness, the case crumbled, with a judge first ordering a new trial and prosecutors eventually deciding to dismiss the charges. The events underscore the vulnerability \u8212\'20\'14 critics say unreliability \u8212\'20\'14 of such witnesses, and that should prompt law enforcement officials to reassess their use.\par \par \uc2 In what amounts to the latest wrinkle in a mystery that has confounded the country since 2001, when the 24-year-old intern went missing in the District, prosecutors last week asked a judge to dismiss the case against Mr.\u160\'00\'A0Guandique. Convicted in 2010, Mr.\u160\'00\'A0Guandique was set for retrial this fall when the surprise announcement was made. Citing "recent unforeseen developments," the U.S. Attorney's Office said it concluded "it can no longer prove the murder case against Mr. Guandique beyond a reasonable doubt." The move came after a woman gave authorities recordings she had secretly made with the government's star witness, a former cellmate of Mr.\u160\'00\'A0Guandique who claimed Mr.\u160\'00\'A0Guandique had confessed to Levy's murder.\par \par \uc2 It is unclear what the witness said on the tapes that prompted authorities to pull back. Also unclear is whether prosecutors still believe that Mr.\u160\'00\'A0Guandique, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  now subject to deportation proceedings, is responsible for Levy's death; if they do, their dismissal of the case raises a whole new raft of troubling questions. What is apparent is the risk involved in relying so heavily on someone who, as defense attorneys contended, may have had a motive to fabricate testimony.\par \par \uc2 No data exists on how often jailhouse informants factor into cases, but University of Virginia School of Law professor Brandon L. Garrett said they are used with "some frequency." His research examining the first 330 DNA exonerations in the United States found that 22\u160\'00\'A0percent of the wrongful-conviction cases examined had informant testimony, including jailhouse informants and other types of incentivized witnesses. Because of the problems inherent with jailhouse informants, some think using them should be banned, while others advocate reforms, being pioneered in a few states, for stringent judicial review or videotaping of interrogations.\par \par \uc2 And it's not just the accused who can be hurt when something goes wrong with a jailhouse informant. Just ask Levy's parents, who are still waiting \u8212\'20\'14 after 15 years \u8212\'20\'14 for justice in their daughter's death.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020160805ec85007vh\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 JACKSONVILLE, Fla. \u8212\'20\'14 While the media again and again recounts \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 's latest self-brewed controversy, his supporters say they don't care.\par \par \uc2 Telling the Russians to hack a former secretary of state's emails? A joke, many of them say.\par \par \uc2 Insulting the family of fallen war hero? He was baited into it, they say.\par \par \uc2 Refusing to endorse the reelection of Republican stalwarts such as \uc2 Sen. John McCain\uc2  (Ariz.) and House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (Wis.)? They say Trump\u160\'00\'A0doesn't need the Republican leadership.\par \par \uc2 Many of Trump's supporters say they don't even care that he seemed to kick\u160\'00\'A0a crying baby out of a rally in Virginia earlier this week.\par \par \uc2 "He was joking," said Spencer Marble, 19, during Trump's latest campaign rally here Wednesday\u160\'00\'A0night.\par \par \uc2 To Marble and countless\u160\'00\'A0other Trump supporters, that was\u160\'00\'A0just another Trump joke misinterpreted and exaggerated into controversy by a hostile media. At two rallies Wednesday in Florida \u8212\'20\'14 first at the\u160\'00\'A0Ocean Center in Daytona Beach and later at an arena in Jacksonville\u160\'00\'A0\u8212\'20\'14 several supporters said they're willing to overlook these jokes and ineloquent comments because Trump has taken on\u160\'00\'A0the heroic task of rescuing the United States and returning it to glory.\par \par \uc2 "If that's all they got, they got nothing," said Jeff Jarrell, 59, a general contractor who attended the event in Daytona Beach.\par \par \uc2 "The number one thing that I love about him the most is that he stood up to the Old Establishment of both the Democratic and Republican parties," Jarrell said. "The Old Establishment is not supporting him, and he won't need them."\par \par \uc2 Jarrell said he\u160\'00\'A0thinks Trump\u160\'00\'A0supports\u160\'00\'A0ordinary working Americans over the elite and that he will rebuild the middle class by rebuilding the manufacturing base and wrestling power from big corporations, the moneyed elite and the politicians who do their bidding.\par \par \uc2 "It's about the people," Jarrell observed. "And the people have spoken."\par \par \uc2 Also at the Daytona Beach rally was Don Gruber, an 80-year-old who admits Trump\u160\'00\'A0is\u160\'00\'A0too easily provoked and too easily drawn into controversies. Gruber, a Marine veteran of the Korean and Vietnam wars, sat on a motorized wheelchair in front of\u160\'00\'A0his wife, Terry. In Vietnam, Gruber said he lost half of his left arm and that an explosion mangled one of his legs \u8212\'20\'14 so he understands the sacrifice of Khizr and Ghazala Khan, the Muslim American parents whose son, Army Capt. Humayun Khan, was killed in a car-bomb attack in Iraq in 2004. They\u160\'00\'A0challenged Trump's views\u160\'00\'A0at the Democratic National Convention last month, prompting criticism from him. Gruber\u160\'00\'A0said\u160\'00\'A0Trump is too easily drawn off his really important message of saving the United States.\par \par \uc2 "It was a set up," said Gruber of the Kahn controversy. "He fell into it."\par \par \uc2 Gruber's advice for Trump: "Stay on topic. Stay on topic," he said.\par \par \uc2 But that tendency doesn't dissuade Gruber from his belief that Trump will be a great president. He just thinks Trump\u160\'00\'A0needs more grooming and a bunch of really experienced people advising him.\par \par \uc2 Later on Wednesday in Jacksonville,\u160\'00\'A0about 100 protesters lined the street leading to the Jacksonville Veterans Memorial Arena, where at least 10,000 people attended Trump's rally. One protester with a megaphone led a group in a chant: "\uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 , You're an a--. Here comes the working class." When protesters and supporters of Trump started\u160\'00\'A0to clash and\u160\'00\'A0the arguments grew heated, a group of Jacksonville sheriff deputies\u160\'00\'A0told the crowd to leave the area and walked in a line, shoulder to shoulder, to push the protesters down a sidewalk and away from the arena.\par \par \uc2 Inside the Jacksonville rally, the working class was on the mind of electrician Larry Hodges, 50. He sees similarities between Trump and Sen. Bernie Sanders's (I-Vt.) critique of the U.S. economic system, and he agrees with Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) that banking regulations need to be strengthened. He said he believes\u160\'00\'A0Trump's promises to rebuild the U.S. manufacturing base will reestablish the middle class, and he says that banning the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  labor force will increase jobs. Both those efforts, he said, will get more money flowing through the economy.\par \par \uc2 During the rally, Trump said that earlier he met with six Gold Star families whose loved ones were killed in the Iraq War. He said\u160\'00\'A0one man gave him a campaign donation, telling the nominee\u160\'00\'A0that it was more money than he could afford.\par \par \uc2 "I just thought it was amazing," Trump said during the rally. "The love in that room for this country is amazing."\par \par \uc2 Steve Roberts, who was also at the Jacksonville rally, said that "American culture and the American a way of life has gone off track" and that the\u160\'00\'A0last time it was on track was in\u160\'00\'A0the days after the\u160\'00\'A09/11 attacks.\par \par \uc2 "Americans came together after 9/11,"\u160\'00\'A0Roberts\u160\'00\'A0said. "I remember that time when we were Americans together, and we need a president that will pull us together."\par \par \uc2 Back then, Roberts saw the displays of patriotism, such as\u160\'00\'A0flags waving from car antennae and television news anchors sporting flag pins. But he complained the togetherness only lasted five or six years. As the crowd in the arena in Jacksonville bellowed, "USA! USA! USA!" and "Trump! Trump! Trump!" Roberts says he felt that fervor again.\par \par \uc2 Correction: An earlier version of this report included an incorrect reference to the Jacksonville Veterans Memorial Arena.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020160804ec84005pm\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

Alexander \par \uc2 346 \uc2 words\par \uc2 1 August 2016\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Ingmar Guandique, the man previously charged with the 2001 slaying of federal intern Chandra Levy, was released from D.C. jail Saturday and placed in the custody of immigration officials after prosecutors dismissed charges against him in the 15-year-old case.\par \par \uc2 A spokeswoman for the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said Monday that Guandique was in the agency's custody and that he is awaiting a hearing in immigration court.\par \par \uc2 Guandique was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from El Salvador at the time he was charged in Levy's death.\par \par \uc2 In 2002, Levy's skeletal remains were found in Rock Creek Park in Washington. Guandique was found to be a suspect in Levy's killing due to the fact that he had admitted attacking two women in the same park around the time of Levy's disappearance.\par \par \uc2 "Due to his previous criminal convictions, he is considered a threat to public safety, and ICE intends to maintain him in custody," agency spokeswoman Carissa Cutrell said in a statement.\par \par \uc2 Levy was a 24-year-old intern with the \uc2 Federal Bureau of Prisons\uc2  when she disappeared May 1, 2001.\par \par \uc2 The intern's disappearance and killing captured national attention when it was revealed that she had had an affair with then-Rep. Gary A. Condit (D-Calif.), who was married and 30 years her senior. Police initially focused on Condit as a suspect but later cleared him.\par \par \uc2 In 2010, during a trial, Guandique was found guilty of killing Levy after a star witness in the trial, Guandique's cellmate, Armando Morales, told authorities that Guandique admitted to him that he had killed Levy.\par \par \uc2 But last year, Guandique was granted a new trial after attorneys discovered that Morales was not truthful in his testimony.\par \par \uc2 Last week, prosecutors dropped their new case against Guandique after they discovered additional evidence that Morales may have told additional lies during his testimony, which would have further damaged his credibility if the case had gone to trial.\par \par \uc2 keith.alexander@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020160801ec81007pt\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 right-turn\par {\*\bkmkstart toc43}{\*\bkmkend toc43}\b \uc2 How not to improve GDP \b0\par\par\uc2 By Jennifer Rubin \par \uc2 1,074 \uc2 words\par \uc2 1 August 2016\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 We have the worst economic recovery since Harry Truman was president. The Wall Street Journal reported:\par \par \uc2 Gross domestic product, the broadest measure of goods and services produced across the U.S., grew at a seasonally and inflation adjusted annual rate of just 1.2% in the second quarter, the Commerce Department said Friday, well below the pace economists expected.\par \par \uc2 The responses from the two major-party candidates are distressingly inadequate, counterproductive or politically impossible. \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  wants tax cuts that would give a windfall to the rich and increase the debt by at least $10 trillion over 10 years. He wants less regulation (not a bad idea in principle), wants to shrink the labor force and consumer markets by 11 million to 12 million people by rounding up and expelling illegal immigrants (an awful idea in principle and in the particulars) and wants to engage in a trade war with China (an awful idea and a surefire way to help send us skidding into a recession). The good news is that little to none of this will happen. "I agree, the actual proposals that Trump is touting would not be good for the US economy. The closing down of trade with China is an absurdity for example. But I say that this doesn't matter," writes Tim Worstall in Forbes. "Simply because no one, not even Trump, thinks he'd ever get these ideas implemented, America just doesn't work that way. This is all showground stuff to gain votes, no more and no less than that." Unfortunately, that would leave us with no proposals reasonably designed to stoke economic growth.\par \par \uc2 The good news is that \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  might get more things done. The bad news is that a lot of what she is proposing -- tax hikes, hiking the minimum wage (likely to reduce the number of entry-level jobs), "free" college, etc. -- \u160\'00\'A0is either not going to do much for job growth, isn't paid for or both. According to \uc2 Yahoo\uc2 , \uc2 Moody's\uc2  notes:\par \par \uc2 [Clinton's] proposals would "do little to directly promote increased private sector investment," \uc2 Moody's\uc2  says, relying instead on government spending as the primary stimulus. And by promoting so many small ideas instead of a few overarching ones\u8212\'20\'14such as corporate tax reform or a new value-added tax \u8212\'20\'14 Clinton is essentially promising even more government bureaucracy to implement and enforce yet more complexity in the sprawling federal regulatory regime.\par \par \uc2 Well, her infrastructure plan would at least be marginally useful, as is her idea to "slash unnecessary regulations, making it easier to get start-up capital from community banks and credit unions." Also intriguing is her idea "to expand incentives like the new market's tax credit, empowerment zones and other ideas that bring business, government and communities together to create good jobs in poor or remote areas." By the same token,\u160\'00\'A0tightening labor rules as a bone to Big Labor, as she proposed, and requiring companies to offer employee profit-sharing -- are not helpful in the least if we want to jump-start economic growth. "Renegotiating trade deals" likely won't happen since, well, we made agreements to abide by certain rules and in any event may turn out to be as ill-advised as Trump's trade war.\par \par \uc2 There are some ideas that would actually help, although politicians don't seem to have the nerve to test them.\par \par \uc2 First, we know immigration\u160\'00\'A0increases growth. The \uc2 Congressional Budget Office\uc2  found that the much maligned Gang of 8 bill would have boosted GDP by\u160\'00\'A03.3 percent in 2023 and by 5.4 percent in 2033. Take a look at Israel, which has undergone an enviable economic boom. A significant part of that was attributable to immigration of Russian Jews and continues to be fueled by newcomers. As noted in the Times of Israel, "In the Start-Up Nation, many of the entrepreneurs are new immigrants. Whether they are entrepreneurs by choice or by lack of alternatives on the job market, their challenge is doubled. They start a new life in a new country with a different culture, language, and environment. And while they are busy building their new life and identity, they are also creating new companies." Innovations like The Hive startup accelerator cater specifically to new immigrants. Forget about low-skill immigration for now or the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  problem. Do something about legal immigration to maximize the economic benefits we can get from newcomers.\par \par \uc2 Second, you guessed it -- trade is good for economic growth. The also-maligned Trans-Pacific Partnership would "[level] the\u160\'00\'A0playing field for American workers and American businesses by eliminating over 18,000 taxes that various countries impose on Made-in-America exports, providing unprecedented access to vital new markets in the Asia-Pacific region for U.S. workers, businesses, farmers, and ranchers." It especially helps in economic sectors in which the United States thrives. ("TPP lifts complex restrictions and bans on access for U.S. businesses\u8212\'20\'14including many small businesses\u8212\'20\'14that export American services like retail, communications, logistics, entertainment, software and more. This improved access will unlock new economic opportunities for the U.S. services industry, which currently employs about 4 out of every 5 American workers.") Well, you can see why the two political candidates are opposed to that, huh? (Opposition to TPP may be the single stupidest bipartisan position in decades.)\par \par \uc2 Third, there is a lot to be said for investment in human capital (worker training, apprentice programs, charter schools) and corporate tax reform (broaden the base, lower rates, reform economic distortion, full expensing of capital investments) provided we don't drown in a pool of red ink. Expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit can also subsidize work, increasing the labor participation rate. If we want to spend more in the discretionary area of the budget, that means we need bipartisan cooperation on reducing long-term debt -- reforming entitlements for future retirees. Alas, neither of the candidates wants to do that. Trump insists there is no need to reform entitlements; Clinton wants to expand Social Security.\par \par \uc2 In other words, if we do pretty much the opposite of what the two candidates want to do, we'll be fine. The tragic part is that we have the capacity to be growing at much higher levels. Our politicians, however, are playing dumb -- or really don't understand how to promote economic growth.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020160801ec81004pi\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

Alexander                Lynh Bui  \par \uc2 1,216 \uc2 words\par \uc2 31 July 2016\par \uc2 The Washington Post\par \uc2 WP\par \uc2 FINAL\par A01\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved  \par \par \uc2 This week, prosecutors and defense attorneys were set to travel to a California meeting, preparing for the retrial of the man charged with killing Washington intern Chandra Levy in 2001. But that travel plan changed abruptly and the murder case crumbled.\par \par \uc2 Lawyers on both sides had learned about recent secretly recorded conversations with the man who was to have been the key witness against Ingmar Guandique, Levy's alleged killer. On Thursday, prosecutors dropped all charges against Guandique, telling defense attorneys that new information had left them unable to prove their case.\par \par \uc2 New details about how the case unraveled emerged Friday from defense attorneys, who said the case was closed shortly after they and prosecutors received recordings from a Maryland woman of conversations she had with star witness and jailhouse informant Armando Morales.\par \par \uc2 The woman told both sides that Morales said in the recordings that he lied when he testified that Guandique had told him about killing Levy, according to the defense attorneys from the District's Public Defender's Service.\par \par \uc2 The defense team never played the recordings because they believed that they had been made illegally under Maryland law, said Laura Hankins, general counsel for the Public Defender's Service.\par \par \uc2 But after receiving the tapes, prosecutors dropped the charges citing "new information the government received within the past week."\par \par \uc2 Signs that the prosecution's case was beginning to unravel emerged July 21 during a routine hearing in D.C. Superior Court.\par \par \uc2 At that hearing - one of dozens leading up to the retrial - one of the prosecutors told the judge about a witness who contacted them and told them that she had "information" about Morales.\par \par \uc2 By the weekend, the woman, Babs Proller, had told prosecutors and defense attorneys about her secret recordings of Morales. Proller, a part-time actress, said she struck up an acquaintance with Morales, who had recently been released from prison, in early July when she was living in a Maryland hotel.\par \par \uc2 "Ms. Proller indicated to us that Mr. Morales had told her that he had lied when he testified against Mr. Guandique," said one of Guandique's attorneys, Katerina Semyonova.\par \par \uc2 Proller made the same assertion in interviews with The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors declined to discuss the recordings or specifics about why they dropped the charges because they are continuing to investigate the Levy case.\par \par \uc2 Morales testified at Guandique's trial in 2010 that the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from El Salvador admitted when they were cellmates that he had killed Levy. Morales's testimony was critical and resulted in Guandique's conviction and a 60-year prison sentence.\par \par \uc2 Levy was a 24-year-old intern with the \uc2 Federal Bureau of Prisons\uc2  when she disappeared on May 1, 2001. Her remains were found in 2002 in Rock Creek Park.\par \par \uc2 The intern's disappearance and killing captured national attention when it was revealed that she had an affair with then-Rep. Gary A. Condit (D-Calif.), who was married and 30 years her senior. Police initially focused on Condit as a suspect but later cleared him.\par \par \uc2 Years later, authorities charged Guandique in the case, alleging that he had killed Levy while she was jogging in Rock Creek Park. He had pleaded guilty to attacking two other women in the park in a period close to Levy's disappearance, and prosecutors argued that he was a predator who also attacked Levy.\par \par \uc2 But Guandique's conviction was overturned last year because of a lie by Morales.\par \par \uc2 After the conviction, prosecutors learned that Morales had falsely said during his testimony that he had never testified as an informant before his cooperation with prosecutors in the Levy case.\par \par \uc2 Trying to prove that Guandique was the killer was difficult for prosecutors from the start. There was no forensic evidence and no eyewitness. The heart of the prosecution's case rested with Morales, who said he shared a cell at a Kentucky prison with Guandique in 2006 and became the first to directly link Guandique to Levy's death.\par \par \uc2 Proller, in an interview with The Post, said that she and Morales met July 6. During their conversations, Proller said, Morales had threatened to hurt her ex-husband, which prompted her to begin recording their discussions.\par \par \uc2 Proller, who according to an IMDB page has appeared on the \uc2 Netflix\uc2  TV series "House of Cards," said that she thought the recordings could protect her and that she didn't want to be implicated in any crimes against her ex-husband.\par \par \uc2 Over the course of three days, "he told me his life story," Proller said. "He said he is a key witness in a major murder case."\par \par \uc2 According to Proller, Morales told her that he had lied about Guandique's confession to improve his prison conditions and that he struck a deal with prosecutors in exchange for his testimony.\par \par \uc2 Proller said after she told Levy's mother, Susan Levy, about the recorded conversations she had made. Susan Levy then contacted the authorities, Proller said and Susan Levy confirmed in an interview Friday.\par \par \uc2 Susan Levy said she gave Proller a contact number for prosecutors after being told the recordings contained Morales lying. Levy said she declined to listen to the recordings because she did not want to hear the details, she told The Post. "I can't believe we are going through this all over again," she said.\par \par \uc2 Proller later turned over the recordings to prosecutors.\par \par \uc2 Robert Levy, Chandra Levy's father, said in an interview Friday that he learned Thursday from prosecutors about their intent to drop the murder case against Guandique because of the Morales sessions with Proller.\par \par \uc2 He said the news of the dismissal was "hard" for his family. But he said he doesn't believe Morales told Proller that he lied. And instead, he now blames Proller for shattering the prosecution's case.\par \par \uc2 "Who is this woman? What is her motivation for doing this," Levy asked in a telephone interview from his home in Modesto, Calif. "Maybe she tricked him into saying those things."\par \par \uc2 He says he still believes Guandique killed his daughter, despite prosecutors' decision to dismiss the charges. "The case is already solved. But this person [Proller] helped get" him out, he said. "You have to wonder why a person would do that."\par \par \uc2 Proller said in a Thursday interview that no one paid her to make the recordings, that running into Morales was a "coincidence," and that she contacted the Levy family because she wanted to help.\par \par \uc2 "It is by simple coincidence that Ms. Proller came to have any involvement with this tragic situation," according to a statement Friday from Proller's attorney. "Ms. Proller became aware of information relevant to the case and she conveyed that information to the all of the appropriate people - the prosecutors, and defense attorneys and Ms. Levy."\par \par \uc2 Proller stepped forward, the statement said, because she "believed then, and believes now, that it was the right thing to do."\par \par \uc2 Guandique, 34, has been jailed awaiting retrial. After his release, he will be placed in the custody of \uc2 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2 , where he faces deportation.\par \par \uc2 keith.alexander@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 lynh.bui@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 Robert O'Harrow and Scott Higham contributed to this report. \par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com  \par \par \uc2 WP20160731levy0730\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020160731ec7v00034\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

Alexander                Lynh Bui  \par \uc2 1,216 \uc2 words\par \uc2 30 July 2016\par \uc2 The Washington Post\par \uc2 WP\par \uc2 FINAL\par A01\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved  \par \par \uc2 This week, prosecutors and defense attorneys were set to travel to a California meeting, preparing for the retrial of the man charged with killing Washington intern Chandra Levy in 2001. But that travel plan changed abruptly and the murder case crumbled.\par \par \uc2 Lawyers on both sides had learned about recent secretly recorded conversations with the man who was to have been the key witness against Ingmar Guandique, Levy's alleged killer. On Thursday, prosecutors dropped all charges against Guandique, telling defense attorneys that new information had left them unable to prove their case.\par \par \uc2 New details about how the case unraveled emerged Friday from defense attorneys, who said the case was closed shortly after they and prosecutors received recordings from a Maryland woman of conversations she had with star witness and jailhouse informant Armando Morales.\par \par \uc2 The woman told both sides that Morales said in the recordings that he lied when he testified that Guandique had told him about killing Levy, according to the defense attorneys from the District's Public Defender's Service.\par \par \uc2 The defense team never played the recordings because they believed that they had been made illegally under Maryland law, said Laura Hankins, general counsel for the Public Defender's Service.\par \par \uc2 But after receiving the tapes, prosecutors dropped the charges, citing "new information the government received within the past week."\par \par \uc2 Signs that the prosecution's case was beginning to unravel emerged July 21 during a routine hearing in D.C. Superior Court.\par \par \uc2 At that hearing - one of dozens leading up to the retrial - one of the prosecutors told the judge about a witness who contacted them and told them that she had "information" about Morales.\par \par \uc2 By the weekend, the woman, Babs Proller, had told prosecutors and defense attorneys about her secret recordings of Morales. Proller, a part-time actress, said she struck up an acquaintance with Morales, who had recently been released from prison, in early July when she was living in a Maryland hotel.\par \par \uc2 "Ms. Proller indicated to us that Mr. Morales had told her that he had lied when he testified against Mr. Guandique," said one of Guandique's attorneys, Katerina Semyonova.\par \par \uc2 Proller made the same assertion in interviews with The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors declined to discuss the recordings or specifics about why they dropped the charges because they are continuing to investigate the Levy case.\par \par \uc2 Morales testified at Guandique's trial in 2010 that the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from El Salvador admitted when they were cellmates that he had killed Levy. Morales's testimony was critical and resulted in Guandique's conviction and a 60-year prison sentence.\par \par \uc2 Levy was a 24-year-old intern with the \uc2 Federal Bureau of Prisons\uc2  when she disappeared on May 1, 2001. Her remains were found in 2002 in Rock Creek Park.\par \par \uc2 The intern's disappearance and killing captured national attention when it was revealed that she had an affair with then-Rep. Gary A. Condit (D-Calif.), who was married and 30 years her senior. Police initially focused on Condit as a suspect but later cleared him.\par \par \uc2 Years later, authorities charged Guandique in the case, alleging that he had killed Levy while she was jogging in Rock Creek Park. He had pleaded guilty to attacking two other women in the park in a period close to Levy's disappearance, and prosecutors argued that he was a predator who also attacked Levy.\par \par \uc2 But Guandique's conviction was overturned last year because of a lie by Morales.\par \par \uc2 After the conviction, prosecutors learned that Morales had falsely said during his testimony that he had never testified as an informant before his cooperation with prosecutors in the Levy case.\par \par \uc2 Trying to prove that Guandique was the killer was difficult for prosecutors from the start. There was no forensic evidence and no eyewitness. The heart of the prosecution's case rested with Morales, who said he shared a cell at a Kentucky prison with Guandique in 2006 and became the first to directly link Guandique to Levy's death.\par \par \uc2 Proller, in an interview with The Post, said that she and Morales met July 6. During their conversations, Proller said, Morales had threatened to hurt her ex-husband, which prompted her to begin recording their discussions.\par \par \uc2 Proller, who according to an IMDB page has appeared on the \uc2 Netflix\uc2  TV series "House of Cards," said that she thought the recordings could protect her and that she didn't want to be implicated in any crimes against her ex-husband.\par \par \uc2 Over the course of three days, "he told me his life story," Proller said. "He said he is a key witness in a major murder case."\par \par \uc2 According to Proller, Morales told her that he had lied about Guandique's confession to improve his prison conditions and that he struck a deal with prosecutors in exchange for his testimony.\par \par \uc2 Proller said after she told Levy's mother, Susan Levy, about the recorded conversations she had made. Susan Levy then contacted the authorities, Proller said and Susan Levy confirmed in an interview Friday.\par \par \uc2 Susan Levy said she gave Proller a contact number for prosecutors after being told the recordings contained Morales lying. Levy said she declined to listen to the recordings because she did not want to hear the details, she told The Post. "I can't believe we are going through this all over again," she said.\par \par \uc2 Proller later turned over the recordings to prosecutors.\par \par \uc2 Robert Levy, Chandra Levy's father, said in an interview Friday that he learned Thursday from prosecutors about their intent to drop the murder case against Guandique because of the Morales sessions with Proller.\par \par \uc2 He said the news of the dismissal was "hard" for his family. But he said he doesn't believe Morales told Proller that he lied. And instead, he now blames Proller for shattering the prosecution's case.\par \par \uc2 "Who is this woman? What is her motivation for doing this," Levy asked in a telephone interview from his home in Modesto, Calif. "Maybe she tricked him into saying those things."\par \par \uc2 He says he still believes Guandique killed his daughter, despite the prosecutors' decision to dismiss the charges. "The case is already solved. But this person [Proller] helped get" him out, he said. "You have to wonder why a person would do that."\par \par \uc2 Proller said in a Thursday interview that no one paid her to make the recordings, that running into Morales was a "coincidence," and that she contacted the Levy family because she wanted to help.\par \par \uc2 "It is by simple coincidence that Ms. Proller came to have any involvement with this tragic situation," according to a statement Friday from Proller's attorney. "Ms. Proller became aware of information relevant to the case and she conveyed that information to all of the appropriate people - the prosecutors, and defense attorneys and Ms. Levy."\par \par \uc2 Proller stepped forward, the statement said, because she "believed then, and believes now, that it was the right thing to do."\par \par \uc2 Guandique, 34, has been jailed awaiting retrial. After his release, he will be placed in the custody of \uc2 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2 , where he faces deportation.\par \par \uc2 keith.alexander@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 lynh.bui@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 Robert O'Harrow and Scott Higham contributed to this report. \par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com \par \par \uc2 WP20160730levy0730\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020160730ec7u00016\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

Alexander;Lynh Bui  \par \uc2 1,216 \uc2 words\par \uc2 30 July 2016\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved.  \par \par \uc2 This week, prosecutors and defense attorneys were set to travel to a California meeting, preparing for the retrial of the man charged with killing Washington intern Chandra Levy in 2001. But that travel plan changed abruptly and the murder case crumbled.\par \par \uc2 Lawyers on both sides had learned about recent secretly recorded conversations with the man who was to have been the key witness against Ingmar Guandique, Levy's alleged killer. On Thursday, prosecutors dropped all charges against Guandique, telling defense attorneys that new information had left them unable to prove their case.\par \par \uc2 New details about how the case unraveled emerged Friday from defense attorneys, who said the case was closed shortly after prosecutors received recordings from a Maryland woman of conversations she had with star witness and jailhouse informant Armando Morales.\par \par \uc2 The woman told both sides that Morales said in the recordings that he lied when he testified that Guandique had told him about killing Levy, according to the defense attorneys from the District's Public Defender's Service.\par \par \uc2 The defense team never played the recordings because they believed that they had been made illegally under Maryland law, said Laura Hankins, general counsel for the Public Defender's Service.\par \par \uc2 But after receiving the tapes, prosecutors dropped the charges, citing "new information the government received within the past week."\par \par \uc2 Signs that the prosecution's case was beginning to unravel emerged July\u160\'00\'A021 during a routine hearing in D.C. Superior Court.\par \par \uc2 At that hearing \u8212\'20\'14 one of dozens leading up to the retrial \u8212\'20\'14 one of the prosecutors told the judge about a witness who contacted them and told them that she had "information" about Morales.\par \par \uc2 By the weekend, the woman, Babs Proller, had told prosecutors and defense attorneys about her secret recordings of Morales. Proller,\u8194\'20\'02a part-time actress, said she struck up an acquaintance with Morales, who had recently been released from prison, in early July when she was living in a Maryland hotel.\par \par \uc2 "Ms. Proller indicated to us that Mr. Morales had told her that he had lied when he testified against Mr. Guandique," said one of Guandique's attorneys, Katerina Semyonova.\par \par \uc2 Proller made the same assertion in interviews with The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors declined to discuss the recordings or specifics about why they dropped the charges because they are continuing to investigate the Levy case.\par \par \uc2 Morales testified at Guandique's trial in 2010 that the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from El Salvador admitted when they were cellmates that he had killed Levy. Morales's testimony was critical and resulted in Guandique's conviction and a 60-year prison sentence.\par \par \uc2 Levy was a 24-year-old intern with the \uc2 Federal Bureau of Prisons\uc2  when she disappeared on May 1, 2001. Her remains were found in 2002 in Rock Creek Park.\par \par \uc2 The intern's disappearance and killing captured national attention when it was revealed that she had an affair with then-Rep. Gary A. Condit (D-Calif.), who was married and 30 years her senior. Police initially focused on Condit as a suspect but later cleared him.\par \par \uc2 Years later, authorities charged Guandique in the case, alleging that he had killed Levy while she was jogging in Rock Creek Park. He had pleaded guilty to attacking two other women in the park in a period close to Levy's disappearance, and prosecutors argued that he was a predator who also attacked Levy.\par \par \uc2 But Guandique's conviction was overturned last year because of a lie by Morales.\par \par \uc2 After the conviction, prosecutors learned that Morales had falsely said during his testimony that he had never testified as an informant before his cooperation with prosecutors in the Levy case.\par \par \uc2 Trying to prove that Guandique was the killer was difficult for prosecutors from the start. There was no forensic evidence and no eyewitness. The heart of the prosecution's case rested with Morales, who said he shared a cell at a Kentucky prison with Guandique in 2006 and became the first to directly link Guandique to Levy's death.\par \par \uc2 Proller, in an interview with The Post, said that she and Morales met July 6. During their conversations, Proller said, Morales had threatened to hurt her ex-husband, which prompted her to begin recording their discussions.\par \par \uc2 Proller, who according to an IMDB page has appeared on the \uc2 Netflix\uc2  TV series "House of Cards," said that she thought the recordings could protect her and that she didn't want to be implicated in any crimes against her ex-husband.\par \par \uc2 Over the course of three days, "he told me his life story," Proller said. "He said he is a key witness in a major murder case."\par \par \uc2 According to Proller, Morales told her that he had lied about Guandique's confession to improve his prison conditions and that he struck a deal with prosecutors in exchange for his testimony.\par \par \uc2 Proller said after she told Levy's mother, Susan Levy, about the recorded conversations she had made. Susan Levy then contacted the authorities, Proller said and Susan Levy confirmed in an interview Friday.\par \par \uc2 Susan Levy said she gave Proller a contact number for prosecutors after being told the recordings contained Morales lying. Levy said she declined to listen to the recordings because she did not want to hear the details, she told The Post. "I can't believe we are going through this all over again," she said.\par \par \uc2 Proller later turned over the recordings to prosecutors.\par \par \uc2 Robert Levy, Chandra Levy's father, said in an interview Friday that he learned Thursday from prosecutors about their intent to drop the murder case against Guandique because of the Morales sessions with Proller.\par \par \uc2 He said the news of the dismissal was "hard" for his family. But he said he doesn't believe Morales told Proller that he lied. And instead, he now blames Proller for shattering the prosecution's case.\par \par \uc2 "Who is this woman? What is her motivation for doing this," Levy asked in a telephone interview from his home in Modesto, Calif. "Maybe she tricked him into saying those things."\par \par \uc2 He says he still believes Guandique killed his daughter, despite the prosecutors' decision to dismiss the charges. "The case is already solved. But this person [Proller] helped get" him out, he said. "You have to wonder why a person would do that."\par \par \uc2 Proller said in a Thursday interview that no one paid her to make the recordings, that running into Morales was a "coincidence," and that she contacted the Levy family because she wanted to help.\par \par \uc2 "It is by simple coincidence that Ms. Proller came to have any involvement with this tragic situation," according to a statement Friday from Proller's attorney. "Ms. Proller became aware of information relevant to the case and she conveyed that information to all of the appropriate people \u8212\'20\'14 the prosecutors, and defense attorneys and Ms. Levy."\par \par \uc2 Proller stepped forward, the statement said, because she "believed then, and believes now, that it was the right thing to do."\par \par \uc2 Guandique, 34, has been jailed awaiting retrial. After his release, he will be placed in the custody of \uc2 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2 , where he faces deportation.\par \par \uc2 keith.alexander@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 lynh.bui@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 Robert O'Harrow and Scott Higham contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020160730ec7u000b6\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved  \par \par \uc2 Babs Proller met the man when she was living in a Maryland hotel. He had helped the local actress carry her dog, Buddy, to her fourth-floor room, and over the course of several days in early July, the two neighbors became friendly.\par \par \uc2 She soon learned that her new acquaintance, Armando Morales, was a convicted felon and former gang member, recently released after decades in prison. He was also the star witness in one of the Washington area's most sensational murder trials.\par \par \uc2 Proller eventually became suspicious of Morales and began recording hours of their conversations. Eventually, she contends, Morales revealed a secret that she caught on tape, telling her that he had lied when he testified in 2010 that a onetime cellmate had confessed to killing Chandra Levy.\par \par \uc2 Those clandestine recordings led to a stunning announcement by District prosecutors on Thursday that they would drop all charges against Ingmar Guandique, who was facing a retrial in the 2001 slaying of the federal intern, according to Proller and individuals familiar with the investigation.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2  could not independently verify the content of the recordings or the accuracy of Proller's description. The U.S. attorney's office would not comment on Proller's account and said only that "new information" uncovered this week had led prosecutors to conclude that they could not prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt.\par \par \uc2 Two officials with knowledge of the investigation declined to discuss details of the recordings but said that the audio led prosecutors to question Morales's credibility.\par \par \uc2 The dropped charges - coming just three months before the retrial was set to begin in the 15-year-old case - bolsters arguments made by Guandique and his attorneys, who have steadfastly said he was being wrongly held.\par \par \uc2 They had insisted that Morales was making up his account to gain favor with authorities. It also leaves one of the nation's most infamous murder mysteries unresolved.\par \par \uc2 In a statement, the D.C. Public Defender Service noted that Guandique "has maintained since the beginning, when he passed an \uc2 FBI\uc2  administered lie detector test, that he did not kill Ms. Levy."\par \par \uc2 "It is now clear that the jailhouse informant, who was central to the government's case, was a perjurer who too easily manipulated the prosecutors," the attorneys said in the statement.\par \par \uc2 Levy was a 24-year-old intern with the \uc2 Federal Bureau of Prisons\uc2  when she disappeared on May 1, 2001. Her remains were found in 2002 in Rock Creek Park.\par \par \uc2 The intern's disappearance and killing captured national attention when it was revealed that she had an affair with then-Rep. Gary A. Condit (D-Calif.), who was married and 30 years her senior. Police initially focused on Condit as a suspect but later cleared him.\par \par \uc2 Years later, authorities charged Guandique in the case, alleging that he had killed Levy while she was jogging in Rock Creek Park. He had pleaded guilty to attacking two other women in the park about the same time Levy was killed, and prosecutors argued that he was a predator who also attacked Levy.\par \par \uc2 Proving their theory was difficult from the start. There was no forensic evidence and no eyewitness. The heart of the prosecution's case rested with Morales, who said he shared a cell at a Kentucky prison with Guandique in 2006.\par \par \uc2 Morales, a five-time convicted felon, captivated D.C. Superior Court with his testimony. He took the stand on the eighth day of the 2010 trial and was the first to directly link Guandique to Levy's death.\par \par \uc2 According to Morales, Guandique had said: "You don't understand. . . . Homeboy, I killed the [expletive], but I didn't rape her."\par \par \uc2 Morales told the jury that Guandique had said he saw Levy carrying a waist pouch and thought there would be cash inside. He recounted how he grabbed her from behind, Morales said, and dragged her off the trail.\par \par \uc2 She tried to fight, according to Morales's account of his cellmate's purported confession, but by the time Guandique got her into the bushes, she had stopped struggling. Morales testified that Guandique told him that he thought Levy was unconscious, not dead.\par \par \uc2 Guandique claimed that he took Levy's pouch and fled, Morales said.\par \par \uc2 "He said he never meant to kill her," Morales testified.\par \par \uc2 Morales said in court that Guandique confided in him because he feared he was about to be transferred to a new prison where inmates might view him as a rapist for the attacks on the two other women and target him in a way that they wouldn't target a killer.\par \par \uc2 Morales spoke slowly about the man he called "Chucky," a reference to the murderous doll in the 1988 horror movie "Child's Play." He pointed to Guandique in the courtroom and said Guandique had the nickname tattooed across his back. A photo of the tattoo was shown to the jury of 12 women and four men. Morales said he remembered the tattoo in part because "Chucky" was misspelled: C-h-a-c-k-y.\par \par \uc2 The men bonded over their gang affiliations. Morales, who pleaded guilty in 1997 to dealing cocaine and methamphetamine while armed, was serving a 21-year sentence. He was a founding member of the Fresno Bulldogs, a gang based in California and aligned with Guandique's gang, Mara Salvatrucha, or MS-13, prosecutors said at the time of trial.\par \par \uc2 At the close of the trial, Guandique was convicted and sentenced to 60 years in prison.\par \par \uc2 Over the following years, Guandique's attorneys challenged the conviction. They argued that it "was based on a lie" spun by Morales and said the government had failed to reveal that their witness had previously cooperated with law enforcement as a prison informant.\par \par \uc2 Last year, the conviction was overturned after prosecutors dropped their opposition to defense requests to have a new jury hear the case. The trial was set to begin in the fall.\par \par \uc2 In documents filed with the court, Guandique's defense attorneys said they were considering a strategy for trial in which they would argue that Condit or someone else had a motive to kill Levy.\par \par \uc2 In a statement released Thursday, Condit's attorney said the former congressman was "extremely disappointed" that the case had been dropped.\par \par \uc2 "The failure of authorities to bring formal closure to this tragedy after 15 years is very disappointing but in no way alters the fact that Mr. Condit was long ago completely exonerated by authorities in connection with Ms. Levy's death," the statement read.\par \par \uc2 Guandique, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from El Salvador, has been jailed awaiting retrial. After his release, he will be placed in the custody of \uc2 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2 , where he faces removal proceedings, officials said.\par \par \uc2 Proller said that she and Morales met July 6.\par \par \uc2 During their conversations, Proller said, Morales had threatened to hurt her ex-husband, which prompted her to begin recording their discussions. Proller said she thought the recordings could protect her and she didn't want to be implicated in any crimes against her ex-husband.\par \par \uc2 Proller sent The Post cellphone images of Morales's prison identification and photos of Morales.\par \par \uc2 Over the course of three days, "he told me his life story," Proller said. "He said he is a key witness in a major murder case."\par \par \uc2 According to Proller, he lied about Guandique's confession to improve his prison conditions and eventually struck a deal with prosecutors in exchange for his testimony.\par \par \uc2 Proller said she told Levy's mother, Susan Levy, about the recorded conversations with Morales. Susan Levy then contacted the authorities, Proller said. Proller said she turned over the recordings to prosecutors, with whom she has been in contact since Friday.\par \par \uc2 Calls to Susan Levy were not immediately returned.\par \par \uc2 Although recording another person without their consent is illegal in Maryland, Proller said prosecutors told her that they were not going to pursue charges against her.\par \par \uc2 Proller, who according to an IMDB page has appeared on the \uc2 Netflix\uc2  TV series "House of Cards," said some of the details of her involvement in the Levy case sound like an episode of the show.\par \par \uc2 But she said she wanted to come forward to help Susan Levy, a grieving mother.\par \par \uc2 "I want the true person who did this to be found," Proller said. "The system failed and took attention away from somebody who really did it. It's a never-ending nightmare for this poor family, and they need closure."\par \par \uc2 lynh.bui@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 keith.alexander@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 scott.higham@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 Cheryl Thompson and Alice Crites contributed to this report. \par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com \par \par \uc2 WP20160729levy0729\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020160729ec7t0000w\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

Alexander;Scott Higham  \par \uc2 1,447 \uc2 words\par \uc2 29 July 2016\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved.  \par \par \uc2 Babs Proller met the man when she was living in a Maryland hotel. He had helped the local actress carry her dog, Buddy, to her fourth-floor room, and over the course of several days in early July, the two neighbors became friendly.\par \par \uc2 She soon learned that her new acquaintance, Armando Morales, was a convicted felon and former gang member, recently released after decades in prison. He was also the star witness in one of the Washington area's most sensational murder trials.\par \par \uc2 Proller eventually became suspicious of Morales and began recording hours of their conversations. Eventually, she contends, Morales revealed a secret that she caught on tape, telling her that he had lied when he testified in 2010 that a onetime cellmate had confessed to killing Chandra Levy.\par \par \uc2 Those clandestine recordings led to a stunning announcement by District prosecutors on Thursday that they would drop all charges against Ingmar Guandique, who was facing a retrial in the 2001 slaying of the federal intern, according to Proller and individuals familiar with the investigation.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2  could not independently verify the content of the recordings or the accuracy of Proller's description. The U.S. attorney's office would not comment on Proller's account and said only that "new information" uncovered this week had led prosecutors to conclude that they could not prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt.\par \par \uc2 Two officials with knowledge of the investigation declined to discuss details of the recordings but said that the audio led prosecutors to question Morales's credibility.\par \par \uc2 The dropped charges \u8212\'20\'14 coming just three months before the retrial was set to begin in the 15-year-old case \u8212\'20\'14 bolsters arguments made by Guandique and his attorneys, who have steadfastly said he was being wrongly held. They had insisted that Morales was making up his account to gain favor with authorities. It also leaves one of the nation's most infamous murder mysteries unresolved.\par \par \uc2 In a statement, the D.C. Public Defender Service noted that Guandique "has maintained since the beginning, when he passed an \uc2 FBI\uc2  administered lie detector test, that he did not kill Ms. Levy."\par \par \uc2 "It is now clear that the jailhouse informant, who was central to the government's case, was a perjurer who too easily manipulated the prosecutors," the attorneys said in the statement.\par \par \uc2 Levy was a 24-year-old intern with the \uc2 Federal Bureau of Prisons\uc2  when she disappeared on May 1, 2001. Her remains were found in 2002 in Rock Creek Park.\par \par \uc2 The intern's disappearance and killing captured national attention when it was revealed that she had an affair with then-Rep. Gary A. Condit (D-Calif.), who was married and 30 years her senior. Police initially focused on Condit as a suspect but later cleared him.\par \par \uc2 Years later, authorities charged Guandique in the case, alleging that he had killed Levy while she was jogging in Rock Creek Park. He had pleaded guilty to attacking two other women in the park about the same time Levy was killed, and prosecutors argued that he was a predator who also attacked Levy.\par \par \uc2 Proving their theory was difficult from the start. There was no forensic evidence and no eyewitness. The heart of the prosecution's case rested with Morales, who said he shared a cell at a Kentucky prison with Guandique in 2006.\par \par \uc2 Morales, a five-time convicted felon, captivated D.C. Superior Court with his testimony. He took the stand on the eighth day of the 2010 trial and was the first to directly link Guandique to Levy's death.\par \par \uc2 According to Morales, Guandique had said: "You don't understand. . . . Homeboy, I killed the [expletive], but I didn't rape her."\par \par \uc2 Morales told the jury that Guandique had said he saw Levy carrying a waist pouch and thought there would be cash inside. He recounted how he grabbed her from behind, Morales said, and dragged her off the trail.\par \par \uc2 She tried to fight, according to Morales's account of his cellmate's purported confession, but by the time Guandique got her into the bushes, she had stopped struggling. Morales testified that Guandique told him that he thought Levy was unconscious, not dead.\par \par \uc2 Guandique claimed that he took Levy's pouch and fled, Morales said.\par \par \uc2 "He said he never meant to kill her," Morales testified.\par \par \uc2 Morales said in court that Guandique confided in him because he feared he was about to be transferred to a new prison where inmates might view him as a rapist for the attacks on the two other women and target him in a way that they wouldn't target a killer.\par \par \uc2 Morales spoke slowly about the man he called "Chucky," a reference to the murderous doll in the 1988 horror movie "Child's Play." He pointed to Guandique in the courtroom and said Guandique had the nickname tattooed across his back. A photo of the tattoo was shown to the jury of 12 women and four men. Morales said he remembered the tattoo in part because "Chucky" was misspelled: C-h-a-c-k-y.\par \par \uc2 The men bonded over their gang affiliations. Morales, who pleaded guilty in 1997 to dealing cocaine and methamphetamine while armed, was serving a 21-year sentence. He was a founding member of the Fresno Bulldogs, a gang based in California and aligned with Guandique's gang, Mara Salvatrucha, or MS-13, prosecutors said at the time of trial.\par \par \uc2 At the close of the trial, Guandique was convicted and sentenced to 60 years in prison.\par \par \uc2 Over the following years, Guandique's attorneys challenged the conviction. They argued that it "was based on a lie" spun by Morales and said the government had failed to reveal that their witness had previously cooperated with law enforcement as a prison informant.\par \par \uc2 Last year, the conviction was overturned after prosecutors dropped their opposition to defense requests to have a new jury hear the case. The trial was set to begin in the fall.\par \par \uc2 In documents filed with the court, Guandique's defense attorneys said they were considering a strategy for trial in which they would argue that Condit or someone else had a motive to kill Levy.\par \par \uc2 In a statement released Thursday, Condit's attorney said the former congressman was "extremely disappointed" that the case had been dropped.\par \par \uc2 "The failure of authorities to bring formal closure to this tragedy after 15 years is very disappointing but in no way alters the fact that Mr. Condit was long ago completely exonerated by authorities in connection with Ms. Levy's death," the statement read.\par \par \uc2 Guandique, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from El Salvador, has been jailed awaiting retrial. After his release, he will be placed in the custody of \uc2 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2 , where he faces removal proceedings, officials said.\par \par \uc2 Proller said that she and Morales met July 6.\par \par \uc2 During their conversations, Proller said, Morales had threatened to hurt her ex-husband, which prompted her to begin recording their discussions. Proller said she thought the recordings could protect her and she didn't want to be implicated in any crimes against her ex-husband.\par \par \uc2 Proller sent The Post cellphone images of Morales's prison identification and photos of Morales.\par \par \uc2 Over the course of three days, "he told me his life story," Proller said. "He said he is a key witness in a major murder case."\par \par \uc2 According to Proller, he lied about Guandique's confession to improve his prison conditions and eventually struck a deal with prosecutors in exchange for his testimony.\par \par \uc2 Proller said she told Levy's mother, Susan Levy, about the recorded conversations with Morales. Susan Levy then contacted the authorities, Proller said. Proller said she turned over the recordings to prosecutors, with whom she has been in contact since Friday.\par \par \uc2 Calls to Susan Levy were not immediately returned.\par \par \uc2 Although recording another person without their consent is illegal in Maryland, Proller said prosecutors told her that they were not going to pursue charges against her.\par \par \uc2 Proller, who according to an IMDB page has appeared on the \uc2 Netflix\uc2  TV series "House of Cards," said some of the details of her involvement in the Levy case sound like an episode of the show.\par \par \uc2 But she said she wanted to come forward to help Susan Levy, a grieving mother.\par \par \uc2 "I want the true person who did this to be found," Proller said. "The system failed and took attention away from somebody who really did it. It's a never-ending nightmare for this poor family, and they need closure."\par \par \uc2 lynh.bui@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 keith.alexander@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 scott.higham@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020160728ec7s006hf\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The dark portrait of America that \uc2 Donald J. Trump\uc2  sketched in his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention is a compendium of doomsday stats that fall apart upon close scrutiny. Numbers are taken out of context, data is manipulated, and sometimes the facts are wrong.\par \par \uc2 When facts are inconveniently positive \u8212\'20\'14 such as rising incomes and an unemployment rate under 5\u160\'00\'A0percent \u8212\'20\'14 Trump simply declines to mention them. He describes an exceedingly violent nation, flooded with murders, when in reality, the violent-crime rate has been cut in half since the crack cocaine epidemic hit its peak in 1991.\par \par \uc2 In his speech, Trump promised to present "the plain facts that have been edited out of your nightly news and your morning newspaper." But he relies on statistics that are ripe for manipulation, citing misleading numbers on the economy, for example, through selective use of years, data and sources.\par \par \uc2 Here is a rundown of 25\u160\'00\'A0of Trump's key claims \u8212\'20\'14 and how they differ from reality \u8212\'20\'14 arranged by subject.\u160\'00\'A0As is our practice, we do not award Pinocchios for a roundup of claims made in convention events.\par \par \uc2 Crime\par \par \uc2 "Homicides last year increased by 17 percent in America's 50 largest cities. That's the largest increase in 25 years. In our nation's capital, killings have risen by 50 percent. They are up nearly 60 percent in nearby Baltimore."\par \par \uc2 Trump cherry-picks data to paint an alarming\u160\'00\'A0picture of homicide trends, when in reality, they have been declining for decades.\par \par \uc2 In 2015, there was an uptick in homicides in 36 of the 50 largest cities compared to the previous years. The rate did, indeed, increase nearly 17 percent, and it was the worst annual change since 1990. The homicide rate was up 54.3 percent in Washington, and 58.5 percent in Baltimore.\par \par \uc2 But in the first months of 2016, homicide trends were about evenly split in the major cities. Out of 63 agencies reporting to the Major Cities Chiefs Association, 32 cities saw a decrease in homicides in first quarter 2016 and 31 saw an increase.\par \par \uc2 The problem with cherry-picking such data is that crime trends are measured over decades of data. Many factors \u8212\'20\'14\u160\'00\'A0even weather \u8212\'20\'14 can drive crime numbers up or down at a given short period of time. In reality, homicides and overall violent crime, in both raw number and rates per population, have been on a decades-long decline in major cities.\par \par \uc2 "The debate over the size, scope and causes of the homicide increase in 2015 has been largely free of systematic evidence," according to a June 2016 Department of Justice report.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ec979837-c0b7-4b0b-906d-96eb4f5e8af2"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ec979837-c0b7-4b0b-906d-96eb4f5e8af2}}}\uc2  "The number of police officers killed in the line of duty has risen by almost 50 percent compared to this point last year."\par \par \uc2 This is wrong.\par \par \uc2 The number of law enforcement officers killed on the job has increased 8 percent compared to this point in 2015. He may be\u160\'00\'A0referring to the total\u160\'00\'A0 number of officers killed in shootings, which has increased 78 percent. This includes the recent shootings in Dallas and Baton Rouge.\par \par \uc2 The overall number of police deaths has decreased in the past two decades.\u160\'00\'A0For the past 10 to 15 years, traffic-related incidents (including criminal pursuit and instances where officers are intentionally struck by offenders) have been the leading cause of death among police officers.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 [Update: The Trump campaign responded to our fact-check and provided more information about the data they used for the speech. The campaign picked July 2014 to July 2015, and compared it to July 2015 to July 2016, using data from the Officers Down Memorial Page. The memorial page works with the \uc2 National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund\uc2 , whose data we cited initially for our fact-check, to update officer death data in real time.\par \par \uc2 This is not the standard way that both organizations and the \uc2 FBI\uc2  maintain police death data, which is by calendar year. The campaign said that\u160\'00\'A0it wanted to reflect the latest available data, to show police deaths have "been getting worse in recent days."]\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 "Decades of progress made in bringing down crime are now being reversed by this administration's rollback of criminal enforcement."\par \par \uc2 It's not clear what Trump is referring to here. Perhaps this is a reference to Obama's clemency initiative, granting early releases to prisoners with nonviolent drug offenses who have been serving mandatory sentences. Some critics of Obama's clemency policies have said they were concerned about the application process for clemency and whether the prisoners properly met all the criteria.\par \par \uc2 Trump also may be referring to the current efforts to overhaul the criminal justice system, specifically on sentencing policies. Legislation is making its way through Congress and has been pushed strongly by the White House. But this effort has bipartisan support and has brought together an unlikely coalition that includes \uc2 Koch Industries\uc2  and \uc2 the American Civil Liberties Union\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Immigration\par \par \uc2 "The number of new \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  families who have crossed the border so far this year\u160\'00\'A0 already exceeds the entire total from 2015. They are being released by the tens of thousands into our communities with no regard for the impact on public safety or resources."\par \par \uc2 This is another cherry-picked number. In the fiscal year that began in October, 51,152 families have been apprehended at the Southwest border through June, compared to 39,838 in fiscal year 2015, according to \uc2 U.S. Customs and Border Protection\uc2 . (There are three months left in the fiscal year.) But overall apprehensions, including unaccompanied minors, are running slightly higher than 2015 but are far fewer than 2014, 2013 and 2012.\par \par \uc2 There are Central American families arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border who are being allowed into the country pending review of their cases in immigration court. If they are being released, it is because they have requested asylum or intend to because they are fleeing extreme violence, instability and endemic poverty in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras.\par \par \uc2 "Nearly 180,000 illegal immigrants with criminal records, ordered deported from our country, are tonight roaming free to threaten peaceful citizens."\par \par \uc2 This number sounds worse than it really is. \uc2 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2  in fiscal 2015 deported nearly 140,000 convicted criminals. ICE has estimated that there are 953,507 noncitizens with final orders who are still in the United States, of whom 182,786 have been convicted of crimes; 176,126 have not been detained.\par \par \uc2 The actual crimes committed by this group are not documented, so Trump cannot easily claim all of these illegal immigrants are threatening.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Migration Policy Institute\uc2 , using a dataset of all 3.7 million deportations that were carried out between fiscal 2003 and 2013, found that the largest category of convictions for criminal deportees was immigration crimes, accounting for 18 percent of criminal removals between FY 2003-13. The three next largest crime categories were \uc2 FBI\uc2  Part 1 crimes (a definition that includes homicide, aggravated assault and burglary, 15 percent of criminal removals during the period), \uc2 FBI\uc2  Part 2 crimes identified by MPI as violent offenses (14 percent) and \uc2 FBI\uc2  Part 2 crimes identified by MPI as nonviolent offenses (14 percent).\par \par \uc2 Update: The Center for Immigration Studies points to data concerning illegal immigrants released from detention. For instance, in 2015, ICE released nearly 20,000, of whom there were about 8,000 violent\u160\'00\'A0convictions and about 200 homicides; the most common crime was driving under the influence. \uc2 Jessica Vaughan\uc2  of CIS also wrote a critique of our fact check.)\par \par \uc2 "Decades of record immigration have produced lower wages and higher unemployment for our citizens, especially for African American and Latino workers."\par \par \uc2 This claim is quite convoluted, and the impact of legal and illegal immigration on blacks and Latinos is\u160\'00\'A0more complicated than Trump describes it.\par \par \uc2 Trump does not discern between legal and unauthorized immigration. Legal immigration flow has increased in the past four decades, and has remained at roughly 1 million people obtaining lawful permanent resident status every year since 2001. \u160\'00\'A0The unauthorized immigrant population increased from about 4 million in 1990 to about 12 million in 2007. But researchers estimate net zero illegal immigration flow from 2007 to 2014, due to the number of unauthorized immigrants leaving the country after the economic recession. Preliminary research from 2015 suggests net illegal immigration may have increased.\par \par \uc2 In general, economists have found that immigration overall results in a net positive to the U.S. economy and to overall workers. There are slight negative effects, but they are felt most strongly by less-educated and low-skilled workers.\u160\'00\'A0Illegal immigration, in particular, tends to affect less-educated and low-skilled American workers the most, which disproportionately comprises black men and recently arrived low-educated legal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 U.S. Commission on Civil Rights\uc2  2010 report found that illegal immigration has tended to depress wages and employment particularly for black men. But factors other than illegal immigration contribute to black unemployment, the report found, including the high school dropout rate and low job-retention rates.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 The competition with other Latinos, particularly Latino immigrants, is the most intense in industries like construction, agriculture, manufacturing and service jobs, said\u160\'00\'A0\uc2 Randy Capps\uc2 , the Migration Policy Institute's director of research of U.S. programs. But the consensus among economic research studies is that the impact of immigration is primarily a net positive.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 "One such border-crosser was released and made his way to Nebraska. There, he ended\u160\'00\'A0the life of an innocent young girl named Sarah Root. She was 21 years old and was killed the\u160\'00\'A0day after graduating from college with a 4.0 grade point average. Her killer was then released a second time, and he is now a fugitive from the law."\par \par \uc2 Sarah Root is a relatively new anecdote of \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 's, though her story has been cited often by other immigration hard-liners.\par \par \uc2 Root, 21, died in a car crash 16 hours after she graduated summa cum laude from \uc2 Bellevue University\uc2  in Nebraska. \u160\'00\'A0She was driving home and\u160\'00\'A0was struck by a man whose blood alcohol level was more than three times the legal limit, and who was speeding in a truck.\par \par \uc2 The man was Eswin Mejia, 19, who was in the United States illegally. He was born in Honduras and arrived in America at age 16. He was released on bail, and fled. Authorities have not been able to\u160\'00\'A0find him, as of July 2016.\par \par \uc2 Mejia had several run-ins with law enforcement, but officials said he was not detained because he was not an "enforcement priority" and had no prior criminal convictions, according to the Des Moines Register.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Economy\par \par \uc2 "Fifty-eight percent of African American youth are not employed."\par \par \uc2 The official unemployment rate for black youth is about half of what Trump says it is.\par \par \uc2 According to the \uc2 Bureau of Labor Statistics\uc2 , the unemployment rate among blacks 16 to 19 years old was 31.2 percent in June 2016. \u160\'00\'A0This official unemployment rate refers to jobless people who are actively looking for jobs, as a percentage of the total available workforce of people who are working or are looking for jobs.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 What Trump may be referring to, as our friends at PolitiFact Virginia noted, is the \uc2 BLS\uc2  employment-population ratio. This is a broad measure that refers to the ratio of the number of people employed compared to the total population, including people who are not looking for jobs.\u160\'00\'A0The employment-population ratio for blacks 16 to 24 years old was 42 percent in June 2016, so Trump maybe using the flip side of that \u8212\'20\'14 58 percent, for the unemployment-population ratio.\par \par \uc2 "2 million more Latinos are in poverty today than when the president took his oath of office."\par \par \uc2 Trump is being misleading here, turning a good news story into something negative by using raw numbers and using 2008 as a base, instead of 2009, when Obama took office. From March 2009 to March, 2014, the most recent year for which data is available, the number of Latinos in poverty has increased 750,000, according to the Census Bureau. But the overall number of Latinos has grown by nearly 7 million, so the percentage in poverty has declined from 25.3 percent to 23.6 percent.\par \par \uc2 "Another 14 million people have left the workforce entirely."\par \par \uc2 This is yet another misleading figure. The number of people who have left the workforce has certainly increased since 2009, though this is usually expressed as the labor participation rate, not raw employment numbers. The labor participation rate has dropped under Obama, from 65.7 percent in 2009 to 62.7 percent, but experts say just over half of the post-1999 decline in the participation rate comes from the retirement of the baby boomers. Economists estimate that just 15 percent of the drop in the labor force stems from people who want a job and are of prime working age (25-54).\par \par \uc2 "Household incomes are down more than $4,000 since the year 2000."\par \par \uc2 This is a stale statistic, based on 2014 Census data, which ignores the fact that incomes have risen sharply in the last two years.\par \par \uc2 A more up-to-date figure is obtained from the nonpartisan economic consulting firm\u160\'00\'A0Sentier Research, which produces a monthly report using data from the Census Bureau's monthly household survey.\par \par \uc2 The most recent report, released on the day of Trump's speech, shows median annual household income in June was $57,206, slightly below the income of $57,826 in January 2000, in 2016 dollars. So it is essentially flat, not down $4,000.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/b06e1f30-1240-4027-8b41-bfb435892785"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/b06e1f30-1240-4027-8b41-bfb435892785}}}\uc2  "Forty-three million Americans are on food stamps."\par \par \uc2 Trump's point was that America's economy has suffered under the Obama administration. But he fails to mention that this is actually the lowest number of people receiving food stamps since it reached its peak in 2013,\u160\'00\'A0a sign that the economy is finally improving enough that the delayed impact of economic recovery has reached families who depend on them.\par \par \uc2 There are 43.6 million people enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the official name for food stamps, as of the most recent monthly data available from April 2016. It was the lowest number of monthly enrollees since November 2010, \uc2 U.S. Department of Agriculture\uc2  data show.\par \par \uc2 The number of people receiving SNAP benefits\u160\'00\'A0increased after Obama took office\u160\'00\'A0in part because of changes in the food stamp program under President George W. Bush, when Congress overrode his veto of the 2008 Farm Bill. That law boosted the purchasing power of food stamps by indexing key elements to inflation.\par \par \uc2 At the same time, Obama's stimulus bill also temporarily boosted benefits even more. The Obama administration also announced that it was pushing to expand eligibility, in part on the theory that expanding the food stamp program is also good for the economy because the money is quickly spent.\par \par \uc2 Of course, the economic aftershocks of the Great Recession, which was in full force before Obama took office, has a lot to do with the increase. There often is a time lag between when economic disaster strikes and when people begin to apply for food-stamp assistance. We explored these reasons in a 2011 fact check.\par \par \uc2 "America is one of the highest-taxed nations in the world."\par \par \uc2 As a billionaire, Trump probably personally faces high tax rates. But the statistics don't lie \u8212\'20\'14 the United States isn't anywhere near the top among industrialized nations.\par \par \uc2 In 2014, according to\u160\'00\'A0comparative tables\u160\'00\'A0of the \uc2 Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development\uc2  (\uc2 OECD\uc2 ), revenue as a percentage of the gross domestic product \u8212\'20\'14 the broadest measure of the economy \u8212\'20\'14 was 26 percent for the United States.\par \par \uc2 Out of 34 countries, that put the United States in the bottom third \u8212\'20\'14 and well below the \uc2 OECD\uc2  average of 34.4 percent.\par \par \uc2 Still, it's an advance that Trump now says the United States is one of the highest-taxed nations. He used to assert the United States was the highest-taxed nation \u8212\'20\'14 when that dubious honor actually belongs to Denmark, with revenue at 50.9 percent of GDP.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/334968a1-608f-4d45-a5db-056d9d65646a"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/334968a1-608f-4d45-a5db-056d9d65646a}}}\uc2  "Excessive regulation is costing our country as much as $2 trillion a year."\par \par \uc2 Trump presents an unbalanced figure here.\par \par \uc2 Various organizations, such as the \uc2 Small Business Administration\uc2 , the National Association of Manufacturers and the Competitive Enterprise \u160\'00\'A0Institute have come up with similar estimates on the cost of regulations. We have in the past looked deeply at the methodological issues concerning this $2 trillion estimate, which can be found in previous fact checks from 2014 and 2011.\par \par \uc2 But there is an important\u160\'00\'A0element missing in the use of this somewhat sketchy figure \u8212\'20\'14 the benefit side of the analysis. Every regulation has costs \u8212\'20\'14 but also benefits.\par \par \uc2 Look at cars, for example. Seat belts are a regulation, but they also result in fewer deaths, which is presumably a benefit. Higher fuel-economy standards raise the initial cost of a car, but also result in savings on gasoline over time.\par \par \uc2 Foreign Policy\par \par \uc2 "This was just prior to the signing of the Iran deal, which gave back to Iran $150 billion and\u160\'00\'A0 gave us absolutely nothing \u8212\'20\'14\u160\'00\'A0it will go down in history as one of the worst deals ever made."\par \par \uc2 Trump frequently misstates the facts about the Iran deal, making it sound like the United States simply shipped $150 billion of taxpayer's funds to Iran.\par \par \uc2 This was always Iran's money, frozen in banks around the world, but $150 billion is the high estimate of the money that could be received. The Treasury Department says the figure is in the range of $100 to $125 billion, but the usual liquid assets would only be about $50 billion, as the rest of the assets are either obligated in illiquid projects (such as over 50 projects with China) that cannot be monetized quickly, if at all, or are composed of outstanding loans to Iranian entities that cannot repay them.\par \par \uc2 For its part, the \uc2 Central Bank of Iran\uc2 \u160\'00\'A0said\u160\'00\'A0the number was actually $32 billion.\par \par \uc2 Reasonable people can disagree on the merits of the Iran deal, but it's a stretch to say "nothing" was received. Iran's nuclear program was certainly put on ice for at least a decade.\par \par \uc2 "In Libya, our consulate \u8212\'20\'14 the symbol of American prestige around the globe \u8212\'20\'14 was brought down in flames."\par \par \uc2 Trump falsely calls the Benghazi facility a "consulate"\u160\'00\'A0 and a "symbol of American prestige." It was merely an unofficial and temporary facility that had not even been declared to the host government \u8212\'20\'14 which is a key reason it did not get the security that was needed.\par \par \uc2 "In 2009, pre-Hillary, ISIS was not even on the map. Libya was cooperating. Egypt was peaceful. Iraq was seeing a reduction in violence. Iran was being choked by sanctions. Syria was somewhat under control."\par \par \uc2 This is an interesting list, but aspects are not factually correct.\par \par \uc2 The Islamic State of today is simply an outgrowth of \uc2 al-Qaeda in Iraq\uc2 . It was established in April 2004 by longtime Sunni extremist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, according to the \uc2 National Counterterrorism Center\uc2 . Zarqawi was killed by a U.S. airstrike in 2006, and afterward his successor announced the formation of the Islamic State \u8212\'20\'14 more than two years before George W. Bush left office.\par \par \uc2 The Islamic State\u160\'00\'A0certainly gained strength and territory from the civil war in Syria, but Clinton as secretary of state had pressed to funnel arms to the rebels; she was rebuffed by the president.\par \par \uc2 Libya, Syria and Egypt were run by dictators in 2009, but it's odd to somehow suggest the 2011 uprising in those countries against the repressive regimes had much to do with U.S. policy.\par \par \uc2 As for sanctions against Iran, they did not really begin to bite until new ones were imposed by the Obama administration under the direction of \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "Only weeks ago, in Orlando, Florida, 49 wonderful Americans were savagely murdered by an Islamic terrorist. This time, the terrorist targeted our LGBTQ community."\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 FBI\uc2  has found\u160\'00\'A0no evidence so far\u160\'00\'A0that the shooter\u160\'00\'A0targeted Pulse night club in Orlando because it is a gay club.\par \par \uc2 The shooting rattled the LGBT community in Orlando and beyond, who felt they were targeted in a hateful attack. But there is no evidence yet that the shooter's attack was motivated by homophobia, The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2  reported on July 16.\par \par \uc2 "My opponent, in Syria \u8212\'20\'14 think of this, think of this, this is not believable but this is what's happening. A 550 percentage increase in Syrian refugees on top of the existing massive refugee flows coming into our country already under the leadership of President Obama.\u160\'00\'A0She proposes this\u160\'00\'A0despite the fact that there's no way to screen these refugees in order to find out who they are or where they come from."\par \par \uc2 Trump gets it right on the "550" percentage, but falsely claims there's "no way to screen" refugees.\par \par \uc2 President Obama has proposed accepting 10,000 refugees in fiscal year 2016, and in September Clinton said she would like to move toward as many as 65,000 . That's where Trump gets his "550 percent." Clinton has emphasized there would be careful screening, with an emphasis on those facing religious persecution.\par \par \uc2 The\u160\'00\'A0process of vetting refugees starts with the \uc2 United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees\uc2  and then continues with checks by U.S. intelligence and security agencies.

The specific claim Trump is citing is in bold.\par \par \uc2 Rachel Maddow: The reason they [Republicans] are able to propose something that radical [privatizing the \uc2 Department of Veterans Affairs\uc2 ] is because the problems at the VA seem so intractable.

Do you have any new ideas for trying to fix it? You can't find a person in politics who doesn't say we shouldn't do right by our veterans. But for some reason, this can't get fixed fast enough.\par \par \uc2 Clinton was criticized immediately,\u160\'00\'A0and\u160\'00\'A0her campaign\u160\'00\'A0later clarified that Clinton does believe there is a systemic problem of delays in veterans' access to health care and processing their disability claims. The campaign told The Fact Checker that she was "speaking with reference to Republicans who have sought to use the wait times scandal to suggest the VA is so incompetent as to be beyond fixing, such that the only fix is privatization."\par \par \uc2 Still, we awarded her Two Pinocchios for saying that\u160\'00\'A0a "number of surveys" show veterans "are satisfied with their treatment."\u160\'00\'A0She was referring to VA satisfaction surveys funded by the VA or a nonscientific survey of veterans' attitudes. Independent, scientific surveys show veterans' attitudes toward medical care at the VA are mixed.\par \par \uc2 Trade\par \par \uc2 "America has lost nearly-one third of its manufacturing jobs since 1997, following the enactment of disastrous trade deals supported by Bill and \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 ."\par \par \uc2 Trump picks a high point for manufacturing jobs, in Clinton's second term, and ignores that fact that nearly 1 million manufacturing jobs have been added since the low point after the Great Recession. It is simplistic to pin all of the blame on trade agreements, when efficiency and technology have also played a major role.\par \par \uc2 "Remember, it was \uc2 Bill Clinton\uc2  who signed \uc2 NAFTA\uc2 , one of the worst economic deals ever\u160\'00\'A0 made by our country."\par \par \uc2 Bill Clinton\uc2  was certainly a supporter of \uc2 NAFTA\uc2  who pushed approval through Congress. But it was\u160\'00\'A0negotiated and signed\u160\'00\'A0by President George H.W. Bush. (Here's a photo.) Moreover, more Republicans than Democrats voted for the deal, as the trade pact was vehemently opposed by labor unions. One key ally for Clinton was then-House Minority Whip (and later House speaker) \uc2 Newt Gingrich\uc2  (R-Ga.), now a Trump supporter.\par \par \uc2 Clinton did put his political prestige on the line to get it approved by Congress \u8212\'20\'14 even as two top Democrats, House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt (Mo.) and House Majority Whip David Bonior (Mich.), opposed it. In the House, \uc2 NAFTA\uc2 \u160\'00\'A0passed 234-200; 132 Republicans and 102 Democrats voted in favor of it. The Senate\u160\'00\'A0approved \uc2 NAFTA\uc2  61-38, with the backing of 34 Republicans and 27 Democrats.\par \par \uc2 In both the House and the Senate, more Democrats voted against \uc2 NAFTA\uc2  than for it \u8212\'20\'14 a signal that the Bernie Sanders wing of the Democratic Party was strong even then. Clinton held\u160\'00\'A0a signing ceremony\u160\'00\'A0for the implementing legislation on Dec. 3, 1993, flanked by former presidents and congressional leaders of both parties. But that's not the same as negotiating and signing the treaty with Mexico and Canada. The trade agreement went into effect on Jan. 1, 1994.\par \par \uc2 As we have noted repeatedly before, economists have not reached any firm conclusion on the impact of \uc2 NAFTA\uc2 , but many think that\u160\'00\'A0claims of massive job losses are overstated. The \uc2 Congressional Research Service\uc2  in 2015\u160\'00\'A0concluded\u160\'00\'A0that the "net overall effect of \uc2 NAFTA\uc2  on the U.S. economy appears to have been relatively modest, primarily because trade with Canada and Mexico accounts for a small percentage of U.S. GDP [gross domestic product]."\par \par \uc2 "She [\uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 ] has supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which\u160\'00\'A0will not only destroy our manufacturing, but it will make America subject to the rulings of foreign governments."\par \par \uc2 It's a matter of opinion that the Trans-Pacific Partnership will "destroy" manufacturing \u8212\'20\'14\u160\'00\'A0most economists would disagree \u8212\'20\'14 but the other part of Trump's statement is fantasy sometimes promoted by the far-left. TPP, like other trade deals, does establish a commission to monitor implementation. It periodically may make suggestions on changes that are needed in the agreement as the global economy modernizes, but those changes have to be carried out through domestic processes.\par \par \uc2 All TPP members are already part of the \uc2 World Trade Organization\uc2 . It settles trade disputes and can allow for monetary retaliation. But the dispute settlement rulings cannot force changes in U.S. laws.\par \par \uc2 (About our rating scale)\par \par \uc2 Send us facts to check by filling out this form\par \par \uc2 Check out our 2016 candidates fact-check page\par \par \uc2 Sign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletter\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020160722ec7m001md\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 morning-mix\par {\*\bkmkstart toc50}{\*\bkmkend toc50}\b \uc2 The story of Sarah Root, who Trump said was sacrificed 'on the altar of open borders' ; The death of their daughter after a traffic accident involving an undocumented immigrant sent Scott Root and his wife Michelle into a rage and on a personal crusade,\b0\par\par\uc2 By Fred Barbash \par \uc2 1,548 \uc2 words\par \uc2 25 July 2016\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 It was four\u160\'00\'A0in the morning on Jan. 31 when Scott Root received the call every parent dreads, summoning him to a hospital in Omaha, Neb., about an accident involving his 21-year-old daughter Sarah, but not telling him then, over the phone, just how dreadful it was.\par \par \uc2 "I thought we had to deal with a broken leg or a broken arm," he would later say before a congressional committee. "I didn't dare to think the worst."\par \par \uc2 Only when he arrived was he informed of her condition. "Her spinal cord was snapped and her skull fractured in two places," he said. Her chances of recovery, the neurosurgeon told him, were zero. Her face, he said, was swollen beyond recognition.\par \par \uc2 He had been summoned not to comfort his daughter but to identify her.\par \par \uc2 "We identified her by her tattoo on her rib cage 'Live, Laugh, Love' and a crucifix . \u8230\'20\'26 Her mother and I kept her on life support three days to allow organ recipients and their doctors to prepare themselves for harvesting."\par \par \uc2 She had been out that night and morning celebrating her graduation from \uc2 Bellevue University\uc2 , near Omaha, with friends. As she stopped at a light in her white Oldsmobile Bravada SUV, a Chevy pickup driving at a high rate of speed slammed into her, ramming the SUV and sending it about 800 feet along the road, crushing it so badly that the rear and front of the car had become fused.\par \par \uc2 Police would later determine that the truck's driver was street racing and drunk, according to the Des Moines Register.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 The driver of the pickup, identified by police as Eswin G. Mejia, was brought to the same hospital and then transferred to the Douglas County Jail. His blood alcohol content was 0.241, the Register reported, three times the legal limit. Later that day, he was charged with motor vehicular homicide.\par \par \uc2 Judge Jeffrey Marcuzzo set his bond at $50,000, meaning he had to post $5,000 to get out of jail, which a relative managed to do. He was released four days later. He was ordered back for mandatory drug screening on Feb.\u160\'00\'A08 but never showed. He disappeared and remains a fugitive sought by authorities to this day.\par \par \uc2 Sarah Root, declared Trump as he tore into Obama's immigration policies, was "just one more American life that wasn't worth protecting. One more child to sacrifice on the altar of open borders."\par \par \uc2 Mejia was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . But, in fact, the story is much more complex than Trump's portrayal would suggest. Mejia did cross the border illegally in 2013 from Honduras. But the two newspapers that closely examined the case, the Des Moines Register and the \uc2 Omaha World-Herald\uc2 , found an overall system malfunction that only partly involved U.S. immigration officials. The judge who released Mejia, for example, appears not to have been informed of Mejia's failure to show up for two prior court appearances, making him a potential flight risk.\par \par \uc2 Trump's broader data about open borders, the context for which he invoked the death of Root, was "cherry picked" according to the \uc2 Washington Post\uc2 's Fact Checker,\u160\'00\'A0and his rhetoric about illegal immigrants ordered deported who are "roaming free to threaten peaceful citizens," as Fact Checker said, is exaggerated at best and not supported by evidence, only anecdotes, as there is no documentation of the number of illegal immigrants committing crimes.\par \par \uc2 The young woman's parents, however, have no doubt that the immigration system is in need of change. They have become activists for tightening the laws and regulations governing detention of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  through a bill called "Sarah's Law."\u160\'00\'A0They issued a statement last night thanking Trump, something particularly noteworthy for the mother, Michelle Root, who has said she twice voted for \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  for president.\par \par \uc2 Some of their ire about Mejia's release is directed at the judge, and some at U.S. immigration officials and immigration law. Omaha police, according to the Register and the World-Herald, reached out to \uc2 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2  (ICE) in an effort to obtain a "detainer," which could have kept Mejia's in custody.\par \par \uc2 But police said the agency declined the detainer. An ICE spokesman told the Register that they declined because Mejia had not been convicted of a criminal charge. He was not, they would say, an "enforcement priority."\par \par \uc2 And in May 2013, after he entered the country illegally at age 16, immigration authorities confirmed to the Register, he was stopped by the Border Patrol in Arizona but then placed with a brother in Tennessee while waiting for a deportation hearing. The family ultimately relocated to Nebraska.\par \par \uc2 Shawn Neudauer, a spokesman for ICE, told the World-Herald that Mejia's Jan. 31 arrest "'did not meet ICE's enforcement priorities' as stated in a November 2014 federal memo issued by Jeh C. Johnson, secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. 'Due to limited resources, DHS and its components (including ICE) cannot respond to all immigration violations or remove all persons illegally in the United States,' Johnson wrote."\par \par \uc2 "An individual from ICE looked at the specific facts and circumstances related to that matter," ICE's director, Sarah Salda\u241\'00\'F1a, would later tell a congressional committee grilling her about that and other cases, and because "this individual had no criminal convictions, previous criminal convictions \u8230\'20\'26 made a determination based on his judgment that he did not need to be detained."\par \par \uc2 Though he was listed in booking documents as an "alien," according to the Register's investigation, word that he was illegally in the country apparently did not reach the judge, who may or may not have taken it into account anyway as he set bond.\par \par \uc2 In addition, it turned out that this was not the first brush with the law in Omaha for Mejia nor the first time he had skipped out on court-ordered appearances, which suggested he was a flight risk. He had been arrested by police in 2014 and 2015 for driving violations, including driving the wrong way on a one-way street and having no valid driver's license, and had failed to appear in court as ordered for either charge, according to records examined by the World-Herald.\par \par \uc2 Given those facts, the family was furious that Mejia was released by the judge and is pursuing disciplinary action against him. According to the Register's examination of court records, however, "no mention was made during the bond hearing about Mejia's immigration status or that he had failed to appear at two previous court hearings.\par \par \uc2 "Donald W. Kleine, county attorney for Douglas County, told the Register that prosecutors weren't aware that Mejia was in the country illegally."\par \par \uc2 The death of his daughter and the release of Mejia sent\u160\'00\'A0Scott Root and his wife, Michelle, into a rage and on a personal crusade, as he would express it to the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, "to be the voice of my murdered daughter, Sarah Rae-Ann Root, murdered on Sunday, January 31st at approximately 2:00 AM by a drunk driver and \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , Edwin G. Mejia."\par \par \uc2 The family, which resides in Council Bluffs, Iowa, carried their cause to Iowa's Republican Sens. \uc2 Charles Grassley\uc2  and Joni Ernst who, among others, would make the grieving parents' cause their own.\par \par \uc2 Just met with courageous family of Sarah Root in Nebraska. Sarah was horribly killed by \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , but leaves behind amazing legacy.\par \par \uc2 And Michelle Root, according to Slate, would meet with Trump in Iowa in May where they discussed Sarah's Law. The bill, among other things,\u160\'00\'A0would require ICE "to take custody of an individual who is in the country illegally and is charged with a crime resulting in the death or serious bodily injury of another person."\par \par \uc2 Trump used the tragedy to attack the Obama administration in his speech Thursday night:\par \par \uc2 The number of new \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  families who have crossed the border so far this year already exceeds the entire total from 2015. They are being released by the tens of thousands into our communities with no regard for the impact on public safety or resources.\par \par \uc2 While Trump's audience in Cleveland cheered in support, not everyone thought as much of using Sarah Root's tragedy as a line in a partisan speech.\par \par \uc2 Sarah Root's death is a result of failure to comply with the law, rather than illegal immigration. #drdsusgov\par \par \uc2 Slate's headline called it the "most odious line" of the speech. "Merits of Sarah's Law and the tragedy of her story aside, the way Trump's speech uses her death is one of the greatest shames of this convention."\par \par \uc2 But the Root family was grateful.\par \par \uc2 "We are very appreciative," the family said in a statement after Trump's acceptance speech, "that Mr. Trump is speaking of our daughter. He & his staff have been very compassionate about what we have been going through & have tried to help however they can."\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020160722ec7m002xl\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

Dionne Jr. \par \uc2 786 \uc2 words\par \uc2 22 July 2016\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 CLEVELAND -- Perhaps you thought, or hoped, that \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  would use his acceptance speech to offer a softer tone, to sketch a more compassionate vision of the nation, or to reach out to skeptics and former opponents.\par \par \uc2 Trump chose a different path -- or, more precisely, the same path he has taken from the outset of the campaign. Trump will be running as Trump, the candidate of the angriest wing of the Republican Party and the most disaffected members of the American electorate.\par \par \uc2 He will run as a hard man, a tough, nationalist authoritarian for whom order is paramount. And he will advance his case by offering a dismal and profoundly gloomy account of what he called "a moment of crisis for our nation."\par \par \uc2 "The attacks on our police, and the terrorism in our cities, threaten our very way of life, he declared. "Any politician who does not grasp this danger is not fit to lead our country." He spoke of a nation characterized by "violence in our streets and the chaos in our communities."\par \par \uc2 He blamed \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  for of "death, destruction, terrorism and weakness."\par \par \uc2 He cherry-picked statistics to suggest that the nation is in the midst of a wave of criminality at a moment of historically low crime numbers. He manipulated the facts on immigration, suggesting huge flows of illegal entrants after a long period of low or even negative immigration. If reality does not conform to what Trump needs reality to be to support his case, he will invent a new reality.\par \par \uc2 He explicitly reached out to supporters of Bernie Sanders, to "the laid-off factory workers," and to "the communities crushed by our horrible and unfair trade deals." The billionaire will run as a populist and cast Clinton as a politician supported by "big business, elite media and major donors" committed to keeping "our rigged system in place."\par \par \uc2 "She is their puppet," he said, "and they pull the strings."\par \par \uc2 But economics took second place behind crime and immigration. His language was incendiary and often demagogic.\par \par \uc2 He claimed that the Obama Administration was indifferent to the fate of a young woman killed by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , saying it viewed her as "one more child to sacrifice on the altar of open borders." It is hard to imagine any other presidential candidate making such a charge.\par \par \uc2 And he repeatedly presented himself as a national savior who would single-handedly reverse the tide of lawlessness. "I have a message to every last person threatening the peace on our streets and the safety of our police," Trump said. "When I take the oath of office next year, I will restore law and order to our country."\par \par \uc2 He came back to this idea again and again. "On January 21st of 2017, the day after I take the oath of office," he said, "Americans will finally wake up in a country where the laws of the United States are enforced."\par \par \uc2 And lest anyone miss his point, he put it in rhetorical italics: "I am the law and order candidate."\par \par \uc2 As a political matter, Trump made clear he will be a moving target. Like leaders of the European far right, he combined economic nationalism ("America First") and populism (he pledged to be the voice of the "forgotten men and women of our country") with his hard line on crime, immigration and "political correctness."\par \par \uc2 His daughter Ivanka's speech which included a strong focus on gender equality and workplace fairness, suggested he will freely try to steal \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 's best issues.\par \par \uc2 But his core strategy is rooted not only in exploiting the fears of Americans but in heightening them. He will repeat his calls for "law and order" again and again. A man who has spent his life among the country's wealthiest and most influential people will make the "elites" his whipping boy. He will paint a dark picture of his foes as serving interests other than those of their fellow citizens: "Americanism not globalism will be our credo."\par \par \uc2 And he will play racial politics by accusing President \uc2 Obama\uc2 , as he did Thursday, of using "the pulpit of the presidency to divide us by race and color" and making "America a more dangerous environment for everyone."\par \par \uc2 We are thus about to have the ugliest and most divisive presidential campaign in our history. Trump is an effective demagogue. Republicans have allowed him to take over their party. It falls to the rest of the country to resist being seduced by anger, resentment and fear.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020160722ec7m001gw\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 wonkblog\par {\*\bkmkstart toc52}{\*\bkmkend toc52}\b \uc2 However divided you think our politics are, this chart shows that it's actually way worse ; A new study tracks an "explosion" of polarized speech in the past 20 years.\b0\par\par\uc2 By Christopher Ingraham \par \uc2 947 \uc2 words\par \uc2 22 July 2016\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 A wide-ranging new analysis of congressional-floor speeches finds that political polarization has "exploded" over the past 20 years,\u160\'00\'A0and is now "far greater today than at any point in the past."\par \par \uc2 The study, by economists at Stanford and Brown universities and the \uc2 University of Chicago\uc2 , analyzed the entirety of the congressional record going back to 1873.\u160\'00\'A0The researchers built a sophisticated model capable of measuring how easy it would be for a typical listener to guess a speaker's political party based on the words the speaker used in one minute of speech.\par \par \uc2 The results were striking: from the 1870s until roughly 1990, "partisanship was low and roughly constant," according to the analysis of congressional language. In most years during that time period, a listener would have a little more than a 50 percent chance of "correctly guessing a speaker's party based on a one-minute speech."\par \par \uc2 But in recent years political language has changed dramatically. "Beginning with the congressional election of 1994, partisanship\u160\'00\'A0turned sharply upward, with the probability of guessing correctly based on a one-minute\u160\'00\'A0speech climbing to 83 percent by the 110th session (2007-09)."\par \par \uc2 To conduct the analysis, the researchers looked for "partisan phrases" \u8212\'20\'14\u160\'00\'A0phrases whose removal from a speech would make it harder to infer a speaker's political leanings. Those phrases have changed greatly over time.\par \par \uc2 In the late 1800s, hot-button phrases were related to discussions of tariffs and protectionism, such as "tariff tax," "increase duties" or "fisheries treaty." These were phrases that showed up in party platforms relating to the big political debates of the day.\par \par \uc2 By the late 1960s, Democrats were aggressively trying to expand the federal safety net. Phrases like "food stamps" and "school lunch" carried highly partisan connotations. And by the mid-2000s, the partisan contours of our present-day political fights come into focus. Phrases like "\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 " and "higher taxes" become associated with Republican partisanship, while Democrats begin leaning on terminology related to drawing down the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\par \par \uc2 According to the study, the rise in partisanship is not only about changes in political topics. The parties have always fought over things like taxation, immigration and the proper role of government. It's due, rather, to the choice of language that partisans use to frame the debates \u8212\'20\'14\u160\'00\'A0changing "estate tax" to "death tax," for instance, or subtly morphing "global warming" to "climate change."\par \par \uc2 The introduction of these novel and ideologically skewed methods of framing debates starts right around the mid-1990s, leading to the abrupt and dramatic rise in partisanship since then. According to the economists' analysis, that's no accident, and it can all be traced primarily back to one seismic event: the Republican takeover of Congress in 1994, and the rise of House Speaker \uc2 Newt Gingrich\uc2  and his "Contract with America."\par \par \uc2 That year, Republicans took control of the House for the first time in 40 years. "This election is widely considered a watershed\u160\'00\'A0moment in political marketing, as consultants such as Frank Luntz applied novel focus-group\u160\'00\'A0technologies to identify effective language and disseminate it broadly to candidates," the economists write. You may recall Luntz as the man credited with identifying the persuasive power of some of the terms mentioned above, like "death tax" and "climate change."\par \par \uc2 To test their theory on the primacy of the Gingrich Revolution, the economists extracted all the phrases used in the famous Luntz-tested, Luntz-approved "Contract with America" and ran the same analysis on them alone. This chart from their paper shows that the use of these phrases spiked in 1994 and has remained historically high since, and that they tend to be highly partisan in use.\par \par \uc2 This new analysis has some important similarities and differences with other measures of polarization. The most well-known partisanship metric is based on lawmakers'\u160\'00\'A0votes, not on their speech. That measure partisanship rising sharply in the modern era.\par \par \uc2 But the vote-based measure shows the increase starting in about\u160\'00\'A0the 1970s, rather than the mid-1990s. And it also shows a high degree of polarization back in the late 1800s. This has led many political scientists to argue that our current divided politics aren't necessarily an anomaly, but rather a return to a historic norm after a period of relative partisan unity.\par \par \uc2 But the economists' analysis of political language tells a very different story, one in which the current state of partisan warfare is unprecedented. You can see how the two measures differ in the following chart from the economists' paper.\par \par \uc2 These two analyses aren't necessarily contradictory. "Speech and roll-call votes should not be seen as two different manifestations of a single underlying ideological dimension," the economists write. "Rather, speech appears to respond to a distinct set of incentives and constraints."\par \par \uc2 It may boil down to a difference between action and speech. Politicians\u160\'00\'A0today may be voting along partisan lines similar to how lawmakers worked in the late 1800s. But today's political rhetoric \u8212\'20\'14\u160\'00\'A0the ways lawmakers frame their arguments and try to portray the arguments of the opposing side \u8212\'20\'14\u160\'00\'A0may be more radically divided than they've been at any point in the historic record.\par \par \uc2 In other words, "Democrats and Republicans now speak different languages to a far greater degree than ever before," the study concludes. If it seems like today's politicians are talking past one another, rather than to one another, it may be because that's exactly what they're doing.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020160722ec7m004ms\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Below are \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 's remarks accepting the Republican nomination as delivered. Where text is in bolded, it denotes a place where Trump's comment deviated from the original draft that leaked to the press.\par \par \uc2 Friends, delegates and fellow Americans: I humbly and gratefully accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States.\par \par \uc2 USA! USA!\par \par \uc2 Who would have believed that when we started this journey on June 16th of last year we \u8212\'20\'14 and I say "we" because we are a team \u8212\'20\'14 would have received almost 14 million votes, the most in the history of the Republican Party, and that the Republican Party would get 60 percent more votes than it received four years ago.\par \par \uc2 The Democrats, on the other hand, received almost 20 percent fewer votes than they got four years ago.\par \par \uc2 Together, we will lead our party back to the White House, and we will lead our country back to safety, prosperity, and peace. We will be a country of generosity and warmth. But we will also be a country of law and order.\par \par \uc2 We will be a country of generosity and warmth. But we will also be a country of law and order.\par \par \uc2 Our Convention occurs at a moment of crisis for our nation. The attacks on our police, and the terrorism in our cities, threaten our very way of life. Any politician who does not grasp this danger is not fit to lead our country. Americans watching this address tonight have seen the recent images of violence in our streets and the chaos in our communities. Many have witnessed this violence personally, some have even been its victims.\par \par \uc2 I have a message for all of you: the crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soon -- and I mean very soon -- come to an end. Beginning on January 20th, 2017, safety will be restored.\par \par \uc2 The most basic duty of government is to defend the lives of its own citizens. Any government that fails to do so is a government unworthy to lead.\par \par \uc2 It is finally time for a straightforward assessment of the state of our nation.\par \par \uc2 I will present the facts plainly and honestly.\par \par \uc2 We cannot afford to be so politically correct anymore.\par \par \uc2 So if you want to hear the corporate spin, the carefully crafted lies, and the media myths -- the Democrats are holding their convention next week. Go there.\par \par \uc2 But here, at our convention, there will be no lies. We will honor the American people with the truth, and nothing else.\par \par \uc2 These are the facts:\par \par \uc2 Decades of progress made in bringing down crime are now being reversed by this Administration's rollback of criminal enforcement. Homicides last year increased by 17% in America's fifty largest cities. That's the largest increase in 25 years. In our nation's capital, killings have risen by 50 percent. They are up nearly 60% in nearby Baltimore.\par \par \uc2 In the President's hometown of Chicago, more than 2,000 have been the victims of shootings this year alone. And more than 3,600 almost 4,000 have been killed in the Chicago area since he took office.\par \par \uc2 The number of police officers killed in the line of duty has risen by almost 50% compared to this point last year. Nearly 180,000 illegal immigrants with criminal records, ordered deported from our country, are tonight roaming free to threaten peaceful citizens.\par \par \uc2 The number of new \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  families who have crossed the border so far this year already exceeds the entire total from 2015. They are being released by the tens of thousands into our communities with no regard for the impact on public safety or resources. One such border-crosser was released and made his way to Nebraska. There, he ended the life of an innocent young girl named Sarah Root. She was 21-years-old, and was killed the day after graduating from college with a 4.0 Grade Point Average. Number one in her class. Her killer was then released a second time, and he is now a fugitive from the law.\par \par \uc2 I've met Sarah's beautiful family. But to this administration, their amazing daughter was just one more American life that wasn't worth protecting. No more. One more child to sacrifice on the altar of open borders.\par \par \uc2 What about our economy? Again, I will tell you the plain facts that have been edited out of\u160\'00\'A0your nightly news and your morning newspaper:\par \par \uc2 Nearly 4-in-10 African-American children are living in poverty, while 58 percent of African-American youth are now not employed. Two million more Latinos are in poverty today\u160\'00\'A0than when President \uc2 Obama\uc2  took his oath of office less than eight years ago. Another 14 million people have left the workforce entirely.\par \par \uc2 Household incomes are down more than $4,000 since the year 2000. Our trade deficit in goods -- think of this -- our trade deficit reached nearly $800 billion last year alone. We're going to fix that.\par \par \uc2 The budget is no better. President \uc2 Obama\uc2  has doubled our national debt to more than $19 trillion, and growing.\par \par \uc2 And yet, what do we have to show for it? Our roads and bridges are falling apart, our airports are Third World condition, and forty-three million Americans are on food stamps.\par \par \uc2 Now let us consider the state of affairs abroad. Not only have our citizens endured domestic disaster, but they have lived through one international humiliation after another. One after another. We all remember the images of our sailors being forced to their knees by their Iranian captors at gunpoint. This was just prior to the signing of the Iran deal, which gave back to Iran $150 billion and gave us absolutely nothing \u8212\'20\'14 it will go down in history as one of the worst deals ever made.\par \par \uc2 Another humiliation came when president \uc2 Obama\uc2  drew a red line in Syria \u8212\'20\'14 and the whole world knew it meant absolutely nothing. In Libya, our consulate \u8212\'20\'14 the symbol of American prestige around the globe \u8212\'20\'14 was brought down in flames.\par \par \uc2 America is far less safe \u8212\'20\'14 and the world is far less stable \u8212\'20\'14 than when \uc2 Obama\uc2  made the decision to put \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  in charge of America's foreign policy. Let's defeat her in November. I am certain it is a decision President \uc2 Obama\uc2  truly regrets.\par \par \uc2 Her bad instincts and her bad judgment \u8212\'20\'14 something pointed out by Bernie Sanders \u8212\'20\'14 are what caused so many of the disasters unfolding today. Let's review the record. In 2009, pre-Hillary, ISIS was not even on the map. Libya was cooperating stable. Egypt was peaceful. Iraq was seeing a big, big reduction in violence. Iran was being choked by sanctions.\u160\'00\'A0Syria was somewhat under control.\par \par \uc2 After four years of \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 , what do we have? ISIS has spread across the region, and the world. Libya is in ruins, and our Ambassador and his staff were left helpless to die at the hands of savage killers. Egypt was turned over to the radical Muslim brotherhood, forcing the military to retake control.\par \par \uc2 Iraq is in chaos. Iran is on the path to nuclear weapons. Syria is engulfed in a civil war and a refugee crisis that now threatens the West. After fifteen years of wars in the Middle East, after trillions of dollars spent and thousands of lives lost, the situation is worse than it has ever been before.\par \par \uc2 This is the legacy of \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 : death, destruction, terrorism and weakness. But \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 's legacy does not have to be America's legacy.\u160\'00\'A0The problems we face now \u8212\'20\'14 poverty and violence at home, war and destruction abroad \u8212\'20\'14 will last only as long as we continue relying on the same politicians who created them in the first place.\par \par \uc2 A change in leadership is required to get a change in outcomes. Tonight, I will share with you my plan of action for America.\par \par \uc2 The most important difference between our plan and that of our opponent, is that our plan will put America First. Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo.\u160\'00\'A0As long as we are led by politicians who will not put America First, then we can be assured that other nations will not treat America with respect -- the respect that we deserve.\par \par \uc2 This will all change in 2017. The American People will come first once again.\par \par \uc2 My plan will begin with safety at home \u8212\'20\'14 which means safe neighborhoods, secure borders, and protection from terrorism. There can be no prosperity without law and\u160\'00\'A0order. On the economy, I will outline reforms to add millions of new jobs and trillions in new wealth that can be used to rebuild America. A number of these reforms that I will outline tonight will be opposed by some of our nation's most powerful special interests.\par \par \uc2 That is because these interests have rigged our political and economic system for their exclusive benefit. Believe me, it's for their benefit. Big business, elite media and major donors\u160\'00\'A0are lining up behind the campaign of my opponent because they know she will keep our rigged system in place.\u160\'00\'A0They are throwing money at her because they have total control over everything she does.\par \par \uc2 She is their puppet, and they pull the strings. That is why \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 's message is that things will never change.\u160\'00\'A0Never, ever! My message is that things have to change \u8212\'20\'14 and they have to change right now. Every day I wake up determined to deliver for the people I have met all across this nation that have been ignored, neglected and abandoned.\par \par \uc2 I have visited the laid-off factory workers, and the communities crushed by our horrible and unfair trade deals. These are the forgotten men and women of our country. And they are forgotten, but they're not going to be forgotten long. People who work hard but no longer have a voice.\par \par \uc2 I AM YOUR VOICE.\par \par \uc2 I have embraced crying mothers who have lost their children because our politicians put their personal agendas before the national good.\par \par \uc2 (PROTESTER INTERRUPTS)\par \par \uc2 How great are our police? And how great is Cleveland?\par \par \uc2 I have no patience for injustice, no tolerance for government incompetence, no sympathy for leaders who fail their citizens. When innocent people suffer, because our political system lacks the will, or the courage, or the basic decency to enforce our laws \u8212\'20\'14 or worse still, has sold out to some corporate lobbyist for cash \u8212\'20\'14 I am not able to look the other way, and I won't look the other way.\par \par \uc2 And when a Secretary of State illegally stores her emails on a private server, deletes 33,000 of them so the authorities can't see her crime, puts our country at risk, lies about it in every different form and faces no consequence \u8212\'20\'14 I know that corruption has reached a level like never ever before in our country. When the FBI Director says that the Secretary of State was "extremely careless" and "negligent," in handling our classified secrets, I also know that these terms are minor compared to what she actually did. They were just used to save her from facing\u160\'00\'A0justice for her terrible crimes.\par \par \uc2 In fact, her single greatest accomplishment may be committing such an egregious crime and getting away with it \u8212\'20\'14 especially when others have paid so dearly. When that same Secretary of State rakes in millions of dollars trading access and favors to special interests and foreign powers I know the time for action has come. I have joined the political arena so that the powerful can no longer beat up on people that cannot defend themselves.\par \par \uc2 Nobody knows the system better than me, which is why I alone can fix it. I have seen firsthand how the system is rigged against our citizens, just like it was rigged against Bernie Sanders \u8212\'20\'14 he never had a chance. But his supporters will join our movement, because we will fix his biggest single issue: trade deals that strip our country of our jobs and strip us of our wealth as a country. Millions of Democrats will join our movement, because we are going to fix the system so it works justly for each and every American. In this cause, I am proud to have at my side the next Vice President of the United States: Governor \uc2 Mike Pence\uc2  of Indiana. And a great guy. We will bring the same economic success to America that Mike brought to Indiana. He is a man of character and accomplishment. He is the right man for the job.\par \par \uc2 The first task for our new Administration will be to liberate our citizens from the crime and terrorism and lawlessness that threatens their communities. America was shocked to its core when our police officers in Dallas were brutally executed. In the days after Dallas, we have seen continued threats and violence against our law enforcement officials. Law officers have been shot or killed in recent days in Georgia, Missouri, Wisconsin, Kansas, Michigan and Tennessee. On Sunday, more police were gunned down in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Three were killed, and four were badly injured.\par \par \uc2 An attack on law enforcement is an attack on all Americans.\par \par \uc2 I have a message to every last person threatening the peace on our streets and the safety of our police: When I take the oath of office next year, I will restore law and order to our country. Believe me. Believe me.\par \par \uc2 I will work with, and appoint, the best prosecutors and law enforcement officials in the country to get the job properly done. In this race for the White House, I am the law And order candidate.\par \par \uc2 The irresponsible rhetoric of our President, who has used the pulpit of the presidency to divide us by race and color, has made America a more dangerous environment for everyone than frankly I have ever seen and anybody in this room has ever watched or seen. This Administration has failed America's inner cities. Remember: it has failed America's inner cities.\par \par \uc2 It's failed them on education. It's failed them on jobs. It's failed them on crime. It's failed them on every single level. When I am President, I will work to ensure that all of our kids are treated equally, and protected equally. Every action I take, I will ask myself: does this make life better for young Americans in Baltimore, in Chicago, in Detroit, in Ferguson who have as much of a right to live out their dreams as any other child in America? Any other child.\par \par \uc2 To make life safe in America, we must also address the growing threats we face from outside America: We are going to defeat the barbarians of ISIS. And we're going to defeat them fast.\par \par \uc2 Once again, France is the victim of brutal Islamic terrorism. Men, women and children viciously mowed down. Lives ruined. Families ripped apart. A nation in mourning. The damage and devastation that can be inflicted by Islamic radicals has been proven over and over \u8212\'20\'14 at the World Trade Center, at an office party in San Bernardino, at the Boston Marathon, and a military recruiting center in Chattanooga, Tennessee. And many, many other locations.\par \par \uc2 Only weeks ago, in Orlando, Florida, 49 wonderful Americans were savagely murdered by an Islamic terrorist. This time, the terrorist targeted our LGBTQ community. No good. And we're going to stop it. As your President, I will do everything in my power to protect our LGBTQ citizens from the violence and oppression of a hateful foreign ideology.\par \par \uc2 I must say as a Republican it is so nice to hear you cheering for what I just said. Thank you.\par \par \uc2 To protect us from terrorism, we need to focus on three things. We must have the best intelligence- gathering operation in the world. We must abandon the failed policy of nation- building and regime change that \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  pushed in Iraq, Libya, Egypt and Syria.\par \par \uc2 Instead, we must work with all of our allies who share our goal of destroying ISIS and stamping out Islamic terrorism and doing it now, doing it quickly. We're going to win. We're going to win fast. This includes working with our greatest ally in the region, the State of Israel.\par \par \uc2 Recently I have said that \uc2 NATO\uc2  was obsolete, because it did not properly cover terror, and also, that many of the member countries were not paying their fair share. As usual, the United States has been picking up the cost. Shortly thereafter, it was announced that \uc2 NATO\uc2  will be setting up a new program in order to combat terrorism -- a true step in the right direction.\par \par \uc2 Lastly, and very importantly we must immediately suspend immigration from any nation that has been compromised by terrorism until such time as proven vetting mechanisms have been put in place. We don't want them in our country.\par \par \uc2 My opponent has called for a radical 550% increase in Syrian -- Think of this. Think of this. This is not believable, but this is what's happening -- refugees on top of existing massive refugee flows coming into our country under President \uc2 Obama\uc2 . She proposes this despite the fact that there's no way to screen these refugees in order to find out who they are or where they come from.\par \par \uc2 I only want to admit individuals into our country who will support our values and love our people. Anyone who endorses violence, hatred or oppression is not welcome in our country and never will be. Decades of record immigration have produced lower wages and higher unemployment for our citizens, especially for African-American and Latino workers. We are going to have an immigration system that works, but one that works for the American people.\par \par \uc2 On Monday, we heard from three parents whose children were killed by illegal immigrants Mary Ann Mendoza, Sabine Durden, and my friend Jamiel Shaw.\par \par \uc2 They are just three brave representatives of many thousands. Of all my travels in this country, nothing has affected me more deeply than the time I have spent with the mothers and fathers who have lost their children to violence spilling across our border, which we can solve. We have to solve it. These families have no special interests to represent them. There are no demonstrators to protest on their behalf.\par \par \uc2 My opponent will never meet with them, or share in their pain. Instead, my opponent wants Sanctuary Cities. But where was sanctuary for Kate Steinle? Where was sanctuary for the children of Mary Ann and Sabine and Jamiel? Where was sanctuary for all the other -- oh, it is so sad to even be talking about it because we can fix this problem so quickly -- Americans who have been so brutally murdered, and who have suffered so horribly?\par \par \uc2 These wounded American families have been alone. But they are not alone any longer. Tonight, this candidate and this whole nation stand in their corner to support them, to send them our love, and to pledge in their honor that we will save countless more families from suffering and the same awful fate. We are going to build a great border wall to stop illegal immigration, to stop the gangs and the violence, and to stop the drugs from pouring into our communities.\par \par \uc2 I have been honored to receive the endorsement of America's Border Patrol Agents, and will work directly with them to protect the integrity of our lawful, lawful, lawful immigration system. Lawful. By ending catch-and-release on the border, we will stop the cycle of human smuggling and violence. Illegal border crossings will go down. We will stop it. It won't be happening very much anymore. Believe me. Peace will be restored. By enforcing the rules for the millions who overstay their visas, our laws will finally receive the respect they deserve.\par \par \uc2 Tonight, I want every American whose demands for immigration security have been denied \u8212\'20\'14 and every politician who has denied them \u8212\'20\'14 to listen very closely to the words I am about to say. On January 21st of 2017, the day after I take the oath of office, On January 20th of 2017, the day I take the oath of office, Americans will finally wake up in a country where the laws of the United States are enforced.\par \par \uc2 We are going to be considerate and compassionate to everyone. But my greatest compassion will be for our own struggling citizens.\par \par \uc2 USA! USA!\par \par \uc2 My plan is the exact opposite of the radical and dangerous immigration policy of \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 . Americans want relief from uncontrolled immigration. Communities want relief. Yet \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  is proposing mass amnesty, mass immigration, and mass lawlessness. Her plan will overwhelm your schools and hospitals, further reduce your jobs and wages, and make it harder for recent immigrants to escape the tremendous cycle of poverty that they're going through right now and make it almost impossible to join the middle class. I have a different vision for our workers. It begins with a new, fair trade policy that protects our jobs and stands up to countries that cheat of which there are many.\par \par \uc2 It's been a signature message of my campaign from day one, and it will be a signature feature of my presidency from the moment I take the oath of office.\par \par \uc2 I have made billions of dollars in business making deals \u8212\'20\'14 now I'm going to make our country rich again. Using the richest people in the world, which our country has, I am going to turn our bad trade agreements into great trade agreements. America has lost nearly-one third of its manufacturing jobs since 1997, following the enactment of disastrous trade deals supported\u160\'00\'A0by Bill and \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 . Remember, it was \uc2 Bill Clinton\uc2  who signed \uc2 NAFTA\uc2 , one of the worst economic deals ever made by our country -- or, frankly, any other country. Never again. I am going to bring our jobs back to Ohio and Pennsylvania and New York and Michigan and all of America \u8212\'20\'14 and I am not going to let companies move to other countries, firing their employees along the way, without consequences. Not going to happen anymore.\par \par \uc2 My opponent, on the other hand, has supported virtually every trade agreement that has been destroying our middle class. She supported \uc2 NAFTA\uc2 , and she supported China's entrance into the \uc2 World Trade Organization\uc2  \u8212\'20\'14 another one of her husband's colossal mistakes and disasters. She supported the job- killing trade deal with South Korea. She has supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The TPP will not only destroy our manufacturing, but it will make America subject\u160\'00\'A0to the rulings of foreign governments and it's not going to happen.\par \par \uc2 I pledge to never sign any trade agreement that hurts our workers, or that diminishes our freedom and independence. I will never, ever sign bad trade deals. America fist, again! America first! Instead, I will make individual deals with individual countries. No longer will we enter into these massive transactions, with many countries, that are thousands of pages long \u8212\'20\'14 and which no one from our country even reads or understands.\par \par \uc2 We are going to enforce all trade violations, including through the use of taxes and tariffs, against any country that cheats. This includes stopping China's outrageous theft of intellectual property, along with their illegal product dumping, and their devastating currency manipulation. They are the greatest that ever came about; they are the greatest currency manipulators ever! Our horrible trade agreements with China and many others, will be totally renegotiated. That includes renegotiating \uc2 NAFTA\uc2  to get a much better deal for America \u8212\'20\'14 and we'll walk\u160\'00\'A0away if we don't get that kind of a deal.\par \par \uc2 We are going to start building and making things again. Next comes the reform of our tax laws, regulations and energy rules. While \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  plans a massive -- and I mean massive -- tax increase, I have proposed the largest tax reduction of any candidate who has declared for the presidential race this year \u8212\'20\'14 Democrat or Republican.\par \par \uc2 Middle-income Americans will experience\u160\'00\'A0profound relief, and taxes will be simplified for everyone, and I mean everyone. America is one of the highest-taxed nations in the world. Reducing taxes will cause new companies and new jobs to come roaring back into our country. Believe me, it will happen, and it will happen fast. Then we are going to deal with the issue of regulation, one of the greatest job-killers of them all. Excessive regulation is costing our country as much as $2 trillion a year, and we will end it very, very quickly. We are going to lift the restrictions on the\u160\'00\'A0production of American energy.\par \par \uc2 This will produce more than $20 trillion in job-creating economic activity over the next four decades. My opponent, on the other hand, wants to put the great miners and steel workers of our country out of work and out of business \u8212\'20\'14 that will never happen with \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  as president. Our steelworkers and our miners are going back to work again. With these new economic policies, trillions of dollars will start flowing into our country. This new wealth will improve the quality of life for all Americans \u8212\'20\'14 We will build the roads, highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, and the railways of tomorrow. This, in turn, will create millions more jobs. We will rescue kids from failing schools by helping their parents send them to a safe school of their choice. My opponent would rather protect educational bureaucrats than serve American children. And that's what she's doing, and that's what she's done.\par \par \uc2 We will repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare. You will be able to choose your own doctor again. And we will fix TSA at the airports which is a total disaster!\par \par \uc2 Thank you. Thank you.\par \par \uc2 We are going to work with all of our students who are drowning in debt to take the pressure off these young people just starting out their adult lives.\par \par \uc2 We will completely rebuild our depleted military, and the countries that we protect, at a massive loss, will be asked to pay their fair share. We will take care of our great veterans like they have never been taken care of before. My just-released Ten Point Plan has received tremendous veteran support. We will guarantee those who serve this country will be able to visit the doctor or hospital of their choice without waiting five days in line and dying.\par \par \uc2 My opponent dismissed the VA scandal as being not widespread \u8212\'20\'14 one more sign of how out of touch she really is. We are going to ask every Department Head in government to provide a list of wasteful spending projects that we can eliminate in my first 100 days. The politicians have talked about it, I'm going to do it.\par \par \uc2 We are also going to appoint justices to the \uc2 United States Supreme Court\uc2  who will uphold our laws and our Constitution. The replacement for our beloved Justice Scalia will be a person of similar views and judicial philosophies. Very important. This will be one of the most important issues decided by this election. My opponent wants to essentially abolish the 2nd amendment. I, on the other hand, received the early and strong endorsement of the \uc2 National Rifle Association\uc2  and will protect the right of all Americans to keep their families safe.\par \par \uc2 At this moment, I would like to thank the evangelical and religious community because I'll tell you what, the support they have given me, and I'm not sure I totally deserve it has been so amazing and has had such a big reason for me being here tonight. So true. They have so much to contribute to our politics, yet our laws prevent you from speaking your minds from your own pulpits. An amendment, pushed by Lyndon Johnson, many years ago, threatens religious institutions with a loss of their tax-exempt status if they openly advocate their political views. Their voice has been taken away.\par \par \uc2 I am going to work very hard to repeal that language and protect free speech for all Americans. We can accomplish these great things, and so much more \u8212\'20\'14 all we need to do is start believing in ourselves and in our country again. Start believing. It is time to show the whole world that America is back \u8212\'20\'14 bigger, and better and stronger than ever before.\par \par \uc2 In this journey, I'm so lucky to have at my side my wife Melania and my wonderful children, Don, Ivanka, Eric, Tiffany, and Barron: you will always be my greatest source of pride and joy. And by the way, Melania and Ivanka -- did they do a job?\par \par \uc2 My Dad, Fred Trump, was the smartest and hardest working man I ever knew. I wonder sometimes what he'd say if he were here to see this and to see me tonight. It's because of him that I learned, from my youngest age, to respect the dignity of work and the dignity of working people. He was a guy most comfortable in the company of bricklayers and carpenters, and electricians and I have a lot of that in me also. I love those people.\par \par \uc2 Then there's my mother, Mary. She was strong, but also warm and fair-minded. She was a truly great mother. She was also one of the most honest and charitable people I have ever known, and a great, great judge of character. She could pick 'em out from anywhere. To my sisters Mary Anne and Elizabeth, my brother Robert and my late brother Fred, I will always give you my love. You are most special to me.\par \par \uc2 I have had a truly great life in business. But now, my sole and exclusive mission is to go to work for our country \u8212\'20\'14 to go to work for you. It's time to deliver a victory for the American people. We don't win anymore, but we are going to start winning again. But to do that, we must break free from the petty politics of the past. America is a nation of believers, dreamers, and strivers that is being led by a group of censors, critics, and cynics.\par \par \uc2 Remember: All of the people telling you that you can't have the country you want, are the same people that wouldn't stand -- I mean, they said Trump doesn't have a chance of being here tonight. Not a chance! The same people. Oh, we love defeating those people, don't we? Love it, love it, love it. No longer can we rely on those same people in politics and in the media, who will say anything to keep a rigged system in place. Instead, we must choose to Believe In America.\par \par \uc2 History is watching us now. It's waiting to see if we will rise to the occasion, and if we will show the whole world that America is still free and independent and strong. I'm asking for your support tonight so that I can be your champion in the White House.\par \par \uc2 My opponent asks her supporters to recite a three-word loyalty pledge. It reads: "I'm With Her". I choose to recite a different pledge.\par \par \uc2 My pledge reads: "I'M WITH YOU \u8212\'20\'14 THE AMERICAN PEOPLE."\par \par \uc2 I am your voice.\par \par \uc2 So to every parent who dreams for their child, and every child who dreams for their future, I say these words to you tonight: I'm With You, and I will fight for you, and I will win for you.\par \par \uc2 To all Americans tonight, in all our cities and towns, I make this promise:\par \par \uc2 We Will Make America Strong Again.\par \par \uc2 We Will Make America Proud Again.\par \par \uc2 We Will Make America Safe Again.\par \par \uc2 And we Will Make America Great Again!\par \par \uc2 God bless you, and good night! I love you!\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020160721ec7l008eu\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved \par \par \uc2 The dark portrait of America that \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  sketched in his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention is a compendium of doomsday stats that fall apart upon close scrutiny. Numbers are taken out of context, data is manipulated, and sometimes the facts are wrong.\par \par \uc2 When facts are inconveniently positive - such as rising incomes and an unemployment rate under 5 percent - Trump simply declines to mention them. He describes an exceedingly violent nation, flooded with murders, when in reality, the violent-crime rate has been cut in half since the crack cocaine epidemic hit its peak in 1991.\par \par \uc2 In his speech, Trump promised to present "the plain facts that have been edited out of your nightly news and your morning newspaper." But he relies on statistics that are ripe for manipulation, citing misleading numbers on the economy, for example, through selective use of years, data and sources.\par \par \uc2 Here is a rundown of some of Trump's key claims - and how they differ from reality - arranged by subject.\par \par \uc2 Crime\par \par \uc2 "The number of police officers killed in the line of duty has risen by almost 50 percent, compared to this point last year."\par \par \uc2 This is wrong. The number of law enforcement officers killed on the job has increased 8 percent, compared to this point in 2015.\par \par \uc2 Moreover, the overall number of police deaths has decreased in the past two decades. For the past 10 to 15 years, traffic-related incidents (including pursuits and instances in which officers are intentionally struck) have been the leading cause of death among police officers.\par \par \uc2 "Homicides last year increased by 17 percent in America's 50 largest cities. That's the largest increase in 25 years. In our nation's capital, killings have risen by 50 percent. They are up nearly 60 percent in nearby Baltimore."\par \par \uc2 Trump cherry-picks data to paint an alarming picture of homicide trends, when in reality, the homicide rate has been declining for decades.\par \par \uc2 In 2015, there was an uptick in homicides in 36 of the nation's 50 largest cities. The rate did, indeed, increase nearly 17 percent over 2014, and it was the worst annual change since 1990. The homicide rate was up 54.3 percent in Washington, and 58.5 percent in Baltimore.\par \par \uc2 But the percentage increase was large because the number of homicides in 2014 was relatively small. Meanwhile, homicide trends have been split in the major cities so far this year: Out of 63 agencies reporting to the Major Cities Chiefs Association, 32 cities saw a decrease in homicides in the first quarter of 2016, and 31 cities saw an increase.\par \par \uc2 Immigration\par \par \uc2 "Nearly 180,000 illegal immigrants with criminal records, ordered deported from our country, are tonight roaming free to threaten peaceful citizens."\par \par \uc2 This number sounds much worse than it really is. In fiscal 2015, \uc2 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2  deported nearly 140,000 convicted criminals, but ICE has estimated that nearly 1 million noncitizens with final deportation orders remain in the United States.\par \par \uc2 Of those, 182,786 have been convicted of crimes, and about 6,000 have been detained.\par \par \uc2 The actual crimes committed by this group are not documented, however, so Trump cannot easily claim that all of these illegal immigrants "threaten peaceful citizens." A significant percentage of their crimes involve immigration violations and nonviolent offenses, according to historical records.\par \par \uc2 "The number of new \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  families who have crossed the border so far this year already exceeds the entire total from 2015. They are being released by the tens of thousands into our communities with no regard for the impact on public safety or resources."\par \par \uc2 This is another cherry-picked number. From October to June, just over 50,000 families were apprehended at the southwestern border, up from about 40,000 in all of the previous fiscal year, according to \uc2 U.S. Customs and Border Protection\uc2 . But overall apprehensions, including of unaccompanied minors, are running only slightly higher than in 2015 and remain far less than in 2014, 2013 and 2012.\par \par \uc2 Many of the Central American families arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border are being allowed into the country pending review of their cases in immigration court. If they are being released, it is typically because they have requested asylum because they are fleeing extreme violence, instability and endemic poverty in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras.\par \par \uc2 "Decades of record immigration have produced lower wages and higher unemployment for our citizens, especially for African American and Latino workers."\par \par \uc2 This claim is quite convoluted.\par \par \uc2 First, Trump makes no distinction between legal and illegal immigration. The flow of legal immigrants has increased over the past four decades, stabilizing at roughly 1 million people obtaining lawful permanent resident status every year since 2001.\par \par \uc2 The unauthorized immigrant population increased from about 4 million in 1990 to about 12 million in 2007. But researchers estimate that the number of illegal immigrants has been essentially stable since then because of the large number of unauthorized immigrants who left the country during and after the Great Recession.\par \par \uc2 In general, economists have found that immigration benefits the U.S. economy and most workers. The slight negative effects are felt most strongly by less-educated and low-skilled workers.\par \par \uc2 Economy\par \par \uc2 "2 million more Latinos are in poverty today than when the president took his oath of office."\par \par \uc2 Trump is being misleading here, turning a good news story into something negative.\par \par \uc2 From March 2009 to March 2014, the most recent year for which statistics are available, the number of Latinos in poverty increased by 750,000 people, according to the \uc2 U.S. Census Bureau\uc2 . But the overall number of the Latinos grew by nearly 7 million. So the percent of Latinos living in poverty declined from 25.3 percent to 23.6 percent.\par \par \uc2 "Household incomes are down more than $4,000 since the year 2000 - 16 years ago."\par \par \uc2 This is a stale statistic, based on 2014 Census data, which ignores the fact that incomes have risen sharply in the past two years.\par \par \uc2 A more up-to-date figure comes from the nonpartisan economic consulting firm Sentier Research, which produces a monthly report using data from the Census Bureau's monthly household survey.\par \par \uc2 The most recent report, released Thursday, hours before Trump's speech, shows median annual household income was $57,206 in June, down slightly from January 2000, when it was $57,826 in 2016 dollars. So household income is essentially flat, not down $4,000.\par \par \uc2 "Forty-three million Americans are on food stamps."\par \par \uc2 Trump's point is that America's economy has suffered under the Obama administration. But he fails to mention that this is the lowest number of people receiving food stamps since the program reached its peak in 2013, a sign that the economy is finally improving enough to help the desperately poor families who depend on it.\par \par \uc2 "Fifty-eight percent of African American youth are not employed."\par \par \uc2 The official unemployment rate for black youth is about half of what Trump says it is.\par \par \uc2 According to the \uc2 U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics\uc2 , the unemployment rate among blacks 16 to 19 years old was 31.2 percent in June. This official unemployment rate refers to people who are actively looking for work, as a percentage of the total available workforce.\par \par \uc2 "Another 14 million people have left the workforce entirely."\par \par \uc2 This is yet another misleading figure. The number of people who have left the workforce has certainly increased since 2009, though this is usually expressed as a decline in the labor participation rate, which is the portion of people older than 16 who are employed or actively seeking employment. The labor participation rate has dropped under Obama, from 65.7 percent in 2009 to 62.7 percent.\par \par \uc2 However, experts say about half of the decline in the labor participation rate since 1999 is due to the retirement of the baby boomers. Economists estimate just 15 percent of the drop in the labor force involves people who want a job and are of prime working age (25 to 54).\par \par \uc2 "America has lost nearly one-third of its manufacturing jobs since 1997, following the enactment of disastrous trade deals supported by Bill and \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 ."\par \par \uc2 Trump picks a high point for manufacturing jobs, in Clinton's second term. He also ignores the fact that the economy has added nearly 1 million manufacturing jobs since 2010, the low point after the Great Recession.\par \par \uc2 It is simplistic to pin blame for the decline in manufacturing jobs on trade agreements. Increased efficiency and technological advancement have also played a major role.\par \par \uc2 glenn.kessler@washpost.com \par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com\par \par \uc2 WP20160722factchecker0722\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020160722ec7m00036\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 A-Section\par {\*\bkmkstart toc55}{\*\bkmkend toc55}\b \uc2 Trump's gloomy vision is far from 'Morning in America'\b0\par\par\uc2 Jenna Johnson \par \uc2 1,623 \uc2 words\par \uc2 22 July 2016\par \uc2 The Washington Post\par \uc2 WP\par \uc2 FINAL\par A07\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved \par \par \uc2 CLEVELAND - The Republican presidential convention this week has highlighted \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 's view of America - and it sounds like a terrible, terrible place.\par \par \uc2 In Trump's eyes, the United States is practically a Third World country, with crumbling roads, aging bridges and decrepit airports. It's led by "stupid people" - even Mexico has smarter leaders, he says - and the entire world is laughing at America and its "depleted military." Cities have "exploded" with violence; Islamic State fighters posing as refugees might attack at any moment; and the economy is "doing lousy," with a real unemployment rate that could be eight times as high as the official one.\par \par \uc2 Trump even compared the health of the nation to a friend who is dying of cancer and is barely holding on.\par \par \uc2 "If we don't get tough, and if we don't get smart, and fast, we're not going to have our country anymore," Trump said in a recent policy speech. "There will be nothing, absolutely nothing, left."\par \par \uc2 Trump promises that if he becomes president, all of these problems will dissolve and he will fulfill his "Make America Great Again" slogan. But his current assessment of the state of the union is one of the most dismal and depressing messages ever pushed by a major-party nominee, and it has been amplified by a long line of convention speakers this week.\par \par \uc2 "The world has lost confidence in us. The inevitable consequence: weakness, decline, and, ultimately, chaos and oblivion," South Carolina Lt. Gov. Henry McMaster said on Tuesday night. "We feel an eerie unease."\par \par \uc2 The overwhelmingly gloomy tone stands in stark contrast to previous conventions that struck a much more celebratory note, with nominees sharing their sunny vision for the future. Rather than Ronald Reagan's "Morning in America," Trump talks of a dark and long night.\par \par \uc2 Trump continued to deliver his heavy message on Thursday night as he accused President Obama of a "rollback of criminal enforcement," resulting in a burst of murders in several major cities. Trump said in his prepared remarks that "\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  families" are "being released by the tens of thousands into our communities with no regard for the impact on public safety or resources." Abroad, Trump said Americans have "lived through one international embarrassment after another."\par \par \uc2 "This will all change in 2017," said Trump, who spent more time detailing the country's problems than his proposed solutions, according to his prepared remarks.\par \par \uc2 Staying negative could turn off many general-election voters, and it risks clashing with their personal experience, because life has improved for many Americans in recent years.\par \par \uc2 Last month, the unemployment rate stood at 4.9 percent - lower than the seven-decade average of 5.8 percent and less than half of the 10 percent jobless rate that marked the peak of the Great Recession in October 2009. Although wages have largely remained stagnant, the Labor Department and wage analysts have noted a recent uptick in employee pay that, although small, represents the biggest such increase in years. Meanwhile, consumer confidence has rebounded to above-average levels after plummeting to all-time lows in 2008 and early 2009, according to the Conference Board and the Michigan Survey of Consumers.\par \par \uc2 Violent crime rates also have fallen significantly since the 1990s, despite recent spikes in the number of homicides in several major cities. The Islamic State has been severely weakened and has lost more than half of the land it once controlled in Iraq and Syria; many intelligence experts say the recent attacks inspired by the group in California, Orlando and southern France are a sign of desperation rather than strength.\par \par \uc2 Democrat \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  has presented a much more positive view of the country, saying that America is already great. A few fellow Republicans have also gently pushed Trump to deliver a more hopeful vision.\par \par \uc2 "Our party has to be in the long term - and in the medium and the short term - a unifying, a lifting and a hopeful party," Ohio Gov. John Kasich told members of Michigan's GOP convention delegation over breakfast Tuesday. "That party that can enunciate the hopes and dreams and the unity is the party that's going to do well."\par \par \uc2 Trump has said the November election will give voters two options: more of the same with Clinton or something completely different with him.\par \par \uc2 According to a Washington Post-ABC News poll this month, 28 percent of those surveyed said they thought the country was going in the right direction, while 68 percent said it was on the wrong track. While decidedly negative, optimism is slightly higher than when Obama was elected during the recession in 2008: Then, 19 percent of those polled said the country was headed in the right direction.\par \par \uc2 Still, many American families continue to feel financially insecure. A Washington Post-ABC News poll in March found that a third of working, middle- and upper-middle class Americans said they struggle to maintain their current standard of living. Republican voters who said they were struggling financially were more likely to support Trump's nomination than those who said they were living comfortably or felt as if they were moving up in life, according to the poll.\par \par \uc2 Ben S. Bernanke, a former chairman of the Federal Reserve, recently wrote that although measures of personal financial security have largely returned to pre-recession levels, many people continue to hold stubbornly negative views about the economy and diminished expectations for the future.\par \par \uc2 "Without doubt, the economic problems facing the country are real, and require serious and sustained responses," Bernanke said in a June 30 blog post. "But while perceptions of economic stress are certainly roiling our national politics, it may also be that our roiled politics are worsening how we collectively perceive the economy."\par \par \uc2 This division falls along party lines: Nearly 6 in 10 Democrats in a recent CNN/ORC poll rated the national economy as at least "somewhat good," compared with about 4 in 10 independents and fewer than 3 in 10 Republicans.\par \par \uc2 Unease about the future is not just about economic stability. Many Trump supporters also worry that the country is no longer safe, especially following a series of terrorist attacks and the recent killings of police officers in Dallas and Baton Rouge. Polling has shown growing distrust in politicians, government and the media.\par \par \uc2 In Cleveland, convention speakers have stoked those fears. The theme on the first day was "Make America Safe Again," and speakers included a father whose teenage son was murdered by a gang member living in the country illegally, a mother who blamed her son's death in Libya on Clinton, and a \uc2 U.S. Marine Corps\uc2  veteran who graphically described the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya.\par \par \uc2 "We cannot continue down this path," retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, whom Trump considered as his running mate, told an ever-dwindling crowd late Monday night. "More lives are at stake. Our way of life is in jeopardy. Our very existence is threatened."\par \par \uc2 Themes of terrorism and crime came up again Tuesday, when the convention was supposed to focus on making "America Work Again." Most speakers instead listed reasons why Clinton should not be president or should be prosecuted.\par \par \uc2 "We live in dangerous times," said \uc2 Chris W. Cox\uc2 , executive director of the National Rifle Association's Institute for Legislative Action. "We're worried, and we have reason to be."\par \par \uc2 During the primary campaign, Trump often started his rallies by reading depressing statistics about the economy of the town or state he was visiting, sometimes to the annoyance of local Republican leaders who have worked hard to boost their local economies. Republican governors have been especially sensitive to Trump's critiques.\par \par \uc2 At a rally in early May in South Bend, Ind., Trump said that the national unemployment rate is "20 percent or more" and that the official unemployment rate was created "to make politicians look good." Trump promised to stop the local air-conditioner factory from moving to Mexico, along with other improbable vows.\par \par \uc2 "Don't be depressed," Trump said, "because we're going to fix it."\par \par \uc2 Last week, Trump selected Indiana Gov. Mike Pence as his running mate and said that his primary reason for doing so was Indiana's booming economy, job creation and low unemployment rate.\par \par \uc2 At the convention Tuesday night, Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), who has closely advised Trump for months, sounded Trumpian in his description of the country.\par \par \uc2 "Our political system is not working. We operate like the trench warfare battles of World War I, where hundreds of thousands die but no ground is gained," Sessions said. "Median incomes have declined. Terrorist attacks are increasing. Respect for America has fallen. Crime is rising, and the president, he blames the police."\par \par \uc2 The theme Wednesday was "Make America First Again," but the topics and tone did not adjust accordingly. On stage, former House speaker \uc2 Newt Gingrich\uc2  (Ga.) said that the United States is losing the war on terrorism; that the threat to the nation was "worse than September 11" of 2001; and that electing Clinton could lead to a terrorist nuclear attack on a U.S. city.\par \par \uc2 Trump's campaign chairman, \uc2 Paul Manafort\uc2 , insisted that the tone this week has not been a downer. Instead, he said he senses a joyous vibe.\par \par \uc2 "There is an anger among the delegates that is out there in America," Manafort told reporters. "People are feeling frustrated by the failed leadership, by the difficult economic times and by their fear of living in their communities.

\par\par \uc2 National-Politics\par {\*\bkmkstart toc56}{\*\bkmkend toc56}\b \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 's vision of doom and despair in America\b0\par\par\uc2 By Jenna Johnson \par \uc2 1,621 \uc2 words\par \uc2 22 July 2016\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 CLEVELAND \u8212\'20\'14 The Republican presidential convention this week has highlighted \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 's view of America \u8212\'20\'14 and it sounds like a terrible, terrible place.\par \par \uc2 In Trump's eyes, the United States is practically a Third World country, with crumbling roads, aging bridges and decrepit airports. It's led by "stupid people" \u8212\'20\'14 even Mexico has smarter leaders, he says \u8212\'20\'14 and the entire world is laughing at America and its "depleted military." Cities have "exploded" with violence; Islamic State fighters posing as refugees might attack at any moment; and the economy is "doing lousy," with a real unemployment rate that could be eight times as high as the official one.\par \par \uc2 Trump even compared the health of the nation to a friend who is dying of cancer and is barely holding on.\par \par \uc2 "If we don't get tough, and if we don't get smart, and fast, we're not going to have our country anymore," Trump said in a recent policy speech. "There will be nothing, absolutely nothing, left."\par \par \uc2 Trump promises that if he becomes president, all of these problems will dissolve and he will fulfill his "Make America Great Again" slogan. But his current assessment of the state of the union is one of the most dismal and depressing messages ever pushed by a major-party nominee, and it has been amplified by a long line of convention speakers this week.\par \par \uc2 "The world has lost confidence in us. The inevitable consequence: weakness, decline, and, ultimately, chaos and oblivion," South Carolina Lt. Gov. Henry McMaster said on Tuesday night. "We feel an eerie unease."\par \par \uc2 The overwhelmingly gloomy tone stands in stark contrast to previous conventions that struck a much more celebratory note, with nominees sharing their sunny vision for the future. Rather than Ronald Reagan's "Morning in America," Trump talks of a dark and long night.\par \par \uc2 Trump continued to deliver his heavy message on Thursday night as he accused President Obama of a "rollback of criminal enforcement," resulting in a burst of murders in several major cities. Trump said in his prepared remarks that "\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  families" are "being released by the tens of thousands into our communities with no regard for the impact on public safety or resources." Abroad, Trump said Americans have "lived through one international embarrassment after another."\par \par \uc2 "This will all change in 2017," said Trump, who spent more time detailing the country's problems than his proposed solutions, according to his prepared remarks.\par \par \uc2 Staying negative could turn off many general-election voters, and it risks clashing with their personal experience, because life has improved for many Americans in recent years.\par \par \uc2 Last month, the unemployment rate stood at 4.9 percent \u8212\'20\'14 lower than the seven-decade average of 5.8 percent and less than half of the 10 percent jobless rate that marked the peak of the Great Recession in October 2009. Although wages have largely remained stagnant, the Labor Department and wage analysts have noted a recent uptick in employee pay that, although small, represents the biggest such increase in years. Meanwhile, consumer confidence has rebounded to above-average levels after plummeting to all-time lows in 2008 and early 2009, according to the Conference Board and the Michigan Survey of Consumers.\par \par \uc2 Violent crime rates also have fallen significantly since the 1990s, despite recent spikes in the number of homicides in several major cities. The Islamic State has been severely weakened and has lost more than half of the land it once controlled in Iraq and Syria; many intelligence experts say the recent attacks inspired by the group in California, Orlando and southern France are a sign of desperation rather than strength.\par \par \uc2 Democrat \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  has presented a much more positive view of the country, saying that America is already great. A few fellow Republicans have also gently pushed Trump to deliver a more hopeful vision.\par \par \uc2 "Our party has to be in the long term \u8212\'20\'14 and in the medium and the short term \u8212\'20\'14 a unifying, a lifting and a hopeful party," Ohio Gov. John Kasich told members of Michigan's GOP convention delegation over breakfast Tuesday. "That party that can enunciate the hopes and dreams and the unity is the party that's going to do well."\par \par \uc2 Trump has said the November election will give voters two options: more of the same with Clinton or something completely different with him.\par \par \uc2 According to a Washington Post-ABC News poll this month, 28 percent of those surveyed said they thought the country was going in the right direction, while 68 percent said it was on the wrong track. While decidedly negative, optimism is slightly higher than when Obama was elected during the recession in 2008: Then, 19 percent of those polled said the country was headed in the right direction.\par \par \uc2 Still, many American families continue to feel financially insecure. A Washington Post-ABC News poll in March found that a third of working, middle- and upper-middle class Americans said they struggle to maintain their current standard of living. Republican voters who said they were struggling financially were more likely to support Trump's nomination than those who said they were living comfortably or felt as if they were moving up in life, according to the poll.\par \par \uc2 Ben S. Bernanke, a former chairman of the Federal Reserve, recently wrote that although measures of personal financial security have largely returned to pre-recession levels, many people continue to hold stubbornly negative views about the economy and diminished expectations for the future.\par \par \uc2 "Without doubt, the economic problems facing the country are real, and require serious and sustained responses," Bernanke said in a June 30 blog post. "But while perceptions of economic stress are certainly roiling our national politics, it may also be that our roiled politics are worsening how we collectively perceive the economy."\par \par \uc2 This division falls along party lines: Nearly 6 in 10 Democrats in a recent CNN/ORC poll rated the national economy as at least "somewhat good," compared with about 4 in 10 independents and fewer than 3 in 10 Republicans.\par \par \uc2 Unease about the future is not just about economic stability. Many Trump supporters also worry that the country is no longer safe, especially following a series of terrorist attacks and the recent killings of police officers in Dallas and Baton Rouge. Polling has shown growing distrust in politicians, government and the media.\par \par \uc2 In Cleveland, convention speakers have stoked those fears. The theme on the first day was "Make America Safe Again," and speakers included a father whose teenage son was murdered by a gang member living in the country illegally, a mother who blamed her son's death in Libya on Clinton, and a \uc2 U.S. Marine Corps\uc2  veteran who graphically described the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya.\par \par \uc2 "We cannot continue down this path," retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, whom Trump considered as his running mate, told an ever-dwindling crowd late Monday night. "More lives are at stake. Our way of life is in jeopardy. Our very existence is threatened."\par \par \uc2 Themes of terrorism and crime came up again Tuesday, when the convention was supposed to focus on making "America Work Again." Most speakers instead listed reasons why Clinton should not be president or should be prosecuted.\par \par \uc2 "We live in dangerous times," said \uc2 Chris W. Cox\uc2 , executive director of the National Rifle Association's Institute for Legislative Action. "We're worried, and we have reason to be."\par \par \uc2 During the primary campaign, Trump often started his rallies by reading depressing statistics about the economy of the town or state he was visiting, sometimes to the annoyance of local Republican leaders who have worked hard to boost their local economies. Republican governors have been especially sensitive to Trump's critiques.\par \par \uc2 At a rally in early May in South Bend, Ind., Trump said that the national unemployment rate is "20 percent or more" and that the official unemployment rate was created "to make politicians look good." Trump promised to stop the local air-conditioner factory from moving to Mexico, along with other improbable vows.\par \par \uc2 "Don't be depressed," Trump said, "because we're going to fix it."\par \par \uc2 Last week, Trump selected Indiana Gov. Mike Pence as his running mate and said that his primary reason for doing so was Indiana's booming economy, job creation and low unemployment rate.\par \par \uc2 At the convention Tuesday night, Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), who has closely advised Trump for months, sounded Trumpian in his description of the country.\par \par \uc2 "Our political system is not working. We operate like the trench warfare battles of World War I, where hundreds of thousands die but no ground is gained," Sessions said. "Median incomes have declined. Terrorist attacks are increasing. Respect for America has fallen. Crime is rising, and the president, he blames the police."\par \par \uc2 The theme Wednesday was "Make America First Again," but the topics and tone did not adjust accordingly. On stage, former House speaker \uc2 Newt Gingrich\uc2  (Ga.) said that the United States is losing the war on terrorism; that the threat to the nation was "worse than September 11" of 2001; and that electing Clinton could lead to a terrorist nuclear attack on a U.S. city.\par \par \uc2 Trump's campaign chairman, \uc2 Paul Manafort\uc2 , insisted that the tone this week has not been a downer. Instead, he said he senses a joyous vibe.\par \par \uc2 "There is an anger among the delegates that is out there in America," Manafort told reporters. "People are feeling frustrated by the failed leadership, by the difficult economic times and by their fear of living in their communities. But that's not the tone of the convention."\par \par \uc2 jenna.johnson@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 Scott Clement and Emily Guskin in Washington contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020160721ec7l002ux\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 the-fix\par {\*\bkmkstart toc57}{\*\bkmkend toc57}\b \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 's prepared speech to the Republican National convention, annotated ; His remarks as prepared for delivery.\b0\par\par\uc2 By Team Fix \par \uc2 4,460 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 July 2016\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 's prepared remarks accepting the Republican nomination in Cleveland Thursday night were provided on an embargoed basis. The embargo was broken by other news organizations -- therefore we are posting them here.\par \par \uc2 Friends, delegates and fellow Americans: I humbly and gratefully accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States.\par \par \uc2 Together, we will lead our party back to the White House, and we will lead our country back to safety, prosperity, and peace. We will be a country of generosity and warmth. But we will also be a country of law and order.\par \par \uc2 Our Convention occurs at a moment of crisis for our nation. The attacks on our police, and the terrorism in our cities, threaten our very way of life. Any politician who does not grasp this danger is not fit to lead our country. Americans watching this address tonight have seen the recent images of violence in our streets and the chaos in our communities. Many have witnessed this violence personally, some have even been its victims.\par \par \uc2 I have a message for all of you: the crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soon come to an end. Beginning on January 20th 2017, safety will be restored.\par \par \uc2 The most basic duty of government is to defend the lives of its own citizens. Any government that fails to do so is a government unworthy to lead.\par \par \uc2 It is finally time for a straightforward assessment of the state of our nation.\par \par \uc2 I will present the facts plainly and honestly.\par \par \uc2 We cannot afford to be so politically correct anymore.\par \par \uc2 So if you want to hear the corporate spin, the carefully-crafted lies, and the media myths the Democrats are holding their convention next week.\par \par \uc2 But here, at our convention, there will be no lies. We will honor the American people with the truth, and nothing else.\par \par \uc2 These are the facts:\par \par \uc2 Decades of progress made in bringing down crime are now being reversed by this Administration's rollback of criminal enforcement. Homicides last year increased by 17% in America's fifty largest cities. That's the largest increase in 25 years. In our nation's capital, killings have risen by 50 percent. They are up nearly 60% in nearby Baltimore.\par \par \uc2 In the President's hometown of Chicago, more than 2,000 have been the victims of shootings this year alone. And more than 3,600 have been killed in the Chicago area since he took office.\par \par \uc2 The number of police officers killed in the line of duty has risen by almost 50% compared to this point last year. Nearly 180,000 illegal immigrants with criminal records, ordered deported from our country, are tonight roaming free to threaten peaceful citizens.\par \par \uc2 The number of new \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  families who have crossed the border so far this year already exceeds the entire total from 2015. They are being released by the tens of thousands into our communities with no regard for the impact on public safety or resources. One such border-crosser was released and made his way to Nebraska. There, he ended the life of an innocent young girl named Sarah Root. She was 21 years-old, and was killed the day after graduating from college with a 4.0 Grade Point Average. Her killer was then released a second time, and he is now a fugitive from the law.\par \par \uc2 I've met Sarah's beautiful family. But to this Administration, their amazing daughter was just one more American life that wasn't worth protecting. One more child to sacrifice on the altar of open borders.\par \par \uc2 What about our economy? Again, I will tell you the plain facts that have been edited out of your nightly news and your morning newspaper:\par \par \uc2 Nearly 4-in-10 African-American children are living in poverty, while 58% of African-American youth are not employed. 2 million more Latinos are in poverty today than when the President took his oath of office less than eight years ago. Another 14 million people have left the workforce entirely.\par \par \uc2 Household incomes are down more than $4,000 since the year 2000. Our manufacturing trade deficit has reached an all-time high \u8212\'20\'14 nearly $800 billion in a single year.\par \par \uc2 The budget is no better. President \uc2 Obama\uc2  has doubled our national debt to more than $19 trillion, and growing.\par \par \uc2 Yet, what do we have to show for it? Our roads and bridges are falling apart, our airports are in Third World condition, and forty-three million Americans are on food stamps.\par \par \uc2 Now let us consider the state of affairs abroad. Not only have our citizens endured domestic disaster, but they have lived through one international humiliation after another. We all remember the images of our sailors being forced to their knees by their Iranian captors at gunpoint. This was just prior to the signing of the Iran deal, which gave back to Iran $150 billion and gave us nothing \u8212\'20\'14 it will go down in history as one of the worst deals ever made.\par \par \uc2 Another humiliation came when president \uc2 Obama\uc2  drew a red line in Syria \u8212\'20\'14 and the whole world knew it meant nothing. In Libya, our consulate \u8212\'20\'14 the symbol of American prestige around the globe \u8212\'20\'14 was brought down in flames.\par \par \uc2 America is far less safe \u8212\'20\'14 and the world is far less stable \u8212\'20\'14 than when \uc2 Obama\uc2  made the decision to put \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  in charge of America's foreign policy. I am certain it is a decision he truly regrets.\par \par \uc2 Her bad instincts and her bad judgment \u8212\'20\'14 something pointed out by Bernie Sanders \u8212\'20\'14 are what caused the disasters unfolding today. Let's review the record. In 2009, pre-Hillary, ISIS was not even on the map. Libya was cooperating. Egypt was peaceful. Iraq was seeing a reduction in violence. Iran was being choked by sanctions. Syria was under control.\par \par \uc2 After four years of \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 , what do we have? ISIS has spread across the region, and the world. Libya is in ruins, and our Ambassador and his staff were left helpless to die at the hands of savage killers. Egypt was turned over to the radical Muslim brotherhood, forcing the military to retake control.\par \par \uc2 Iraq is in chaos. Iran is on the path to nuclear weapons. Syria is engulfed in a civil war and a refugee crisis that now threatens the West. After fifteen years of wars in the Middle East, after trillions of dollars spent and thousands of lives lost, the situation is worse than it has ever been before.\par \par \uc2 This is the legacy of \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 : death, destruction and weakness. But \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 's legacy does not have to be America's legacy. The problems we face now \u8212\'20\'14 poverty and violence at home, war and destruction abroad \u8212\'20\'14 will last only as long as we continue relying on the same politicians who created them.\par \par \uc2 A change in leadership is required to change these outcomes. Tonight, I will share with you my plan of action for America.\par \par \uc2 The most important difference between our plan and that of our opponents, is that our plan will put America First. Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo. As long as we are led by politicians who will not put America First, then we can be assured that other nations will not treat America with respect.\par \par \uc2 This will all change in 2017. The American People will come first once again.\par \par \uc2 My plan will begin with safety at home \u8212\'20\'14 which means safe neighborhoods, secure borders, and protection from terrorism. There can be no prosperity without law and order. On the economy, I will outline reforms to add millions of new jobs and trillions in new wealth that can be used to rebuild America. A number of these reforms that I will outline tonight will be opposed by some of our nation's most powerful special interests.\par \par \uc2 That is because these interests have rigged our political and economic system for their exclusive benefit. Big business, elite media and major donors are lining up behind the campaign of my opponent because they know she will keep our rigged system in place. They are throwing money at her because they have total control over everything she does.\par \par \uc2 She is their puppet, and they pull the strings. That is why \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 's message is that things will never change. My message is that things have to change \u8212\'20\'14 and they have to change right now. Every day I wake up determined to deliver for the people I have met all across this nation that have been neglected, ignored, and abandoned.\par \par \uc2 I have visited the laid-off factory workers, and the communities crushed by our horrible and unfair trade deals. These are the forgotten men and women of our country. People who work hard but no longer have a voice.\par \par \uc2 I AM YOUR VOICE.\par \par \uc2 I have embraced crying mothers who have lost their children because our politicians put their personal agendas before the national good. I have no patience for injustice, no tolerance for government incompetence, no sympathy for leaders who fail their citizens. When innocent people suffer, because our political system lacks the will, or the courage, or the basic decency to enforce our laws \u8212\'20\'14 or worse still, has sold out to some corporate lobbyist for cash \u8212\'20\'14 I am not able to look the other way.\par \par \uc2 And when a Secretary of State illegally stores her emails on a private server, deletes 33,000 of them so the authorities can't see her crime, puts our country at risk, lies about it in every different form and faces no consequence \u8212\'20\'14 I know that corruption has reached a level like never before. When the FBI Director says that the Secretary of State was "extremely careless" and "negligent," in handling our classified secrets, I also know that these terms are minor compared to what she actually did. They were just used to save her from facing justice for her terrible crimes.\par \par \uc2 In fact, her single greatest accomplishment may be committing such an egregious crime and getting away with it \u8212\'20\'14 especially when others have paid so dearly. When that same Secretary of State rakes in millions of dollars trading access and favors to special interests and foreign powers I know the time for action has come. I have joined the political arena so that the powerful can no longer beat up on people that cannot defend themselves.\par \par \uc2 Nobody knows the system better than me, which is why I alone can fix it. I have seen firsthand how the system is rigged against our citizens, just like it was rigged against Bernie Sanders \u8212\'20\'14 he never had a chance. But his supporters will join our movement, because we will fix his biggest issue: trade. Millions of Democrats will join our movement, because we are going to fix the system so it works for all Americans. In this cause, I am proud to have at my side the next Vice President of the United States: Governor \uc2 Mike Pence\uc2  of Indiana. We will bring the same economic success to America that Mike brought to Indiana. He is a man of character and accomplishment. He is the right man for the job.\par \par \uc2 The first task for our new Administration will be to liberate our citizens from the crime and terrorism and lawlessness that threatens their communities. America was shocked to its core when our police officers in Dallas were brutally executed. In the days after Dallas, we have seen continued threats and violence against our law enforcement officials. Law officers have been shot or killed in recent days in Georgia, Missouri, Wisconsin, Kansas, Michigan and Tennessee. On Sunday, more police were gunned down in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Three were killed, and four were badly injured. An attack on law enforcement is an attack on all Americans.\par \par \uc2 I have a message to every last person threatening the peace on our streets and the safety of our police: when I take the oath of office next year, I will restore law and order to our country.\par \par \uc2 I will work with, and appoint, the best prosecutors and law enforcement officials in the country to get the job done. In this race for the White House, I am the Law And Order candidate.\par \par \uc2 The irresponsible rhetoric of our President, who has used the pulpit of the presidency to divide us by race and color, has made America a more dangerous environment for everyone. This Administration has failed America's inner cities.\par \par \uc2 It's failed them on education. It's failed them on jobs. It's failed them on crime. It's failed them at every level. When I am President, I will work to ensure that all of our kids are treated equally, and protected equally. Every action I take, I will ask myself: does this make life better for young Americans in Baltimore, Chicago, Detroit, Ferguson who have as much of a right to live out their dreams as any other child in America?\par \par \uc2 To make life safe in America, we must also address the growing threats we face from outside America: we are going to defeat the barbarians of ISIS.\par \par \uc2 Once again, France is the victim of brutal Islamic terrorism. Men, women and children viciously mowed down. Lives ruined. Families ripped apart. A nation in mourning. The damage and devastation that can be inflicted by Islamic radicals has been proven over and over \u8212\'20\'14 at the World Trade Center, at an office party in San Bernardino, at the Boston Marathon, and a military recruiting center in Chattanooga, Tennessee.\par \par \uc2 Only weeks ago, in Orlando, Florida, 49 wonderful Americans were savagely murdered by an Islamic terrorist. This time, the terrorist targeted our LGBT community. As your President, I will do everything in my power to protect our LGBT citizens from the violence and oppression of a hateful foreign ideology. protect us from terrorism, we need to focus on three things. We must have the best intelligence- gathering operation in the world. We must abandon the failed policy of nation- building and regime change that \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  pushed in Iraq, Libya, Egypt and Syria.\par \par \uc2 Instead, we must work with all of our allies who share our goal of destroying ISIS and stamping out Islamic terror. This includes working with our greatest ally in the region, the State of Israel. Lastly, we must immediately suspend immigration from any nation that has been compromised by terrorism until such time as proven vetting mechanisms have been put in place.\par \par \uc2 My opponent has called for a radical 550% increase in Syrian refugees on top of existing massive refugee flows coming into our country under President \uc2 Obama\uc2 . She proposes this despite the fact that there's no way to screen these refugees in order to find out who they are or where they come from. I only want to admit individuals into our country who will support our values and love our people. Anyone who endorses violence, hatred or oppression is not welcome in our country and never will be. Decades of record immigration have produced lower wages and higher unemployment for our citizens, especially for African-American and Latino workers. We are going to have an immigration system that works, but one that works for the American people.\par \par \uc2 On Monday, we heard from three parents whose children were killed by illegal immigrantsMary Ann Mendoza, Sabine Durden, and Jamiel Shaw.\par \par \uc2 They are just three brave representatives of many thousands. Of all my travels in this country, nothing has affected me more deeply than the time I have spent with the mothers and fathers who have lost their children to violence spilling across our border. These families have no special interests to represent them. There are no demonstrators to protest on their behalf.\par \par \uc2 My opponent will never meet with them, or share in their pain. Instead, my opponent wants Sanctuary Cities. But where was sanctuary for Kate Steinle? Where was Sanctuary for the children of Mary Ann, Sabine and Jamiel? Where was sanctuary for all the other Americans who have been so brutally murdered, and who have suffered so horribly?\par \par \uc2 These wounded American families have been alone. But they are alone no longer. Tonight, this candidate and this whole nation stand in their corner to support them, to send them our love, and to pledge in their honor that we will save countless more families from suffering the same awful fate. We are going to build a great border wall to stop illegal immigration, to stop the gangs and the violence, and to stop the drugs from pouring into our communities.\par \par \uc2 I have been honored to receive the endorsement of America's Border Patrol Agents, and will work directly with them to protect the integrity of our lawful immigration system. By ending catch-and-release on the border, we will stop the cycle of human smuggling and violence. Illegal border crossings will go down. Peace will be restored. By enforcing the rules for the millions who overstay their visas, our laws will finally receive the respect they deserve.\par \par \uc2 Tonight, I want every American whose demands for immigration security have been denied \u8212\'20\'14 and every politician who has denied them \u8212\'20\'14 to listen very closely to the words I am about to say. On January 21st of 2017, the day after I take the oath of office, Americans will finally wake up in a country where the laws of the United States are enforced.\par \par \uc2 We are going to be considerate and compassionate to everyone. But my greatest compassion will be for our own struggling citizens. My plan is the exact opposite of the radical and dangerous immigration policy of \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 . Americans want relief from uncontrolled immigration. Communities want relief. Yet \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  is proposing mass amnesty, mass immigration, and mass lawlessness. Her plan will overwhelm your schools and hospitals, further reduce your jobs and wages, and make it harder for recent immigrants to escape from poverty. I have a different vision for our workers. It begins with a new, fair trade policy that protects our jobs and stands up to countries that cheat.\par \par \uc2 It's been a signature message of my campaign from day one, and it will be a signature feature of my presidency from the moment I take the oath of office.\par \par \uc2 I have made billions of dollars in business making deals \u8212\'20\'14 now I'm going to make our country rich again. I am going to turn our bad trade agreements into great ones. America has lost nearly-one third of its manufacturing jobs since 1997, following the enactment of disastrous trade deals supported by Bill and \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 . Remember, it was \uc2 Bill Clinton\uc2  who signed \uc2 NAFTA\uc2 , one of the worst economic deals ever made by our country. Never again. I am going to bring our jobs back to Ohio and to America \u8212\'20\'14 and I am not going to let companies move to other countries, firing their employees along the way, without consequences.\par \par \uc2 My opponent, on the other hand, has supported virtually every trade agreement that has been destroying our middle class. She supported \uc2 NAFTA\uc2 , and she supported China's entrance into the \uc2 World Trade Organization\uc2  \u8212\'20\'14 another one of her husband's colossal mistakes. She supported the job- killing trade deal with South Korea. She has supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The TPP will not only destroy our manufacturing, but it will make America subject to the rulings of foreign governments.\par \par \uc2 I pledge to never sign any trade agreement that hurts our workers, or that diminishes our freedom and independence. Instead, I will make individual deals with individual countries. No longer will we enter into these massive deals, with many countries, that are thousands of pages long \u8212\'20\'14 and which no one from our country even reads or understands.\par \par \uc2 We are going to enforce all trade violations, including through the use of taxes and tariffs, against any country that cheats. This includes stopping China's outrageous theft of intellectual property, along with their illegal product dumping, and their devastating currency manipulation. Our horrible trade agreements with China and many others, will be totally renegotiated. That includes renegotiating \uc2 NAFTA\uc2  to get a much better deal for America \u8212\'20\'14 and we'll walk away if we don't get the deal that we want.\par \par \uc2 We are going to start building and making things again. Next comes the reform of our tax laws, regulations and energy rules. While \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  plans a massive tax increase, I have proposed the largest tax reduction of any candidate who has declared for the presidential race this year \u8212\'20\'14 Democrat or Republican.\par \par \uc2 Middle-income Americans will experience profound relief, and taxes will be simplified for everyone. America is one of the highest-taxed nations in the world. Reducing taxes will cause new companies and new jobs to come roaring back into our country. Then we are going to deal with the issue of regulation, one of the greatest job-killers of them all. Excessive regulation is costing our country as much as $2 trillion a year, and we will end it. We are going to lift the restrictions on the production of American energy.\par \par \uc2 This will produce more than $20 trillion in job- creating economic activity over the next four decades. My opponent, on the other hand, wants to put the great miners and steel workers of our country out of work \u8212\'20\'14 that will never happen when I am President. With these new economic policies, trillions of dollars will start flowing into our country. This new wealth will improve the quality of life for all Americans \u8212\'20\'14 We will build the roads, highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, and the railways of tomorrow. This, in turn, will create millions more jobs. We will rescue kids from failing schools by helping their parents send them to a safe school of their choice. My opponent would rather protect education bureaucrats than serve American children.\par \par \uc2 We will repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare. You will be able to choose your own doctor again. And we will fix TSA at the airports! We will completely rebuild our depleted military, and the countries that we protect, at a massive loss, will be asked to pay their fair share. We will take care of our great Veterans like they have never been taken care of before.\par \par \uc2 My opponent dismissed the VA scandal as being not widespread \u8212\'20\'14 one more sign of how out of touch she really is. We are going to ask every Department Head in government to provide a list of wasteful spending projects that we can eliminate in my first 100 days. The politicians have talked about it, I'm going to do it. We are also going to appoint justices to the \uc2 United States Supreme Court\uc2  who will uphold our laws and our Constitution.\par \par \uc2 The replacement for Justice Scalia will be a person of similar views and principles. This will be one of the most important issues decided by this election. My opponent wants to essentially abolish the 2nd amendment. I, on the other hand, received the early and strong endorsement of the \uc2 National Rifle Association\uc2  and will protect the right of all Americans to keep their families safe.\par \par \uc2 At this moment, I would like to thank the evangelical community who have been so good to me and so supportive. You have so much to contribute to our politics, yet our laws prevent you from speaking your minds from your own pulpits. An amendment, pushed by Lyndon Johnson, many years ago, threatens religious institutions with a loss of their tax-exempt status if they openly advocate their political views.\par \par \uc2 I am going to work very hard to repeal that language and protect free speech for all Americans. We can accomplish these great things, and so much else \u8212\'20\'14 all we need to do is start believing in ourselves and in our country again. It is time to show the whole world that America Is Back \u8212\'20\'14 bigger, and better and stronger than ever before. In this journey, I'm so lucky to have at my side my wife Melania and my wonderful children, Don, Ivanka, Eric, Tiffany, and Barron: you will always be my greatest source of pride and joy.\par \par \uc2 My Dad, Fred Trump, was the smartest and hardest working man I ever knew. I wonder sometimes what he'd say if he were here to see this tonight. It's because of him that I learned, from my youngest age, to respect the dignity of work and the dignity of working people. He was a guy most comfortable in the company of bricklayers, carpenters, and electricians and I have a lot of that in me also.\par \par \uc2 Then there's my mother, Mary. She was strong, but also warm and fair-minded. She was a truly great mother. She was also one of the most honest and charitable people I have ever known, and a great judge of character. To my sisters Mary Anne and Elizabeth, my brother Robert and my late brother Fred, I will always give you my loveyou are most special to me.\par \par \uc2 I have loved my life in business. But now, my sole and exclusive mission is to go to work for our country \u8212\'20\'14 to go to work for all of you. It's time to deliver a victory for the American people. But to do that, we must break free from the petty politics of the past. America is a nation of believers, dreamers, and strivers that is being led by a group of censors, critics, and cynics.\par \par \uc2 Remember: all of the people telling you that you can't have the country you want, are the same people telling you that I wouldn't be standing here tonight. No longer can we rely on those elites in media, and politics, who will say anything to keep a rigged system in place. Instead, we must choose to Believe In America.\par \par \uc2 History is watching us now. It's waiting to see if we will rise to the occasion, and if we will show the whole world that America is still free and independent and strong. My opponent asks her supporters to recite a three-word loyalty pledge. It reads: "I'm With Her". I choose to recite a different pledge.\par \par \uc2 My pledge reads: "I'M WITH YOU \u8212\'20\'14 THE AMERICAN PEOPLE."\par \par \uc2 I am your voice.\par \par \uc2 So to every parent who dreams for their child, and every child who dreams for their future, I say these words to you tonight: I'm With You, and I will fight for you, and I will win for you.\par \par \uc2 To all Americans tonight, in all our cities and towns, I make this promise:\par \par \uc2 We Will Make America Strong Again.\par \par \uc2 We Will Make America Proud Again.\par \par \uc2 We Will Make America Safe Again.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020160721ec7l0086h\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 There is no issue more central to \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 's campaign than immigration. There is also no issue on which he and his disciples fabricate more egregiously.\par \par \uc2 Rudy Giuliani says \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  is for open borders. She's not. Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), who regularly relies on faulty data from anti-immigrant extremist groups such as FAIR, was at it again, claiming in his speech last night that 350,000 illegal immigrants come over the border each year. Nonsense. The Post's Fact Checkers explain:\par \par \uc2 It's unclear what data Sessions is using here. He may be referring to 2006 \uc2 Pew Research Center\uc2  findings that about 250,000 to 350,000 people were added to the unauthorized immigrant population in the United States due to visa overstays. But visa overstays do not describe people who "succeed in crossing our borders illegally each year."\par \par \uc2 Without phony figures, there's no need for a wall, of course. And Sessions, who opposes most legal immigration as well, personified the false theory (the "lump of labor fallacy") that there are only so many jobs in America. "The fact is, we don't have enough jobs for the people who are here," he insists. "Doesn't this help to explain why our wages have fallen and why we have the lowest percentage of Americans actually holding a job in 40 years?" No, actually it doesn't. In fact, his own state would be helped by some legal immigration.\par \par \uc2 According to a \uc2 Regional Economic Models Inc\uc2 . (REMI) report, "Undocumented immigrants enrolling in the Pathway to Legal Status will have a positive effect on the State of Alabama and its citizens. For every person who enrolls, REMI estimates that more than $997 will be added to Gross State Product in 2014 and this will increase to more than $4,499 by 2020. \u160\'00\'A0REMI also estimates that by 2020 real personal income per capita in Alabama will increase by $120." For high-skilled immigration, the picture is even rosier:\par \par \uc2 REMI estimates that an expansion of the H-1B visa program would add more than 220 new high-skilled workers in the state of Alabama in 2014. This expansion would result in more than 1,600 total new jobs in 2014 and more than 3,200 new jobs by 2020. In 2014, the expansion would add more than $140 million to Gross State Product and increase personal income by $77 million. By 2045, the expansion would add about $1.5 billion to Gross State Product and increase personal income by more than $1.4 billion.\par \par \uc2 Sessions doesn't know what is good for his own state.\par \par \uc2 The presumption by grieving families that lax immigration security is responsible for their loved one's deaths is, if not false, misguided. Tragically, many more law enforcement officers lose their lives due to actions of native-born Americans. Jason L. Riley\u160\'00\'A0wrote last year:\par \par \uc2 Numerous studies going back more than a century have shown that immigrants\u8212\'20\'14regardless of nationality or legal status\u8212\'20\'14are less likely than the native population to commit violent crimes or to be incarcerated. A new\u160\'00\'A0report from the Immigration Policy Center notes that while the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  population in the U.S. more than tripled between 1990 and 2013 to more than 11.2 million, "\uc2 FBI\uc2  data indicate that the violent crime rate declined 48%\u8212\'20\'14which included falling rates of aggravated assault, robbery, rape, and murder. Likewise, the property crime rate fell 41%, including declining rates of motor vehicle theft, larceny/robbery, and burglary."\par \par \uc2 Trump, of course, is not going to let facts get in the way. It is telling that his focus on the fake border issue -- and Hispanic immigrants -- ignores the much bigger problem of visa overstays, which affect immigrants from all over the world. It is hard to deny that targeting Hispanics, making up phony facts about them and labeling them "criminals" is anything but rank racism.\par \par \uc2 Interestingly, \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  gave an interview to Charlie Rose on Monday night. She argued that Trump would be divisive. "Well, the way he has been in this campaign -- he has set groups of Americans against one another," she said. "The language he has used -- to scapegoat, literally demean, denigrate groups of people starting with immigrants, going so far as to raise questions about the qualifications of a highly qualified federal judge born in the United States, whose parents were from Mexico." She went on: "[Trump]\u160\'00\'A0has a really small vision of the American Dream. 'The American Dream is only so big. And boy, you know, some people are now in it who weren't there 50, 60, 70 years ago. So we wanna go back to the way it was.' That's nonsense. We can't turn the clock back."\par \par \uc2 It's also true that Trump's divisiveness has come to define him. It's what is front and center at his convention. That it is built on lies and exaggerations only adds to the scary prospect of a president dismissive of reality, decency and comprehension of the American experience.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020160719ec7j006bz\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 CLEVELAND \u8212\'20\'14 They turned the volume up to 11 on Monday. The protesters, partisans and rabble-rousers arrived in full force, their movements shadowed by scores of police officers.\par \par \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  supporters, some affiliated with far-right organizations that have a dim view of the Republican establishment, held a rally by the Cuyahoga River, chanting "Hillary for prison!" and lambasting "globalists," the elite media and GOP operatives determined to deny Trump the nomination.\par \par \uc2 Equally passionate Trump protesters marched through the streets demanding an end to police brutality and anti-immigrant policies, and chanting "Dump Trump!" and "Hey hey! Ho ho! \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  has got to go!"\par \par \uc2 The two groups were only a few blocks apart but never crossed paths. Nor was such an encounter likely given the extraordinary police presence, with many officers from as far away as California and Florida. The Cleveland police chief has said there are "thousands" of officers from "hundreds" of departments on hand.\par \par \uc2 Local officials and political observers have been concerned about clashes between the pro- and anti-Trump factions, a scenario made more ominous by Ohio's "open carry" law permitting citizens to carry loaded handguns and rifles.\par \par \uc2 "If there's gunfire that erupts, the guys that are armed, they're probably going to fire back," predicted Pete Bryan, 49, a Dayton, Ohio, auto dealership employee who was part of a Bikers for Trump contingent at the river rally.\par \par \uc2 But as the gavel dropped on the Republican National Convention on Monday, the scene on the streets continued to reflect the First Amendment rather than the Second. The city was not full of ordinary citizens walking around with assault rifles strapped to their backs. So far.\par \par \uc2 The Trump rally was organized by controversial former Trump adviser Roger Stone and was promoted by Alex Jones, proprietor of the conspiracy-slinging website Infowars. A series of speakers invoked Trump's theme of making America great again, and one woman told the story of how her son was tortured and murdered by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Then Jones, wearing a blue blazer that clashed with the biker garb around him, took the stage. The crowd surged forward. Jones spoke in tones ranging from loud to roaring. His rhetoric became so hot, he threatened to catch the Cuyahoga on fire.\par \par \uc2 "This planet and the globalists have not seen anything yet!" he bellowed.\par \par \uc2 He said authorities had imposed a no-fly zone around Cleveland, which explained the absence of the airplane that had been pulling a "Hillary for Prison" banner over the weekend.\par \par \uc2 "They're afraid of free speech," he said. "These are anti-free-speech, anti-freedom scum who need to get their ass to North Korea!"\par \par \uc2 He called \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  a foreign agent of the communist Chinese and the Saudis, and went on to lionize Trump: "Everything he's been doing has simply been absolutely over-the-top amazing."\par \par \uc2 Less than a mile away, hundreds of Trump protesters gathered in Cleveland's Veterans Memorial Park, many with banners and placards condemning the presumptive GOP nominee. Some had walked all the way to Cleveland from Chicago. But many organizations on the political left have decided to skip the Republican convention, seeing little to gain from the gathering, and to focus instead on the Democratic convention, where protests might conceivably have more influence.\par \par \uc2 "This isn't a rally of the biggest names in the world, but there are real activists here with real struggles," Mick Kelly, a member of the Coalition to Stop Trump and March on the \uc2 RNC\uc2 , told the crowd, which included groups opposed to corporations and capitalism, and supporting gay and lesbian rights and immigrant rights.\par \par \uc2 Clutching a sign demanding that Trump read the Constitution, Faten Odeh, a social sciences teacher and a Muslim who lives in Cleveland, said she had come out to oppose the divisive rhetoric of the Trump campaign.\par \par \uc2 "Our Constitution says that all men are created equal, and that all people have the right to life, love and the pursuit of happiness no matter what," she said. "It doesn't specify that you have to be white, it doesn't specify that you have to be Christian."\par \par \uc2 After a series of speeches, the protesters began a raucous but fundamentally orderly march through the streets, passing within a few blocks of the Trump rally and then directly by Quicken Loans Arena, where Trump is scheduled to accept the GOP nomination Thursday night. The march followed a planned route, with many people wearing red or black T-shirts and carrying banners.\par \par \uc2 "We're here to show that these streets are ours, too. No Trump supporter, no policeman can shut us down," shouted one protester, his face covered by a thick scarf as the midday sun beat overhead.\par \par \uc2 The march appeared to have at least 1,000 participants, though any crowd estimate was complicated by the heavy presence of \uc2 Amnesty International\uc2  observers, lawyers poised to offer legal help for protesters facing charges, peacekeepers, journalists, self-directed videographers and presumably a large number of undercover law enforcement officers.\par \par \uc2 The marchers made it back to their starting point without a hitch. Tensions rose moments later when a group of religious extremists appeared, timing their arrival with the end of the march. Police used their bikes to separate the two sides, standing their ground as the group identifying itself as "Bible Believers" screamed homophobic slurs through megaphones and excoriated Black Lives Matter protesters.\par \par \uc2 Both sides sloped away quietly in the end, thronged by many of the 15,000 journalists who have descended on Cleveland.\par \par \uc2 The police have been low-key so far, staying back and essentially escorting protesters through a city lined with barricades, fences and barriers. Police Chief Calvin Williams said Monday that a modest-size protest Sunday had culminated in a single arrest. A protester, whom he described as possibly having mental problems, grabbed a gas mask from a police officer and was charged with petty theft.\par \par \uc2 Williams himself spent three hours Sunday night riding around his city on a new, $2,000 Safariland bicycle made expressly for law enforcement, one of 300 bikes purchased for crowd control in advance of the convention.\par \par \uc2 He said his officers are keenly aware of the killings of police officers in Dallas and Baton Rouge. After Dallas, he said, he ordered his officers to ride in pairs and not to patrol alone.\par \par \uc2 He said he made sure Sunday that his commanders learned about what happened in Baton Rouge, but he did not indicate any changes in tactics. After the news conference, he said that he doesn't personally worry about being targeted.\par \par \uc2 "If you worried about that, I'd be going like this all day long," he said, turning his head side to side as if scouting enemies. "I don't walk around thinking somebody's going to snipe me. I don't do that. You can't function like that."\par \par \uc2 joel.achenbach@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 louisa.loveluck@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020160718ec7i007by\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 CLEVELAND -- The first night of the 2016 Republican National Convention was purportedly about national security. In fact, it was about portraying liberalism as an ideology of national betrayal. Speaker after speaker intimated that President Obama, \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  or both are directly responsible for a variety of American deaths because they value the lives of foreigners over those of their countrymen.\par \par \uc2 The evening took an early dip into the gutter when Republicans trotted out Patricia Smith, a grieving mother of a man who died in the Benghazi attacks, who practically accused \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  of murdering her child. "For all of this loss, for all of this grief, for all of the cynicism the tragedy in Benghazi has wrought upon America, I blame \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 ," she said. "I blame \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  personally for the death of my son." Multiple investigations suggest different conclusions, but few of the presentations Monday night were substantive. The fact that Smith seemed to be on the verge of tears conveyed the desired pathos. Her grief-stricken anger is understandable. Republicans' decision to exploit her grief to execute a cheap attack on Clinton is not. Yet Smith turned out to be just the first in a series of victims willing to blame their tragedies on Clinton.\par \par \uc2 Next came Mark Geist and John Tiegen, members of the Benghazi security team. They claimed at a partisan political convention, that the Benghazi tale is not "about politics," before insisting that, "had [Clinton] done her job that night\u8230\'20\'26Ty, Glen, Sean, and Ambassador Stevens would be alive today."\par \par \uc2 Then came Mary Mendoza, another grieving mother, who said that her son was killed by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  driving while drunk and high on methamphetamine. "It's time that we have an administration that cares more about Americans than illegals," she proclaimed. "A vote for Hillary is putting all of our children's lives at risk."\par \par \uc2 In case you thought that Republicans were merely accusing Obama and Clinton of incompetence, Rep. Mike McCaul (R-Texas) encouraged the audience to see national tragedies as at least partially intentional.\u160\'00\'A0"Today, our allies no longer trust us, our adversaries no longer fear us and our enemies are plotting against us. This did not happen by accident. It happened by design," he said. "It is the work of \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  and the architect of his failed foreign policy, \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 ." He explained: "Instead of protecting Americans, the Obama administration turned a blind eye to the danger."\par \par \uc2 Gen. Michael Flynn later followed this up by lambasting Obama and Clinton's "bumbling indecisiveness, willful ignorance and total incompetence that has challenged the very heart and soul of every American and single-handedly brought continued mayhem, murder and destruction into our neighborhoods and onto the world's streets" [emphasis mine]. "I shudder to think of how many times our flags will fly at half mast" if Clinton becomes president Rep. Ryan Zinke (R-Mont.) said near the end of the night.\par \par \uc2 Why would Obama and Clinton abdicate their responsibilities? The 2016 GOP platform offers an answer: "The leadership of the Democratic Party, both those in office and those who seek it, no longer see America as a force for good in the world."\par \par \uc2 None of the speakers discussed Trump much, save for his wife, Melania, who -- besides apparently plagiarizing\u160\'00\'A0\uc2 Michelle Obama\uc2  -- said that her husband is a warm man who respects minority groups, but offered no examples of Trump's well-hidden virtues.\par \par \uc2 Yet, in a way, the GOP's Monday night anti-Democrat diatribe was about Trump. If, as Trump and his allies allege, the country is in a poor state because of perfidy of those running it, he does not have to cite real facts or provide substantive details about how he would fix the nation's problems. Instead, all he needs to do is promise not to betray the country. Demonizing one's political enemies is toxic for the nation's democratic institutions and political culture, but that didn't seem to bother the crowd much. Other than "U-S-A, U-S-A," one of the most common chants from the floor Monday night was, "Lock her up! Lock her up!"\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020160719ec7j001xh\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 A-Section\par {\*\bkmkstart toc61}{\*\bkmkend toc61}\b \uc2 Passions run high, but protests and rallies are orderly\b0\par\par\uc2 Joel Achenbach                Louisa Loveluck \par \uc2 1,174 \uc2 words\par \uc2 19 July 2016\par \uc2 The Washington Post\par \uc2 WP\par \uc2 FINAL\par A09\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved \par \par \uc2 CLEVELAND - They turned the volume up to 11 on Monday. The protesters, partisans and rabble-rousers arrived in full force, their movements shadowed by scores of police officers.\par \par \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  supporters, some affiliated with far-right organizations that have a dim view of the Republican establishment, held a rally by the Cuyahoga River, chanting "Hillary for prison!" and lambasting "globalists," the elite media and GOP operatives determined to deny Trump the nomination.\par \par \uc2 Equally passionate Trump protesters marched through the streets demanding an end to police brutality and anti-immigrant policies, and chanting "Dump Trump!" and "Hey hey! Ho ho! \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  has got to go!"\par \par \uc2 The two groups were only a few blocks apart but never crossed paths. Nor was such an encounter likely given the extraordinary police presence, with many officers from as far away as California and Florida. The Cleveland police chief has said there are "thousands" of officers from "hundreds" of departments on hand.\par \par \uc2 Local officials and political observers have been concerned about clashes between the pro- and anti-Trump factions, a scenario made more ominous by Ohio's "open carry" law permitting citizens to carry loaded handguns and rifles.\par \par \uc2 "If there's gunfire that erupts, the guys that are armed, they're probably going to fire back," predicted Pete Bryan, 49, a Dayton, Ohio, auto dealership employee who was part of a Bikers for Trump contingent at the river rally.\par \par \uc2 But as the gavel dropped on the Republican National Convention on Monday, the scene on the streets continued to reflect the First Amendment rather than the Second. The city was not full of ordinary citizens walking around with assault rifles strapped to their backs. So far.\par \par \uc2 The Trump rally was organized by controversial former Trump adviser Roger Stone and was promoted by Alex Jones, proprietor of the conspiracy-slinging website Infowars. A series of speakers invoked Trump's theme of making America great again, and one woman told the story of how her son was tortured and murdered by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Then Jones, wearing a blue blazer that clashed with the biker garb around him, took the stage. The crowd surged forward. Jones spoke in tones ranging from loud to roaring. His rhetoric became so hot, he threatened to catch the Cuyahoga on fire.\par \par \uc2 "This planet and the globalists have not seen anything yet!" he bellowed.\par \par \uc2 He said authorities had imposed a no-fly zone around Cleveland, which explained the absence of the airplane that had been pulling a "Hillary for Prison" banner over the weekend.\par \par \uc2 "They're afraid of free speech," he said. "These are anti-free-speech, anti-freedom scum who need to get their ass to North Korea!"\par \par \uc2 He called \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  a foreign agent of the communist Chinese and the Saudis, and went on to lionize Trump: "Everything he's been doing has simply been absolutely over-the-top amazing."\par \par \uc2 Less than a mile away, hundreds of Trump protesters gathered in Cleveland's Veterans Memorial Park, many with banners and placards condemning the presumptive GOP nominee. Some had walked all the way to Cleveland from Chicago. But many organizations on the political left have decided to skip the Republican convention, seeing little to gain from the gathering, and to focus instead on the Democratic convention, where protests might conceivably have more influence.\par \par \uc2 "This isn't a rally of the biggest names in the world, but there are real activists here with real struggles," Mick Kelly, a member of the Coalition to Stop Trump and March on the \uc2 RNC\uc2 , told the crowd, which included groups opposed to corporations and capitalism, and supporting gay and lesbian rights and immigrant rights.\par \par \uc2 Clutching a sign demanding that Trump read the Constitution, Faten Odeh, a social sciences teacher and a Muslim who lives in Cleveland, said she had come out to oppose the divisive rhetoric of the Trump campaign.\par \par \uc2 "Our Constitution says that all men are created equal, and that all people have the right to life, love and the pursuit of happiness no matter what," she said. "It doesn't specify that you have to be white, it doesn't specify that you have to be Christian."\par \par \uc2 After a series of speeches, the protesters began a raucous but fundamentally orderly march through the streets, passing within a few blocks of the Trump rally and then directly by Quicken Loans Arena, where Trump is scheduled to accept the GOP nomination Thursday night. The march followed a planned route, with many people wearing red or black T-shirts and carrying banners.\par \par \uc2 "We're here to show that these streets are ours, too. No Trump supporter, no policeman can shut us down," shouted one protester, his face covered by a thick scarf as the midday sun beat overhead.\par \par \uc2 The march appeared to have at least 1,000 participants, though any crowd estimate was complicated by the heavy presence of \uc2 Amnesty International\uc2  observers, lawyers poised to offer legal help for protesters facing charges, peacekeepers, journalists, self-directed videographers and presumably a large number of undercover law enforcement officers.\par \par \uc2 The marchers made it back to their starting point without a hitch. Tensions rose moments later when a group of religious extremists appeared, timing their arrival with the end of the march. Police used their bikes to separate the two sides, standing their ground as the group identifying itself as "Bible Believers" screamed homophobic slurs through megaphones and excoriated Black Lives Matter protesters.\par \par \uc2 Both sides sloped away quietly in the end, thronged by many of the 15,000 journalists who have descended on Cleveland.\par \par \uc2 The police have been low-key so far, staying back and essentially escorting protesters through a city lined with barricades, fences and barriers. Police Chief Calvin Williams said Monday that a modest-size protest Sunday had culminated in a single arrest. A protester, whom he described as possibly having mental problems, grabbed a gas mask from a police officer and was charged with petty theft.\par \par \uc2 Williams himself spent three hours Sunday night riding around his city on a new, $2,000 Safariland bicycle made expressly for law enforcement, one of 300 bikes purchased for crowd control in advance of the convention.\par \par \uc2 He said his officers are keenly aware of the killings of police officers in Dallas and Baton Rouge. After Dallas, he said, he ordered his officers to ride in pairs and not to patrol alone.\par \par \uc2 He said he made sure Sunday that his commanders learned about what happened in Baton Rouge, but he did not indicate any changes in tactics. After the news conference, he said that he doesn't personally worry about being targeted.\par \par \uc2 "If you worried about that, I'd be going like this all day long," he said, turning his head side to side as if scouting enemies. "I don't walk around thinking somebody's going to snipe me. I don't do that. You can't function like that."\par \par \uc2 joel.achenbach@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 louisa.loveluck@washpost.com \par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com\par \par \uc2 WP20160719cleveland0719\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020160719ec7j00027\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

Trump wouldn't. ; The questionnaire for possible running mates makes clear that \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  wouldn\u8217\'20\'19t qualify for the No. 2 spot.\b0\par\par\uc2 By Jon Cowan;Jim Kessler \par \uc2 575 \uc2 words\par \uc2 7 July 2016\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  and his team are now vetting possible vice presidential picks, a process that former almost second banana Evan Bayh (D-Ind.) described as a colonoscopy using the Hubble telescope. In charge of the vetting is A.B. Culvahouse, a consummate Washington insider who ran the same process for \uc2 John McCain\uc2  in 2008. But imagine if Ted Cruz or \uc2 Marco Rubio\uc2  had won the nomination and Trump emerged on the vice presidential short list. How would Trump do? Let's take a peek inside the vetting questionnaire which has grown from 16 questions in 1976 to 79 headings and more than 200 specific queries in 2012.\par \par \uc2 Start off with a few of the biggies. Any issues with marital infidelity or avoiding the draft in your past? From there, the questions only get more difficult. On the vetting murder boards is a plagiarism question, probably the result of then-presidential candidate \uc2 Joe Biden\uc2 's misappropriation in 1987 of a speech by British politician Neil Kinnock. Those few paragraphs of unattributed spoken word seem quaint in comparison to the 20 pages cut and pasted from another author's book and featured as original Trump genius at his eponymous institute.\par \par \uc2 What used to be known as the "nanny" question concerns the hiring of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  labor, a mistake that felled the nomination of \uc2 Zoe Baird\uc2  for attorney general in 1993. She hired one \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  to babysit her children. \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  hired at least hundreds to build his real estate empire. To paraphrase Joseph Stalin, hiring one \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  is disqualifying; hiring hundreds is a statistic.\par \par \uc2 Vice presidential candidates are asked if there are any court records worth noting; for example, have you been involved in a lawsuit? The ideal answer probably shouldn't be 169, which published reports say is the minimum number of times Trump has been named in a suit. Sexual harassment allegations are asked about and explored. With Mr. Trump, let's just stipulate that this line of inquiry could take a while. An even longer slog, however, is the more general "is there any claim anyone can make about you saying something racist or offensive in your past?"\par \par \uc2 Trump has said many times that he was an excellent student and thrived at the best schools, but the vetting process is not the ideal pop quiz for this candidate. And we haven't even gotten to the most basic finance questions that constitute the backbone of candidate approval. Investments overseas, entanglements with foreign governments, charitable donations, complying with federal tax laws, assets owned and traded, and actual net worth. Of course, the vetting research for the No. 2 spot centers upon the release of the candidate's tax returns, something Trump has so far evaded.\par \par \uc2 No candidate for the vice presidential slot is expected to be 100 percent clean on every single question. We're not electing saints. But getting a few right would be nice. The bottom line is that the vetting process shows without equivocation that Trump is unqualified to be a heartbeat away from the presidency. If he's not acceptable for No. 2 on the ticket, it begs the question of whether he's fit to be No. 1.\par \par \uc2 print and web e-mail address\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020160707ec770030f\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 the-fix\par {\*\bkmkstart toc63}{\*\bkmkend toc63}\b \uc2 The 2016 election is demonstrating exactly why people don't trust politicians ; \uc2 Marco Rubio\uc2  is just the latest example.\b0\par\par\uc2 By Aaron Blake \par \uc2 1,134 \uc2 words\par \uc2 22 June 2016\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Marco Rubio\uc2  wasn't going to run for reelection in 2016, and he was completely exasperated by the fact that the media had the nerve to\u160\'00\'A0keep asking him about it. So he tweeted this:\par \par \uc2 I have only said like 10000 times I will be a private citizen in January.\par \par \uc2 Marco Rubio\uc2 , as you might have heard, is now running for reelection -- despite numerous promises that he wouldn't do it or that it wasn't in his plans. He has said the attack on Orlando 10 days ago changed things for him, but even before then, it was clear that there was some potential\u160\'00\'A0waffling going on.\par \par \uc2 And you wonder why people don't trust what politicians say.\par \par \uc2 We are picking on Rubio here because his 180\u160\'00\'A0is the most recent and arguably one of the most egregious examples of a politician making a promise they couldn't keep or saying something that is later contradicted. But the 2016 election has been chock full of this kind of double talk.\par \par \uc2 We're not talking about fact-checking here; that's been done, and well-cataloged. We're talking about when a politician says things that contradict not the facts, but themselves.\par \par \uc2 It's not always a politician saying one thing and doing the exact opposite. Sometimes it's saying one thing and then saying another thing, when the politics change, that appears to run completely counter to what you said before. Sometimes it's saying something that just plain strains credulity and rational thought.\par \par \uc2 This can happen\u160\'00\'A0over the course of a few months; it can also happen in\u160\'00\'A0a few weeks or even days.\u160\'00\'A0Below are some key examples in the 2016 election. (It is necessarily an incomplete list.)\par \par \uc2 BEFORE: During the 2016 campaign\par \par \uc2 "If we're going to turn our frustration and anger with the D.C. insiders and the politicians of yesterday and the carnival barkers of today into something that will actually change Americans' lives, then we must elect someone who has been tested, someone with proven experience."\par \par \uc2 "We could wind up turning over the White House to \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  for four more years," he said of nominating Trump. That prospect, he said, would be "like the eight years we've just had, except worse."\par \par \uc2 AFTER: In endorsing Trump\par \par \uc2 "I've gotten to know all the people on that stage, and there is no one who is better prepared to provide America with the strong leadership that it needs, both at home and around the world, than \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 ."\par \par \uc2 BEFORE: During the 2016 campaign\par \par \uc2 "If you're a Republican and your choice is \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  and Ted Cruz in a general election," he said, "it's the difference between poisoned or shot -- you're still dead."\par \par \uc2 "Ted Cruz's foreign policy has been uneven and he has done more to allow ISIL to gain a foothold in Syria than any Senator other than \uc2 Rand Paul\uc2 ."\par \par \uc2 "Ted's smart, but I think that \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  would do a number on him."\par \par \uc2 AFTER: When the race boiled down to Cruz vs. Trump\par \par \uc2 "I have doubts about Mr. Trump, I don't think he's a Republican, I don't think he's a conservative, I think his campaign's built on xenophobia, race-baiting and religious bigotry, I think he'd be a disaster for our party and as Senator Cruz would not be my first choice, I think he is a Republican conservative who I could support."\par \par \uc2 BEFORE: Every GOP candidate pledged to support the GOP nominee\u160\'00\'A0in 2015, and Cruz reiterated in March that he would back even Trump:\u160\'00\'A0"I committed at the outset, I will support the Republican nominee, whoever it is."\par \par \uc2 AFTER: Ted Cruz and John Kasich still haven't endorsed Trump. Neither has Jeb Bush.\par \par \uc2 BEFORE: Related to the above, The \uc2 RNC\uc2  secured a promise from Trump that\u160\'00\'A0he wouldn't run as a third-party candidate if he lost the GOP nomination.\par \par \uc2 AFTER: Trump changed his tune on this way too many times, occasionally flirtingwithdoingso ifthe partydidn'ttreat himfairly.\par \par \uc2 BEFORE: Trump said he would build a massive border wall that Mexico would pay for and deport every \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 AFTER: Trump said "everything's negotiable." He's done the same with several other issues, as our Janell Ross reported.\par \par \uc2 BEFORE: As secretary of state, \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  called President Obama's\u160\'00\'A0Trans-Pacific Partnership the "gold standard" of trade deals.\par \par \uc2 AFTER: She now opposes it, saying she had only "hoped" it would be the gold standard\u160\'00\'A0-- even as "hope" is not really what she said back then.\u160\'00\'A0"I did say, when I was secretary of state, three years ago, that I hoped it would be the gold standard. It was just finally negotiated last week, and in looking at it, it didn't meet my standards. My standards for more new, good jobs for Americans, for raising wages for Americans."\par \par \uc2 BEFORE:\u160\'00\'A0"So, the answer is, I'll release. Hopefully before the election, I'll release," he said. "And I'd like to release."\par \par \uc2 AFTER: Trump says the fact that his returns are being audited means he can't release them. It's not clear if he plans to do so at all.\par \par \uc2 BEFORE: Much like TPP, Clinton used to have a different position on gay marriage, criminal justice, illegal immigration and other issues.\par \par \uc2 AFTER: Clinton explained during an October debate. "Well, actually, I have been very consistent. Over the course of my entire life, I have always fought for the same values and principles, but, like most human beings \u8212\'20\'14 including those of us who run for office \u8212\'20\'14 I do absorb new information. I do look at what's happening in the world." As our own Chris Cillizza wrote, though, Clinton's changes in positions have almost always\u160\'00\'A0been politically expedient, and it's not clear what new information led her to embrace something like gay marriage -- after the vast majority of her party already had done so, we would note.\par \par \uc2 BEFORE: Rubio once\u160\'00\'A0called Trump a "con man." Paul Ryan said recently that\u160\'00\'A0Trump's questioning the impartiality of a judge of Mexican heritage presiding over the Trump University civil case was "racist."\par \par \uc2 AFTER: Despite these very strong criticisms, somehow \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  would apparently be worse than a "con man" or a candidate who says racist things.\u160\'00\'A0"If you can live with a Clinton presidency for 4 years thats your right," Rubio tweeted when his decision to back Trump was questioned. "I cant and will do what I can to prevent it."\u160\'00\'A0Said Ryan: "[Trump's judge comments are]\u160\'00\'A0absolutely unacceptable. But do I think \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  is the answer? No, I do not."\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020160622ec6m004bm\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 the-fix\par {\*\bkmkstart toc64}{\*\bkmkend toc64}\b \uc2 Why isn't the assassination attempt on Donald Trump bigger news? ; For one thing, the alleged would-be killer didn't come close.\b0\par\par\uc2 By Callum Borchers \par \uc2 1,059 \uc2 words\par \uc2 22 June 2016\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The No. 1 trending question related to Donald Trump on \uc2 Google\uc2  right now is "Who tried to shoot Trump?" Which means a lot of people don't know the answer. Which is probably because the assassination attempt on the presumptive Republican presidential nominee hasn't been covered as a major news story.\par \par \uc2 View the top-trending questions on \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  and Donald Trump in the past day {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://t.co/tzJdAjrWEv"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://t.co/tzJdAjrWEv}}}\uc2  pic.twitter.com/4sNQnubFkC\par \par \uc2 The answer, authorities say, is Michael Steven Sandford, a 20-year-old British citizen who was in the United States illegally after overstaying his visa. Sandford allegedly tried to pull a gun from the holster of a police officer at a Trump rally in Las Vegas on Saturday. He was arrested and later told the Secret Service that he had driven to the event from California and had been planning to kill the candidate for a year, according to a criminal complaint filed Monday in U.S. District Court in Nevada.\par \par \uc2 News outlets have certainly reported on the incident, but it hasn't gotten anything resembling wall-to-wall coverage. Cable news shows devoted little time to Sandford Tuesday morning and afternoon. Trump's dismal fundraising report from May and\u160\'00\'A0his\u160\'00\'A0recent firing of campaign manager \uc2 Corey Lewandowski\uc2  received far more attention. Trump called in to the Trump-friendly "Fox & Friends" morning show and wasn't even asked about the attempt on his life.\par \par \uc2 It's worth noting that the real estate magnate didn't bring it up, either. Trump\u160\'00\'A0hasn't so much as tweeted about it, which suggests he doesn't consider it a huge deal or doesn't want to talk about it.\par \par \uc2 The most obvious explanation is that Sandford doesn't appear to have come particularly close to completing his alleged mission. He didn't even succeed in arming himself at the Trump rally. Sandford's plot seems to have been feebly unsophisticated; he told authorities the extent of his training was a visit the day before the rally to a gun range, where he fired 20 rounds from a 9mm \uc2 Glock\uc2  pistol, a common service weapon, to learn how to use one.\par \par \uc2 In short, calling Sandford a legitimate threat might be giving him too much credit. A rough analogue might be Oscar Ramiro Ortega-Hernandez, who tried to kill President Obama in November 2011, but came nowhere close to doing so. Ortega-Hernandez got off shots\u160\'00\'A0\u8212\'20\'14 but fired aimlessly at the White House from 750 yards away \u8212\'20\'14 and hadn't done enough research to know the president was in San Diego at the time.\par \par \uc2 Other assassination attempts that failed by a long shot have received scant coverage, too. A previous, would-be Obama assassin, James McVay, also hatched a plot that involved swiping a police officer's gun. After\u160\'00\'A0stabbing a 75-year-old-woman to death in South Dakota and stealing her car, McVay drove to Wisconsin, where he planned to ambush a cop and take his firearm, according to statements he made to police after his arrest in July 2011. McVay said he planned to continue on through Chicago and Indianapolis and eventually kill the president on a golf range in Washington. But he was apprehended near Madison, Wis. CNN covered McVay's arrest and scheme, but some other national news outlets, including The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2  and \uc2 New York Times\uc2 , appear to have skipped the story altogether.\par \par \uc2 McVay was sentenced to death in 2014 for killing the South Dakota woman and hanged himself in his prison cell five months later.\par \par \uc2 From Trump's perspective, Sandford doesn't fit neatly into his campaign narrative. The billionaire has positioned himself as a staunch defender of the Second Amendment, so he certainly won't use the failed assassination attempt to push for gun control. Sandford is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 \u160\'00\'A0\u8212\'20\'14 and Trump is all about deporting illegal aliens\u160\'00\'A0\u8212\'20\'14 but the candidate's focus is on building a wall to keep out Mexicans and barring foreign Muslims from entering the United States. A Briton\u160\'00\'A0who overstayed his visa isn't a very good poster boy for the cause.\par \par \uc2 If Trump wanted to make this episode big news, he could do it. He's proven his ability to set the agenda over and over again. But he doesn't seem interested, and the media doesn't either. Indeed, to both sides, that could simply be because they don't want to give\u160\'00\'A0a poorly conceived assassination plot more attention\u160\'00\'A0than it's due.\par \par \uc2 But some on the right see a double-standard at play. The conservative news site \uc2 Hot Air\uc2  posed a hypothetical on Tuesday:\par \par \uc2 Can you imagine the coverage we'd be seeing if someone had attempted to shoot \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 ? The same could be said if it had happened with Barack Obama in the summer of 2008. Questions would be debated on air for weeks on end about the evil lurking in the hearts of men and why someone would be so desperate to prevent the election of the first black or female president. But when someone plots for more than a year to kill Trump, travels across the country to find an opportunity and then launches his attempt, it creates barely a ripple in the media pond.\par \par \uc2 Then there's this common sentiment from Trump supporters:\par \par \uc2 .@glennbeck and @BradThor inspired assassination attempt on Donald Trump: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://t.co/mkEuu8MAO7"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://t.co/mkEuu8MAO7}}}\par \par \uc2 @theblaze He must be a fan of @glennbeck, much like Byron Williams was. Remeber Byron Williams?{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://t.co/KXdwGYcj8e"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://t.co/KXdwGYcj8e}}}\par \par \uc2 Glenn Beck, a prominent conservative commentator who opposes Trump, was recently suspended for a week by SiriusXM after Brad Thor, who writes political thrillers, made comments\u160\'00\'A0on Beck's radio program that some listeners interpreted as a call for Trump to be assassinated.\par \par \uc2 "If Congress won't remove him from office, what patriot will step up and do that \u8212\'20\'14 if, if, he oversteps his mandate as president?" Thor said.\par \par \uc2 Thor and Beck both said later that the remark was not about assassinating\u160\'00\'A0Trump.\par \par \uc2 But for anyone already convinced that the media hates Trump, the coverage of Sandford's assassination attempt (or lack thereof) will probably only strengthen their belief.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020160621ec6l0058z\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 * Are you ready for some dishonest demagoguery? Of course you are:\par \par \uc2 In a smaller gathering earlier Tuesday with a few dozen people who arranged the event, Mr. Trump said, "We don't know anything about Hillary in terms of religion," according to video posted on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  by one of the organizers, Christian minister E.W. Jackson, the 2013 Republican nominee for lieutenant governor of Virginia. Mr. Jackson confirmed the video's authenticity in an interview with The Wall Street Journal.\par \par \uc2 For the record, there isn't "nothing out there" \u8212\'20\'14 \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  has talked about her religious faith many times. But what I find interesting is when he says "with Obama you had your guard up." Now why would that be? What is it about \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  that made it obvious to Trump that he was lying about his religious beliefs (not to mention his birth certificate), while he thinks it's less obvious with Clinton? I just can't quite put my finger on it. \u8230\'20\'26\par \par \uc2 * Lauren Fox reports that even though four gun-safety measures failed to pass the Senate this week, there's another one in the works:\par \par \uc2 A new, bipartisan proposal to keep guns out of the hands of suspected terrorists got a major boost Tuesday after Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) agreed to allow it to come to a vote on the Senate floor as early as this week.\par \par \uc2 Even though the only gun measure that could pass the current House is a declaration of National Buy Your Toddler a Glock Week, this still shows that things may be slowly changing.\par \par \uc2 * Chris Cillizza notes that it's been 200 days since Clinton held a press conference. And when reporters finally get one, they're going to make it extra-brutal.\par \par \uc2 * The Washington, D.C., Council passed a bill increasing the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2020.\par \par \uc2 * Matea Gold and Philip Rucker report that the response of people in the Republican Party to the abysmal state of the Trump campaign is somewhere between disgust and panic.\par \par \uc2 * Trump keeps repeating that "I can just spend my own money" because "I have a lot of cash." But doesn't saying so make it harder to raise money? After all, what's the point in donating to him if he's got so much money? But nothing, not even the success of this campaign, is more important to him than making sure everyone knows he's rich.\par \par \uc2 * Rep. Chaka Fattah (D-Pa.), who was defeated in a primary this year, was convicted on federal racketeering charges.\par \par \uc2 * Here's your tweet of the day:\par \par \uc2 I am "the king of debt."That has been great for me as a businessman, but is bad for the country. I made a fortune off of debt, will fix U.S.\par \par \uc2 Well I'm convinced.\par \par \uc2 * Kevin Drum notes that an apparently deranged \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  tried to kill \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  yesterday, and not only did it merit only passing mention in the news, Trump himself isn't even bothering to talk about it. Why? You'll never guess.\par \par \uc2 * Christopher Ingraham reports on a new survey showing that since Colorado legalized marijuana in 2012, pot smoking among teens hasn't gone up at all. Kids today!\par \par \uc2 * Dara Lind explains why Trump wasn't able to convince the \uc2 National Rifle Association\uc2  to move on keeping people on the terror watch list from buying guns.\par \par \uc2 * At the Week, I looked with skepticism at the reforms Bernie Sanders wants to bring to the Democratic Party's nominating process.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020160621ec6l006vc\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 the-fix\par {\*\bkmkstart toc66}{\*\bkmkend toc66}\b \uc2 History suggests Donald Trump's big, beautiful border wall may not be so outlandish ; Physically closing off the border is something Congress has endorsed before -- and could do again.\b0\par\par\uc2 By Amber Phillips \par \uc2 1,205 \uc2 words\par \uc2 9 June 2016\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 His plan has been called radical, ridiculous\u160\'00\'A0and "stupid" (that last bit of feedback comes from Mexico's president). One Texas Democrat recently suggested Donald Trump take his idea to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and shove it up his you-know-where.\par \par \uc2 But the idea of building a wall \u8212\'20\'14\u160\'00\'A0or at least some kind of barrier \u8212\'20\'14\u160\'00\'A0on the U.S.-Mexico border is hardly new. Over the past few decades, Congress has in fact\u160\'00\'A0authorized hundreds of miles of fencing along the border. True, it's not\u160\'00\'A0actual brick and mortar. But if Trump gets elected president and Congress stays controlled by Republicans, it's not hard to see how the political will is there for hundreds of miles of fence to turn into Trump's "great, great wall."\par \par \uc2 I caught up with Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration policy analyst at the \uc2 Cato Institute\uc2 , a libertarian think tank, to get a better sense of Congress's approach to border barriers, which has shifted over time from redirecting the flow of illegal immigration to trying to stop it completely. Here's a timeline of the big flash points:\par \par \uc2 1990: The first fence goes up\par \par \uc2 For decades, U.S. Border Patrol had been playing an endless game of cat and mouse on the vast, largely empty U.S.-Mexico border: They would catch immigrants crossing illegally, ship them back to the Mexican side of the border, and both sides would repeat.\par \par \uc2 In 1990, Border Patrol shifted its strategy from catching immigrants on the U.S. side to trying to stop them from crossing in the first place. And so the first wall was built.\par \par \uc2 Actually, it was a fence \u8212\'20\'14\u160\'00\'A0a 14-mile-long, about 10-feet-high fence along the San Diego border. There were barriers for vehicles, too, kind of like the guard rails you see along the highway.\par \par \uc2 "Outside of a port of entry, this was the first physical barrier" along our Mexican border, Nowrasteh said.\par \par \uc2 1996: Build more fences \u8212\'20\'14 but not for the reason you think\par \par \uc2 In 1996, Congress passed a law that gave the U.S. attorney general and Border Patrol the authority to build even more barriers along the border.\par \par \uc2 So up went more fences. But they were mostly congregated around higher population areas, such as San Diego and El Paso. That's because Border Patrol's immediate concern was to respond to complaints from U.S. residents about immigrants coming onto their private property. Texas's borderland in particular is about 95 percent privately owned.\par \par \uc2 "Residents were so upset about waking up and finding an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  sleeping on their yard," Nowrasteh said, "so to solve public complaints, they built a fence around El Paso and funneled these border-crossers elsewhere."\par \par \uc2 Put another way, this first series of border walls wasn't aimed at keeping all illegal immigrants out. It was aimed more at directing\u160\'00\'A0the flow of traffic away from population centers.\par \par \uc2 2005 and 2006: Build, baby, build\par \par \uc2 Illegal immigration from Mexico had been steadily climbing in the '90s, peaking in 2000 at 1.6 million per year, Nowrasteh said. But the 2005 to 2006 period was also a big year. More than\u160\'00\'A0a million people were apprehended on the border pretty much every year starting in 2004, in fact.\par \par \uc2 It's no coincidence that that was also when a Republican-controlled Congress, with a Republican in the White House, took its first big step toward fencing off the entire border.\par \par \uc2 In 2005, they passed a law that waived any legal barriers to putting up fences. If Border Patrol wanted to build a barrier that ran into conflict with, say, federal noise control or conservation laws, this new law said the fence took precedence.\par \par \uc2 The next year, Congress passed a bipartisan law requiring the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2  to build barriers on the border \u8212\'20\'14\u160\'00\'A0850 miles, in fact. Much of it was to be double-fenced, too. In the Senate, 26 Democrats voted for it, including New York's then-junior senator, \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 At that point, there were only a few dozen miles fenced off, so this new law marked\u160\'00\'A0a big shift in how Washington approached securing the border. The message from Congress was clear: Building a physical barrier was an acceptable and even desirable policy solution to illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 Public opinion at the time was split, with a 2006\u160\'00\'A0\uc2 CNN\uc2  poll showing 45 percent in favor of a 700-mile fence.\u160\'00\'A0Support rose to 54 percent in a 2010 \uc2 CNN\uc2  poll, though, and Republicans in particular began to demand action.\par \par \uc2 Even those who had been pragmatic when it came to immigration reform and giving illegal immigrants a way to stay in the United States felt the pressure to toe the line. "Complete the dang fence," \uc2 Sen. John McCain\uc2  (R-Ariz.) memorably said in a 2010 campaign ad, as he was facing a more conservative primary challenger.\par \par \uc2 2013: Lots of Border Patrol agents, but no fence\par \par \uc2 Up until this point, we've been talking\u160\'00\'A0about actual laws \u8212\'20\'14\u160\'00\'A0you know, bills passed by Congress and signed by the president. But to talk about today's relationship with the border, we have to\u160\'00\'A0reframe the discussion to plain old bills \u8212\'20\'14\u160\'00\'A0proposals that have been tried and mostly failed.\par \par \uc2 That's because Congress has tried and failed for several years now\u160\'00\'A0to pass immigration reform.\u160\'00\'A0The closest they got was in 2013, when a Democratic-controlled Senate voted to overhaul our immigration system.\u160\'00\'A0It didn't call for more fencing, but to appease Republicans who wanted to make sure the border was secure, it planned to send 20,000 more border agents.\par \par \uc2 Nowrasteh said over the years,\u160\'00\'A0talking about a fence or wall\u160\'00\'A0has been used interchangeably in American politics. But Trump's talk of a 30-, 40-, 60-foot wall with a door in it has forced us to make that distinction.\u160\'00\'A0And the polls have reflected that. While there has been\u160\'00\'A0substantial and even majority support for border fencing, a recent poll showed relatively little support for a massive border wall. Pew asked people earlier this year whether they supported walling off the entire U.S.-Mexico border, and just 34 percent were in favor.\par \par \uc2 The bill was never brought up in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives anyway.\par \par \uc2 2016: Trump's not the only one who wants a wall\par \par \uc2 Fast-forward to the 2016 presidential campaign. Nearly every single Republican presidential candidate talked about how the border needs to be secured before any other immigration laws can change. The senators running for president had long, winding debates about who was more adamant on border security.\par \par \uc2 As such, a majority of them also wanted a wall built.\par \par \uc2 The guy who said he'd build the biggest, bestest wall of them all, of course, came out on top. And it's not hard to see how, if he's elected president,\u160\'00\'A0this could become a real initiative for his administration \u8212\'20\'14\u160\'00\'A0even if it's not 55 feet high and built of bricks.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020160609ec69004h6\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 monkey-cage\par {\*\bkmkstart toc67}{\*\bkmkend toc67}\b \uc2 Americans aren't biased against Latino immigration. Here's what they actually fear. \b0\par\par\uc2 By Morris Levy;Matthew Wright \par \uc2 1,027 \uc2 words\par \uc2 9 June 2016\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Donald Trump's famous rants against Mexican migrants as drug smugglers, criminals and rapists, and his promise to build a wall keeping them out, have apparently helped him become the presumptive Republican nominee. Like other opponents of immigration reform, he insists that his views stem from principles of fairness to aspiring immigrants who "play by the rules" or concerns about national security. But his ability to rouse supporters by talking about immigration in explicitly ethnic terms suggests that many white Americans' opinions about immigration policy are motivated by unacknowledged prejudice against Latinos, as some research has suggested.\par \par \uc2 Our research finds that reality is more complex.\par \par \uc2 In a recent study, we tried to determine what is really behind many white Americans' support for "getting tough" on illegal immigration. Do they oppose offering legal status to illegal immigrants because they fundamentally dislike Latinos as a group and reject policy reforms that would benefit them? Or do they tend to stereotype illegal Latino immigrants as unassimilated or lacking skills they need to succeed in the United States, such as speaking English or holding a steady job \u8212\'20\'14 and oppose legalization because they are concerned about how it would affect the culture or the U.S. economy?\par \par \uc2 We tested this with a survey about immigration and "Juan," "Yuan" or "Johan."\par \par \uc2 In June 2015, we conducted an online survey of non-Hispanic white voters in California through the firm \uc2 Survey Sampling International\uc2 . Respondents were randomly assigned to one of several experimental groups. All the groups read a short vignette about a hypothetical legalization program, much like those that have been debated in the past few years.\par \par \uc2 Then, after reading the vignette, respondents were asked whether a particular \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  should be included in the legalization program. About one-third of respondents were asked about a Mexican immigrant named "Juan." Another third were asked about a Chinese immigrant named "Yuan." The rest were asked about a German immigrant named "Johan."\par \par \uc2 The experiment also included a second manipulation. All our respondents were told that the immigrant they read about had lived in the United States for two years. Half of them were also told that he speaks English and has worked steadily as a waiter.\par \par \uc2 If people opposed legalization because they dislike Latinos, we would expect respondents to favor the German and Chinese immigrants over the Mexican immigrant, regardless of his job status or language skills.\par \par \uc2 In fact, the additional information might even make anti-Latino bias worse. If people disliked Latinos, they might discount positive information and emphasize negative information about Juan, a well-known psychological process known as "motivated reasoning" \u8212\'20\'14 and would continue to favor offering legal status to Yuan and Johan but not Juan.\par \par \uc2 Anti-Latino bias disappeared once our hypothetical immigrant could speak English and hold a job\par \par \uc2 But the immigrant's work record and English fluency actually did make respondents as sympathetic to the Mexican immigrant as they were to the Chinese and German immigrant.\par \par \uc2 In the graph below, we show the percentage of respondents in each condition who said the immigrant they read about should be allowed into the legalization program.\par \par \uc2 When respondents learned nothing about the immigrant's language skills or job status, they were indeed biased against the Latino. Compared with\u160\'00\'A0respondents who read about Yuan (red line) or Johan (green line), those who read about Juan (blue line) were roughly seven to eight percentage points less likely to say he belonged in the legalization program.\par \par \uc2 But that gap disappeared when we told our respondents that Juan spoke English and had been working for two years. The anti-Latino bias simply evaporated\u160\'00\'A0leaving those supporting legalization for all three immigrants statistically indistinguishable \u8212\'20\'14 83 percent for Juan, compared with 81 percent for Yuan and 82 percent for Johan.\par \par \uc2 So why do so many white Americans oppose legalizing undocumented immigrants?\par \par \uc2 Discrimination against Latinos may grow not from hostility against an ethnic "outgroup," but rather stereotypes about whether they will contribute to the United States or\u160\'00\'A0become a burden. In the absence of other information, whites in our sample rely on ethnic cues to "fill in the blanks" \u8212\'20\'14 assuming undocumented Latinos are uneducated, unassimilated and potential financial problems for U.S.\u160\'00\'A0society.\par \par \uc2 Of course, this is one experiment. But research seems to support our interpretation.\u160\'00\'A0Comparable experiments that don't give any cues about skills, language and integration tend to find a lot of bias against Latinos. But studies that give clues about immigrants' education, employment, legal status and assimilation often find little or no anti-Latino bias. Other studies find similar beliefs that Latino immigrants are here illegally and tend to be less skilled than others.\par \par \uc2 What can immigration reformers learn from these results?\par \par \uc2 What does this mean for those who hope to build public support for comprehensive immigration reform\u160\'00\'A0\u8212\'20\'14 including a pathway to citizenship for the millions of immigrants illegally living in the United States?\par \par \uc2 On the one hand, negative racial imagery may anchor resistance, furnishing a ready-made portrait of "the bad immigrants" that opponents can activate at will.\par \par \uc2 On the other hand, polling repeatedly shows that most Americans and many Republicans \u8212\'20\'14 even some of the people supporting Trump \u8212\'20\'14 are open to legalization programs, if those programs were to include stringent enforcement and such conditions as paying a fine, passing an English test and showing a solid employment record.\par \par \uc2 In other words, whites are open to policies that address the negative group stereotypes \u8212\'20\'14 and ensure that new U.S. citizens could genuinely join and contribute to the community.\par \par \uc2 But immigration reform proponents must still deal with the fact that illegal immigration and Latino ethnicity are closely linked in Americans' minds. If the media were to cover Latinos in other contexts \u8212\'20\'14 not just in relation to immigration \u8212\'20\'14 the public might think less about immigration in ethnic categories, and therefore less likely to succumb to demagogues' ethnic scapegoating.\par \par \uc2 Morris Levy is an assistant professor of political science at the University of Southern California.\par \par \uc2 Matthew Wright is an assistant professor of government in American University's School of Public Affairs.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020160609ec69003ea\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved \par \par \uc2 Immigrant advocacy groups on Friday condemned reported plans by the Obama administration to launch a new series of raids against \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  families from Central America.\par \par \uc2 Such an effort, the groups said, would send panic through Latino communities, unfairly target victims of violence and poverty, and turn Latino voters against likely Democratic presidential nominee \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Officials at \uc2 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2 , while not confirming specific plans for new raids, said Friday that they must "enforce the law" and that their "current operations" and "enforcement priorities" will focus on deporting three kinds of illegal immigrants: convicted criminals, those who threaten public safety and "recent border crossers," including families.\par \par \uc2 In a statement, senior ICE spokeswoman Jennifer Elzea said that to promote border security, "our priorities include those apprehended crossing the border illegally after Jan. 1, 2014," including single adults and those with children. She said any operations would be limited to those who have been ordered deported and have no pending appeals or asylum claims, and that officials would avoid detaining people at schools, hospitals and churches.\par \par \uc2 The statement followed news reports this week that ICE was preparing to repeat a controversial program in which a series of raids last December and early January led to 121 women and children from Central America being detained in North Carolina, Georgia and other states. Some were immediately deported.The actions produced an outcry from immigrant groups and a number of liberal Democrats, including Clinton.\par \par \uc2 The new ICE plans appear to be in response to the continued flow of illegal families from Central America across the border. Between October and March, border patrol agents detained more than 32,000 families at the border, more than double the number for the same period the previous fiscal year. A surge of minors and families crossing the border began in 2013.\par \par \uc2 Advocates said the Obama administration was sending a callous and confusing signal to immigrant communities, approving policies that can send vulnerable women and children back to countries plagued by gangs and violent crime even as he proposes executive actions to shield those who have been here longer from deportation.\par \par \uc2 "The president is sending a message that he doesn't care about our community, and it is going to have a political price," \uc2 Gustavo Torres\uc2 , executive director of CASA of Maryland and Virginia, said Friday.\par \par \uc2 With Republican presidential candidate \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  vowing to build a wall across the Mexican border and deport all estimated 11 million illegal immigrants, Torres said, Latinos "are not going to vote for Trump, so what option do they have? They're going to stay home."\par \par \uc2 CASA and other groups in the Washington area, home to tens of thousands of immigrants and refugees from Central America, said they were preparing to help families who might be targeted in coming raids. CASA officials said they are setting up 24-hour hotlines, legal referrals and workshops about immigrants' rights.\par \par \uc2 Simon Sandoval Moschenberg, an immigration lawyer from the Center for Legal Justice in Falls Church, Va., predicted that the reports of possible raids would send "fear and panic" through Latino communities. After the raids early this year, he said, some undocumented parents kept their children home from school, and others lost their jobs.\par \par \uc2 "Our advice is to keep calm and don't panic," Sandoval Moschenberg said. He said the reported raids were aimed only at a "narrow slice" of the immigrant community and that the great majority of long-term illegal immigrants are "at no greater risk" than before.\par \par \uc2 Although ICE officials said no families would be targeted for raids if they had already filed appeals for relief or asylum, Torres and Sandoval Moschenberg pointed out that many Central American families could potentially qualify for deportation relief or political asylum because of the high levels of violence in their homelands.\par \par \uc2 Most of those who were able to obtain legal help after being arrested in the December-January raids received temporary deportation relief and are still in federal custody.\par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com \par \par \uc2 WP20160515iceraids0514\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020160515ec5f0002b\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved \par \par \uc2 Immigrant advocacy groups on Friday condemned reported plans by the Obama administration to launch a new series of raids against \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  families from Central America.\par \par \uc2 Such an effort, the groups said, would send panic through Latino communities, unfairly target victims of violence and poverty, and turn Latino voters against likely Democratic presidential nominee \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Officials at \uc2 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2 , while not confirming specific plans for new raids, said Friday that they must "enforce the law" and that their "current operations" and "enforcement priorities" will focus on deporting three kinds of illegal immigrants: convicted criminals, those who threaten public safety and "recent border crossers," including families.\par \par \uc2 In a statement, senior ICE spokeswoman Jennifer Elzea said that to promote border security, "our priorities include those apprehended crossing the border illegally after Jan. 1, 2014," including single adults and those with children. She said any operations would be limited to those who have been ordered deported and have no pending appeals or asylum claims, and that officials would avoid detaining people at schools, hospitals and churches.\par \par \uc2 The statement followed news reports this week that ICE was preparing to repeat a controversial program in which a series of raids last December and early January led to 121 women and children from Central America being detained in North Carolina, Georgia and other states. Some were immediately deported. The actions produced an outcry from immigrant groups and Democrats, including Clinton.\par \par \uc2 The new ICE plans appear to be in response to the continued flow of illegal families from Central America across the border. Between October and March, border patrol agents detained more than 32,000 families at the border, more than double the number for the same period the previous fiscal year. A surge of minors and families crossing the border began in 2013.\par \par \uc2 Advocates said the Obama administration was sending a callous and confusing signal to immigrant communities, approving policies that can send vulnerable women and children back to countries plagued by gangs and violent crime even as he proposes executive actions to shield those who have been here longer from deportation.\par \par \uc2 "The president is sending a message that he doesn't care about our community, and it is going to have a political price," \uc2 Gustavo Torres\uc2 , executive director of CASA of Maryland and Virginia, said Friday.\par \par \uc2 With Republican presidential candidate \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  vowing to build a wall across the Mexican border and deport all estimated 11 million illegal immigrants, Torres said, Latinos "are not going to vote for Trump, so what option do they have? They're going to stay home."\par \par \uc2 CASA and other groups in the Washington area, home to tens of thousands of immigrants and refugees from Central America, said they were preparing to help families who might be targeted in coming raids. CASA officials said they are setting up 24-hour hotlines, legal referrals and workshops about immigrants' rights.\par \par \uc2 Simon Sandoval Moschenberg, an immigration lawyer from the Center for Legal Justice in Falls Church, Va., predicted that the reports of possible raids would send "fear and panic" through Latino communities. After the raids early this year, he said, some undocumented parents kept their children home from school, and others lost their jobs.\par \par \uc2 "Our advice is to keep calm and don't panic," Sandoval Moschenberg said. He said the reported raids were aimed only at a "narrow slice" of the immigrant community and that the great majority of long-term illegal immigrants are "at no greater risk" than before.\par \par \uc2 Although ICE officials said no families would be targeted for raids if they had already filed appeals for relief or asylum, Torres and Sandoval Moschenberg pointed out that many Central American families could potentially qualify for deportation relief or political asylum because of the high levels of violence in their homelands.\par \par \uc2 Most of those who were able to obtain legal help after being arrested in the December-January raids received temporary deportation relief and are still in federal custody.\par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com \par \par \uc2 WP20160514iceraids0514\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020160514ec5e00010\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Immigrant advocacy groups on Friday condemned reported plans by the Obama administration to launch a new series of raids against \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  families from Central America.\par \par \uc2 Such an effort, the groups said, would send panic through Latino communities, unfairly target victims of violence and poverty, and turn Latino voters against likely Democratic presidential nominee \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Officials at \uc2 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2 , while not confirming specific plans for new raids, said Friday that they must "enforce the law" and that their "current operations" and "enforcement priorities" will focus on deporting three kinds of illegal immigrants: convicted criminals, those who threaten public safety and "recent border crossers," including families.\par \par \uc2 In a statement, senior ICE spokeswoman Jennifer Elzea said that to promote border security, "our priorities include those apprehended crossing the border illegally after Jan. 1, 2014," including single adults and those with children. She said any operations would be limited to those who have been ordered deported and have no pending appeals or asylum claims, and that officials would avoid detaining people at schools, hospitals and churches.\par \par \uc2 The statement followed news reports this week that ICE was preparing to repeat a controversial program in which a series of raids last December and early January led to 121 women and children from Central America being detained in North Carolina, Georgia and other states. Some were immediately deported. The actions produced an outcry from immigrant groups and a number of Democrats, including Clinton.\par \par \uc2 The new ICE plans appear to be in response to the continued flow of illegal families from Central America across the border. Between October and March, border patrol agents detained more than 32,000 families at the border, more than double the number for the same period the previous fiscal year. A surge of minors and families crossing the border began in 2013.\par \par \uc2 Advocates said the Obama administration was sending a callous and confusing signal to immigrant communities, approving policies that can send vulnerable women and children back to countries plagued by gangs and violent crime even as he proposes executive actions to shield those who have been here longer from deportation.\par \par \uc2 "The president is sending a message that he doesn't care about our community, and it is going to have a political price," \uc2 Gustavo Torres\uc2 , executive director of CASA of Maryland and Virginia, said Friday.\par \par \uc2 With Republican presidential candidate \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  vowing to build a wall across the Mexican border and deport all estimated 11\u160\'00\'A0million illegal immigrants, Torres said, Latinos "are not going to vote for Trump, so what option do they have? They're going to stay home."\par \par \uc2 CASA and other groups in the Washington area, home to tens of thousands of immigrants and refugees from Central America, said they were preparing to help families who might be targeted in coming raids. CASA officials said they are setting up 24-hour hotlines, legal referrals and workshops about immigrants' rights.\par \par \uc2 Simon Sandoval Moschenberg, an immigration lawyer from the Center for Legal Justice in Falls Church, Va., predicted that the reports of possible raids would send "fear and panic" through Latino communities. After the raids early this year, he said, some undocumented parents kept their children home from school, and others lost their jobs.\par \par \uc2 "Our advice is to keep calm and don't panic," Sandoval Moschenberg said. He said the reported raids were aimed only at a "narrow slice" of the immigrant community and that the great majority of long-term illegal immigrants are "at no greater risk" than before.\par \par \uc2 Although ICE officials said no families would be targeted for raids if they had already filed appeals for relief or asylum, Torres and Sandoval Moschenberg pointed out that many Central American families could potentially qualify for deportation relief or political asylum because of the high levels of violence in their homelands.\par \par \uc2 Most of those who were able to obtain legal help after being arrested in the December-January raids received temporary deportation relief and are still in federal custody.\par \par \uc2 pamela.constable@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020160513ec5d00697\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

Hsu \par \uc2 1,568 \uc2 words\par \uc2 11 May 2016\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The Justice Department announced Tuesday that it will not seek the death penalty against Ahmed Abu Khattala, 54, a U.S.-designated terrorist whom prosecutors accuse of leading the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya, that killed four Americans.\par \par \uc2 The announcement, contained in a notice to the federal trial court in Washington, clears the way for a major terrorism trial in the nation's capital, the first in the United States since 2015, barring a plea agreement by Abu Khattala.\par \par \uc2 The decision ended a lengthy review after President Obama aired concerns in October that while he supported capital punishment in theory, he found it "deeply troubling" in practice.\par \par \uc2 The move marked somewhat of a shift for the Justice Department, one year after federal prosecutors last May secured a death sentence in a capital terrorism case against Dzhokhar Tsarnaev for the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings.\par \par \uc2 The department in November approved its first new capital prosecution under Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch \u8212\'20\'14 who called the death penalty an "effective punishment" before her Senate confirmation in April 2015 \u8212\'20\'14 against Noe Aranda-Soto, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  accused of human trafficking and murder in Texas.\par \par \uc2 However, analysts said the government faced a difficult calculation in the Benghazi case, pointing to complex legal, political and national security concerns that have produced a mixed record in capital terrorism cases, and to a history in which no D.C. jury has ever imposed the death penalty.\par \par \uc2 "We do these on a case-by-case basis," a Justice Department official said, declining to elaborate. Legal observers noted challenges facing the \uc2 U.S. government\uc2  in bringing witnesses from Libya to testify in a U.S. courtroom amid sectarian conflict in the region.\par \par \uc2 A trial date before U.S. District Judge Christopher R. Cooper of the District has not been set.\par \par \uc2 Abu Khattala commanded a brigade absorbed by the extremist anti-Western group Ansar al-Sharia, which carried out the attacks on Sept. 11 and 12, 2012, that killed U.S. Ambassador J.\u160\'00\'A0Christopher Stevens and three others, according to U.S. investigators. The \uc2 U.S. government\uc2  in January 2014 designated Abu Khattala a terrorist and Ansar al-Sharia, an armed militia that seeks to establish sharia law in Libya, a terrorist organization.\par \par \uc2 "The department is committed to ensuring that the defendant is held accountable for his alleged role in the terrorist attack on the U.S. Special Mission and annex in Benghazi that killed four Americans and seriously injured two others, and if convicted, he faces a sentence of up to life in prison," Justice Department spokeswoman Emily Pierce said in a statement Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 The Obama administration authorized Abu Khattala's capture in a June 2014 U.S. Special Operations raid in Libya after he was lured to a villa south of Benghazi.\par \par \uc2 He pleaded not guilty after being indicted on 18 counts, including death-eligible charges of murder of an internationally protected person, murder of an officer or employee of the United States, killing a person in an attack on a U.S. facility and providing material support to terrorists resulting in death.\par \par \uc2 In unsealing a July 2013 complaint with death-penalty-eligible charges, then-Attorney General \uc2 Eric H. Holder Jr\uc2 . said that an investigation was ongoing and that the arrest "proves that the \uc2 U.S. government\uc2  will expend any effort necessary to pursue terrorists who harm our citizens."\par \par \uc2 A spokesman for Channing D. Phillips, U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, referred questions about the decision by the attorney general's office to the Justice Department.\par \par \uc2 A.J. Kramer, federal public defender for D.C., declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 The decision returned focus at least briefly to the criminal prosecution for an attack that remains politically charged \u8212\'20\'14 raised in Republican presidential debates and dramatized in a feature film released nationwide early this year.\par \par \uc2 Democratic presidential candidate \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 , testifying in October before a House select committee investigating the attacks, repeated her categorical denials of the long-debunked charge that she impeded rescue attempts. However, a State Department review concluded that security was inadequate for Benghazi, and the issue has continued to spur partisan crossfire.\par \par \uc2 In the Abu Khattala case, it remains unclear what impact a decision not to seek the death penalty might have on plea talks, even as national security concerns surrounding the prosecution persist.\par \par \uc2 The situation is not unusual. The government's record in capital terrorism cases has been mixed, with more success in cases brought against "lone wolves" acting on their own to kill on U.S. soil than in cases brought against foreign-based or foreign-trained fighters.\par \par \uc2 Libya is in the midst of a civil war, complicating the investigation and raising questions about how much prosecutors will rely on classified evidence and on how any such disclosures might affect U.S. interests in the region.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors have already turned over about 20,000 pages of material to Abu Khattala's defense at last notice, most of it is classified, and much of the government's case remains secret.\par \par \uc2 The Libyan government has previously protested the U.S. seizure of Abu Khattala as a violation of Libyan sovereignty.\par \par \uc2 In court papers, U.S. authorities alleged that Abu Khattala told others he believed the American diplomatic presence in Benghazi was cover for a U.S. intelligence-gathering facility and vowed to "do something about this facility."\par \par \uc2 Abu Khattala drove with attackers to the U.S. diplomatic post and participated in the assault that began about 9:45 p.m. that night, "coordinating the efforts of his conspirators and turning away emergency responders," prosecutors alleged. Stevens and State Department communications expert Sean Patrick Smith died of smoke inhalation after attackers set ablaze a villa containing a "safe room" at the compound.\par \par \uc2 Near midnight, Abu Khattala allegedly entered a mission office and oversaw the looting of data about a nearby CIA annex that soon came under mortar fire, killing security contractors Tyrone S. Woods and Glen Doherty.\par \par \uc2 Last year, a lawyer for Abu Khattala, standing next to the defendant, \u160\'00\'A0said in court that "everyone agrees what happened in September 2012 was a tragedy and Americans suffered a tragic loss." Defense attorney Jeffrey D. Robinson added, "Mr. Abu Khattala agrees it was a tragic loss but disagrees he is the person responsible for it."\par \par \uc2 Death-penalty experts said they were not surprised at the government's move, noting that terrorism prosecutions for the deaths of Americans remain extremely rare and highly case-specific.\par \par \uc2 Federal prosecutors have sought the death penalty for an accused terrorist at least 14 times since 1993, but only one was executed \u8212\'20\'14 Timothy Mc\u173\'00\'ADVeigh, the 1995 Oklahoma City federal-building bomber.\par \par \uc2 McVeigh is one of three people executed by the \uc2 U.S. government\uc2  since 1964.\par \par \uc2 Tsarnaev, the most recent addition to federal death row, also is a U.S. citizen, of Chechen heritage, who purportedly was inspired by Islamist radicalism but not in contact with any organized group.\par \par \uc2 Others who faced the death penalty but pleaded guilty and received life sentences include serial bomber Eric Rudolph, an avowed white supremacist convicted in 2005 for explosions at Atlanta's Olympic Park in 1996 and at an Alabama abortion clinic, and Theodore Kaczynski, the Unabomber, who was convicted in 1998 of leading an 18-year-long anti-technology and anarchist crusade from his remote Montana cabin that killed three and injured 28.\par \par \uc2 Since 2000, the \uc2 U.S. government\uc2  has failed to persuade federal juries to impose the death penalty in other high-profile cases.\par \par \uc2 A jury in Alexandria, Va., in 2006 rejected the \uc2 U.S. government\uc2 's four-year effort to obtain a death sentence against al-Qaeda conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui, a French citizen who received life in prison for conspiring in the 2001 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.\par \par \uc2 Manhattan jurors in 2001 deadlocked in the al-Qaeda-led bombings of two U.S. embassies in East Africa in 1998 that killed 214 people, resulting in life sentences for a Saudi and a Tanzanian man convicted in the attacks.\par \par \uc2 The Moussaoui prosecution in particular was criticized by some analysts from both the left and right. Conservative critics said the result highlighted the drawbacks of trying terrorists in civilian courts. Liberal experts said the government wasted years and millions of dollars seeking Moussaoui's execution when a plea deal and life sentence was an option from the outset.\par \par \uc2 Other observers questioned whether U.S. pursuit of the death penalty helps or hinders foreign-government cooperation with U.S. counterterrorism efforts.\par \par \uc2 "There are tensions between public trials and national security," said Robert Dunham, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, including what kinds of evidence can be admitted in a capital case and the need not to compromise anti-terrorism efforts abroad. "This is a highly extraordinary case."\par \par \uc2 The prospect of a death-penalty trial in Washington poses hurdles for both sides.\par \par \uc2 Trying a foreign terrorist accused of the overseas killing of a senior U.S. diplomat and other federal employees could be expected to draw a sympathetic jury in Washington, seat of the national government.\par \par \uc2 However, since Congress reinstated the federal death penalty in 1988, only a handful of eligible cases have gone to federal trial in the District, and none resulted in a death sentence.\par \par \uc2 spencer.hsu@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020160510ec5a006v9\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

Hsu \par \uc2 865 \uc2 words\par \uc2 11 May 2016\par \uc2 The Washington Post\par \uc2 WP\par \uc2 FINAL\par A03\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved \par \par \uc2 The Justice Department announced Tuesday that it will not seek the death penalty against Ahmed Abu Khattala, 54, a U.S.-designated terrorist whom prosecutors accuse of leading the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya, that killed four Americans.\par \par \uc2 The announcement, contained in a notice to the federal trial court in Washington, clears the way for a major terrorism trial in the nation's capital, the first in the United States since 2015, barring a plea agreement by Abu Khattala.\par \par \uc2 The decision ended a lengthy review after President Obama aired concerns in October that while he supported capital punishment in theory, he found it "deeply troubling" in practice.\par \par \uc2 The move marked somewhat of a shift for the Justice Department, one year after federal prosecutors last May secured a death sentence in a capital terrorism case against Dzhokhar Tsarnaev for the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings.\par \par \uc2 The department in November approved its first new capital prosecution under Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch - who called the death penalty an "effective punishment" before her Senate confirmation in April 2015 - against Noe Aranda-Soto, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  accused of human trafficking and murder in Texas.\par \par \uc2 However, analysts said the government faced a difficult calculation in the Benghazi case, pointing to complex legal, political and national security concerns that have produced a mixed record in capital terrorism cases, and to a history in which no D.C. jury has ever imposed the death penalty.\par \par \uc2 "We do these on a case-by-case basis," a Justice Department official said, declining to elaborate. Legal observers noted challenges facing the \uc2 U.S. government\uc2  in bringing witnesses from Libya to testify in a U.S. courtroom amid sectarian conflict in the region.\par \par \uc2 A trial date before U.S. District Judge Christopher R. Cooper of the District has not been set.\par \par \uc2 Abu Khattala commanded a brigade absorbed by the extremist anti-Western group Ansar al-Sharia, which carried out the attacks on Sept. 11 and 12, 2012, that killed U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three others, according to U.S. investigators. The \uc2 U.S. government\uc2  in January 2014 designated Abu Khattala a terrorist and Ansar al-Sharia, an armed militia that seeks to establish sharia law in Libya, a terrorist organization.\par \par \uc2 "The department is committed to ensuring that the defendant is held accountable for his alleged role in the terrorist attack on the U.S. Special Mission and annex in Benghazi that killed four Americans and seriously injured two others, and if convicted, he faces a sentence of up to life in prison," Justice Department spokeswoman Emily Pierce said in a statement Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 The Obama administration authorized Abu Khattala's capture in a June 2014 U.S. Special Operations raid in Libya after he was lured to a villa south of Benghazi.\par \par \uc2 He pleaded not guilty after being indicted on 18 counts, including death-eligible charges of murder of an internationally protected person, murder of an officer or employee of the United States, killing a person in an attack on a U.S. facility and providing material support to terrorists resulting in death.\par \par \uc2 In unsealing a July 2013 complaint with death-penalty-eligible charges, then-Attorney General \uc2 Eric H. Holder Jr\uc2 . said that an investigation was ongoing and that the arrest "proves that the \uc2 U.S. government\uc2  will expend any effort necessary to pursue terrorists who harm our citizens."\par \par \uc2 A spokesman for Channing D. Phillips, U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, referred questions about the decision by the attorney general's office to the Justice Department.\par \par \uc2 A.J. Kramer, federal public defender for D.C., declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 The decision returned focus at least briefly to the criminal prosecution for an attack that remains politically charged - raised in Republican presidential debates and dramatized in a feature film released nationwide early this year.\par \par \uc2 Democratic presidential candidate \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 , testifying in October before a House select committee investigating the attacks, repeated her categorical denials of the long-debunked charge that she impeded rescue attempts. However, a State Department review concluded that security was inadequate for Benghazi, and the issue has continued to spur partisan crossfire.\par \par \uc2 In the Abu Khattala case, it remains unclear what impact a decision not to seek the death penalty might have on plea talks, even as national security concerns surrounding the prosecution persist.\par \par \uc2 The situation is not unusual. The government's record in capital terrorism cases has been mixed, with more success in cases brought against "lone wolves" acting on their own to kill on U.S. soil than in cases brought against foreign-based or foreign-trained fighters.\par \par \uc2 Libya is in the midst of a civil war, complicating the investigation and raising questions about how much prosecutors will rely on classified evidence and on how any such disclosures might affect U.S. interests in the region.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors have already turned over about 20,000 pages of material to Abu Khattala's defense at last notice, most of it is classified, and much of the government's case remains secret.\par \par \uc2 The Libyan government has previously protested the U.S. seizure of Abu Khattala as a violation of Libyan sovereignty.\par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com\par \par \uc2 WP20160511khattala0511\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020160511ec5b0002g\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved \par \par \uc2 Nebraska will allow thousands of immigrants brought to the United States illegally as children to work in at least 170 professions that require state licenses, including health care and education, after lawmakers overrode conservative Republican \uc2 Gov. Pete Ricketts\uc2 's veto of the measure Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 Senators took the vote on the last day of their legislative session, five days after Ricketts called the measure unfair to immigrants who follow the legal pathway to citizenship. Young immigrants and other supporters erupted in applause from the gallery of the chamber after the 31-to-13 vote.\par \par \uc2 The law applies to immigrants who received lawful status under President Obama's executive action in 2012 that allowed them to stay. Nebraska had nearly 5,200 youths who qualified as of December, according to the latest data from \uc2 U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Supporters touted the Nebraska plan as a way to fill jobs in a state with an unemployment rate of only 3 percent and a skilled-worker shortage in fields such as manufacturing and nursing. Ricketts referred to the proposal as an "amnesty bill" and tried to pressure lawmakers with news conferences, open letters and personal phone calls.\par \par \uc2 A nearly half-mile-long tunnel leading from Mexico to San Diego was discovered and more than a ton of cocaine and seven tons of marijuana were seized, the U.S. attorney's office said Wednesday. Six people were arrested.\par \par \uc2 The tunnel extends 300 yards from a house in Tijuana, Mexico, to the border and then 500 yards on the U.S. side to a fenced lot in a San Diego industrial area.\par \par \uc2 The tunnel was equipped with a rail system, ventilation, lights and a large elevator, officials said. The exit on the U.S. side is about three feet wide and was covered by a trash bin.\par \par \uc2 The six people arrested in San Diego on Friday were charged with crimes involving drugs and construction of the tunnel.\par \par \uc2 Dozens of tunnels have been found along the U.S.-Mexico border in recent years, some equipped with hydraulic lifts and electric rail cars. Most of the tunnels found were in California and Arizona.\par \par \uc2 Shooting leads to emergency on university campus: \uc2 Washington University in St. Louis\uc2  declared a safety emergency for students, faculty and staff after a shooting that injured at least one person on its main campus. The emergency was lifted just before 3 p.m., two hours after the shooting. A spokeswoman said that the shooting occurred near the school's student union and performing-arts building and that the victim was expected to survive.\par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com\par \par \uc2 WP20160421domestic0421\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020160421ec4l0000f\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National-Politics\par {\*\bkmkstart toc74}{\*\bkmkend toc74}\b \uc2 Legal decision could resonate most in immigration epicenter of Los Angeles\b0\par\par\uc2 By Robert Barnes   \par \uc2 1,740 \uc2 words\par \uc2 18 April 2016\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 LOS ANGELES \u8212\'20\'14 There is no place in the country that will be more affected by the Supreme Court battle over President Obama's plan to shield millions of undocumented immigrants from deportation than sprawling Los Angeles County.\par \par \uc2 There are an estimated 1\u160\'00\'A0million undocumented people here, about 400,000 of whom could be eligible for the protected status that Obama says would bring them "out of the shadows."\par \par \uc2 County officials plan an aggressive program to sign them up should the justices give the green light. Arguments in the case are scheduled for Monday.\par \par \uc2 "I'm looking at the return the county gets," said Hilda L. Solis, Obama's former labor secretary who is now chair of the powerful Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. "Do I want them to pay taxes? Absolutely. Do I want them to be established, with some form of identification? Yes. I think we're all better off, we're safer."\par \par \uc2 It is a familiar view from a Democratic politician in the state with the country's largest concentration of immigrants.\par \par \uc2 But the state with the second-largest concentration \u8212\'20\'14 Texas \u8212\'20\'14 is leading the fight against what it and 25 other states say would saddle them with the cost of providing benefits for millions of people newly eligible for work permits and government programs. The crux of the states' legal argument is that the program, regardless of its merits, represents an unlawful power grab by the president.\par \par \uc2 "It is not whether this is the right solution or not," said Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R), whose efforts have led lower courts to block the plan from being implemented. "It's whether the president is acting outside his constitutional authority."\par \par \uc2 It is true that justices will concentrate on whether Obama overstepped his authority and ignored legal procedures in November 2014 when he announced the immigration changes that Congress refused to enact. And the court also will consider whether Texas and the other states have the legal standing to interfere in immigration policy that the White House insists belongs to the executive.\par \par \uc2 But the societal impact of immigration is debated in the court filings. And there is a stark partisan and ideological divide in the case that \uc2 Daniel Stein\uc2 , president of the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), calls "\uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  huge."\par \par \uc2 It is impossible to ignore the political backdrop as well.\par \par \uc2 The case arrives during a presidential election year in which Trump promises a wall along the border to keep immigrants out and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) is adamant that he would immediately reverse Obama's plans should the court uphold them. On the Democratic side, both candidates have taken positions on immigration to the left of the president.\par \par \uc2 From California, a broad coalition of educators, religious leaders, business executives, politicians and police has coalesced around a message that it is time for a cease-fire.\par \par \uc2 "In the last half-century, California has attracted more immigrants \u8212\'20\'14 and done more to grapple with immigration policy \u8212\'20\'14 than any other state," said one brief that contends that Obama's plan would result in "stronger, safer, and more prosperous communities."\par \par \uc2 It added, in a mellow tone, "The identity of a thriving city or state depends on the sense of community shared by its inhabitants and those inhabitants in turn draw their dignity and their identities from the social and religious communities they build."\par \par \uc2 It is a far different statement from the one California voters made in 1994, when they overwhelmingly passed Proposition\u160\'00\'A0187. It withheld from illegal immigrants public education, all manner of state services and non-emergency health care. The proposal was ruled unconstitutional.\par \par \uc2 A generation later, the state has gone through "all that bumpy stuff that the rest of the country is experiencing now," said Manuel Pastor, executive director of the University of Southern California's Center for the Study of Immigrant Integration.\par \par \uc2 "We understand that undocumented folks are now part of the state's fabric," Pastor said. "One of six people you touch in the labor force is not here legally. I mean, my God, that's how Southern California functions."\par \par \uc2 Obama said it was a recognition of that reality that led him to announce the deportation "guidance" after House Republicans blocked an effort to pass a comprehensive immigration bill.\par \par \uc2 The plan is called Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA). It would allow illegal immigrants in those categories to remain in the country and apply for work permits if they have been here for at least five years and have not committed felonies or repeated misdemeanors.\par \par \uc2 More than 4\u160\'00\'A0million immigrants could qualify for the program and a simultaneously announced expansion of an earlier program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), which affects those who were brought to this country as children.\par \par \uc2 The Obama administration says it is doing nothing more than setting priorities about whom to deport. As a practical matter, it argues, Congress has given the administration only enough money to deport annually no more than about 400,000 of the nation's estimated 11\u160\'00\'A0million illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 The money should be used to find and deport those with criminal violations, the administration says, rather than immigrants who have established a life here and "anchor families" that would be torn apart by deportation.\par \par \uc2 But a federal district judge in Texas and then an appeals court ruled 2-to-1 that the plan "is much more than nonenforcement: It would affirmatively confer 'lawful presence' and associated benefits on a class of unlawfully present aliens."\par \par \uc2 The ruling was welcomed by Texas officials. But it is Obama's message that resonates in California, where immigrants have become a powerful political force, even if many of them cannot vote. In Los Angeles County, for instance, home to more people than the entire state of Michigan, more than two-thirds of those younger than 18 have at least one parent who is an immigrant.\par \par \uc2 "There are lots of immigrants who can vote who are sympathetic to the plight of the undocumented," Pastor said. Moreover, he said, there is a recognition of how integrated the communities have become.\par \par \uc2 "Forty percent of the people aged 25 to 64 who have a PhD in the state of California are immigrants," he said. "And those high-skilled immigrants \u8212\'20\'14 for instance, in Silicon Valley \u8212\'20\'14 are often coupled with unskilled undocumented immigrants, because who takes care of their children? Who prepares their food? Who mows their lawns?"\par \par \uc2 A USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll published last month showed that nearly two-thirds of Californians think illegal immigration is a major problem in the state; 9 in 10 Republicans think it is either a "crisis" or major problem.\par \par \uc2 But more than three-fourths of voters said immigrants already here should be allowed to stay, and 60\u160\'00\'A0percent said they should be allowed to apply for citizenship \u8212\'20\'14 something DAPA does not contemplate.\par \par \uc2 Even among Republicans, only 36\u160\'00\'A0percent said immigrants should be required to leave, the poll indicated.\par \par \uc2 The political impact in a state where Democrats rule has been striking. The place that in the 1990s would have denied state benefits to any \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  just extended health-care coverage to the undocumented population 19 and younger. This was a compromise from a proposal to extend it to all.\par \par \uc2 Robin Hvidston, executive director of a group called We the People Rising, said her organization testified against the plan but lacks much support in the California legislature.\par \par \uc2 "We feel like we don't have a voice in Sacramento," she said. "We look with more hope to Congress."\par \par \uc2 Solis, whose district of more than 2\u160\'00\'A0million residents is more than 50\u160\'00\'A0percent Latino, said the political climate has changed as the undocumented community has become more established. More than half of those in the county have been there more than 10\u160\'00\'A0years.\par \par \uc2 "There's more of a tolerance because there are so many people now who can say, 'I know somebody who's in that situation,'\u8201\'20\'09" she said in an interview in her office. "There are probably some people in this building who are in that situation. I'm pretty sure of it."\par \par \uc2 She also credits a younger generation that has taken advantage of DACA and changes that allow them to pay in-state college tuition.\par \par \uc2 "They paid for their own education because they didn't qualify for federal or even state aid at the time," Solis said. "Why would you want to deport those kids? These are going to be the people who replace me or replace you, the bankers, the lawyers."\par \par \uc2 She might have been talking about Anabel Cuevas. Her father, Eugenio, came from Mexico in 1989, followed by Anabel and her mother, Victoria, a year later.\par \par \uc2 Anabel Cuevas grew up in Pasadena and said she did not know she was undocumented until applying for college. She found that she could not accept the scholarship she was offered at a private college because she was not a citizen.\par \par \uc2 "My parents were always hard workers so we were always, I guess you could say, moving one step up, to a better apartment or whatever," she said. Her mother has worked as a babysitter and housekeeper; her father is an independent construction contractor, specializing in tile and stone.\par \par \uc2 When the private college fell through, Anabel Cuevas went to \uc2 California State University at Northridge\uc2 . It cost her father about $70,000, he said.\par \par \uc2 She was able to get a work permit through DACA and now writes computer code for a high-tech company. And hers is one of the many "mixed" families in the county: She has the work permit, her parents are undocumented, and her younger brother, born here, is a citizen.\par \par \uc2 So the Cuevases would qualify. But nothing is certain. The DAPA program may not survive the court challenge. If it does, it could still be revoked. And the deferral from deportation under DAPA is only temporary.\par \par \uc2 But she said it is worth speaking out and being identified. She feels there is little danger of being deported in L.A. County.\par \par \uc2 "But we're so close as a family, I've told [her parents], 'If you guys get deported, I'm coming with you, and we'll start a business somewhere else,'\u8201\'20\'09" she said. "My experience as an immigrant is that nothing is guaranteed."\par \par \uc2 robert.barnes@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020160417ec4g0025t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 A-Section\par {\*\bkmkstart toc75}{\*\bkmkend toc75}\b \uc2 The ground zero for immigration ruling\b0\par\par\uc2 Robert Barnes \par \uc2 1,734 \uc2 words\par \uc2 18 April 2016\par \uc2 The Washington Post\par \uc2 WP\par \uc2 FINAL\par A01\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved \par \par \uc2 LOS ANGELES - There is no place in the country that will be more affected by the Supreme Court battle over President Obama's plan to shield millions of undocumented immigrants from deportation than sprawling Los Angeles County.\par \par \uc2 There are an estimated 1 million undocumented people here, about 400,000 of whom could be eligible for the protected status that Obama says would bring them "out of the shadows."\par \par \uc2 County officials plan an aggressive program to sign them up should the justices give the green light. Arguments in the case are scheduled for Monday.\par \par \uc2 "I'm looking at the return the county gets," said Hilda L. Solis, who was Obama's labor secretary and is now chair of the powerful Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. "Do I want them to pay taxes? Absolutely. Do I want them to be established, with some form of identification? Yes. I think we're all better off, we're safer."\par \par \uc2 It is a familiar view from a Democratic politician in the state with the country's largest concentration of immigrants.\par \par \uc2 But the state with the second-largest concentration - Texas - is leading the fight against what it and 25 other states say would saddle them with the cost of providing benefits for millions of people newly eligible for work permits and government programs. The crux of the states' legal argument is that the program, regardless of its merits, represents an unlawful power grab by the president.\par \par \uc2 "It is not whether this is the right solution or not," said Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R), whose efforts have led lower courts to block the plan from being implemented. "It's whether the president is acting outside his constitutional authority."\par \par \uc2 It is true that the justices will concentrate on whether Obama overstepped his authority and ignored legal procedures in November 2014 when he announced the immigration changes that Congress refused to enact. And the court also will consider whether Texas and the other states have the legal standing to interfere in immigration policy that the White House insists belongs to the executive.\par \par \uc2 But the societal impact of immigration is debated in the court filings. And there is a stark partisan and ideological divide in the case that \uc2 Daniel Stein\uc2 , president of the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), calls "\uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  huge."\par \par \uc2 It is impossible to ignore the political backdrop as well.\par \par \uc2 The case arrives during a presidential election year in which Trump promises a wall along the border to keep immigrants out and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) is adamant that he would immediately reverse Obama's plans should the court uphold them. On the Democratic side, both candidates have taken positions on immigration to the left of the president.\par \par \uc2 From California, a broad coalition of educators, religious leaders, business executives, politicians and police has coalesced around a message that it is time for a cease-fire.\par \par \uc2 "In the last half-century, California has attracted more immigrants - and done more to grapple with immigration policy - than any other state," said one brief that contends that Obama's plan would result in "stronger, safer, and more prosperous communities."\par \par \uc2 It added, in a mellow tone, "The identity of a thriving city or state depends on the sense of community shared by its inhabitants and those inhabitants in turn draw their dignity and their identities from the social and religious communities they build."\par \par \uc2 It is a far different statement from the one California voters made in 1994, when they overwhelmingly passed Proposition 187. It withheld from illegal immigrants public education, all manner of state services and non-emergency health care. The proposal was ruled unconstitutional.\par \par \uc2 A generation later, the state has gone through "all that bumpy stuff that the rest of the country is experiencing now," said Manuel Pastor, executive director of the University of Southern California's Center for the Study of Immigrant Integration.\par \par \uc2 "We understand that undocumented folks are now part of the state's fabric," Pastor said. "One of six people you touch in the labor force is not here legally. I mean, my God, that's how Southern California functions."\par \par \uc2 Obama said it was a recognition of that reality that led him to announce the deportation "guidance" after House Republicans blocked an effort to pass a comprehensive immigration bill.\par \par \uc2 The plan is called Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA). It would allow illegal immigrants in those categories to remain in the country and apply for work permits if they have been here for at least five years and have not committed felonies or repeated misdemeanors.\par \par \uc2 More than 4 million immigrants could qualify for the program and a simultaneously announced expansion of an earlier program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), which affects those who were brought to this country as children.\par \par \uc2 The Obama administration says it is doing nothing more than setting priorities about whom to deport. As a practical matter, it argues, Congress has given the administration only enough money to deport annually no more than about 400,000 of the nation's estimated 11 million illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 The money should be used to find and deport those with criminal violations, the administration says, rather than immigrants who have established a life here and "anchor families" that would be torn apart by deportation.\par \par \uc2 But a federal district judge in Texas and then an appeals court ruled 2-to-1 that the plan "is much more than nonenforcement: It would affirmatively confer 'lawful presence' and associated benefits on a class of unlawfully present aliens."\par \par \uc2 The ruling was welcomed by Texas officials. But it is Obama's message that resonates in California, where immigrants have become a powerful political force, even if many of them cannot vote. In Los Angeles County, for instance, home to more people than the entire state of Michigan, more than two-thirds of those younger than 18 have at least one parent who is an immigrant.\par \par \uc2 "There are lots of immigrants who can vote who are sympathetic to the plight of the undocumented," Pastor said. Moreover, he said, there is a recognition of how integrated the communities have become.\par \par \uc2 "Forty percent of the people aged 25 to 64 who have a PhD in the state of California are immigrants," he said. "And those high-skilled immigrants - for instance, in Silicon Valley - are often coupled with unskilled undocumented immigrants, because who takes care of their children? Who prepares their food? Who mows their lawns?"\par \par \uc2 A USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll published last month showed that nearly two-thirds of Californians think illegal immigration is a major problem in the state; 9 in 10 Republicans think it is either a "crisis" or major problem.\par \par \uc2 But more than three-fourths of voters said immigrants already here should be allowed to stay, and 60 percent said they should be allowed to apply for citizenship - something DAPA does not contemplate.\par \par \uc2 Even among Republicans, only 36 percent said immigrants should be required to leave, the poll indicated.\par \par \uc2 The political impact in a state where Democrats rule has been striking. The place that in the 1990s would have denied state benefits to any \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  just extended health-care coverage to the undocumented population 19 and younger. This was a compromise from a proposal to extend it to all.\par \par \uc2 Robin Hvidston, executive director of a group called We the People Rising, said her organization testified against the plan but lacks much support in the California legislature.\par \par \uc2 "We feel like we don't have a voice in Sacramento," she said. "We look with more hope to Congress."\par \par \uc2 Solis, whose district of more than 2 million residents is more than 50 percent Latino, said the political climate has changed as the undocumented community has become more established. More than half of those in the county have been there more than 10 years.\par \par \uc2 "There's more of a tolerance because there are so many people now who can say, 'I know somebody who's in that situation,' " she said during an interview in her office. "There are probably some people in this building who are in that situation. I'm pretty sure of it."\par \par \uc2 She also credits a younger generation that has taken advantage of DACA and changes that allow them to pay in-state college tuition.\par \par \uc2 "They paid for their own education because they didn't qualify for federal or even state aid at the time," Solis said. "Why would you want to deport those kids? These are going to be the people who replace me or replace you, the bankers, the lawyers."\par \par \uc2 She might have been talking about Anabel Cuevas. Her father, Eugenio, came from Mexico in 1989, followed by Anabel and her mother, Victoria, a year later.\par \par \uc2 Anabel Cuevas grew up in Pasadena and said she did not know she was undocumented until she was applying for college. She found that she could not accept the scholarship she was offered at a private college because she was not a citizen.\par \par \uc2 "My parents were always hard workers so we were always, I guess you could say, moving one step up, to a better apartment or whatever," she said. Her mother has worked as a babysitter and housekeeper; her father is an independent construction contractor, specializing in tile and stone.\par \par \uc2 When the private college fell through, Anabel Cuevas went to \uc2 California State University at Northridge\uc2 . It cost her father about $70,000, he said.\par \par \uc2 She was able to get a work permit through DACA and now writes computer code for a high-tech company. And hers is one of the many "mixed" families in the county: She has the work permit, her parents are undocumented, and her younger brother, born here, is a citizen.\par \par \uc2 So the Cuevases would qualify. But nothing is certain. The DAPA program may not survive the court challenge. If it does, it could still be revoked. And the deferral from deportation under DAPA is only temporary.\par \par \uc2 But she said it is worth speaking out and being identified. She feels there is little danger of being deported in L.A. County.\par \par \uc2 "But we're so close as a family, I've told [her parents], 'If you guys get deported, I'm coming with you, and we'll start a business somewhere else,' " she said. "My experience as an immigrant is that nothing is guaranteed."\par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com\par \par \uc2 WP20160418california0418\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020160418ec4i0001d\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 powerpost\par {\*\bkmkstart toc76}{\*\bkmkend toc76}\b \uc2 The Daily Trail: Why \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  either wins on the first ballot...or not at all\b0\par\par\uc2 By Rebecca Sinderbrand   \par \uc2 1,715 \uc2 words\par \uc2 14 April 2016\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The odds that \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  will win the fight for the Republican nomination wouldn't drop precipitously with each round of convention votes in Cleveland.\u160\'00\'A0If the battle lasts beyond\u160\'00\'A0a single round, they would essentially evaporate.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 "Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz is close to ensuring that \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  cannot win the GOP nomination on a second ballot at the party's July convention in Cleveland, scooping up scores of delegates who have pledged to vote for him instead of the front-runner if given the chance,"reports Ed O'Keefe.\par \par \uc2 With a recent string of losses to Cruz, Trump's pre-convention path to a\u160\'00\'A01,237 delegate majority\u160\'00\'A0has grown very narrow. Exceedingly\u160\'00\'A0narrow. Economy seat narrow.\par \par \uc2 He's still likely to head into\u160\'00\'A0the first round of voting in Cleveland\u160\'00\'A0with more delegates than anyone else. Including himself, if there are\u160\'00\'A0any additional convention ballots. As of now, that first-round number is almost certainly\u160\'00\'A0his high water mark.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 The #math: "based on the delegate selections made by states and territories, Cruz is poised to pick up at least 130 more votes on a second ballot, according to a \uc2 Washington Post\uc2  analysis. That tally surpasses 170 delegates under less conservative assumptions \u8212\'20\'14 a number that could make it impossible for Trump to emerge victorious."\par \par \uc2 In other words, the\u160\'00\'A0floor fight reality for Trump\u160\'00\'A0may well be\u160\'00\'A0one and done.\u160\'00\'A0And his team knows it.\u160\'00\'A0"There's not going to be a second ballot,"\u160\'00\'A0Manafort told the Post.\par \par \uc2 "Read one way, Manafort's quote is simply an assertion of what he has been saying since he came into the top job last week: Trump is going to get to the 1,237 delegates he needs to be the nominee before the convention," says Chris Cillizza.\u160\'00\'A0"So when the first ballot happens, Trump will be over the number he needs. Case closed.\par \par \uc2 "But what if he doesn't? Read between the lines only slightly and you are left with the distinct impression that Manafort knows it's the first ballot or bust for Trump."\par \par \uc2 And \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  isn't the only one who should be worried by that fact.\u160\'00\'A0"Here's what we know today: Trump is about to have a very good few weeks beginning next Tuesday in New York. He will go into the convention with both the most delegates and the most raw votes. He and his campaign see the first ballot as his one shot to be the nominee. If he doesn't win it on the first ballot, his prospects beyond that are dim. If he doesn't win it on the first ballot, he is laying the groundwork to declare the whole process a fraud.\par \par \uc2 "That paragraph is an absolute nightmare for the Republican establishment. It leaves Trump as either the party's nominee or the disgruntled loser who is already threatening to take his ball (and all of his supporters) and go home if the rules don't work in his favor. T-R-O-U-B-L-E."\par \par \uc2 The front-runner's delegate dilemma is only one item on a long list of campaign headaches.\par \par \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  , mogul, has just about anything a man could ever need or want. \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  , candidate, has spent most of his campaign going without:\u160\'00\'A0without a pollster; without a finance team;\u160\'00\'A0without a convention consigilere; without an aggressive field operation. Over the past few weeks, he's come to the belated realization\u160\'00\'A0that just because these things are less visible doesn't mean they're\u160\'00\'A0optional. (A Porsche\u160\'00\'A0looks great. And it can definitely outpace a Pinto -- unless it's\u160\'00\'A0missing a spark plug.)\par \par \uc2 Late last month, \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  brought veteran GOP strategist Paul Manafort\u160\'00\'A0to deal with his delegate problem. Now he's on to the next item on the list,\u160\'00\'A0hiring former Scott Walker campaign manager Rick Wiley to serve as his ground game guru. (For our\u160\'00\'A0#WaybackWednesday: Wiley comes with his own baggage;\u160\'00\'A0here's\u160\'00\'A0Walker post-mortem last year --\u160\'00\'A0"It's a f---ing bitch, man.")\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Wiley, whose official title will be national political director, "arrives with a mandate from Trump to beef up the campaign's field operations in the states with primaries ahead, including delegate-rich California, as well as prepare for what the Trump team views as a likely general election,"reports Philip Rucker.\par \par \uc2 "By bringing on Wiley and Manafort, Trump is professionalizing what until now had been an unusually insular team led by campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, deputy campaign manager Michael Glassner, spokeswoman Hope Hicks and other Trump loyalists."\par \par \uc2 Wiley's welcome back to the trail:\par \par \uc2 SENATE SCARE?\par \par \uc2 When the GOP took control of the Senate, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell famously\u160\'00\'A0set one ambitious goal for Hill Republicans: Don't be scary. Now they're the ones running (for re-election) scared, reports Paul Kane.\par \par \uc2 "The prevailing belief among McConnell and other Republican leaders was that the party was well positioned in 2016 to reclaim the White House and possibly control all the levers of power in Washington \u8212\'20\'14 unless conservative back-bench lawmakers on Capitol Hill indulged their worst instincts and scared voters away from the party's presidential nominee.\par \par \uc2 "Now, Republicans say, the exact opposite might be occurring. Despite some modest success at governance, Republican majorities on Capitol Hill are imperiled because the tone and proposals coming from GOP presidential contenders have terrified independent voters in key battlegrounds."\par \par \uc2 The Hill #math: seven Senate Republicans are seeking reelection in states that President Obama won twice, and at least three other GOP seats may be\u160\'00\'A0very competitive.\u160\'00\'A0if Republicans were to capture the White House, McConnell can only afford to lose four seats. If his party's presidential nominee falls short, he can lose just three.\par \par \uc2 "Each day the Senate is in session, there's visible angst among Sens. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.), Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), Rob Portman (R-Ohio) and Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.) as they walk to votes and face questions about what Trump's latest controversial proposal or insult means for their reelection chances.\par \par \uc2 "One doesn't need a stopwatch to know that these senators walk faster than they used to in order to get through the media scrums."\par \par \uc2 THE VIEW FROM THE FIELD: Ted Cruz started his day in Pennsylvania.\par \par \uc2 And \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  held a campaign event near Fifth Avenue. (No, not that one.)\par \par \uc2 Like Cruz, he spent part of his\u160\'00\'A0day looking past the New York primary with an appearance in Pittsburgh.\par \par \uc2 Earlier, back on the other Fifth Avenue: Detente?\par \par \uc2 Trump wasn't on Staten Island. But his message has landed there, reports Philip Rucker.\par \par \uc2 "Joe Berardi envisions Trump as a jobs president. 'He'll be good for guys like me,'\u160\'00\'A0the 33-year-old construction worker says as he finishes off a slice of pizza.\par \par \uc2 "Berardi wakes up at 3 a.m., arrives at his work site by 7 and rides the 5 p.m. ferry home to Staten Island, day in and day out, six days a week. He usually works on skyscrapers, but these days he's helping build a Niketown on Broadway.\par \par \uc2 "'\uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  is a real estate genius, you know?'\u160\'00\'A0he says. 'It's not that a billionaire is going to care about me, but as a group, he knows he needs us guys. If he gets rid of all that cheap \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  labor, who's left to do the jobs? Guys like me.'"\par \par \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  spent another day in New York --\u160\'00\'A0where, in a not-unrelated development,\u160\'00\'A0Bernie Sanders has sliced her lead in half since early March.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Sanders, who has been a vocal critic of Verizon during the company's recent labor dispute, visited striking workers today. A few hours later: So did Clinton.\par \par \uc2 Sanders, also declared "another kind of solidarity -- with a trio of Democratic congressional candidates," notes Dave Weigel.\u160\'00\'A0"They included Zephyr Teachout, an author, academic, and surprisingly strong 2014 candidate for governor of New York who is now seeking a seat in the Hudson Valley." (For more\u160\'00\'A0on the "Bernie-crats," check out David Fahrenthold's report.)\par \par \uc2 The Vermont senator will be skipping town soon for his Vatican trip (where he's still hoping to meet with the pope.) Today, he hit the NYU area.\par \par \uc2 Also at the Bernie Sanders Washington Square event -- the first of three concert rallies featuring local artists (for New York, that means Vampire Weekend, Grizzly Bear and TV on the Radio): this guy, who is apparently\u160\'00\'A0sticking with that\u160\'00\'A0shirt/sign combo.\par \par \uc2 Also at the Sanders rally (if\u160\'00\'A0one more campaign does it this way, it's officially a trend!):\par \par \uc2 Elsewhere in New York...\par \par \uc2 Also: apparently John Kasich eats everything with a fork, more or less. Including, he said today, ice cream. (Please direct your queries on this to the Kasich campaign -- we have no answers here.)\par \par \uc2 TRAIL MIX: Some potential good news for\u160\'00\'A0Trump: reports late Wednesday that\u160\'00\'A0campaign manager Corey Lewandowski may not be prosecuted after all.\par \par \uc2 --\uc2 Jane Sanders\uc2  says that tough Daily News editorial board\u160\'00\'A0meeting with her husband was "an inquisition."\par \par \uc2 --Ahead of Maryland's April 26 primary,\u160\'00\'A0Clinton and Sanders are both airing ads in the state\u160\'00\'A0that invoke the deaths of African Americans in police custody. Early voting in Maryland begins\u160\'00\'A0tomorrow.\par \par \uc2 --Speaking of TV ads: Bernie Sanders has run more of them than \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  for each of the past six months. \u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 --Still more ad news: The pro-Cruz Trusted Leadership PAC is hitting Kasich\u160\'00\'A0ahead of the New York primary.\par \par \uc2 --Today, the Cruz team got a\u160\'00\'A0campaign #protip reminder: Before you publicly\u160\'00\'A0complain that a rival candidate gets too many television interviews, maybe you should think about saying yes to interview invitations first.\par \par \uc2 A New Jersey court challenge over Cruz's citizenship has failed.\u160\'00\'A0\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 YOUR DAILY TRAIL PIT STOP:\u160\'00\'A0For Ted Cruz, the\u160\'00\'A0campaign really is a roller coaster ride.\u160\'00\'A0Today, he visited Rainbow Gardens in Erie, Pa., ahead of his \uc2 CNN\uc2  town hall in New York,\u160\'00\'A0his first public appearance in the Empire State since last week.\par \par \uc2 "Many people have compared the ups and downs of a campaign to a roller coaster," he tweeted.\u160\'00\'A0"Today, we decided to see for ourselves\u8230\'20\'26"\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020160414ec4e000dx\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 THE BIG IDEA:\par \par \uc2 -- For 35 days, The Post's David Maraniss and Robert Samuels crossed the nation interviewing voters. Their four-part dispatch, with vignettes from eight states, just posted. Some highlights from their 20,000-word series:\par \par \uc2 There is so much anger out there in America: "Anger at Wall Street. Anger at Muslims. Anger at trade deals. Anger at Washington. Anger at police shootings of young black men. Anger at President Obama. Anger at Republican obstructionists. Anger about political correctness. Anger about the role of big money in campaigns. Anger about the poisoned water of Flint. Anger about deportations. Anger about undocumented immigrants. Anger about a career that didn't go as expected. Anger about a lost way of life. Mob anger at groups of protesters in their midst. Specific anger and undefined anger and even anger about anger."\par \par \uc2 This anger is the culmination of long-emerging trends in American life: "The decomposition of traditional institutions. The descent of politics into reality-TV entertainment. Demographic and economic shifts quickening the impulses of inclusion and exclusion and us vs. them. All of it leading to this moment of great unsettling, with the Republican Party unraveling, the Democrats barely keeping it together, and both moving farther away from each other by the week, reflecting the splintering not only of the body politic but of the national ideal."\par \par \uc2 But there is also hope and optimism: "For every disgruntled person out there who felt undone by the system and threatened by the way the country was changing, caught in the bind of stagnant wages or longing for an America of the past, we found someone who had endured decades of discrimination and hardship and yet still felt optimistic about the future and had no desire to go back. In this season of discontent, there were still as many expressions of hope as of fear. On a larger level, there were as many communities enjoying a sense of revival as there were fighting against deterioration and despair."\par \par \uc2 -- Part 3 focuses on Las Vegas: Sin City is "our nation's great national cliche, more excessive in its hyperbole than the boasts in a \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  stump speech, at once the representation and perversion of the American Dream."\par \par \uc2 The paradox: "It is by its very sustenance a city teeming with losers, yet the tallest residential structure in town has Trump's name on it. People flock here in hopes of something gained, of some miraculous transfer of wealth, of beating or evening the odds rigged against them, of leaving inhibitions behind, in fear and loathing, in remembrance of things lost."\par \par \uc2 How would Hunter S. Thompson cover Trump? "It was 45 years ago that gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson beat his way to Las Vegas, longing for something already gone, a time when 'there was a fantastic universal sense that whatever we were doing was right, that we were winning.' He was writing in 1971 about the heady counterculture days of the mid-'60s, although the words could be appropriated by various ideologies this election year. Feeling out of time, his senses altered by hallucinogenic drugs, Thompson rendered a novelistic evocation of Las Vegas as the wasteland of the righteous capitalist ideal. One can only wonder what Thompson would have done with the materialization of candidate Trump."\par \par \uc2 Two memorable metaphors\u8212\'20\'14\par \par \uc2 * "Watching the Republican Party leadership deal with Trump, one person said, was like witnessing a high-anxiety Vegas act \u8212\'20\'14 the illusionist David Blaine trying to escape from a water tank. Surely he will loosen his way out from the chains and handcuffs and rise to safety. Time passes, even in this city without clocks, and is it already too late? How much longer can he hold his breath? The establishment was in the water tank, running out of air."\par \par \uc2 * Melissa Petersen sits in the back yard of her home on Barbara Street in Las Vegas and listens to the shrieks coming from atop the Stratosphere, a giant observation tower that rises high above her Beverly Green neighborhood: "She knew the screams by heart \u8212\'20\'14 three variations that differentiated the amusement rides that provoked them, from the mechanical claw to the bungee jump to the capsule shot up and down. Las Vegas again capturing the American mood. There was the hysterical giggling scream. There was the scream of utter terror. And there was the undulating scream that started high-pitched and fell to a long and low moan."\par \par \uc2 -- \u160\'00\'A0 Part Four is anchored in Macomb County, Michigan, a mostly white and middle-class suburb above Detroit. It's where the people once known as Reagan Democrats, who have long since become Republicans, helped deliver a decisive win for Trump in last week's primary. Two guys canvassing together speak to the power of Trump: Jason Powrozek, 17, was inspired to get involved by "The Apprentice." He placed more calls from Trump's phone banks in Michigan than anyone else. Rick Cruz, a 62-year-old self-employed entrepreneur, shared Jason's admiration for Trump's commercial success. "In listening to Cruz, one could see a connection between Trump's evangelism about money and his unexpected popularity among religious evangelicals, between mega-churches brimming with believers who want to be saved and arenas filled with people who want to be taught how to become rich," Maraniss and Samuels write. "Prophets and profits, in this sense speaking the same language."\par \par \uc2 -- For your reading pleasure:\par \par \uc2 * Part 1: "The great unsettling."\par \par \uc2 * Part 2: "Longing for something lost."\par \par \uc2 * Part 3 "Awaiting a political awakening."\par \par \uc2 * Part 4: "A nation divided."\par \par \uc2 WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:\par \par \uc2 -- Former Breitbart News reporter Michelle Fields, the victim of an alleged assault by Trump's campaign manager, will not appear on the Fox News show "Cashin' In" for the foreseeable future, The\u160\'00\'A0Daily Beast\u160\'00\'A0reports.\u160\'00\'A0"Sources say Fields was informed of the decision last night by Eric Bolling's producer, who said she was no longer 'impartial' to Trump, and could not speak objectively on his candidacy. Some think the complaint is a bit hypocritical, as Bolling's signature style implores viewers to rise up against liberals as a 'cancer' or an 'Ebola-like virus.'"\par \par \uc2 \u160\'00\'A0A Fox News spokesperson denies that there has been any discussion about permanently removing Fields from the show and said Bolling was not involved in any way. \uc2 Politico\uc2  : "Bolling, who has been called Fields' mentor, said on Fox News recently that he hasn't spoken to Fields since the incident but suggested she might have also been grabbed by a Secret Service agent. Challenged by his colleagues that video clearly showed Lewandowski reaching for Fields, Bolling said if it was Lewandowski, he should apologize. Fields, who has been shown support by several other Fox personalities, was interviewed twice in the past week by host Megyn Kelly to talk about the incident."\par \par \uc2 GET SMART FAST\par \par \uc2 * Alzheimer's "lost memories" might some\u160\'00\'A0day be recoverable, according to research from\u160\'00\'A0MIT.\u160\'00\'A0 Nobel Prize-winner\u160\'00\'A0Susumu Tonegawa provides strong evidence that, rather than destroying memories, Alzheimer's renders them inaccessible \u8211\'20\'13 raising hopes that memory loss caused could\u160\'00\'A0one day be reversed. (Ariana Eunjung Cha)\par \par \uc2 * The U.S. resumed mail service with Cuba for the first time in more than 50 years. (Joe Davidson)\par \par \uc2 * The Air Force fired one of its most senior generals after an investigation revealed he exchanged "sexually suggestive" emails with a lower-ranking female officer. Lt. Gen. John Hesterman, who formerly ran the aerial campaign against ISIS, has denied that any physical relationship took place. (Dan Lamothe)\par \par \uc2 * Elizabeth Warren criticized Rep. Blaine Luetkemeyer\u160\'00\'A0(R-Mo.)\u160\'00\'A0for making a "sexist and offensive" comment about her at an \uc2 American Bankers Association\uc2  meeting. He\u160\'00\'A0said the banking industry needs to "neuter"\u160\'00\'A0Warren and called her "the Darth Vader of the financial services world."

(Sudarsan Raghavan)\par \par \uc2 THE LATEST ON THE\u160\'00\'A0REPUBLICAN RACE\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 -- " GOP operatives, conservative leaders meet to thwart Trump ," by Robert Costa: "A secretive group of Republican operatives and conservative leaders convened Thursday morning for more than three hours (at the Army-Navy Club)\u160\'00\'A0to discuss ways to unite the right against \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  , with a presentation about the feasibility of mounting a third-party challenge as well as extensive deliberations about whether a coalition of anti-Trump forces could prevent the billionaire mogul from securing the party's presidential nomination at the July convention in Cleveland. 'It's certainly not too late,'\u160\'00\'A0Rep. Trent Franks (R-Ariz.) said as he left the session. 'You could get another party on the ballot. A candidate could be picked as late as August. \u8230\'20\'26 It would have to be a movement conservative.'"\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 * "A second attendee\u160\'00\'A0said Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska was one name mentioned as a possible late-entry contender who conservatives could rally around. \u160\'00\'A0In a statement, the senator (who was not at the meeting)\u160\'00\'A0said he would not run: 'Absolutely not. I've got three little kids and the only callings that I want: raising them and serving Nebraskans. No way.'"\par \par \uc2 * "Later, radio host Erick Erickson, who helped organize the event, published a statement on behalf of the group. 'We call for a unity ticket,' said Erickson. 'We encourage all former Republican candidates not currently supporting Trump to unite against him and encourage all candidates to hold delegates on the first ballot.'"\par \par \uc2 * Paul Ryan flew to Palm Beach for a dinner last night with some of the\u160\'00\'A0GOP's top\u160\'00\'A0donors, organized by Paul Singer. They are divided about\u160\'00\'A0the path forward,\u160\'00\'A0\uc2 Politico\uc2  \u160\'00\'A0reports.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 -- We may not know whether there will be a contested convention until CALIFORNIA votes on JUNE 7.Philip Bump explains:\u160\'00\'A0"172 delegates will be at stake, nearly 14 percent of what a candidate needs in order to gain a majority. And just to make things dramatic, nearly all of those 172 delegates will be distributed to the winners of each of the state's 53 congressional districts. Meaning that when polls close at 11 p.m. Eastern on June 7, we will likely be tracking 53 individual elections in order to figure out if Trump or Cruz hit the 1,237 mark. \u8230\'20\'26 Meaning, one year after we watched Trump glide down that escalator, astonished, we may spend half the night watching returns trickle in from Yolo County to see if Trump has clinched the nomination." On June 7, voters will also go to the polls in Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico and South Dakota.\par \par \uc2 -- Sen. Lindsey Graham threw his support behind Cruz, calling him the "best choice" for Republicans who want to stop Trump.\u160\'00\'A0The South Carolina Senator will host a fundraiser for Cruz at Monday's American Israel Public Affairs Committee Policy Conference.

And out of concern that a Republican president in 2017 \u8212\'20\'14 either Trump or Cruz \u8212\'20\'14 would weaken or reverse some of his landmark policies, Obama and his surrogates have started making the case that it is essential for the GOP to be defeated in November. As a result, Obama is poised to be the most active sitting president on the campaign trail in decades. \u8230\'20\'26 Several Democratic strategists say they are confident that Obama can boost turnout for their candidates in key states, including Colorado, Florida, Nevada and Virginia."\par \par \uc2 -- Obama, privately urging Democrats to rally behind Clinton, acknowledged\u160\'00\'A0concerns that she's not perceived as authentic and that she's not generating enough excitement: The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  spoke with donors who attended a private fundraiser that the president spoke at in Austin last week. He reportedly said Sanders is nearing the point at which his campaign would end, and that the party must soon come together to back her.

Throughout this campaign, our analytics partners at \uc2 Zignal Labs\uc2  have seen Sanders grab a disproportionate share of social media traffic, while Clinton receives at least half, if not more, of the television coverage. That trend speaks to the enthusiasm of Sanders supporters and the fact that the typical social media user tends to be younger than the average voter. In the wake of Clinton's five-state sweep on Tuesday, Zignal has only seen her share of TV coverage grow, while social media continues to show enthusiasm for Sanders. Below is a look at the share of voice for each Democratic candidate on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and on TV for Wednesday and Thursday:\par \par \uc2 How much is Sanders dominating\u160\'00\'A0among young voters? A group that tracks the youth vote, defined as people under 30, says\u160\'00\'A0Sanders has won the votes of more than 1.5 million of them. "Clinton is second and Trump trails just behind, but the two front-runners\u160\'00\'A0combine for just 1.2 million votes \u8212\'20\'14 300,000 less than Sanders alone.\u160\'00\'A0So far, he's taking 71 percent of the two-candidate vote among young voters," Aaron Blake reports.\par \par \uc2 But young people, of course, do not vote at the same rates as older folks, who love Hillary. And her margin has been just as big, if not bigger, among African Americans.\u160\'00\'A0This is the scene at HRC's HQ in Brooklyn:\par \par \uc2 THE SCOTUS CONFIRMATION BATTLE\u8212\'20\'14\par \par \uc2 -- "Democrats plan push to force hearings on Supreme Court nomination," by Mike DeBonis and \uc2 Juliet Eilperin\uc2 : "At the White House, Obama held a conference call Thursday with thousands of supporters across the country while senior adviser Valerie Jarrett met on Capitol Hill with members of the \uc2 Congressional Black Caucus\uc2  . The president's mobilization call was organized by the Constitutional Responsibility Project, a nonprofit group formed by several former top Obama staffer. The group includes Stephanie Cutter, Julianna Smoot, Anita Dunn and Amy Brundage."\par \par \uc2 "The new tax-exempt organization, which is aimed at providing a platform for hundreds of groups to share information, has planned a series of events over the congressional recess, including a MoveOn Day of Action on Monday, with more than 50 grass-roots events outside senators' offices, and a robust social-media campaign. In Ohio, teachers will aim to put pressure on Sen. Rob Portman (R) with 'Do Your Job Learn-ins' in Cleveland, Cincinnati and Lima. In Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, nurses, firefighters and union members will call on Sen. Patrick J. Toomey (R) to meet with Garland and hold a hearing on his nomination.'"\par \par \uc2 "You're going to be surprised at how hard we're going to work to make sure this is on the front pages of all the papers," Senate Minority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) told reporters after meeting with Garland.\par \par \uc2 -- "Several additional Republican senators said that they would grant Garland a courtesy meeting when the Senate returns after a two-week recess that begins Friday.\u160\'00\'A0In every case, however, they insisted that such a meeting would not change their position on hearings for Garland. 'I'll meet with the guy, but trust me: We're not going to let the Supreme Court flip,' said Sen. Ron Johnson (Wis.). 'And this nominee obviously would flip the court, particularly on an issue that is pretty important in Wisconsin \u8212\'20\'14 the right to keep and bear arms.' Two other GOP senators, Bill Cassidy (La.) and Mike Rounds (S.D.), also said they would be open to a courtesy meeting but would not change their minds on the election-year blockade of the nominee."\par \par \uc2 -- "Where the Senate itself would typically take the lead role in vetting a Supreme Court nominee, there are no plans this time for the Judiciary Committee to hire its usual complement of additional staffers to conduct such checks. Beth Levine, a spokeswoman for the panel's Republicans, confirmed that there are no plans to hire additional investigators for a Garland probe. America Rising Squared, a GOP-aligned opposition research organization, had been working with the \uc2 Judicial Crisis Network\uc2  and the \uc2 Republican National Committee\uc2  to investigate potential nominees. Brian Rogers, the firm's executive director, said that he now had about a dozen researchers digging into Garland's background; some will be deployed across the country to vet the judge."\par \par \uc2 -- There is another possible endgame to the scenario I laid out in yesterday's 202. Many liberal activists who feel like Garland is too squishy think they could pressure POTUS to withdraw Garland if Clinton wins, so that she could appoint someone more liberal. "Waiting until a lame duck session to decide whether to act is a high risk strategy, as Obama could always withdraw the nomination, giving a President Clinton the opportunity to swing for the fences," Jonathan Adler, a libertarian-leaning law professor at Case Western Reserve University, told Greg Sargent.\par \par \uc2 -- Could Obama withdraw Garland's nomination during the lame-duck? Yes. Would he? No way. As I wrote yesterday, Obama picked Garland partially because he thinks he could get confirmed during a lame duck. In the final weeks of his presidency, he's not going to cave to liberal interest groups. And he'll be thinking about his own legacy, not Hillary's.\par \par \uc2 -- Would Senate Republicans try to confirm Garland in the lame-duck session? Orrin Hatch floated this scenario yesterday morning, but Mitch McConnell and John Cornyn said that will not happen. "I know there have been some members of the press who asked about well, if not now, how about in a lame-duck session of the Congress," Cornyn (#2 in leadership) said on the floor. "I think that is a terrible idea." The Hill quotes "a lawmaker close to McConnell" saying it would be "insincere" for Republicans to turn around in the lame duck and consider Garland after refusing for months to even hold a hearing. (That, of course, does not mean they won't do it\u8230\'20\'26if they think it would pass muster with the base and avert a more liberal nominee\u8230\'20\'26)\par \par \uc2 WAPO HIGHLIGHTS:\par \par \uc2 -- " Syria shows that Russia built an effective military.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 's pledge not to deport any illegal immigrants except violent criminals and terrorists represents a major break from President Obama, and it could vastly increase the number of people who would be allowed to stay in the country.\par \par \uc2 The declaration this week from the Democratic presidential front-runner drew praise from immigrant rights groups, which have largely given up hope on pushing legislation that would create a path to citizenship for the nation's 11\u160\'00\'A0million illegal immigrants. Many activists have sought in recent months to push Obama and his potential Democratic successors for stronger executive actions.\par \par \uc2 Clinton's position, which she described during Wednesday's Washington Post-Univision debate, gives her an effective way to energize Hispanic voters, particularly in contrast to calls by Republican front-runner \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  for mass deportations. But it was not clear Thursday whether, as president, she would be able to keep the promise.\par \par \uc2 The Supreme Court is expected to set an important marker testing the White House's power in deciding how to enforce border laws when it rules on the constitutionality of Obama's program to grant work permits to millions of illegal immigrants. A ruling is expected as early as June.\par \par \uc2 Conservative critics of Obama's policies suggested that Clinton has opened the door to far greater leniency and lax enforcement.\par \par \uc2 "This really is a breathtaking step toward open borders," said \uc2 Mark Krikorian\uc2  , executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which supports lower immigration levels. "If you take that step, it needs to be put in front of the public: Do you think immigration laws are irrelevant unless the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  has committed a violent offense or drug crime?"\par \par \uc2 Advocates hailed Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, her rival for the Democratic nomination, who joined Clinton on Wednesday night in expressing a desire to break from Obama's policies.\par \par \uc2 The government's deportation policies have been a source of controversy for much of Obama's tenure.\par \par \uc2 In announcing a series of executive actions in November 2014, Obama said that his administration would no longer target illegal immigrants who have not committed other crimes, instead \u173\'00\'ADprioritizing the deportation of \u173\'00\'AD"felons, not families."\par \par \uc2 The only exception, in new guidelines issued by the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2  , were immigrants who arrived illegally since Jan.\u160\'00\'A01, 2014, including a surge of tens of thousands of women and children who entered the United States after fleeing violence and corruption in Central America.\par \par \uc2 The administration's decision to deport those who do not qualify for political asylum has angered immigrant rights groups, especially after the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2  conducted a series of enforcement raids on women and children in January.\par \par \uc2 "The fact that both [Clinton and Sanders] had the wherewithal to say we should not deport children, as a stark contrast to the Obama administration, and that both mentioned they agreed with the president on most things except on this was very powerful and very important," said Marielena Hincapie, executive director of the \uc2 National Immigration Law Center\uc2  .\par \par \uc2 Immigration lawyers said they believed Clinton's pledge would be well within the law. Though the Supreme Court is reviewing Obama's work-permit program, Clinton's action would be an administrative directive to broaden the DHS enforcement guidelines but would not necessarily add more work permits, the legal experts said.\par \par \uc2 "I didn't hear anything troubling legally at all," said David Leopold, an immigration lawyer in Ohio who has worked on cases involving undocumented immigrants. He said the Obama administration has taken "an overly rigid view of their own priorities."\par \par \uc2 "What I heard Clinton say is 'I will not return children to violence,'\u8201\'20\'09" Leopold said.\par \par \uc2 A White House spokesman declined to comment Thursday, citing past statements from the administration defending its policies. Obama aides have said their decision to deport those who recently crossed the border is aimed at discouraging a surge of additional undocumented immigrants and sending a message of deterrence to those considering making the dangerous journey north.\par \par \uc2 Clinton's move to the left of Obama on immigration marks a rare moment in which she is seeking to distance herself from a president whose Cabinet she served. In recent months, she has tried to fire up African American voters to back her over Sanders by presenting herself as a guardian of Obama's legacy. In separating herself from Obama on deportations, she is seeking to galvanize the fast-growing Latino and Asian American voting blocs, which overwhelmingly supported Obama in 2008 and 2012 but have demonstrated frustration with the president over deportations.\par \par \uc2 Clinton had previously denounced the administration's enforcement raids. On Wednesday, she went further when she told \uc2 Univision\uc2  anchor Jorge Ramos: "I would not deport children. I do not want to deport family members either, Jorge. I want to, as I said, prioritize who would be deported: violent criminals, people planning terrorist attacks, anybody who threatens us. That's a relatively small universe."\par \par \uc2 Sanders said during the debate that he agreed with Obama on many issues but "he is wrong on this issue of deportation." Sanders emphasized that the Central American nations were the "most violent region in our hemisphere" and that children from that region should be allowed to stay in the United States.\par \par \uc2 Ramos, a leading advocate for immigrant rights, told The Post in a Thursday interview that the willingness of the two Democratic presidential candidates to distance themselves from Obama on deportations was "big, big news."\par \par \uc2 Ramos said the deportation of more than 2\u160\'00\'A0million immigrants during Obama's tenure was a "silent tragedy for many Hispanic families." He said his questioning at the debate reflected a shift in tactics for the immigrant rights community, which has long focused on a comprehensive legislative overhaul of border-control laws that includes a legal path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Disappointed by the high-profile failure of bipartisan efforts in Congress during the George W. Bush and Obama administrations, advocates said their priority is now focused on winning deportation protections for those already in the United States before figuring out a new legislative strategy to get them full legal status and, ultimately, citizenship.\par \par \uc2 "Whoever the next president is, he or she cannot do anything [on comprehensive reform] without bipartisan support," Ramos said. "That may not happen for many years. The next battle for many Latino organizations has to do with the deportations."\par \par \uc2 Supporters of the Obama administration have defended the president's approach by suggesting that he needed to be tough on deportations in order to persuade Republicans, who have called for greater border security, to negotiate over a comprehensive bill.\par \par \uc2 But immigrant rights advocates said the evidence during Obama's tenure is that such an approach is foolhardy.\par \par \uc2 "That is a failed strategy," Hincapie said. "After seven, almost eight years, there is very little patience for that among immigrant communities."\par \par \uc2 david.nakamura@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020160311ec3b000m9\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved   \par \par \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 's pledge not to deport any illegal immigrants except violent criminals and terrorists represents a major break from President Obama, and it could vastly increase the number of people who would be allowed to stay in the country.\par \par \uc2 The declaration this week from the Democratic presidential front-runner drew praise from immigrant rights groups, which have largely given up hope on pushing legislation that would create a path to citizenship for the nation's 11 million illegal immigrants. Many activists have sought in recent months to push Obama and his potential Democratic successors for stronger executive actions.\par \par \uc2 Clinton's position, which she described during Wednesday's Washington Post-Univision debate, gives her an effective way to energize Hispanic voters, particularly in contrast to calls by Republican front-runner \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  for mass deportations. But it was not clear Thursday whether, as president, she would be able to keep the promise.\par \par \uc2 The Supreme Court is expected to set an important marker testing the White House's power in deciding how to enforce border laws when it rules on the constitutionality of Obama's program to grant work permits to millions of illegal immigrants. A ruling is expected as early as June.\par \par \uc2 Conservative critics of Obama's policies suggested that Clinton has opened the door to far greater leniency and lax enforcement.\par \par \uc2 "This really is a breathtaking step toward open borders," said \uc2 Mark Krikorian\uc2  , executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which supports lower immigration levels. "If you take that step, it needs to be put in front of the public: Do you think immigration laws are irrelevant unless the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  has committed a violent offense or drug crime?"\par \par \uc2 Advocates hailed Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, her rival for the Democratic nomination, who joined Clinton on Wednesday night in expressing a desire to break from Obama's policies.\par \par \uc2 The government's deportation policies have been a source of controversy for much of Obama's tenure.\par \par \uc2 In announcing a series of executive actions in November 2014, Obama said that his administration would no longer target illegal immigrants who have not committed other crimes, instead prioritizing the deportation of "felons, not families."\par \par \uc2 The only exception, in new guidelines issued by the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2  , were immigrants who arrived illegally since Jan. 1, 2014, including a surge of tens of thousands of women and children who entered the United States after fleeing violence and corruption in Central America.\par \par \uc2 The administration's decision to deport those who do not qualify for political asylum has angered immigrant rights groups, especially after the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2  conducted a series of enforcement raids on women and children in January.\par \par \uc2 "The fact that both [Clinton and Sanders] had the wherewithal to say we should not deport children, as a stark contrast to the Obama administration, and that both mentioned they agreed with the president on most things except on this was very powerful and very important," said Marielena Hincapie, executive director of the \uc2 National Immigration Law Center\uc2  .\par \par \uc2 Immigration lawyers said they believed Clinton's pledge would be well within the law. Though the Supreme Court is reviewing Obama's work-permit program, Clinton's action would be an administrative directive to broaden the DHS enforcement guidelines but would not necessarily add more work permits, the legal experts said.\par \par \uc2 "I didn't hear anything troubling legally at all," said David Leopold, an immigration lawyer in Ohio who has worked on cases involving undocumented immigrants. He said the Obama administration has taken "an overly rigid view of their own priorities."\par \par \uc2 "What I heard Clinton say is 'I will not return children to violence,' " Leopold said.\par \par \uc2 A White House spokesman declined to comment Thursday, citing past statements from the administration defending its policies. Obama aides have said their decision to deport those who recently crossed the border is aimed at discouraging a surge of additional undocumented immigrants and sending a message of deterrence to those considering making the dangerous journey north.\par \par \uc2 Clinton's move to the left of Obama on immigration marks a rare moment in which she is seeking to distance herself from a president whose Cabinet she served. In recent months, she has tried to fire up African American voters to back her over Sanders by presenting herself as a guardian of Obama's legacy. In separating herself from Obama on deportations, she is seeking to galvanize the fast-growing Latino and Asian American voting blocs, which overwhelmingly supported Obama in 2008 and 2012 but have demonstrated frustration with the president over deportations.\par \par \uc2 Clinton had previously denounced the administration's enforcement raids. On Wednesday, she went further when she told \uc2 Univision\uc2  anchor Jorge Ramos: "I would not deport children. I do not want to deport family members either, Jorge. I want to, as I said, prioritize who would be deported: violent criminals, people planning terrorist attacks, anybody who threatens us. That's a relatively small universe."\par \par \uc2 Sanders said during the debate that he agreed with Obama on many issues but "he is wrong on this issue of deportation." Sanders emphasized that the Central American nations were the "most violent region in our hemisphere" and that children from that region should be allowed to stay in the United States.\par \par \uc2 Ramos, a leading advocate for immigrant rights, told The Post in a Thursday interview that the willingness of the two Democratic presidential candidates to distance themselves from Obama on deportations was "big, big news."\par \par \uc2 Ramos said the deportation of more than 2 million immigrants during Obama's tenure was a "silent tragedy for many Hispanic families." He said his questioning at the debate reflected a shift in tactics for the immigrant rights community, which has long focused on a comprehensive legislative overhaul of border-control laws that includes a legal path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Disappointed by the high-profile failure of bipartisan efforts in Congress during the George W. Bush and Obama administrations, advocates said their priority is now focused on winning deportation protections for those already in the United States before figuring out a new legislative strategy to get them full legal status and, ultimately, citizenship.\par \par \uc2 "Whoever the next president is, he or she cannot do anything [on comprehensive reform] without bipartisan support," Ramos said. "That may not happen for many years. The next battle for many Latino organizations has to do with the deportations."\par \par \uc2 Supporters of the Obama administration have defended the president's approach by suggesting that he needed to be tough on deportations in order to persuade Republicans, who have called for greater border security, to negotiate over a comprehensive bill.\par \par \uc2 But immigrant rights advocates said the evidence during Obama's tenure is that such an approach is foolhardy.\par \par \uc2 "That is a failed strategy," Hincapie said. "After seven, almost eight years, there is very little patience for that among immigrant communities."\par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com \par \par \uc2 WP20160311deportations0311\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020160311ec3b0001l\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  and Bernie Sanders clashed in a debate sponsored by The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2  and \uc2 Univision\uc2  on Wednesday night, the day after a win in the Michigan primary breathed new life into Sanders's underdog campaign.\par \par \uc2 The duel in Miami was the final\u160\'00\'A0one on the schedule (for now, at least) and gave the candidates their last, best chance to set a course for the rest of the race with a national audience watching.\par \par \uc2 How did they do?\u160\'00\'A0Below are our winners and losers.\par \par \uc2 WINNERS\par \par \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 : This debate was a minefield for her. She was coming off a disappointing loss in Michigan that gave Sanders some momentum. She got asked about possibly being indicted (!), about whether she lied about Benghazi and about about her being seen as untrustworthy. And the moderators demanded answers. Clinton avoided a disaster and came out as the better debater, yet again. And despite a couple missteps -- she STILL doesn't have a good answer on her Wall Street speeches?!? -- she had some very strong moments that will likely endure more than anything else.\par \par \uc2 When asked about her poor honesty ratings and her not-so-great public image, she had this to say: "I am not a natural politician, in case you haven't noticed, like my husband or President Obama." She added: "This is not easy for me." It was self-aware, and it turned a question about her not being honest into an answer in which she was uniquely\u160\'00\'A0candid.\u160\'00\'A0And then there was the moment she was speaking directly to a woman whose family had been broken up via deportation. \uc2 Univision\uc2  's Enrique Acevedo translated Clinton's heartfelt, slowly spoken answer in this indelible image, with Clinton\u160\'00\'A0featuring in a small splitscreen most of the time (though not in this particular image):\par \par \uc2 Bernie Sanders's suit: The man wore a BROWN SUIT. (Or maybe it was blue? No. No, it was brown.) This was basically all anybody could talk about on social media for the first 10 minutes. The Fix is on-record in support of non-traditional fashion choices. Think: \uc2 Marco Rubio\uc2  's boots. And President Obama's tan suit. We have seen way too many political men wearing blue and charcoal suits over the years, and Sanders boldly went where no presidential candidate has gone before ... er, at least in a long time. One issue, though, Bernie: No more button-down collars. They should only be worn sans tie.\par \par \uc2 Ted Kennedy: When it comes to a Democratic primary with a premium on getting to the left, the liberal lion of the Senate is bound to get some mentions. He was basically the Democrats' own version of Ronald Reagan on Wednesday night, as Clinton recalled the immigration reform he spearheaded in 2007. Clinton noted that Sanders opposed the bill -- suggesting a guilt-by-lack-of-association with Kennedy. Sanders, meanwhile, assured us twice that Kennedy was a very "close friend."\par \par \uc2 Moderators: Look, Clinton supporters and Clinton herself won't like the fact that Jorge Ramos asked the former secretary of state about being indicted. And they probably really won't like that he pressed her for a firmer "yes" or "no" on whether she would deport\u160\'00\'A0\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  children. But this debate featured something that is often lacking in debates -- follow-ups that demand firm positions. Ramos and The Post's own Karen Tumulty regularly pressed the two candidates when they didn't give a solid answer, trying to get an affirmative or a negative. It's not easy, but every moderator should do this. Candidates obfuscate way too much.\par \par \uc2 LOSERS\par \par \uc2 Sanders's chances at the nomination: As noted above, this was the last debate we currently have scheduled. This was Sanders's chance, after a big win in Michigan, to change the course of the race. And he was aggressive. He tried. He's getting better. He even handled a very tough question (in South Florida, no less) about his past praise for Fidel Castro. But he didn't do anything to change the fact that Clinton remains the overwhelming favorite to win the Democratic nomination. Sanders will likely continue to amass delegates and win some states, but he still needs that game-changer to really make this a race. He didn't get it on Wednesday night. And one wonders\u160\'00\'A0where else it might come from.\par \par \uc2 Clinton's attacks: Clinton attacked Sanders in a series of ways that are, well, pretty\u160\'00\'A0disingenuous. After attacking him for being against the auto bailout at Sunday's debate -- he voted for it\u160\'00\'A0but was against the bank bailout\u160\'00\'A0-- Clinton doubled down on some similarly odd lines of attack Wednesday. She tied him to Republicans for opposing Ted Kennedy's immigration bill and suggested he supports the anti-\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  Minutemen. She noted a Koch brothers group is running an ad thanking Sanders for voting against the \uc2 Export-Import Bank\uc2  . And she (yet again) suggested he's trying to undo Obamacare by replacing it with single-payer health care. In each case, it's as if Clinton is painting Sanders as an ally of Republicans. In each case, that's just not true. Mostly, he's taking these positions because he's further to the left than most Democrats. Peter Hamby said it well:\par \par \uc2 Being a senator: Just in case you forgot that being a senator is not a great thing when it comes to becoming president, this debate should disavow you of that. Voting on large packages allows your opponents to pick out one thing that you might or might not support or oppose, and tar you with it over and over again. Plus, you are constantly weighing in on the issues of the day in your public comments. Immigration is case in point. Both candidates struggled Wednesday to explain away things that made them sound not terribly in favor of comprehensive immigration reform. One wonders if voters who care about that issue -- Latinos, in particular -- liked either of their answers.\par \par \uc2 Clinton Throws Flash Grenade To Divert Attention From Question About Senate Voting Record {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://t.co/FPky1Ka1S5"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://t.co/FPky1Ka1S5 }}}\uc2  pic.twitter.com/F1XfSHaoFt\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020160310ec3a001jn\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

And that's okay. ; The \uc2 Univision\uc2  anchor seemed to cross over into advocacy.\b0\par\par\uc2 By Callum Borchers   \par \uc2 771 \uc2 words\par \uc2 10 March 2016\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 A campaign full of pledges\u160\'00\'A0\u8212\'20\'14 to be loyal to \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  , to support the Republican nominee, no matter what\u160\'00\'A0\u8212\'20\'14 got one more at Wednesday's Democratic presidential debate in Miami, when moderator Jorge Ramos pressed \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  and Bernie Sanders into a promise not to deport \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  children.\par \par \uc2 It took some effort, and Ramos seemed to cross over into advocacy, particularly during his exchange with Clinton. The \uc2 Univision\uc2  anchor's questions strongly implied that continuing President Obama's deportation efforts \u8212\'20\'14 which have included sending children back to their native countries\u160\'00\'A0\u8212\'20\'14 would be wrong.\par \par \uc2 Ramos began by playing tape of a previous interview with Clinton in which the Democratic front-runner did not directly answer the question about deporting children to his satisfaction.\par \par \uc2 RAMOS: So secretary, you seem to be defending President Obama's deportation policy. And as you know, so far he has deported more than 2.5 million immigrants. So if you really don't want to be the next deporter-in-chief, can you promise tonight that you won't deport children and that you won't deport immigrants who don't have a criminal record? And this time, could I get a yes or no answer?\par \par \uc2 CLINTON: Yes, you can because the questions you were asking me were about children seeking asylum. And we have laws. That was the most critical thing I said. Under our laws \u8212\'20\'14\u160\'00\'A0I would like to see those laws changed; I would like see added to them a guaranteed counsel and other support for children. But if you are asking about everyone who is already here, undocumented immigrants, the 11-12 million who are living here, my priorities are to deport violent criminals, terrorists, and anyone who threatens our safety. So I do not have the same policy as the current administration does. I think it's important that we move to our comprehensive immigration reform, but at the same time, stop the raids, stop the round-ups, stop the deporting of people who are living here doing their lives, doing their jobs, and that's my priority.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 RAMOS: But again, yes or no, can you promise tonight that you won't deport children, children who are already here?\par \par \uc2 CLINTON: I will not deport children. I would not deport children. I do not want to deport family members, either, Jorge.\par \par \uc2 Ramos then posed the same question to Sanders, who began by criticizing Clinton's response but eventually came around to this: "No, I will not deport children from the United States of America."\par \par \uc2 It was a little unorthodox for a moderator to make such a value-laden inquiry \u8212\'20\'14\u160\'00\'A0almost like something you'd expect from a protester at a rally. Voters who prefer a more conventionally neutral tone are certainly entitled to gripe here.\par \par \uc2 But I didn't mind Ramos's style. Yes, he was there to moderate\u160\'00\'A0\u8212\'20\'14 along with Univision colleague\u160\'00\'A0Maria Elena Salinas and Washington Post reporter Karen Tumulty\u160\'00\'A0\u8212\'20\'14 but Ramos also was there to be a voice of Latinos. I viewed his as something of a hybrid role, akin to the one filled by conservative commentators Hugh Hewitt and\u160\'00\'A0Mary Katharine Ham in Republican debates. Hewitt and Ham's job was to pose questions (they were panelists, not moderators) but also to represent an important subset of the electorate. Same goes for Ramos.\par \par \uc2 Come to think of it, Hewitt has sought pledges\u160\'00\'A0during debates, too. At a December event, he asked \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  if he would "abide by the decision of the Republicans" and not mount an independent White House bid, should he lose out on the GOP nomination. Trump vowed that he would. And at a February debate, Hewitt asked Trump whether he would "commit to voters tonight that religious liberty will be an absolute litmus test for anyone you appoint, not just to the Supreme Court, but to all courts." Again, Trump said yes.\par \par \uc2 In both cases, it seemed clear that there was a "right" answer in Hewitt's mind. But that was okay because he was speaking for many conservatives who felt the same way.\par \par \uc2 Similarly, Ramos on Wednesday was speaking for many Latinos who feel, as he seems to, that children should not be deported.\par \par \uc2 Even if you weren't a fan of his approach, you have to give him this: Ramos got yes-or-no answers from both candidates\u160\'00\'A0\u8212\'20\'14 a small miracle from two professional politicians who aren't always easy to pin down.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020160310ec3a002uu\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 the-fix\par {\*\bkmkstart toc82}{\*\bkmkend toc82}\b \uc2 Winners and losers from the Washington Post/Univision Democratic debate\b0\par\par\uc2 By Aaron Blake   \par \uc2 1,048 \uc2 words\par \uc2 10 March 2016\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  and Bernie Sanders clashed in a debate sponsored by The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2  and \uc2 Univision\uc2  on Wednesday night, the day after a win in the Michigan primary breathed new life into Sanders's underdog campaign.\par \par \uc2 The duel in Miami was the final\u160\'00\'A0one on the schedule (for now, at least) and gave the candidates their last, best chance to set a course for the rest of the race with a national audience watching.\par \par \uc2 How did they do?\u160\'00\'A0Below are our winners and losers.\par \par \uc2 WINNERS\par \par \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 : This debate was a minefield for her. She was coming off a disappointing loss in Michigan that gave Sanders some momentum. She got asked about possibly being indicted (!), about whether she lied about Benghazi and about about her being seen as untrustworthy. And the moderators demanded answers. Clinton avoided a disaster and came out as the better debater, yet again. And despite a couple missteps -- she STILL doesn't have a good answer on her Wall Street speeches?!? -- she had some very strong moments that will likely endure more than anything else.\par \par \uc2 When asked about her poor honesty ratings and her not-so-great public image, she had this to say: "I am not a natural politician, in case you haven't noticed, like my husband or President Obama." She added: "This is not easy for me." It was self-aware, and it turned a question about her not being honest into an answer in which she was uniquely\u160\'00\'A0candid.\u160\'00\'A0And then there was the moment she was speaking directly to a woman whose family had been broken up via deportation. \uc2 Univision\uc2  's Enrique Acevedo translated Clinton's heartfelt, slowly spoken answer in this indelible image, with Clinton\u160\'00\'A0featuring in a small splitscreen most of the time (though not in this particular image):\par \par \uc2 Can't get this image out of my mind. pic.twitter.com/FDw1VD0EHN\par \par \uc2 Bernie Sanders's suit: The man wore a BROWN SUIT. (Or maybe it was blue? No. No, it was brown.) This was basically all anybody could talk about on social media for the first 10 minutes. The Fix is on-record in support of non-traditional fashion choices. Think: \uc2 Marco Rubio\uc2  's boots. And President Obama's tan suit. We have seen way too many political men wearing blue and charcoal suits over the years, and Sanders boldly went where no presidential candidate has gone before ... er, at least in a long time. One issue, though, Bernie: No more button-down collars. They should only be worn sans tie.\par \par \uc2 Ted Kennedy: When it comes to a Democratic primary with a premium on getting to the left, the liberal lion of the Senate is bound to get some mentions. He was basically the Democrats' own version of Ronald Reagan on Wednesday night, as Clinton recalled the immigration reform he spearheaded in 2007. Clinton noted that Sanders opposed the bill -- suggesting a guilt-by-lack-of-association with Kennedy. Sanders, meanwhile, assured us twice that Kennedy was a very "close friend."\par \par \uc2 Moderators: Look, Clinton supporters and Clinton herself won't like the fact that Jorge Ramos asked the former secretary of state about being indicted. And they probably really won't like that he pressed her for a firmer "yes" or "no" on whether she would deport\u160\'00\'A0\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  children. But this debate featured something that is often lacking in debates -- follow-ups that demand firm positions. Ramos and The Post's own Karen Tumulty regularly pressed the two candidates when they didn't give a solid answer, trying to get an affirmative or a negative. It's not easy, but every moderator should do this. Candidates obfuscate way too much.\par \par \uc2 LOSERS\par \par \uc2 Sanders's chances at the nomination: As noted above, this was the last debate we currently have scheduled. This was Sanders's chance, after a big win in Michigan, to change the course of the race. And he was aggressive. He tried. He's getting better. He even handled a very tough question (in South Florida, no less) about his past praise for Fidel Castro. But he didn't do anything to change the fact that Clinton remains the overwhelming favorite to win the Democratic nomination. Sanders will likely continue to amass delegates and win some states, but he still needs that game-changer to really make this a race. He didn't get it on Wednesday night. And one wonders\u160\'00\'A0where else it might come from.\par \par \uc2 Clinton's attacks: Clinton attacked Sanders in a series of ways that are, well, pretty\u160\'00\'A0disingenuous. After attacking him for being against the auto bailout at Sunday's debate -- he voted for it\u160\'00\'A0but was against the bank bailout\u160\'00\'A0-- Clinton doubled down on some similarly odd lines of attack Wednesday. She tied him to Republicans for opposing Ted Kennedy's immigration bill and suggested he supports the anti-\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  Minutemen. She noted a Koch brothers group is running an ad thanking Sanders for voting against the \uc2 Export-Import Bank\uc2  . And she (yet again) suggested he's trying to undo Obamacare by replacing it with single-payer health care. In each case, it's as if Clinton is painting Sanders as an ally of Republicans. In each case, that's just not true. Mostly, he's taking these positions because he's further to the left than most Democrats. Peter Hamby said it well:\par \par \uc2 Being a senator: Just in case you forgot that being a senator is not a great thing when it comes to becoming president, this debate should disavow you of that. Voting on large packages allows your opponents to pick out one thing that you might or might not support or oppose, and tar you with it over and over again. Plus, you are constantly weighing in on the issues of the day in your public comments. Immigration is case in point.

All Rights Reserved \par \par \uc2 RICHMOND - Amid the national debate over illegal immigration, several Republican lawmakers in Virginia are trying to tighten the state's already aggressive stance.\par \par \uc2 Three Republican legislators have pitched separate bills aiming to crack down on people living in Virginia who are in the United States illegally.\par \par \uc2 Del. Robert G. Marshall (R-Prince William) wants to make sure cities and counties comply with federal immigration detainers, which usually are requests to local law enforcement officials to hold jailed individuals beyond their release dates while federal agents decide whether to begin the deportation process.\par \par \uc2 State \uc2 Sen. Richard H. Black\uc2  (R-Loudoun) has a bill that would hold cities legally responsible if officials release an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who then commits a crime.\par \par \uc2 And state Sen. Thomas A. Garrett Jr. (R-Buckingham) wants to prohibit "sanctuary cities," a term for communities that try to block illegal immigrants from being turned over to federal authorities.\par \par \uc2 "It's the role of the states to tell the federal government to do their damn job," said Garrett, who is running for Congress. "Obama, Congress, the entire federal government is pretending there's nothing to see here."\par \par \uc2 Compromise legislation will come before lawmakers for final votes in the last week of the legislative session, which begins Monday, and it is unclear whether amended versions of some of the measures will pass. But the debate has tapped into a national concern about illegal immigration voiced by Republican presidential front-runner \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Also fueling worry is the 2015 high-profile shooting death in San Francisco of 32-year-old Kate Steinle, allegedly by a Mexican national who had previously been deported five times.\par \par \uc2 Lawmakers also cited the terrorist attacks in Paris last year and said they had concerns that Syrian refugees fleeing the \uc2 Islamic State\uc2  would export terrorism to the United States through federal resettlement programs.\par \par \uc2 Similar laws were put forward this legislative session in Florida, Arizona, Nebraska, Kansas and Wisconsin, according to \uc2 Church World Service\uc2 , which tracks what it calls anti-sanctuary-city bills. So far, only North Carolina has enacted such a law.\par \par \uc2 "Unfortunately, this really is a symptom of the discriminatory rhetoric in this election cycle targeting immigrants and Syrian refugees," said the Rev. Noel Andersen, the national grass-roots coordinator for CWS. "The anti-immigrant, anti-refugee, anti-Muslim organizations have taken this opportunity to join forces."\par \par \uc2 Opponents say the measures could discourage victims from reporting crimes because they fear deportation and might undermine efforts by \uc2 Gov. Terry McAuliffe\uc2  (D) to portray Virginia as open to newcomers, thereby hurting the state's economy.\par \par \uc2 Sen. Scott A. Surovell (D-Fairfax) said the bills are part of a trend first seen in Virginia in 2007 when Prince William County directed police officers to check the immigration status of people if there was probable cause to believe that they were in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 "We can continue to send that kind of message," he said in a floor speech. "We can continue to say that Virginia's not open . . . that Virginia doesn't like people that don't look like us or people that don't share our values."\par \par \uc2 But Del. David B. Albo (R-Fairfax) said illegal immigration puts too much of a strain on public safety and other resources. He said he began to work on the issue after a dozen of his constituents were killed in the Sept. 11, 2001, attack on the Pentagon.\par \par \uc2 "I would venture to say we have about every single law that you can have in Virginia to fight illegal immigration," he said. For example, Virginia already requires law enforcement to check the immigration status of every person who is arrested.\par \par \uc2 Ever since Virginia Attorney General Mark R. Herring (D) issued an opinion last year declaring federal detainer requests optional, lawmakers have looked for ways to make them mandatory.\par \par \uc2 Albo, chairman of the House Courts of Justice Committee that hears these bills, said consensus was building around new language that would require sheriffs to comply with "lawful detainers" before an inmate's release date, on the condition that federal officers promise to pick up detainees or pay for their stay.\par \par \uc2 That is already what happens in Arlington County, according to Paul Larson, chief deputy at the county sheriff's office. If \uc2 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2  makes a detainer request, the federal agency pays for food and medical care and picks them up within 48 hours.\par \par \uc2 "If they didn't, we would release them," he said. "They have not missed a person."\par \par \uc2 As in Arlington, Virginia Beach Sheriff Ken Stolle, a former Republican state senator, said he will not hold anyone past their release date without a judge's order.\par \par \uc2 "Last thing they want is law enforcement making decisions about who should be held and who should not be held," he said. "There's due process. There's a court system for that."\par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com \par \par \uc2 WP20160306vasanctuary0306\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020160306ec360005p\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 RICHMOND \u8212\'20\'14 Amid the national debate over illegal immigration, several Republican lawmakers in Virginia are trying to tighten the state's already aggressive stance.\par \par \uc2 Three Republican legislators have pitched separate bills aiming to crack down on people living in Virginia who are in the United States illegally.\par \par \uc2 Del. Robert G. Marshall (R-Prince William) wants to make sure cities and counties comply with federal immigration detainers, which usually are requests to local law enforcement officials to hold jailed individuals beyond their release dates while federal agents decide whether to begin the deportation process.\par \par \uc2 State \uc2 Sen. Richard H. Black\uc2  (R-Loudoun) has a bill that would hold cities legally responsible if officials release an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who then commits a crime.\par \par \uc2 And state Sen. Thomas A. Garrett Jr. (R-Buckingham) wants to prohibit "sanctuary cities," a term for communities that try to block illegal immigrants from being turned over to federal authorities.\par \par \uc2 "It's the role of the states to tell the federal government to do their damn job," said Garrett, who is running for Congress. "Obama, Congress, the entire federal government is pretending there's nothing to see here."\par \par \uc2 Compromise legislation will come before lawmakers for final votes in the last week of the legislative session, which begins Monday, and it is unclear whether amended versions of some of the measures will pass. But the debate has tapped into a national concern about illegal immigration voiced by Republican presidential front-runner \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Also fueling worry is the 2015 high-profile shooting death in San Francisco of 32-year-old Kate Steinle, allegedly by a Mexican national who had previously been deported five times.\par \par \uc2 Lawmakers also cited the terrorist attacks in Paris last year and said they had concerns that Syrian refugees fleeing the \uc2 Islamic State\uc2  would export terrorism to the United States through federal resettlement programs.\par \par \uc2 Similar laws were put forward this legislative session in Florida, Arizona, Nebraska, Kansas and Wisconsin, according to \uc2 Church World Service\uc2 , which tracks what it calls anti-sanctuary-city bills. So far, only North Carolina has enacted such a law.\par \par \uc2 "Unfortunately, this really is a symptom of the discriminatory rhetoric in this election cycle targeting immigrants and Syrian refugees," said the Rev. Noel \u173\'00\'ADAndersen, the national grass-roots coordinator for CWS. "The anti-immigrant, anti-refugee, \u173\'00\'ADanti-Muslim organizations have taken this opportunity to join forces."\par \par \uc2 Opponents say the measures could discourage victims from reporting crimes because they fear deportation and might undermine efforts by \uc2 Gov. Terry McAuliffe\uc2  (D) to portray Virginia as open to newcomers, thereby hurting the state's economy.\par \par \uc2 Sen. Scott A. Surovell (D-Fairfax) said the bills are part of a trend first seen in Virginia in 2007 when Prince William County directed police officers to check the immigration status of people if there was probable cause to believe that they were in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 "We can continue to send that kind of message," he said in a floor speech. "We can continue to say that Virginia's not open .\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09. that Virginia doesn't like people that don't look like us or people that don't share our values."\par \par \uc2 But Del. David B. Albo (R-Fairfax) said illegal immigration puts too much of a strain on public safety and other resources. He said he began to work on the issue after a dozen of his constituents were killed in the Sept.\u160\'00\'A011, 2001, attack on the Pentagon.\par \par \uc2 "I would venture to say we have about every single law that you can have in Virginia to fight illegal immigration," he said. For example, Virginia already requires law enforcement to check the immigration status of every person who is arrested.\par \par \uc2 Ever since Virginia Attorney General Mark R. Herring (D) issued an opinion last year declaring federal detainer requests optional, lawmakers have looked for ways to make them mandatory.\par \par \uc2 Albo, chairman of the House Courts of Justice Committee that hears these bills, said consensus was building around new language that would require sheriffs to comply with "lawful detainers" before an inmate's release date, on the condition that federal officers promise to pick up detainees or pay for their stay.\par \par \uc2 That is already what happens in Arlington County, according to Paul Larson, chief deputy at the county sheriff's office. If \uc2 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2  makes a detainer request, the federal agency pays for food and medical care and picks them up within 48\u160\'00\'A0hours.\par \par \uc2 "If they didn't, we would release them," he said. "They have not missed a person."\par \par \uc2 As in Arlington, Virginia Beach Sheriff Ken Stolle, a former Republican state senator, said he will not hold anyone past their release date without a judge's order.\par \par \uc2 "Last thing they want is law enforcement making decisions about who should be held and who should not be held," he said. "There's due process. There's a court system for that."\par \par \uc2 jenna.portnoy@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020160306ec360008e\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 LEESPORT, Pa. \u8212\'20\'14 The latest battleground in the raging national war over illegal immigration is a quiet, red-brick compound in central Pennsylvania, surrounded by woods, fields and a playground with swings and jungle gyms.\par \par \uc2 Inside are 96 women and children who fled violence-plagued Central America last year and crossed into the United States without permission. They are being held by \uc2 U.S. immigration authorities\uc2  while fighting to win asylum, at a time when illegal immigration has inflamed the presidential race and President Obama's attempt to shield millions from deportation is stuck in the nation's highest court.\par \par \uc2 To immigrant advocates, the Berks Family Residential Facility is a prison where children and their parents are being unjustly confined. They have pressed for months to have it shut down, and celebrated last month when the state of Pennsylvania decided to revoke its license.\par \par \uc2 To federal immigration officials, who have appealed the state's order, the unfenced center is both a protective environment for families and a showcase of U.S. determination to curb illegal border crossings. By keeping the families in custody, officials hope to set an example and prevent a recurrence of the 2014 border crisis, during which tens of thousands of Central American minors and families surged into the United States.\par \par \uc2 "This has been an awkward dilemma for the government," said \uc2 Muzaffar Chishti\uc2 , an official at the nonpartisan \uc2 Migration Policy Institute\uc2  in New York. "Family detention is a delicate issue, and the interplay between trying to balance immigration policy goals, social services for kids and the law has made a controversial and potent mixture."\par \par \uc2 The fight over how to handle the border flow has dragged on for two years, with lawsuits and court rulings, executive actions and congressional pushback.\par \par \uc2 In January, armed agents in Georgia, North Carolina and several other states swept up 121 mothers and children who were awaiting deportation, arousing a furor among Democrats in Congress and liberal advocacy groups.\par \par \uc2 Now, the spotlight has shifted to Berks, one of three U.S. facilities where the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency holds \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  families. The other two are larger compounds in Texas, originally built as military barracks or security training camps.\par \par \uc2 Rights groups have filed complaints of poor medical services, intrusive security and other problems. \uc2 The American Civil Liberties Union\uc2  sued on behalf of 29 detained families, saying that they were denied an adequate chance to prove that they deserve permanent asylum from violence in their homelands.\par \par \uc2 Ultimately, the state revoked the facility's license on a technicality, finding that it had been originally built to house children but not adults. Advocates argue that newly arrived children suffer special hardship in detention and cannot legally be kept there either, based on a 1997 court ruling that was reaffirmed last summer.\par \par \uc2 "The government is only keeping these families here to send a message and deter others from coming," said Carol Anne Donohoe, a lawyer for many Berks families. "No child should be in detention, and every one of these families has relatives waiting to receive them."\par \par \uc2 Officials at the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2 , which oversees ICE, said they could not comment on specific disputes involving Berks.\par \par \uc2 But they defended the practice of detaining and deporting most Central American families who are caught soon after entering the United States, calling it part of a strategy adopted in 2014 after a wave of 60,000 unaccompanied children and 26,000 families reached the border. Officials say they will keep up the pressure, carrying out the raids in January and announcing plans to open refu\u173\'00\'ADgee processing centers in Central America.\par \par \uc2 "We cannot send a message that once families with kids cross the border, they are here to stay," a senior DHS official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity as a matter of department policy. "If many end up staying here indefinitely, the concern is that it will encourage further illegal immigration."\par \par \uc2 The fate of the families at Berks could hinge on a legal fight over whether special rights granted to children who reach the United States alone should also apply to a parent who comes with them.\par \par \uc2 In 2000, a law to protect smuggling victims required that many unaccompanied, undocumented minors be given shelter and a chance to seek permanent refuge. In 1997, a federal judge ruled in a lawsuit that such children may be detained only briefly and in the least-restrictive conditions.\par \par \uc2 The recent border surge, which included numerous family groups, created a legal and ethical quandary over where to keep those immigrants and what laws to apply.\par \par \uc2 Advocacy groups decried the harsh conditions of family detention centers near the border, and a federal judge ruled that the law limiting detention for illegal minors should also apply to their accompanying parents. The government appealed, and the case is now before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit in San Francisco.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18I am not a criminal\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 An unusual spectacle unfolded outside Berks one recent morning. About 100 people gathered on the driveway, including church volunteers, lawyers, Latino activists and at least one relative of a family being held at the facility. The crowd chanted "Libertad, libertad!" and raised posters demanding that everyone inside be released.\par \par \uc2 About 20 feet away, 96 Central American women and children stood under a tree, facing the visitors. Some of the children wore signs with the number of months they had been detained.\par \par \uc2 A few uniformed police officers kept the two groups apart, but they called out to each other with increasing boldness.\par \par \uc2 "I am not a criminal. I don't want to be locked up here anymore," a 9-year-old girl shouted in Spanish.\par \par \uc2 "We are with you," a protester shouted back. "You will be free soon."\par \par \uc2 Several days later, a Washington Post reporter returned to Berks to meet with two of the mothers, a rare visit permitted by ICE. The rooms were clean and bright, with bunk beds and piles of toys. A staff member remained within earshot during the visit.\par \par \uc2 The mothers, both from El Salvador, said their children were taking classes in math and English and had access to computers. But they also said months of confinement had taken an emotional toll. They were desperate to leave Berks and stay with relatives while waiting for their asylum claims to be reviewed.\par \par \uc2 "My son is sad, and sometimes he cries at night," said one woman, 29, whose attorneys asked that she be identified only as Sarai. "He keeps asking me why we are here, and I have no answer for him."\par \par \uc2 Immigration officers at Berks have been advising mothers that there is one easy escape route available. Each time one requests medical help, saying she or her children are suffering from stress or sickness, she receives a reply suggesting that she ask her attorney to withdraw the motion to suspend the family's deportation.\par \par \uc2 In that case, the reply says, "arrangements can be made for your removal from the United States."\par \par \uc2 pamela.constable@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020160305ec350053d\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved   \par \par \uc2 LEESPORT, Pa. - The latest battleground in the raging national war over illegal immigration is a quiet, red-brick compound in central Pennsylvania, surrounded by woods, fields and a playground with swings and jungle gyms.\par \par \uc2 Inside are 96 women and children who fled violence-plagued Central America last year and crossed into the United States without permission. They are being held by \uc2 U.S. immigration authorities\uc2  while fighting to win asylum, at a time when illegal immigration has inflamed the presidential race and President Obama's attempt to shield millions from deportation is stuck in the nation's highest court.\par \par \uc2 To immigrant advocates, the Berks Family Residential Facility is a prison where children and their parents are being unjustly confined. They have pressed for months to have it shut down, and celebrated last month when the state of Pennsylvania decided to revoke its license.\par \par \uc2 To federal immigration officials, who have appealed the state's order, the unfenced center is both a protective environment for families and a showcase of U.S. determination to curb illegal border crossings. By keeping the families in custody, officials hope to set an example and prevent a recurrence of the 2014 border crisis, during which tens of thousands of Central American minors and families surged into the United States.\par \par \uc2 "This has been an awkward dilemma for the government," said \uc2 Muzaffar Chishti\uc2 , an official at the nonpartisan \uc2 Migration Policy Institute\uc2  in New York. "Family detention is a delicate issue, and the interplay between trying to balance immigration policy goals, social services for kids and the law has made a controversial and potent mixture."\par \par \uc2 Detention as a deterrent\par \par \uc2 The fight over how to handle the border flow has dragged on for two years, with lawsuits and court rulings, executive actions and congressional pushback.\par \par \uc2 In January, armed agents in Georgia, North Carolina and several other states swept up 121 mothers and children who were awaiting deportation, arousing a furor among Democrats in Congress and liberal advocacy groups.\par \par \uc2 Now, the spotlight has shifted to Berks, one of three U.S. facilities where the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency holds \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  families. The other two are larger compounds in Texas, originally built as military barracks or security training camps.\par \par \uc2 Rights groups have filed complaints of poor medical services, intrusive security and other problems. \uc2 The American Civil Liberties Union\uc2  sued on behalf of 29 detained families, saying that they were denied an adequate chance to prove that they deserve permanent asylum from violence in their homelands.\par \par \uc2 Ultimately, the state revoked the facility's license on a technicality, finding that it had been originally built to house children but not adults. Advocates argue that newly arrived children suffer special hardship in detention and cannot legally be kept there either, based on a 1997 court ruling that was reaffirmed last summer.\par \par \uc2 "The government is only keeping these families here to send a message and deter others from coming," said Carol Anne Donohoe, a lawyer for many Berks families. "No child should be in detention, and every one of these families has relatives waiting to receive them."\par \par \uc2 Officials at the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2 , which oversees ICE, said they could not comment on specific disputes involving Berks.\par \par \uc2 But they defended the practice of detaining and deporting most Central American families who are caught soon after entering the United States, calling it part of a strategy adopted in 2014 after a wave of 60,000 unaccompanied children and 26,000 families reached the border. Officials say they will keep up the pressure, carrying out the raids in January and announcing plans to open refugee processing centers in Central America.\par \par \uc2 "We cannot send a message that once families with kids cross the border, they are here to stay," a senior DHS official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity as a matter of department policy. "If many end up staying here indefinitely, the concern is that it will encourage further illegal immigration."\par \par \uc2 The fate of the families at Berks could hinge on a legal fight over whether special rights granted to children who reach the United States alone should also apply to a parent who comes with them.\par \par \uc2 In 2000, a law to protect smuggling victims required that many unaccompanied, undocumented minors be given shelter and a chance to seek permanent refuge. In 1997, a federal judge ruled in a lawsuit that such children may be detained only briefly and in the least-restrictive conditions.\par \par \uc2 The recent border surge, which included numerous family groups, created a legal and ethical quandary over where to keep those immigrants and what laws to apply.\par \par \uc2 Advocacy groups decried the harsh conditions of family detention centers near the border, and a federal judge ruled that the law limiting detention for illegal minors should also apply to their accompanying parents. The government appealed, and the case is now before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit in San Francisco.\par \par \uc2 An unusual spectacle unfolded outside Berks one recent morning. About 100 people gathered on the driveway, including church volunteers, lawyers, Latino activists and at least one relative of a family being held at the facility. The crowd chanted "Libertad, libertad!" and raised posters demanding that everyone inside be released.\par \par \uc2 About 20 feet away, 96 Central American women and children stood under a tree, facing the visitors. Some of the children wore signs with the number of months they had been detained.\par \par \uc2 A few uniformed police officers kept the two groups apart, but they called out to each other with increasing boldness.\par \par \uc2 "I am not a criminal. I don't want to be locked up here anymore," a 9-year-old girl shouted in Spanish.\par \par \uc2 "We are with you," a protester shouted back. "You will be free soon."\par \par \uc2 Several days later, a Washington Post reporter returned to Berks to meet with two of the mothers, a rare visit permitted by ICE. The rooms were clean and bright, with bunk beds and piles of toys. A staff member remained within earshot during the visit.\par \par \uc2 The mothers, both from El Salvador, said their children were taking classes in math and English and had access to computers. But they also said months of confinement had taken an emotional toll. They were desperate to leave Berks and stay with relatives while waiting for their asylum claims to be reviewed.\par \par \uc2 "My son is sad, and sometimes he cries at night," said one woman, 29, whose attorneys asked that she be identified only as Sarai. "He keeps asking me why we are here, and I have no answer for him."\par \par \uc2 Immigration officers at Berks have been advising mothers that there is one easy escape route available. Each time one requests medical help, saying she or her children are suffering from stress or sickness, she receives a reply suggesting that she ask her attorney to withdraw the motion to suspend the family's deportation.\par \par \uc2 In that case, the reply says, "arrangements can be made for your removal from the United States."\par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com\par \par \uc2 WP20160306familycenters0306\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020160306ec360000f\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The four Republican candidates trailing \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  faced him in Houston Thursday night in the last debate before the Super Tuesday primaries next week.\par \par \uc2 We posted the complete transcript below. Washington Post reporters and readers using Genius have annotated it, and will continue to do so following the debate.\par \par \uc2 To see an annotation, click or tap the highlighted part of the transcript; if you would like to leave your own annotations, make sure you have a Genius account. Post staff annotations will appear by default; others are in a menu that you can see in the upper right when you click or tap on an annotation.\par \par \uc2 CNN's Wolf Blitzer introduced the candidates, laid out the rules and the debate began.\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: It's time for the candidates to introduce themselves right now. You'll each have 30 seconds. Dr. Carson, you're first.\par \par \uc2 CARSON: If someone had tried to describe today's America to you 30 years ago, you would have listened in disbelief. Americans know that our nation is heading off the abyss of destruction, secondary to divisiveness, fiscal irresponsibility, and failure to lead.\par \par \uc2 Marco, Donald, Ted, John, we will not solve any of these problems by trying to destroy each other. What we need to do is be looking for solutions tonight. It's not about us, it's about the American people.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Governor Kasich?\par \par \uc2 KASICH: Well, you know, on the way over here, even getting ready earlier and sitting in the green room and watching the early coverage, you know, my father carried mail on his back and his father was a coal miner and my mother's mother was an immigrant, could barely speak English. And I'm standing on this stage. It's pretty remarkable. But I want to tell you, there's a lot of young people watching tonight. You can do whatever you want to do in your life. America is an amazing country, where a kid like me can grow up to run for president of the United States and be on this stage tonight. So to all the young people that are out there, your hopes, your dreams, pursue them. Shoot for the stars. America's great, and you can do it. Thank you, Wolf.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Senator Rubio?\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: Well, thank you. This election, we have to decide the identity of America in the 2ist century, but as part of this primary, we have to find out our identity as a party and as a movement.\par \par \uc2 Thirty-six years ago, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush began the Reagan Revolution. For a generation, they defined conservatism as limited government and free enterprise and a strong national defense. But they also appealed to our hopes and our dreams. Now we have to decide if we are still that kind of party and still that kind of movement, or if we're simply going to become a party that preys on people's angers and fears.\par \par \uc2 I hope we remain that conservative movement that appeals to our hopes and our dreams and the belief that America will always be better in its future than it's been in its story history.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Senator Cruz?\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: Welcome to Texas.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Here, Texas provided my family with hope. Here, my mom became the first in her family ever to go to college. Here, my dad fled Cuba and washed dishes, making 50 cents an hour to pay his way through the University of Texas. I graduated from high school at Second Baptist not too far away from here.\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: When I ran for Senate, I promised 27 million Texans I would fight for you every day, and not for the Washington bosses.\par \par \uc2 And, I'll tell you, as I travel the state, Democrats tell me I didn't vote for you, but you're doing what you said you would do. And, as president, I will do the same.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Mr. Trump.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Thank you. My whole theme is make America great again. We don't win anymore as a country. We don't win with trade, we don't win with the military. ISIS, we can't even knock out ISIS, and we will, believe me. We will.\par \par \uc2 We don't win in any capacity with healthcare. We have terrible health care, Obamacare is going to be repealed and replaced. We just don't win.\par \par \uc2 You look at our borders, they're like swiss cheese, everybody pours in.\par \par \uc2 We're going to make a great country again. We're going to start winning again. We're going to win a lot, it's going to be a big difference, believe me. It's going to be a big difference.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Thank you very much. It's now time to begin questions. Voters in the first four states have spoken, and Mr. Trump has emerged as the frontrunner, but in five days the candidates will face their biggest test yet, Super Tuesday. When nearly half of the delegates needed to win the Republican nomination will be awarded, and the biggest prize of the night is Texas.\par \par \uc2 Immigration is a key issue in this state, for all voters nationwide, including the many people watching us on Telemundo. So, that's where we begin.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump, you've called for a deportation force to remove the 11 million undocumented immigrants from the United States. You've also promised to let what you call, "the good ones", come back in. Your words, "the good ones", after they've been deported.\par \par \uc2 Senator Cruz would not allow them to come back in. He says that's the biggest difference between the two of you. He calls your plan amnesty. Is it?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: First of all, he was in charge of amnesty, he was the leader, and you can ask Marco because they've been debating this every debate that we've had.\par \par \uc2 As far as coming back in, number one, you wouldn't even be talking, and you wouldn't have asked that as the first question if it weren't for me when my opening when I talked about illegals immigration. It wouldn't even be a big subject.\par \par \uc2 But, we either have a country, or we don't have a country. We have at least 11 million people in this country that came in illegally. They will go out. They will come back -- some will come back, the best, through a process. They have to come back legally. They have to come back through a process, and it may not be a very quick process, but I think that's very fair, and very fine.\par \par \uc2 They're going to get in line with other people. The best of them will come back, but they're going to come back through a process.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Senator Cruz, what's wrong with letting what Mr. Trump calls, "the good ones" come back to the United States?\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: You know, the people that get forgotten in this debate over immigration are the hardworking men and women of this country -- our millions of Americans who are losing their jobs. Millions of legal immigrants who are losing their jobs are seeing their wages driven down.\par \par \uc2 You know, in the past couple of weeks the Wall Street Journal had a very interesting article about the state of Arizona. Arizona put in very tough laws on illegal immigration, and the result was illegal immigrants fled the state, and what's happened there -- it was a very interesting article.\par \par \uc2 Some of the business owners complained that the wages they had to pay workers went up, and from their perspective that was a bad thing. But, what the state of Arizona has seen is the dollars they're spending on welfare, on prisons, and education, all of those have dropped by hundreds of millions of dollars. And, the Americans, and for that matter, the legal immigrants who are in Arizona, are seeing unemployment drop are seeing wages rise. That's who we need to be fighting for.\par \par \uc2 Listen, we have always welcomed legal immigrants, but I think it is a mistake to forgive those who break the law to allow them to become U.S. citizens, and that's why I've led the fight against granting citizenship to those here illegally, and that's why I will do the same thing as president.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Mr. Trump, do you want to respond to that? TRUMP: Well, I'm very glad that Ted mentioned Arizona because probably the toughest man on borders is Sheriff Joe Arpaio, and two days ago he totally endorsed me, so, thank you.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Senator Rubio?\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: Senator Cruz has called your immigration plan amnesty, and has an add out there comparing it to President Obama's. He says both of you support allowing undocumented immigrants legal status here in the United States after a background check, paying a fine, and paying taxes.\par \par \uc2 Are those claims correct?\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: Well, first of all, and before we do anything, I've been abundantly clear on this. When I'm president of the United States, before we do anything on immigration, we are going to secure the border. And, that's not just the physical border with Mexico, it's Visa overstays. That's 45 percent of the problem right there.\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: It also has to do -- that's why we need e-verify, and entry-exit tracking system, and so-forth. And, until that happens, we're not doing anything else. And then we'll see what the American people are willing to support.\par \par \uc2 And Donald mentioned, because he mentioned me in his answer, that his position on immigration is what has driven this debate. Well, the truth is, though, that a lot of these positions that he's now taking are new to him.\par \par \uc2 In 2011, he talked about the need for a pathway to citizenship. In 2012, Donald criticized Mitt Romney, saying that Mitt lost his election because of self-deportation.\par \par \uc2 And so even today, we saw a report in one of the newspapers that Donald, you've hired a significant number of people from other countries to take jobs that Americans could have filled.\par \par \uc2 My mom and dad -- my mom was a maid at a hotel, and instead of hiring an American like her, you have brought in over a thousand people from all over the world to fill those jobs instead.\par \par \uc2 So I think this is an important issue. And I think we are realizing increasingly that it's an important issue for the country that has been debated for 30 years, but finally needs to be solved once and for all.\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Mr. Trump?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Well, first of all, self-deportation is people are going to leave as soon as they see others going out. If you look at Dwight Eisenhower in the 1950s, they started moving people out and the rest of them left.\par \par \uc2 Self-deportation, as I really define it, and that's the way I define it, is you're going to get some to go, and the rest are going to go out.\par \par \uc2 As far as the people that I've hired in various parts of Florida during the absolute prime season, like Palm Beach and other locations, you could not get help. It's the up season. People didn't want to have part-time jobs. There were part-time jobs, very seasonal, 90-day jobs, 120-day jobs, and you couldn't get.\par \par \uc2 Everybody agrees with me on that. They were part-time jobs. You needed them, or we just might as well close the doors, because you couldn't get help in those hot, hot sections of Florida.\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: That -- my point that I made was you had criticized Mitt Romney for self-deportation. You said that his strategy of self- deportation is why he lost the election.\par \par \uc2 And I think people in Florida would be surprised, because, in fact, the article that was today, they interviewed a number of people that would have been willing to do those jobs, if you would have been willing to hire them to do it.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I criticized Mitt Romney for losing the election. He should have won that election. He had a failed president. He ran a terrible campaign. He was a terrible candidate. That's what I criticize Mitt Romney -- I mean, ran...\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: No, he...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Excuse me. He ran one terrible campaign. That's an election that should have been won.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: Well, in fact, I agree we should have won and I wished we would have, but, in fact, you did criticize him for using the term "self-deportation." I mean, that's on the record and people can look it up right now online.\par \par \uc2 But, again, I just want to reiterate, I think it's really important, this point. I think it's fine, it's an important point that you raise and we discuss on immigration. This is a big issue for Texas, a huge issue for the country.\par \par \uc2 But I also think that if you're going to claim that you're the only one that lifted this into the campaign, that you acknowledge that, for example, you're only person on this stage that has ever been fined for hiring people to work on your projects illegally.\par \par \uc2 You hired some workers from Poland...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: No, no, I'm the only one on the stage that's hired people. You haven't hired anybody.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: In fact, some of the people...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: And by the way, I've hired -- and by the way, I've hired tens of thousands of people over at my job. You've hired nobody.\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: Yes, you've hired a thousand from another country...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: You've had nothing but problems with your credit cards, et cetera. So don't tell me about that.\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: Let me just say -- let me finish the statement. This is important.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: You haven't hired one person, you liar.\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: He hired workers from Poland. And he had to pay a million dollars or so in a judgment from...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: That's wrong. That's wrong. Totally wrong.\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: That's a fact. People can look it up. I'm sure people are Googling it right now. Look it up. "Trump Polish workers," you'll see a million dollars for hiring illegal workers on one of his projects. He did it.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: That happened.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I've hired tens of thousands of people over my lifetime. Tens of thousands...\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: Many from other countries instead of hiring Americans.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Be quiet. Just be quiet.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Let me talk. I've hired tens of thousands of people. He brings up something from 30 years ago, it worked out very well. Everybody was happy.\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: You paid a million dollars.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: And by the way, the laws were totally different. That was a whole different world.\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Thank you.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: But I've hired people. Nobody up here has hired anybody.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Senator Cruz, you say you want to deport the 11 million undocumented immigrants, but you never want to allow them to come back to the United States. What would happen to the children who are U.S.- born citizens whose parent will be deported under your plan?\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: Well, existing law provides that those who are deported cannot come back here legally. U.S. citizens can come back. That's existing law.\par \par \uc2 But let me say, Wolf, I really find it amazing that Donald believes that he is the one who discovered the issue of illegal immigration. I can tell you, when I ran for Senate here in the state of Texas, I ran promising to lead the fight against amnesty, promising to fight to build a wall. And in 2013, when I was fight against the "gang of eight" amnesty bill, where was Donald? He was firing Dennis Rodman on "Celebrity Apprentice."\par \par \uc2 (LAUGHTER)\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: And indeed, if you look at the "gang of eight," one individual on this stage broke his promise to the men and women who elected him and wrote the amnesty bill.\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: If you look at the eight members of the Gang of Eight, Donald gave over $50,000 to three Democrats and two Republicans. And when you're funding open border politicians, you shouldn't be surprised when they fight for open borders.\par \par \uc2 And I think if you want to know who actually will secure the borders and follow through, you ought to ask who has a record before they were a candidate for president of fighting to secure the borders and stop amnesty. And I'm the only one on this stage that has that record. And by the way, Marco is exactly right that a federal court found Donald guilty of being part of a conspiracy to hire people illegally and entered a $1 million judgment against him.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Mr. Trump?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I can only say this, and I've said it loud and clear and I've said it for years. And many of these people are sitting right in the audience right now -- your lobbyist and your special interest and your donors, because the audience is packed with them, and they're packed with you.\par \par \uc2 I've had an amazing relationship with politicians -- with politicians both Democrat, Republican, because I was a businessman. As one magazine said, he's a world-class businessman; he was friendly with everybody. I got along with everybody.\par \par \uc2 You get along with nobody. You don't have one Republican -- you don't have one Republican senator, and you work with them every day of your life, although you skipped a lot of time. These are minor details. But you don't have one Republican senator backing you; not one. You don't have the endorsement of one Republican senator and you work with these people. You should be ashamed of yourself.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Senator Cruz?\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: You know, I actually think Donald is right. He is promising if he's elected he will go and cut deals in Washington. And he's right. He has supported -- he has given hundreds of thousands of dollars to Democrats. Anyone who really cared about illegal immigration wouldn't be hiring illegal immigrants. Anyone who really cared about illegal immigration wouldn't be funding Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi; wouldn't be funding the Gang of Eight. And, you know, he is right. When you stand up to Washington, when you honor the promise you made to the men and women who elected you and say enough with the corruption, enough with the cronyism, let's actually stand for the working men and women of this country, Washington doesn't like it.\par \par \uc2 And Donald, if you want to be liked in Washington, that's not a good attribute for a president.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Here's a man -- Robin Hood. This is Robin Hood over here. He talks about corruption. On his financial disclosure form, he didn't even put that he's borrowed money from Citibank and from \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2  , which is a total violation. He didn't talk about the fact that he pays almost no interest. He just left it off, and now he's going to protect the people from the big bad banks.\par \par \uc2 Give me a break.\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: All right. We're going to move on to Governor Kasich.\par \par \uc2 Governor Kasich...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: Wolf, can I respond to that attack?\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: You can respond, but let me get Governor Kasich in. He's been waiting patiently.\par \par \uc2 Governor Kasich, the idea -- you've said this, and I want to quote you now: "The idea that we're going to deport all these people is ludicrous and everybody knows it." Those are your words. Should people be allowed to break the law just because it's not feasible to stop them?\par \par \uc2 KASICH: Look, we have a great president here, George Bush, the 41st president of the United States. He worked with Ronald Reagan to pass an effort to try to solve this problem -- a path to legalization. You see, that was a time when things worked. It was a time when President Reagan and George Bush decided that we needed to make the country work.\par \par \uc2 Look, I think there is an answer here. The answer is you complete the border. You let people know that once it's done, you don't have a right to come in. If you come in, we don't want any excuse. You're going to go back. But I favor a guest worker program. I think it's practical. And I think for the 11 million or 11.5 million Americans -- the illegals that are here, if they have not committed a crime since they've been here, I'd make them pay a fine, some back taxes, maybe some community service. And at the end, I'd give them a path to legalization, but not a path to citizenship. I don't think we're going to tear families apart. I don't think we're going to ride around in people's neighborhoods and grab people out of their homes. I don't think -- first of all, I don't think it's practical and I don't think it reflects America.\par \par \uc2 You know what happened? The problem with President Reagan is we didn't get in there and actually finish the border. And I think it was probably business interests that affected it. But at the end of the day, let's be practical. Let's start solving problems in this country instead of kicking them upstairs. With President Reagan and George Bush, it was a bipartisan coalition to address the issue, and I think we can and should do it again. And I will have a plan in the first 100 days to get it done and get this issue behind us.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Thank you, Governor.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Dr. Carson, you've been critical of mass deportation. You said back in November you don't think Mr. Trump's plan necessarily represents the Republican Party. Given how well Mr. Trump has been doing with the Republican primary voters, do you still believe that?\par \par \uc2 CARSON: I believe in liberty and justice for all. I think everything that we do should be fair. And I've already described -- you know, how we can secure the border.\par \par \uc2 We need to secure all the borders, because it's not just people coming in from South America and Mexico, but there are terrorists who want to destroy us, who are getting across our borders fairly easily. And we have to stop that.\par \par \uc2 But in terms of the people who are here already, after we -- after we stop the illegal immigration, we need to be reasonable. And I would give them a six-month period in which to get registered as a guest worker, assuming that they have an acceptable record.\par \par \uc2 They have to pay a back-tax penalty, have to pay taxes going forward, but they don't have to live underground anymore. And I think they do not become American citizens, they do not vote.\par \par \uc2 If they want to become an American citizen, they go through exactly the same process that anybody else goes through. I think that's the kind of situation that is actually fair to people.\par \par \uc2 And we have other ways of -- of utilizing our facilities and our talents as foreign aid: doing things in South America and Central America and Mexico that improve the economy there, so that they don't feel the need to come over here. That would cost us a lot less than borrowing money from China, paying interest on it.\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Thank you, Dr. Carson.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump, your campaign, as you well remember, began with the idea of building a wall along the southern border.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: (inaudible).\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: It's about 315 miles southwest of where we are right now. You've said the Mexican government will pay for it.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Correct.\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: The spokesperson for the current president of Mexico says that will never happen. The last two presidents of Mexico say that will never happen. In fact, the former president of Mexico, Vicente Fox -- he said today, and I'm quoting him -- he said, "I'm not going to pay for that," quote, "effing wall."\par \par \uc2 (LAUGHTER)\par \par \uc2 So if you don't get an actual check from the Mexican government for $8 billion or $10 billion or $12 billion, whatever it will cost, how are you going to make them pay for the wall?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I will, and the wall just got 10 feet taller, believe me.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 It just got 10 feet taller. I saw him make that -- I saw him make the statement. I saw him use the word that he used. I can only tell you, if I would have used even half of that word, it would have been national scandal.\par \par \uc2 This guy used a filthy, disgusting word on television, and he should be ashamed of himself, and he should apologize, OK? Number one. Number two, we have a trade deficit with Mexico of $58 billion a year. And that doesn't include all the drugs that are pouring across and destroying our country.\par \par \uc2 We're going to make them pay for that wall. Now, the wall is $10 billion to $12 billion, if I do it. If these guys do it, it'll end up costing $200 billion.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 But the wall is $10 billion to $12 billion. You need 1,000 -- you need 1,000 miles. The Great Wall of China, built 2,000 years ago -- 2,000, is 13,000 miles. We need 1,000, because we have a lot of natural barriers.\par \par \uc2 We can do it for $10 billion to $12 billion, and it's a real wall. This is a wall that's a heck of a lot higher than the ceiling you're looking at. This is a wall that's going to work.\par \par \uc2 Mexico will pay for it, because they are not doing us any favors. They could stop all of this illegal trade if they wanted to...\par \par \uc2 (BELL RINGS)\par \par \uc2 ... immediately. Mexico will pay for the wall. It's a small portion of the kind of money that we lose and the deficits that we have with Mexico.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: If the -- if the Mexicans don't pay for the wall, will you start a trade war with Mexico?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Well, you know, I don't mind trade wars when we're losing $58 billion a year, you want to know the truth. We're losing so much. (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 We're losing so much with Mexico and China -- with China, we're losing $500 billion a year. And then people say, "don't we want to trade?" I don't mind trading, but I don't want to lose $500 billion. I don't want to lose $58 billion.\par \par \uc2 Mexico just took \uc2 Carrier Corporation\uc2  , maker of air conditioners. They just took Ford. They're building a $2.5 billion plant. They just took Nabisco out of Chicago.\par \par \uc2 And I always say I'm not having Oreos anymore, which is true, by the way. But they just took a big plant from Nabisco into Mexico. They're taking our businesses. I don't mind.\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Thank you. Senator Rubio?\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: Yeah, a couple points. If he builds the wall the way he built Trump Towers, he'll be using \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  labor to do it. The second...\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Such a cute sound bite.\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: But it -- no, it's not a sound bite. It's a fact. Again, go online and \uc2 Google\uc2  it. \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  , Polish workers. You'll see it.\par \par \uc2 The second thing, about the trade war -- I don't understand, because your ties and the clothes you make is made in Mexico and in China. So you're gonna be starting a trade war against your own ties and your own suits.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: All right, you know what?\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: Why don't you make them in America?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Because they devalue their currency -- they devalue their currencies...\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: Well, then make them in America.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: ... that makes it -- well, you don't know a thing about business. You lose on everything...\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: Well, make them in America.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Let me just tell you -- they de-value their currency. They de-value their currencies.\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: Well then, make them in America.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: That makes it -- well, you don't know a thing about business. You lose on everything you do.\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: Well, make them in America.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Let me just tell you, they de-value their currencies. China, Mexico, everybody. Japan with the cars. They de-value their currencies to such an extent that our businesses cannot compete with them, our workers lose their jobs...\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: And so you make them in China and in Russia.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: But you wouldn't know anything about it because you're a lousy businessman.\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: Well, I don't know anything about bankrupting four companies. You've bankrupted..\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: No, I -- and you know why? You know why?\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: I don't know anything about...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: You know why?\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: ... starting a university, and that was a fake university.\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: One at a time.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: First of all...\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: One at a time.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: ... first of all, that's called a...\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: There are people who borrowed $36,000...\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Hold on. One at a time, Mr. Trump.\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: ... to go to Trump University, and they're suing now -- $36,000 to go to a university...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: And by the way -- and by the way...\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: ... that's a fake school.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: ... and by the way...\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: And you know what they got? They got to take a picture with a cardboard cutout of \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  ...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: ... I've won most of the lawsuits.\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: That's what they got for $36,000.\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: All right, I want to move on.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: And they actually did a very good job, but I've won most of the lawsuits.\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Mr. Trump, Senator, I want to bring in...\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: Most of the lawsuits.\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: ... I want to bring in my colleague Maria Celeste.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Excuse me. Hey Wolf, let me ask you. Am I allowed to respond to this?\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: You're allowed -- you've been responding.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: OK. Well let -- no, I haven't. I really haven't.\par \par \uc2 (LAUGHTER)\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: He's talked through the whole thing.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Here's a guy -- here's a guy that buys a house for $179,000, he sells it to a lobbyist who's probably here for $380,000 and then legislation is passed. You tell me about this guy. This is what we're going to have as president.\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: Here's a guy that inherited $200 million. If he hadn't inherited $200 million, you know where \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  would be right now?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: No, no, no.\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: Selling watches in (inaudible)\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: (Inaudible) I took...\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: That's where he would be. TRUMP: That is so wrong. We'll work on that. I took $1 million and I turned into $10 billion.\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: Oh, OK. One million.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I borrowed $1 million...\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: Better release your tax returns so we can see how much money he made.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I borrowed $1 million, I turned it into $10 billion...\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: Oh, he doesn't make that money.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: ... more than $10 billion.\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Thank you. Thank you. I want to bring in Maria Celeste of Telemundo. Maria?\par \par \uc2 CELESTE: Senator Rubio, last week, you said that on your first day in office, you will get rid of President Obama's executive action known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, DACA for short.\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: Correct.\par \par \uc2 ARRASAS: It is a program that has protected hundreds of thousands of young people that came here when they were children, brought to the U.S. by undocumented immigrants. This is the only home they know, and that is a dramatic change from last April when you said in Spanish, and I'm going to quote you (in Spanish) which translates to DACA is going to have to end at some point, but it wouldn't be fair to cancel it immediately.\par \par \uc2 So Senator Rubio, what changed?\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: It didn't change.\par \par \uc2 ARRASAS: Why is it now fair to cancel it on Day One?\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: No, it's the same policy. It will have to end at some moment, and as I said, we will -- we will eliminate that executive order. The people that are on it now will not be allowed to renew it, and new applicants will not be allowed to apply to it. And it's not because we're not compassionate to the plight of a 2 -- someone who came here when they were 2 years old. I understand. I know people that are personally impacted by this.\par \par \uc2 The problem with the executive order is it is unconstitutional. The president doesn't have the power to do that.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 And he himself admitted that.\par \par \uc2 ARRASAS: Senator, Senator...\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: I'm sorry, but let me finish my...\par \par \uc2 ARRASAS: ... but you went -- you went from saying that it was deeply disruptive to deport them immediately to deport them on Day One.\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: No, but this is not about deportation. Everybody always goes immediately to the issue of deportation. This is about DACA. DACA is an executive order that is unconstitutional. I will cancel it on my first day in office, which means people who currently hold those permits will not be allowed to renew them when they expire, and new people will not be allowed to apply for them.\par \par \uc2 Now, I am sympathetic to the plight of someone who came here when they were 2 or 3 years old through no fault of their own, but you can't solve it doing something that is unconstitutional. No matter how sympathetic we may be to a cause, we cannot violate the Constitution of the United States the way this president now does on a regular basis.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 ARRASAS: Senator Rubio, you accused Senator Cruz in a previous debate of lying when he said that you said one thing in Spanish and another one in English. So in what sense did he lie?\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: Because it is not true that I'm not going to get rid of DACA. I am going to get rid of DACA. In the Spanish interview, you just read out the transcript in Spanish, I said, it will have to end at some point. That point will be when I eliminate the executive order and the people who have those permits when they expire will not be allowed to renew it. And new people will not be able to apply. In fact, I don't even think we should be taking new enrollees in the program now.\par \par \uc2 That is how the program ends and how you wind it down is you allow the people who are on it, when the program expires, they cannot renew it, and it goes away. But I will cancel the executive order as soon as I take -- as soon as I step foot into the Oval Office.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I have to say, he lied this time. He lied. 100 percent. 100 percent.\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: You lied about the Polish workers.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Yes, yes, yes. 38 years ago.\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: You lied to the students at Trump University.\par \par \uc2 ARRASAS: Let Senator Cruz jump in.\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: Oh, he lied 38 years ago. All right, I guess there's a statute of limitation on lies.\par \par \uc2 (LAUGHTER)\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE) CRUZ: Well Maria, I would note you made the exact same point here that I made at the last debate, and you're right that Senator Rubio called me a liar for saying that.\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: You know, we've both seen at home when Washington politicians say about an illegal, or unconstitutional program. Well, it'll have to end some day, not immediately, but someday in the future.\par \par \uc2 That, inevitably, is when a politician doesn't plan to end it at all.\par \par \uc2 You know, I'm reminded of that that is the same position that Marco took in Iowa on ethanol subsidies. When I campaigned in Iowa, I took on the lobbyists, took on the corporate welfare and said we should have no ethanol subsidies.\par \par \uc2 Marco's position was the same as it is to illegal amnesty. Well, someday it should end, just not now. And, frankly, I think we need a president who knows what he believes in, is willing to say it on day one, not at the end of his term when it's somebody else's problem.\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: That's not an accurate assessment of what I said about ethanol. What I said is that ethanol will phase out, it is phasing out now. By 2022 that program expires by virtue of the existing law, and at that point it will go away. I don't agree with the mandate and the program that's in place, but I think it's unfair that these people have gone out and invested all this money into this program and we're just going to yank it away from them.\par \par \uc2 And, again, you read the statement in Spanish. I said very clearly on Spanish television, DACA will have to end at some point, and that point is -- at that time I was not a candidate for president. I said it will end in my first day in office as president, and the people who have it now will not be able to renew it. New applicants will not be able to apply. That is the end of DACA.\par \par \uc2 I am sympathetic to this cause, but once again, it cannot supersede the Constitution of the United States which this president habitually and routinely every single day ignores and violates.\par \par \uc2 (CHEERING) (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 ARRASAS: Senator Cruz, you and Senator Rubio are the two candidates of hispanic descent on this stage. As a matter of fact, you are the first hispanic candidate ever to win a caucus or primary.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 And yet, there is the perception in the Latino community that instead of trying to prove to Latinos who has the best plan, the best platform to help them, that you two are spending the time arguing with each other. Trying to figure out which one is tougher on immigration in order to appeal to the majority of Republicans.\par \par \uc2 So, my question to you is are you missing a huge opportunity to expand the Republican base?\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: Well, Maria, you are right. It is extraordinary that of five people standing on this stage that two of us are the children of Cuban immigrants. It really is the embodiment of the incredible opportunity and promise this nation provides.\par \par \uc2 You know, I would note that a lot of folks in the media have a definition of hispanics that you can only be hispanic if you're liberal. That makes sense in the media, but I gotta tell you, one of the things I was most proud of when I ran for Senate here in Texas, I earned 40 percent of the hispanic vote here in Texas.\par \par \uc2 At the same time, Mitt Romney was getting clobbered with 27 percent of the hispanic vote nationwide. And, the reason is, as you know, you look at the value sin the hispanic community. The values in our community are faith, family, patriotism.\par \par \uc2 You know, we've got the highest rate of military enlistment among hispanics in any demographic in this country. And, when I campaigned, and I campaigned the same here in Houston or Dallas as I did in the Rio Grande Valley, defending conservative principles, defending judeo- Christian principals, telling my father's story.\par \par \uc2 Telling my Dad's story of coming to America with $100 dollars in his underwear, not speaking English, washing dishes, having hopes and dreams for the American dream. And, the truth is the Obama-Clinton economy has done enormous damage to the hispanic community. It is not working in the hispanic community, and I...\par \par \uc2 (BELL RINGING)\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: ... fighting so that everyone who is struggling in the hispanic community and beyond will have a fair and even shake at the American dream.\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: I'm sorry I was mentioned...\par \par \uc2 ARRASAS: ... Governor Kasich.\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: Maria I was mentioned in that. I was mentioned in that statement.\par \par \uc2 ARRASAS: Governor Kasich, after the...\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: ... OK. I was mentioned -- just because of the hispanic -- and I'll be brief.\par \par \uc2 A couple points, number one, I do think it's amazing that on this stage tonight there are two descendants of Cuban origin, and an African American. We are the party of diversity, not the Democratic party.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)\par \par \uc2 And, the second point I would make is that we have to move past this idea that somehow the hispanic community only cares about immigration.\par \par \uc2 Yes, it's an important issue because we know and love people that have been impacted by it. But, I'm going to tell you that the most powerful sentiment in the hispanic community, as it is in every immigrant community, is the burning desire to leave your children better off than yourself...\par \par \uc2 (BELL RINGING)\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: ... and, you can only do that through free enterprise. That's what we stand for, not socialism like Bernie Sanders, and increasingly Hillary Clinton.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 ARRASAS: Governor Kasich, after the last presidential election the Republican party realized that in order to win the presidency it needed the support of latinos. Guidelines as to how to accomplish that were spelled out in an autopsy (ph) report that concluded, and I'm going to quote it, "if hispanic Americans hear that the GOP doesn't want them in the United States they won't pay attention to our next sentence."\par \par \uc2 So, do you think that your fellow Republican candidates get it?\par \par \uc2 KASICH: Well, I'm not going to talk about that. I mean, I've got to tell you, I was with this little 12-year-old girl, was at a town hall meeting, and she said, you know, I don't like all this yelling and screaming at the debates. My mother's thinking I might not be able to watch the thing anymore.\par \par \uc2 I think we ought to move beyond that, about what they think. I'm going to tell you what I think. My position on this whole immigration issue has been clear from the beginning. I haven't changed anything with it.\par \par \uc2 And, look, my view is, we need economic growth. Everything starts with economic growth. And how do you get it? Common sense regulations, lower taxes for both business and individuals, and, of course, a fiscal plan that balances the budget.\par \par \uc2 That gives you economic growth. I did it when I was in Washington, as the Budget Committee chairman, negotiating actually with Democrats, that gave us surpluses, economic growth, and the same thing in Ohio.\par \par \uc2 But here's the thing that I believe. Economic growth is not an end unto itself. We have to make sure that everybody has a sense that they can rise.\par \par \uc2 Of course, our friends in the Hispanic community, our friends in the African-American community, the promise of America is that our system, when we follow the right formula, is going to give opportunity for everyone.\par \par \uc2 It's what Jack Kemp used to say. A rising tide lifts all boats, not just some boats, but all boats. And you know what? With me and the Hispanic community, I think they like me. And I appreciate that, because I want them to have the same opportunity that I and my children and my wife and the people we love have had in this country.\par \par \uc2 It's time to solve problems.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 ARRASAS: Dr. Carson, concerning this recommendation of the report, are you, as a candidate, getting it?\par \par \uc2 CARSON: I didn't hear the first part of the question?\par \par \uc2 ARRASAS: The first part of the question is, there was a report that recommended that in order to approach Hispanics and bring them to vote for the Republican Party, certain things needed to happen.\par \par \uc2 And one of them was that they shouldn't feel like they were going to get kicked out of the United States, otherwise they wouldn't pay attention to one more sentence from candidates.\par \par \uc2 CARSON: OK, well, first of all, let me just mention that last year at the NALEO, the \uc2 National Association for Latino Elected Officials\uc2  , I was the only one of 17 Republican candidates to go there.\par \par \uc2 And the reason that I don't fear going to an organization like that is because the message that I give is the same message to every group. You know, this is America. And we need to have policies that are -- that give liberty and justice to all people.\par \par \uc2 And that's the way that I have fashioned virtually every policy, looking at that. And I think that's the way the Republican Party generally thinks. We don't pick and choose winners and losers. We are compassionate.\par \par \uc2 But real compassion is providing people with a ladder of opportunity to climb up from a state of dependence and become part of the fabric of America. When we begin to emphasize that, I think we will attract everybody.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 ARRASAS: Mr. Trump, it is common knowledge that the Hispanic vote is very important in this race. You keep saying that Hispanics love you.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: True.\par \par \uc2 (LAUGHTER)\par \par \uc2 ARRASAS: And, yes, you won the Hispanic vote in Nevada.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: True.\par \par \uc2 ARRASAS: But a brand new Telemundo poll says that three out of four Hispanics that vote nationwide have a negative opinion of you. They don't like you. Wouldn't that make you an unelectable...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: No.\par \par \uc2 ARRASAS: ... candidate in a general election?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: First of all, I don't believe anything Telemundo says.\par \par \uc2 ARRASAS: You used to say that you love...\par \par \uc2 (LAUGHTER)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Number one. Number two, I currently employ thousands of Hispanics, and over the years, I've employed tens of thousands of Hispanics. They're incredible people. They know, and the reason I won in Nevada, not only won the big one, but I also won subs, like, as an example, I won with women.\par \par \uc2 I won with every single category. I won with men, I won with high-income, low-income, I won with Hispanics. And I got 46 percent. Nobody else was close. Because they know I'm going to bring jobs back from China, from Japan, from so many other places.\par \par \uc2 They get it. They're incredible people. They're incredible workers. They get it. And I've won many of the polls with Hispanics. I didn't maybe win the Telemundo poll.\par \par \uc2 But one thing I'm also going to do, I'm going to be getting -- bringing a lot of people in who are Democrats, who are independents, and you're seeing that with the polls, because if you look at anywhere, look at any of the elections, every single election, it has been record-setting.\par \par \uc2 And the good news is, for the Republican Party, the Democrats are getting very poor numbers in terms of bringing them in. We're getting record-setting numbers. I think I have something to do with that.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: We're getting record-setting numbers. And I won every one -- the three of them that I won, I won with record-setting numbers.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: New people are coming into the Republican Party. We are building a new Republican Party, a lot of new people are coming in.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 ARRASAS: For the record, you have said publicly that you loved Telemundo in the past. But it is not just a Telemundo poll. We have...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I love them. I love them.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 ARRASAS: All right. Well, it's not the only poll.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: They're fine. Do you know what? They're fine.\par \par \uc2 ARRASAS: Just last night -- let me -- let me finish, please.\par \par \uc2 Just last night, The Washington Post showed that 80 percent of Hispanic voters in their polls have a negative view of you. And concerning the Nevada victory, allow me to explain that the poll in Nevada was based on a tiny sample, statistically insignificant of only about 100 -- let me finish please -- of 100 Hispanic Republicans in the state of Nevada.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Why did they take the poll? Why did they...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 ARRASAS: I am making reference -- I am making reference to Hispanic voters nationwide in a general election.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I'm just telling you, I'm doing very well with Hispanics. And by the way, I settled my suit, as you know, with Univision. It was settled. We're good friends now. It was all settled up.\par \par \uc2 (LAUGHTER)\par \par \uc2 Very happy, very happy. Very good people.\par \par \uc2 I'm just telling you -- I'm just telling you that I will do really well with Hispanics. I will do better than anybody on this stage. I have respect for the people on the stage, but I will do very well with Hispanics. But I'm telling you also, I'm bringing people, Democrats over and I'm bringing independents over, and we're building a much bigger, much stronger Republican Party.\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Mr. Trump, thank you.\par \par \uc2 I want to turn our attention now to another critically important issue for the American people, the \uc2 United States Supreme Court\uc2  , where filling the vacancy left by the late Justice Antonin Scalia has become a major campaign issue. I want to bring in Salem Radio Network host, Hugh Hewitt.\par \par \uc2 Hugh?\par \par \uc2 HEWITT: Thank you, Wolf.\par \par \uc2 To me, it's the most important issue. I'll start with you, Senator Cruz. Do you trust Mr. Trump to nominate conservative justices?\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: Well, Hugh, I agree with you that it -- Justice Scalia's passing underscores the enormous gravity of this election. Justice Scalia was someone I knew personally for 20 years; was privileged to be at his funeral this weekend. And with his passing, the court is now hanging in the balance. We are one liberal justice away from a five-justice radical leftist majority that would undermine our religious liberty; that would undermine the right to life; and that would fundamentally erase the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms from the Constitution.\par \par \uc2 Now, I think the voters of Texas, the voters across Super Tuesday are assessing everyone standing on this -- this stage. In the past, Republican presidents always promise to nominate strict constitutionalists. So I'm certain if you took a survey, everyone would say they would do that.\par \par \uc2 But the reality is, Democrats bat about 1,000. Just about everyone they put on the court votes exactly as they want. Republicans have batted worse than 500, more than half of the people we put on the court have been a disaster.\par \par \uc2 I've spent my whole life fighting to defend the Bill of Rights and the Constitution. I can tell you, for voters that care about life or marriage or religious liberty or the Second Amendment, they're asking the question: Who do you know, beyond a shadow of a doubt, who do you know will nominate principled constitutionalists to the court? I give you my word, every justice I nominate will vigorously defend the Bill of Rights for my children and for yours.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 HEWITT: Mr. Trump, Senator Cruz mentioned the issue that keeps me up at night, which is religious liberty. Churches, Catholic and Christian colleges, Catholic adoption agencies -- all sorts of religious institutions fear that Hobby Lobby, if it's repealed, it was a five-four decision, they're going to have to bend their knee and provide morning-after pills. They fear that if Bob Jones is expanded, they will lose their tax exemption.\par \par \uc2 Will you commit to voters tonight that religious liberty will be an absolute litmus test for anyone you appoint, not just to the Supreme Court, but to all courts?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Yes, I would. And I've been there. And I've been there very strongly. I do have to say something, and this is interesting and it's not anybody's fault. It's not Ted's fault. Justice Roberts was strongly recommended and pushed by Ted. Justice Roberts gave us Obamacare. Might as well be called Roberts-care. Two times of the Supreme Court, Justice Roberts approved something that he should have never raised his hand to approve. And we ended up with Obamacare.\par \par \uc2 That is a rough thing. And I know Ted feels badly about it. And I think he probably still respects the judge. But that judge has been a disaster in terms of everything we stand for because there is no way -- no way that he should have approved Obamacare.\par \par \uc2 Now, with that being said, these are the things that happen. But Ted very, very strongly pushed Judge Roberts, and Justice Roberts gave us something that we don't want.\par \par \uc2 HEWITT: Ted Cruz, Senator, the chief justice got Hobby Lobby right, but what do you make of Mr. Cruz's criticism?\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: Well, listen -- Donald knows that it was George W. Bush who appointed John Roberts. Yes, it's true, I supported the Republican nominee once he was made.\par \par \uc2 But I would not have nominated John Roberts. I would have nominated my former boss, Mike Luttig, who was the strongest proven conservative on the court of appeals. And I'll tell you, Hugh...\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 ... you know, it's interesting now that Donald promises that he will appoint justices who -- who will defend religious liberty, but this is a man who, for 40 years, has given money to Jimmy Carter, to Joe Biden, to Hillary Clinton, to Chuck Schumer, to Harry Reid.\par \par \uc2 Nobody who supports far-left liberal Democrats who are fighting for judicial activists can possibly care about having principled constitutionalists on the court.\par \par \uc2 And what Donald has told us is he will go to Washington...\par \par \uc2 (BELL RINGS)\par \par \uc2 ... and cut a deal.\par \par \uc2 HEWITT: Mr. Trump...\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: So that means on Supreme Court...\par \par \uc2 HEWITT: ... can I...\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: ... he's going to look to cut a deal, rather than fight for someone who won't cut a deal on the Constitution, but will defend it faithfully.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 HEWITT: Can I trust you on religious liberty?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Well, let -- let me -- let me just say -- let me just say this. Look, I watched Ted -- and I respected it, but he gets nowhere -- stand on the Senate floor for a day or two days, and talk and talk and talk.\par \par \uc2 I watched the other senators laughing and smiling. And when Ted was totally exhausted, he left the Senate floor, and they went back to work. OK? We have to have somebody that's going to make deals.\par \par \uc2 It's wonderful to stand up for two days and do that. Now, Ted's been very critical -- I have a sister who's a brilliant...\par \par \uc2 HEWITT: Mr. Cruz, will you make a deal about religious liberty?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: ... excuse me. She's a brilliant judge. He's been criticizing -- he's been criticizing my sister for signing a certain bill. You know who else signed that bill? Justice Samuel Alito, a very conservative member of the Supreme Court, with my sister, signed that bill.\par \par \uc2 So I think that maybe we should get a little bit of an apology from Ted. What do you think?\par \par \uc2 HEWITT: Let me -- Senator.\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: Let me tell you right now, Donald, I will not apologize for a minute for defending the Constitution. I will not apologize for defending the Bill of Rights.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 And I find it amazing that your answer to Hugh and to the American people is, on religious liberty, you can't have one of the these crazy zealots that actually believes in it. You've got to be willing to cut a deal.\par \par \uc2 And you know, there is a reason why, when Harry Reid was asked, of all the people on this stage, who does he want the most, who does he like the most, Harry Reid said Donald -- \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  .\par \par \uc2 Why? Because Donald has supported him in the past, and he knows he can cut a deal with him.\par \par \uc2 (BELL RINGS)\par \par \uc2 You know what, Donald...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 HEWITT: Senator Rubio.\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: ... I don't want a Supreme Court justice that you cut a deal with Harry Reid to undermine religious liberty, because that same justice will also erase the Second Amendment from the Bill of Rights.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: When you say crazy zealot, are you talking about you? Crazy zealot -- give me a break.\par \par \uc2 HEWITT: Senator Rubio, you've heard this exchange on religious liberty. You have said that religious liberty will trump even the ability of people to stay away from same-sex marriages, not provide flowers, not provide baked goods, et cetera. Are you satisfied with this exchange on religious liberty?\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: Well, I think you ask a very important question, because the issue here -- the next president of the United States has to fill this vacancy.\par \par \uc2 Justice Scalia -- in the history of the republic, there has never been anyone better than him at standing for the principle that the Constitution is not a living and breathing document -- it is supposed to be applied as originally meant.\par \par \uc2 And the next president of the United States has to be someone that you can trust and believe in to appoint someone just as good as Scalia -- plus there may be at least two other vacancies.\par \par \uc2 So you ask Mr. Trump to respond and say that he would, and he says that he would. But the bottom line is, if you look at his record over the last 25 or 30 years, on issue after issue, he has not been on our side.\par \par \uc2 Now, if he's changed, we're always looking for converts into the conservative movement. But the bottom line is that, if (ph) you don't have a record there to look at and say, "I feel at peace that when \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  is president of the United States, he's going to be firmly on our side on these issues."\par \par \uc2 In fact, very recently, he was still defending Planned Parenthood. He says he's not going to take sides in the Palestinians versus Israel. These are concerning things.\par \par \uc2 And so, yes, I have a doubt about whether \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  , if he becomes president, will replace Justice Scalia with someone just like Justice Scalia.\par \par \uc2 HEWITT: Mr. Trump?\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Well, let -- let me just say -- let me just say, first of all, I have great respect for Justice Scalia. I thought he was terrific. And if you talk about evolving, Ronald Reagan was a somewhat liberal Democrat. Ronald Reagan evolved into a somewhat strong conservative -- more importantly, he was a great president. A great president.\par \par \uc2 As far as Planned Parenthood is concerned, I'm pro-life. I'm totally against abortion, having to do with Planned Parenthood. But millions and millions of women -- cervical cancer, breast cancer -- are helped by Planned Parenthood.\par \par \uc2 So you can say whatever you want, but they have millions of women going through Planned Parenthood that are helped greatly. And I wouldn't fund it.\par \par \uc2 I would defund it because of the abortion factor, which they say is 3 percent. I don't know what percentage it is. They say it's 3 percent. But I would defund it, because I'm pro-life. But millions of women are helped by Planned Parenthood.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 HEWITT: Governor Kasich, back to religious liberty. You've been a little bit less emphatic. You've said, same-sex couple approaches a cupcake maker, sell them a cupcake. Can we trust you as much on religious liberty as the rest of these people?\par \par \uc2 KASICH: Well, you know, of course. I mean, if -- look, I was involved in just being a pioneer in a new church. Religious institutions should be able to practice the religion that they believe in. No question and no doubt about it.\par \par \uc2 Now, in regard to same-sex marriage, I don't favor it. I've always favored traditional marriage, but, look, the court has ruled and I've moved on. And what I've said, Hugh, is that, look, where does it end?\par \par \uc2 If you're in the business of selling things, if you're not going to sell to somebody you don't agree with, OK, today I'm not going to sell to somebody who's gay, and tomorrow maybe I won't sell to somebody who's divorced.\par \par \uc2 I mean, if you're in the business of commerce, conduct commerce. That's my view. And if you don't agree with their lifestyle, say a prayer for them when they leave and hope they change their behavior.\par \par \uc2 But when it comes to the religious institutions, they are in inviolate in my mind, and I would fight for those religious institutions. And look, I've appointed over a hundred judges as governor. I even appointed adjudge to the Ohio Supreme Court.\par \par \uc2 And you know what they are? They're conservatives. Go check it out. They are conservatives. They don't make the law. They interpret the law. That's all they do. And they stick by the Constitution. So I will do that.\par \par \uc2 But let's just not get so narrow here as to gotcha this or that. I think my position is clear.\par \par \uc2 HEWITT: Dr. Carson, let me wrap it up with you. Are their positions clear?\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 HEWITT: Are the positions you've heard clear about the First Amendment and the first freedom?\par \par \uc2 CARSON: Well, first of all, let me just add my praise to Justice Scalia. I first met him when we got an honorary degree together a long time ago. A tremendous wit and intellect.\par \par \uc2 As far as religious freedom is concerned, one of the basic tenets of this nation, and I believe that the Constitution protects all of our rights. And it gives people who believe in same-sex marriage the same rights as everybody else.\par \par \uc2 But what we have to remember is even though everybody has the same rights, nobody get extra rights. So nobody gets to redefine things for everybody else and then have them have to conform to it. That's unfair.\par \par \uc2 And this is the responsibility of Congress to come back and correct what the Supreme Court has done. That's why we have divided government. And we're going to have to encourage them to act in an appropriate way, or we will lose our religious freedom.\par \par \uc2 And as president, I would go through and I would look at what a person's life has been. What have they done in the past? What kind of judgments have they made? What kind of associations do they have? That will tell you a lot more than an interview will tell you.\par \par \uc2 The fruit salad of their life is what I will look at.\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Thank you, Dr. Carson.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: All of you want to repeal and replace Obamacare, so let's talk about your plans, specific plans to replace it. I want to bring in our chief political correspondent, Dana Bash.\par \par \uc2 BASH: Senator Rubio, you said yesterday, right here in Houston, that Mr. Trump thinks part of Obamacare is pretty good. So, he says he is going to repeal Obamacare. Are you saying that you're worried he won't?\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: The individual mandate. He said he likes the individual mandate portion of it, which I don't believe that should be part of it. That should not remain there. I think here's what we need to replace it with.\par \par \uc2 We need to repeal Obamacare completely and replace it with a system that puts Americans in charge of their health care money again. If your employer wants to buy health insurance for you, they can continue to do so from any company in America they want to buy it from.\par \par \uc2 Otherwise, your employers can provide you health care money, tax- free, not treated as income, and you can use that money only for health care, but you can use it to fund health care any way you want, fully fund a health savings account, the combination of a health savings account or a private plan from any company in any state in the country.\par \par \uc2 And if you don't have that, then you will have a refundable tax credit that provides you health care money to buy your own health care coverage. And that, I think, is a much better approach than Obamacare, which, by the way, isn't just bad for health care, it's bad for our economy. It is a health care law that is basically forcing companies to lay people off, cut people's hours, move people to part-time. It is not just a bad health care law, it is a job-killing law. And I will repeal it as president and we will replace it with something substantially better for all Americans.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 BASH: Mr. Trump, Senator Rubio just said that you support the individual mandate. Would you respond?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I just want to say, I agree with that 100 percent, except pre-existing conditions, I would absolutely get rid of Obamacare. We're going to have something much better, but pre-existing conditions, when I'm referring to that, and I was referring to that very strongly on the show with Anderson Cooper, I want to keep pre- existing conditions.\par \par \uc2 I think we need it. I think it's a modern age. And I think we have to have it.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 BASH: OK, so let's talk about pre-existing conditions. What the insurance companies say is that the only way that they can cover people is to have a mandate requiring everybody purchase health insurance. Are they wrong?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I think they're wrong 100 percent. What we need -- look, the insurance companies take care of the politicians. The insurance companies get what they want. We should have gotten rid of the lines around each state so we can have real competition.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: We thought that was gone, we thought those lines were going to be gone, so something happened at the last moment where Obamacare got approved, and all of that was thrown out the window.\par \par \uc2 The reason is some of the people in the audience are insurance people, and insurance lobbyists, and special interests. They got -- I'm not going to point to these gentlemen, of course, they're part of the problem, other than Ben, in all fairness.\par \par \uc2 And, actually, the Governor too, let's just talk about these too, OK?\par \par \uc2 (LAUGHTER)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Because I don't think the Governor had too much to do with this.\par \par \uc2 But, we should have gotten rid of the borders, we should have gotten rid of the lines around the state so there's great competition. The insurance companies are making a fortune on every single thing they do.\par \par \uc2 I'm self-funding my campaign. I'm the only one in either party self-funding my campaign. I'm going to do what's right. We have to get rid of the lines around the states so that there's serious, serious competition.\par \par \uc2 BASH But, Mr. Trump...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: ... And, you're going to see -- excuse me. You're going to see preexisting conditions and everything else be part of it, but the price will be done, and the insurance companies can pay. Right now they're making a fortune.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 BASH: But, just to be specific here, what you're saying is getting rid of the barriers between states, that is going to solve the problem...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: That's going to solve the problem. And, the insurance companies aren't going to say that, they want to keep it. They want to say -- they say whatever they have to say to keep it the way it is. I know the insurance companies, they're friends of mine. The top guys, they're friends of mine. I shouldn't tell you guys, you'll say it's terrible, I have a conflict of interest. They're friends of mine, there's some right in the audience. One of them was just waving to me, he was laughing and smiling. He's not laughing so much anymore.\par \par \uc2 Hi.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Look, the insurance companies are making an absolute fortune. Yes, they will keep preexisting conditions, and that would be a great thing. Get rid of Obamacare, we'll come up with new plans. But, we should keep preexisting conditions.\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: Dana, I was mentioned in his response, so if I may about the insurance companies...\par \par \uc2 BASH: ... Go ahead.\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: You may not be aware of this, Donald, because you don't follow this stuff very closely, but here's what happened. When they passed Obamacare they put a bailout fund in Obamacare. All these lobbyists you keep talking about, they put a bailout fund in the law that would allow public money to be used, taxpayer money, to bail out companies when they lost money.\par \par \uc2 And, we led the effort and wiped out that bailout fund. The insurance companies are not in favor of me, they hate that. They're suing that now to get that bailout money put back in.\par \par \uc2 Here's what you didn't hear in that answer, and this is important guys, this is an important thing. What is your plan? I understand the lines around the state, whatever that means. This is not a game where you draw maps...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: ... And, you don't know what it means...\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: ... What is your plan, Mr. Trump?\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: What is your plan on healthcare?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: You don't know.\par \par \uc2 BASH: (inaudible)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: ... The biggest problem...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: ... What's your plan...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: ... The biggest problem, I'll have you know...\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: ... What's your plan... TRUMP: ... You know, I watched him meltdown two weeks ago with Chris Christie. I got to tell you, the biggest problem he's got is he really doesn't know about the lines. The biggest thing we've got, and the reason we've got no competition, is because we have lines around the state, and you have essentially....\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: ... We already mentioned that (inaudible) plan, I know what that is, but what else is part of your plan...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: ... You don't know much...\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: ... So, you're only thing is to get rid of the lines around the states. What else is part of your healthcare plan...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: ... The lines around the states...\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: ... That's your only plan...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: ... and, it was almost done -- not now...\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: ... Alright, (inaudible)...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: ... Excuse me. Excuse me.\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: ... His plan. That was the plan...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: ... You get rid of the lines, it brings in competition. So, instead of having one insurance company taking care of New York, or Texas, you'll have many. They'll compete, and it'll be a beautiful thing.\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: Alright...\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: So, that's the only part of the plan? Just the lines?\par \par \uc2 BASH: (inaudible)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: The nice part of the plan -- you'll have many different plans. You'll have competition, you'll have so many different plans.\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: Now he's repeating himself.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: No, no, no.\par \par \uc2 (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: (inaudible)\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: (inaudible)\par \par \uc2 (CHEERING)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: (inaudible) I watched him repeat himself five times four weeks ago... RUBIO: ... I just watched you repeat yourself five times five seconds ago...\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I watched him meltdown on the stage like that, I've never seen it in anybody...\par \par \uc2 BASH: ... Let's stay focused on the subject...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: ... I thought he came out of the swimming pool...\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: ... I see him repeat himself every night, he says five things, everyone's dumb, he's gonna make America great again...\par \par \uc2 BASH: ... Senator Rubio...\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: ... We're going to win, win win, he's winning in the polls...\par \par \uc2 BASH: ... Senator Rubio, please.\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: ... And the lines around the state.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: ... Every night.\par \par \uc2 BASH: Senator Rubio.\par \par \uc2 (CHEERING)\par \par \uc2 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I tell the truth, I tell the truth.\par \par \uc2 BASH: Senator Rubio, you will have time to respond if you would just let Mr. Trump respond to what you've just posed to him...\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: ... Yeah, he's going to give us his plan now, right? OK...\par \par \uc2 BASH: ... If you could talk a little bit more about your plan. I know you talked about...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: ... We're going to have many different plans because...\par \par \uc2 BASH: ... Can you be a little specific...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: ... competition...\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: ... He's done it again.\par \par \uc2 (CHEERING) (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: There is going to be competition among all of the states, and the insurance companies. They're going to have many, many different plans. BASH: Is there anything else you would like to add to that...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: No, there's nothing to add.\par \par \uc2 (CHEERING) (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: What is to add?\par \par \uc2 BASH: Thank you. Thank you both.\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: Alright.\par \par \uc2 BASH: Governor Kasich, you've said it is, quote, "Un American to deny someone health insurance if they have a preexisting condition."\par \par \uc2 BASH: Would you leave the individual mandate in place requiring all Americans to purchase insurance?\par \par \uc2 KASICH: No, I wouldn't. And -- but that doesn't matter when it comes to the issue of preexisting conditions. You don't want any American to lose their house, everything they've saved, because they get sick. Now, I think it is more complicated than what we've heard here tonight. We're actually running significant health reform in my state.\par \par \uc2 I would repeal Obamacare for a variety of reasons. I would take some of the federal resources, combine it with the freed-up Medicaid program, which I would send back to the states, and cover the people who are currently the working poor because we don't want to have tens of millions of Americans losing their health insurance.\par \par \uc2 And then we're driving towards total transparency. If any of you here ever get a hospital bill, it's easier to interpret the Dead Sea scrolls than to understand your hospital bill. The fact is what we need is transparency with hospitals and with the providers.\par \par \uc2 And I'll tell you what we will do. We are actually going to make payments to physicians and to hospitals who actually deliver healthcare with great quality at low prices. We actually are going to make the market work.\par \par \uc2 BASH: Governor, let me just go back to the original question about the individual mandate. In 1994 when you were in Congress, you proposed a plan requiring an individual mandate. So what changed?\par \par \uc2 KASICH: Well, Dana, \uc2 the Heritage Foundation\uc2  had this position as well. And when I look at it, I don't think it's tenable. And we don't need to do that. Again, I'm telling you that we are going to -- we have a proposal, a plan that we're enacting now that says if you are a hospital or a doctor and you're providing very high quality at lower prices, below the midpoint -- some charge high, some charge low. If you are below the midpoint, we are going to give you a financial reward for allowing you to provide services that result in high quality for our people at lower pricess.\par \par \uc2 That is the way in which we are going to damp down the rising costs of healthcare. Because if you think about your own deductibles today, they're going higher, higher and higher. And you know what? At some point, people can't afford it. Our plan will work. It uses the market. It uses transparency. It gets the patient in the middle. And guess what? We're actually doing it in my state, the seventh-largest state in the country. And if this will go -- this will go national, we will get our hands on healthcare where you will know what's going on. We will pay for quality, lower prices, and we will begin to see healthcare become affordable in America and where people will also be able to have health insurance, even if they have a preexisting condition.\par \par \uc2 We don't want to throw millions of people out into the cold and not have the health insurance, Dana. So that's really what we're doing. This is not a theory. This is what we are actually doing in our state. We will begin payments next year based on episodes that we have in our lives. If our primary care physicians keep us healthy for a year, with really high quality, guess what? They will get a financial reward.\par \par \uc2 Our primary care physicians need help. They need support. We're losing them. This will allow them to get a reward for doing a great job.\par \par \uc2 BASH: Governor Kasich, thank you.\par \par \uc2 KASICH: Thank you.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 BASH: Dr. Carson, you have dealt with the sickest of patients. You support covering preexisting conditions. How would you change Obamacare, but maintain that coverage?\par \par \uc2 CARSON: Well, first of all, healthcare is not a right. But I do believe it is a responsibility for a responsible society, and we are that. We spend almost twice as much per capita on healthcare as many other nations who have actually much better access than we do.\par \par \uc2 I propose a system in which we use health empowerment accounts, which are like a health savings account with no bureaucrats. And we give it to everybody from birth until death. They can pass it on when they die. We pay for it with the same dollars that we pay for traditional healthcare with. We give people the ability to shift money within their health empowerment account within their family. So dad's $500 short, mom can give it to him or a cousin or uncle.\par \par \uc2 And it makes every family their own insurance carrier with no middle man. It gives you enormous flexibility. And also, you know, if Uncle Joe is smoking like a chimney, everybody's going to hide his cigarettes because they're all interested in what's going on there.\par \par \uc2 Also, the -- your catastrophic healthcare is going to cost a lot less money now because the only thing coming out of that is catastrophic healthcare. So, it's like a homeowners policy with a large deductible, versus a homeowners policy where you want every scratch covered. One costs $1,500 a year; one costs $10,000 a year. You can buy the $1,500 one. That will take care of 75 percent of the people. The people who are indigent, how do we take care of them now? Medicaid. What's the Medicaid budget? Almost $500 billion; almost 80 million people participate, which is way too many, and that will get a lot better when we fix the economy, which I hope we get a chance to talk about.\par \par \uc2 CARSON: But do the math. Over $5,000 for each man, woman and child, and all -- they will have a lot more flexibility. What could you buy with that? A concierge practice.\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Thank you.\par \par \uc2 CARSON: And you could still have thousands of dollars left over. And let me just finish, because I don't get to talk that much. And, you know, let's...\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 ... you can have the money that's left over to buy your catastrophic insurance. But most importantly, we give them a menu, just like we do in Medicare Part C, and they have the choices that will allow them not only to have catastrophic health care, but drug care and everything else.\par \par \uc2 It will be such a good program that nobody will want Obamacare after that, and that's probably the best way do it, although if anybody still did, I would still de-fund it.\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Thank you.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Thank you, Dr. Carson. Let's talk about the economy. Let's talk about...\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: Wolf, Wolf, Wolf. Does everyone get to address Obamacare but me?\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: I want to move on, but there'll be plenty of opportunities for you to address...\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: It's kind of an issue I have a long history with.\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: I know you do. And -- all right, go ahead.\par \par \uc2 (LAUGHTER)\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: Thank you, Wolf.\par \par \uc2 KASICH: How do you -- how do you get that extra time, Cruz? You're very good at... CRUZ: You know, this is another issue on which Donald and I have sharp disagreements. On Planned Parenthood, he thinks Planned Parenthood is wonderful. I would instruct the Department of Justice to investigate them and prosecute any and all criminal violations.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 On Obamacare, both Donald and I say we want to end it, but for very different reasons. I want to end it because it goes too far, it's killed millions of jobs, and it's hurting people's health care. Donald wants to end it because he says it doesn't go nearly far enough. And what was amazing in that exchange that was missing is for decades Donald has been advocating socialized medicine.\par \par \uc2 What he's said is government should pay for everyone's health care, and in fact, a couple of debates ago, he said, if you don't support socialized health care, you're heartless. Now, liberal Democrats have been saying that for years. Now let me tell you if you're a small business owner, \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  's socialized medicine, putting the government in charge of your health care would kill more jobs than Obamacare, and if you're elderly, the results of socialized medicine in every country on earth where it's been implemented has been rationing, has been the government saying, no, you don't get that hip replacement, you don't get that knee replacement, the government is in charge of your health care.\par \par \uc2 I'll tell you this. As president...\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Senator...\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: ... I will repeal every word of Obamacare.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Thank you, thank you. Mr. Trump?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I do not want socialized medicine, just so you understand. He goes around saying oh, he wants it. I do not want socialized medicine. I do agree with him that it's going to be a disaster, Obamacare, for the economy.\par \par \uc2 In 2017, it will be impossible for us to pay for it if you look at what's going on. That's why it has to be repealed, for a lot of reasons, Number one, it doesn't work, number two, premium. You look at premiums going up, 25, 35, even 45 percent, and more. We have to get rid of Obamacare. It is going to destroy our economy completely. Our economy is not doing well. It is going to destroy our economy greatly. And on that, I agree.\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: Donald, true or false, you've said the government should pay for everyone's health care.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: That's false.\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: You've never said that?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: No, I said it worked in a couple of countries...\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: But you've never stood on this debate stage and says it works great in Canada and Scotland and we should do it here.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: No, I did not. No I did not.\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: Did you say if you want people to die on the streets, if you don't support socialized health care, you have no heart.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Correct. I will not let people die on the streets if I'm president.\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: Have you said you're a liberal on health care?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Excuse me. Let me talk. If people...\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: Talk away. Explain your plan, please.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: If people -- my plan is very simple. I will not -- we're going to have private -- we are going to have health care, but I will not allow people to die on the sidewalks and the streets of our country if I'm president. You may let it and you may be fine with it...\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: So does the government pay for everyone's health care?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: ... I'm not fine with it. We are going to take those people...\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: Yes or no. Just answer the question.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Excuse me. We are going to take those people and those people are going to be serviced by doctors and hospitals. We're going to make great deals on it, but we're not going to let them die in the streets.\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: Who pays for it?\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: Well, can I just clarify something?\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Gentleman, please.\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: Wolf, no. I want to clarify something.\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Gentlemen please. I want to move on.\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: This is a Republican debate, right? Because that attack about letting people die in the streets...\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: I want to talk about the economy.\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Gentleman, gentleman. All of you have agreed -- Senator Cruz...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: You know what? Call it what you want.\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: It's a yes or no.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Call it what you want, people are not going to be dying on the sidewalk.\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: All of you have agreed -- all of you have agreed to the rules. I want to move on. We're talking about the economy right now. Mr. Trump, you want to cut taxes more than President Ronald Reagan did, more than President George W. Bush did. The Independent Tax Foundation says the cost to the country of your proposal would be about $10 trillion, and that takes into account the economic growth that would emerge from your proposed tax cuts.\par \par \uc2 How would you cut $10 trillion over 10 years, but make sure the country isn't saddled with even more debt?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Because the country will become a dynamic economy. We'll be dynamic again. If you look at what's going on, we have the highest taxes anywhere in the world. We pay more business tax, we pay more personal tax. We have the highest taxes in the world.\par \par \uc2 It's shutting off our economy. It's shutting off our country. We have trillions of dollars outside that we can't get in. Yes, we will do my tax plan, and it will be great. We will have a dynamic economy again.\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: What specific cuts will you make to pay for that tax cut?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: We're going to make many cuts in business. We're getting rid of -- we're going to get rid of so many different things. Department of Education -- Common Core is out. We're going local. Have to go local.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Environmental protection -- we waste all of this money. We're going to bring that back to the states. And we're going to have other (inaudible) many things. (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 We are going to cut many of the agencies, we will balance our budget, and we will be dynamic again.\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Mr. Trump -- Mr. Trump. If you eliminate completely the Department of Education, as you have proposed, that's about $68 billion. If you eliminate the \uc2 Environmental Protection Agency\uc2  , that's about $8 billion. That's about $76 billion for those two agencies.\par \par \uc2 The current deficit this year is $544 billion. Where are you going to come up with the money?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Waste, fraud and abuse all over the place. Waste, fraud and abuse.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 You look at what's happening with Social Security, you look -- look at what's happening with every agency -- waste, fraud and abuse. We will cut so much, your head will spin.\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Governor Kasich.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 When you were in Congress, you were chairman of the Budget Committee. You helped craft the last balanced budget the United States had. Can Mr. Trump's plan work?\par \par \uc2 KASICH: Well, I think it takes three things, Wolf. And I've done it. I mean, I -- we got the budget balanced. We cut the capital gains tax. You see, in order to get this economy moving again, you have to grow the economy, and you have to restrain the spending.\par \par \uc2 And when I was chairman, we cut that capital gains tax and we instituted a significant program to get to balance. We had a balanced budget four years in a row, had to take on every interest group in Washington -- every single one of them -- and we paid down a half a trillion of the national debt.\par \par \uc2 And why do you do it? Because you want job growth. If you don't have regulatory reform, common-sense regulations, reasonable tax cuts, which I have, and a fiscal plan, you won't get there. You will never be able to do it.\par \par \uc2 Now, I -- I inherited an an $8 billion hole in Ohio, I have common-sense regulations, I have tax cuts -- the biggest of any governor in the country -- and we have a fiscal plan.\par \par \uc2 And it's not all -- it's not always cutting. It's innovating -- it's producing a better product at, frankly, a lower price. Now we have a $2 billion surplus. Our credit is strong, our pensions are strong.\par \par \uc2 And, look -- I've got a plan to take to Washington, and I will have it there in the first hundred days, and it will include shifting welfare, education, transportation, Medicaid and job training back to us, so we can begin, in the states, to be the laboratories of innovation.\par \par \uc2 I've done it -- I did it in Washington -- four years of balanced budgets. No one could even believe it happened.\par \par \uc2 (BELL RINGS)\par \par \uc2 I've done it in Ohio, we're growing, the jobs are up and people are having opportunity. And I will go back to Washington and do it again for the American people. I promise you that.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Within the first hundred days, we will have the plan to get this done.\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Thank you. Thank you, governor.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Speaking of taxes...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I just want to say -- and I'm a big fan of the governor, but they also struck oil, OK, so that helped Iowa a lot.\par \par \uc2 KASICH: OK, let me -- let me -- let me just talk about that, because I know that -- that Donald believes the energy industry is important. So do I. But of the over 400,000 jobs that we've created in the state, we think maybe 15,000 are connected to this industry, because it's early-stage.\par \par \uc2 See, what we've done in Ohio, and what a president needs to do, is to have a cabinet and a whole operation that's jobs-friendly. We have diversified our economy.\par \par \uc2 We -- we do have energy, we have medical devices, we have financial services, we have I.T., we just got Amazon -- their Cloud computing in the Midwest. You know why it's happening?\par \par \uc2 (BELL RINGS)\par \par \uc2 Because we're balanced budgets, we're strong, we're job-friendly, we don't raise their taxes, and if we have a president that does that in America, we will get the economic growth, and that is what this country needs. Jobs, jobs and jobs, period.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Mr. Trump, yesterday, the last Republican presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, called on you to release your back tax returns, and said, and I'm quoting him now, "there is good reason to believe there is a bombshell in them."\par \par \uc2 Romney said either you're not as wealthy as you say you are, said maybe you haven't paid the kind of taxes we would expect you to pay, or you haven't been giving the money to veterans or disabled people. Are any of those accusations that he has leveled true?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: All right. First of all, let me just explain. I was the first one to file a financial disclosure form -- almost 100 pages. You don't learn anything about somebody's wealth with a tax return. You learn it from statements.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I filed -- which shows that I'm worth over $10 billion. I built a great company with very little debt. People were shocked, the people in the back, the reporters, they were shocked when they went down. And I filed it on time. I didn't ask for five 45-day extensions, which I would have been entitled to.\par \par \uc2 So as far as that's concerned, I filed it. And that's where you find out what kind of a company. You don't learn anything from a tax return.\par \par \uc2 I will say this. Mitt Romney looked like a fool when he delayed and delayed and delayed. And Harry Reid baited him so beautifully. And Mitt Romney didn't file his return until a September 21st of 2012, about a month-and-a-half before the election. And it cost him big league.\par \par \uc2 As far as my return, I want to file it, except for many years, I've been audited every year. Twelve years, or something like that. Every year they audit me, audit me, audit me.\par \par \uc2 Nobody gets audited -- I have friends that are very wealthy people. They never get audited. I get audited every year. I will absolutely give my return, but I'm being audited now for two or three years, so I can't do it until the audit is finished, obviously. And I think people would understand that.\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Hugh, go ahead.\par \par \uc2 HEWITT: Mr. Trump. You told me...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Are you going to ask anybody else that question?\par \par \uc2 CARSON: Yes, amen, amen.\par \par \uc2 (LAUGHTER)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Every single question comes to me?\par \par \uc2 HEWITT: Mr. Trump...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I know I'm here for the ratings, but it's a little bit ridiculous.\par \par \uc2 (LAUGHTER) HEWITT: Mr. Trump, a year ago you told me on my radio show, the audio and the transcript are out there on \uc2 YouTube\uc2  , that you would release your tax returns.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: True.\par \par \uc2 HEWITT: Are you going back on your commitment?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: No, I'm not. First of all, very few people listen to your radio show. That's the good news.\par \par \uc2 (LAUGHTER)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Let me just tell you, let me just -- which happens to be true. Check out the ratings.\par \par \uc2 Look, let me just tell you something. Let me just tell you something. I want to release my tax returns but I can't release it while I'm under an audit. We're under a routine audit. I've had it for years, I get audited.\par \par \uc2 And obviously if I'm being audited, I'm not going to release a return. As soon as the audit is done, I love it.\par \par \uc2 HEWITT: So, Senator Rubio, Mitt Romney also called upon to you release your tax returns. Your campaign said last spring that you would release your returns that you had not previously released. And you said, coming out any day momentarily. When are we going to see your returns?\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: Yes, tomorrow or Saturday, in fact, is our plan to release them. And there's nothing really that interesting in them. So I have no problem releasing them. And luckily I'm not being audited this year, or last year, for that matter.\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: But this is my time. I want to go back to this question you asked about the debt. This is an important issue. It's a huge issue, OK? In less than five years, 83 percent of our entire budget will be made up of Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and the interest on the debt.\par \par \uc2 That means only 17 percent of our budget will be for things like the military or the Department of Education or environmental protection issues.\par \par \uc2 You cannot balance our budget unless you deal with that 83 percent, which is why I've been repeatedly talking about since my time running for the Senate in Florida, where there are a lot of people like my mother that depend on Social Security and Medicare, on the need to save those programs, by reforming the way they work for future generations.\par \par \uc2 And I think if we -- the longer we take to do this, the closer we are going to get to a debt crisis. And, Wolf, you did not get an answer to your question. This debt issue is -- the next president of the United States will not be able to serve four to eight years without dealing with the national debt.\par \par \uc2 It is not a question of if, it is a question of when we have a debt crisis. And we should not leave the stage here tonight without hearing a serious answer from every single one of us about how we are going to deal bring the national debt under control once and for all.\par \par \uc2 HEWITT: Thank you, Senator Rubio. But I am...\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 HEWITT: I'm being fair to all of the candidates.\par \par \uc2 Senator Cruz, Tuesday is five days away. Why haven't voters seen your 2012, 2013, and 2014 returns?\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: So, I've released five years of tax returns already. We will have two more years available tomorrow. And I would note that this question really goes -- you know, Donald says he's being audited.\par \par \uc2 Well, I would think that would underscore the need to release those returns. If he has said something that was false and that an audit is going to find was fraudulent, the voters need to know.\par \par \uc2 And listen, people across this country, we recognize our country is in crisis. The most important question is how do we win the general election in November, 2016. And roughly 65 percent of Republicans think Donald is not the right candidate to go against Hillary Clinton.\par \par \uc2 Now, part of the reason in the last 10 polls...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Eighty-five percent say you, big difference.\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: ... RealClearPolitics he has lost to Hillary on eight of them. In the last 10 polls on RealClearPolitics, I either tied or beat Hillary. And this is an example.\par \par \uc2 You know, the mainstream media is laying off Donald now. They're going to pick apart his taxes. They're going to pick apart his business deals.\par \par \uc2 And let's take, for example, one of Hillary's great vulnerabilities, the corruption at the \uc2 Clinton Foundation\uc2  , the fact that she had CEOs and foreign companies giving her money while she was secretary of state.\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: The next Republican nominee needs to be able to make that case against Hillary. And if Donald tried to did it, Hillary would turn to Donald and say, "but gosh, Donald, you gave $100,000 to the Clinton foundation. I even went to your wedding."\par \par \uc2 He can't prosecute the case against Hillary, and we can't risk another four years of these failed Obama policies by nominating someone who loses to Hillary Clinton in November.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: So at the beginning, I said openly to everybody that I contribute to many, many politicians, both Republican and Democrat. And I have, over the years. I'm a businessman. I have, over the years.\par \par \uc2 And I sort of have to laugh when Ted makes a big deal out of the fact that he's doing well in the polls. Well, I'm beating him in virtually every poll. I'm tied in Texas, by the way, which I shouldn't be. But I think I'll do very well.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 But a poll just came out -- a Bloomberg poll -- where I am beating him so badly that it's, like, embarrassing even for me to say I'm beating him that badly.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 And -- and here's the thing -- it was sort of funny -- 65 percent of the people don't like you -- I just got 36 percent of the vote, right? I just got 46 percent on another one. I got 38 percent...\par \par \uc2 (BELL RINGS)\par \par \uc2 ... on another one. That means -- and he got 20 and 22, and he lost in South Carolina so badly -- that was going to be his stronghold. He said a year ago, "I can't lose South Carolina." I beat him in a landslide.\par \par \uc2 Last week in Nevada, I beat him in a landslide, and he sang (ph) about the polls. One other thing -- Hillary Clinton -- take a look at USA Today, take a look at the Q poll. I beat her, and I beat her badly. And I -- and I haven't even started at her. I only had one little interchange...\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 ... I only had one little interchange, and that was...\par \par \uc2 (BELL RINGS)\par \par \uc2 ... four weeks ago, when she said I was sexist. And believe me, they had a rough weekend that weekend, between Bill and Hillary. They had a rough weekend.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Gentlemen. Gentlemen. Gentlemen.\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: Hold on. He -- he attacked me, Wolf. I get a response.\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: I was about to say -- Senator Cruz, respond.\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: Thank you. Thank -- thank -- thank you very much.\par \par \uc2 You know, it's interesting -- Donald went -- went on -- on an extended tirade about the polls, but he didn't respond to any of the substance. He has yet to say -- he can release past year's tax returns. He can do it tomorrow.\par \par \uc2 He doesn't want to do it, because presumably there's something in there...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Nothing.\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: ... that is bad. If there's nothing, release them tomorrow.\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: They're already prepared. The only reason he's not releasing them...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: You -- you don't...\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: ... is because he's afraid that he will get hit.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I'm not afraid (inaudible).\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: You know, Marco made reference earlier to the litigation against Trump University. It's a fraud case. His lawyers have scheduled the trial for July.\par \par \uc2 I want you to think about, if this man is the nominee, having the Republican nominee...\par \par \uc2 (BELL RINGS)\par \par \uc2 ... on the stand in court, being cross-examined about whether he committed fraud. You don't think the mainstream media will go crazy on that?\par \par \uc2 And on substance, how do we nominate a candidate who has said Hillary Clinton was the best secretary of state of modern times, who agreed with her on foreign policy, who agrees with Bernie Sanders on health care, who agreed with Barack Obama on the Wall Street bailout?\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: All right (ph)...\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: If -- we've got to win this election, and we can't do it with a candidate who agrees with Hillary Clinton and can't take it to her and beat her on the debate stage and at the polls.\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Mr. Trump. Mr, -- hold on. Mr. Trump -- Mr. Trump...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: ... first of all, he's talking about the polls. I'm beating him awfully badly in the polls.\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: But you're not beating Hillary. You're not beating Hillary.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Well, then, if I can't -- if -- hey, if I can't beat her, you're really going to get killed, aren't you?\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: So -- so let me ask you this, because you're really getting beaten badly. I know you're embarrassed -- I know you're embarrassed, but keep fighting -- keep swinging, man (ph). Swing for the fences.\par \par \uc2 Let me just tell you -- let me just tell you, the Trump University case is a civil case. Not a -- it's a civil case. It's a case where people want to try and get -- it's a case that is nonsense.\par \par \uc2 It's something I could have settled many times. I could settle it right now for very little money, but I don't want to do it out of principle. The people that took the course all signed -- most -- many -- many signed report cards saying it was fantastic, it was wonderful, it was beautiful.\par \par \uc2 As -- and believe me, I'll win that case. That's an easy case. Civil case. Number two, as far as the taxes are concerned, I'm being audited. It's a very routine audit, and it's very unfair, because I've been audited for, I think, over 12 years.\par \par \uc2 Every year, because of the size of my company, which is very, very large, I'm being audited -- which is a very large company.\par \par \uc2 (BELL RINGS)\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Thank you.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I'm being audited 12 years in a row, at least.\par \par \uc2 Now, until that audit's done, and I don't think anybody would blame me, I'm not giving it...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: ... the years you're not being audited? Will you release those years?\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Gentlemen, gentlemen, thank you.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: (inaudible) audited for those years.\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: Which years? Which years are you being audited?\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Gentlemen...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: ... we actually have rules -- we're trying to obey these rules that all of you agreed. We're going to take a quick break. We have a lot more -- many more critically important issues to discuss.\par \par \uc2 Our coverage of this tenth Republican presidential debate from the \uc2 University of Houston\uc2  continues in a moment.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 (COMMERCIAL BREAK)\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Welcome back to the Republican presidential debate here at the \uc2 University of Houston\uc2  .\par \par \uc2 Gentlemen, I want to turn our attention right now to key issues involving foreign policy and national security. And Mr. Trump, I'll begin with you.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Shocking.\par \par \uc2 (LAUGHTER)\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: You said this about the ongoing conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians -- I'm quoting you now: "Let me be sort of a neutral guy. I don't want to say whose fault it is, I don't think it helps."\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Right.\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Here's the question. How do you remain neutral when the U.S. considers Israel to be America's closest ally in the Middle East?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Well, first of all, I don't think they do under President Obama because I think he's treated Israel horribly, all right? I think he's treated Israel horribly.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I was the grand marshall down 5th Avenue a number of years ago for the Israeli Day Parade, I have very close ties to Israel. I've received the Tree of Life Award and many of the greatest awards given by Israel.\par \par \uc2 As president, however, there's nothing that I would rather do to bring peace to Israel and its neighbors generally. And I think it serves no purpose to say that you have a good guy and a bad guy.\par \par \uc2 Now, I may not be successful in doing it. It's probably the toughest negotiation anywhere in the world of any kind. OK? But it doesn't help if I start saying, "I am very pro-Israel, very pro, more than anybody on this stage." But it doesn't do any good to start demeaning the neighbors, because I would love to do something with regard to negotiating peace, finally, for Israel and for their neighbors.\par \par \uc2 And I can't do that as well -- as a negotiator, I cannot do that as well if I'm taking big, big sides. With that being said, I am totally pro-Israel.\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Senator Cruz?\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: Well, this is another area on which Donald agrees with Hillary Clinton and on which I disagree with them both strongly. Both Donald and Hillary Clinton want to be neutral, to use Donald's word, between Israel and the Palestinians.\par \par \uc2 Let me be clear. If I'm president, America will stand unapologetically with the nation of Israel.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 And the notion of neutrality is based upon the left buying into this moral relativism that is often pitched in the media. Listen, it is not equivalent. When you have terrorist strapping dynamite around their chest, exploding and murdering innocent women and children, they are not equivalent to the IDF officers protecting Israel. And I will not pretend that they are.\par \par \uc2 Just today, Iran announced they're going to pay $7,000 to each suicide bomber. And I would note, missing from Donald's answer was anything he has done in his nearly 70 years of living defending Israel. I have over and over again led the fight to defend Israel, to fight for Israel. And this -- if you want to know who will stand with Israel, we ought to start with who has stood with Israel when the heat was on.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Mr. Trump?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Well, I can only say -- look, I can only say I've been a big contributor to Israel over the years. I've received many, many awards from Israel, as I've said before. I have a great relationship with Israel. And I'm going to keep it that way. And if I could bring peace, that would be a fantastic thing. It would be one of my greatest achievements as president.\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Governor Kasich, I want you to weigh in.\par \par \uc2 KASICH: Well, I mean, well, I was in Congress for 18 years on the Defense Committee. And then, you know, after 9/11, the secretary of defense called me in to help out with some things. And I've been a supporter of Israel -- a strong supporter of Israel longer than anybody on this stage. I didn't give as much money as Donald gave, but I've been standing with the Israelis for a very long time.\par \par \uc2 And frankly, I think the problem we have in foreign policy right now, Wolf, is that we are not certain with who we stand with. Our allies are not sure what to make of us, and our enemies are moving. And one -- are moving because they're not sure what we will do.\par \par \uc2 It's a very interesting development here within the 24 hours. We said to the South Koreans that we would give them the high altitude defense system. It really rattled the Chinese, and for the first time since we took positive action, the Chinese are beginning to take action against North Korea.\par \par \uc2 When we stand firm and we let the world know who we're with, who we stand for, and we bring our allies together, that is the road forward.\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: We're going to get to North Korea in a moment. But Senator Rubio, what's wrong with the U.S. being an honest broker in a negotiation, as Mr. Trump is proposing?\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: Because -- and I don't know if Donald realizes this. I'm sure it's not his intent perhaps. But the position you've taken is an anti-Israel position. And here's why. Because you cannot be an honest broker in a dispute between two sides in which one of the sides is constantly acting in bad faith. The Palestinian Authority has walked away from multiple efforts to make peace, very generous offers from the Israels. Instead, here's what the Palestinians do. They teach their four- year-old children that killing Jews is a glorious thing. Here's what Hamas does. They launch rockets and terrorist attacks again Israel on an ongoing basis. The bottom line is, a deal between Israel and the Palestinians, given the current makeup of the Palestinians, is not possible.\par \par \uc2 And so the next president of the United States needs to be someone like me who will stand firmly on the side of Israel. I'm not -- I'm not going to sit here and say, "Oh, I'm not on either side." I will be on a side. I will be on Israel's side every single day because they are the only pro-American, free enterprise democracy in the entire Middle East.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Mr. Trump?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I'm a negotiator. I've done very well over the years through negotiation. It's very important that we do that. In all fairness, Marco is not a negotiator. I watched him melt down and I'll tell you, it was one of the saddest things I've ever seen. He's not going down -- excuse me...\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: He thinks a Palestinian is a real estate deal.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: ... wait a minute, and these people may even be tougher than Chris Christie. OK?\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: The Palestinians are not a real estate deal, Donald.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: OK, no, no, no -- a deal is a deal. Let me tell you that. I learned a long time ago.\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: A deal is not a deal when you're dealing with terrorists. Have you ever negotiated with terrorists?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: You are not a negotiator. You are not a negotiator.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: And, with your thinking, you will never bring peace. You will never bring peace...\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: ... Donald, might be able to (inaudible) Palestinians and Arabs, but it's not a real estate deal...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: ... Excuse me, I want to be able to bring peace...\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: ... Senator.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: He will never be able to do it. I think I may be able to do it, although I will say this. Probably the toughest deal of any kind is that particular deal.\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Let's move on to talk about North Korea. You raised it, Governor Kasich. The threat posed by North Korea to the United States and its sallies, the commander of American forces in South Korea said that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un would use a weapon of mass destruction if he thought his regime was being threatened. You have said the United States should start examining a strategy of regime change in North Korea.\par \par \uc2 Let's be clear. Are you talking about getting rid of Kim Jong Un?\par \par \uc2 KASICH: When you talk about regime change, Wolf, it means regime change. That's what it means. Even though there's so much chaos in North Korea right now, there's a lot of reports of uncertainty, and instability in that government.\par \par \uc2 But, look, here's what I think we ought to do -- like, immediately. And, we've been kicking the can down the road on this for, I don't know, 15 years. We should be intercepting the ships that are leaving North Korea so they're not selling this material, or this technology, or giving it to someone else.\par \par \uc2 Secondly, the same goes with the aircraft.\par \par \uc2 Thirdly, we need to slap even tougher sanctions on North Korea because we really don't have the toughest sanctions on North Korea. We ought to talk about arming South Korea with ballistic missile technology. And, of course, also Japan with ballistic missile technology. Because we're now starting to take a firm position. We have the attention of the Chinese. The Chinese are the best way to calm that regime down and get them in a position of where they back off.\par \par \uc2 But, when I say regime change, I don't have to talk exactly what that means. Look, I've been involved in national security for a long time. You don't have to spell everything out, but what I'm telling you is you look for any means you can to be able to solve that problem in North Korea, and in the meantime put the pressure on the Chinese. And, what we're doing is beginning to work against them.\par \par \uc2 They are the key to being able to settle this situation.\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: I just want to be precise, Governor Kasich, this is critically important. There are a million North Korean troops North of the DMZ...\par \par \uc2 KASICH: ... I'm very well aware of that.\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: A million South Korean troops, 28,000 U.S. troops along the DMZ, right in between. Would you risk war for a regime change?\par \par \uc2 KASICH: Wolf, again, it would depend exactly what, you know, what was happening. What the situation was. But, if there was an opportunity to remove the leader of North Korea and create stability? Because, I'll tell you, you keep kicking the can down the road we're going to face this sooner or later.\par \par \uc2 But, in the meantime, I'm also aware of the fact that there's 10 million people living in Seoul. So, you don't just run around making charges. I have put it on the table that I would leave to see regime change in North Korea.\par \par \uc2 Now, perhaps the Chinese can actually accomplish that with this man who is now currently the leader, but the fact is we have to bring everything to bear. We have to be firm, and we've got to unite those people in that part of the world to stand firmly against North Korea, and make sure we have the ballistic...\par \par \uc2 (BELL RINGING)\par \par \uc2 KASICH: ... ballistic missile technology to defend ourselves.\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Mr. Trump.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: One thing I'd like to add to what the Governor's saying, I think that we are now in a position -- are $19 trillion dollars because of the horrible omnibus budget that was approved six weeks ago, it's going to be $21 trillion dollars. We can no longer defend all of these countries, Japan, Germany, South Korea.\par \par \uc2 You order televisions, you order almost anything, you're getting it from these countries. Whether it's a Mercedes-Benz, or whether it's an air conditioning unit. They're coming out of these countries. They are making a fortune. Saudi Arabia, we are defending Saudi Arabia. Before the oil went down, now they're making less, but they're making plenty. They were making $1 billion dollars a day.\par \par \uc2 (BELL RINGING)\par \par \uc2 We defend all of these countries for peanuts. You talk about budgets. We have to start getting reimbursed for taking care of the military services for all of these countries.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 KASICH: Hey, Wolf, Wolf...\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Dr. Carson.\par \par \uc2 KASICH: Hey, Wolf, let me just say this because he mentioned this. Look, we're all in agreement that the Japanese need to do more. We're all in agreement that the Europeans need to do more, but I hate to just tell everybody we are the leader of the world and we should put the pressure on them to do their job. There is no question about it.\par \par \uc2 But, at the same time, we also have to rebuild the military. Look, I have a balanced budget plan that cuts taxes, reforms regulations, but also builds the military, puts a $100 billion dollars more in defense. We need to rebuild our defenses,\par \par \uc2 But, I must also tell you, a long time reformer of the Pentagon, we must reform that building.\par \par \uc2 (BELL RINGING)\par \par \uc2 We can't have a weapon system take 22 and a half years. We have 800,000 bureaucrats working for DOD, performing bureaucratic functions when we ought to be putting...\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: ... Thank you...\par \par \uc2 KASICH: ... these resources into strengthening the military. So, we can do it all...\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Dr. Carson, how would you deal with North Korea?\par \par \uc2 CARSON: OK. Well first of all, people say that I whine a lot because I don't get time. I'm going to whine because I didn't get asked about taxes, I didn't get asked about Israel. Hugh, you said you're going to be fair to everybody, you didn't ask me about taxes. I had something to say about that.\par \par \uc2 Now...\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Go ahead. This is your moment.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 CARSON: OK. We have a system of taxation in this country that is horribly wrong. You know, I never had an audit until I spoke at the National Prayer Breakfast, and then all of a sudden, they came in, they said we just want to look at your real estate dealings. And then they didn't find anything, so they said let's look at the whole year. And they didn't find anything, so they said let's look at the next year and the next year. They didn't find anything and they won't find anything because I'm a very honest person.\par \par \uc2 But he fact of the matter is the IRS is not honest and we need to get rid of them.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 And as far as Israel is concerned, you know, when I was there several months ago, I talked to a lot of people. I couldn't find a single one who didn't think that we had turned our backs on Israel. You know, they are a strategic partner for us but also recognize that we have a Judeo Christian foundation, and the last thing we need to do is to reject Israel. It doesn't mean that we can't be fair to other people. We can always be fair to other people, but, you know, it's like when you have a child, you know, you want to be fair to all the children around but you have a special attention for your own child.\par \par \uc2 And now, as far as North Korea is concerned, you know, Kim Jung Un is an unstable person, but he does understand strength. And I think we have to present strength to him. We should be encouraging the alliance with Japan and South Korea. We should be encouraging the placement of the THAAD, the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense, that seems to disturb not only the North Koreans but the Chinese as well.\par \par \uc2 And we also need to have a much more robust naval presence in that area, and I think we need to be developing strategic defense initiative because this man is going to have long-range missiles, he is going to have nuclear capabilities. We need to be able to defend ourselves. And lastly, we should make sure that he knows that if he ever shoots a missile at us, it will be the last thing he ever does.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Thank you. Thank you. We're going to continue with national security. Go ahead, Hugh.\par \par \uc2 HEWITT: Thank you, Wolf. Mr. Trump, we are less than 24 hours away from a ceasefire in Syria that has been brokered between the U.S. and Russia. Do you support this ceasefire?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I really don't because it not working and the countries aren't agreeing to it and the rebels aren't agreeing and Syria is not agreeing. So It's a meaningless ceasefire.\par \par \uc2 I love the idea of a ceasefire. I love the idea of -- with a total cessation. But it's not working, as you know very well. It's not working. If -- we can do what we want with Russia but nobody else is adhering to it.\par \par \uc2 So I certainly support it, I would certainly love it, but all parties have to be part of it.\par \par \uc2 HEWITT: Senator Cruz, your opinion on the ceasefire.\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: Well look. We're certainly hopeful that the violence will cease, but there's reason to be highly skeptical. Russia has enhanced its position because of Obama's weakness in the Middle East, weakness in Syria. And you know, as we're headed to November, we need no nominate a Republican candidate that can lay out a clear difference with both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton on foreign policy.\par \par \uc2 One of the real challenges with both Donald and Senator Rubio is that they have agreed over and over again with both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. So for example, in Libya, both of them agreed with the Obama/Clinton policy of toppling the government in Libya. That was a disaster. It gave the country over to radical Islamic terrorism and it endangered America.\par \par \uc2 Another example is John Kerry. John Kerry -- Senator Rubio voted to confirm John Kerry as secretary of State. I voted against him. And Donald Trump supported John Kerry against George W. Bush in 2004, gave him a check. And John Kerry has been the most anti-Israel secretary of State this country has ever seen. His diplomacy has been a disaster. And if we nominate someone who agreed with John Kerry, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton on foreign policy, we're not in a strong position to win the general election.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 HEWITT: A response, Mr. Trump, then Mr. Rubio.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Again, I think I gave them both checks to be exactly honest. I think they both liked me very much. But the fact is that ...\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: But you called for Bush to be impeached.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Well, I think Bush did a hell of a bad as far as that's concerned. You know it and so do I.\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: But you gave him a check and called for him to be impeached.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Be honest. Be honest. No, this was before. The check came early.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: But let me just tell you, Syria, he's saying that I was in favor of Syria. He said I was in favor of Libya? I never discussed that subject. I was in favor of Libya? We would be so much better off if Gadhafi were in charge right now.\par \par \uc2 If these politicians went to the beach and didn't do a thing, and we had Saddam Hussein and if we had Gadhafi in charge, instead of having terrorism all over the place, we'd be -- at least they killed terrorists, all right?\par \par \uc2 And I'm not saying they were good because they were bad, they were really bad, but we don't know what we're getting. You look at Libya right now, ISIS, as we speak, is taking over their oil. As we speak, it's a total mess.\par \par \uc2 We would have been better off if the politicians took a day off instead of going into war.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 HEWITT: Senator Rubio.\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: Yes, a couple of points. Number one, on the Libya situation, we didn't topple Gadhafi, the Libyan people toppled Gadhafi. The only choice before America that this president had to make is, does it happen quickly or does it take a long time?\par \par \uc2 And I argued if it takes a long time, you're going to have rebel forces emerge like these radical Islamists to take advantage of the vacuum. And that's what happened. That's where the term "lead from behind" came. And that's the foreign policy that apparently Senator Cruz appears to agree with.\par \par \uc2 On John Kerry, yes, you know why, because every day John Kerry wasn't appointed was another day Hillary Clinton was still in charge of the State Department. And she was absolutely horrible.\par \par \uc2 I couldn't imagine that they were going to find somebody even worse than her, but this president never ceases to amaze.\par \par \uc2 (LAUGHTER)\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: And the last point I would make on South Korea, now this is important, because we're asking to be commander-in-chief. Donald is asking to be commander-in-chief. And he's saying these guys need to do more.\par \par \uc2 South Korea contributes $800 million a year to that effort. And Japan contributes as well. And here's why our commitment to that regional security is so critical, Donald, because if we walk away from them, both Japan and South Korea will become nuclear weapons powers.\par \par \uc2 They can do that very quickly. And that's what they will do if the American defense agreements wither away, which is why we have to rebuild the military, but why we can't walk away from our Asia-Pacific defense status.\par \par \uc2 HEWITT: Mr. Trump.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I never said walk away. I wouldn't want to walk away. I want them to pay us much more money. We cannot afford to subsidize...\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: How much?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: A lot. I'll negotiate a lot more money than you'll ever get.\par \par \uc2 As far as John Kerry is concerned, there has been no tougher critic of this man, I think he negotiated one of the worst deals in the history of our country, the Iran deal, where they get their $150 billion and all of the other things that take place.\par \par \uc2 It is a disaster for this country, and speaking of Israel, it's a disaster for Israel. I'm no fan of John Kerry.\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Hold on, hold on, Governor.\par \par \uc2 Senator Cruz.\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: You know, it's interesting, Donald just said that he never came out in favor of toppling Gadhafi in Libya. Well, he stated that in an interview that will be on our Web site, tedcruz.org.\par \par \uc2 You can see and hear the exact words from Donald's mouth. And I assume when he sees that interview, maybe he forgot about it, but I assume Donald will apologize where he sees that he said exactly that.\par \par \uc2 With regard to John Kerry, I will say John Kerry's foreign policy has been a disaster for decades. That's why I voted against him when he came up. And the fact that Donald Trump would write him a check and support him against George W. Bush shows exceptionally poor foreign policy judgment.\par \par \uc2 And I'll give one more example on Israel. When the Obama administration canceled civilian air flights into the national of Israel, when Hamas was raining rockets down on them, I publicly asked, is this an economic boycott against Israel?\par \par \uc2 The next day Michael Bloomberg, another New York billionaire, got on a plane, a commercial flight, and flew to Israel from London. Together the heat and light that was put on the State Department was so great that within 36 hours they lifted the ban on air flights into Israel.\par \par \uc2 During that entire battle, and indeed during every battle on Israel the natural question is, where was Donald? If this is something he cares about, why has he supported anti-Israel politicians from Jimmy Carter to Hillary Clinton to John Kerry for four decades?\par \par \uc2 If you care about Israel, you don't write checks to politicians who are undermining Israel. Instead you stand and support the national security of America and the alliance with Israel.\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 KASICH: There's a critical point that needs to be made here.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Governor, Governor, Governor, he attacked Mr. Trump.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump has a right to respond.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Well, look, my response is very simple. There is nobody on this stage that has done more for Israel than I have. Nobody. You might say, you might talk, you're politicians, all talk, no action.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I've been watching it all my life. You are all talk and no action.\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: Then name one specific thing you've done.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: What I've seen up here -- I mean, first of all, this guy is a choke artist, and this guy is a liar. You have a combination...\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: This guy always goes for...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: You have a combination of factors. He can't do it...\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: This is so typical.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: ... for the obvious reason, and he can't do it because he doesn't know how to tell the truth. Other than that, I rest my case.\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: One at a time, gentlemen.\par \par \uc2 Governor Kasich, you have the floor. Governor...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: You will have a response. But I promised Governor Kasich he could respond.\par \par \uc2 CARSON: Can somebody attack me, please?\par \par \uc2 (LAUGHTER)\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 KASICH: There's something -- I want to -- I want to point out something here today that is -- it's so critically important -- about how the Obama administration has really done such a ridiculous, feckless job here in foreign policy.\par \par \uc2 First of all, we should have been supporting the rebels long ago. They could have taken Assad out, and because we did nothing, the Russians are in, and they're sitting in the catbird seat.\par \par \uc2 We should have been helping them. I'm thankful that the aid trucks are finally getting into Syria. But the fact is, had we had acted, we would have solved that problem.\par \par \uc2 Now, let's talk about Libya. Libya didn't go down because there was some people revolution. Hillary Clinton, Samantha Power and all these other people convinced the president to undermine Gadhafi. They undermined him, and now they have created a cesspool in Libya.\par \par \uc2 And let me just say to you -- we have ISIS beginning get -- get a foothold in Libya. We're gonna have to deal with it. There are not many major cities in Libya. They're on the coast, which -- mostly, it's desert, but it's a problem.\par \par \uc2 Then we have ISIS in -- in Syria, and we have ISIS in Iraq. Because this administration has not had a strong and firm foreign policy, we are going to inherit -- one of us here is going to inherit a total mess...\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: All right...\par \par \uc2 KASICH: ... and we're going to have to work our way out of it, including...\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Let's continue.\par \par \uc2 KASICH: ... the need to arm the Ukrainians. They have been ignored, and we need to help them as well...\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Let us continue.\par \par \uc2 KASICH: ... and assert ourselves as America.\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Let's continue the questioning on ISIS. Maria.\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: Hold on, Wolf. You said I got a response.\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: You'll have a chance. Maria will pick up...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: Hold on. He called me a liar. You're saying I can't respond to being called a liar?\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Go ahead and respond.\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: You know, what we're seeing with Donald is actually the pattern of Washington -- the pattern of Washington deal makers, which is they make promises, they break their words, and then when anyone calls them on it, they call you a liar.\par \par \uc2 And so that's Donald's pattern over and over again. He said, for example, seven months ago -- this is Donald speaking, quote -- "I, Donald Trump, was a member of the establishment."\par \par \uc2 There's a reason Harry Reid thinks he's the best Republican up here. There's a reason Jimmy Carter said he would support Donald Trump over me, because he said Donald Trump is malleable, he has no fixed set of beliefs...\par \par \uc2 (BELL RINGS)\par \par \uc2 ... whereas Ted Cruz is not malleable. And every time anyone points at Donald's actual record...\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Thank you.\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: ... what he said on national television, Donald yells "liar." Let me tell you something -- falsely accusing someone of lying is itself a lie...\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Go ahead, Mr. Trump.\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: ... and it's something Donald does daily.\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Go ahead, Mr. Trump.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I watched -- I watched...\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: ... the lobbyists. I watched what this man did to Dr. Ben Carson, who I respect, in Iowa, where he said that Ben Carson is out of the race -- he has left Iowa and he's out of the race. And I thought it was disgraceful.\par \par \uc2 And got a lot of votes because of that -- a lot of votes. Took them away from Ben Carson. I watched that. Probably took them away from me, too. But I watched it.\par \par \uc2 I also watched where he did a forum that looked like it came right out of a government agency, and it said on top, "Voter Violation," and then it graded you...\par \par \uc2 (BELL RINGS)\par \par \uc2 ... and it scared the hell out of people, and it said the only way you clear up the violation, essentially, is to go and vote for Ted Cruz. I watched that fraudulent document, and I said it's the worst thing I've ever seen in politics.\par \par \uc2 (BELL RINGS)\par \par \uc2 To me, that was even worse than what he did to Ben.\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Senator Cruz...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I know politicians -- I know politicians, believe it or not, better than you do. And it's not good.\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: I believe it. No, no. I believe you know politicians much better than I do, because for 40 years, you've been funding liberal Democratic politicians. And by the way...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I funded you. I funded him. Can you believe it?\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: ... the reason is -- you're welcome to have the check back.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I funded this guy. I gave him a check.\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: Yeah, you gave me $5,000.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I gave him a check. He never funded me.\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: And -- and by the way, let's be clear.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Donald claims -- Donald claims to care about...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: You know why? I didn't want to, but he sent me his book with his autograph...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: Donald. Donald. Donald. I understand rules are very hard for you. They're very confusing.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Mr. Trump, you're doing a great job. I have his book.\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Thank you -- thank you for the book. Go ahead.\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: Donald, you can get back on your meds now.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: This is a lot of fun up here tonight, I have to tell you.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Thank -- thank you for the book. I really appreciate (ph).\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: Donald -- Donald, relax.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Go ahead. I'm relaxed. You're the basket case.\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 Go ahead.\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: Donald...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Go ahead. Don't get nervous.\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: (inaudible)...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Go ahead.\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: I promise you, Donald, there's nothing about you...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I've seen you.\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: ... that makes anyone nervous.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: You're losing so badly you -- I want to...\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: You know, people are actually watching this at home.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: ... I -- you don't know what's happening.\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Gentlemen, gentlemen.\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: Wolf, I'm going to ask my time not be deducted when he's yelling at me.\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: You've gotta stop this.\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: The latest debate -- gentlemen, please.\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: Hold on, I'm going to get my answer. He doesn't get to yell the whole time. BLITZER: I want to move -- I want to move on. These are the rules.\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: Excuse me, he called me a liar, then interrupted the whole time. Am I allowed to...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: Wolf, do I not get a response? Do I not get a response without being interrupted?\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: You'll get -- you'll get plenty of response, so stand by.\par \par \uc2 CARSON: My name was mentioned.\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: I want to talk -- I want to talk about ISIS right now, and the federal government -- how much best to keep Americans safe from ISIS.\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: There's a huge battle underway right now between the tech giant Apple and the federal government. The federal government wants Apple to unlock the phone used by that San Bernardino terrorist to prevent future attacks. Apple has refused, saying it would compromise the security of all of its customers. And just this afternoon, they went to court to block the judge's order.\par \par \uc2 Dana Bash, pick up the questioning.\par \par \uc2 BASH: Senator Rubio, you say it's complicated, and that, quote, "Apple isn't necessarily wrong to refuse the court order." Why shouldn't investigators have everything at their disposal?\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: No, in fact what I have said is the only thing -- the FBI made this very clear 48 hours ago -- the only thing they are asking of Apple is that Apple allow them to use their own systems in the FBI to try to guess the password of the San Bernardino killer. Apple initially came out saying, "We're being ordered to create a back door to an encryption device." That is not accurate.\par \par \uc2 The only thing they're being asked to do, and the FBI made this very clear about 48 hours ago, is allow us to disable the self- destruct mode that's in the Apple phone so that we can try to guess using our own systems what the password of this killer was.\par \par \uc2 And I think they should comply with that. If that's all they're asking for, they are not asking for Apple to create a back door to encryption.\par \par \uc2 BASH: So just to be clear, you did say on CNN a couple of weeks ago this is a complicated issue; Apple is not necessarily wrong here.\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: Because at the time, Apple was portraying that the court order was to create a back door to an encryption device.\par \par \uc2 BASH: But just to be clear -- just to be clear, if you are president, would you instruct your Justice Department to force Apple to comply or not?\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: To comply with an order that says that they have to allow the FBI the opportunity to try to guess the password?\par \par \uc2 BASH: Correct.\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: Absolutely. That Apple phone didn't even belong to the killer. It belonged to the killer's employee (sic) who have agreed to allow him to try to do this. That is all they're asking them to do is to disable the self-destruct mode or the auto-erase mode on one phone in the entire world. But Apple doesn't want to do it because they think it hurts their brand.\par \par \uc2 Well, let me tell you, their brand is not superior to the national security of the United States of America.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 BASH: Senator Cruz, Apple CEO Tim Cook says this would be bad for America. Where do you stand: national security or personal privacy?\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: Well, as you know, at that same CNN forum, both Marco and I were asked this question. His answer, he was on both sides of the fence. He's now agreeing with me. And so I'm glad.\par \par \uc2 What I said is yes, Apple should be forced to comply with this court order. Why? Because under the Fourth Amendment, a search and seizure is reasonable if it has judicial authorization and probable cause. In this instance, the order is not put a back door in everyone's cell phone. If that was the order, that order would be problematic because it would compromise security and safety for everyone.\par \par \uc2 I would agree with Apple on that broad policy question. But on the question of unlocking this cell phone of a terrorist, we should enforce the court order and find out everyone that terrorist at San Bernardino talked to on the phone, texted with, e-mailed. And absolutely, Apple doesn't have a right to defy a valid court order in a terrorism investigation.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 BASH: Dr. Carson, Tim Cook, again, the CEO of Apple, says that this would be bad for America. What do you think?\par \par \uc2 CARSON: I think allowing terrorist to get away with things is bad for America.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 You know, we have the -- we have a Constitution. We have a Fourth Amendment. It guards us against illegal and unreasonable search and seizure. But we have mechanisms in place with the judicial system that will allow us to gain material that is necessary to benefit the nation as a whole or the community as a whole. And that's why we have FISA courts and things of that nature.\par \par \uc2 So absolutely, I would -- I would expect Apple to comply with the court order. If they don't comply with that, you're encouraging chaos in our system.\par \par \uc2 BASH: Mr. Trump...\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE) KASICH: I want to weigh in on this please. I want to just tell you that the problem is not right now between the administration and Apple. You know what the problem is? Where's the president been? You sit down in a back room and you sit down with the parties and you get this worked out. You don't litigate this on the front page of the New York Times, where everybody in the world is reading about their dirty laundry out here.\par \par \uc2 The president of the United States should be convening a meeting, should have convened a meeting with Apple and our security forces. And then you know what you do when you're the president? You lock the door and you say you're not coming out until you reach an agreement that both gives the security people what they need and protects the rights of Americans. This is a failure of his leadership to get this done as an executive should be doing it.\par \par \uc2 And I'll tell you, that's why you want a governor. I do this all the time. And we reach agreements all the time. Because as an executive, you've got to solve problems instead of fighting on the front page of the newspaper.\par \par \uc2 ARRASAS: Thank you, Governor.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 KASICH: Thank you.\par \par \uc2 ARRARAS: Mr. Trump, you have been very vocal about securing the Mexican border, but ISIS has called upon its supporters to conduct attacks on our neighbor to the North, Canada.\par \par \uc2 As a matter of fact, U.S. officials have warned that it is the Canadian border which is the most significant threat. You have said that you will not build a wall in Canada. When it comes to national security, and the threat of terrorism, why does Mexico need a wall, and Canada doesn't? Isn't that, like, closing the front door, and leaving the back door open?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: First of all, you're talking about a border that's many, many times longer. You're talking about a massive border.\par \par \uc2 We have far less problem with that border than we do with our Southern border, and tremendous amounts -- you know, I won, I had the privilege of winning by a landslide, by the way, New Hampshire.\par \par \uc2 You go to New Hampshire, the first thing they talk about is heroin and drugs pouring in. And, you wouldn't think this beautiful place -- it's beautiful. With the trees and the roads, and the countryside. Their biggest problem is heroin, and it's such a shame to see it.\par \par \uc2 They're pouring in from the Southern border, so I'm talking about great security. I'm talking about a wall that can absolutely be built, and I'll build it on time, on budget. It'll be a very high wall, a great wall. It's going to be built, it's going to be built. It's going to be paid for by Canada, by the way -- maybe I'll get Canada to pay? Got to be paid for by Mexico.\par \par \uc2 The problem with Canada, you're talking about a massively long piece. You're talking about a border that would be about four times longer. It would be very, very hard to do, and we -- it is not our biggest problem. I don't care what anyone says. It is not our big problem. Our big problem is not only people coming in, and in many cases the wrong people, it's the tremendous amount of drugs that are coming in.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 ARRARAS: I want to talk to you, Senator Rubio, about Puerto Rico. As you know, Puerto Rico's in the midst of financial collapse, unable to pay it's debt of $72 billion dollars. Puerto Rico is asking for bankruptcy protection which would give Puerto Rico, and Puerto Ricans, which are U.S. citizens, you know that -- the tools to restructure the debt. That is the same debt the other 50 states have.\par \par \uc2 You oppose granting Puerto Rico that bankruptcy protection. You say that it is only a last resort measure, but the government of Puerto Rico has said that bankruptcy is it's last resort. That that's where they are now. How do you explain this very strong stance to the hundreds of thousands of Puerto Ricans that vote across the U.S. , and particularly in your state of Florida?\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: Sure, because bankruptcy doesn't work unless you change the way you're operating, or you're going to be bankrupt again. And, the problem with Puerto Rico is it's economy is not growing. It has a massive exodus of professionals and others that are leaving to my home state of Florida, and all over the country.\par \par \uc2 They're coming to the mainland from Puerto Rico because the economy there is not growing, it's too expensive to do business there. The tax rate is too high. The government regulations are too extensive.\par \par \uc2 This year alone, with all the problems they're having, they barely cut their budget from one year to the next. So, I think the leadership on the island has to show their willingness to get their house in order and put in place measures allow the economy there to grow again. If the economy of Puerto Rico does not grow they will never generate the revenue to pay this debt, or the billions of dollars in unfunded liabilities that they have on their books of promises they've made to future generations to make payments.\par \par \uc2 So, yes, if they do all of those things then we can explore the use of bankruptcy protection, but not as the first resort, which is what they're asking for, because it will not solve the problems on the island and you're going to continue to see hundreds of thousands of people leave that beautiful place, and coming to the mainland.\par \par \uc2 They're United States citizens, they're obviously entitled to do so, and we welcome them, but we would also prefer to see a Puerto Rico that once again is growing economically, and is robust. And, the leaders in charge there now are doing a terrible job.\par \par \uc2 Their previous governor, Louis Fortuno was doing a great job until he barely lost that election to...\par \par \uc2 (BELL RINGING)\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: ... to someone who has taken a big government stance (ph) once again...\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: ... Senator, thank you very much.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: I want our viewers to stay with us right now, including the last pitch in the final debate before Super Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)\par \par \uc2 (COMMERCIAL BREAK)\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Welcome back to the University of Houston. It's time now for closing statements. All of you will have 30 seconds. Dr. Carson, we'll start with you.\par \par \uc2 CARSON: Well first of all, I want people to think about what kind of leader do you want and what kind of person do you want your kids to emulate. Think about that.\par \par \uc2 Secondly, several years ago, a movie was made about these hands. These hands by the grace of God have saved many lives and healed many families. And I'm asking you tonight, America, to join hands with me to heal, inspire and revive America. If not us, who? And if not now, when?\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Governor Kasich.\par \par \uc2 KASICH: Well, the last USA Today poll had me beating Hillary Clinton by 11 points, more than anybody on this stage. Secondly, I hope you saw tonight that executive experience really matters. It matters in terms of growing our economy, balancing budgets, cutting taxes, reforming regulations. I've done it in Washington, I've done it in Ohio, and I can go back to Washington and do it again.\par \par \uc2 But I hope you also noticed tonight that I do have the foreign policy experience, not just a few years, but a lot of years in working with some of the great, great minds in this country to develop the expertise, the confidence, the firmness, the toughness and the ability to bring people together.\par \par \uc2 I hope you all think about giving me your vote. I would appreciate it very much. And I tell you, we won't have to spend time figuring what we're going to do. I will hit the ground running and we will get America moving again. Thank you all very much.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Senator Rubio. RUBIO: Well, thank you for having us tonight. You know, this campaign has come a long way. It was just a few months ago there were 15 or 11 us on the stage and now it's narrowed and the votes are starting to count. And we have an incredible decision to make, not just about the direction of America, but the identity of our party and of the conservative movement.\par \par \uc2 RUBIO: The time for games is over.\par \par \uc2 I know you've had a lot of choices to make, but now it's time to narrow it down. And I'm asking you to get behind me, go on our Web site and join you our effort, marcorubio.com, so we can bring an end to this silliness, this looniness, and once again re-embrace all the things that made America and the Republican Party the bearer of the conservative movement in this country.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Senator Cruz.\par \par \uc2 CRUZ: Washington deals are bankrupting this country. There are several deal-makers on this stage but there is only one person who has consistently stood up to both parties, fighting for the American people against the Washington deals.\par \par \uc2 If I'm elected president, on the first day in office I will rescind every single illegal and unconstitutional executive action. I will instruct the Department of Justice to open an investigation into Planned Parenthood and prosecute any criminal violations.\par \par \uc2 I will instruct every federal agency that the persecution of religious liberty ends today. I will rip to shreds the Iranian -- catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal. And I will begin the process of moving the American embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.\par \par \uc2 We will repeal Obamacare, abolish of IRS, secure the border, and bring back jobs.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Mr. Trump.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Thank you.\par \par \uc2 Nobody knows politicians better than I do. They're all talk, they're no action, nothing gets done. I've watched it for years. Take a look at what's happening to our country.\par \par \uc2 All of the things that I've been talking about, whether it's trade, whether it's building up our depleted military, whether it's taking care of our vets, whether it's getting rid of Common Core, which is a disaster, or knocking out Obamacare and coming up with something so much better, I will get it done. Politicians will never, ever get it done. And we will make America great again. Thank you.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 BLITZER: Mr. Trump, thank you.\par \par \uc2 And thanks to each of the candidates, on behalf of everyone here at CNN and Telemundo. We also want to thank the Republican National Committee and the University of Houston. My thanks also to Hugh Hewitt, Maria Celeste, and Dana Bash.\par \par \uc2 Super Tuesday is only five days away.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020160226ec2q000ul\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 HOUSTON -- After \uc2 Sen. Marco Rubio\uc2  of Florida was pronounced the winner of Thursday night's GOP debate in Houston, his strategist Todd Harris was asked whether the attacks on \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  had been a little glib. Rubio seemed pre-loaded with zingers -- Trump would be "selling watches in Manhattan" if he hadn't "inherited $200 million" -- and his best moment had come when he chided Trump for repeating and repeating a one-sentence plan to replace the Affordable Care Act.\par \par \uc2 "I'm not sure that we were saying any of that to actually hurt Trump," Harris said. "I think that the purpose of all of that was to show that Marco can mix it up as well as Trump can, which is something that no one else on that stage has been willing to do. Was it a substantive argument? No. But as we've seen from most, if not all, of the media coverage over the past eight months, trying to wage a battle of substance against Trump is a pretty futile effort."\par \par \uc2 Rubio, in other words, had beaten Trump by descending to his level. Paradoxically, this was what conservative intellectuals had been clamoring for, and for months. Sen. Ted Cruz's attacks on the Trump record did not land quite like Rubio's attacks on Trump, the brand.\par \par \uc2 Attacking that brand had become an obsession on the right. The Federalist's Ben Domenech beseeched candidates to attack the front-runner in "Trumpian terms." In a column that defined the genre -- the "well, if I were designing anti-Trump ads" genre -- Ross Douthat urged conservatives to expose Trump as a failure.\par \par \uc2 "Tell them about all the money he inherited from his daddy," he wrote. "Tell them about the bailouts that saved him from ruin. Tell them about all his cratered companies. Then find people who suffered from those fiascos \u8212\'20\'14 workers laid off following his bankruptcies, homeowners who bought through Trump Mortgage, people who ponied up for sham degrees from Trump University."\par \par \uc2 This was what Rubio did, in a closed-door Wednesday fundraiser and from the first moments of the debate. As soon as he got the chance, he cited "a report in one of the newspapers" that Trump had "hired a significant number of people from other countries to take jobs that Americans could have filled." That was not a policy attack.\par \par \uc2 In the next round, Trump was asked a question in his wheelhouse -- how he could get Mexico to pay for a wall on the border. Rubio, again, pivoted to the personal: "If he builds the wall the way he built Trump Towers, he'll be using \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  labor to do it."\par \par \uc2 And in the next round, the one in which Rubio mocked Trump for "repeating himself," Rubio actually argued against a policy he himself supported. "What is your plan?" he asked, baiting Trump into repeating himself. "I understand the lines around the state, whatever that means." Rubio, like virtually every Republican, wants to allow the purchase of insurance over state lines as part of an Obamacare replacement. But in real time, he framed this as a glib idea Trump endorsed because he didn't "follow this stuff very closely." The basic critique was not that Trump's policy was wrong; it was that he was stupid and didn't know what he wanted to do.\par \par \uc2 Trump, while coherent (this is the bar we set now), missed every chance to rebut this by attacking Rubio's brand. He could have followed fact-checkers and derided Rubio\u160\'00\'A0for taking credit for the restriction on the Affordable Care Act "risk pool." He could have attacked Rubio over his membership in the Gang of Eight, the failure of which he is never able to convincingly explain. But Trump never mentioned the phrase "Gang of Eight" at all. The argument was not about the two men's stances; it was about whether Trump was a failure.\par \par \uc2 That, say conservatives, is the attack that can work where umpteen accountability attacks have failed. Jeb Bush got absolutely nowhere attacking Trump for being brash and "insulting his way to the presidency." That was on brand for Trump. Cruz had little success shaming Trump for his heresies, to the extent when Trump could defend eminent domain at length, Cruz could attack him for it on the air, and no votes seemed to move.\par \par \uc2 Why would votes move now? The Rubio campaign leans into the argument -- it saw what happened when Rubio made a substance error, repeating a stock phrase as \uc2 Chris Christie\uc2  mocked him. The campaign spent a few days arguing that the media over-interpreted that. Since the night of Rubio's poor New Hampshire finish, it is a catechism that the candidate fumbled, and that he now understands how to make other people fumble.\par \par \uc2 "It was the same thing with Marco, when Christie came at him," said Rubio's campaign manager Terry Sullivan. "No one had any issues with Marco repeating the same thing a couple of times over, until Christie said it, and then it was front-page news. Trump has done an effective job at doing that to other candidates. Now Marco is doing it to \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 ."\par \par \uc2 To his credit, Cruz also traded in some of the true-conservative attacks for sustained scrutiny of Trump's for-profit university fraud case. But he and Rubio teamed up in perhaps the least effective Trump attack.\par \par \uc2 "Did you say if you want people to die on the streets, if you don't support socialized health care, you have no heart?" asked Cruz.\par \par \uc2 "Correct," said Trump. "I will not let people die on the streets if I'm president."\par \par \uc2 "This is a Republican debate, right?" asked Rubio.\par \par \uc2 He was arguing that Trump was using populist, Democratic rhetoric to attack conservatives. That was the material that hadn't been working. After the debate, Rubio's team was much more comfortable talking about the flat-out mockery, which might work.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020160226ec2q004bo\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Sen. Marco Rubio\uc2  (R-Fla.) scored an impressive TKO against \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  last night. More than near-unanimous praise from conservative and mainstream media, however, he accomplished a number of critical tasks in his goal to dislodge Trump from his perch atop the GOP presidential primary race:\par \par \uc2 1. Rubio signaled a new phase in the campaign. Today his super PAC is out with new ads excoriating Trump for trampling on ordinary people (and taking them for "fools") and for knowing nothing about foreign policy. Rubio's debate performance served as a starting gun in the first concerted effort in the 2016 campaign to systematically go after Trump. Rubio kept up the barrage this morning, asserting, "A con artist is about to take over the conservative movement and the Republican Party and we have to put a stop to it. He is wholly unprepared to be president of the United States." Look for "a con artist who spent years sticking it to working people" to be used a lot in the days ahead.\par \par \uc2 2. By so dominating the debate -- without attacking Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) -- Rubio went a long way toward setting this up as a two-man race between himself and Trump.\par \par \uc2 3. Rubio calmed donors and supporters who were frantic about Trump's rise. He showed that Trump is vulnerable and that he is the one to pop Trump's bubble.\par \par \uc2 4. Rubio made Trump look foolish, something that might actually have resonance with those inclined to pick Trump.\par \par \uc2 5. Rubio got under Trump's skin, rattling him for one of the few times in the campaign.\par \par \uc2 6. Rubio created viral moments -- e.g. "Now he's repeating himself," "Look it up -- 'Trump Polish workers,' " "If he builds the wall the way he built Trump Towers, he'll be using \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  labor to do it, " "A deal is not a deal when you're dealing with terrorists."\par \par \uc2 7. \u160\'00\'A0Rubio entirely ignored Ohio Gov. John \u160\'00\'A0Kasich and Ben Carson, who looked as though they did not belong on the stage. The argument for Carson's and Kasich's prompt exit got a boost.\par \par \uc2 8. Given how badly outwitted and rattled Trump was, concerns about how he will stand up to the Clinton attack machine will increase. All those arguments Rubio and Cruz deployed will be used against Trump should he be the nominee.\par \par \uc2 9. Rubio vindicated his team's strategic plan, namely that the field had to narrow and Cruz had to be disarmed before unloading on Trump. In refusing to signal their plans to go on offense, Rubio and his team bamboozled the press and surprised Trump.\par \par \uc2 10. Rubio will dominate the political talk through the weekend, giving him, he hopes, a much-needed lift to draw close to Trump and away from Cruz on Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020160226ec2q004k0\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Well, here we are, at the last Republican debate before the next eight hundred debates -- and the actual last debate before Super Tuesday. Jeb! is gone. ("His best performance ever!" \uc2 Twitter\uc2  proclaimed, because we human beings are cruel.) But perhaps the only winning move on Thursday night was not to play.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Here, for anyone who lacked the stamina for another debate, is a rough summary of what happened. As is usual in these, the end times, candidates' actual words are in italics.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Wolf Blitzer: Hello and welcome to the GOP debate. I will be moderating this debate. Kind of. Opening statements?\par \par \uc2 Ben Carson: If someone had tried to describe today's America to you thirty years ago, you would have listened in disbelief. Robot cats! Trees made from human skin! And \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 's the president!\u160\'00\'A0What a time\u160\'00\'A0to be alive!\par \par \uc2 John Kasich: My father\u160\'00\'A0carried mail on his back. His father was a coal miner. They would have been amazed to see me up here on this stage tonight, not because it would never have occurred to them that their son and grandson\u160\'00\'A0could run for president but because they thought that with my poll numbers, surely I would have dropped out\u160\'00\'A0by now.\par \par \uc2 Marco Rubio\uc2 : AMERICA! COME WITH ME IF YOU WANT TO LIVE!\par \par \uc2 Ted Cruz: Wait, you're here to stop \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 ? I thought I was here to stop \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Trump: I am just here to have a good time. (pulls out\u160\'00\'A0an old flintlock musket, fires it, and kills an endangered puppy. The crowd cheers) I am having a blast! Nothing I say or do matters, and no one can do anything to me.\u160\'00\'A0I am no longer just Jeb Bush's nightmare! I am the\u160\'00\'A0nightmare of everyone on this stage!\par \par \uc2 Wolf: Talk about immigration!\par \par \uc2 Rubio: Donald,\u160\'00\'A0you criticized Mitt Romney for using the term "self-deportation."\par \par \uc2 Trump: I criticized Mitt Romney for lots of reasons. Pssh, look at the guy.\par \par \uc2 Rubio: Also, try the search term "Trump polish workers." (points) See, Ben Carson's Googling it!\par \par \uc2 Carson: I'm playing Candy Crush, actually.\par \par \uc2 Rubio: Kasich?\par \par \uc2 Kasich: Huh, when you type in "Trump polish workers" it suggests "vote \uc2 Marco Rubio\uc2 " and "six different ways you can tell Rubio is not a robot" and "Okay, Rubio is a robot, but he's from the future and he is YOUR ONLY CHANCE, AMERICA."\par \par \uc2 Rubio: PLEASE. LET ME SAVE YOU. I am only sweating because I HAVE SEEN WHAT THE STAKES ARE.\par \par \uc2 Trump: Hush now, Marco. (Audience applauds.) Everyone, watch me strangle this rare bird with my hands, which are a NORMAL SIZE. (Trump does so. Wild cheering.) Look, what you said was very nice and very interesting, probably, but I was not listening. I've hired people. Have you ever hired people?\par \par \uc2 Rubio: Maybe not, but\u160\'00\'A0in the timeline where I came from\u160\'00\'A0President Rubio hires lots of people and ushers in a golden age.\par \par \uc2 Cruz: I'm just sad that people think that nobody knew about\u160\'00\'A0illegal immigration before \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 . I was into the issue of illegal immigration BEFORE it was cool.\par \par \uc2 Trump: Shut up, Ted. No one likes you. Not a single person. Raise your hand if you like Ted. (pause) Nobody? Now make a noise if you think Ted is a nightmare of a human being. (Crowd laughs, applauds.)\u160\'00\'A0Now pelt him with raw vegetables!\par \par \uc2 Cruz: YOU THINK THAT BOTHERS ME? I BATHE IN YOUR HATRED! I'VE BEEN LOATHED BY PEOPLE SINCE BEFORE YOU WERE A TWINKLE\u160\'00\'A0IN YOUR DADDY'S\u160\'00\'A0LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT!\par \par \uc2 Rubio: (earnestly, to Cruz, in an undertone) What timeline are you from? What are you trying to accomplish here?\par \par \uc2 Blitzer: Donald, the president of Mexico said he wouldn't pay for your, quote, "effing wall."\par \par \uc2 Trump: The wall just got TEN FEET higher and a BILLION dollars more expensive! The wall has moved from the realm of fantasy, past several Bernie Sanders budget proposals, and across the border into Gumdrop\u160\'00\'A0Land, a beautiful place where I am building a very tasteful casino.\par \par \uc2 Rubio: If you build the wall, you will be using \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  labor to do it. \uc2 Google\uc2  this, everyone! Also,\u160\'00\'A0\uc2 Google\uc2  "Trump University!"\par \par \uc2 Carson: I just googled it and it sounds like a wonderful deal! How do I sign up?\par \par \uc2 (Rubio slams his head repeatedly into the podium. A red light starts to flash behind his ear. He slams his head again and it turns off.)\par \par \uc2 Rubio: If Trump had not inherited all that money, he would be selling watches!\par \par \uc2 Trump: What's wrong with selling watches? I have a whole armful of huge, classy watches. I'll sell you one now, if you like.\par \par \uc2 Cruz: Marco, why are you so wrong on ethanol?\par \par \uc2 Rubio: Ted, what are you doing? You're supposed to be attacking him, not me!\par \par \uc2 Mar\u237\'00\'EDa Celeste Arrar\u225\'00\'E1s: Yes, what he said.\par \par \uc2 Hugh Hewitt: Talk about Supreme Court nominees.\par \par \uc2 Trump: I will not nominate bad, disappointing people like Ted Cruz's John Roberts.\par \par \uc2 Cruz: For the last time, I had no choice! I would not have nominated him! I was just doing what George W. Bush wanted!\par \par \uc2 Carson: Hey, wait, speaking of George W., Jeb's not here! Where'd he go? Did we start without him by mistake?\par \par \uc2 Hewitt: How about you, Dr. Carson? Who would you nominate?\par \par \uc2 Carson: "As president, I would go through and I would look at what a person's life has been. What have they done in the past? What kind of judgments have they made? What kind of associations do they have? That will tell you a lot more than an interview will tell you.\u160\'00\'A0The fruit salad of their life is what I will look at."\par \par \uc2 Hewitt: I'm sorry, what?\par \par \uc2 Carson: Justice Ginsburg, the fruit salad of her life is full of\u160\'00\'A0those large irregular pear slices that can really overwhelm the rest of the contents of the salad. You can't have that. Whereas Justice Alito\u160\'00\'A0has a good ratio of\u160\'00\'A0pineapple, melon -- and you know that's real juice he's got in there, not syrup. That's important. Now Kagan, that is more difficult, but I think there is an assortment of raspberries, maybe a lingonberry. I would have to do some research.\par \par \uc2 Hewitt: I wish you got to talk more.\par \par \uc2 Rubio: I don't.\par \par \uc2 Dana Bash: Donald, do you know what you would replace Obamacare with?\par \par \uc2 Trump: No.\par \par \uc2 Bash: Do you understand how health insurance works?\par \par \uc2 Trump:\u160\'00\'A0I\u160\'00\'A0would get rid of the lines around the states.\par \par \uc2 Bash: Can you describe what an exchange is or how you would run it or say any sentence about healthcare or insurance that is not immediately, obviously incorrect?\par \par \uc2 Trump: Look, I read an article, I think, about this, where it said that they had some very interesting, some things, that if they got rid of something, things would be a lot less, you know. Very interesting stuff. And I will do that thing.\par \par \uc2 (Applause)\par \par \uc2 Bash: Really, audience? Really?\par \par \uc2 Trump: A lot of my best friends are insurance companies.\par \par \uc2 Rubio: You actually don't know how Obamacare works, do you? Say something that isn't "I'll get rid of\u160\'00\'A0the lines."\par \par \uc2 Trump:\u160\'00\'A0I'll\u160\'00\'A0get RID\u160\'00\'A0of\u160\'00\'A0the LINES.\par \par \uc2 Rubio: How are you visualizing this in your mind?\u160\'00\'A0Do you think this is, like, a big map where you just erase something?\par \par \uc2 Trump: (aggressively, but you can tell he's trying to find out the real answer, like a kid on the playground responding to a surprising taunt\u160\'00\'A0about human anatomy): Is it not?\par \par \uc2 Rubio: But then what?\par \par \uc2 Trump: Well, we'll erase those lines. We'll erase them, and they'll be gone. Poof!\par \par \uc2 Rubio: And then --\par \par \uc2 Trump: Well, without the lines, there'll be competition. There won't be lines.\par \par \uc2 Rubio: Stop repeating yourself.\par \par \uc2 Trump: Stop repeating YOURSELF.\par \par \uc2 Rubio: You have literally five things that you say. "Everyone's dumb, he's gonna make America great again\u8230\'20\'26\u160\'00\'A0We're going to win, win win, he's winning in the polls\u8230\'20\'26\u160\'00\'A0And the lines around the state. Every night."\par \par \uc2 Trump: That is not true. I also say, "Huge" and "Great."\par \par \uc2 Bash: Donald, do you want to talk about your plan?\par \par \uc2 Trump: No.\par \par \uc2 Bash: John Kasich, would you care to drain the air from the room?\par \par \uc2 Kasich: I'm not doing it on purpose, Dana.\par \par \uc2 Bash: Ben Carson, how about you?\par \par \uc2 Ben Carson: I have given this a lot of thought and I think: cherries, mangoes, grapes, and grapefruit. Those little chunks of grapefruit that you're never expecting. That's Justice Thomas, to me.\par \par \uc2 Cruz: I am sharply to the right of Donald on Obamacare. I'd like to be clear about that. He says things like\u160\'00\'A0"I don't think people with pre-existing conditions should die in the street" -- well, I don't agree. We are different, he and I. I am not weak like him.\par \par \uc2 Trump: Just so we're clear, you are going on the record as in favor of people dying in the streets, Ebenezer Cruz.\par \par \uc2 Rubio: Ted, please, I already did a more appealing version of this attack. Stop helping.\par \par \uc2 Blitzer: Governor Kasich, would Donald's plan work?\par \par \uc2 Kasich: Well, it wouldn't work in Ohio! (crickets) Come on, that always goes over HUGE in Cleveland!\par \par \uc2 Blitzer:\u160\'00\'A0Mitt Romney says there's a bombshell in your taxes, Donald.\par \par \uc2 Trump: Hang on one second, let me push an old lady off the stage to almost certain death! (He does so.\u160\'00\'A0His poll numbers go up) You were saying?\par \par \uc2 Blitzer: Why haven't you released your returns?\par \par \uc2 Trump: Because I'm being audited.\par \par \uc2 Cruz: Wait, that's your actual answer, you can't release your returns because you're being audited?\par \par \uc2 Trump: Yuuuuup.\par \par \uc2 Rubio: I have to agree with Ted here. What?\par \par \uc2 Trump: Let me just say in response to Ted that I am winning in the polls. I will make America great again. We're going to win, win win.\par \par \uc2 Cruz: You're not beating Hillary.\par \par \uc2 Trump: "Well, then, if I can't -- if -- hey, if I can't beat her, you're really going to get killed, aren't you?"\par \par \uc2 Audience: OOOOOOOOOOOH\par \par \uc2 Trump: Ted, if you were a sandwich, you would be a single slice of ham by itself, because you could not get two slices of bread to stand beside\u160\'00\'A0you. Nobody likes you, Ted.\par \par \uc2 Cruz: I DRINK YOUR HATRED. IT MAKES ME STRONGER.\par \par \uc2 Trump: Does it, though?\par \par \uc2 Blitzer: How much does everyone on this stage\u160\'00\'A0love Israel?\par \par \uc2 Rubio: So much.\par \par \uc2 Cruz: I have endorsed Israel for President of the United States.\par \par \uc2 Trump: Look, real estate is real estate. Deals are deals.\u160\'00\'A0Israel\u160\'00\'A0is just some fancy real estate in a great location. Peace in the Middle East is just another deal, and I am in favor of peace in the Middle East. Many Miss Universe contestants have said that in my hearing and I\u160\'00\'A0think they made some good, complex points.\par \par \uc2 Blitzer: Governor Kasich, what would you do about Kim Jong Un? Remove him?\par \par \uc2 Kasich: Well, that would depend on what was happening. If things were happening where it seemed like the right move was to remove him, I'd remove him. If not, then, no, I don't think so. Shucks.\par \par \uc2 Trump: Also, is there a way to put Gadhafi back in charge in Libya? I liked him. Seemed like a guy who knew what he was doing. Unlike this crowd of\u160\'00\'A0losers. "I mean, first of all, this guy is a choke artist, and this guy is a liar."\par \par \uc2 Carson: Can somebody attack me, please?\par \par \uc2 Trump: No.\par \par \uc2 Cruz: (clears throat) Actually, "falsely accusing someone of lying is itself a lie\u8230\'20\'26"\par \par \uc2 Trump: Don't try to confuse us with your liar talk, liar. "I know politicians -- I know politicians, believe it or not, better than you do. And it's not good."\par \par \uc2 Cruz: I believe it. No, no. I believe you know politicians much better than I do, because for 40 years, you've been funding liberal Democratic politicians. And by the way\u8230\'20\'26"\par \par \uc2 Trump: I funded you. I funded him. Can you believe it?\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Rubio: He never funded ME.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Cruz: And -- and by the way, let's be clear.\u160\'00\'A0Donald claims -- Donald claims to care about\u8230\'20\'26\par \par \uc2 Trump: You know why? I didn't want to, but he sent me his book with his autograph\u8230\'20\'26\par \par \uc2 Cruz: Donald. Donald. Donald. I understand rules are very hard for you. They're very confusing.\par \par \uc2 Trump:\u160\'00\'A0Mr. Trump, you're doing a great job. I have his book.\u160\'00\'A0Thank you -- thank you for the book. Go ahead.\par \par \uc2 Cruz: Donald, you can get back on your meds now.\par \par \uc2 Trump: This is a lot of fun up here tonight, I have to tell you. \u160\'00\'A0Thank -- thank you for the book. I really appreciate.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Cruz: Donald -- Donald, relax.\par \par \uc2 Trump: Go ahead. I'm relaxed. You're the basket case.\u160\'00\'A0Go ahead.\u160\'00\'A0Don't get nervous.\u160\'00\'A0Go ahead.\par \par \uc2 Cruz: I promise you, Donald, there's nothing about you\u8230\'20\'26\par \par \uc2 Trump: I've seen you.\par \par \uc2 Cruz: \u8230\'20\'26 that makes anyone nervous. [Politifact rating: mostly false.]\par \par \uc2 Trump: You're losing so badly you -- I want to\u8230\'20\'26\par \par \uc2 Cruz: You know, people are actually watching this at home.\par \par \uc2 Rubio: Is there a guy who is supposed to be moderating this?\par \par \uc2 Blitzer: Hey now, guys.\par \par \uc2 Rubio: Wow, that's some moderation.\par \par \uc2 Blitzer: Hey now, guys. Hey. Can we -- can we not? In all honesty, I'm worried that if this debate goes any longer, I will be trampled underfoot.\u160\'00\'A0You want closing statements? Or not? Not is fine too, it's about what you want tonight.\par \par \uc2 Carson: Closing statements are fine. Look at my hands. "A movie was made about these hands." They\u160\'00\'A0are the right size to make a movie about, unlike some of the hands on these stage. Look at the fruit salad of my life, then make your decision. Peaches.\par \par \uc2 Kasich: I've been trying to stand apart from the fray tonight, or at least off to the side of the fray, hoping that no one will notice I am there and throw a dodgeball at me. It has worked and backfired simultaneously. Vote for me in Ohio, please!\par \par \uc2 Rubio: FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS HOLY, I AM YOUR ONLY CHANCE! I HAVE SEEN HOW THIS UNFOLDS AND IT IS A NIGHTMARE. PICTURE THE WORST THING YOU CAN PICTURE. NOW DOUBLE THAT. NOW DOUBLE IT AGAIN. THEN PUT A COCKROACH ON IT. THAT IS THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY. WE HAVE TO STOP HIM, DO YOU HEAR ME? THAT IS WHY I WAS SENT BACK HERE! BUT IT'S NOT WORKING. LOOK! ALREADY, I AM STARTING TO FADE! YOU CAN SEE THE PODIUM THROUGH MY TORSO! VOTE, VOTE NOW! IT IS OUR ONLY CHANCE, I TELL YOU!\par \par \uc2 Cruz: I am a true conservative who stands to the right of Trump on everything, if that helps. Does that help?\u160\'00\'A0And no one I have ever worked with likes me.\par \par \uc2 Rubio: (vanishing faster) STOP HELPING!\par \par \uc2 Trump: This was fun. We all had fun tonight, didn't we, guys? (stabs a baby panda to death. Everyone cheers.)\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020160226ec2q002xl\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved   \par \par \uc2 LAS VEGAS - The Trump International Hotel rises as a gaudy band of gold just off the Strip, for years just another showy bauble in a city full of them. But now that its billionaire owner has established his political primacy and forced Jeb Bush from the GOP presidential race, the "TRUMP" marquee that looms 600 feet above the valley floor seems to foreshadow another strong showing when the contest comes here Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  is real - that's the gut punch many Republicans are reeling from after his win in South Carolina this past weekend. True, he's been in the lead for months. His personality has dominated debates. He had won a huge victory in New Hampshire.\par \par \uc2 But with the departure of Bush, the former Florida governor, on Saturday, a safe harbor for many longtime GOP leaders and donors all but disappeared from the horizon. Nevada looms as the next notch on the belt, and even if Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) or \uc2 Marco Rubio\uc2  (R-Fla.) should pull out a narrow victory in the state's caucuses, there doesn't seem to be anything anyone can do to stop the Trump train.\par \par \uc2 "Trump will probably win" on Tuesday, Sig Rogich, a close friend of Bush and a dean of Republican politics here, said with a sigh born of a town built on Trump-style showmanship and pizzazz.\par \par \uc2 The best news? "Rubio might get second," he said, referring to the first-term senator seen by many establishment figures as the best alternative to Trump. If Trump wins the nomination? "A catastrophe for the party," Rogich said.\par \par \uc2 Pete Ernaut, another Bush backer, spent part of Sunday on the golf course, coming to terms with the pall that has fallen over the party establishment.\par \par \uc2 "Tough medicine to take," he said. "I was very sad to see that. . . . The epitaph for this cycle will be that a good and conventional candidate got swallowed up by the most unconventional campaign in presidential campaign history."\par \par \uc2 Ernaut is an executive at \uc2 R&R Partners\uc2 , a heavyweight public relations agency. The firm's chief executive is \uc2 Billy Vassiliadis\uc2 , a longtime Democratic adviser. He says he is sympathetic to Republicans. "They're pulling their hair out," he said. "The sadness over what happened to Jeb Bush is genuine."\par \par \uc2 The fallout of Bush's departure was swift, particularly in Nevada, which looms as a battleground state in the November general election. Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.), a Bush backer, switched his support on Sunday to Rubio. That was a particularly resonant gain for Rubio, who spent part of his childhood in Las Vegas.\par \par \uc2 Heller, calling Rubio "the next generation of conservative leadership in this country," said he had "become convinced that [Rubio is] the candidate capable of uniting conservatives, growing our party and beating the Democrats in November."\par \par \uc2 In Reno, on the far western side of the state, Adam Khan, chairman of the Washoe County GOP, said Bush's departure will probably kick supporters over to Rubio or Ohio Gov. John Kasich. That, he said, with potentially strong campaigns mounted by Rubio and Cruz, might mean that Trump could place as low as third.\par \par \uc2 "Or maybe that's just my wishful thinking," he said.\par \par \uc2 Trump arrived in the state overnight. He stayed at his own hotel, where the exterior windows are infused with 24-karat gold. He was scheduled to make a campaign appearances in Las Vegas on Monday night and in Sparks on Tuesday in advance of the afternoon caucus.\par \par \uc2 He has drawn huge crowds of blue-collar Republicans to previous rallies here, in a state of 2.8 million that was hit particularly hard by the recession. On local television, his campaign is airing an ad that tells the story of a young black man killed by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , with the victim's father standing with Trump. It's a blunt reminder of Trump's earlier statement about killers and rapists sneaking across the border and the hard-line stance on illegal immigration that has drawn support from many conservative voters.\par \par \uc2 That Trump's bombastic, occasionally profanity-laden form of campaigning has taken him into the lead, while Bush withdrew after just three states, has left traditional Republican donors and backers aghast. \uc2 Mel Sembler\uc2 , a board member of the super PAC Right to Rise, which backed Bush, told the \uc2 Tampa Bay Times\uc2  this week, "I don't understand our country any more."\par \par \uc2 Corey R. Lewandowski, Trump's campaign manager, isn't gloating about the demise of Bush, nor is he promising victory here. He predicted a close race in Nevada, citing as a particular concern the sometimes byzantine caucus method, still new to many Nevadans, that has kept turnout at around 10 percent the past two election cycles. "A lot of these candidates are gifted people, and they've been through this before," Lewandowski said. "\uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  has been a politician for all of about six months."\par \par \uc2 Rubio has been intent on winning the state for months, with a carefully constructed campaign and concerted outreach to the state's Mormon voters, who tend to turn out on election day. That's particularly important here because voters must be registered members of the party, find their local caucus site during a narrow time window and then wait to cast their ballot.\par \par \uc2 On Saturday, in the Democratic caucus, there were myriad problems with long lines, confusion and disorganized voting.\par \par \uc2 As elsewhere, Trump's rallies have drawn far larger, louder and more passionate crowds than his rivals, and he's taken an unorthodox local approach for victory. His statewide director, Charles Munoz, is a 26-year-old who has never run a campaign and recently told The Hill that he wasn't overly concerned about the caucus process, because it was "not rocket science." Munoz could not be reached for comment for this article.\par \par \uc2 The campaign's grass-roots energy will be the key, Lewandowski says. At the top of the campaign's home page is a "Nevada Caucus Finder" tab that allows voters to plug in their home address and be directed to the appropriate caucus site.\par \par \uc2 Khan, the GOP leader in Washoe County, said that the party's registration rules might prevent Trump from translating his big crowds and wide leads in surveys into a huge caucus victory.\par \par \uc2 "Polls in Nevada are bogus," Khan said.\par \par \uc2 At least, that's his hope.\par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com\par \par \uc2 WP20160223trumpisreal\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020160223ec2n0002y\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 LAS VEGAS \u8212\'20\'14 The Trump International Hotel rises as a gaudy band of gold just off the Strip, for years just another showy bauble in a city full of them. But now that its billionaire owner has established his political primacy and forced Jeb Bush from the GOP presidential race, the "TRUMP" marquee that looms 600 feet above the valley floor seems to foreshadow another strong showing when the contest comes here Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  is real \u8212\'20\'14 that's the gut punch many Republicans are reeling from after his win in South Carolina this past weekend. True, he's been in the lead for months. His personality has dominated debates. He had won a huge victory in New Hampshire.\par \par \uc2 But with the departure of Bush, the former Florida governor, on Saturday, a safe harbor for many longtime GOP leaders and donors all but disappeared from the horizon. Nevada looms as the next notch on the belt, and even if Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) or \uc2 Marco Rubio\uc2  (R-Fla.) should pull out a narrow victory in the state's caucuses, there doesn't seem to be anything anyone can do to stop the Trump train.\par \par \uc2 "Trump will probably win" on Tuesday, Sig Rogich, a close friend of Bush and a dean of Republican politics here, said with a sigh born of a town built on Trump-style showmanship and pizzazz.\par \par \uc2 The best news? "Rubio might get second," he said, referring to the first-term senator seen by many establishment figures as the best alternative to Trump. If Trump wins the nomination? "A catastrophe for the party," Rogich said.\par \par \uc2 Pete Ernaut, another Bush backer, spent part of Sunday on the golf course, coming to terms with the pall that has fallen over the party establishment.\par \par \uc2 "Tough medicine to take," he said. "I was very sad to see that. .\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09. The epitaph for this cycle will be that a good and conventional candidate got swallowed up by the most unconventional campaign in presidential campaign history."\par \par \uc2 Ernaut is an executive at \uc2 R&R Partners\uc2 , a heavyweight public relations agency. The firm's chief executive is \uc2 Billy Vassiliadis\uc2 , a longtime Democratic adviser. He says he is sympathetic to Republicans. "They're pulling their hair out," he said. "The sadness over what happened to Jeb Bush is genuine."\par \par \uc2 The fallout of Bush's departure was swift, particularly in Nevada, which looms as a battleground state in the November general election. Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.), a Bush backer, switched his support on Sunday to Rubio. That was a particularly resonant gain for Rubio, who spent part of his childhood in Las Vegas. Heller, calling Rubio "the next generation of conservative leadership in this country," said he had "become convinced that [Rubio is] the candidate capable of uniting conservatives, growing our party and beating the Democrats in November."\par \par \uc2 In Reno, on the far western side of the state, Adam Khan, chairman of the Washoe County GOP, said Bush's departure will probably kick supporters over to Rubio or Ohio Gov. John Kasich. That, he said, with potentially strong campaigns mounted by Rubio and Cruz, might mean that Trump could place as low as third.\par \par \uc2 "Or maybe that's just my wishful thinking," he said.\par \par \uc2 Trump arrived in the state overnight. He stayed at his own hotel, where the exterior windows are infused with 24-karat gold. He was scheduled to make a campaign appearances in Las Vegas on Monday night and in Sparks on Tuesday in advance of the afternoon caucus.\par \par \uc2 He has drawn huge crowds of blue-collar Republicans to previous rallies here, in a state of 2.8\u160\'00\'A0million that was hit particularly hard by the recession. On local television, his campaign is airing an ad that tells the story of a young black man killed by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , with the victim's father standing with Trump. It's a blunt reminder of Trump's earlier statement about killers and rapists sneaking across the border and the hard-line stance on illegal immigration that has drawn support from many conservative voters.\par \par \uc2 That Trump's bombastic, occasionally profanity-laden form of campaigning has taken him into the lead, while Bush withdrew after just three states, has left traditional Republican donors and backers aghast. \uc2 Mel Sembler\uc2 , a board member of the super PAC Right to Rise, which backed Bush, told the \uc2 Tampa Bay Times\uc2  this week, "I don't understand our country any more."\par \par \uc2 Corey R. Lewandowski, Trump's campaign manager, isn't gloating about the demise of Bush, nor is he promising victory here. He predicted a close race in Nevada, citing as a particular concern the sometimes byzantine caucus method, still new to many Nevadans, that has kept turnout at around 10\u160\'00\'A0percent the past two election cycles. "A lot of these candidates are gifted people, and they've been through this before," Lewandowski said. "\uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  has been a politician for all of about six months."\par \par \uc2 Rubio has been intent on winning the state for months, with a carefully constructed campaign and concerted outreach to the state's Mormon voters, who tend to turn out on election day. That's particularly important here because voters must be registered members of the party, find their local caucus site during a narrow time window and then wait to cast their ballot.\par \par \uc2 On Saturday, in the Democratic caucus, there were myriad problems with long lines, confusion and disorganized voting.\par \par \uc2 As elsewhere, Trump's rallies have drawn far larger, louder and more passionate crowds than his rivals, and he's taken an un\u173\'00\'ADor\u173\'00\'ADtho\u173\'00\'ADdox local approach for victory. His statewide director, Charles Munoz, is a 26-year-old who has never run a campaign and recently told The Hill that he wasn't overly concerned about the caucus process, because it was "not rocket science." Munoz could not be reached for comment for this article.\par \par \uc2 The campaign's grass-roots energy will be the key, Lewandow\u173\'00\'ADski says. At the top of the campaign's home page is a "Nevada Caucus Finder" tab that allows voters to plug in their home address and be directed to the appropriate caucus site.\par \par \uc2 Khan, the GOP leader in Washoe County, said that the party's registration rules might prevent Trump from translating his big crowds and wide leads in surveys into a huge caucus victory.\par \par \uc2 "Polls in Nevada are bogus," Khan said.\par \par \uc2 At least, that's his hope.\par \par \uc2 neely.tucker@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020160222ec2m006vd\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The ninth Republican presidential debate was in many ways the nastiest of the campaign, complete with raised voices, name calling, and criticism of family members Saturday night in South Carolina.\par \par \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  took sharp aim at former President George W. Bush's foreign policy and his brother, former Florida governor Jeb Bush, rebuked him sharply. Sen. Ted Cruz called \uc2 Sen. Marco Rubio\uc2  soft on immigration and Rubio accused Cruz of not telling the truth. Trump flatly called Cruz the "single biggest liar" on stage while Cruz told him not to interrupt.\par \par \uc2 The biggest news story heading into the debate was the death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. But after consensus support at the top of the debate for a conservative to succeed him, Scalia's death moved into the background as national security, immigration and the candidates' records dominated the discussion.\par \par \uc2 At one point, Cruz accused Trump of glossing over his liberal past on \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2  and abortion. Trump angrily fought back.\par \par \uc2 "Why do you lie?" Trump asked him.\par \par \uc2 The two started talking over each other at another point and Cruz said: "Adults learn not to interrupt." He also warned that with Trump, the country would get "liberal" nominees for the Supreme Court.\par \par \uc2 Trump blamed Cruz and George W. Bush -- who he bashed routinely during the debate -- for the nomination and support of Chief Justice John Roberts.\par \par \uc2 Earlier, Cruz and Rubio hit each other hard on immigration, with Cruz decrying the "Rubio-Schumer amnesty plan" and Rubio accusing Cruz of lying.\par \par \uc2 Cruz argued Rubio has been too soft on immigration and disparaged him for supporting a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants. Rubio struck back by arguing that Cruz once supported legalization.\par \par \uc2 Things got personal when Cruz pointed to an interview Rubio did on Spanish-language television as evidence he would not rescind executive actions taken by President Obama.\par \par \uc2 "I don't know how he knows what I said on \uc2 Univision\uc2  because he doesn't speak Spanish," Rubio shot back.\par \par \uc2 Minutes later, Jeb Bush and Trump clashed on immigration. Trump said Bush had the weakest immigration record of all the candidates.\par \par \uc2 Bush pivoted to other issues in his counterattack against Trump, saying it is "weak to disparage women. It's weak to disparage Hispanics."\par \par \uc2 Trump also hit former President George W. Bush hard, directing some blame at him for the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks and saying he erred badly by invading Iraq in 2003.\par \par \uc2 Trump clashed sharply on the issue with Jeb Bush, who came out swinging against Trump's foreign policy.\par \par \uc2 Bush accused Trump of dangerously advocating too cozy a relationship with Russian President \uc2 Vladimir Putin\uc2  in the Middle East. As Trump defended himself, he was booed by the crowd. He argued the people who were booing him were Bush's "special interests and lobbyists.\par \par \uc2 Trump later hit George W. Bush for making a "mistake" invading Iraq.\par \par \uc2 Jeb Bush counter-punched: "I could care less about the insults \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  gives to me. ... I am sick and tired of him going after my family."\par \par \uc2 "The World Trade Center came down during the reign of George Bush. He kept us safe?" Trump said. "I lost hundreds of friends" in the 9/11 terrorist attack.\par \par \uc2 Bush dismissed Trump's foreign policy knowledge: "This is from a guy who gets his foreign policy from the shows."\par \par \uc2 And in an exchange with Trump, Rubio blamed the Sept. 11 attacks on former President \uc2 Bill Clinton\uc2  . "The World Trade Center came down because \uc2 Bill Clinton\uc2  didn't kill Osama bin Laden when he had the chance to kill him," Rubio said.\par \par \uc2 Earlier, Trump said that if he were president now, he would try to nominate a successor for deceased Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, but he said it is incumbent on Republican Senate leaders to prevent the confirmation of President Obama's eventual nominee.\par \par \uc2 "I think it's up to Mitch McConnell and everyone else to stop it. It's called delay, delay, delay," he said.\par \par \uc2 Other candidates at the debate said that Obama should not nominate a new justice, praised Scalia's service on the court and urged a conservative replacement.\par \par \uc2 "\uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  will not have a consensus pick," said former Bush.\par \par \uc2 "I just wish we hadn't run so fast into politics," said Ohio Gov. John Kasich.\par \par \uc2 Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said: "The Senate needs to stand strong."\par \par \uc2 Scalia, who was beloved by conservatives, died hours before the debate began. His death and the subject of who will replace him immediately become major topics of conversation in the debate and in the broader campaign. After the candidates took the stage, debate moderator John Dickerson called for a moment of silence for Scalia.\par \par \uc2 Adding to the testy atmosphere Saturday, Trump issued a statement accusing the \uc2 Republican National Committee\uc2  of "illegally" putting out a fundraising notice using his name before withdrawing it "at my insistence." An \uc2 RNC\uc2  aide said the notice Trump was citing was related to a straw poll where participants were asked to donate once they picked a candidate.\par \par \uc2 "The straw poll allows supporters of all the candidates to help contribute to the presidential trust that ensures our nominee has the $23 million of \uc2 RNC\uc2  funds to take on \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  or Bernie Sanders," said RNC chief strategist and communications director \uc2 Sean Spicer\uc2  .\par \par \uc2 Saturday's debate was expected to test whether Rubio, who was ridiculed for mechanically repeating himself in the previous meeting, can regain his footing after a fifth-place finish in New Hampshire.\par \par \uc2 Several one-on-one competitions were expected to escalate on stage, because fewer candidates is likely to mean more talking time for each one. Among them: Trump vs. Cruz Rubio vs. Cruz, Rubio vs. Bush, and Bush vs. Kasich.\par \par \uc2 The two-hour clash, which \uc2 CBS News\uc2  is hosting, started at 9 p.m. Eastern time. This is the last debate before the Feb. 20 South Carolina primary.\par \par \uc2 Trump once again stood at the middle of the stage. He held a commanding lead in South Carolina, home to nearly 5\u160\'00\'A0million people, including an eclectic mix of Republicans. There are many Christian conservatives, defense hawks and centrists in the state.\par \par \uc2 Trump released an ad this week focusing on his signature issue: immigration. The father of an African American teenager killed by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  explains why he supports Trump in the ad.\par \par \uc2 "Trump is the only one saying: You're going to be dealt with. We're going to enforce that," Jamiel Shaw says in the ad. "We're going to enforce that. That's a beautiful thing."\par \par \uc2 Trump has voiced hard-line positions on immigration, including banning all Muslims from entering the country over concerns about terrorism and creating a "deportation force" to remove undocumented immigrants.\par \par \uc2 But in genteel South Carolina, Trump's challengers have taken aim at his brashness as much as they've targeted his policy ideas.\par \par \uc2 On the campaign trail this week, Rubio has criticized Trump for using crude language that he said he had to shield from his young sons. Right to Rise USA, a super PAC promoting Bush released an ad Friday calling Bush "the better man" and highlighting Trump's personal attacks.\par \par \uc2 Rubio is trying to reignite a campaign that fell apart in the final days before the New Hampshire vote. He is showing a personal side he hopes will wipe away accusations that he is too robotic. He also has adopted a more aggressive posture, hitting not just Trump but Bush, whom he argues does not have any foreign policy experience.\par \par \uc2 Bush, who finished just ahead of Rubio in New Hampshire, is trying to edge ahead of the senator in the battle for the mainstream Republican mantle. A strong showing in South Carolina, where Bush's father and brother won primaries, could deal a devastating blow to Rubio.\par \par \uc2 On Monday, former president George W. Bush plans to campaign with his brother at a rally in North Charleston, S.C., after mostly staying out of politics since he left the White House in 2009.\par \par \uc2 Rubio is not the only opponent Bush needs to worry about. Kasich, who finished a strong second in New Hampshire, has secured new financial support in recent days. He threatens to pull away some centrist Republicans also drawn to Bush.\par \par \uc2 Another battle that was raging heading into Saturday was the one between Trump and Cruz. Cruz's campaign released a video this week that says Trump "pretends to be a Republican." On Friday, Trump tweeted: "If @TedCruz doesn't clean up his act, stop cheating, & doing negative ads, I have standing to sue him for not being a natural born citizen."\par \par \uc2 Also on the stage is retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who has faded sharply after exploding onto the national political landscape last year. Carson is polling at the bottom of the field in South Carolina.\par \par \uc2 sean.sullivan@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 Jenna Johnson in Tampa, Philip Rucker in Greenville, Ed O'Keefe in Myrtle Beach, S.C., and Jose A. DelReal in Washington contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020160213ec2d004mp\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved   \par \par \uc2 TAMPA - \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 's latest campaign ad starts with a photo of an African American teenager in a football jersey, grinning for the camera and holding a football.\par \par \uc2 "Jas Shaw was a 17-year-old football star who was gunned down just outside his home," a narrator says as the words "gunned down" appear in white letters against a red background on top of the photo. "His killer? An \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  gang member who just got out of prison."\par \par \uc2 The 30-second ad, which will air in South Carolina ahead of the Feb. 20 Republican primary, features Jas Shaw's father, Jamiel Shaw, who has endorsed Trump for president and appeared on the campaign trail with him. In the ad, Shaw says Trump is the only candidate who will end illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 "Trump is the only one saying: 'You're going to be dealt with. We're going to enforce that,' " Shaw says in the ad. " 'We're going to enforce that.' That's a beautiful thing."\par \par \uc2 Trump launched his presidential campaign in June by describing many illegal immigrants from Mexico as violent criminals and rapists, a characterization that was quickly denounced by fellow Republicans and immigration activists as inaccurate and racist.\par \par \uc2 He doubled down on the statement and, to back up his assertion, searched for examples that he lists at campaign rallies: "Beautiful Kate," the 31-year-old woman who police say was gunned down on a San Francisco pier in July by a Mexican national who was in the country illegally after being deported five times. A California woman in her 60s who was raped, beaten and killed in August, allegedly by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who had been arrested six times in 15 months. And Jamiel Shaw Jr., known as Jas to his friends, the 17-year-old football star who was killed near his home in South Los Angeles in 2008.\par \par \uc2 Jas's father met Trump last summer as the billionaire faced accusations of racism for his comments in June. At a July 10 news conference with Trump at the Beverly Wilshire hotel in Beverly Hills, Calif., Shaw told reporters that political correctness has led Americans to ignore a rash of killings involving illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 "To me, he said it right," Shaw said, according to local media reports from last summer. "You don't have to know how to say everything, you just have to have action. . . . He's telling the truth."\par \par \uc2 The next day, Shaw appeared with Trump at a rally in Phoenix and again defended the candidate. Shaw spoke emotionally about how he was "one of those hands-on dads" who worked hard to raise "a good kid" who got high grades. When Jas was 5, Shaw started training him to be a football player. In high school, his son was in contact with recruiters at \uc2 Stanford University\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 On March 2, 2008, Shaw's son went to a mall with friends and talked with his father while walking home. A few minutes after they hung up, Shaw heard gunshots, "really loud, really crispy." He tried calling his son, but there was no answer. He ran outside and found his son's body in the street.\par \par \uc2 Later, police said two gang members mistook Shaw for a member of a rival gang because he was wearing a Spider-Man backpack.\par \par \uc2 In November 2012, Pedro Espinoza was sentenced to death for Jas's murder.\par \par \uc2 "After all that, you know, I found out that the guy that killed him was illegally in the country - come on," Shaw said at the Phoenix rally in July.\par \par \uc2 Shaw also accompanied Trump to a Las Vegas rally in December.

His son was fatally shot in 2008 by a gang member.\b0\par\par\uc2 By Jenna Johnson   \par \uc2 829 \uc2 words\par \uc2 13 February 2016\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 TAMPA\u160\'00\'A0\u8212\'20\'14 \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 's latest campaign\u160\'00\'A0ad starts with the photo of an African American teenager in a football jersey, grinning for the camera and holding a football.\par \par \uc2 "Jas Shaw was a 17-year-old football star who was gunned just outside his home," a narrator says as the words "gunned down" appear in white bold letters against a red background on top of the photo. "His killer? An \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  gang member who just got out of prison."\par \par \uc2 The 30-second ad, which will soon air in South Carolina ahead of the Feb. 20 Republican primary, features Jas\u160\'00\'A0Shaw's father, Jamiel Shaw, who has endorsed Trump for president and appeared on the campaign trail with him. In the ad, Shaw says Trump is the only candidate who will end illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 "Trump is the only one saying: 'You're going to be dealt with. We're going to enforce that,'\u160\'00\'A0" Shaw says in the ad. "We're going to enforce that. That's a beautiful thing."\par \par \uc2 Trump launched his presidential campaign in June by describing many illegal immigrants as violent criminals and rapists, a characterization that was quickly denounced by fellow Republicans and immigration activists as inaccurate and racist.\par \par \uc2 He\u160\'00\'A0doubled down on the statement and searched for examples to back up his assertion, which he lists off at campaign rallies: "Beautiful Kate," the 31-year-old woman who police say was gunned down on a San Francisco pier in July by a Mexican national in the country illegally and who had already been deported five times. A California woman in her 60s who was raped, beaten\u160\'00\'A0and killed in August allegedly by a man illegally in the country who had been\u160\'00\'A0arrested six times in 15 months. And Jamiel Shaw Jr., known as Jas to his friends, the 17-year-old football star who was\u160\'00\'A0killed near his home in South Los Angeles in 2008.\par \par \uc2 Jas's father met\u160\'00\'A0Trump\u160\'00\'A0last summer\u160\'00\'A0as the billionaire\u160\'00\'A0faced accusations of racism for his comments. At\u160\'00\'A0a July 10 news\u160\'00\'A0conference with Trump at the\u160\'00\'A0Beverly Wilshire hotel in Beverly Hills, Calif., Shaw told reporters that political correctness has led Americans to ignore the rash of murders involving illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Trump has also met with members of the\u160\'00\'A0Remembrance Project, a nonprofit group started in 2009 to "honor and remember Americans who have been killed by illegal aliens."\par \par \uc2 "To me, he said it right," Shaw said, according to local media reports from last summer. "You don't have to know how to say everything, you just have to have action. \u8230\'20\'26 He's telling the truth."\par \par \uc2 The next day, Shaw appeared with Trump at a rally in Phoenix\u160\'00\'A0and again defended the candidate. Shaw spoke emotionally about how he was "one of those hands-on dads" who worked hard to raise "a good kid" who got high grades, did the right thing and stayed out of trouble. When Jas was 5, Shaw started training his son to be a football player. In high school, his son was an early star and was in contact with\u160\'00\'A0recruiters at \uc2 Stanford University\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 On March 2, 2008, Shaw's son went to the mall with friends and talked with his dad as he was walking home. A few minutes after they hung up, Shaw heard gunshots, "really loud, really crispy." He tried calling his son but there was no answer. He ran outside and found his son's body in the street. Later police would say that two gang members mistook Shaw for a member of a rival gang because he was wearing a Spiderman backpack. In November 2012,\u160\'00\'A0Pedro Espinoza was sentenced to death for Shaw's murder.\par \par \uc2 "After all that, you know, I found out that\u160\'00\'A0the guy that killed him\u160\'00\'A0was illegally in the country \u8212\'20\'14 come on," Shaw said at the rally in Phoenix in July. "I thought that somebody black did it."\par \par \uc2 Shaw also accompanied Trump to a December rally in Las Vegas and is now featured in the ad released on Friday.\u160\'00\'A0A discussion about immigration is often accompanied by a discussion of race, and Shaw has become Trump's assistant in having that discussion \u8212\'20\'14 especially ahead of the primary in South Carolina, where more than 27 percent of the population is black. The ad doesn't mention the races of Jas Shaw or the man who killed him, but it shows their photos side by side.\par \par \uc2 "We don't know what's going on \u8212\'20\'14 that's why we need \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 ," Shaw said at the\u160\'00\'A0rally in Las Vegas. "He feels what we feel. I mean, he feels what we feel. He's just like us, you know? I know that now."\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020160213ec2d003jt\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Editorial-Opinion\par {\*\bkmkstart toc96}{\*\bkmkend toc96}\b \uc2 When will GOP rhetoric on immigration catch up to the truth?\b0\par\par\uc2 By Editorial Board   \par \uc2 547 \uc2 words\par \uc2 25 January 2016\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 THE ANTI-\uc2 ILLEGAL immigrant\uc2  rancor and outright nativism afoot in the Republican primary field give rise to the impression that illegal immigration has soared to unprecedented levels and that the border is no more than a line in the sand, scarcely monitored and easily crossed. The truth diverges wildly from that rhetoric, as a pair of recent studies demonstrate.\par \par \uc2 Notwithstanding the demagoguery of \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  and some of his GOP rivals, the number of illegal immigrants in this country, which has declined each year since 2008, is now at its lowest level since 2003, and the percentage of undocumented immigrants likewise is at its lowest point since the turn of the century.\par \par \uc2 A report from the \uc2 Pew Research Center\uc2  shows a decline of nearly a million unauthorized immigrants, to 11.3 million, from 2007 to 2014. An even more recent survey, from the Center for Migration Studies, a New York think tank, indicates that the number of illegal immigrants has now fallen to 10.9 million, a precipitous drop driven largely by declining arrivals from Mexico. In fact, according to Pew, for the first time since the 1940s, Mexican migrants have been leaving the United States at a greater rate than they have entered.\par \par \uc2 Those numbers underscore what demographers have known for several years: that the great wave of Mexican immigration that began in the mid-1960s crested a few years ago and has been tailing off. Some 11.7 million Mexican-born immigrants, roughly half of them undocumented, are now in this country, down from 12.8 million in 2007 . Most of those who have left have done so of their own accord; comparatively few were deported.\par \par \uc2 That Mr. Trump has leveraged fact-free rhetoric for political advantage is not news. Still, it is noteworthy that so much of the GOP-primary oxygen, at least until the terrorist attacks in Paris, was consumed by alarmist rhetoric about border security, when in fact the border is more tightly patrolled than ever, and apprehensions at the southwestern border, a rough measure of illegal crossings, have been cut by about two-thirds since Sept. 11, 2001.\par \par \uc2 The dwindling Mexican immigration since the Great Recession reflects a number of factors, including, on the "pull" side, balky economic recovery and tougher border enforcement in the United States and, on the "push" side, improving economic conditions and a falling birthrate in Mexico. The result, according to Pew, is that in the five years ending in 2014, more than 1 million Mexicans (including 100,000 children born in the United States with dual citizenship) returned from the United States to live in Mexico, while 870,000 Mexicans entered the United States, many or most of them illegally.\par \par \uc2 Republican rhetoric on immigration has not caught up to those numbers, nor to the reality that the U.S. economy, like other Western economies, cannot function without low-wage, low-skill labor, which Mexico has supplied. An estimate 7 million-plus undocumented immigrants, most of them Mexicans, are employed in this country. Mr. Trump's fantasies of mass deportation notwithstanding, they will not be replaced by native-born Americans. At some point, Republicans will need to grapple with that reality.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020160125ec1p000gw\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The 2016 presidential cycle seems to have gone on too long, and yet no votes have been cast. Everything up to that point -- the debates, the gaffes, the field, the coverage, etc. -- will get reset after we have real votes to look at. In the meantime, perhaps the conservative and mainstream media could stop:\par \par \uc2 1. Using the term "establishment." Many smart conservatives (more about that term later) understand this is a vapid expression that can mean anything to anyone. Instead of using it, force candidates who bat it around to define it. Is the "establishment" House Speaker \uc2 Paul Ryan\uc2  (R-wis.) or National Review of K Street lobbyists or anyone in Congress? Maybe all and maybe none of the above, but it has become worse than enlightening; it has become a smokescreen.\par \par \uc2 2. Allowing "amnesty" be used indiscriminately. The legal definition of amnesty is to absolve of blame without punishment. No one in the GOP presidential field is advocating that. If "amnesty" opponents want to refuse every \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  in any and all circumstances the ability to remain in the country, they should explain the fiscal, political and moral ramifications of their position. What does removing 11 million consumers, workers, sales and payroll taxpayers do to the economy and government revenue?\par \par \uc2 3. Using "conservatives" without qualification. "Conservatives" don't oppose Ryan, although a handful of members of the Freedom Caucus did. "Conservatives" do not oppose immigration reform; some anti-immigration reform voices are otherwise conservative. It's either lazy or an intentional effort to smear conservatives by referring to everyone who slaps a "conservative" sticker on his chest to be representative of varied movement in which there are people taking diametrically opposite positions.\par \par \uc2 4. Letting pols decry "deal-making" without explanation.\u160\'00\'A0When Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) denounces \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  because he would make deals with Democrats, one has to wonder if Cruz\u160\'00\'A0expects super-majorities of Republicans to exist permanently. Every president and Congress has made deals. The Founders made deals (the Great Compromise, for one). War requires the other side to capitulate or vanish; politics is about getting as much as you possibly can. The content of the deals is what matters. Without "deals" there are no laws, no budgets and no democratic government.\par \par \uc2 5. Declining to challenge pols when they say the "American people believe" or the "American people want." Make them define which cross section they are speaking about and what evidence they have to support their views. If a pol means "I believe" or "I want," don't let him or her hide behind voter opinion that may or may not exist.\par \par \uc2 6. \u160\'00\'A0Permitting Republicans to invoke Ronald Reagan for everything and anything. Unfortunately, unlike Marshall McLuhan, we cannot drag out Reagan to tell the pol he "knows nothing" of Reagan. In any event, the pol should explain why Reagan applies to the current situation.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020160122ec1m0073l\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

Of the nearly 350 people from the African nation who visited the United States and were expected to leave, roughly one in four was still here by the end of 2015.\par \par \uc2 The small Asian nation of Bhutan was next, followed by Burkina Faso, Laos and Eritrea. While the latter three sent over thousands of visitors, Djibouti and Bhutan each sent only several hundred.\par \par \uc2 As a share of overall visitors, Eritreans were more likely than those from any other country to leave in violation of the rules. Nearly 3 percent of the more than 2,300 Eritreans expected to leave the country last year did so, but only after violating the terms they agreed to when they arrived.\par \par \uc2 In fact, Africa was a major source of such violators. Behind Eritrea, the countries of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Chad were the next largest sources of visitors who disregarded the rules as they came and went.\par \par \uc2 The Marshall Islands ranked fifth, but that's because just two of its residents hadn't left the United States by the end of 2015.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020160122ec1m003bh\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 right-turn\par {\*\bkmkstart toc99}{\*\bkmkend toc99}\b \uc2 Chris Christie joins the deportation crowd \b0\par\par\uc2 By Jennifer Rubin   \par \uc2 583 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 January 2016\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, under attack for fudging his record of support for Supreme Court Justice \uc2 Sonia Sotomayor\uc2  and shifts in his stances on abortion and guns, is now racing to the\u160\'00\'A0right on immigration.\par \par \uc2 Christie took\u160\'00\'A0to the airwaves as a guest of anti-immigration talk show host Laura Ingraham, who said we could not rely on self-deportation but had to be prepared to deport the illegal immigrants who remained after the border was enforced, E-Verify was in place, etc.\u160\'00\'A0He said:\par \par \uc2 You're absolutely right, and that's why our campaign right from the beginning has said, we need a president who knows how to enforce the law and will enforce law, and that covers everything. That covers deportation, that covers E-Verify, and setting up a biometric system for visa holders so that we can track them and make sure that they're removed from the country if they try to overstay their visa. And these are all methods that we're using to enforce laws that already exist. Everyone wants to talk about new laws -- we don't need new laws, what we need is to enforce the ones that are there.\par \par \uc2 Really, has it come to this? He sure seemed to agree with his host's no-one-stays approach.\u160\'00\'A0His campaign, however, denies that he favors mass deportation, which leaves open the question of what he does with all those who do not self-deport.\par \par \uc2 On Monday he did tell\u160\'00\'A0Byron York, "You can't do what Trump is talking about, which is a mass deportation of 11 million people in two years. As both a practical matter and, I think, a matter of common sense, that's just not going to work." Then, however, he sounded like self-deportation was viable: "But I do think that E-Verify over time will encourage some people to leave on their own." So, that would be in favor of self-deportation?\par \par \uc2 If not mass deportation or self-deportation, what is he talking about? Well, apparently not comprehensive immigration reform, which is what he favored in 2010. Back then, he called for "common-sense" solutions for dealing with\u160\'00\'A0those here illegally.\u160\'00\'A0 If, like with the 5-year old orphans he is not willing to let in as Syrian refugees, no \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  ever gets naturalized\u160\'00\'A0under\u160\'00\'A0his scheme, then he puts himself in the same untenable spot in which\u160\'00\'A0Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) find themselves. Expelling 11 million people (whether en mass or over time) cannot be justified on economic, political or humanitarian grounds. We have people who have been here for decades with children and grandchildren who are citizens. They go too?\par \par \uc2 We've gotten to the point at which\u160\'00\'A0only \uc2 Sen. Marco Rubio\uc2  (R-Fla.) and Jeb Bush are being forthright on the issue. Rubio, while seeing the handwriting on the wall for one comprehensive bill, still favors beefing up border security, fixing legal immigration and then creating a pathway to citizenship. Bush is in agreement on the first two prongs but favors (after flirting with citizenship during the Gang of 8 fight) a legalization process. The quest to be the last governor standing, a straight shooter and grown-up, will become an uphill climb for Christie if he bobs and weaves\u160\'00\'A0on these issues. Sometimes it's better to tell the voters, including talk show hosts: I disagree with you.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020160121ec1l00810\par }\par \b \uc2 Search Summary\b0\par \par
