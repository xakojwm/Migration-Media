All Rights Reserved   \par \par \uc2 The \uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2  population in the United States has fallen below 11 million, according to a study released Wednesday, continuing a nearly decade-long decline that has the potential to reshape the debate over reforming the nation's immigration system.\par \par \uc2 The total undocumented immigrant population of 10.9 million is the lowest since 2003, says the report from the Center for Migration Studies, a New York think tank. The number of undocumented immigrants has fallen each year since 2008, the report says, driven primarily by a steady decline in illegal migrants from Mexico.\par \par \uc2 Sharper declines from South America and Europe have contributed to the overall numbers, the report says, even as illegal immigration from Central America - where families with children have flocked across the southwest border in recent months - is on the rise.\par \par \uc2 With its release as voting nears in the 2016 presidential primaries, the document could have an effect on the fiery debate over immigration on the campaign trail. Republican candidates, led by \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 , have portrayed the border as overwhelmed by illegal immigrants, and Trump says they must be kept out by a massive wall the New York developer proposes to build. President Obama and Democratic candidates say the border has never been more secure and call for comprehensive immigration reform to naturalize immigrants already here.\par \par \uc2 While the report - written by Robert Warren, a former longtime \uc2 U.S. government\uc2  demographer - is an estimate based on 2014 U.S. Census data and does not take a position on immigration, officials from the Center for Migration Studies took issue with Republican candidates' characterizations of the issue.\par \par \uc2 "The facts of the report tell a different story than what you might hear on the campaign trail or in the halls of Congress, where many send a message that we're being overrun by undocumented immigrants," Kevin Appleby, the center's senior director of international migration policy, said on a media call after the report's release. "The facts and the data show that's just not true. Hopefully, political discourse will be more fact-based going forward."\par \par \uc2 The debate over how to handle illegal migrants already in the United States has escalated even more in recent weeks. The Obama administration has launched a series of raids aimed at deporting the mostly women and children who have come from Honduras, Guatemala and other Central American countries since 2014. Administration officials are now working to quell political outrage the raids have triggered among immigration rights advocates and Latino leaders.\par \par \uc2 In some ways, the new report echoes other research showing that the political debate may have already been overtaken by changing immigration patterns. Demographers at \uc2 Pew Research Center\uc2 , for example, found last year that the number of illegal immigrants, which more than tripled to 12.2 million between 1990 and 2007, had since dropped by about 1 million. Pew's preliminary estimate counted the total \uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2  population at 11.3 million as of 2014.\par \par \uc2 The Center for Migration Studies report is the first in recent years to peg the number as falling below 11 million, giving it at least a symbolic significance, since the 11 million figure has been widely used by politicians and journalists.\par \par \uc2 Although the report does not cite specific reasons for the decline, other experts have attributed it to a combination of tighter U.S. border security and economic and demographic changes in Mexico, such as women having fewer children. The altered dynamics have changed the makeup of the undocumented population. Until recent years, illegal immigrants tended to be young men streaming across the southern border in pursuit of work. But demographic data shows that the typical \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  now is much more likely someone who is 35 or older and has lived in the United States for a decade or more.\par \par \uc2 The report reveals a series of other nuggets about an undocumented immigrant population that researchers have struggled to understand, since some still live in the proverbial shadows. The decline in illegal immigrants was driven primarily by a 9 percent drop in those arriving from Mexico since 2010, it said, though 6 million of the 10.9 million total are still originally from Mexico. During the same period, illegal immigrants arriving from South America fell 22 percent and those coming from Europe declined 18 percent.\par \par \uc2 At the same time, however, the undocumented population from Central America - where the surge of families and unaccompanied minors since 2014 has originated - went up 5 percent, the report said.\par \par \uc2 Only Texas and Virginia, of the 10 states with the highest undocumented populations, gained undocumented residents from 2010 to 2014, the report said. In all others the undocumented populations decline, including California, which the report said leads the nation with 2.6 million people living in the state illegally.\par \par \uc2 Demographers at the Center for Migration Studies also found that state laws designed to restrict the numbers of undocumented immigrants, such as the well-known one passed in Arizona, "did not have a lasting impact" on the size of the undocumented population.\par \par \uc2 The report's release came as the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2 , which enforces immigration laws, reported that more than 525,000 people overstayed their visas in fiscal 2014 and that about 482,000 of them are suspected to be in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 But the DHS report examined nearly 45 million non-immigrant visas, meaning that 98.8 percent of the visa-holders left the country on time, the department said in a statement. Center for Migration Studies officials said they did not believe the overstay numbers would affect their overall estimates of how many people are in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 Warren, the report's author, who worked as a government demographer for more than 30 years, said the low overstay rate was similar to what it was as far back as the 1980s and apparently has not increased over time. He added that the 525,000 people who stayed beyond their visas last year would probably be counteracted by "a lot of people who came in previous years, overstayed their visas and would have left last year."\par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com\par \par \uc2 WP20160121immigration0121\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020160121ec1l0003s\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  population in the United States has fallen below 11 million, continuing a nearly decade-long decline that has the potential to reshape the debate over reforming the nation's immigration system,\u160\'00\'A0according to a study released Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 The total undocumented immigrant population of 10.9 million is the lowest since 2003, says the report from the Center for Migration Studies, a New York think tank. The number of undocumented immigrants has fallen each year since 2008, the report says, driven primarily by a steady decline in illegal migrants from Mexico. Sharper declines from South America and Europe have contributed to the overall numbers, the report says, even as illegal immigration from Central America \u8212\'20\'14 where families with children have flocked across the southwest border in recent months \u8212\'20\'14 is on the rise.\par \par \uc2 With its release as voting nears in the 2016 presidential primaries,\u160\'00\'A0the 15-page document could impact the fiery debate over immigration unfolding on the campaign trail.\u160\'00\'A0Republican candidates, led by \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 , have portrayed the border as overwhelmed by illegal immigrants who must be kept out by a massive wall the New York developer proposes to build. President Obama and Democratic candidates say the border has never been more secure and call for comprehensive immigration reform to naturalize immigrants already here.\par \par \uc2 While the report -- written by\u160\'00\'A0Robert Warren, a former longtime \uc2 U.S. government\uc2  demographer -- is an estimate based on 2014 U.S. census data and doesn't take a position on immigration, officials from the center took issue with the characterizations of Republican candidates. "The facts of the report tell a different story than what you might hear on the campaign trail or in the halls of Congress, where many send a message that we're being overrun by undocumented immigrants," Kevin Appleby, the center's senior director of international migration policy, said on a press call after the report's release. "The facts and the data show that's just not true. Hopefully, political discourse will be more fact-based going forward."\par \par \uc2 The debate over how to handle illegal migrants already here has escalated even more in recent weeks. The Obama administration has launched a series of raids aimed at deporting the mostly women and children who have come from Honduras, Guatemala and other Central American countries since 2014. Administration officials are now\u160\'00\'A0working frantically to quell political outrage the raids have triggered among immigration rights advocates and Latino leaders.\par \par \uc2 In some ways, the new report echoes other research showing that the political debate may have already been overtaken by changing immigration patterns around the nation. Demographers at \uc2 Pew Research Center\uc2 , for example, found last year that the number of illegal immigrants --\u160\'00\'A0which more than tripled, to 12.2\u160\'00\'A0million, between 1990 and 2007 -- had since dropped by about 1\u160\'00\'A0million. Pew's preliminary estimate counted the total\u160\'00\'A0illegal immigration population at 11.3 million, as of 2014.\par \par \uc2 The new Center for Migration Studies report is the first in recent years to peg the number as falling below 11 million, giving it at least a symbolic significance, since the 11 million number has been widely used by politicians and journalists.\par \par \uc2 Although the new report does not cite specific reasons for the decline, other experts have attributed it to a combination of tighter U.S. border security measures and economic and demographic changes in Mexico, such as women having fewer children. The altered dynamics have changed the makeup of\u160\'00\'A0the undocumented population. Until recent years, illegal immigrants tended to be young men streaming across the Southern border in pursuit of work. But demographic data show that the typical \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  now is much more likely someone who is 35 or older and has lived in the United States for a decade or more.\par \par \uc2 The report reveals a series of other nuggets about an undocumented immigrant population that researchers have struggled to understand, since some still live in the proverbial shadows. The decline in illegal immigrants was driven primarily by nine percent drop in those arriving from Mexico since 2010, it said, though six million of the 10.9 million total are still originally from Mexico. During the same period, illegal immigrants arriving from South America fell 22 percent and those coming from Europe declined 18 percent.\par \par \uc2 At the same time, however, the undocumented population from Central America -- where the surge of families and unaccompanied minors since 2014 has originated -- went up five percent, the report said.\par \par \uc2 Only Texas and Virginia, of the 10 states with the highest undocumented populations, gained undocumented residents from 2010 to 2014, the report said. All others saw their undocumented populations decline, including California, which the report said leads the nation with 2.6 million people here illegally.\par \par \uc2 Demographers at the center also found that state laws designed to restrict the numbers of undocumented immigrants, such as the well known one passed in Arizona, "did not have a lasting impact" on the size of the undocumented population.\par \par \uc2 The report's release came as the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2 , which enforces immigration laws, reported that more than 525,000 people overstayed their visas in fiscal year 2014 and that about 482,000 of them are suspected to be in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 But the DHS report examined nearly 45 million non-immigrant visas, meaning that 98.8 percent of the visa-holders left the country on time, the department said in a statement. Center for Migration Studies officials said they did not believe the overstay numbers would affect their overall estimates of how many people are in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 Warren, the report's author, who worked as a government demographer for more than 30 years, said the very low overstay rate was similar to what it was as far back as the 1980s and apparently has not increased over time. He added that the 525,000 people who stayed beyond their visas last year would likely be counteracted by "a lot of people who came in previous years, overstayed their visas and would have left last year."\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020160120ec1k0073l\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  population in the United States has fallen below 11 million, continuing a nearly decade-long decline that has the potential to reshape the debate over reforming the nation's immigration system,\u160\'00\'A0according to a study released Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 The total undocumented immigrant population of 10.9 million is the lowest since 2003, says the report from the Center for Migration Studies, a New York think tank. The number of undocumented immigrants has fallen each year since 2008, the report says, driven primarily by a steady decline in illegal migrants from Mexico. Even sharper declines from South America and Europe have contributed to the overall numbers, the report says, even as illegal immigration from Central America \u8212\'20\'14 where families with children have flocked across the southwest border in recent months \u8212\'20\'14 is on the rise.\par \par \uc2 Written by Robert Warren, a former longtime \uc2 U.S. government\uc2  demographer, the document could have an impact on the fiery debate over immigration that has unfolded on the 2016 presidential campaign trail. Republican candidates, led by \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 , have portrayed the border as overwhelmed by illegal immigrants who must be kept out by a massive wall the New York developer proposes to build. President Obama and Democratic candidates say the border has never been more secure and call for comprehensive immigration reform to naturalize immigrants already here.\par \par \uc2 While it doesn't take a political position or name a party, the paper uses 2014 Census Bureau data to essentially argue that the Republican portrayal is inaccurate. "One reason for the high and sustained level of interest\u160\'00\'A0in undocumented immigration is the widespread belief that the trend in\u160\'00\'A0the undocumented population is ever upward," the 15-page report says. \u160\'00\'A0"This paper shows that this\u160\'00\'A0belief is mistaken and that, in fact, the undocumented population has been\u160\'00\'A0decreasing for more than a half a decade."\par \par \uc2 The debate over how to handle illegal migrants already here has escalated even more in recent weeks. The Obama administration has launched a series of raids aimed at deporting the mostly women and children who have come from Honduras, Guatemala and other Central American countries since 2014. Administration officials are now\u160\'00\'A0working frantically to quell political outrage the raids have triggered among immigration rights advocates and Latino leaders.\par \par \uc2 The new report echoes other research showing that the nation's illegal immigration flows have fallen to their lowest level in at least two decades. Demographers at \uc2 Pew Research Center\uc2 , for example, found last year that the number of illegal immigrants --\u160\'00\'A0which more than tripled, to 12.2\u160\'00\'A0million, between 1990 and 2007 -- had since dropped by about 1\u160\'00\'A0million. Pew's preliminary estimate counted the total\u160\'00\'A0illegal immigration population at 11.3 million, as of 2014. The new Center for Migration Studies report is the first in recent years to peg the number as falling below 11 million.\par \par \uc2 Although the new report does not cite specific reasons for the decline, other experts have attributed it to a combination of tighter U.S. border security measures and economic and demographic changes in Mexico, such as women having fewer children.\par \par \uc2 A key \u8212\'20\'14 but largely overlooked \u8212\'20\'14 sign of these ebbing flows is the changing makeup of the undocumented population. Until recent years, illegal immigrants tended to be young men streaming across the Southern border in pursuit of work. But demographic data show that the typical \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  now is much more likely someone who is 35 or older and has lived in the United States for a decade or more.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020160120ec1k004jy\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved   \par \par \uc2 The Peace Corps has suspended its half-century-old program in El Salvador, highlighting the violence that has racked the Central American nation and helped propel a wave of migration to the United States.\par \par \uc2 In a statement, the agency - begun by President John F. Kennedy - said it is withdrawing its 55 volunteers, who work on youth development and community economic development projects, "due to the ongoing security environment." El Salvador has suffered a rash of gang- and drug-related violence, although Peace Corps officials said no specific security incidents or threats triggered the suspension.\par \par \uc2 The gang wars helped fuel a renewed surge in recent months of families with children flocking illegally across the border in the U.S. Southwest, the vast majority from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. That, in turn, triggered a series of New Year's weekend raids in which federal agents took into custody 121 \uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2  adults and children and deported 77 of them.\par \par \uc2 Some advocates for immigrants expressed concern Thursday that the Obama administration has shown itself willing to deport people back to the violence-plagued nation while pulling out its own Peace Corps volunteers because of that very violence. "It's very problematic," said \uc2 Guillermo Cantor\uc2 , deputy research director for the American Immigration Council, a Washington-based advocacy group. "Even though there is an acknowledgment by our government that the situation in Central America is so serious that U.S. citizens should not be going there under these programs, it's okay to send people who are fleeing those conditions back to those countries, and who knows what's going to happen to them?"\par \par \uc2 U.S. officials dismissed any comparison between the Peace Corps' move and the immigration raids. Officials said the administration remains concerned about the violence in Central America. They pointed to a series of steps the government has taken in response, including obtaining $750 million in the new federal budget to fight poverty and gang violence in the region, as well as this week's expansion of the U.S. refugee resettlement program. Vice President Biden and Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson were in Guatemala on Thursday, partly for talks on security and other issues.\par \par \uc2 "We recognize the serious underlying conditions that cause some people to flee their home countries," said Peter Boogaard, a White House spokesman. He said the administration is trying "to provide a safe and legal alternative to the dangerous journey" many people are undertaking north from Central America. At the same time, he indicated that the White House is not backing away from the immigration enforcement actions, which have triggered an uproar among advocates and many Democrats.\par \par \uc2 "We cannot allow our borders to be open to illegal migration," Boogaard said. "Those who come here illegally will be sent home after being provided an opportunity to have their cases heard, consistent with our laws and values."\par \par \uc2 Of the 77 people deported thus far, none were sent to El Salvador, \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2  officials said Thursday. The majority, 37, were deported to Mexico, while 26 were sent to Honduras and 14 to Guatemala.\par \par \uc2 El Salvador's death toll recently surged to the highest levels since the country's civil war ended in 1992. The increase came after a truce between the country's two most powerful street gangs - Mara Salvatrucha and the 18th Street gang - crumbled in 2014. The 2015 homicide rate of about 104 per 100,000 people, an increase of about 70 percent from 2013, is estimated to be among the highest in the world for countries not at war.\par \par \uc2 The violence led the State Department to issue a travel warning in June urging U.S. citizens going to El Salvador to be extra careful because "crime and violence levels . . . remain high." Since 2010, the alert said, 34 U.S. citizens have been slain there, including a 9-year-old in December 2013.\par \par \uc2 The Peace Corps, which began its El Salvador program in 1962 and has sent more than 2,300 volunteers to the country, reevaluated its involvement because of a recent security assessment, the agency said. "There is no evidence that Americans or American interests are being targeted in El Salvador, and the rate of crimes against Peace Corps Volunteers in El Salvador is among the lowest in the region," according to a Peace Corps statement. "However, this decision is based on the safety and security environment in the country as a whole."\par \par \uc2 The agency, the statement said, "will continue to monitor the security environment and reassess the security situation at an appropriate future date to determine when Volunteers can return."\par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com\par \par \uc2 WP20160115federaleye0115\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020160115ec1f0001j\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved   \par \par \uc2 It is quiet now, a little too quiet, along the suburban avenues lined with Salvadoran pupusa shops and Guatemalan bakeries. The stores are emptier than usual, and some of the waitresses and clerks are not showing up at work. Everyone seems to know about last weekend's raids, when immigration agents pounded on doors before dawn and took mothers and children away\par \par \uc2 The deportations have brought the divisive issue of illegal immigration once again to the political forefront. The raids were the first large-scale effort to deport families who had fled violence and poverty in Central America in 2014 and 2015. More than 100,000 families with adults and children crossed the southwestern border.\par \par \uc2 Despite an uproar from liberal Democrats and Latino advocacy groups, administration officials said Friday that they intend to continue the raids, hoping to send a signal and prevent a repeat of the huge surge in illegal border crossings. Although the numbers dipped last spring, a new spike saw more than 10,000 children reach the border in October and November alone.\par \par \uc2 "The enforcement strategy and priorities that the administration has articulated are not going to change," White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Friday. "Individuals who recently crossed the border are priorities for removal."\par \par \uc2 Earnest noted that after immigration reform efforts failed in Congress, Obama acted on his own to shield from deportation 700,000 young illegal immigrants who had been here for years. "You have a president of the United States who has worked hard to use his own executive authority to try to make the process more fair," he said.\par \par \uc2 Some Democratic leaders, including House Whip Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.), have expressed concern about the raids, and Rep. Luis V. Gutierrez (D-Ill.) and other members of the \uc2 Congressional Hispanic Caucus\uc2  are calling on Obama to offer affected families temporary legal protection.\par \par \uc2 "We have a refugee crisis, not an immigration problem," Gutierrez said at a rally outside the White House on Friday. Alluding to the epidemic of drugs and gang violence that experts say is fueling the exodus from Central America, Gutierrez said, "We, too, are responsible."\par \par \uc2 In all, 121 mothers and children were detained in three states last weekend and sent to federal detention facilities, U.S. officials say. Federal officials said the families targeted for deportation had been processed by immigration courts.\par \par \uc2 The raids sowed fear and confusion in communities including Atlanta, Houston, Los Angeles and the greater Washington region, home to tens of thousands of Central Americans. At a time when some Republican presidential hopefuls talk of ridding the country of all of its 11 million illegal immigrants, the crackdown by a Democratic administration has many wondering if they, too, will be targeted.\par \par \uc2 "People are very confused," said Adelina Nicholls, executive director of the Georgia Latino Alliance for Human Rights. "They hear there are raids going on, but they don't know why, and they worry they will be affected, too."\par \par \uc2 Agents in the bushes\par \par \uc2 Rene Morales was jolted awake just after 4 a.m. last Saturday in the leafy Atlanta suburb of Stone Mountain. His doorbell was buzzing, and someone was pounding on the door. He peered out the window to see a dozen armed federal agents standing among rose bushes and Christmas lights.\par \par \uc2 They had come for his sister Rosa Vargas and her children, who fled their native Guatemala and walked across the Texas border in July 2014. Morales said Vargas, 36, decided to head north after she witnessed a murder and was threatened by gang members.\par \par \uc2 "The whole family agreed she would be better off leaving, that she should come here because she would be safe in America," said Morales, 30, a carpenter with temporary legal status. He said Vargas was issued a work permit and a Social Security number when she was released from border detention in 2014 and found work cleaning houses in Atlanta after coming to live with him.\par \par \uc2 The agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement "made me wait outside while they went upstairs," Morales said. "They said they had an order from a judge. They didn't hurt anyone, but they shouted a lot."\par \par \uc2 After allowing the family to dress and gather a few belongings, the agents put Vargas, 17-year-old Juan and 11-year-old Dankilia into vans and drove off, Morales said. Vargas's older daughter was allowed to stay behind with her year-old son, who was born in the United States.\par \par \uc2 By Monday, the others were in a detention center in Texas awaiting deportation, while a lawyer tried to file an emergency appeal.\par \par \uc2 "Together we were a family, and we made this house a home," Morales said. "Now there is nothing."\par \par \uc2 The raids in the greater Atlanta area were quick, quiet and isolated, advocates said, targeting perhaps a dozen individual homes and apartments across a large metropolitan region. In each case, ICE officials said, the families had been processed by immigration courts, where they had either been denied special relief from deportation or had not applied for it.\par \par \uc2 Since the raids, advocacy groups here and elsewhere have set up hotlines, held emergency neighborhood meetings and put out website alerts telling people they have the right not to open their doors to ICE agents or provide them with information. Legal aid groups have been deluged with calls from frantic immigrants who think agents are headed their way.\par \par \uc2 "Of course we are all worried," said Francisco Perez, a bakery owner from Guatemala who has been here for 12 years. "One hears that now they are separating families, parents from children, even people with work permits. One feels so defenseless."\par \par \uc2 Searching for safety\par \par \uc2 Atlanta's Latino population has a well-established economic niche but a tense relationship with police and government authorities, advocates say. There have been long-running battles over legal issues such as what immigration status one needs to obtain a driver's license.\par \par \uc2 Georgia is one of several states that have passed tough laws limiting the rights of noncitizens, and numerous police departments here have formal agreements to inform ICE when an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  is arrested.\par \par \uc2 Most illegal immigrants in the state are Mexicans who migrated here to pick crops or work in poultry plants and factories. But a growing minority have arrived from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, driven in part by soaring rates of murder and gang violence back home.\par \par \uc2 Many Central American children and mothers who arrived in the recent border surge have told officials they were trying to escape violence; some have applied for political asylum or other forms of deportation relief. Those cases have been working their way through immigration courts, but legal aid lawyers say few have been finalized.\par \par \uc2 "The Obama administration is putting families and children on the same level as criminals and terrorists," said \uc2 Wendy Young\uc2 , executive director of Kids in Need of Defense, a Washington-based legal aid agency. "Even if these families do have final deportation orders and their window for appeal has expired, do we know if they had fair hearings, or had access to counsel, or understood the process?"\par \par \uc2 In one of the raids conducted last weekend, agents took a woman who had been in their custody for a month back to her house outside Atlanta to pick up her two young sons so that all three could be sent to a deportation center in Texas.\par \par \uc2 Dominga Rivas, 27, a restaurant cook from El Salvador, had been stopped by police for making a wrong turn. She was reported to ICE as an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  and handed over to federal agents. When she arrived home early Saturday, her sons, ages 4 and 7, were still sleeping, relatives said.\par \par \uc2 "The boys were frightened, and Dominga was crying," said her sister, Doris Rivas, 33, a hairdresser who has temporary legal status. "They sent a woman agent to the bedroom and gave them five minutes to get dressed and put their things in a plastic bag. It was such an ugly thing to see."\par \par \uc2 Rivas said her sister fled El Salvador in 2014 because her abusive ex-husband had become involved with gangs and threatened to kill her. She applied for asylum after reaching the United States but was turned down.\par \par \uc2 "If she goes back, her life will be in danger, and so will the boys', because soon the gangs will start pressuring them to join or be killed," Rivas said. "Nobody can survive in my country now."\par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com\par \par \uc2 WP20160110atlantaraids0108\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020160110ec1a00032\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved   \par \par \uc2 ATLANTA -It is quiet now, a little too quiet, along the suburban avenues lined with Salvadoran pupusa shops and Guatemalan bakeries. The stores are emptier than usual, and some of the waitresses and clerks are not showing up at work. Everyone seems to know about last weekend's raids, when immigration agents pounded on doors before dawn and took mothers and children away.\par \par \uc2 The deportations have brought the divisive issue of illegal immigration once again to the political forefront. The raids were the first large-scale effort to deport families who had fled violence and poverty in Central America in 2014 and 2015. More than 100,000 families with adults and children crossed the southwestern border.\par \par \uc2 Despite an uproar from liberal Democrats and Latino advocacy groups, administration officials said Friday that they intend to continue the raids, hoping to send a signal and prevent a repeat of the huge surge in illegal border crossings. Although the numbers dipped last spring, a new spike saw more than 10,000 children reach the border in October and November alone.\par \par \uc2 "The enforcement strategy and priorities that the administration has articulated are not going to change," White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Friday. "Individuals who recently crossed the border are priorities for removal."\par \par \uc2 Earnest noted that after immigration reform efforts failed in Congress, Obama acted on his own to shield from deportation 700,000 young illegal immigrants who had been here for years. "You have a president of the United States who has worked hard to use his own executive authority to try to make the process more fair," he said.\par \par \uc2 Some Democratic leaders, including House Whip Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.), have expressed concern about the raids, and Rep. Luis V. Gutierrez (D-Ill.) and other members of the \uc2 Congressional Hispanic Caucus\uc2  are calling on Obama to offer affected families temporary legal protection.\par \par \uc2 "We have a refugee crisis, not an immigration problem," Gutierrez said at a rally outside the White House on Friday. Alluding to the epidemic of drugs and gang violence that experts say is fueling the exodus from Central America, Gutierrez said, "We, too, are responsible."\par \par \uc2 In all, 121 mothers and children were detained in three states last weekend and sent to federal detention facilities, U.S. officials say. Federal officials said the families targeted for deportation had been processed by immigration courts.\par \par \uc2 The raids sowed fear and confusion in communities including Atlanta, Houston, Los Angeles and the greater Washington region, home to tens of thousands of Central Americans. At a time when some Republican presidential hopefuls talk of ridding the country of all of its 11 million illegal immigrants, the crackdown by a Democratic administration has many wondering if they, too, will be targeted.\par \par \uc2 "People are very confused," said Adelina Nicholls, executive director of the Georgia Latino Alliance for Human Rights. "They hear there are raids going on, but they don't know why, and they worry they will be affected, too."\par \par \uc2 Agents in the bushes\par \par \uc2 Rene Morales was jolted awake just after 4 a.m. last Saturday in the leafy Atlanta suburb of Stone Mountain. His doorbell was buzzing, and someone was pounding on the door. He peered out the window to see a dozen armed federal agents standing among rose bushes and Christmas lights.\par \par \uc2 They had come for his sister Rosa Vargas and her children, who fled their native Guatemala and walked across the Texas border in July 2014. Morales said Vargas, 36, decided to head north after she witnessed a murder and was threatened by gang members.\par \par \uc2 "The whole family agreed she would be better off leaving, that she should come here because she would be safe in America," said Morales, 30, a carpenter with temporary legal status. He said Vargas was issued a work permit and a Social Security number when she was released from border detention in 2014 and found work cleaning houses in Atlanta after coming to live with him.\par \par \uc2 The agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement "made me wait outside while they went upstairs," Morales said. "They said they had an order from a judge. They didn't hurt anyone, but they shouted a lot."\par \par \uc2 After allowing the family to dress and gather a few belongings, the agents put Vargas, 17-year-old Juan and 11-year-old Dankilia into vans and drove off, Morales said. Vargas's older daughter was allowed to stay behind with her year-old son, who was born in the United States.\par \par \uc2 By Monday, the others were in a detention center in Texas awaiting deportation, while a lawyer tried to file an emergency appeal.\par \par \uc2 "Together we were a family, and we made this house a home," Morales said. "Now there is nothing."\par \par \uc2 The raids in the greater Atlanta area were quick, quiet and isolated, advocates said, targeting perhaps a dozen individual homes and apartments across a large metropolitan region. In each case, ICE officials said, the families had been processed by immigration courts, where they had either been denied special relief from deportation or had not applied for it.\par \par \uc2 Since the raids, advocacy groups here and elsewhere have set up hotlines, held emergency neighborhood meetings and put out website alerts telling people they have the right not to open their doors to ICE agents or provide them with information. Legal aid groups have been deluged with calls from frantic immigrants who think agents are headed their way.\par \par \uc2 "Of course we are all worried," said Francisco Perez, a bakery owner from Guatemala who has been here for 12 years. "One hears that now they are separating families, parents from children, even people with work permits. One feels so defenseless."\par \par \uc2 Searching for safety\par \par \uc2 Atlanta's Latino population has a well-established economic niche but a tense relationship with police and government authorities, advocates say. There have been long-running battles over legal issues such as what immigration status one needs to obtain a driver's license.\par \par \uc2 Georgia is one of several states that have passed tough laws limiting the rights of noncitizens, and numerous police departments here have formal agreements to inform ICE when an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  is arrested.\par \par \uc2 Most illegal immigrants in the state are Mexicans who migrated here to pick crops or work in poultry plants and factories. But a growing minority have arrived from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, driven in part by soaring rates of murder and gang violence back home.\par \par \uc2 Many Central American children and mothers who arrived in the recent border surge have told officials they were trying to escape violence; some have applied for political asylum or other forms of deportation relief. Those cases have been working their way through immigration courts, but legal aid lawyers say few have been finalized.\par \par \uc2 "The Obama administration is putting families and children on the same level as criminals and terrorists," said \uc2 Wendy Young\uc2 , executive director of Kids in Need of Defense, a Washington-based legal aid agency. "Even if these families do have final deportation orders and their window for appeal has expired, do we know if they had fair hearings, or had access to counsel, or understood the process?"\par \par \uc2 In one of the raids conducted last weekend, agents took a woman who had been in their custody for a month back to her house outside Atlanta to pick up her two young sons so that all three could be sent to a deportation center in Texas.\par \par \uc2 Dominga Rivas, 27, a restaurant cook from El Salvador, had been stopped by police for making a wrong turn. She was reported to ICE as an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  and handed over to federal agents. When she arrived home early Saturday, her sons, ages 4 and 7, were still sleeping, relatives said.\par \par \uc2 "The boys were frightened, and Dominga was crying," said her sister, Doris Rivas, 33, a hairdresser who has temporary legal status. "They sent a woman agent to the bedroom and gave them five minutes to get dressed and put their things in a plastic bag. It was such an ugly thing to see."\par \par \uc2 Rivas said her sister fled El Salvador in 2014 because her abusive ex-husband had become involved with gangs and threatened to kill her. She applied for asylum after reaching the United States but was turned down.\par \par \uc2 "If she goes back, her life will be in danger, and so will the boys', because soon the gangs will start pressuring them to join or be killed," Rivas said. "Nobody can survive in my country now."\par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com\par \par \uc2 WP20160110atlantaraids0108\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020160110ec1a0002c\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved   \par \par \uc2 It is quiet now, a little too quiet, along the suburban avenues lined with Salvadoran pupusa shops and Guatemalan bakeries. The stores are emptier than usual, and some of the waitresses and clerks are not showing up at work. Everyone seems to know about last weekend's raids, when immigration agents pounded on doors before dawn and took mothers and children away.\par \par \uc2 The deportations have brought the divisive issue of illegal immigration once again to the political forefront. The raids were the first large-scale effort to deport families who had fled violence and poverty in Central America in 2014 and 2015. More than 100,000 families with adults and children crossed the southwestern border.\par \par \uc2 Despite an uproar from liberal Democrats and Latino advocacy groups, administration officials said Friday that they intend to continue the raids, hoping to send a signal and prevent a repeat of the huge surge in illegal border crossings. Although the numbers dipped last spring, a new spike saw more than 10,000 children reach the border in October and November alone.\par \par \uc2 "The enforcement strategy and priorities that the administration has articulated are not going to change," White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Friday. "Individuals who recently crossed the border are priorities for removal."\par \par \uc2 Earnest noted that after immigration reform efforts failed in Congress, President Obama acted on his own to shield from deportation 700,000 young illegal immigrants who had been here for years. "You have a president of the United States who has worked hard to use his own executive authority to try to make the process more fair," he said.\par \par \uc2 Some Democratic leaders, including House Whip Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.), have expressed concern about the raids, and Rep. Luis V. Gutierrez (D-Ill.) and other members of the \uc2 Congressional Hispanic Caucus\uc2  are calling on Obama to offer affected families temporary legal protection.\par \par \uc2 "We have a refugee crisis, not an immigration problem," Gutierrez said at a rally outside the White House on Friday. Alluding to the epidemic of drugs and gang violence that experts say is fueling the exodus from Central America, Gutierrez said, "We, too, are responsible."\par \par \uc2 In all, 121 mothers and children were detained in three states last weekend and sent to federal detention facilities, U.S. officials say. Federal officials said the families targeted for deportation had been processed by immigration courts.\par \par \uc2 The raids sowed fear and confusion in communities including Atlanta, Houston, Los Angeles and the greater Washington region, home to tens of thousands of Central Americans. At a time when some Republican presidential hopefuls talk of ridding the country of all of its 11 million illegal immigrants, the crackdown by a Democratic administration has many wondering if they, too, will be targeted.\par \par \uc2 "People are very confused," said Adelina Nicholls, executive director of the Georgia Latino Alliance for Human Rights. "They hear there are raids going on, but they don't know why, and they worry they will be affected, too."\par \par \uc2 Agents in the bushes\par \par \uc2 Rene Morales was jolted awake just after 4 a.m. last Saturday in the leafy Atlanta suburb of Stone Mountain. His doorbell was buzzing, and someone was pounding on the door. He peered out the window to see a dozen armed federal agents standing among rose bushes and Christmas lights.\par \par \uc2 They had come for his sister Rosa Vargas and her children, who fled their native Guatemala and walked across the Texas border in July 2014. Morales said Vargas, 36, decided to head north after she witnessed a murder and was threatened by gang members.\par \par \uc2 "The whole family agreed she would be better off leaving, that she should come here because she would be safe in America," said Morales, 30, a carpenter with temporary legal status. He said Vargas was issued a work permit and a Social Security number when she was released from border detention in 2014 and found work cleaning houses in Atlanta after coming to live with him.\par \par \uc2 The agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement "made me wait outside while they went upstairs," Morales said. "They said they had an order from a judge. They didn't hurt anyone, but they shouted a lot."\par \par \uc2 After allowing the family to dress and gather a few belongings, the agents put Vargas, 17-year-old Juan and 11-year-old Dankilia into vans and drove off, Morales said. Vargas's older daughter was allowed to stay behind with her year-old son, who was born in the United States.\par \par \uc2 By Monday, the others were in a detention center in Texas awaiting deportation, while a lawyer tried to file an emergency appeal.\par \par \uc2 "Together we were a family, and we made this house a home," Morales said. "Now there is nothing."\par \par \uc2 The raids in the greater Atlanta area were quick, quiet and isolated, advocates said, targeting perhaps a dozen individual homes and apartments across a large metropolitan region. In each case, ICE officials said, the families had been processed by immigration courts, where they had either been denied special relief from deportation or had not applied for it.\par \par \uc2 Since the raids, advocacy groups here and elsewhere have set up hotlines, held emergency neighborhood meetings and put out website alerts telling people they have the right not to open their doors to ICE agents or provide them with information. Legal aid groups have been deluged with calls from frantic immigrants who think agents are headed their way.\par \par \uc2 "Of course we are all worried," said Francisco Perez, a bakery owner from Guatemala who has been here for 12 years. "One hears that now they are separating families, parents from children, even people with work permits. One feels so defenseless."\par \par \uc2 Searching for safety\par \par \uc2 Atlanta's Latino population has a well-established economic niche but a tense relationship with police and government authorities, advocates say. There have been long-running battles over legal issues such as what immigration status one needs to obtain a driver's license.\par \par \uc2 Georgia is one of several states that have passed tough laws limiting the rights of noncitizens, and numerous police departments here have formal agreements to inform ICE when an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  is arrested.\par \par \uc2 Most illegal immigrants in the state are Mexicans who migrated here to pick crops or work in poultry plants and factories. But a growing minority have arrived from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, driven in part by soaring rates of murder and gang violence back home.\par \par \uc2 Many Central American children and mothers who arrived in the recent border surge have told officials they were trying to escape violence; some have applied for political asylum or other forms of deportation relief. Those cases have been working their way through immigration courts, but legal aid lawyers say few have been finalized.\par \par \uc2 "The Obama administration is putting families and children on the same level as criminals and terrorists," said \uc2 Wendy Young\uc2 , executive director of Kids in Need of Defense, a Washington-based legal aid agency. "Even if these families do have final deportation orders and their window for appeal has expired, do we know if they had fair hearings, or had access to counsel, or understood the process?"\par \par \uc2 In one of the raids conducted last weekend, agents took a woman who had been in their custody for a month back to her house outside Atlanta to pick up her two young sons so that all three could be sent to a deportation center in Texas.\par \par \uc2 Dominga Rivas, 27, a restaurant cook from El Salvador, had been stopped by police for making a wrong turn. She was reported to ICE as an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  and handed over to federal agents. When she arrived home early Saturday, her sons, ages 4 and 7, were still sleeping, relatives said.\par \par \uc2 "The boys were frightened, and Dominga was crying," said her sister, Doris Rivas, 33, a hairdresser who has temporary legal status. "They sent a woman agent to the bedroom and gave them five minutes to get dressed and put their things in a plastic bag. It was such an ugly thing to see."\par \par \uc2 Rivas said her sister fled El Salvador in 2014 because her abusive ex-husband had become involved with gangs and threatened to kill her. She applied for asylum after reaching the United States but was turned down.\par \par \uc2 "If she goes back, her life will be in danger, and so will the boys', because soon the gangs will start pressuring them to join or be killed," Rivas said. "Nobody can survive in my country now."\par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com\par \par \uc2 WP20160109atlantaraids0108\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020160109ec1900011\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ATLANTA \u8212\'20\'14 It is quiet now, a little too quiet, along the suburban avenues lined with Salvadoran pupusa shops and Guatemalan bakeries. The stores are emptier than usual, and some of the waitresses and clerks are not showing up at work. Everyone seems to know about last weekend's raids, when immigration agents pounded on doors before dawn and took mothers and children away.\par \par \uc2 The deportations have brought the divisive issue of illegal immigration once again to the political forefront. The raids were the first large-scale effort to deport families who had fled violence and poverty in Central America in 2014 and 2015. More than 100,000 families with adults and children crossed the southwestern border.\par \par \uc2 Despite an uproar from liberal Democrats and Latino advocacy groups, administration officials said Friday that they intend to continue the raids, hoping to send a signal and prevent a repeat of the huge surge in illegal border crossings. Although the numbers dipped last spring, a new spike saw more than 10,000 children reach the border in October and November alone.\par \par \uc2 "The enforcement strategy and priorities that the administration has articulated are not going to change," White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Friday. "Individuals who recently crossed the border are priorities for removal."\par \par \uc2 Earnest noted that after immigration reform efforts failed in Congress, Obama acted on his own to shield from deportation 700,000 young illegal immigrants who had been here for years. "You have a president of the United States who has worked hard to use his own executive authority to try to make the process more fair," he said.\par \par \uc2 Some Democratic leaders, including House Whip Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.), have expressed concern about the raids, and Rep. Luis V. Gutierrez (D-Ill.) and other members of the \uc2 Congressional Hispanic Caucus\uc2  are calling on Obama to offer affected families temporary legal protection.\par \par \uc2 "We have a refugee crisis, not an immigration problem," Gutierrez said at a rally outside the White House on Friday. Alluding to the epidemic of drugs and gang violence that experts say is fueling the exodus from Central America, Gutierrez said, "We, too, are responsible."\par \par \uc2 In all, 121 mothers and children were detained in three states last weekend and sent to federal detention facilities, U.S. officials say. Federal officials said the families targeted for deportation had been processed by immigration courts.\par \par \uc2 The raids sowed fear and confusion in communities including Atlanta, Houston, Los Angeles and the greater Washington region, home to tens of thousands of Central Americans. At a time when some Republican presidential hopefuls talk of ridding the country of all of its 11\u160\'00\'A0million illegal immigrants, the crackdown by a Democratic administration has many wondering if they, too, will be targeted.\par \par \uc2 "People are very confused," said Adelina Nicholls, executive director of the Georgia Latino Alliance for Human Rights. "They hear there are raids going on, but they don't know why, and they worry they will be affected, too."\par \par \uc2 Rene Morales was jolted awake just after 4\u160\'00\'A0a.m. last Saturday in the leafy Atlanta suburb of Stone Mountain. His doorbell was buzzing, and someone was pounding on the door. He peered out the window to see a dozen armed federal agents standing among rose bushes and Christmas lights.\par \par \uc2 They had come for his sister Rosa Vargas and her children, who fled their native Guatemala and walked across the Texas border in July 2014. Morales said Vargas, 36, decided to head north after she witnessed a murder and was threatened by gang members.\par \par \uc2 "The whole family agreed she would be better off leaving, that she should come here because she would be safe in America," said Morales, 30, a carpenter with temporary legal status. He said Vargas was issued a work permit and a Social Security number when she was released from border detention in 2014 and found work cleaning houses in Atlanta after coming to live with him.\par \par \uc2 The agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement "made me wait outside while they went upstairs," Morales said. "They said they had an order from a judge. They didn't hurt anyone, but they shouted a lot."\par \par \uc2 After allowing the family to dress and gather a few belongings, the agents put Vargas, 17-year-old Juan and 11-year-old Dankilia into vans and drove off, Morales said. Vargas's older daughter was allowed to stay behind with her year-old son, who was born in the United States.\par \par \uc2 By Monday, the others were in a detention center in Texas awaiting deportation, while a lawyer tried to file an emergency appeal.\par \par \uc2 "Together we were a family, and we made this house a home," Morales said. "Now there is nothing."\par \par \uc2 The raids in the greater Atlanta area were quick, quiet and isolated, advocates said, targeting perhaps a dozen individual homes and apartments across a large metropolitan region. In each case, ICE officials said, the families had been processed by immigration courts, where they had either been denied special relief from deportation or had not applied for it.\par \par \uc2 Since the raids, advocacy groups here and elsewhere have set up hotlines, held emergency neighborhood meetings and put out website alerts telling people they have the right not to open their doors to ICE agents or provide them with information. Legal aid groups have been deluged with calls from frantic immigrants who think agents are headed their way.\par \par \uc2 "Of course we are all worried," said Francisco Perez, a bakery owner from Guatemala who has been here for 12\u160\'00\'A0years. "One hears that now they are separating families, parents from children, even people with work permits. One feels so defenseless."\par \par \uc2 Atlanta's Latino population has a well-established economic niche but a tense relationship with police and government authorities, advocates say. There have been long-running battles over legal issues such as what immigration status one needs to obtain a driver's license.\par \par \uc2 Georgia is one of several states that have passed tough laws limiting the rights of noncitizens, and numerous police departments here have formal agreements to inform ICE when an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  is arrested.\par \par \uc2 Most illegal immigrants in the state are Mexicans who migrated here to pick crops or work in poultry plants and factories. But a growing minority have arrived from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, driven in part by soaring rates of murder and gang violence back home.\par \par \uc2 Many Central American children and mothers who arrived in the recent border surge have told officials they were trying to escape violence; some have applied for political asylum or other forms of deportation relief. Those cases have been working their way through immigration courts, but legal aid lawyers say few have been finalized.\par \par \uc2 "The Obama administration is putting families and children on the same level as criminals and terrorists," said \uc2 Wendy Young\uc2 , executive director of Kids in Need of Defense, a Washington-based legal aid agency. "Even if these families do have final deportation orders and their window for appeal has expired, do we know if they had fair hearings, or had access to counsel, or understood the process?"\par \par \uc2 In one of the raids conducted last weekend, agents took a woman who had been in their custody for a month back to her house outside Atlanta to pick up her two young sons so that all three could be sent to a deportation center in Texas.\par \par \uc2 Dominga Rivas, 27, a restaurant cook from El Salvador, had been stopped by police for making a wrong turn. She was reported to ICE as an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  and handed over to federal agents. When she arrived home early Saturday, her sons, ages 4 and 7, were still sleeping, relatives said.\par \par \uc2 "The boys were frightened and Dominga was crying," said her sister, Doris Rivas, 33, a hairdresser who has temporary legal status. "They sent a woman agent to the bedroom and gave them five minutes to get dressed and put their things in a plastic bag. It was such an ugly thing to see."\par \par \uc2 Rivas said her sister fled El Salvador in 2014 because her abusive ex-husband had become involved with gangs and threatened to kill her. She applied for asylum after reaching the United States but was turned down.\par \par \uc2 "If she goes back, her life will be in danger, and so will the boys', because soon the gangs will start pressuring them to join or be killed," Rivas said. "Nobody can survive in my country now."\par \par \uc2 pamela.constable@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020160108ec18003jt\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 June 15, 2015\par \par \uc2 It is an oppressively humid day in South Florida and Jeb Bush has come home to declare his candidacy for president. The big crowd assembled at Miami Dade College is festive \u8212\'20\'14 and diverse, reflecting the culture of Miami that has shaped the former governor for decades and the kind of openness he believes his party needs to win the White House. Bush has had a difficult spring, his candidacy buffeted by criticism and self-inflicted wounds. But in many circles he is still seen as the politician to beat for the Republican nomination.\par \par \uc2 His speech evokes what he hopes voters will see in him, someone with executive experience, conservative values and a reformer's instinct \u8212\'20\'14 and perhaps above all, electability. "I will take nothing and no one for granted," he says. The speech draws strong reviews, his best moment yet. For Bush, it is a day to put his problems behind him and begin the campaign anew.\par \par \uc2 June 16, 2015\par \par \uc2 The scene at Trump Tower on New York's Fifth Avenue is surreal. Down the escalator, his image reflecting on the walls around the lobby, comes Donald Trump, the billionaire developer and reality TV star. The crowd gathered in the lobby is large and boisterous. Later it will be revealed that some were paid to attend \u8212\'20\'14 an arrangement the candidate would not long need.\par \par \uc2 Trump is there to announce, to the surprise of so many, that he will seek the White House. He has flirted with this before but always stopped short. Now he says he is in. His speech is seemingly off the cuff. He goes after China and President Obama and then turns to immigration. Mexico is sending their worst across the border, he says \u8212\'20\'14 drug dealers, rapists and murderers among them. The language is harsh \u8212\'20\'14 shocking to many \u8212\'20\'14 and draws instant condemnations. For the novice politician, it is an inauspicious start to the campaign.\par \par \uc2 THE YEAR 2015 will be remembered as one of the most bizarrely compelling and genuinely unnerving in the nation's modern political history.\par \par \uc2 It is clear now that there were two halves to the year for the Republican Party: BT and AT, Before Trump and After Trump. From January to mid-June the story of the Republican race was mostly conventional, with Bush the focal point for good and ill. There were unanticipated twists, among them the sheer size of the field of candidates \u8212\'20\'14 ultimately a total of 17 who would formally declare.\par \par \uc2 Those early months, however, were only a prelude to the real events that would follow. It is hardly overstatement to say that, on June 16, everything changed \u8212\'20\'14 though no one knew it at the time, not even Donald Trump.\par \par \uc2 Trump's entry brought scorn and dismissal. He was a clown, a carnival barker, the leading man in a sideshow with a short run. His outrageous rhetoric \u8212\'20\'14 an appeal to nativism and antipathy toward everything from institutional powers to cultural shifts \u8212\'20\'14 seemed to guarantee all that.\par \par \uc2 Yet even on that day in June there were signs that the elites in the party and in the political community didn't get what was stirring. From New York, Trump flew to Iowa for a rally at Hoyt Sherman Auditorium in Des Moines, where he was cheered as he strode down the aisle to the front stage.\par \par \uc2 Don and Kathy Watson were among those who had come to see him. Asked why Trump, she replied: "Why not? He's as good as anybody. .\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09. He's not afraid. He's not a politician." They weren't certain they would support Trump, but they knew which candidate they would not support: Bush. "Dump him. We've had too many Bushes," she said.\par \par \uc2 Trump's reception that night showed that whatever the party establishment thought of him, many voters found him instantly attractive. Those early sentiments underscored the festering emotions that would soon burst forth, frustrations born of economic stress and disgust with Washington.\par \par \uc2 By the end of the year, every candidate running for the nomination could sense it \u8212\'20\'14 and all were trying to adapt, channeling the anger as best they could. Some adapted well, and may yet win the nomination. Others didn't make it to the New Year.\par \par \uc2 Aboard his campaign bus in Iowa two days before the arrival of 2016, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida reflected on what he had seen and felt through the amazing year of 2015.\par \par \uc2 "People are just tired," he said. "They've tried Democrats, they've tried Republicans. They've tried a combination of both. They've tried new people, they've tried old people and nothing changes. Things get worse. They don't seem to get better, no matter who's in charge; it feels like the country is stuck in neutral and people are fed up and that's what brings us to the point where we're at today."\par \par \uc2 What Rubio said was an echo of what almost every Republican candidate was saying by the end of the year. But as the election year opens, the lingering question \u8212\'20\'14 the big unknown \u8212\'20\'14 is whether 2015 will prove to be an aberration, a holiday from reality or a portent of things to come.\par \par \uc2 What is clearest is what didn't work in 2015, though it often worked in the past. Television advertising moved few voters. Policy rollouts fell on deaf ears. Impressive political r\u233\'00\'E9sum\u233\'00\'E9s proved not to be persuasive. What took on the Republican side was a new kind of politics, one built on emotion and visceral connection. To some people, this represented a worrying turn toward a darker and more divisive politics. To others, it was a welcome turn away from what they considered to be too much political correctness.\par \par \uc2 Rick Santorum said of Trump: "He may have understood the game better than any of us." But like so many people, the former senator from Pennsylvania wondered whether the billionaire mogul understands the game ahead. It is the question that hovers over everything in politics at this moment.\par \par \uc2 "I think the vote is much different than a poll and so I want to see what happens when people actually vote," \uc2 New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie\uc2  said in evaluating 2015. "Then we can start talking about eras being defined or newly established."\par \par \uc2 The answer will come soon enough. What follows is the story of how Republicans got to where they are today, told primarily through the impressions, recollections and analyses of those who lived it personally \u8212\'20\'14 the Republican candidates. This article is based almost entirely on on-the-record interviews with most of the major candidates \u8212\'20\'14 some of whom fell away \u8212\'20\'14 and with their advisers and other strategists. It is the story of a remarkable year in American politics.\par \par \uc2 THE QUESTION THAT HOVERED over the Republican Party a year ago was very different: Will he or won't he?\par \par \uc2 In late 2014, the he in question was Jeb Bush. A son and brother of presidents. A towering figure in Florida politics. A cerebral executive celebrated for his policy chops and conservative record as governor. Though hobbled by his support for immigration reform and Common Core educational standards, Bush was seen by party elites as a man literally groomed for the office \u8212\'20\'14 a president at the ready.\par \par \uc2 The reality would prove to be more complicated. Out of office for eight years, Bush was rusty, and through the fights of the Obama era that reordered the political right, he was largely absent.\par \par \uc2 To demonstrate that he was in touch with politics in the age of social media, Bush went on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  on Dec. 17 to declare that he was actively exploring a run. The announcement landed like a thunderclap, instantly thrusting him to the top and undercutting a slew of other establishment hopefuls, especially Christie and Rubio.\par \par \uc2 "Any time someone with the last name Bush gets into a national race, the first impact you feel is fundraising, and that's certainly the one that we felt most immediately," Christie would later recall. "A lot of people started to sign on with him before we'd even gotten off the ground. It was his attempt, I think, to preempt the field."\par \par \uc2 Sally Bradshaw, senior adviser to the Bush campaign, said there was no expectation of clearing the field \u8212\'20\'14 quite the opposite. "We knew this would be a more crowded and talented field than 2012 and we knew the electorate was angry at President Obama," she said. "We assumed there would be an establishment candidate or several and an anger candidate.Our assumption was that [the anger candidate] would be Ted Cruz. No one anticipated a Trump candidacy at that point."\par \par \uc2 Bush's aggressive effort to raise funds in early 2015, Bradshaw said, reflected the campaign team's assumption that the nomination contest would be highly competitive and potentially lengthy.\par \par \uc2 "Shock and awe" is how it came to be called, to the chagrin of Bradshaw and others. Still, it was a genuine blitzkrieg. Bush's advisers established Right to Rise, a super PAC that could accept unlimited contributions, and it vacuumed up big checks by the day. On Jan. 9, it received its first $1 million contribution, from Los Angeles investment banker Brad Freeman. By February, Bush was averaging one fundraiser a day and regularly headlining events with a minimum price tag of $100,000 a person, such as the Feb. 11 gathering at the Park Avenue home of private-equity titan Henry Kravis.\par \par \uc2 Longtime Bush family fundraiser Fred Zeidman recalled: "Everyone was enthusiastic, everyone was writing checks. That had always been the benchmark. Money has been the way you keep score."\par \par \uc2 The intense early pace startled Bush's likely opponents. "I think everybody was a little surprised as to not just the timing but how successful he was early on," Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker recalled later.\par \par \uc2 Donors who had been contemplating backing Christie, Rubio or Walker were suddenly on board with Bush. "Are they raising a lot of money? Yeah," \uc2 Ray Washburne\uc2  , a Dallas real estate developer who was leading Christie's fundraising efforts, said at the time. Washburne's candidate was not. "We're in the making-friends stage."\par \par \uc2 The swaggering entrance of Bush was perhaps most acutely felt by Rubio. Bush's onetime prot\u233\'00\'E9g\u233\'00\'E9, Rubio enjoyed an overlapping donor network with him, especially in their shared home state of Florida. Yet at the onset of the so-called invisible primary, many of these people were publicly signing on with Bush before Rubio could even make the hard sell.\par \par \uc2 "It just changes completely the way you have to go out and raise money," Rubio recalled later. He said he resorted to building a more grass-roots donor network, as he did in his 2010 Senate race when he began far behind the hand-picked candidate of party leaders, then-Gov. Charlie Crist. "You have to find new people that haven't traditionally been involved in the past, but want to see a change in America."\par \par \uc2 As Bush jetted from mansion to mansion securing donors, Bradshaw and Bush's longtime political consigliere, Mike Murphy, were mapping out the campaign. They were confident about Bush's chances to be the nominee. Sure, he would have to overcome America's historical aversion to dynastic politics and the country's lingering distaste for the George W. Bush years. But he would easily establish his own political identity, they figured. He had done it in Florida. His campaign signs and bumper stickers always bore the logo, "Jeb!," with a giant red exclamation point emphasizing that he was not just another Bush. They would do so again.\par \par \uc2 Bradshaw and Murphy envisioned the general election against \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 , the presumed Democratic nominee. They would try to master the data and digital frontier that Obama so effectively exploited and that had bedeviled Republicans. Bush would visit urban areas and tour schools in impoverished neighborhoods. He would deliver an optimistic pitch to the middle class. He would woo Latinos with a compassionate approach to immigration, by campaigning in Spanish and by showcasing his Mexican American wife and blended family. His slogan would be "right to rise," a shot for everyone to climb up the income ladder.\par \par \uc2 Out in the heartland, there were rumblings of resistance among the constituency that had not yet shown much interest in a third Bush presidency: voters. A dozen Denver-area residents \u8212\'20\'14 Republicans, Democrats and independents \u8212\'20\'14 registered a startlingly negative view on Bush during a two-hour focus group moderated by Democratic pollster Peter Hart for the \uc2 Annenberg Public Policy Center\uc2  at the \uc2 University of Pennsylvania\uc2  .\par \par \uc2 When an information technology program manager named Charlie Loan, a Republican-leaning independent, said half-seriously that he would be happy to see Congress pass a law banning anyone named Bush or Clinton from running for president, half the people in the room agreed. And when the participants were asked for short impressions of Bush, the responses included: "No, thank you;" "Greedy;" and, "Again?" The closest anyone came to showing enthusiasm for Bush was, "intriguing."\par \par \uc2 AS BUSH WAS FAST BUILDING his juggernaut, a threat emerged on the horizon. Mitt Romney, who had run for president twice before, had grown restless in the two years since conceding to Obama. The world seemed like it was on fire; back home, the middle class was getting crushed. Romney was itching to get back in the game, to have a shot at turning things around.\par \par \uc2 One night in early January, aboard a red-eye flight from San Francisco to Boston, Romney wrote in his journal: "If I want to be president, I'm going to have to run for president."\par \par \uc2 In Romney's mind, there was no if. And at a Jan. 9 gathering of some of his top 2012 campaign donors in Manhattan, hosted by \uc2 New York Jets\uc2  owner Woody Johnson, he made his feelings known. "I want to be president," Romney told the assembled financiers.\par \par \uc2 Romney's surprising declaration electrified the Republican money and operative class and set off a tumultuous three-week period of public deliberation.\par \par \uc2 "This wasn't going to happen by a claim of some kind or other people having a difficult time getting traction and then people turning to me and asking me to run," Romney recalled thinking at the time. "If I wanted to be president, it was a decision I had to make. And Jeb, I think very wisely, had begun raising money and getting things started early on, so the time frame to make that decision was earlier than I might have thought."\par \par \uc2 Romney called his former donors, dozens of them, and received encouraging feedback. His chief fundraiser, Spencer Zwick, estimated that they could raise the $100 million or so necessary to get through the primaries. Longtime adviser Beth Myers assured him he could assemble a top-notch staff.\par \par \uc2 Strategist Stuart Stevens kept counseling Romney to make a personal decision, not a political one, though Romney studied the politics closely. Chicago investor Muneer Satter, a GOP mega-donor, commissioned polls from a dozen or so states and showed the data to Romney.\par \par \uc2 "Am I loved? Am I written off? Am I despised? What does the Republican base think about me?" Romney recalled wondering.\par \par \uc2 He liked what he saw. Romney said the polls showed him with commanding leads among potential Republican candidates in New Hampshire and Nevada and a smaller lead in Iowa. In South Carolina, he was tied at the top with Bush and others.\par \par \uc2 "It's like, 'Wow. Wow.' That's not a bad place to start from," Romney said in a late-December interview in Boston at the well-appointed offices of \uc2 Solamere Capital\uc2  , the private equity firm run by Zwick and Romney's eldest son, Tagg.\par \par \uc2 Romney thought that if he got in, he was better positioned than anybody else to get the nomination. He was more concerned about the general election. He saw Clinton \u8212\'20\'14 because of both the historic nature of her candidacy and the demographic advantages Democrats enjoy at the presidential level \u8212\'20\'14 as a formidable opponent.\par \par \uc2 The reaction outside Romney's orbit was less rosy. Governors, senators and other Republican leaders called him a decent man who has served the party well, but said his time had passed.\par \par \uc2 On the right, the criticism was sharper. The Wall Street Journal editorial board lacerated him in a column headlined, "Romney Recycled." \uc2 Rupert Murdoch\uc2  , whose company owns the Journal and Fox News Channel, said: "He had his chance, he mishandled it, you know? I thought Romney was a terrible candidate." Talk radio host Mark Levin summed up the sentiment in a tweet: "Been there, done that."\par \par \uc2 Of the barrage of negativity, Romney suspected a culprit: "I recognized the hand of my good friend, Mike Murphy, [who] in my view was fanning the flames of, 'No, he's the disaster. It would be terrible. Only Jeb!' I must admit that had the opposite effect [than] he might have intended, which is just like, 'I'll show them.'\u8201\'20\'09"\par \par \uc2 Murphy, the Bush adviser, said this was "absolutely not true" and that he did not talk down Romney's chances with commentators, governors or senators. "I'm sorry he thinks that," Murphy said, noting his long relationship with Romney. "I think the doubts were more organic than he believes."\par \par \uc2 Romney believed that, if he passed on the race, Bush would be the most likely nominee. Privately, he harbored serious doubts about Bush's ability to beat Clinton. He recalled thinking, "I like Jeb a lot, I think he'd be a great president, but felt he was unfairly but severely burdened by the W. years \u8212\'20\'14 and when I say the W. years, it's not only what happened to the economy, but the tragedy in Iraq." He added, "A Bush-versus-Clinton head-to-head would be too easy for the Democrats."\par \par \uc2 On Jan. 22, Bush flew to Utah, where the Romneys were settling into a new home in the Salt Lake City suburb of Holladay, to pay Mitt a courtesy visit. The date had been set long before Romney expressed interest in running. The two men exchanged pleasantries and updated each other on their growing families; four days earlier, Romney's 23rd grandchild was born.\par \par \uc2 Then they got down to business. Romney told Bush about the private polls that showed him performing well in the early voting states. "It's opened up a door that I didn't think would be open to me," he recalled telling Bush.\par \par \uc2 Romney also said he confronted Bush with his fears about his candidacy: "Jeb, to be very honest, I think it's very hard for you to post up against \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  and to separate yourself from the difficulty of the W. years and compare them with the Clinton years." He said Bush responded by saying that "he was going to make his campaign about the future, not about the past."\par \par \uc2 "I didn't say anything at that point," Romney recalled. "But as he left, I said to myself, 'Gosh, in my opinion, it's not going to be as easy to make that separation as I think he gives the impression it will be.' One of the few things I predicted that turned out to be true."\par \par \uc2 Bush, through a spokesman, declined repeated requests to be interviewed. Bradshaw said: "We don't talk about meetings that we consider to be private. We're honoring Governor Bush's commitment to Governor Romney to keep the meeting private. Governor Bush appreciates what Mitt did in waging an able campaign and leading our ticket."\par \par \uc2 With his exploration continuing in public, Romney more and more was leaning against running. Wife Ann supported the idea and wanted Mitt to be president, but their five sons were split. Tagg and Josh were for it, Matt and Craig were against it and Ben was on the fence. Romney suspected their wives were opposed, though they kept their opinions to themselves.\par \par \uc2 Romney privately consulted two of his closest friends in elected office: Rep. Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, his 2012 vice presidential running-mate whom he earlier had been badgering to run himself to no avail; and Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio. They didn't discourage Romney, but neither did they push him to jump in.\par \par \uc2 "They were friendly and encouraging," Romney recalled, "but cautious and saying, 'Gosh, we need an elder statesman in the party. .\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09. If you get into the race, why it diminishes you. You're now one of the big crowd of people running and you lose the impact you could have had.' And they said, 'Maybe you're not as able to win the general as perhaps someone coming along.'\u8201\'20\'09"\par \par \uc2 Romney was arriving at the same conclusion. He remembered thinking, "It's going to take something unusual, something catching lightning in a jar to beat [Clinton], and the guy who ran before isn't very likely to catch lightning in a jar. I'm too well known. I'm too well defined."\par \par \uc2 On Jan. 30, exactly three weeks after declaring in New York that he wanted to be president, Romney announced that he was giving up on the dream. He did so with what many interpreted as a knock against the front-runner, Bush.\par \par \uc2 "I believe that one of our next generation of Republican leaders \u8212\'20\'14 one who may not be as well-known as I am today, one who has not yet taken their message across the country, one who is just getting started \u8212\'20\'14 may well emerge as being better able to defeat the Democratic nominee," Romney said. "In fact, I expect and hope that to be the case."\par \par \uc2 SOME OF THOSE YOUNG STARS Romney had in mind were fresh off another successful midterm election. Descending on Florida for the \uc2 Republican Governors Association\uc2  's annual meeting, they were ebullient and looking ahead to their possible White House runs. It was only November of 2014, but the corridors of the ornate Boca Raton Resort & Club were a grand bazaar of political gossip and speculation. Greg Abbott, just elected governor of Texas, joked, "I think everyone in this building is running for president."\par \par \uc2 AS THEY LOOKED toward 2016, many Republicans believed the nomination battle would become a fight among the governors.\par \par \uc2 The state executives were stars in the party, seen as models of conservative governance in contrast to the dysfunctional family of Republicans in Congress. Moreover, at a time of public disenchantment with President Obama, who was elected more on charisma than experience and whom Republicans derided as never having run anything before, the governors thought they would be the likeliest antidote.\par \par \uc2 The list of prospective candidates from these ranks was long: the outgoing Texas governor \uc2 Rick Perry\uc2  , who after a record 14 years in office could boast of sizeable job creation numbers; Christie, who began 2014 in scandal surrounding the closure of lanes leading to the George Washington Bridge but ended it taking a victory lap as outgoing \uc2 Republican Governors Association\uc2  chair; Ohio Gov. John Kasich, newly reelected in a landslide in one of the most important swing states in the country; Walker, nationally known among conservatives for his battles with unions and who won three tough elections in four years; and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, a policy wonk and idea generator.\par \par \uc2 Those were just the sitting governors. Beyond that were the former governors: Bush, \uc2 Mike Huckabee\uc2  (Ark.), \uc2 George Pataki\uc2  (N.Y.) and \uc2 Jim Gilmore\uc2  (Va.).\par \par \uc2 Governors appeared to have the best of both worlds: experienced as chief executives and able to portray themselves as Washington outsiders. As Walker explained more than a year later, governors "could all make an argument that we were outside of Washington, that we're getting things done, that we were part of a movement of governors across the country \u8211\'20\'13 all of which is accurate."\par \par \uc2 Many of the governors who were preparing to run had one overriding goal in mind: to become the alternative to Bush. In Bush's camp, the other governors loomed largest as potential competitors, although which one was most threatening remained a mystery.\par \par \uc2 Perry, who had run a disastrous race for president in 2012 and had spent two years preparing for a second campaign, already could see the landscape ahead \u8212\'20\'14 a nomination contest that ultimately would come down to a competition between two men who had led two of the biggest states in the country.\par \par \uc2 "I full well thought that by the fall of 2015, Jeb Bush, \uc2 Rick Perry\uc2  were going to be on the stage having a thoughtful conversation about each of our competing visions for America and us comparing our records of success," Perry said in a December interview.\par \par \uc2 Perry judged himself and Bush to be "two of the most successful Republican governors maybe in the history of the country." Surely, he believed, "the American people would distill down which of these individuals had the best vision for America. .\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09. It was going to be me and Jeb."\par \par \uc2 The challenge was to break out from the pack. The first to do so was Walker, who delivered a fiery speech on Jan. 24 in Iowa at a day-long Freedom Summit, sponsored by the group \uc2 Citizens United\uc2  and hosted by Rep. Steve King, one of the most conservative members of Congress.\par \par \uc2 By showing real passion, the bland politician had surprised those who didn't know him \u8212\'20\'14 including many in the national press corps who had descended on Des Moines for the first major Republican event of the cycle. Conservative talk radio was abuzz about him. For days on end, Rush Limbaugh hailed the Wisconsinite as the cure to what ails the Republican Party.\par \par \uc2 At the time, Walker later recalled, he found it amusing. "I laughed with the coverage that came out \u8212\'20\'14 'Oh, Walker gives his breakout speech,'\u8201\'20\'09" he said. In his own mind, it was no different than the performances he delivered on factory floors or at small rallies during his reelection in the fall of 2014.\par \par \uc2 The media attention to Walker gave him a significant boost, even though others such as Cruz, the senator from Texas, and even Trump stirred the conservative audience nearly as much.\par \par \uc2 With the attention came a brighter spotlight, and Walker then suffered through a series of errors. In London, during an official state business trip, he declined to say whether he believed in evolution. In an interview, he wouldn't say whether he believed Obama was a Christian. At the annual Conservative Political Action Conference, he appeared to cast his battles with the unions as a proving ground for his capacity to deal with \uc2 Islamic State\uc2  militants.\par \par \uc2 Walker wrote off the incidents as minor problems. And the missteps did not arrest his rise, at least not then. He soon became the poll leader in Iowa and, in the quickly congealing world of conventional wisdom, was described as the principal challenger to Bush.\par \par \uc2 As he traveled the country early in the year, Walker believed he was particularly well suited for a GOP electorate whose frustrations, even with their own party leaders in Washington, he could feel.\par \par \uc2 "Part of our assessment was, I can say I'm the guy who didn't back down. If you want somebody who's going to stand up and get these sorts of things done, I can do it, I did at Wisconsin, we can do it going forward," Walker recalled. "I think that was part of our initial appeal. What we didn't see coming along the way was just how intense that frustration was."\par \par \uc2 IF GOVERNORS PLANNED to run on their records of enacting reforms back home, a trio of first-term senators were hanging their hopes on their potential to disrupt Washington's established order.\par \par \uc2 The first out of the gate was Cruz, a combative conservative who, in his 14 months in the Senate, had made many more enemies than friends. An Ivy League-educated lawyer, Cruz already had proven himself a smooth orator and wily tactician. He was best known for leading a 2013 crusade against Obama's health care law that resulted in a partial shutdown of the federal government.\par \par \uc2 Cruz arrived on the presidential stage as a hero to tea party activists, but he had another objective: to make himself a hero to evangelical Christians and libertarian conservatives, too.\par \par \uc2 "Conservatives have always outnumbered moderates in a primary, but the way moderates have won previously is by dividing conservatives," Cruz would later say. "Their strategy was to keep conservatives splintered. If conservatives ever unite, it's game over."\par \par \uc2 So on March 23, Cruz journeyed to Lynchburg, Va., to formally announce his candidacy at \uc2 Liberty University\uc2  , the private Christian college founded by televangelist \uc2 Jerry Falwell\uc2  . It was a splashy event. He spoke in the round at \uc2 Liberty\uc2  's basketball arena before 10,000 cheering students. Like a pastor, he paced around the stage, no notes in hand, and gestured theatrically. He shared history lessons, invoked the Constitution and declared himself to be an uncompromising conservative and a champion of Christian values.\par \par \uc2 Thanks to his national profile in the Senate, Cruz had a powerful network of small-dollar donors, as had conservative grass-roots candidates of presidential campaigns past. But even before announcing, he was moving stealthily and aggressively to woo wealthy power brokers in his home state of Texas, on Wall Street and beyond.\par \par \uc2 Energy investor Toby Neugebauer first met Cruz years ago and the two men, born just a few days apart, quickly clicked. Their families vacationed together. By February, Neugebauer had grown concerned there was not an effective, high-dollar super PAC operation to bolster Cruz. Neugebauer said to his wife, "Either we believe or we don't believe." And he soon approached other wealthy Cruz backers, over Texas barbecue and at Manhattan t\u234\'00\'EAte-\u224\'00\'E0-t\u234\'00\'EAtes, with a proposition: If they put $10 million into a network of super PACs, so would he.\par \par \uc2 On April 9, Neugebauer wrote a check for $10 million. The next day, hedge fund executive Robert Mercer put in $11 million. And soon enough, Farris and Dan Wilks, brothers whose fracking services business had transformed them into billionaires, and their wives anted up $15 million.\par \par \uc2 "The money made the Cruz candidacy very real," Neugebauer said, adding: "People realized, 'This isn't Michele Bachmann.'\u8201\'20\'09"\par \par \uc2 Cruz's campaign now had what no recent hard-right conservative candidate had: the resources to run a long campaign.\par \par \uc2 For \uc2 Rand Paul\uc2  in Kentucky, the ambitions on display across the Appalachian Mountains at \uc2 Liberty\uc2  represented a sudden threat, though Paul might not have recognized it at the time.\par \par \uc2 Paul, a sometimes-brusque maverick, embodied the tea party movement of 2010 when he catapulted from an ophthalmology practice in Bowling Green to the Senate. Paul's father, Ron, had rallied libertarians during two quixotic bids for the presidency. Now Rand was aiming to do what his dad never could: win the Republican nomination.\par \par \uc2 Central to Paul's hopes was expanding his base of libertarians and college students by picking up support from evangelicals. He was coming off an impressive 2014, when he traversed the country in the midterms, building alliances and courting big-league donors. He was organizing in Iowa, where some saw him as a genuine contender. Paul also was trying to grow the Republican Party's cultural reach, giving speeches about race and other topics in such liberal enclaves as Berkeley, Calif.\par \par \uc2 In a Louisville ballroom on April 7, Paul declared his candidacy: "I have a message, a message that is loud and clear and does not mince words. We have come to take our country back."\par \par \uc2 It was a day full of promise. Voters, Paul knew, were growing angry with what he derided as "the Washington machine." Who better to win the nomination than a fiercely libertarian eye doctor-turned-citizen legislator? Little did he know then that a louder, brasher and angrier outsider would soon step forward.\par \par \uc2 This was a busy week in presidential politics. That Sunday, Clinton entered the race with studied understatement: a fast-paced and folksy video that featured little of the former first lady and secretary of state in favor of a diverse assortment of Americans talking about their hopes and aspirations for the spring. "Everyday Americans need a champion," Clinton said, "and I want to be that champion."\par \par \uc2 In Miami, Rubio and his advisers could hardly believe their good fortune. In just 24 hours, the ambitious young senator was set to make his formal announcement. What better way to enter the race than with a visceral comparison to the leading Democrat?\par \par \uc2 For Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants, a compelling biography helped accelerate his ascent in Florida politics. And to accentuate his story under the national spotlight, Rubio launched his campaign at the Freedom Tower, an iconic Ellis Island-like landmark in downtown Miami where a generation earlier U.S. officials processed Cuban refugees fleeing the Castro regime.\par \par \uc2 Rubio had been elected to the Senate in 2010 after taking on and defeating the establishment. After the party's crushing defeat in the 2012 presidential election, he was a leading member of the Senate's Gang of Eight that drafted an immigration reform bill, which included a path to citizenship for those here illegally.\par \par \uc2 He walked away from the legislation when sentiment inside the party shifted against that provision. But the issue remains a flash point in the Republican race to this day \u8212\'20\'14 and potentially one of Rubio's biggest obstacles.\par \par \uc2 Rubio stepped forward under a banner that read, "A New American Century." Charismatic and boyish \u8212\'20\'14 he was 43, but could have passed for a few years younger \u8212\'20\'14 Rubio offered himself as a next-generation president for a rapidly changing world. It was time, he said, to close the books on the past. Though he didn't say their names, it was clear what he meant: the era of politics dominated by people named Clinton and Bush.\par \par \uc2 "Yesterday is over," he said, "and we are never going back."\par \par \uc2 Rubio now says his "yesterday" contrast was not only generational, but also about old ideas and stale solutions. "Ultimately, to the extent that there are people running who are not in touch with the realities of the 21st century, that contrast is going to be there," he said.\par \par \uc2 IN ALMOST EVERY PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN, someone unexpected rises toward the top of the field. In 2015, that role fell to Ben Carson, a world-renowned pediatric neurosurgeon with no political experience. He would come to symbolize the hunger among many Republicans for someone, anyone, not tainted by politics as usual.\par \par \uc2 Carson was a novice to politics but has attracted a substantial following among conservatives and evangelicals. His life story was as compelling as any of the others seeking the presidency, if not greatly more so \u8212\'20\'14 a rise from poverty in his home town of Detroit to the top ranks of the medical profession. He broke onto the political scene two years earlier at the National Prayer Breakfast, when he sharply criticized Obama, who was sitting nearby.\par \par \uc2 Carson's demeanor was jarringly calm in the high-volume world of national politics, which proved to be an early asset. But the transition from medicine, paid speaking and honorary degrees was not always smooth.\par \par \uc2 "The question at the beginning was whether we could raise money," said Barry Bennett, a GOP campaign veteran who was brought on by Carson to manage his campaign. "So we started a fundraising list as Jeb's super PAC was aiming for $100 million. That was hanging over us. We wondered, 'Could we compete?'\u8201\'20\'09"\par \par \uc2 Millions poured in from his email list, which would grow to 3 million addresses, and from direct-mail solicitations. Carson had won informal straw polls across the country and became a phenomenon of sorts on the right \u8212\'20\'14 a kinder, gentler vessel for the frustrations within the Republican base.\par \par \uc2 "It was an outpouring of emotion for an anti-establishment person, very real, and a feeling, an emotion that the polls were never able to capture," said Terry Giles, a former Carson adviser.\par \par \uc2 Carson was also a threat to some of those on the right who legitimately believed they were the rightful candidates to appeal to the wide swath of evangelical Christians who play an influential role in Iowa and many southern states.\par \par \uc2 Within weeks of Carson's declaration of candidacy, Huckabee and former senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania also joined the race. They were the two previous winners of the Iowa caucuses, both over Romney \u8212\'20\'14 Huckabee in 2008 and Santorum by an eyelash in 2012.\par \par \uc2 Both were overshadowed by conservative newcomers and struggled to regain the support they had previously enjoyed. Huckabee would compare the dynamic to junior high school and boys' fascination with the newest pretty girl in class.\par \par \uc2 "I'm seeing a lot of that in the presidential race," he said in a December interview. "It's that there's the new-girl-in-school approach where you've got so many new girls in school. Some of us, we've been here since the first grade, so we're having to just wait our turn to be remembered and liked again."\par \par \uc2 Santorum said he anticipated that this would be the year of outsiders and felt that his 2012 campaign gave him credibility to tap the anti-establishment mood. "From my perspective, that's what I did last time," he said. "I took on the establishment. Four years had passed and there were more people doing the same thing and in a real-time way. .\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09. We were not in the headlines, not top of mind. We had been out of the fray. So from my perspective, I was starting all over again."\par \par \uc2 The field of declared candidates grew quickly after Carson announced. The month of May brought in the only woman, Carly Fiorina , the former chief executive at Hewlett-Packard who lost a Senate race in California in 2010 in her only venture into politics. Also joining were Pataki and \uc2 Sen. Lindsey Graham\uc2  (S.C.). Rubio would later joke: "We live in a year when one out of six Republicans is running for president."\par \par \uc2 Perry's formal announcement came on June 4 at an airplane hangar north of Dallas. The backdrops included a C-130 transport plane similar to one that he had flown in the \uc2 Air Force\uc2  , a group of military veterans and an American flag that ran almost from floor to ceiling on one wall.\par \par \uc2 Perry's speech laid down markers that he hoped would separate him from many of the others. The 2016 election, he said, would be a "show-me, don't-tell-me" election, where voters prized records over rhetoric.\par \par \uc2 "The question of every candidate will be this one: when have you led?" he said. "Leadership is not a speech on the Senate floor. It's not what you say, it's what you do."\par \par \uc2 DESPITE THE GROWING FIELD and the unsettled nature of the polls, much of the focus in the late spring remained on Bush, who struggled to connect with voters even as he excelled at raising money. By late April, Bush had something big to tout when he addressed 350 of his top financial supporters at a two-day donor retreat at Miami Beach's 1 Hotel, an eco-friendly establishment with stunning vistas of the Atlantic Ocean.\par \par \uc2 The organization had already raised more money in 100 days than any other Republican operation in modern history, he told them. Still, some allies were restless. Why wouldn't he just make it official and launch his campaign already? Why had his fundraising success not intimidated possible rivals from entering the race?\par \par \uc2 At an April cattle-call in New Hampshire, Bush laughed when a woman said he seemed to be the establishment's chosen one and that she did not want to see a Republican coronation to match what she believed was happening with the Democrats. "I don't see any coronation coming my way," Bush responded. "Trust me."\par \par \uc2 Murphy, the strategist, tried to quiet the concerns of donors who would have been happy with a coronation. During a closed-door briefing, he laid out the long game plan for Bush to secure the nomination and shrugged off the early polls as "noise meters."\par \par \uc2 But shortly after Miami Beach, Bush inadvertently sparked another brush fire. When asked at a private donor meeting in New York in early May to whom he relied upon for advice on U.S.-Israel policy, he gave a surprising response: his brother, President Bush.\par \par \uc2 Suddenly, Bush was being pressed on the campaign trail to assess his brother's legacy and most specifically the decision to invade Iraq. He stumbled for days, initially backing his brother's decision, before asserting that, if he had known at the time that the intelligence was faulty, he would not have launched the invasion.\par \par \uc2 Bush's donors and other backers continued to express concerns privately about his prospects. In an effort to build a more nimble and effective operation, Bush announced staff changes in the days before his formal announcement. The shake-up added to the worries of many Bush loyalists, but campaign officials insisted that they were on track to win.\par \par \uc2 July 4, 2015\par \par \uc2 It is the midway point of the pre-election year, a weekend for picnics, parades and candidate sightings in New Hampshire. Mitt and Ann Romney open their spacious summer home on Lake Winnipesaukee for some guests in the area: Marco Rubio and \uc2 Chris Christie\uc2 , two rivals for the nomination, and their families. Both candidates are planning to march in the parade in nearby Wolfeboro, where the Romneys are an annual presence along the route.\par \par \uc2 Mitt Romney, in T-shirt and shorts, cooks pancakes. Ann Romney, in her robe, fries the bacon as the guests assemble for breakfast. Politics is not on the agenda. But there is little relaxing on any weekend with the Romneys at the lake. There are boat rides and a trip for ice cream and a water slide into what Rubio, conditioned to the climes of South Florida, describes as freezing water.\par \par \uc2 It is a moment of congeniality in what everyone knows will only become more heated and personal. Rubio talks some pro football. It is July and he is still hopeful that his \uc2 Miami Dolphins\uc2  will actually field a competitive team for the season. He and Christie, both still low in the polls, are quietly hopeful that their seasons ahead will be successful as well.\par \par \uc2 DONALD TRUMP'S BOEING 757 landed with a roar at Phoenix's airport on a warm July afternoon. He stepped onto the tarmac in his uniform of dark suit and red tie \u8212\'20\'14 wisps of that famous hair turned up by the wind \u8212\'20\'14 and into a waiting black GMC Denali with a "TRUMP" license plate.\par \par \uc2 For the first time since his announcement, Trump's seemingly long-shot presidential bid began to have the aura of a real, vibrating campaign: multi-city stops, a plane full of aides and security guards and piles of printed news articles about him and his rivals.\par \par \uc2 "Let's go! Let's go!" Trump said, clapping his hands in the style of a drill sergeant, as his entourage loaded into the caravan. In a region where illegal immigration has inflamed the public, Trump had come to capitalize on the issue. Approaching the venue, he marveled from behind the vehicle's tinted glass at the thousands who had come to hear what he would say.\par \par \uc2 Trump later would acknowledge that he had been taken by surprise by the power of the immigration issue. "When I made this speech about illegal immigration, I had no idea what it was going to become," Trump said. "I mean, it was an important subject to me but I had no idea it was going to resonate in the way it has."\par \par \uc2 The Phoenix rally was strategically chosen to stoke the issue further. "We really wanted to punctuate where illegal immigration has had the most impact," said Corey Lewandowski, Trump's crew-cut and rail-thin campaign manager.\par \par \uc2 Backstage that day, Trump could hear the crowd stomping its feet and breaking into spontaneous cheers as his fans waited and sang along to his mix of Broadway tunes and hard-rock classics on the loudspeakers.\par \par \uc2 But instead of relaxing in his green room, Trump never even opened the door. He met for 20 minutes with families of people who were killed by illegal immigrants, taking pictures with each relative. The Phoenix rally came just days after an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , who had been deported five times, shot and killed Kate Steinle, 32, as she walked along a pier with her father in San Francisco.\par \par \uc2 Trump treated local conservative politicians like old friends, including the controversial sheriff of Maricopa County, Joe Arpaio. He encouraged a GOP state treasurer to challenge Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) in a primary. "This is a movement," he told a Washington Post reporter that day. He said it as a way of explaining the scene. But it sounded, too, like an assurance to himself.\par \par \uc2 National polls were charting an unexpected Trump surge. Days after he announced, an NBC-Wall Street Journal poll showed him at just 1 percent, with Bush at 22 percent. A week after the announcement, a Fox News poll put him at 11 percent to Bush's 15 percent. A week after the Phoenix rally, a Post-ABC News poll showed Trump at 24 percent to Bush's 12 percent. Bush would never lead again.\par \par \uc2 Despite the polls, few political strategists took Trump seriously. Nor were candidates seeing a need to fundamentally adapt their strategies. That soon began to change once it became clear that Trump was playing by different rules.\par \par \uc2 The first example came a week after the Arizona rally. At a Family Leader candidate summit in Iowa, Trump disparaged McCain, the party's 2008 nominee and a Vietnam War POW who endured repeated torture.\par \par \uc2 "He's not a war hero," Trump said. With a tone of sarcasm, he continued: "He's a war hero because he was captured? I like people that weren't captured."\par \par \uc2 Denunciations rained down on Trump. Candidates who had declined to criticize him for his immigration pitch suddenly felt emboldened to speak out. Surely, concluded many commentators, the attacks on McCain will bring a swift end to the Trump boomlet.\par \par \uc2 "I think the beginning of the end has come," said Graham, himself a candidate and a close friend of McCain. "The beginning of the end has arrived because he's crossed a line with the American people that will not be tolerated."\par \par \uc2 Graham's feud with Trump had begun even before the McCain attack. Trump's immigration comments, he said, are "going to kill my party." Trump, in retaliation, read aloud Graham's cell phone number at one of his rallies. Graham responded first by changing numbers and then by producing a hilarious video on the many ways to destroy a cellphone.\par \par \uc2 But Trump's surge continued, presenting all the candidates with a dilemma. Should they attack him, in hopes of accelerating what many thought would be an ultimate decline, or should they stay on course and hope that Trump would fade on his own?\par \par \uc2 Bush's advisers telegraphed their theory: Bush would benefit from the amount of attention Trump was getting because he was drowning out the other candidates, including Walker and Rubio, who were positioning themselves to become Bush's main rival.\par \par \uc2 But that assumption was based on the false premise that the Trump candidacy would burn itself out.\par \par \uc2 For Cruz, the anti-establishment senator, the playbook was counterintuitive: praise Trump whenever possible and steer clear of direct engagement. The senator from Texas hoped Trump's supporters would be future Cruz voters, when and if Trump slipped. "I think he's terrific," Cruz said in a Fox News interview at the time.\par \par \uc2 Others hoped that the Trump phenomenon would run its course naturally. "Obviously Donald said things about us and we've had to respond to some of that," said Rubio, who at various points found himself a target of Trump's insults. "But even there we've tried to spend very little time doing that because every second I spend responding to his statement of the day is a second I'm not using to talk to voters about the future of America."\par \par \uc2 Trump's candidacy benefited immensely from the fact that he had spent a decade hosting the NBC television program "The Apprentice." His celebrity appeal, combined with his blunt talk, produced a candidate unlike anything seen in the modern era of politics.\par \par \uc2 "We've never had someone, at least not in my lifetime, who was running for president before who, for the seven or eight years before that, had a top-10 rated national television show," Christie said. "You cannot discount the celebrity factor in all this."\par \par \uc2 Santorum offered a similar analysis: "He's the same as he was on 'The Apprentice.' There is a sense of authenticity even though he's all over the place on issues. .\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09. It's, 'We know that guy.'\u8201\'20\'09"\par \par \uc2 Bush and others jabbed at Trump over immigration in those early weeks, but it was Perry who decided to make a frontal attack. Perry's rhetorical broadside came on July 22 in Washington.\par \par \uc2 "He offers a barking carnival act that can be best described as Trumpism: a toxic mix of demagoguery, mean-spiritedness and nonsense that will lead the Republican Party to perdition if pursued," he said. Perry called Trump's candidacy "a cancer on conservatism and it must be clearly diagnosed, excised and discarded."\par \par \uc2 Many saw Perry's attacks as a move of desperation by a candidate hoping to raise his poll numbers enough to make the main debate stage. Asked recently why he had given the speech, Perry said, "Because it was true, and that's what I felt."\par \par \uc2 AFTER MONTHS OF POSITIONING, the candidates descended on Cleveland to share a debate stage for the first time. There were 17 of them \u8212\'20\'14 so many that they had to be divided into two groups: the top 10 would debate at prime-time; the others in an earlier undercard.\par \par \uc2 The leading candidates were escorted out of their green rooms and into a freight elevator. Together, they rode down to the floor of the Quicken Loans Arena, where the lights were shining bright and the Fox News anchors were made up and ready to start asking questions. Not in recent memory had the party fielded such a deep roster, nor had a primary debate been so hotly anticipated. Then again, a candidate like Donald Trump had never led the polls.\par \par \uc2 In the elevator, the nervous energy was palpable. The presidential aspirants were checking each other out, perhaps thinking that 11 months from that day, only one of them would be returning to this very arena, at the Republican National Convention, to accept the nomination. Matt Borges, the Ohio GOP chairman, made sure to be along for the ride: "Even for a grizzled old advance guy like me, that was a cool moment."\par \par \uc2 For all the takes on what a Trump nomination might portend for the GOP brand or for conservatism itself, most Republicans agreed on what the nuclear scenario would be: Trump running in the general election as an independent. That would so divide conservative voters, they believed, that Clinton would waltz into the White House.\par \par \uc2 The first question tried to settle it once and for all. Co-moderator Bret Baier asked for a show of hands for anyone unwilling to support the eventual nominee and disavow an independent run. Trump, standing center stage, glanced quickly to his right. Not a single hand was in the air. Until he raised his.\par \par \uc2 It was the start of a rollicking night in which Trump landed on the debate stage like a hand grenade, as he had from the day of his announcement.\par \par \uc2 As Kasich later observed, "If I said one of the things he had said about Hispanics, Muslims or women, I'd have to go into a witness protection program."\par \par \uc2 Watching the spectacle unfold, Clinton and her small army of a campaign team saw an opportunity. They would brand the whole GOP field as Trumpian. No matter who the Republicans nominate, they figured, Clinton was running against Trump. "They're Trump without the pizzazz or the hair," Clinton would come to say of the other Republicans.\par \par \uc2 In Washington, Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, was grappling for ways to gain control of his party's nominating process. His carefully laid plans to limit the number of debates and reorganize the calendar after 2012 were challenged by the size of the 2016 field.\par \par \uc2 "For me, it's just 14 candidates, it's having 14 actually varsity-level people running for president," Priebus would later say, after three had dropped out. "Every analysis \u8212\'20\'14 the convention, the delegates, the debates, too many, not enough \u8212\'20\'14 it's the number of candidates to manage and calculate that makes everything else complicated."\par \par \uc2 Even though Trump tongue-lashed party bosses in public, Priebus worked hard to develop a friendly personal rapport with Trump. After the Fox debate, Priebus sought to put the question about a third-party run to bed. He solicited signed pledges from all of the candidates vowing to support the eventual nominee. Most sent theirs back right away. For Trump, however, Priebus trekked up to New York to get the form in person. They met in the candidate's Trump Tower office overlooking Central Park, where the billionaire signed the pledge and gave Priebus his assurances.\par \par \uc2 For the rest of the year, speculation would continue off and on about Trump going rogue. But Priebus wouldn't flinch. "I've never worried about him running as an independent," he said in a December interview. "I am not one tiny, little bit worried about it. He's not doing it."\par \par \uc2 BY NOW, THE TRUMP PHENOMENON was in full bloom. The candidate was reinventing political communication on the fly, calling in by telephone to cable programs day and night, and doing the same with Sunday morning talk shows, in contravention to the long-standing practice of requiring guests at least to be in a remote studio with a camera.\par \par \uc2 Cable television executives knew a hit series when they saw one.\par \par \uc2 The effect on other candidates was smothering. Walker said he quickly came to see that the focus on Trump kept him from breaking through. His policy rollouts, such as a prescription to overhaul the health care law, received scant media coverage.\par \par \uc2 "I remember, one time, I went into a meeting and I came out 50 minutes later, and I won't say what network it was, but it was one of the cable networks, still covering Trump's speech live, 55 minutes later," Walker recalled. "I don't even think the president of the United States gets covered live for 55 minutes."\par \par \uc2 Almost all the candidates were surprised at Trump's continuing support. "We knew that voters were clearly angry at President Obama and wanted significant change in the White House," said Bradshaw, the Bush adviser. "Trump is a talented candidate who channeled their anger effectively. .\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09. Have we been surprised by his staying power? Yes. But has it changed who Jeb is and his belief in the type of candidate we need? No."\par \par \uc2 Beyond the rhetoric, everything about Trump's campaign style drew more attention to the candidacy and perhaps nothing more so than the Boeing 757 that carried him from rally to rally.\par \par \uc2 The plane carried gold-plated glamour along the campaign trail like no other competitor could. Trump invited journalists aboard for news conferences, or local politicians to put the squeeze on them for support. The cream leather chairs, with Trump's crest woven into the headrests, hosted huddles with power brokers such as Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) and fast-food dinners with his staff.\par \par \uc2 Trump, audaciously, landed his helicopter near the legendary Iowa State Fair in August. Just as Clinton was picking up her pork-chop-on-a-stick, sweaty fair-goers looked to the sky at the whirring sound of Trump's helicopter approaching. A political Willy Wonka, sporting his red "Make America Great Again" cap, Trump offered kids rides on his helicopter. "Does anyone want to take a ride?" Trump asked them. "It's nice, right?"\par \par \uc2 Trump continued his penchant for theatrical displays. Ahead of a raucous late-August rally in Mobile, Ala., he directed his pilots to thunder flamboyantly over a college football stadium packed with supporters before touching down. This was the Deep South, the heart of red America, and the unlikely candidate from Queens wanted to own it.\par \par \uc2 Bush's super PAC tried to go toe-to-toe with Trump that day, renting a small airplane to fly over the stadium trailed by a banner that read, "TRUMP 4 TAXES. JEB 4 PREZ."\par \par \uc2 Candidates playing by conventional rules, and with far fewer resources, found themselves at a huge disadvantage. By late summer, they began to fall away.\par \par \uc2 The first was Perry, the Texan who had run again in part to prove he was a better candidate than he had been in 2012. He had done that, but he was hobbled \u8212\'20\'14 more so than he had calculated \u8212\'20\'14 by the debate sponsor's decision to split the field into varsity and JV sessions and particularly by an indictment for misusing his office. "The indictment needed to go away and I needed to be on the main debate stage," he said. "Neither one of those happened."\par \par \uc2 In some ways, Perry became an object lesson for the folly of trying to attack Trump directly. But he also admitted to miscalculations about the state of the Republican electorate. "I've been mad at Washington longer than anybody out there \u8212\'20\'14 and doing something about it," he said, pointing to his record as governor.\par \par \uc2 But it was Trump \u8212\'20\'14 and, at that moment in early September, Carson and Fiorina \u8212\'20\'14 who were reaping the benefits of the anti-Washington anger.\par \par \uc2 "That's my misjudgment," Perry said. He added: "The electorate is really disgusted with Washington and the bullet goes through Washington and hits anybody that's got any experience. They just lump us all into one."\par \par \uc2 Perry's departure came less than a week before the second debate, this one at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library.\par \par \uc2 Backstage or between commercial breaks at the debates, the candidates were collegial with one another. Their personalities in that mix were revealing; one candidate would quip to Priebus that if the \uc2 RNC\uc2  really wanted to raise money it would sell pay-per-view access to the green rooms.\par \par \uc2 Fiorina and Paul were known to be more serious outliers among the group. Rubio came across to some as scripted and Cruz alternated between being a loner and a social butterfly. Kasich occasionally was moody, Christie gregarious and chatty, and Trump particularly charming, endlessly in search of praise.\par \par \uc2 Heading into the Reagan Library debate, Trump knew his tussle with Fiorina might come up. A few days earlier, he was quoted in \uc2 Rolling Stone\uc2  magazine criticizing the appearance of her face: "Can you imagine that, the face of our next president?!"\par \par \uc2 Backstage before the debate, according to a person who observed the candidates and who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the private encounter, "He was really trying to work her." It had little effect on Fiorina, who moments later would score one of her best applause lines with her steely retort to Trump. The debate propelled Fiorina in the polls for a few weeks, though she would not stay in the top tier for long.\par \par \uc2 "There's a myth about Donald," the same person said. "He doesn't like one-on-one confrontation. He likes going on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and taking off at somebody. Or he's in another room and you're 5,000 miles away and he bangs you. But when you're face-to-face, he doesn't like it. He's not comfortable with it. He wants to be liked, and you could tell that backstage."\par \par \uc2 Standing next to Fiorina that night was Walker. For the Wisconsin governor, the debate was a critical opportunity. Over the summer, he had seen his lead in Iowa evaporate, eclipsed by both Trump and Carson. He was in single digits in the state most critical to his hopes of winning the nomination and his campaign was under pressure to reverse the trend.\par \par \uc2 Through much of the evening, Walker was barely visible among the 11 candidates on the stage. After the debate, one of Walker's sons made a telling observation.\par \par \uc2 "Dad, you only got a couple questions because all the questions were about attacks on the other candidates," Walker recalled his son saying. "He said, 'You don't attack any of the other Republicans; of course, you didn't get any questions.'\u8201\'20\'09"\par \par \uc2 Walker's campaign was hobbled by more than the lack of visibility at the Reagan Library debate \u8212\'20\'14 mistakes by the candidate and what turned out to be profligate spending in the face of diminished resources.\par \par \uc2 But like Perry, Walker found that experience in office and a record of taking on fights prized by conservatives provided little boost in the face of the appeals of pure outsiders: "I think because there's frustration, voters have said we're going to go as far removed from that, which again is why you had not only Trump but at least for a while you had Carly and Carson be a part of this wave of interest out there."\par \par \uc2 Within a week of the Reagan Library debate, Walker abruptly suspended his campaign. The decision, he said, came down to answering the question of whether he could make changes that would alter the trajectory of his candidacy. "If we can't change so that we get more attention, then we don't have a pathway to the nomination," he said.\par \par \uc2 When Walker announced his suspension on Sept. 21, he said, "I believe that I am being called to lead by helping to clear the field in this race so that a positive, conservative message can rise to the top of the field. .\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09. I encourage other Republican presidential candidates to consider doing the same."\par \par \uc2 None of the other candidates heeded Walker's advice.\par \par \uc2 AUTUMN GAVE RISE to a few rivalries that would linger into the New Year. Leading up to the Oct. 28 debate in Boulder, Colo., Bush and his team escalated their criticism of Rubio. At a closed-door strategy briefing, Bush's advisers presented to donors a slide show, part of which detailed Rubio's perceived vulnerabilities. They had two take-aways: Rubio has a lot of baggage and his relative inexperience relegated him to a "GOP Obama."\par \par \uc2 On the campaign trail, Bush was zeroing in on Rubio's voting record, noting that he had missed more votes than any of his colleagues. Bush suggested senators who miss their work should have their pay docked. His son, Jeb Jr., played the part of aggrieved constituent: "Dude, you know, either drop out or do something."\par \par \uc2 In their debate preparations, Rubio and his advisers knew what to expect. The moment came 21 minutes into the debate. "Because I am a constituent of the senator," Bush said, scolding his one-time disciple, "I expected that he would do constituent service, which means that he shows up to work."\par \par \uc2 Rubio counterpunched without missing a beat. "The only reason you are doing it now is because we are running for the same position, and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you."\par \par \uc2 In that instant, whatever air was left in Bush's balloon seemed to fizzle out. Reporters in the spin room that night peppered campaign manager Danny Diaz with questions about whether Bush should quit the race.\par \par \uc2 The Bush team continued to believe that if it could convey to voters the candidate's record of successes and reforms in Florida, its candidate would eventually win their support. This had been the focus of the pro-Bush super PAC's fall advertising blitz. But to some voters, what had gotten through was not the Florida record but Trump's incessant and unyielding mocking of Bush as "low energy."\par \par \uc2 With fresh urgency, Bush headed to New Hampshire for a "Jeb Can Fix It" bus tour. He invited reporters onto his luxury coach, where Bush sat on a plush couch musing about his shortcomings.\par \par \uc2 "I've learned to accept the simple fact that I'm imperfect under God's watchful eye," he said one night. "I don't have a self-esteem problem, and I don't have an overstated-worth problem. .\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09. The adversity, I turn into opportunity. It's an obstacle to jump over. It's an opportunity to get better."\par \par \uc2 Bush's fall surprised some almost as much as Trump's rise. "I expected Bush not only to have all the money, but also all the oxygen." Kasich said. "But he just didn't."\par \par \uc2 Rubio, meanwhile, who had struggled all summer to raise money and gain meaningful traction in the polls, seemed set to soar. Soon, donors would sign on and endorsements would roll in. Looking back, Rubio said, "I'm not a big believer in this one pivotal moment that decides the whole race." But if there were such a moment for him, the Boulder brawl was it.\par \par \uc2 The candidate who made the most of the Boulder debate was not Rubio, however. It was Cruz. The debate was a freewheeling and chaotic affair, and the confrontational line of questioning from the CNBC moderators set the candidates on edge. Republican base voters famously scorn the mainstream media, and Cruz pounced on the opportunity to turn on the moderators.\par \par \uc2 "This is not a cage match," Cruz thundered at the debate. "You look at the questions: 'Donald Trump, are you a comic-book villain?' 'Ben Carson, can you do math?' 'John Kasich, will you insult two people over here?' 'Marco Rubio, why don't you resign?' 'Jeb Bush, why have your numbers fallen?'\u8201\'20\'09"\par \par \uc2 The live audience at the \uc2 University of Colorado\uc2  roared in approval. And over on Fox News Channel, the meter on pollster \uc2 Frank Luntz\uc2 's focus group nearly went off the charts. Luntz said on the air, "I've been doing this since 1996. This is a special moment. I've never tested in any primary debate a line that scored as well as this."\par \par \uc2 At the next debate, in Milwaukee on Nov. 10, Cruz would set his sights on Rubio. By the next morning, they had begun sparring over immigration policy, with each accusing the other of having once supported amnesty. Their squabbling would stretch into the new year.\par \par \uc2 Other candidates were left to fume at what they perceived was coverage almost totally dictated by the latest poll \u8212\'20\'14 and not always a reliable poll. Paul was among those most exasperated. His rallies, he said, were still well attended. "The frustrating thing is the lack of appreciation of what we've done," Paul said. "The simplicity of news coverage is astounding, where they'll poll 300 to 400 people, and that defines the story."\par \par \uc2 AS FALL TURNED TO WINTER, outside events conspired to reshape the race. The terrorist attacks Nov. 13 in Paris and Dec. 2 in San Bernardino, Calif., spread fear across the country. More than anything, Republican voters were looking for strength.\par \par \uc2 Carson became an immediate victim. The mild-mannered surgeon hardly fit the profile of a wartime commander in chief. He stammered over foreign policy in interviews. His national security tutors leaked word that he didn't know what he was talking about. And when Carson delivered a high-profile speech to the Republican Jewish Coalition, he repeatedly read "\uc2 Hamas\uc2  " in his speech notes and botched the name of the Palestinian-Islamist movement, pronouncing it as the ground chickpea dish "hummus."\par \par \uc2 Before Paris, Carson had started to surpass Trump in some Iowa and national polls, but with the shift to foreign affairs his poll numbers plummeted. He made a last-ditch effort to arrest his standing, touching down in Jordan just after Thanksgiving to tour two Syrian refugee camps on a fact-finding mission. But it did not have the desired effect.\par \par \uc2 Frustrated, Carson gathered his advisers at his home in West Palm Beach, Fla., to discuss repairing how he was perceived on foreign policy. The downbeat session stretched on for hours, with Carson complaining to aides that he was being portrayed as foolish. "Obviously, going through a process like this is pretty brutal," Carson would later say.\par \par \uc2 At the Dec. 15 debate in Las Vegas, he turned in another underwhelming performance. Soon, his campaign was engulfed in confusion and infighting. Carson didn't know what to do to rescue his fleeting popularity with voters. He invited journalists from The Post and the Associated Press to his home two days before Christmas to signal a staff shake-up. No one's job was safe, he warned.\par \par \uc2 "The key thing for me is just going to be not changing," Carson said. "Everybody wants you to change. They say, 'If you do this, it'll be better.' But that's what politicians do. That's what they try to do in order to get elected. I'm not trying to change in order to get elected."\par \par \uc2 On the last day of the year, campaign manager Bennett and other top officials resigned from the Carson campaign.\par \par \uc2 The Paris and San Bernardino attacks persuaded other candidates that a shift to life-or-death issues of national security would expose Trump as unworldly and unknowledgeable. But once again, he defied the norms of politics.\par \par \uc2 The policy pronouncement came over by email on Dec. 7, Pearl Harbor Day, at 4:16 p.m.: "Donald J. Trump Statement on Preventing Muslim Immigration."\par \par \uc2 Trump called for a "total and complete" ban on Muslims entering the United States, at least temporarily. His statement cited research that he said showed that large segments of the world's fastest-growing religion were rooted in hatred and violence.\par \par \uc2 The proposal defied a call for tolerance toward Muslims that President Obama issued less than 24 hours earlier from the Oval Office. It drew condemnations from leaders around the globe as well as his rival candidates. "Donald Trump is unhinged," Bush tweeted.\par \par \uc2 Finally, Trump had crossed a bridge too far. Or so went the instant analysis \u8212\'20\'14 once again. But that night in South Carolina, campaigning aboard the USS Yorktown, Trump defiantly read his proposal. Banning Muslims was "common sense," he said. "We have no choice. We have no choice."\par \par \uc2 His crowd rose to its feet. There were cheers and hoots and loud applause. In the days to come, Trump's poll numbers climbed higher still. Republican primary voters, it turned out, liked what he had to say.\par \par \uc2 The Muslim comment seemed to spur Bush to action. In the year's final debate, he confronted Trump more vigorously than ever, delivering a performance that seemed to rejuvenate him. He continued to carry the attacks on Trump through the rest of the year with the hope that in the upside-down world of the Republican race, no one was truly out of the running.\par \par \uc2 "This is not something that is new," adviser Bradshaw said of Bush's aggression. "Trump's comments keep getting more outrageous. He felt it was incumbent on him to push back. He [Trump] is not our path to the White House."\par \par \uc2 Bush told \uc2 CBS\uc2  's John Dickerson in late December that he had "hated" being the front-runner and now felt unleashed to run freely. "It is a little liberating to be able to post up against a guy who is not qualified to be president," he said.\par \par \uc2 Bush's candidacy now stood for something else, however, which was the epic failure of super PAC dollars to change the dynamic of the Republican race in 2015. Right to Rise, Bush's super PAC, spent tens of millions of dollars through the fall and early winter months while Bush's poll numbers continued to sag. But no other candidate's super PAC was having any real success, either.\par \par \uc2 On New Year's Eve, Trump took to \uc2 Twitter\uc2  to observe: ".@JebBush has spent $63,000,000 and is at the bottom of the polls. I have spent almost nothing and am at the top. WIN!"\par \par \uc2 No final verdict was possible on the power of the super PAC until the voters were heard from in 2016, but in 2015 they were the dogs that didn't bark.\par \par \uc2 Trump wasn't the only presidential hopeful trying to exude strength after San Bernardino. For Christie, who had toiled for months in relative obscurity searching from one New Hampshire town hall meeting to next for a comeback, terrorism became his lucky strike. Suddenly, the tough, straight-talking former prosecutor from New Jersey was a hot draw.\par \par \uc2 At town hall-style meetings stretching two hours long, grown men and women were reduced to tears as Christie talked about the five hours on Sept. 11, 2001, when he didn't know if his wife, Mary Pat, who worked in Lower Manhattan, had died with the fall of the Twin Towers.\par \par \uc2 Christie also stressed that, as a former U.S. attorney in New Jersey who dealt with issues of terrorism after 9/11, his credentials stood alone. Sitting down for an interview one chilly December night in Wolfeboro, N.H., Christie said: "I personally know all the tools that are available and have used them. No one else on that stage has done that. They've just heard about it from other people. It's the difference between playing in a sport and being a spectator."\par \par \uc2 BY YEAR'S END, THERE WAS a palpable sense of unease about the future \u8212\'20\'14 fear of possible terrorist attacks, distrust of institutions and political leaders, economic anxieties amid the recovery and lower unemployment, and confusion about what verdict the voters would deliver in November.\par \par \uc2 Analysts looked for parallels for the year just ended. Was this like 1992, a year of anger at government when a third-party candidate by the name of Ross Perot captured nearly a fifth of the national vote? Or 1948, with two major-party nominees and independent candidates from the left and right? Or the period in the late 1960s and early 1970s when the racially based rhetoric of George Wallace struck a populist chord?\par \par \uc2 Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster who advises a pro-Clinton super PAC, said: "I think it's unique to our times. It's very much a product of the economic moment, this combination of a world of post-Citizen's United [the Supreme Court case that helped give rise to super PACs] and post-Great Recession. .\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09. I definitely think what we're going through now is deeper and darker than anything we've gone through in our politics for a long time."\par \par \uc2 The Democratic nomination contest still falls along more conventional lines, with a strong front-runner in Clinton backed heavily by the establishment and an insurgent challenger in Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.) powered by an energized progressive base.\par \par \uc2 The real turmoil is inside the Republican Party, now clearly split and heading for a potentially decisive clash between its warring factions.\par \par \uc2 Whatever lies ahead, the assumptions candidates and their strategists carried with them as the year began were mostly blown apart by what happened, including the possibility that Trump could become the Republican nominee. Among Trump supporters, there is a belief that the political class doesn't know what's coming. Party leaders still heavily discount that possibility, but they no longer rule it out.\par \par \uc2 "I'm not one of these people that think that Donald Trump can't win a general election," said Priebus, the RNC chair. "I actually think there is a huge crossover appeal there to people that are disengaged politically that he speaks to. .\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09. Donald Trump taps into the culture. Some people in politics don't get it, don't understand it, are frustrated by it. It doesn't matter. He does."\par \par \uc2 The struggles of the establishment candidates to slow down Trump and Cruz, who by year's end was surging in Iowa, led some party figures to think about a saving grace. In late December in Boston, Romney said he still encounters Republicans trying to draft him. "Every day I get a call or letters," he said. "I go to church, I get harangued at church. 'Oh, you've got to run!'\u8201\'20\'09"\par \par \uc2 "Look," Romney added, "I had one person who was running for president, and I won't give you the name .\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09. called me and said, 'I hope you don't close the door. We may need you.' That's a person running for president. A candidate. A Republican. I'm not giving it a second thought."\par \par \uc2 One other thing has changed: At the time Trump entered the race and began to defy the conventional rules of past campaigns, there was a sense in the camps of some of his rivals that he had created an alternate universe that ran parallel to the more traditional path of politics. It was there to observe but not necessarily understand or manage. Now many have come to see that they all are operating inside that alternate universe.\par \par \uc2 They are trying to adapt as best they can. Rubio's rhetoric is edgier than it was before. Christie has used over-the-top language to attack Congress and especially Obama, whom he described as a "feckless weakling" at the last debate of the year.\par \par \uc2 For someone like Cruz, a terrain defined by anger is a welcome development. His campaign was shaped from the moment he arrived in Washington as one that would find its most fertile ground among those most disaffected with the elites and the Washington establishment.\par \par \uc2 "I'm a big believer in politics that truth will out," Cruz said. "You run as who you are. Indeed, the candidates who often tend to do the worst are those who can't figure out who they are and who run one day as a conservative and one day as a moderate and end up getting the support of neither."\par \par \uc2 For someone like Rubio, the environment has presented unexpected challenges. How does a candidate who built his campaign around a positive and hopeful message navigate a campaign in which fear and anger have become the guiding emotions?\par \par \uc2 Asked why he believed his approach could win the day in such an environment, Rubio said, "We are a hopeful and optimistic people and we have a lot to be optimistic about if we do what needs to be done. So I would say my campaign is realistic but optimistic." But he went on to say this: "I recognize people's frustration and you've got to speak to that. If they don't believe you're in touch with what they're feeling in their lives, there's no way they're going to make you president."\par \par \uc2 By the time 2015 closed, more candidates had quit the race. Jindal exited in mid-November, and Graham and Pataki followed him in December. When he quit, Jindal noted how the environment favored someone like Trump over more traditional candidates. Saying he had tried to offer policy ideas to the voters, he told Fox News anchor Baier, "Given this crazy, unpredictable election season, clearly there wasn't an interest in those policy papers."\par \par \uc2 Candidates far down in the polls hold out hope that the voters will prove to be unpredictable, as ever. "When people ask that question about surprise, they assume we know something about the election," Paul said. "We haven't had an election. We have polls and things, but I don't think we'll know anything until the voting begins."\par \par \uc2 As Kasich said, 2016 "could be a year where things could be absolutely normal because right now they appear abnormal. There's no voting yet."\par \par \uc2 Santorum said Trump's suffocating presence has slowed the normal rhythms of the campaign, in which candidates rise, are exposed to scrutiny and either prosper or lose altitude. "It's more incremental," he said. "They're not getting the attention that leads to a higher spike and leads to a faster decline. Trump has been a depressant factor on this rise and fall, and it's stretched it out."\par \par \uc2 Santorum has been kept in the shadows, but is he frustrated? "Four years ago, I was more frustrated than I am now," he said. "I actually understand this. I understand the fixation [with Trump]. I get that. What I'm waiting to see \u8212\'20\'14 and this is the valuable role Iowa plays in the process \u8212\'20\'14 is whether Iowans who go to caucuses are going to continue on this trek; or are they going to take a step back and say, 'We're going to regress to the norm?'\u8201\'20\'09"\par \par \uc2 As Election Year begins, the answer to that question seems no more predictable than it was last June 16.\par \par \uc2 Dec. 28-30, 2015\par \par \uc2 It's the week after Christmas and the first contests are little more than a month away. In Iowa and New Hampshire, voters brave nasty snow and difficult roads to question the candidates.\par \par \uc2 Chris Christie\uc2  is in Muscatine, Iowa, and goes straight for the serious stuff. Terrorism. ISIS. That shooting at a center for the developmentally disabled in San Bernardino? It could happen anywhere \u8212\'20\'14 and though he doesn't say Muscatine, everyone knows that's what he means. Marco Rubio is 70 miles up the road in Clinton, an aptly named starting point for his "Out With the Old, In With the New" tour of Iowa. The country is heading toward ruin, and this hopeful son of immigrants wants to save it.\par \par \uc2 Ted Cruz is taking a break from Iowa, but he will be back soon enough. Cruz spends the final days of the year at a sprawling Texas ranch huddling with evangelical leaders, some 300 of them. He began 2015 as the candidate of the tea party. Now he is the candidate of evangelicals, too. But \uc2 Mike Huckabee\uc2  isn't letting it go without a fight. The forgotten victor of eight years past is making plans to camp out in Iowa throughout January, some 150 events. He wants to be remembered again. So, too, does Rick Santorum, Iowa's 2012 winner.\par \par \uc2 Jeb Bush has a plan to bounce back. He is at a smokehouse in South Carolina today, again attacking the man \u8211\'20\'13 a cartoon character, in Bush's mind \u8211\'20\'13 who replaced him as the front-runner. But he is haunted once more by the legacy of his brother. When he playfully nicknames the force-of-nature state senator endorsing him "Hurricane Katrina," his listeners cringe.\par \par \uc2 Donald Trump begins the week in New Hampshire. Snow is coming overnight but the gymnasium at the Pennichuck Middle School in Nashua is filled to capacity. Trump delivers an hour-long speech, punctuated by chants from the audience: "U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!"\par \par \uc2 As he closes, Trump tells of a call he says he received from a reporter, a prominent reporter, he says, without offering a name. He says the reporter has told him, "What you've done nobody has ever, ever done. .\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09. You've changed politics as we know it." Trump likes the sound of that, but he knows better. He offers a parting thought \u8212\'20\'14 a reminder that all up to now is merely prelude. "Honestly," he says, "unless I win, it doesn't mean a damn thing to me."\par \par \uc2 dan.balz@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 philip.rucker@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 robert.costa@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 matea.gold@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 David Weigel contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020160104ec1300001\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

And if we don't get it back fast, we're just going to go weaker, weaker and just disintegrate."\par \par \uc2 Once again, he wasn't alone in his bleak outlook.\par \par \uc2 Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson\u160\'00\'A0compared the United States to a patient "in critical condition." \uc2 Sen. Marco Rubio\uc2  of Florida accused President Obama of having "destroyed our military." Former Florida governor Jeb Bush said Obama had created "the most unstable situation we've had since the World War II era." Not to be outdone, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky suggested three times that we're on the brink of World War III.\par \par \uc2 Perhaps the most frightening prediction, though, came from New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who opened his remarks by asking the audience to envision\u160\'00\'A0"the mothers who will take those children tomorrow morning to the bus stop wondering whether their children will arrive back on that bus safe and sound.\par \par \uc2 "We have people across this country who are scared to death," he said.\par \par \uc2 The debate rhetoric quickly\u160\'00\'A0became so fearful\u160\'00\'A0that conservative moderator\u160\'00\'A0Hugh Hewitt \u8212\'20\'14 a man whose book includes the ominous\u160\'00\'A0subtitle "Crushing the Democrats in Every Election and Why Your Life Depends on It" \u8212\'20\'14 felt compelled to stop and\u160\'00\'A0ask whether the candidates wanted to offer something more uplifting.\par \par \uc2 "This will be the debate that Americans talk about at Christmas," he reminded them. "And thus far, in the first 10 minutes, we haven't heard a lot about Ronald Reagan's city on a hill. We've heard a lot about keeping Americans out, or keeping Americans safe and everyone else out. Is this what you want the party to stand for?"\par \par \uc2 So far this campaign, the answer appears to be yes.\par \par \uc2 Hewitt's question about Reagan was no off-the-cuff remark. Led by Trump, this batch of Republican candidates strikes a much different tone than the Gipper, who, even in the midst of the Cold War, focused less on America's enemies than on its own "greatness."\par \par \uc2 Trump, more than any other candidate, has borrowed that term and tried to make it his own. (He used it 41 times in his presidential announcement.) He\u160\'00\'A0frequently\u160\'00\'A0compares himself to Reagan, not only in his evolution from Democrat entertainer to Republican politician but also in his claim to having a grand vision for America.\par \par \uc2 Whereas Reagan's was relentlessly optimistic, though, Trump's promise of "making America great again" is framed largely by\u160\'00\'A0fear.\par \par \uc2 From his\u160\'00\'A0June 16 presidential announcement,\u160\'00\'A0Trump's campaign has gone\u160\'00\'A0negative. Mexican immigrants were "rapists," he claimed. China was "killing us."\par \par \uc2 "The U.S. has become a dumping ground for everybody else's problems," he said.\par \par \uc2 Compare that to Reagan's vision of the country more than half a century ago.\par \par \uc2 "I, in my own mind, have always thought of America as a place in the divine scheme of things that was set aside as a promised land," he said in one his first documented speeches, delivered in Fulton, Mo., in 1952. "It was set here, and the price of admission was very simple: the means of selection was very simple as to how this land should be populated. Any place in the world and any person from those places; any person with the courage, with the desire to tear up their roots, to strive for freedom, to attempt and dare to live in a strange and foreign place, to travel halfway across the world was welcome here."\par \par \uc2 The contrast to\u160\'00\'A0Trump's immigration policy \u8212\'20\'14 including\u160\'00\'A0his call for a ban on Muslims entering the United States \u8212\'20\'14 couldn't be clearer. But it's the rhetoric, the tone,\u160\'00\'A0of the two politicians' speeches that are\u160\'00\'A0even more distinct.\par \par \uc2 From his first campaign for president to his departing remarks from the Oval Office, Reagan likened America to "a shining city on a hill,"\u160\'00\'A0a "beacon" or a "magnet for all who must have freedom, for all the pilgrims from all the lost places who are hurtling through the darkness, toward home."\par \par \uc2 For Trump, America is more of a fortress, with its "winners" surrounded by a "great, great wall"\u160\'00\'A0to keep the "losers" out.\par \par \uc2 "It certainly is curious that Trump aligns himself so much with Reagan, yet is running a campaign that is antagonistic to Reagan's glowing optimism,"\u160\'00\'A0Matt Motyl, a political psychologist\u160\'00\'A0and assistant professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago, told The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 From the day that Reagan erupted onto the national political scene, his speeches were marked by lofty, dreamy rhetoric.\par \par \uc2 "You and I have a rendezvous with destiny," he said during his first televised speech, stumping for Sen. Barry Goldwater of Arizona in the fall of 1964. "We'll preserve for our children this, the last best hope of man on Earth, or we'll sentence them to take the last step into a thousand years of darkness."\par \par \uc2 Many historians credit that optimism with getting Reagan elected.\par \par \uc2 When Reagan\u160\'00\'A0ran for president in 1980, the country was in economic \u8212\'20\'14 and, he argued, spiritual \u8212\'20\'14 recession. Incumbent \uc2 Jimmy Carter\uc2  had tried to fight unemployment by boosting government spending, only to see inflation rise. The 1979 Iranian hostage crisis, and its botched rescue attempt, had raised questions about Carter's decision-making. The era seemed to be encapsulated by a speech that Carter gave in the summer of 1979. Dubbed the "crisis of confidence speech," Carter read letters from American citizens criticizing his administration and worrying about the future. "The erosion of our confidence in the future is threatening to destroy the social and the political fabric of America," the president told the nation.\par \par \uc2 "I cannot promise you everything will be better from this moment forward, that there will be no more sacrifice, because there will," Carter said a year later. "And I will not lie to you and say that all is right in the world, because it's not, or all right in our nation, because it's not."\par \par \uc2 Carter's sober message couldn't compete with Reagan's sunny optimism.\par \par \uc2 Democrats "say that the United States has had its days in the sun, that our nation has passed its zenith," Reagan said when accepting the GOP nomination in July 1980. "My fellow citizens, I utterly reject that view."\par \par \uc2 In his one and only debate with Carter later that year, Reagan cagily implied that America had declined\u160\'00\'A0under the incumbent, but without dwelling on\u160\'00\'A0doom and gloom.\par \par \uc2 "Next Tuesday, all of you will go to the polls," he famously said. "You'll stand there in the polling place and make a decision. I think when you make that decision it might be well if you would ask yourself: Are you better off than you were four years ago?"\par \par \uc2 Although Trump has promised to "bomb the hell out of ISIS," Reagan once said that "no arsenal or no weapon in the arsenals of the world is so formidable as the will and moral courage of free men and women."\par \par \uc2 And although Reagan escalated the Cold War arms race, his\u160\'00\'A0rhetoric, at least, focused more on American resilience and supremacy than the Soviet threat.\par \par \uc2 "The years ahead will be great ones for our country, for the cause of freedom and the spread of civilization," he said shortly after taking office in 1981. "The West will not contain Communism; it will transcend Communism. We will not bother to denounce it; we'll dismiss it as a sad, bizarre chapter in human history whose last pages are even now being written."\par \par \uc2 Reagan earned his title if "The Great Communicator" because he spoke simply yet\u160\'00\'A0evocatively, according to biographer Lou Cannon.\par \par \uc2 "The choices this year are not just between two different personalities or between two political parties," Reagan said during his 1984 reelection campaign. "They're between two different visions of the future, two fundamentally different ways of governing \u8212\'20\'14 their government of pessimism, fear, and limits, or ours of hope, confidence and growth.\par \par \uc2 "He had a gift for optimism," Cannon wrote after Reagan's death. "He always spoke of the future."\par \par \uc2 Despite ordering the invasion of Grenada and arming Iran \u8212\'20\'14 unwittingly, he claimed \u8212\'20\'14 Reagan's vision of America was much less bellicose than the one that Trump has painted on the campaign trail. Even when threatening military action, he seemed subdued.\par \par \uc2 "America is the most peaceful, least warlike nation in modern history. We are not the cause of all the ills of the world. We're a patient and generous people," he said when accepting the GOP nomination again in 1984. "But for the sake of our freedom and that of others, we cannot permit our reserve to be confused with a lack of resolve."\par \par \uc2 Trump appears to have adopted Reagan's American exceptionalism, but he added an apocalyptic twist.\par \par \uc2 "We can't live like this," Trump warned on Dec. 8 as he called for a ban on Muslims. "You're going to have more World Trade Centers. It's going to get worse and worse, folks."\par \par \uc2 "Something bad is happening," he warned a week earlier in a stump speech\u160\'00\'A0casting suspicion on Muslims and mosques. "Something really dangerous is going on."\par \par \uc2 Fortune magazine recently called it Trump's "doomsday rhetoric," pointing out that his language ironically echoes that of the group he has sworn to annihilate: the \uc2 Islamic State\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 After performing an analysis of every word Trump spoke over the course of a week, the \uc2 New York Times\uc2  had another word for\u160\'00\'A0the political firebrand's style of speech: demagoguery.\par \par \uc2 "His entire campaign is run like a demagogue's \u8212\'20\'14 his language of division, his cult of personality, his manner of categorizing and maligning people with a broad brush," Jennifer Mercieca, an expert on political discourse at Texas A&M University, told \uc2 the Times\uc2 . "If you're an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , you're a loser. If you're captured in war, like \uc2 John McCain\uc2 , you're a loser. If you have a disability, you're a loser. It's rhetoric like [George C.] Wallace's \u8212\'20\'14 it's not a kind or generous rhetoric."\par \par \uc2 Reagan's tone could be preachy and moralizing, but it was reassuring. His message\u160\'00\'A0was essentially that with him in charge, we'd be all right.\par \par \uc2 For Trump, it's\u160\'00\'A0much more ominous: Without him\u160\'00\'A0as commander in chief,\u160\'00\'A0we're all in for a "disaster."\par \par \uc2 He has even claimed\u160\'00\'A0that he can "feel" or "predict" when terrorists are about to strike the United States.\u160\'00\'A0"I said Osama bin Laden is going to come and do damage to us," he said. "And nobody believed it."\par \par \uc2 "\uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  appeals to voters' fears by depicting a nation in crisis, while positioning himself as the nation's hero \u8212\'20\'14 the only one who can conquer our foes, secure our borders and 'Make America Great Again,'" Mercieca wrote on The Conversation.\par \par \uc2 Trump's alarmist rhetoric has also pulled\u160\'00\'A0many of his fellow GOP candidates into the same realm.\par \par \uc2 Even Rubio \u8212\'20\'14 the candidate who, with his good looks and ill-fated immigration reform, arguably\u160\'00\'A0most closely resembles Reagan \u8212\'20\'14 has been drawn down the doom-and-gloom debate rabbit hole\u160\'00\'A0by Trump. The senator from Florida has slammed Obama and, at times, his GOP opponents, with increasingly fearful rhetoric.\par \par \uc2 There are risks and rewards to the pessimistic approach.\par \par \uc2 "Speaking in these terrifying terms is unlikely to garner Trump or any of the Republicans much support from moderate voters, but it very likely will motivate their core conservative constituency to turn out and cast their ballots," explained\u160\'00\'A0Motyl, the political psychologist.\par \par \uc2 "Today, presidential campaigns are won and lost not by who persuades more moderate voters to swing to their side, but rather by who can fire up their base and get them to the polls," he said. "President Bush won in 2004 by doing a better job at turning out conservative evangelical voters than Senator Kerry did at turning out working class liberals. President Obama won in 2008 and 2012 by getting liberal Americans and African Americans fired up and ready to go, while Senator McCain and Governor Romney failed to ignite the conservative base the way that Bush did in 2000 and especially 2004. At this stage, it seems clear that the GOP doesn't want to repeat the mistakes they made in choosing fairly moderate candidates in 2008 and 2012."\par \par \uc2 Yet, there is also another risk\u160\'00\'A0to\u160\'00\'A0the frightening\u160\'00\'A0rhetoric\u160\'00\'A0on display so far at the GOP debates, Motyl added.\par \par \uc2 "One element that is going to be tough for the Republicans is that if they are hoping to win by using terrifying imagery and language, they're going to have to continue ramping up the terror for the next 11 months," he said.\par \par \uc2 "That's a long time for people to continually be motivated by fear."\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020151217ebch002p9\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

As the wife, daughter and granddaughter of legal immigrants, I supported the resolution as a matter of public safety. In 2007, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Mexico, Anastacio Sanchez-Miranda, committed a triple homicide in the county. The cost to the taxpayers for the prosecution and conviction of Mr. Sanchez-Miranda was more than $1 million, according to court documents. He will spend the rest of his life in a maximum-security prison, courtesy of taxpayers.\par \par \uc2 Republican presidential candidate \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  and his Virginia campaign chair, Corey A. Stewart, are courageous, strong and intelligent men who are willing to take a stand on the difficult and unpopular issue of illegal immigration. Working together, they will restore the rule of law in our country.\par \par \uc2 Donna Widawski, Fairfax\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020151218ebci008c2\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

Is it the immigration debate? ; The percentage of Hispanics who view race relations as bad surged 16 points in 2015.\b0\par\par\uc2 By Aaron Blake   \par \uc2 495 \uc2 words\par \uc2 18 December 2015\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2015, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Americans view race relations as being worse than at any point in the last 20 years, according to a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll. This much isn't\u160\'00\'A0really a big surprise;\u160\'00\'A0other polls have shown similar trends, and\u160\'00\'A0the deaths of Michael Brown, Eric Garner, Freddie Gray and other black men killed by police since the summer of 2014 are often cited as the logical causes.\par \par \uc2 But take a look at the new numbers, and one trendline stands out a little bit more than others. Blacks and whites have turned pessimistic at about the same clip. But Hispanics, who in recent years have been the least likely to view race relations as "bad," just became significantly more pessimistic.\par \par \uc2 The percentage of Hispanics who view race relations as either "fairly bad" or "very bad" jumped 16 points over the last year, versus seven points apiece for black and whites Americans.\par \par \uc2 Now, this could simply be statistical noise -- Hispanics historically have viewed race relations slightly more positively than blacks, and that remains the case today -- but it's also quite possible that what has turned into a pretty testy debate over immigration could be registering here. The sample size in the new poll (110 Hispanics) means there's a big margin of error, but the 16-point jump is statistically significant.\par \par \uc2 It's hard to say with certainty\u160\'00\'A0without more data. Polls on race relations tend to ask specifically about relations between blacks and whites and not generally, as the NBC/WSJ poll does. These polls also tend\u160\'00\'A0to compare how\u160\'00\'A0blacks and whites view this issue, neglecting to mention Hispanics.\par \par \uc2 But let's not forget that\u160\'00\'A0the Republican front-runner, \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 , has taken a very hard-line immigration stance that includes deporting every \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . He also began his campaign by saying many illegal immigrants from Mexico are rapists and other forms of criminals. And Hispanics have been paying attention; as many as 8 in 10 disapprove of him in recent polls, while only about 1 in 10 approve.\par \par \uc2 Exactly right. Almost no one in GOP was talking self-deport in 2013, now Trump set new baseline as mass-deport. {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://t.co/BMyrRWAZDW"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://t.co/BMyrRWAZDW}}}\par \par \uc2 Other Republicans have been talking tough too, including a back and forth at Tuesday's GOP presidential debate in which Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) and \uc2 Marco Rubio\uc2  (R-Fla.) both attempted to\u160\'00\'A0move away from past support for legalizing or giving a path to citizenship to undocumented immigrants.\par \par \uc2 That debate happened after the poll was completed, but it's symptomatic of a Republican primary debate that has tacked to the right\u160\'00\'A0and focused\u160\'00\'A0much more heavily than expected on matters like deportation and border walls -- all thanks to \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020151218ebci003s9\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 LAS VEGAS \u8212\'20\'14\u160\'00\'A0Donald Trump's debate-eve presidential campaign rally here Monday night grew tense at several points when protesters interrupted his remarks and commotions erupted in the crowd.\par \par \uc2 In some instances, there were chaotic physical confrontations.\par \par \uc2 The first interruption came when a Trump supporter brought on stage was in the midst of explaining how his son was killed by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "That's why we need gun control!" a man in the crowd shouted in protest.\par \par \uc2 Then, a brief tumultuous period ensued, and supporters tried to drown out protests with chants of "Trump! Trump! Trump!"\par \par \uc2 Later, after another disturbance, Trump paused his talk about the campaign to comment on the protests.\par \par \uc2 "Do I hear some noise over there? Yes, I do," Trump said. Then he waved in the direction of the protest and said, "Bye-bye."\par \par \uc2 Trump mocked the media for turning their attention to the protests, a line he regularly uses.\par \par \uc2 "They only turn when there's a protester," Trump said.\par \par \uc2 From the designated media work area, which is surrounded by barricades and which is where the campaign requires reporters to remain during events, altercations within the crowd could be heard.\par \par \uc2 BuzzFeed\uc2  reporter McKay Coppins posted brief videos on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  of security personnel seeking to physically remove individuals who appear to be protesters.\par \par \uc2 In one exchange, several men are seen trying to remove a man on the ground who is yelling.\u160\'00\'A0"Light the m----------r on fire!" another man is heard saying in that video, though it is not completely clear from the footage who is speaking at whom.\par \par \uc2 And about 10 minutes into the Trump rally, this happens. pic.twitter.com/65pXHjsJ3x\par \par \uc2 This is the 5th or 6th scuffle to break out at Trump rally between activists and security (w/ Trump fans cheering) pic.twitter.com/sxL2OnZg2g \u8212\'20\'14 McKay Coppins (@mckaycoppins) December 15, 2015\par \par \uc2 It wasn't clear whether local police, hotel security or other officers were responsible for removing protesters. A campaign spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a question about the matter. \u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Other reporters tweeted videos, pictures and recaps of what they described as tense physical exchanges involving some combination of protesters, Trump supporters and security.\par \par \uc2 Really, really tense crowd in Vegas at Trump rally. Several tussles. pic.twitter.com/HK8JCBXBIh\par \par \uc2 Another protestor, another similar reaction from crowd -- screaming, pointing, one man shoves a protestor towards door. \u8212\'20\'14 Benjy Sarlin (@BenjySarlin) December 15, 2015\par \par \uc2 Trump will stand at the center of the stage Tuesday night at a prime-time televised debate hosted by \uc2 CNN\uc2  and \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , by virtue of his lead in the polls.\par \par \uc2 "We have a big night tomorrow," Trump said.\par \par \uc2 In his remarks, Trump largely revisited the themes he has touched on repeatedly during campaign, including deporting illegal immigrants, having a stronger presence on the global stage and recent polls in which he performed well.\par \par \uc2 "The American Dream is dead," said Trump near the end of his remarks. "But we're going to make it bigger and better and stronger than ever before."\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020151215ebcf00209\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

Why what we call the Paris attackers matters. \b0\par\par\uc2 By Amanda Bennett   \par \uc2 1,343 \uc2 words\par \uc2 25 November 2015\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2015, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Amanda Bennett is a contributing columnist for The Washington Post.\par \par \uc2 The recent\u160\'00\'A0Paris attacks\u160\'00\'A0have\u160\'00\'A0revived a vexing debate: What should the group to which the attackers claimed allegiance be called?\par \par \uc2 Among the more common choices: \uc2 Islamic State\uc2 , IS, ISIS, ISL and \uc2 Daesh\uc2 \u160\'00\'A0(also sometimes spelled \uc2 Daish\uc2 \u160\'00\'A0or Daiish). But the organization calls itself a "caliphate," or "al-Dawla" \u8212\'20\'14 the State. Add in the passion-filled modifiers various Western parties have suggested (French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius: "\uc2 Daesh\uc2  cutthroats"; United Nations General Secretary Ban Ki-Moon: "Un-Islamic Non-State"; \uc2 Egypt's Foreign Ministry\uc2 : terrorists, executioners, assassins, murderers) and you have quite an ideological spectrum to traverse just to talk about them.\par \par \uc2 How we name things is significant, because to name something is to define it, to own its meaning, and to persuade people to see it through the lens the namer wants. The title ISIS chooses for itself shows how it wants to be seen, while monikers that others use reflect how they want the group to be perceived \u8212\'20\'14 often two diametrically opposed positions.\par \par \uc2 "These are important words to parse properly. It's really important to reflect how people see the same events through different prisms," said\u160\'00\'A0Michael Slackman, international managing editor for The New York Times, in an interview. Slackman is charged with helping make some of those calls, and the paper has made the decision to refer to the group as "\uc2 Islamic State\uc2 ."\par \par \uc2 ISIS is the English-translated acronym for al-dowla al-islaamiyya fii-il-i'raaq wa-ash-shaam, or "\uc2 Islamic State in Iraq and Syria\uc2 ." (The actual spelling varies, reflecting the imprecision of rendering the sounds of Arabic words into English.) ISIL or ISL are similar, although the final letter stands for "Levant" referring to a much larger swathe of territory. While people disagree as to its exact boundaries, it's generally understood to encompass at least part or all of Syria, Iraq, Jordan, Israel and Lebanon.\par \par \uc2 What the words actually mean may be less important than what they convey. The name \uc2 Daesh\uc2 \u160\'00\'A0\u8212\'20\'14 which the group itself strongly objects to, even threatening to cut off the tongue of anyone heard using it \u8212\'20\'14 is simply the Romanization of an acronym in Arabic for exactly the same words as underly ISIS. Yet members of the \uc2 Islamic State\uc2  find the term intolerable. Acronyms are unusual in Arabic, meaning that the name sounds like a made-up, and hence illegitimate, word. And when pronounced, \uc2 Daesh\uc2 \u160\'00\'A0just one sound away from an Arabic word that suggests something that "crushes," "tramples," or "sows discord," and is easy to lampoon. It would be as if the acronym for Islamic state were S.H.I.D., writes Alice Guthrie, former Arabic translator-in-residence at the Free Word Centre.\par \par \uc2 Arab state governments and more moderate Muslims reject the word "caliphate" for its implications as much as its meaning. The word literally means a state or territory governed by a caliph, a Muslim leader both spiritual and civil \u8212\'20\'14 much like a Pope and a king all in one. But the word is steeped in Islamic history and suggest a grandeur, validity, and sense of destiny. A caliph's legitimacy is considered to stretch all the way back to the prophet Mohammed, who died in the 7th century. Roughly \u8212\'20\'14 but not exactly \u8212\'20\'14 as if some separatist group in North America claimed to be establishing a religiously-based "kingdom" or "monarchy" in Arizona or Saskatchewan.\par \par \uc2 Governments, journalists and academics are split on word choice.\par \par \uc2 "I understand why political leaders would want to choose [which name to use]," says William McCants, author of The ISIS Apocalypse, published this September, and director of the project on U.S. Relations with the Islamic World at the \uc2 Brookings Institution\uc2 .\u160\'00\'A0"I don't understand the pressure for academics to follow suit. It's one thing for politicians to shape perception. I'm looking for a more neutral way to describe an organization." He notes that in academia, it's usual to call groups what they call themselves.\par \par \uc2 McCants uses the term "\uc2 Islamic State\uc2 " in his book: "It's the one consistent part of their name, which has changed over the years. I chose not to confuse people."\par \par \uc2 Governments are trying to shift the public perception of the group, and win listeners over to their side of the fight.\par \par \uc2 U. S. Secretary of State John Kerry has purposefully used the term \uc2 Daesh\uc2 \u160\'00\'A0in at least one speech, while in his explanation of France's switch to that title, French foreign minister Laurent Fabius said last year that: "This is a terrorist group, and not a state." Ban Ki-Moon issued a similar rejection of the words "Islamic" and "state," saying that the group "[has] nothing to do with Islam, and they certainly do not represent a state." Earlier this year, Egypt's guide for foreign media,\u160\'00\'A0tweeted by a CBS correspondent, suggested strongly negative terms.\par \par \uc2 Journalists largely believe their job is to explain, not persuade.\par \par \uc2 "The name is \uc2 Islamic State\uc2 ," says the \uc2 New York Times\uc2 ' Slackman, noting that this is what the group has designated itself. "Certainly there are many Muslims and non-Muslims alike who find it offensive, but that's their name. We have a pretty straightforward policy here. We use the name that individuals and organizations select for themselves and try to explain it" in context.\par \par \uc2 The Associated Press, whose style guide is widely used by media organizations, tries to select for strict, neutral, accuracy. It suggests the term "\uc2 Islamic State\uc2  group" \u8212\'20\'14 which assigns the body the name it prefers, but appends "group" because "we think it's important to indicate it's not a state by normal criteria," according to Thomas Kent, AP's standards editor.\par \par \uc2 Such a tug of war over a group or movement's name is certainly not the first or even, perhaps, the most complex over such freighted word choices. In the longstanding conflict between Israel and Palestinians, do people "occupy," "annex" or "reclaim" territory? Are Palestinians killed in Arab-Israeli political violence "terrorists" (according to Israel) or "martyrs" (as Palestinian groups assert)? Should the term be "\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 " or "undocumented," or a\u160\'00\'A0third choice that attempts to explain the situation with precision?\par \par \uc2 The AP again favors more neutral choices like "attackers," "gunmen," or "suicide bombers."\u160\'00\'A0"It's best to be specific," Kent says.\par \par \uc2 For some, the choice of terms is simply pragmatic. David Ignatius, a foreign affairs columnist for The Washington Post, calls the group "The \uc2 Islamic State\uc2 " because that's the way the paper's editors, who turn to Associated Press for guidance, largely prefer. (Left to his own devices, Ignatius would call them "ISIS.")\par \par \uc2 Thomas Sanderson\uc2 ,\u160\'00\'A0director of the Transnational Threats Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies,\u160\'00\'A0uses ISIS because it's the name he used originally and because "it rolls off the tongue pretty easily." After all, speakers of Western languages frequently mis-pronounce DA'ESH. (There is a sound in Arabic, called a "voiced pharyngeal fricative" that is\u160\'00\'A0represented by the apostrophe.) "There is really no English equivalent sound, and English speakers often do not hear or recognize this sound, so it tends to disappear in ordinary English transcription of Arabic words," says Karin Ryding, emerita professor of Arab linguistics at Georgetown University.\par \par \uc2 For others, however, the words are less important than what they see happening on the ground. "I can understand why Muslims would resist 'caliphate'. I understand why states would want to deny statehood to the \uc2 Islamic State\uc2 ," says McCants, who also advised the State Department on countering violent extremism. "But they have successfully established a state. It seems odd to argue that you can deny that reality by not naming it as such."\par \par \uc2 The words are hard to choose because they carry with them deeply held beliefs and represent such high stakes: \u160\'00\'A0For the militant groups, it is their very legitimacy. \u160\'00\'A0For Western states, their safety and open societies. \u160\'00\'A0For journalists, the right to stand apart from both.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020151125ebbp00462\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 the-fix\par {\*\bkmkstart toc14}{\*\bkmkend toc14}\b \uc2 5 reasons the 2016 GOP primary is a perfect storm for Donald Trump \b0\par\par\uc2 By Philip Bump   \par \uc2 924 \uc2 words\par \uc2 23 November 2015\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2015, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The anecdotal story of the 2016 Republican nomination contest is that an electorate frustrated with the party establishment is conferring its blessing on candidates with either a complete lack of establishment credentials or ones who've been explicit in denouncing the party. Hence Donald Trump. Hence Ben Carson. Hence Ted Cruz.\par \par \uc2 New data from Pew Research offers some more context for that anecdotal understanding. In some ways, it seems, 2016 is a near-perfect blend of a number of long-standing trends among Republican voters that have led to an early primary process that strongly disadvantages the establishment.\par \par \uc2 1. Republicans are antipathetic to government in general\par \par \uc2 Republicans are generally less enthusiastic about government than Democrats, which probably won't surprise you. On a wide range of issues, Republicans think the government should have a smaller role than Democrats, from access to health care (in which only a third of Republicans think the government should be involved) to strengthening the economy.\par \par \uc2 In general, Republicans think the government does too much.\par \par \uc2 What's more, Republicans are much more likely than Democrats to think that government is too big \u8212\'20\'14 and the gap is widening. In 2004, Republicans were about 25 percentage points more likely to say government was too big. Now, the split is nearly 50 points.\par \par \uc2 2. Trust in government is partisan\par \par \uc2 One of the findings from Pew is that trust in government \u8212\'20\'14 which near a record low \u8212\'20\'14 is subject to partisanship. When a Democrat is in the White House, liberals have more trust in government; when it's a Republican, conservatives do. Below, the gap between liberals and conservatives since 1992.\par \par \uc2 In other words, at the tail end of the second Obama term, conservative trust in government is much lower than it might otherwise be.\par \par \uc2 3. Republicans feel like they've been losing political fights\par \par \uc2 Most Americans think that their political side has been losing more than winning. Two-thirds of people feel that way. But conservatives feel that way . Eighty-one percent of conservatives think that they're losing, versus 44 percent of liberals\u160\'00\'A0\u8212\'20\'14 the only group among which a plurality thinks that they're winning.\par \par \uc2 Clearly, there's overlap between a lot of these attitudes. Having President Obama in the White House will naturally make conservatives less trusting of what the government is doing, and his reelection will naturally make some people feel as though they're losing.\par \par \uc2 But it's likely that the sense of losing among Republicans stems in part from their lower enthusiasm for compromise. Pew's survey that Republicans are still more likely to prefer politicians that stick to their positions than ones who make compromises. Republicans prefer sticking to positions 21 points more than they back compromise; Democrats are about the mirror opposite.\par \par \uc2 4. Republican primary voters overlap with the angriest groups\par \par \uc2 That sense of losing also makes people feel more angry about the government. A quarter of those who feel like they lose more than win were . Only 9 percent of that group was content with the government.\par \par \uc2 Anger at government was also higher among those who to the country and those who are . The Pew survey took place from the end of August to early October of this year, a period during which the leading Republican candidate espoused both a strong anti-\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  position and a pessimism about the current position of the country. There's a bit of a chicken-egg situation in this: e.g., Did enthusiasm for Trump make people more likely to view illegal immigration negatively? But there are clear parallels.\par \par \uc2 There's an operating theory of the Trump dominance, nicely articulated by 538, that it's driven in part by the fact that the Republicans most engaged in the primary process right now are also the most politically active. Indifferent voters will start paying attention closer to Election Day, and they'll weigh in on behalf of the establishment more strongly.\par \par \uc2 Pew's research finds that the most politically engaged Republicans are also those at the government and the most likely to see the government as wasteful and inefficient. Those more-engaged voters are also, definitionally, those who've been paying more attention to the primary.\par \par \uc2 5. Republicans are more likely to think normal people could do a better job than politicians\par \par \uc2 In 1996, a fifth of Republicans viewed government as the "enemy." In 2015, more than a third do \u8212\'20\'14 while the number among Democrats remained the same.\par \par \uc2 Republicans are (perhaps unsurprisingly in light of that) more likely to say that ordinary people could do a better job than politicians at solving problems.\par \par \uc2 Pew weighed favorability for leading Republicans against how angry the voter was. The candidate least popular among angry voters? Jeb Bush, almost certainly the most heavily establishment candidate in the race. Interestingly, \uc2 Marco Rubio\uc2  \u8212\'20\'14 not exactly an outsider \u8212\'20\'14 sees strong favorability from angry voters. Rubio's campaign has hoped to be able to straddle the line between establishment and outsider acceptability, which it seems as though he's managing so far.\par \par \uc2 At least in 2015, before the less-engaged voters start paying attention, that's perhaps about as good as a sitting U.S. senator could do. The Pew data suggests that this is about an ideal moment for a candidate who can articulate a case to the Republican base that they oppose government and, even better, were never a part of it.\par \par \uc2 But: We sort of knew that.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020151123ebbn002bm\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

Alexander   \par \uc2 532 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 November 2015\par \uc2 The Washington Post\par \uc2 WP\par \uc2 FINAL\par B03\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2015, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved   \par \par \uc2 The new team of prosecutors overseeing the retrial of the man charged in the 2001 murder of federal intern Chandra Levy told a D.C. Superior Court judge that their office failed to turn over documents to the defense before the defendant's first trial.\par \par \uc2 On Friday, Assistant U.S. Attorney Deborah Sines said it was a "mistake" by the previous team of prosecutors who handled the case not to hand over all relevant documents to the public defenders who represented Ingmar Guandique, the man charged with Levy's death.\par \par \uc2 As a result, Sines said her team of prosecutors, along with dozens of paralegals, were scrambling to pore through a "mammoth" amount of documents to deliver to Guandique's new attorneys in preparation for the March retrial. The content of those documents was not made clear.\par \par \uc2 It was the first acknowledgment in open court by the government of a failure by prosecutors who handled the initial high-profile trial. Prosecutors are legally required to provide the defense with information that could be favorable to the defendant.\par \par \uc2 Guandique, 34, was convicted of Levy's murder after a 2010 trial and sentenced to 60 years. He was granted a new trial this year after the defense argued that a key witness lied to the jury. Guandique has maintained his innocence and is in prison for attacks on other women.\par \par \uc2 Levy was a 24-year-old intern with the \uc2 Federal Bureau of Prisons\uc2  when she disappeared May 1, 2001. Her remains were found in 2002 in Rock Creek Park. Guandique, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from El Salvador who had pleaded guilty to attacking other women in the park, was charged in 2009.\par \par \uc2 The case gained national attention because police investigators at first looked closely at Gary A. Condit, the married congressman who represented Levy's home town of Modesto, Calif., and who was having an affair with Levy. In the weeks after Levy's disappearance, police investigators searched Condit's apartment and conducted numerous interviews, but they ruled him out as a suspect.\par \par \uc2 In addition to a new team of prosecutors, Guandique also has a new team of public defenders. In documents filed with the court recently, the attorneys said they were considering a strategy for trial in which they would argue that Condit or someone else had a motive to kill Levy. The attorneys requested several dozen pieces of evidence, including phone records from Condit as well as from his wife, Carolyn; police photographs taken during searches of Condit's apartment and vehicles; notes from witnesses who described arguments or disagreements between Condit and Levy; and reports from people who had spotted the two together.\par \par \uc2 During Friday's hearing, one of Guandique's attorneys, Eugene Ohm, petitioned the judge to ensure that prosecutors turn over the evidence in time to prepare for trial.\par \par \uc2 "We believe there is more evidence implicating Mr. Condit that should have been turned over," he said.\par \par \uc2 Separately, Abbe Lowell, Condit's attorney at the time of the Levy investigation, said the details sought by the defense have "no possible relevance" to Levy's disappearance or death.\par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com\par \par \uc2 WP20151121levy1121\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020151121ebbl0002m\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

Alexander   \par \uc2 539 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 November 2015\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2015, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The new team of prosecutors overseeing the retrial of the man charged in the 2001 murder of federal intern Chandra Levy told a D.C. Superior Court judge that their office failed to turn over documents to the defense before the defendant's first trial.\par \par \uc2 On Friday, Assistant U.S. Attorney Deborah Sines said it was a "mistake" by the previous team of prosecutors who handled the case not to hand over all relevant documents to the public defenders who represented Ingmar Guandique, the man charged with Levy's death.\par \par \uc2 As a result, Sines said her team of prosecutors, along with dozens of paralegals, were scrambling to pore through a "mammoth" amount of documents to deliver to Guandique's new attorneys in preparation for the March retrial. The content of those documents was not made clear.\par \par \uc2 It was the first acknowledgment in open court by the government of a failure by prosecutors who handled the initial high-profile trial. Prosecutors are legally required to provide the defense with information that could be favorable to the defendant.\par \par \uc2 Guandique, 34, was convicted of Levy's murder after a 2010 trial and sentenced to 60 years. He was granted a new trial this year after the defense argued that a key witness lied to the jury. Guandique has maintained his innocence and is in prison for attacks on other women.\par \par \uc2 Levy was a 24-year-old intern with the \uc2 Federal Bureau of Prisons\uc2  when she disappeared May 1, 2001. Her remains were found in 2002 in Rock Creek Park. Guandique, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from El Salvador who had pleaded guilty to attacking other women in the park, was charged in 2009.\par \par \uc2 The case gained national attention because police investigators at first looked closely at Gary A. Condit, the married congressman who represented Levy's home town of Modesto, Calif., and who was having an affair with Levy. In the weeks after Levy's disappearance, police investigators searched Condit's apartment and conducted numerous interviews, but they ruled him out as a suspect.\par \par \uc2 In addition to a new team of prosecutors, Guandique also has a new team of public defenders. In documents filed with the court recently, the attorneys said they were considering a strategy for trial in which they would argue that Condit or someone else had a motive to kill Levy. The attorneys requested several dozen pieces of evidence, including phone records from Condit as well as from his wife, Carolyn; police photographs taken during searches of Condit's apartment and vehicles; notes from witnesses who described arguments or disagreements between Condit and Levy; and reports from people who had spotted the two together.\par \par \uc2 During Friday's hearing, one of Guandique's attorneys, Eugene Ohm, petitioned the judge to ensure that prosecutors turn over the evidence in time to prepare for trial.\par \par \uc2 "We believe there is more evidence implicating Mr. Condit that should have been turned over," he said.\par \par \uc2 Separately, Abbe Lowell, Condit's attorney at the time of the Levy investigation, said the details sought by the defense have "no possible relevance" to Levy's disappearance or death.\par \par \uc2 keith.alexander@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020151120ebbk007vf\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

Alexander   \par \uc2 804 \uc2 words\par \uc2 20 November 2015\par \uc2 The Washington Post\par \uc2 WP\par \uc2 FINAL\par B01\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2015, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved   \par \par \uc2 Attorneys for the man accused in the 2001 killing of federal intern Chandra Levy may try to implicate another man: former California congressman Gary A. Condit.\par \par \uc2 As preparation for the March retrial of Ingmar Guandique, defense attorneys have requested phone records from Condit, who was the married congressman with whom Levy had an affair. They asked for photographs taken during searches of Condit's apartment and vehicles, notes from interviews Condit had with authorities, and details about gifts exchanged between Condit and Levy.\par \par \uc2 Guandique's attorneys said in court papers that they "may pursue" a third-party defense at trial, meaning they would try to convince jurors that Condit, or someone else, had motive to kill Levy.\par \par \uc2 Condit, 67, who has returned to private life, did not return calls or messages left for him this week. Abbe Lowell, Condit's attorney at the time of the Levy investigation, said the details sought by the defense have "no possible relevance" to Levy's disappearance or death.\par \par \uc2 "The evidence is so clear that former congressman Condit had nothing to do with the disappearance of Chandra Levy that they may as well be blaming Vladimir Putin," Lowell said.\par \par \uc2 Guandique was previously convicted of Levy's death but was granted a new trial this year after the defense argued that a key witness in the original trial had lied. Guandique has maintained his innocence and is in prison for attacks on other women.\par \par \uc2 A hearing is scheduled for Friday in D.C. Superior Court, where attorneys and prosecutors are expected to discuss the progress as they prepare for the retrial.\par \par \uc2 Levy was a 24-year-old intern with the \uc2 Federal Bureau of Prisons\uc2  when she disappeared May 1, 2001. The case gained national attention because police investigators at first looked closely at Condit, questioning him in the weeks following Levy's disappearance. Authorities later ruled him out as a suspect.\par \par \uc2 Levy's remains were found in 2002 in Rock Creek Park. Guandique, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from El Salvador who had pleaded guilty to attacking other women in the park, was charged in 2009.\par \par \uc2 During a 2010 trial, prosecutors argued that Guandique had a pattern of assaulting women in Rock Creek Park in the months before Levy disappeared. What was perhaps the most critical testimony came from a jailhouse informant who told the jury Guandique had confessed to him while in prison that he killed Levy.\par \par \uc2 Guandique, now 34, was convicted in Levy's death and sentenced to 60 years in prison.\par \par \uc2 Beginning in 2013, Guandique's attorneys with the District's Public Defender Service argued that the former cellmate, Armando Morales, lied on the witness stand. During his testimony, Morales withheld his own previous cooperation with law enforcement as a prison informant.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors eventually dropped their opposition to a defense request for a new trial.\par \par \uc2 In the first trial, Guandique's attorneys did not pursue a third-party defense and primarily focused on arguing against the prosecution's evidence. No eyewitness or forensic evidence linked Guandique to the crime.\par \par \uc2 For the second trial, Guandique has a new team of attorneys from the Public Defender's Service. In its Nov. 9 letter to prosecutors, the team requested about 47 various items, including phone records for Condit and his wife, Carolyn, about the time Levy disappeared; notes from police, FBI and assistant U.S. attorney interviews with Condit; receipts, calendar entries and video surveillance footage involving Condit; and information regarding a two-page confidential document detailing Condit's whereabouts about the time of Levy's disappearance. They asked for notes from witnesses who described any arguments or disagreements between Condit and Levy and reports from people who had spotted the two together.\par \par \uc2 In addition, the defense asked for notes concerning numerous interviews with former legislative aides, friends and associates of Condit's.\par \par \uc2 In an earlier letter, Guandique's attorneys asked prosecutors for information on five people, including Condit, who they termed "potential perpetrators." They include a colleague of Levy's at the Bureau of Prisons. The later request by the defense deals only with Condit.\par \par \uc2 Guandique's attorneys and a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office declined to comment on the requests.\par \par \uc2 Heather Pinckney, a D.C. defense attorney unaffiliated with the case, said Guandique's attorneys may be requesting the Condit material just to help determine their strategy.\par \par \uc2 "They may get the information and decide it's not enough to go third party or to go with Gary Condit. You don't know unless you do the investigation and get the record," Pinckney said. "They may be trying to figure out if a third-party defense is a viable strategy or not. But they need that information to make that determination."\par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com\par \par \uc2 WP20151120levy1120\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020151120ebbk0002e\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

Alexander   \par \uc2 812 \uc2 words\par \uc2 20 November 2015\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2015, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Attorneys for the man accused in the 2001 killing of federal intern Chandra Levy may try to implicate another man: former California congressman Gary A. Condit.\par \par \uc2 As preparation for the March retrial of Ingmar Guandique, defense attorneys have requested phone records from Condit, who was the married congressman with whom Levy had an affair. They asked for photographs taken during searches of Condit's apartment and vehicles, notes from interviews Condit had with authorities, and details about gifts exchanged between Condit and Levy.\par \par \uc2 Guandique's attorneys said in court papers that they "may pursue" a third-party defense at trial, meaning they would try to convince jurors that Condit, or someone else, had motive to kill Levy.\par \par \uc2 Condit, 67, who has returned to private life, did not return calls or messages left for him this week. Abbe Lowell, Condit's attorney at the time of the Levy investigation, said the details sought by the defense have "no possible relevance" to Levy's disappearance or death.\par \par \uc2 "The evidence is so clear that former congressman Condit had nothing to do with the disappearance of Chandra Levy that they may as well be blaming Vladimir Putin," Lowell said.\par \par \uc2 Guandique was previously convicted of Levy's death but was granted a new trial this year after the defense argued that a key witness in the original trial had lied. Guandique has maintained his innocence and is in prison for attacks on other women.\par \par \uc2 A hearing is scheduled for Friday in D.C. Superior Court, where attorneys and prosecutors are expected to discuss the progress as they prepare for the re\u173\'00\'ADtrial.\par \par \uc2 Levy was a 24-year-old intern with the \uc2 Federal Bureau of Prisons\uc2  when she disappeared May 1, 2001. The case gained national attention because police investigators at first looked closely at Condit, questioning him in the weeks following Levy's disappearance. Authorities later ruled him out as a suspect.\par \par \uc2 Levy's remains were found in 2002 in Rock Creek Park. Guandique, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from El Salvador who had pleaded guilty to attacking other women in the park, was charged in 2009.\par \par \uc2 During a 2010 trial, prosecutors argued that Guandique had a pattern of assaulting women in Rock Creek Park in the months before Levy disappeared. What was perhaps the most critical testimony came from a jailhouse informant who told the jury Guandique had confessed to him while in prison that he killed Levy.\par \par \uc2 Guandique, now 34, was convicted in Levy's death and sentenced to 60\u160\'00\'A0years in prison.\par \par \uc2 Beginning in 2013, Guandique's attorneys with the District's Public Defender Service argued that the former cellmate, Armando Morales, lied on the witness stand. During his testimony, Morales withheld his own previous cooperation with law enforcement as a prison informant.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors eventually dropped their opposition to a defense request for a new trial.\par \par \uc2 In the first trial, Guandique's attorneys did not pursue a third-party defense and primarily focused on arguing against the prosecution's evidence. No eyewitness or forensic evidence linked Guandique to the crime.\par \par \uc2 For the second trial, Guandique has a new team of attorneys from the Public Defender's Service. In its Nov.\u160\'00\'A09 letter to prosecutors, the team requested about 47 various items, including phone records for Condit and his wife, Carolyn, about the time Levy disappeared; notes from police, FBI and assistant U.S. attorney interviews with Condit; receipts, calendar entries and video surveillance footage involving Condit; and information regarding a two-page confidential document detailing Condit's whereabouts about the time of Levy's disappearance. They asked for notes from witnesses who described any arguments or disagreements between Condit and Levy and reports from people who had spotted the two together.\par \par \uc2 In addition, the defense asked for notes concerning numerous interviews with former legislative aides, friends and associates of Condit's.\par \par \uc2 In an earlier letter, Guandique's attorneys asked prosecutors for information on five people, including Condit, who they termed "potential perpetrators." They include a colleague of Levy's at the Bureau of Prisons. The later request by the defense deals only with Condit.\par \par \uc2 Guandique's attorneys and a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office declined to comment on the requests.\par \par \uc2 Heather Pinckney, a D.C. defense attorney unaffiliated with the case, said Guandique's attorneys may be requesting the Condit material just to help determine their strategy.\par \par \uc2 "They may get the information and decide it's not enough to go third party or to go with Gary Condit. You don't know unless you do the investigation and get the record," Pinckney said. "They may be trying to figure out if a third-party defense is a viable strategy or not. But they need that information to make that determination."\par \par \uc2 keith.alexander@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020151119ebbj0083q\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Americans\u160\'00\'A0and\u160\'00\'A0many around the world\u160\'00\'A0are feeling a lot less safe Monday morning than they did before the Paris attacks Friday.\u160\'00\'A0And perhaps nobody has been more willing and able to\u160\'00\'A0channel that fear and anxiety to his political benefit\u160\'00\'A0than Donald Trump.\par \par \uc2 In an interview on \uc2 MSNBC\uc2 's "Morning Joe"\u160\'00\'A0on Monday, the GOP front-runner said the United States needs to "watch and study" mosques and that he'd at least entertain the idea of\u160\'00\'A0closing some in\u160\'00\'A0America after the Paris attacks.\par \par \uc2 "Well, I would hate to do it, but it's something that you're going to have to strongly consider because some of the ideas and some of the hatred \u8212\'20\'14 the absolute hatred \u8212\'20\'14 is coming from these areas," he said.\par \par \uc2 In\u160\'00\'A0case he gets blamed for saying something incongruent with\u160\'00\'A0the 1st\u160\'00\'A0Amendment, Trump added that closing mosques is "something that many people \u8212\'20\'14 not me \u8212\'20\'14 it's something that many people are considering and that many people are going to do."\u160\'00\'A0But still, the message from Trump here is clear: The world is a dangerous place, and the only way to stay safe is to elect a president who can protect \u8212\'20\'14 and to a large degree, insulate \u8212\'20\'14 America from it.\par \par \uc2 By playing up many Americans' fears \u8212\'20\'14 about national security, about economic security, about the world in general \u8212\'20\'14 Trump is trying to convince Americans he's just the guy to do that. And while others are certainly paying attention to fears of refugees \u8212\'20\'14 some Republican governors are now closing their borders to them \u8212\'20\'14 Trump has always been willing to take things a step further. The mosques are just the latest example.\par \par \uc2 And\u160\'00\'A0Monday wasn't even the first time he had suggested as a leading presidential candidate that we should maybe close mosques to keep Americans safe.\u160\'00\'A0In an October interview with Fox Business, he said this, according to The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2 's Sarah Pulliam\u160\'00\'A0Bailey:\par \par \uc2 Stuart Varney asked Trump whether, if elected president, would take similar action as the \uc2 British government\uc2 , which has revoked the passports of people of some and closed mosques.\par \par \uc2 Going back to Sept. 11, 2001, \u160\'00\'A0mosques have become a symbol of fear among many\u160\'00\'A0on the right \u8212\'20\'14 a physical manifestation of the fact that there are people in the world who claim to\u160\'00\'A0use a\u160\'00\'A0religious ideology as justification to commit terror against Americans. Some even view them as sanctuaries where attacks could\u160\'00\'A0be plotted.\par \par \uc2 Trump knows this. In 2010, the real estate mogul offered to buy\u160\'00\'A0the the site of a planned Islamic community center\u160\'00\'A0near the fallen World Trade Center \u8212\'20\'14\u160\'00\'A0with the condition that it be\u160\'00\'A0built five blocks away.\par \par \uc2 Talking about mosques in the wake of the Paris attacks is just the latest iteration of this kind of thing from Trump. He has often gone further on these matters than many other in his own party \u8212\'20\'14 and found a devoted base of people who eat it up.\par \par \uc2 In his June presidential launch, Trump\u160\'00\'A0hit a nerve on the right by saying many illegal\u160\'00\'A0Mexican immigrants are rapists and criminals sent by the Mexican government.\par \par \uc2 Then, this summer, when a San Francisco woman was shot and killed, allegedly by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , Trump talked about it repeatedly for a week.\u160\'00\'A0In fact, he's still talking about it: At a rally in\u160\'00\'A0Beaumont, Tex., on Saturday, Trump\u160\'00\'A0brought relatives of people killed by illegal immigrants on stage to share their stories.\par \par \uc2 When Obama announced that the U.S. will take in 10,000 Syrian refugees, Trump said he'd kick them all out when he got to the White House.\u160\'00\'A0Since then, he's used language describing the\u160\'00\'A0millions of refugees from\u160\'00\'A0the Middle East less as if they were people fleeing terrorism and a civil war and more as if they are people traveling to the West to commit terrorism.\par \par \uc2 In September, he wondered aloud\u160\'00\'A0to New Hampshire voters whether\u160\'00\'A0the refugees might be a terrorist army in disguise: "They might be ISIS \u8212\'20\'14 I don't know." He's warned that accepting refugees "could be the greatest Trojan horse."\par \par \uc2 In his speeches, Trump\u160\'00\'A0also exponentially misstates\u160\'00\'A0the number of refugees the U.S. will accept, saying\u160\'00\'A0Obama has opened the U.S. to\u160\'00\'A0250,000 instead of just 10,000. Here's what he said on Saturday,\u160\'00\'A0according to The Post's Jenna Johnson:\par \par \uc2 "And we all have heart, and we all want people taken care of and all of that, but with the problems our country has, to take in 250,000 people \u8212\'20\'14 some of whom are going to have problems, big problems \u8212\'20\'14 is just insane," he said. "You have to be insane. Terrible."\par \par \uc2 Trump isn't backing off his penchant for hyperbole, and he feels no urgency to; he still stands among the top of the polls in the GOP race. And the people\u160\'00\'A0who attended his\u160\'00\'A0Texas rally\u160\'00\'A0the day after Paris sounded incredibly afraid. Bolstering Trump's case and perhaps making his argument more attractive\u160\'00\'A0was news over the weekend that one of the attackers in Paris might have\u160\'00\'A0entered France via the migrant trail.\par \par \uc2 [Conservative suspicions of refugees grow in wake of Paris attacks]\par \par \uc2 Here\u160\'00\'A0are\u160\'00\'A0a few of their comments about Syrian refugees, from Johnson:\par \par \uc2 * "I do not want them here \u8212\'20\'14 we don't know who they are, we don't know their history, we don't know if they're terrorists just being funneled through these other countries."\par \par \uc2 * "I think they're wolves in sheeps' clothing."\par \par \uc2 * "I don't mind taking refugees who are Christian, but the Muslims scare me."\par \par \uc2 Trump's refugees-might-be-dangerous lines have picked up so much momentum that President Obama felt compelled to push back against them in\u160\'00\'A0a news\u160\'00\'A0conference\u160\'00\'A0at the G-20 summit Monday in Turkey. While not mentioning Trump by name, Obama\u160\'00\'A0said, "Many of these refugees are the victims of terrorism themselves. ... Slamming the door in their faces would be a betrayal of our\u160\'00\'A0values."\par \par \uc2 In\u160\'00\'A0Trump's "Morning Joe" interview Monday, host Mika Brzezinski asked Trump whether\u160\'00\'A0even suggesting closing mosques in America wouldn't contribute to anti-Muslim hatred that might be\u160\'00\'A0stewing after the Paris attacks.\par \par \uc2 "There's already hatred," he replied. "The hatred is incredible."\par \par \uc2 As is the fear back home. And Trump knows that.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020151116ebbg005el\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

'One person, one vote' could make things worse. ; A decision to base voter districting on citizenship would make creating a path to citizenship much less appealing to the Republican base.\b0\par\par\uc2 By Aaron Blake   \par \uc2 809 \uc2 words\par \uc2 26 October 2015\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2015, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Each week, In Theory \u160\'00\'A0takes on a big idea in the news and explores it from a range of perspectives. This week we're talking about "one person, one vote." Need a primer? Catch up here.\par \par \uc2 When it comes to running for Congress, not all candidates need the same number of votes to win.\par \par \uc2 According to data from the \uc2 Pew Research Center\uc2 , one member of Congress \u8212\'20\'14 Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard (D-Calif.) \u8212\'20\'14 represents the district with the fewest number of eligible voters, at about 300,000. At the other end of the spectrum, Rep. Peter DeFazio (D-Ore.), represents more than twice that number.\par \par \uc2 There are a number of reasons for this disparity. But the one very much at issue as the Supreme Court nears a decision on Evenwel v. Abbott is that Roybal-Allard's district and many like it include large numbers of undocumented immigrants, who are nevertheless counted by those drawing the districts.\par \par \uc2 A 2006 study conducted by the pro-immigrant rights Immigration Policy Center found that one congressional district in Arizona was one-quarter undocumented immigrants. Roybal-Allard's district, which has since been redrawn, had one of the highest \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  populations at 15 percent, or more than 100,000 in total.\par \par \uc2 [Other perspectives: Why Texas is wrong in the 'one person, one vote' case]\par \par \uc2 All of which is to say: If the Supreme Court changes current practice and rules that "one person, one vote" means that districts must be drawn according to the number of resident citizens rather than total population, it could have a significant impact on how our districts are drawn, and thus on the balance of power in Congress.\par \par \uc2 Determining how this would break down along partisan lines is difficult to say with certainty. But it's safe to guess that the states losing districts would mostly be blue, and the districts that would need to take in more territory to gain citizens would overwhelmingly be those held by Democrats. This would mean fewer liberal districts overall, giving more power to more rural, conservative and Republican territories.\par \par \uc2 Consequently, it might make comprehensive immigration reform an even more elusive goal.\par \par \uc2 Conservative commentators have argued for years that a new pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants \u8212\'20\'14 a linchpin of comprehensive immigration reform \u8212\'20\'14 would hurt the \uc2 Republican Party\uc2  by newly enfranchising millions of voters who would be likely to vote Democrat, given that Latinos (who make up a large proportion of these immigrants) lean increasingly and overwhelmingly Democratic.\par \par \uc2 A second argument against comprehensive reform emerges from the Evenwel case. If the Supreme Court were to change the standard for "one person, one vote" to mean that only citizens should be represented, it would give the GOP a new-found advantage in the drawing of districts. However, allowing undocumented immigrants to become citizens would (eventually, at least) negate the GOP's advantage by adding Democrat-leaning immigrants to the voter rolls and re-adding their population totals the redistricting process.\par \par \uc2 That first argument against the pathway to citizenship \u8212\'20\'14 the one that is already widely espoused \u8212\'20\'14 is, of course, the more compelling and easily explained of the two. Yet if Evenwel is upheld, its potential downsides won't make the GOP any more likely to suddenly warm to the idea of comprehensive immigration reform.\par \par \uc2 It's not exactly something that the vast majority of GOP voters will instantly pick up on. But for those in the party who think it needs to get right with Latinos and pass comprehensive reform (as opposed to its base, which is staunchly opposed to anything that could be construed as "amnesty"), a new ruling on "one person, one vote" may end up being another practical reason to avoid action on a reform that is already unlikely to occur.\par \par \uc2 Correction: This post originally suggested states with high numbers of illegal immigrants could lost districts if these immigrants weren't included under "one person one vote." While the drawing of districts would indeed change, the Constitution clearly requires the apportionment of districts to each state by the number of total people, including immigrants. This section had been removed from the post.\par \par \uc2 Explore these other perspectives:\par \par \uc2 Nathaniel Persily:\u160\'00\'A0'One person, one vote' isn't broken, and the Supreme Court shouldn't fix it\par \par \uc2 Ilya Shapiro:\u160\'00\'A0Why Texas is wrong in the 'one person, one vote' case\par \par \uc2 Nina Perales: The Supreme Court should seize the chance to strike down voter discrimination\par \par \uc2 Richard Pildes:\u160\'00\'A0'Equal representation' should include non-citizens\par \par \uc2 Peter Morrison:\u160\'00\'A0We have the data to make voting fair.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Senate Democrats blocked legislation Tuesday that would crack down on local governments that refuse to fully cooperate with federal immigration authorities in order to protect illegal immigrants from deportation.\par \par \uc2 The bill targeting so-called "sanctuary cities" failed in a 54\u160\'00\'A0to 45\u160\'00\'A0procedural vote. Sixty votes were necessary to advance the bill, which would block such jurisdictions from collecting some federal grants and would toughen criminal sentences for illegal immigrants who are convicted of a serious crime after being repeatedly deported.\par \par \uc2 The House approved a similar bill in July, weeks after an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  allegedly shot and killed 32-year-old Kate Steinle on a San Francisco pier, touching off a national firestorm about the immigration policies of that city and others like it who argue that threats of deportation make it harder to police immigrant communities.\par \par \uc2 [House votes to strip federal funding from 'sanctuary cities']\par \par \uc2 Steinle's death continues to reverberate on Capitol Hill.\par \par \uc2 "The city of San Francisco is proudly a sanctuary city. They say to illegal immigrants across the country and across the world, 'Come to San Francisco. We will protect you from federal immigration laws,'" Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) said Tuesday on the Senate floor. "These policies are inexcusable."\par \par \uc2 [Sign up for The Daily 202, The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2 's new political tipsheet]\par \par \uc2 Democrats denounced the legislation as a pander to the Republican base that does nothing to solve the nation's larger immigration problems. Senate Minority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) called it the "\uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  Act" in a reference to the GOP presidential front-runner, who has called for a crackdown on illegal immigration. Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) on Tuesday said the bill is part of a "stubborn, relentless and shameful assault against immigrants."\par \par \uc2 "We've hit a new low with the extraordinarily hateful rhetoric that diminishes immigrants' contributions to American history and particularly demonizes the Latino community by labeling Mexican immigrants as rapists and criminals," Menendez said.\par \par \uc2 The Senate bill was authored by Sen. David Vitter (R-La.), who is on the ballot for governor Saturday in Louisiana and is likely to face a runoff election later this fall against a Democrat. The bill has been stuck in committee due to a Republican divide over provisions that would toughen criminal sentences, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) decided\u160\'00\'A0to bring the bill to the Senate floor in a move widely interpreted as a bid to help Vitter's campaign.\par \par \uc2 [The Daily 202: Sanctuary cities show vote is pre-election gift from Mitch McConnell to David Vitter]\par \par \uc2 Two Democrats \u8212\'20\'14 Joe Donnelly (Ind.) and Joe Manchin III (W.Va.) \u8212\'20\'14 voted to advance the bill; one Republican, Mark Kirk (Ill.), was opposed. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) was campaigning for president and did not vote Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 Tuesday's vote might not mean the end for the legislation in the current Congress \u8212\'20\'14 especially with another year's worth of presidential campaigning ahead. Cruz, who is running for president, on Tuesday called on Republican leaders to attach the provisions of Vitter's bill to must-pass legislation, adding them to a long list of issues that could play into coming showdowns between congressional Republicans and President Obama.\par \par \uc2 "The next step is not simply to have a vote," Cruz said. "The next step is to attach this legislation to must-pass legislation and to actually fix this problem."\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020151020ebak006el\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 It's easy to forget, but it's true: There's a Democratic campaign for president. The best efforts of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and former Maryland governor Martin O'Malley have only occasionally succeeded in making that race about ideology. Mostly, it's been about e-mails, servers and whether Vice President Biden feels like running yet.\par \par \uc2 This is not what the party's base really cares about. Sanders's wonkish, crowded rallies have been full of policy; so have Hillary Rodham Clinton's events, before the news conferences that turned\u160\'00\'A0inevitably on what she did with her e-mails. The Democratic voters tuning in tonight are going to be listening for specific promises about progressive issues (or fears) that have not often cut through the Trump-colored\u160\'00\'A0media haze. Here is a bluffer's guide.\par \par \uc2 Glass-Steagall: Shorthand for the provisions of the 1933 Banking Act that prevented financial institutions from acting as both commercial and investment banks. Named for Sen. Carter Glass of Virginia and Rep. Henry B. Steagall of Alabama, who'd proposed the legislation at the height of the Great Depression, it became law under President Franklin D. Roosevelt \u8212\'20\'14 and more importantly, was undone in the final years of \uc2 Bill Clinton\uc2 's presidency. To call for "reinstating Glass-Steagall" is to say that then-President Clinton made a blunder that enabled the banker chicanery that led to the 2008 financial crisis.\par \par \uc2 The undocumented: The preferred Democratic term for people who enter the United States illegally. ("\uc2 Illegal immigrant\uc2 " is considered a pejorative at this point.)\par \par \uc2 "Dreamers:" People whose parents brought them to the United States as children, and who therefore lack citizenship. The Dream Act (an acronym for "Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors") is a bill crafted to address the situation.\par \par \uc2 The 99 percent: A concept (and actual piece of data) that grew out of the Occupy Wall Street movement, referring specifically to households that make under $350,000 or so per year -- an income group that constitutes more than 99 percent of the U.S. population.\par \par \uc2 Carbon pricing: The taxing of CO2 emissions, a goal of green groups. A bill got through the Democratic House in the first years of the Obama presidency but has been doomed since. Favored by every Democratic candidate, opposed with the heat of a thousand suns by the energy industry.\par \par \uc2 No-fly zone: Controlling a country's airspace with American (or allied) air power, a way of intervening in a conflict without sending ground troops. As secretary of state, Clinton backed a no-fly zone over Libya; as a candidate she has backed the same idea for Syria. Her rivals have not.\par \par \uc2 TPP: The Trans-Pacific Partnership, a long-in-the-negotiating trade deal between the United States and Pacific nations which \u8212\'20\'14 as of last week \u8212\'20\'14 the major Democrats all oppose. They join most labor unions and progressive Democrats, whose objections include the secrecy of the negotiation process. Members of Congress, for example, can only read the legislation by entering a secluded room, unable to take out anything they get.\par \par \uc2 Single payer: Shorthand for government-run health care. Sanders has always favored replacing America's mixed-market system with something closer to Canada's or those found in the nations of Western Europe, and "single payer" has been the quick way to describe that.\par \par \uc2 Cadillac tax: A looming fee on top-end health-care plans, scheduled to begin in 2018. Sanders and former Sen. Jim Webb (Va.) voted for it, when voting for the entire Affordable Care Act; Sanders has introduced legislation to undo it.\par \par \uc2 Gun show loophole/Charleston loophole: Respectfully, the popular terms for the ability of sellers online and at gun shows to move product without background checks, and the ability of someone with a felony record to obtain a gun if the seller doesn't complete a background check in three days.\par \par \uc2 Citizens United\uc2 : Specifically a reference to the 2010 Supreme Court case \uc2 Citizens United\uc2  v. \uc2 Federal Election Commission\uc2 , but often a metonym for "bad campaign finance decisions" or "corporations dominating our democracy." Sanders has said, repeatedly, that anyone he nominates to the Supreme Court first would have to agree to undo \uc2 Citizens United\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Shelby County: Shelby County v. Holder (2013), the Roberts Supreme Court decision that declared unconstitutional a provision of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The ruling liberated some states and counties with histories of discrimination from having to pre-clear their voting laws with the Justice Department.\par \par \uc2 Sentencing disparities: The gulf between penalties dealt to black men and other Americans, as well as the de jure discrepancies between possessions of different drugs. Every Democrat now favors reducing or ending all of this, but \uc2 Bill Clinton\uc2 's campaign and presidency advanced tough-on-crime policies that every Democrat now wants to undo.\par \par \uc2 Paid family leave: The idea of expanding the current Family and Medical Leave Act; expanding Social Security to require payment, not just time off, for new mothers. Clinton once called it politically unlikely; since 2014, she has consistently backed it. "If we give parents the flexibility on the job and paid family leave it actually helps productivity, which in turn helps all of us," she said then.\par \par \uc2 Living wage: The amount of money it takes for someone to live above the poverty line. It changes between jurisdictions, sometimes dramatically, and Sanders and Clinton have disagreed over whether minimum wages could be raised to $15 per hour nationally or whether states and cities should decide what works for them.\par \par \uc2 ENDA: The Employment Non-Discrimination Act, Democratic legislation that would protect gender identity and sexual orientation from employer bias. Introduced in almost every Congress since 1995, it has been a nonstarter since Republicans took the House of Representatives.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020151013ebad0063h\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The Oct.\u160\'00\'A06 editorial "The war on birthright babies" misstated the 14th Amendment, which says, "All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States. .\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09." The crucial phrase, omitted in the editorial, is "and subject to the jurisdiction thereof." That phrase means that it is not sufficient for the baby to simply be born in the United States for the baby to be a U.S. citizen. The baby must also be "subject to the jurisdiction thereof." Testimony of those who wrote the amendment shows that this phrase meant having sole allegiance to the United States. A baby, obviously incapable of pledging allegiance to anything, is presumed to have allegiance to the parents' country. Therefore, the 14th Amendment properly understood does not confer U.S. citizenship on babies born in the United States to foreign parents.\par \par \uc2 The editorial also said that Texas, in refusing birth certificates to babies born to \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  parents, is making the babies "stateless non-persons, devoid of rights and privileges." This is patently absurd. Babies born abroad to U.S. citizens are U.S. citizens. They are not "stateless non-persons." Other countries recognize babies born abroad to citizens of that country to be citizens of the parents' country. Furthermore, all persons within the borders of the United States are entitled to certain rights and privileges whether they are citizens or not and whether they have a birth certificate or not.\par \par \uc2 Jay R.

Moyer   \par \uc2 1,185 \uc2 words\par \uc2 19 September 2015\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2015, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 CJ Pearson's recent \uc2 YouTube\uc2  video criticizing President Obama.\par \par \uc2 Earlier this week, a 13-year-old kid named \uc2 Coreco\uc2  JaQuan Pearson sat down in front of a camera in the kitchen of his home in Grovetown, Ga. CJ had a lot on his mind: the 14-year-old Muslim student invited to the White House after he was wrongly arrested for building a clock thought to be\u160\'00\'A0a bomb; the young woman allegedly shot by an undocumented immigrant in San Francisco; the four Marines gunned down in Chattanooga over the summer; the Black Lives Matter movement.\par \par \uc2 President Obama, CJ feared, didn't have his White House in order. It was a lot to distill into a short message \u8212\'20\'14 one that would catch fire\u160\'00\'A0among CJ's\u160\'00\'A035,000 \uc2 Twitter\uc2  followers\u160\'00\'A0and large \uc2 YouTube\uc2  audience.\u160\'00\'A0But CJ was determined to make this quick \u8212\'20\'14 and needed little more than two minutes to make his point.\par \par \uc2 "Mr. President," he began, speaking with a Southern twang. "When Kate\u160\'00\'A0Steinle was gunned down by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , you didn't do anything. You didn't even call the family. You didn't invite them to the White House. Is that okay? I don't think so, Mr. President."\par \par \uc2 Twenty seconds had gone by \u8212\'20\'14 but CJ was just getting warmed up.\par \par \uc2 "When cops are being gunned down, you\u160\'00\'A0don't invite their family to the White House," he said. "You never did."\par \par \uc2 This was just the set-up. Then came the punch.\par \par \uc2 "When a Muslim kid builds a clock?" CJ said. "Well, come on by. What is this world that you are living in?"\par \par \uc2 As smoothly as a seasoned\u160\'00\'A0commentator\u160\'00\'A0three or four times his age, CJ then pivoted. He pointed out that it took Obama longer to lower the White House flags to half-staff than it did to light 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. with rainbow colors after the Supreme Court decision legalizing gay marriage. He blamed Obama for the immigration policies that allowed Steinle's killer in the country. He blamed Obama for rules that prevented Marines from carrying their own firearms in Chattanooga. He said Obama was trying to appease "domestic terrorists" \u8212\'20\'14 that is,\u160\'00\'A0Black Lives Matters protesters.\par \par \uc2 "Mr. President, what are your priorities here?" he said. "Because in all honesty, I think you're being ignorant, I think you're incompetent, and I don't think you understand reality."\par \par \uc2 CJ's conclusion: "You don't get invited to the White House for building a clock."\par \par \uc2 As is probably apparent, CJ is not the average teenager. He is not the average \uc2 YouTube\uc2  sensation. And he is not the average conservative. He's just a really passionate young man who really thinks that Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex) should be president.\par \par \uc2 And, of course, CJ is African American \u8212\'20\'14 indeed, the national chairman of Teens for Ted, a national group backing\u160\'00\'A0a candidate who enjoys only\u160\'00\'A0marginal support among black voters.\par \par \uc2 "I strongly believe that Senator Cruz is truly what America needs to make America the shining city on a hill it once was," CJ\u160\'00\'A0wrote in an e-mail to The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2 , saying Cruz would challenge the "Washington cartel." "To allude to the Hunger Games, he's the face of the rebellion. Being a teenager, I am\u160\'00\'A0definitely\u160\'00\'A0a\u160\'00\'A0big fan of that haha!"\par \par \uc2 CJ's video missives have had him in the news at least since he was 12. He said he was suspended from \uc2 Facebook\uc2  after making another video critical of Obama. (\uc2 Facebook\uc2  said children under 13 are not permitted to have accounts, which CJ called "complete malarkey.") And earlier this year, he reportedly sued a liberal activist he claimed threatened him.\par \par \uc2 His videos have gone viral in conservative circles, where commentators and media accounts again and again cite CJ's race.\par \par \uc2 CJ also reports getting criticized for his positions on account of his race.\u160\'00\'A0"I was completely appalled to receive a message on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  saying that it's 'not okay for blacks to support Ted Cruz' and that if I do, I'm a 'self hating Uncle Tom' " he recently wrote. According to this particular gentlemen, it's not okay for blacks to hold different political views. It's not okay for blacks to think for themselves."\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 CJ gets attention.\par \par \uc2 "The Internet allows really anyone to have a voice and build a following, and CJ is a great example," Cruz campaign spokesman Rick Tyler told the Dallas Morning News. "He can make a real difference. He's kind of the model that we want others to follow."\par \par \uc2 CJ lives in Grovetown with his grandparents \u8212\'20\'14 though he says his parents are "actively involved." His grandfather, he said, is a retired First Sergeant of the Army who works at the Department of Energy. Coming from a military family is what inspired CJ to go into politics in the first place.\par \par \uc2 This was in 2008, when he was in second grade.\par \par \uc2 "Senator McCain's life story resonated with me and I was honored to support a man who was willing to give it all up, including his life, while serving his country in the Vietnam War," he wrote.\par \par \uc2 CJ pointed \uc2 YouTube\uc2  rants against, among many other targets, gun control, Hillary Clinton and George Takei, are issued\u160\'00\'A0when he's not doing time in the eighth grade\u160\'00\'A0at Columbia Middle School. He\u160\'00\'A0wasn't the only one on the right criticizing the invite Obama extended to clock-maker\u160\'00\'A0Ahmed Mohamed. Bristol Palin, for example, got in on the act. So did Pamela Geller\u160\'00\'A0\u8212\'20\'14 she of the "prophet Muhammad cartoon contest."\par \par \uc2 "This whole thing smells like a setup," Geller wrote at Breitbart. "With ISIS in America, and young moderate Muslims fleeing to Syria to join the terror group, the response of MacArthur High School officials was rational and reasonable."\par \par \uc2 But CJ was perhaps the youngest to criticize Obama's invitation\u160\'00\'A0\u8212\'20\'14 and almost certainly the only one who appeared on Fox News before he was a teenager.\par \par \uc2 "I think I'm one of the few voices who has taken such a public stand condemning this decision, but I do believe many people agree with the sentiment I expressed in my video," Pearson wrote. "Ahmed is being used as a political prop, and to be quite frank, it's quite disgusting. It's even more disgusting that he's enjoying it."\par \par \uc2 This point raised an uncomfortable comparison. If Ahmed \u8212\'20\'14 a young man of color embraced by the White House for its own reasons \u8212\'20\'14 is a political prop, isn't CJ?\par \par \uc2 "Not at all," CJ wrote. "At the end of the day, I'm not beholden to the \uc2 Republican Party\uc2 . They don't own me and they never will. My political involvement is based on fighting for the conservative principles I believe in and fighting for the future of my generation."\par \par \uc2 He added: "I'm not in it for the fame. I'm not in it for the fortune. I'm involved in politics because I strongly believe my generation deserves a voice."\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020150918eb9i001uq\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

And revolting.\b0\par\par\uc2 By Stephen Stromberg   \par \uc2 474 \uc2 words\par \uc2 16 September 2015\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2015, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) released a TV ad before Wednesday's Republican presidential debate that, for political junkies, evokes Ronald Reagan's 1984 spot, " The Bear ." For everyone else, it's not so clear what Cruz's threatening imagery is supposed to communicate, making it an effective dog whistle \u8212\'20\'14 the technique by which candidates use relatively innocuous language to excite xenophobia, identity-based anger or otherwise unattractive passions.\par \par \uc2 "There's a scorpion in the desert," a narrator says, as the video depicts a venomous arachnid with pincers and stinger crawling across a rocky, rust-colored landscape. "For most of us, its venom is a clear and deadly threat." Whose venom? Which desert? It is the \uc2 Islamic State\uc2 ? Iran? Syrian asylum-seekers? Illegal immigrants from Latin America?\par \par \uc2 "But others refuse to even speak its name." The ad seems to be talking about terrorism here but doesn't\u160\'00\'A0actually say so. Reagan's bear was an obvious reference to Russia; Cruz's scorpion isn't an obvious reference to anything. Its name could be "radical Islamic terrorism." It could also be "anchor babies."\par \par \uc2 "Since the scorpion seeks our destruction, isn't it time we recognize the scorpion for what it is, before it strikes again?" But, really, "it" is\u160\'00\'A0terrorists in Syria and Iraq, here, right? Not the few thousand thoroughly screened Syrian refugees the Obama administration wants to accept? And definitely not Mexicans?\par \par \uc2 Maybe it's not a literal desert, just like it's not a literal scorpion. So maybe it's literally anything ?\par \par \uc2 At this point, a pair of human legs in ostrich-skin cowboy boots appears on screen, confronting the scorpion, which backs off slowly. A picture of Cruz flashes onto the screen next to the words, "Leadership you can trust to protect America." End of ad.\par \par \uc2 The message is that you must be afraid of a threat that some people don't want to identify, as long as that threat\u160\'00\'A0could plausibly be represented by a scorpion in the virtually limitless world of metaphor, and that Ted Cruz is going stand up to it, whatever it may be. Cruz, of course, doesn't have to own any of the more objectionable interpretations viewers might have. After all, he's just copying Reagan's Cold War-era "Bear" ad. But he can benefit from the anti-\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 \u160\'00\'A0bile of, say, the Donald Trump supporters he's been courting, nonetheless. Even if the ad is mostly taken to be about terrorism, which is what sophisticated observers are supposed to conclude, it could easily feed into the heartless panic of those who want to turn away desperate refugees escaping Syria's horrifying civil war out of fear that a terrorist might slip through.\par \par \uc2 Clever, Senator. And revolting.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020150916eb9g0063i\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

We annotate.\b0\par\par\uc2 By Chris Cillizza   \par \uc2 8,058 \uc2 words\par \uc2 2 September 2015\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2015, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  did a phone interview -- natch -- on Tuesday night with one of his preferred TV hosts: \uc2 CNN\uc2  's Don Lemon. Amid the media maelstrom that Trump creates every day via his various interviews, tweets and Instagrams, it's easy to lose your sense of wonder at what he says and how he says it. \u160\'00\'A0I vow to never lose that wonder -- especially since Trump also happens to be the Republican presidential frontrunner at the moment. So, I am regularly annotating Trump's interview using Genius, my new favorite tool on the Internet. You can join in the fun -- annotate along with me!\par \par \uc2 DON LEMON, \uc2 CNN\uc2  TONIGHT SHOW HOST: Breaking news, \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  , one- on-one, right here. This is \uc2 CNN\uc2  Tonight. I'm Don Lemon. And this is \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  . No holds barred. An exclusive.\par \par \uc2 As summer turns to fall and the heats up in earnest, the front runner is firmly in the lead in every national poll, including wide margins in two brand new online polls out today. One shows him topping the field at 29 percent. What is his path to victory?\par \par \uc2 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\par \par \uc2 DONALD TRUMP\uc2  , U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We're going to fight in Massachusetts, and in New Hampshire and we're going to fight in Iowa, and we're going to fight in, I'll tell you what, South Carolina, 30 percent and more. South Carolina is amazing.\par \par \uc2 The way I look at it, Iowa is so great. Incredible people. New Hampshire, so great. Incredible people. Winning there, winning there, winning in South Carolina. Maybe, at some point, people are just going to give up. I don't know.\par \par \uc2 (END VIDEO CLIP)\par \par \uc2 LEMON: But let's begin with our breaking news. \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  one-on- one and the candidate joins me now on the phone.\par \par \uc2 Hello, Mr. Trump. Thank you for joining me.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Thank you, Don.\par \par \uc2 LEMON: Hey, let's get right to business because you have been a very busy man. And let's talk about you and Jeb Bush have been going back and forth. You put out an \uc2 Instagram\uc2  video attacking Jeb Bush on immigration on Monday. He is now hit back with a new video of his own calling you out as a liberal. I want to play part of it because I want you to respond. But let's listen to it first.\par \par \uc2 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 , I think is a terrific woman. I mean, I'm a little biased because I've known her for years. I know her very well. She's very talented.\par \par \uc2 I live in New York. She lives in New York and I've known her and her husband for years and I really like them both a lot.\par \par \uc2 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do you like them more for a democrat or a republican?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Well, you'd be shocked if I said that in many cases, I probably identify more as a democrat.\par \par \uc2 (END VIDEO CLIP)\par \par \uc2 LEMON: So, basically, Jeb Bush is saying that you're not a conservative republican and he's using your words to show that. You just released another video. Let's watch it and then we'll talk about it.\par \par \uc2 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\par \par \uc2 JEB BUSH, U.S PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: You recognize the commitment of someone who has devoted her life to public service. I want to say thank you to both Secretary Clinton and to President Clinton.\par \par \uc2 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What does that make \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  to the Bush family?\par \par \uc2 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: My sister-in-law.\par \par \uc2 (END VIDEO CLIP)\par \par \uc2 LEMON: What do you think of that, do you take -- do you take issue with Jeb Bush with that?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Well, look, when he did his a rather long commercial. You know, don't forget he's getting all of this money from people that are lobbyists and, you know, tough -- tough group of people. I know all of them and they wanted to do something, and he should do something. Because he's got to fight back.\par \par \uc2 And you know, he's way down on the polls and he's got to. But I was described in one of the magazines as a world class businessman. So, as a world class businessman, I knew everybody. I had to be friendly with everybody with, you know, doing business in this country, you want to be friendly with Clinton and you want to be friendly with everybody.\par \par \uc2 And I would help people and I would get along with people. That's part of my part, to my company, to my family, I owe that to everybody. So, I would do that. I would do it well as well as anybody.\par \par \uc2 And you know, I was part of the group so I would contribute to a guy like Jeb Bush, and who's a nice guy, by the way, but to Jeb Bush and to everybody else.\par \par \uc2 And when Jeb is paying for these ads by the lobbyists by the special interests and by his donors and they want him to do something like this. But I would get along with Hillary. I'd get along with \uc2 Bill Clinton\uc2  . I'd get along with everybody.\par \par \uc2 Now I'm a different world. I'm in the world of politics, I'm sort of a politician, I guess you would say. And as you can see from the polls we're doing well because people are tired of politics as such.\par \par \uc2 And, you know, one other thing I'll say because he mentions the fact that I was at one point democrat. Well, in New York City, everybody was a democrat, practically. If you run for city council. If you run for political office, if you -- whoever wins the democrat primary is automatically -- that's the, you know, there was almost no election. Because the republicans hardly exist in New York City.\par \par \uc2 Well, that's where I was. If you look at Ronald Reagan -- he was a democrat. He was actually, Don, he was a democrat with a very liberal or at least a pretty liberal bent. And then he became a republican with a somewhat conservative republican. I would say very but he was a conservative republican.\par \par \uc2 LEMON: But Mr. Trump, that's the first time I've ever heard of you, you know, call yourself a politician. You referred yourself as a politician, and I mean, or did you -- did you ever consider yourself a politician?\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I hate to do it. I hate to do it. But I guess when you're running for office I hate the term politician as it relates to myself. I've never been. I've only been a politician for three months. But, you know, I guess that's what I am right now.\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 LEMON: Were you a democrat at that point?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: That's going to be politics as usual.\par \par \uc2 LEMON: Were you a democrat at that point when you said that?\par \par \uc2 [22:05:03] TRUMP: Well, as one point, I was -- at one point I was a democrat and for a period of time. And over the years, as Ronald Reagan changed, I also changed. I became much more conservative. I also became a republican.\par \par \uc2 LEMON: So, your position got changed. You have conservation positions now you believe?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: All my positions are change a lot absolutely over the years.\par \par \uc2 LEMON: OK.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: As they have with Ronald Reagan, Don. As they have with many people. I mean, you changes and some people go the other way, they become more liberal. Although generally, I've found people tend to become a little bit conservative.\par \par \uc2 LEMON: OK.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: But now I am actually a politician whether I like it or not.\par \par \uc2 LEMON: OK. I want to get to those polls. But let's -- one quick theme before you get to the polls. I think the polls are important. One more short excerpt. This is from Jeb's ad because I want to give you a chance to respond to this, as well. Here it is.\par \par \uc2 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I lived in New York City in Manhattan all of my life. OK? So, you know, my views are a little bit different than if I lived in Iowa.\par \par \uc2 (END VIDEO CLIP)\par \par \uc2 LEMON: The question is that because of the Iowa polls, you know that you're leading in the polls, right?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Right.\par \par \uc2 LEMON: And there's some polls that are saying that you're tied with Ben Carson. Are you worried that people there might see it as a bit of an insult that, you know, New York is not the same as Iowa?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: No, I don't mean it as an insult. I think the values of the people in Iowa are incredible. But it is somewhat different when you're living in this huge, you know, metropolis, its huge city. The views have a tendency to be somewhat different. I mean, all you have to do is look at both profile.\par \par \uc2 But my relationship with the people of Iowa has been great. Every time I go to Iowa have the most incredible reception. And that goes in all fairness, New Hampshire where we had -- you saw a tremendous turn outs and Iowa have tremendous turnouts, South Carolina.\par \par \uc2 The other say we're in -- two weeks ago, we were in Alabama. We had 30,000 people in a stadium. You know, the turnout has been absolutely tremendous.\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 LEMON: You know, I saw that. I saw that, honestly, though. When you see that many people, what did you think?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Well, I think was a great tribute to what we're all saying. We want to make our country great again. These are people that are really wanting to make this country great. They hate to see what's going on, whether it's a horrible deal with Iran that, you know, that a baby could negotiate a better deal than deal.\par \par \uc2 And I like the idea of deal but they should have doubled up the sanctions for another couple of months and they would have come to the table and they would have been begging to make a god deal.\par \par \uc2 We don't get our prisoners back. They have 24-day inspections. You know, there is something in the Iran deal that people I don't think really understand or know about. And nobody is ever to explain it that if somebody attacks Iran, we have to come to their defense.\par \par \uc2 And I'm saying this that includes Israel? And most people say, yes. They don't have exclusion for us here. So, if Israel attacks Iran according to that deal, I believe, the way it reads unless they have a codicil or they have something to it, that we have to fight with Iran against Israel.\par \par \uc2 Now, you tell me. I mean, you're the one that does this professionally for a living. What is this agreement say? If that's the case I think it's unsignable. How could you possibly sign such a thing?\par \par \uc2 LEMON: Let's talk about, you said, you know, it was a tribute to people wanting to take their country. Because I know you've heard the criticism that phrases you with Nixon. And people out there saying it is a dog whistle to some sort of -- there is some sort of racist intent behind it. Can you please respond to that?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: No, I think the phrase that they're talking about is the word "silent majority." You know, when you have the word "silent majority," to me, it's just a very obvious ways. There is a silent majority out there that actually becoming much less silent. Because when you look at Iowa and the crowds I have and those people are going wild to, you know, with enthusiasm. And you look at New Hampshire to same thing. And you look at that football stadium with 30,000 people, they are not so silent anymore.\par \par \uc2 They're angry and they're upset, Don, with what' going on and they, you know, they don't like what's happening with our trade deals. They don't like what's happening on the border. They don't like, as I said, what's happening with Iran and that horrible deal that was made by a bunch of babies.\par \par \uc2 I mean, these are people that don't know the first thing about negotiation. And how a deal like that can get approved that's inconceivable. We're giving them $150 billion plus, plus, plus...\par \par \uc2 LEMON: Yes.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: ... and nobody can understand why we can't negotiate a far better deal than that. And I cannot understand that because I think that's negotiating 101, there's no way that that deal should be approved.\par \par \uc2 LEMON: Let me...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: If it's approve it's going to be -- it's going to be the scourge on our nation. And by the way, a disaster for Israel.\par \par \uc2 LEMON: Yes.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: A complete disaster for Israel.\par \par \uc2 LEMON: OK. Let's talk about the polls because I know those are important to you. You just noted that Ben Carson is running neck-in- neck in one poll, 23 percent in the latest Iowa poll. Are you surprised by this poll and his popularity, seeming popularity?\par \par \uc2 [22:09:59] TRUMP: Well, I was a little bit surprised to see it. I have been leading in Iowa by a lot. I had a bigger surge than anybody even Ben because, you know, when I was first done, as you saw it. I think I was -- before I announced, I was at, you know, sort of at a low number because nobody thought I was going to run.\par \par \uc2 And then when I did announce, I had the biggest surge of all, if you call it in your professional business, the surge. And I went up to 23, and Ben's doing nicely, too. I like Ben. I think Ben is a nice person. I've, you know, I've met him a numerous times and I like him.\par \par \uc2 LEMON: Are you going to go after him like you've been going after Jeb and Hillary now that he is doing...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Well, you know, I usually go after people -- I'm more of a counter puncher as they would say in the boxing world. I tend to be, you know, Jeb went after me and, if you know, Perry went after me and I went after him. And \uc2 Rand Paul\uc2 , for some reason out of the blue came after me and I went after him.\par \par \uc2 And the other one I guess would be \uc2 Lindsey Graham\uc2  . I thought these people were all fine and they came after me and then I had to go after them and perhaps I did a better job than they did. But they all went down. And they went down big leg.\par \par \uc2 You know, Ben and I have gotten to know each other over the years. I like him and I don't know. I can't tell you what's going to happen because I really don't know. You know, politics is a very -- it's a very strange thing and a very strange place that you end up in. But I can tell you that he's somebody that I like on a personal basis.\par \par \uc2 LEMON: And when we come back, I'm going to ask \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  about his closed door meeting today with the top Hispanic leader and why he thinks a lot of democrats will vote for him.\par \par \uc2 [22:15:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)\par \par \uc2 LEMON: \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  's surge shows no signs of tapering off. The mogul who wants to be your next president topping all the national polls.\par \par \uc2 You have turned your favorability numbers around. The majority -- with the majority having a positive view now, do you worry that they increase negative attacks on you by Jeb Bush and by other that they may turn that back? Because, again, your favorability numbers are up?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Well, it was sort of an amazing thing. They said in the polls and that same poll that you're quoting, which I think was at 23 percent. They said that it was one of the biggest turnarounds of favorability that these polls body has ever seen.\par \par \uc2 LEMON: why do you think that is?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I think when people hear me speak. I think they realize I love the country. I'm good at what I do. I will not let China, Japan, Mexico both at border and at trade out smart us and take advantage of us. I mean, we're going to be creating jobs in this country. They see it.\par \par \uc2 I'm very big into the vets. I'm going to take care of our vets and I'm going to rebuild our military. We're going to make it great again and strong again, and nobody is going to mess with us. Not a military that we're going to want to use.\par \par \uc2 You know, if you make it strong and really strong, nobody's going to want to mess with us and that's true.\par \par \uc2 LEMON: Yes.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: The expressing I've been using. And we're going to end Obamacare. We're going to do something far better than Obama. So, and people see what's happening with Obamacare. You know, you look at your premiums, they're going up -- they're going through the roof.\par \par \uc2 And look at the deductibles on insurance now. It's -- I mean, unless you die you can't -- its people can be gravely ill and they're going to get to the deductible.\par \par \uc2 So, a lot of bad things are happening in the country and I'll turn them round.\par \par \uc2 LEMON: And you...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: So, when I look at that and when people here me speak, in this case it was Iowa, yes, the polls are actually said it's one of the greatest -- he said actually, I think he said the greatest turnaround he's ever seen.\par \par \uc2 And, hey, you know, it's one of those things. I'm very honored by it.\par \par \uc2 LEMON: But you said that you're going to do something about immigration. You said that you would -- the 11 million undocumented immigrants that you would like to somehow deport one group. That's one group where your poll numbers have not been so favorable among Hispanics. And I know that you met privately with the head of the Hispanics Chamber of Commerce today.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: We did.\par \par \uc2 LEMON: Tell me about that meeting. What did you discussed? Was it tensed?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Well, he was a terrific person actually and we had a very nice -- we have a very nice meeting. And it worked out, I think, you know, we had a very good understanding.\par \par \uc2 I told him all my life I've had great relationship with Hispanics. And I've employed tens of thousands over my career and I have thousands working for me. And they are great people. They have been -- they're fantastic people.\par \par \uc2 And this has nothing do with Hispanic. This has to do with illegal immigration. They may come from the Middle East; they may come from lots of other people. But the southern border is totally perish and you can't have that. If you're to have a country you can't have that.\par \par \uc2 And we had a great conversation and it will continue. It was really a very good Javier. He came up and we had a really good conversation. And you know, in one of the polls that just came out, I don't know if you saw it. But I just won the Hispanic vote in terms of the poll, I won it.\par \par \uc2 LEMON: Yes.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: That's sitting right in front of you, I guess. And another one I just won in Nevada, the Hispanic vote. And I think I'm going to win with Hispanics. And a lot of people sort of smile when they said that. But actually, the people that live here, Hispanics that are legal, that came in through the long, hard process, they absolutely have a great feeling about me. And I have a great feeling about them.\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 LEMON: But it's in a long...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: It has to be legal immigration, not illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 LEMON: But Mr. Trump, it's been a long, hard, I would say a hard slug with Hispanics because, you know, the comments that you made initially about Mexico sending its, you know, people over...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Well, that's because I was misquoted by the press. I mean, the press was misquoted me and you know that, Don. All over the place. And frankly, had I not been in this race as an example, you wouldn't even be talking right now that illegal immigration. It wasn't something that was high on the agenda.\par \par \uc2 And now, they are talking about a big league. Now you had things happen after I announced and after I brought it to the floor. And one of the things was Kate. It was beautiful Kate killed in San Francisco. Other people killed. Even the woman two weeks ago, in California, who was a 66-year-old veteran who was raped, and killed, and tortured and everything else by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 And 66-year-old veteran. And a lot of things have happened and they see the kind of crime that we're talking about. And I've had people in your profession quietly apologize to me for what happened.\par \par \uc2 [22:20:04] Because that first two weeks for me was not pleasant, Don, frankly.\par \par \uc2 LEMON: I can only imagine because, again, you said you were taken out of context because you said that...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Totally out of context.\par \par \uc2 LEMON: ... that Mexico sends out people over. But if you could go back, would you amend those statement?.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: No.\par \par \uc2 LEMON: would you say them more fairly? TRUMP: No, because I think in the end -- no, I don't think so.\par \par \uc2 Because in the end, I'm now being quoted correctly and we're talking about illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 LEMON: Yes.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: And, again, if I wasn't in this race nobody wouldn't even be talking about illegal immigration and the problems.\par \par \uc2 LEMON: I'd like to clear up -- I'll like to clear up context and I like to get people to, as you know, to get on the record. Because is it true that you joke that you don't need the Hispanic vote? As a nominee, if indeed so, how would you win the general election if you're a nominee?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: No, I never said you don't need the Hispanics. I think I'm going to win the Hispanics. I never said that. I will say this however. When \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2  ran, there was a tremendous millions of people that are republicans and conservative republicans and Evangelicals, and people that I have a great relationship with.\par \par \uc2 They stay at home for some reason and they did not vote. You know that. And I'm talking about millions of people. And had they gotten up and voted for \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2  he would have won the election.\par \par \uc2 LEMON: Yes.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: And people are forgetting about that. Plus, I think, me, more than anybody else I'll cross -- I'll go across line. I think I'll have a lot of democrats. You know, Reagan had democrats for Reagan. It was a very big group of people and a very big Reagan.\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 LEMON: The Reagan democrats.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I think I'll have democrats for Trump. I think I will have a lot of democrats voting for me, far more than any republican for the last long period of time. I will say this and I will say this, you know, very strongly. The republican conservatives were not energized in the last election. Had they been energized and had they voted, you would have seen victory for \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2  .\par \par \uc2 LEMON: And there are lots more to come when it comes to Donald trump here. Up next, he tells me who he wants to tax, how he will take on China and if he's changed his mind on campaign fund raising.\par \par \uc2 [22:25:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)\par \par \uc2 LEMON: Donald trump says he is the man to reform taxes in this country. But how he plans to do it may surprise you.\par \par \uc2 This is something that some people don't think is a conservative issue that you are -- that you have waited on. And I was surprise actually to hear you say it. I shouldn't be surprise to hear you say anything. But last Friday, when you were in Massachusetts you said several times that your plan is to increase taxes on the richest Americans and you specially targeted...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I didn't say that.\par \par \uc2 LEMON: ... hedge fund managers though. OK.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Yes. I say that it's different. There's a big difference. What you're saying is very different. Now, I want to create great incentives. I want to reduce taxes. But what I said to hedge fund guys. I know the hedge fund guys. They're all supporting Bush and \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 . And some of the other candidates.\par \par \uc2 I won't take their money. You know, I turned down today millions of dollars. Fund raisers. They want to have -- everybody wants to have fundraisers for me because, you know, you're in first place, according to every poll and they all want to have fund raisers, right?\par \par \uc2 I turned down millions and millions of dollars where all I have to do is go to somebody's house and have a fund raisers. But every time if I ever do that I end up with all sorts of, you know, probably connections and do this and do that. I don't want to do it.\par \par \uc2 And part of the reason that people are really I think generally rating toward me is the fact that I'm not doing it. But I feel, I actually tweeted recently I said I feel stupid. I'm turning down millions and millions of dollars, I just hope the voters appreciate it when it comes to hand the vote.\par \par \uc2 LEMON: Yes.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Because I'm spending my own money and it's going to be a lot of money by the time I finished. And I'm turning all of these people that want me to do fundraisers for myself.\par \par \uc2 Now you see Bush all over the place. You see Hillary all over the place. You see every one of these guys, most of their time is consumed by doing fundraisers. Now every time they do a fundraiser, they're bought and they're sold and they're owned to a large extent. And in some cases completely, I will tell you that by the people that are putting up money. I'm not doing that.\par \par \uc2 LEMON: All right. Let me finish the question because you had proposed that you want to impose tariffs on American companies who put their factories abroad. You also said hedge fund managers. And my question is, do you think that you can win a republican primary by proposing to raise taxes?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Totally. We're losing all of our jobs. We're losing all our business. You have a terrible thing happening right now, Don. It's called corporate inversion. You know what that is?\par \par \uc2 LEMON: No, I don't. What is it? TRUMP: That's why our companies are leaving this country in order to\par \par \uc2 go out to other countries for lower tax rates. Where companies have -- we have $2.5 trillion, at least, out. Where company have the money out. I have some of them out. We have $2.5 trillion outside of the country. They can't get the money into this country because the taxes are so honors.\par \par \uc2 That frankly would a quick -- with some quick movement and thinking we could get that money coming into this country and to spend the money in this country.\par \par \uc2 And what they're doing is they're buying small companies and they're leaving the United States in order to save on taxes and in order to get the money that they have sitting out there. It's called corporate inversion.\par \par \uc2 And you should take a look at it because to me, it's a very big thing. You know, it used to be where a company would leave New York for Florida, or they would leave New Jersey for Texas, or they'd leave another state for another state, right? State-to-state, it's called.\par \par \uc2 Now companies are leaving the United States for another country.\par \par \uc2 LEMON: OK.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: And they're going to Ireland and they're going to other countries where the tax rates are low. And we're losing tremendous companies and we're losing tremendous number of jobs.\par \par \uc2 LEMON: I just...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: That's a huge problem. I will be able to solve that problem. You don't have anybody else running that knows what. They don't even know what it is.\par \par \uc2 LEMON: But again, you think you can win the republican primary by proposing to raise taxes?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I'm not proposing to raise taxes. I'm lowering taxes on the middle class and the upper middle class and the moderately wealthy. I'll be lowering taxes. The middle class is getting clobbered. So, that's where...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 LEMON: But isn't that raising taxes on the wealthiest of Americans? That's not raising taxes?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Hey, Don, let me explain. You reported it incorrectly. I said these hedge fund guys are making hundreds of millions of dollars and they're not paying tax.\par \par \uc2 [22:30:00] LEMON: right.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: And they're paying very little tax. And if you're somebody that's making 50,000 and 60,000, and $70,000, number one, your return is so complicated. You have to go H&R block or somebody who I want to put out a business because we have to simplify the tax code. We have to lower the taxes. But we have to lower the taxes on the middle class because we're losing our middle class. They're getting wiped out.\par \par \uc2 LEMON: Yes. OK. Let's -- as I am interviewing you now, I just got an alert that says stocks starts September with a nose dive as the Dow closes nearly 470 points. The markets got tumble again today. More concerns about China of a slow down there. Talk of about China is a big part of your campaign message and they're...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Yes. I've been calling this for a long time. I'm telling you it's a big bubble.\par \par \uc2 LEMON: But they've said missed your attacks as, quote, "disturbances." Are you surprised by that?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I don't know what you mean. What I'm saying is that disturbances?\par \par \uc2 LEMON: That's what they said disturbances.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Not a disturbance. I get along great with China. China loves me. I'm in the biggest banks in the world that my buildings, I mean, they are there from China. I do business with China. China knows I know what I'm talking about.\par \par \uc2 Look, China has taken advantage of the United States to a point that you cannot understand. China -- it's one of the great steps in the history of this world, what China has done to -- they've drained our jobs, they've drained our money. Because their politicians are much smarter than our politicians.\par \par \uc2 I will change that around. We will take back jobs and we will just fine. And we'll actually have a better -- China doesn't even like us. We don't even have a good relationship with China. And they've taken our money, our jobs, our base. They've taken so much from us and they don't even like us. They don't even respect us. We will turn that around.\par \par \uc2 And you know what, they'll like us better than they do now.\par \par \uc2 LEMON: What would you do...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: And not only China, there are many other countries.\par \par \uc2 LEMON: How would you calm the markets now and keep the economy going right now.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Well, right now, what you have to do is you need better trade deals. Because the trade deals are just absolutely just ripping us left and right. And part of the reason you're seeing this tremendous, you know, this tremendous swings in the stock market, is because we are just getting hammered by other countries.\par \par \uc2 We're so intricately woven to China and other places, that when they problems they're going to take us down. And I've been saying this. I believe in free trade. But, Don, we don't have free trade. You need smart people to have free trade. I love the idea of free trade. But it's free trade with us.\par \par \uc2 But when we go to China and we got to Japan, look at the cars that Japan is selling us, we give them practically nothing by comparison. We sell them beef and they don't want it. I mean, you always read with having big protests, farmers over there. They don't want our beef and they don't want what we sell them, which all perishable stuff.\par \par \uc2 They sell us millions of cars and they come pouring out of these massive ships. It has to be fair, Don. Our country is losing its jobs. It's losing its base. It's losing its money. And then on top of everything else, Don, we owe China $1.4 trillion. Think of it.\par \par \uc2 They make a fortune with -- and we owe them money. We owe Japan $1.4 trillion. It's the same exact amount. we owe them each $1.4 trillion. With all of the stuff that they do we owe them money.\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 LEMON: I want to ask you. I want to ask you about because as I said and watch last week and I interviewed the gentleman who owns the car dealerships who held the fundraiser for you. Now, is it -- you said you don't want to be beholden to any donors.\par \par \uc2 Was it a fundraiser, was it in a fundraiser?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: No, no.\par \par \uc2 LEMON: Are you accepting donations?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: No. Let me explain to you what it was. He's a very good guy. He's up in that area in Massachusetts. He wanted to do something for me. And somebody put out a sign make a contribution for the cause. By the way, that 2,000 people they were serving roast beef and everything else. And somebody put out a sign to defer costs for, I thought it was for him because I assumed he was paying for it. I don't know. What do I know? I'm not involved in that.\par \par \uc2 But, they had a thing to defer some cause. The costs were far greater than the money they took in, far greater.\par \par \uc2 LEMON: Yes.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: But that was just to defer some cause. I'm not even going to do it anymore. From now on I'm going to pay for my -- you're talking about peanuts. They're talking about nothing.\par \par \uc2 Now, most of the people came in for free. They had a choice of coming in for free of making a contribution. And the contribution was only to defer some of the costs for him because I didn't think it was fair for him to pay when I heard he was paying. He's a good guy, very good guy, and that's all that was.\par \par \uc2 LEMON: So, you're not holding any more fundraisers?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Don, I'm not going to do it anymore because it's too complicated. People don't understand what it represents. I mean if you something to defer cost, you end up with a story on \uc2 CNN\uc2  because \uc2 CNN\uc2  was the one that covered that, frankly, and they actually covered it very incorrectly, but these are minor details.\par \par \uc2 LEMON: So, even though the sign said...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: It gets to be, Don, it gets to be too complicated because people don't know the difference making a contribution to defer cost. I'm just going to pay for the whole thing myself. Because it's, you know, you get stories that are false stories. And, yet, I can understand how they can be rip, frankly.\par \par \uc2 LEMON: All right. So, no more fundraisers throughout this campaign?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: No, I'm not going to do it.\par \par \uc2 LEMON: You're not going to do it.\par \par \uc2 [22:34:58] TRUMP: Now, I have to say this. With all of that being said, many people have forms PACS. I think there is five or six PACS. I have had nothing to do with them.\par \par \uc2 LEMON: OK.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I can't help. I saw two guys being interviewed, I think on your network, they were being interviewed they formed a PAC. It's having to do some PAC that they name. And they said it's for Trump because we love Trump.\par \par \uc2 I never met them. I may never meet them in the future.\par \par \uc2 LEMON: OK.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: You know, I can't help if somebody forms a PAC, if they want to go out and do some advertising or do something. I have nothing to do with that. I'm not putting money into it. I have nothing to do with it.\par \par \uc2 LEMON: OK.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: But, you know, that's the crazy law that we have right now. If somebody wants to form a PAC because they love \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  and they think it's important that I get in because I'm going to make the country rich again and make the country great again, I can't help that.\par \par \uc2 So, they may be PACS formed. I think there's five or six PACS already that are formed. And I assumed these guys are going to go out and do answer something. But, it has nothing to do with me, Don.\par \par \uc2 LEMON: OK. TRUMP: You know the law better than me.\par \par \uc2 LEMON: OK.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: And purposely, I'm not even supposed to talk to those people and I don't. I think other people do talk to people having to do with that, but I don't.\par \par \uc2 LEMON: All right. Just before we move on, though, are you going to accept donations, large donations, small donations if people want to give you money?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: No. The answer is no.\par \par \uc2 LEMON: No. OK.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I'm not going to do that.\par \par \uc2 LEMON: OK. That's it. I just want you...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Cash donations -- wait a minute. Wait. Small donations. People sending in $100 and $7 and $9, and we do accept that because they want to invest in the campaign and it's relative peanuts. But you know what, they want to be a part of it. And I love that.\par \par \uc2 LEMON: OK.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: That's not influence. That's not a lobbyist. Give me five million where I turn down $5 million where they want to put in millions and millions of dollars. That's people that want to invest in the campaign. That, I happen to love.\par \par \uc2 I think it's a really good thing and I think it's a really positive thing. It's a relatively, it's a very small amount of money overall. But it still, that kind of money, just because I don't want to have a misunderstanding with you.\par \par \uc2 So, you know, I have a woman sends $7 and a long beautiful note. I have people that are sending $100 and $200 and 250, and things. That kind of stuff I do like. I think it's a positive. And frankly, I think it's insulting when they send in a check of $10 and $19 and we send it back. We don't want your money. You want to know the truth I think it's almost an insult to them.\par \par \uc2 LEMON: Yes.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: So, that kind of money we do accept and we like it because we think it's a positive for the campaign.\par \par \uc2 LEMON: When we come right back, \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  answers the charge that he uses on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  to go after his people on his, quote, "enemy's list."\par \par \uc2 [22:40:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK) LEMON: I want to get on now to one of your other opponents and that's \uc2 Chris Christie\uc2 . He was on Jimmy Fallon last night and he was asked about you. Here it is.\par \par \uc2 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\par \par \uc2 JIMMY FALLON, COMEDIAN: So, you have \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  now in the lead of all of these polls. Is this a surprise to you? Do you know him that...\par \par \uc2 CHRIS CHRISTIE\uc2  , U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Oh, no. I completely expected that, didn't you?\par \par \uc2 FALLON: No.\par \par \uc2 CHRISTIE: Of course, everything he does is spectacular, wonderful, amazing.\par \par \uc2 FALLON: Yes. Super, fantastic.\par \par \uc2 CHRISTIE: Trump is the best.\par \par \uc2 (END VIDEO CLIP)\par \par \uc2 LEMON: What do you think of his impression of you?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Well, I thought it was fine. He was trying to be cute and funny. And he's a nice guy. I actually like Chris. I've known him for a long time, and he's trying to be cute and trying to be funny. And you know, he's out there pitching. He's trying to get on to the main stage. He's got, you know, not a lot of time to do. And I actually found it to be fun. I like Chris. I always have,\par \par \uc2 LEMON: OK. Here is what I want to ask, because you mentioned you said earlier in the interview, you said, I tweeted out something out the other day -- and I just want to ask you, if you -- let me read this then I'll ask you the question.\par \par \uc2 This is \uc2 USA Today\uc2  . There's an op-ed calling out you quote as "unpresidential." We'll put the quote up. I don't want to read the whole thing. But it says, "Are American voters really looking for a president who spent his evening sending out nasty and petty tweets about journalists rather than, say, working his way on how to defeat the \uc2 Islamic State\uc2  .\par \par \uc2 And then it goes on. It is a longer statement, but do you ever think like when you're about to tweet, like maybe I shouldn't say that or, is there someone there, you know, Mr. Trump, take your hands off the keys, don't do that.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: No, I don't do that. I mean, look, I out tweet and I have fun with it and my people. You know, I have more than four million on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  . I have millions on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  . I think I have like nine million with \uc2 Instagram\uc2  and all of these things with...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 LEMON: They're comparing you to Richard Nixon, they're saying you have an "enemy's list."\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Well, I have a group of people that I don't respect. I have people in your profession that have great admiration to respect for. And I also have many in your profession unfortunately, who I know are very dishonest people.\par \par \uc2 So, what \uc2 Twitter\uc2  does allow me to do is that allows to reveal those people. You know, in the old days you weren't able to do that. But it allows me to reveal when somebody is dishonest. And you do have dishonest people in the media and it's sad.\par \par \uc2 When I had source written about me knowingly false stories, I mean, they reported news that was false. And when we called them on it, they actually practically admitted that they knew what they did was wrong but they were looking for headline or they were looking for.\par \par \uc2 So, you have a lot of very dishonest people in the media. At the same time, you have some very fine and very fine people. And I would say this with \uc2 Twitter\uc2  , with \uc2 Facebook\uc2  , with all of that stuff. It gives you, not just me, it gives people a voice. And it's something I think very reassuring about that.\par \par \uc2 LEMON: As we are doing this interview now there has been a situation in Illinois with police officers. There was a Dallas police officer sheriff deputy who was killed last week. Some have said that the climate in this country is lending to police officers being put into more danger. What do you make of that? Do you believe that is true?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Oh, I think the police are in a terrible position. They're so -- they're such great people, and, yes, you do have your bad apples every once in a while. But a tiny, tiny percentage. And what's happening with the police, when you look at Baltimore, a place I knew well and know well.\par \par \uc2 And you look at what happen on that person they've done you covered it very brilliantly. You would, you know, you saw what was going on. The police stood back. I mean, you have to have law in order. You cannot have a situation where the police are afraid to talk to somebody. Because they're going to be fired, lose their attention, lose their life, lose their house.\par \par \uc2 And what's happening now is the police are some amazing people, but they're afraid to act and they're afraid to do what's right. And people want protection. The people want the protection.\par \par \uc2 [22:44:59] So, you see it more and more and the respect is to take it away from the police. And that's a very bad thing for the country and it's a very bad thing for security and safety.\par \par \uc2 LEMON: Do you think that because you talked about the Black Lives Matter ladies who interrupted Bernie Sanders. Do you think that this -- that Black Lives Matter the group or the rhetoric has contributed to this at all?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I think it was terrible when they took the microphone away from him. I thought that was a disgraceful situation. I mean, I had a similar type of situation with Mr. Ramos of \uc2 Univision\uc2  and I think it was handled much more professionally to be honest. And I've actually been given very good reviews even by people in your profession. Because he was, you know, he was out of order.\par \par \uc2 By it ended being very nice and we've brought him back and he -- we had a, you know, civil. By the time we finished at the end of three or four minutes, I think he was actually very interesting. We actually we seem to be getting along.\par \par \uc2 But I thought it was terrible that Bernie Sanders allowed that microphone to be ripped out of his hand because that's essentially what happened. And the people in the audience were going, what's going on over here. Take the mic back. You know, the people that were listening, they were people that, I would say probably like him, they couldn't understand how it could allow to -- to me, it showed tremendous weakness.\par \par \uc2 LEMON: But as it relates to law enforcement and the climate in the country, do you think that Black Lives Matter is dangerous when or...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I don't know that. I can't answer that question. No. But, again, who knows what's going. All I know is that the police are tremendous people. And, yes, you will have some bad ones as you do any profession and any, you know, walk of life. But the police are tremendous people. They do, overall, a tremendous job. And they have to be allowed to do their job.\par \par \uc2 LEMON: Thank you, \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  .\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Thank you very much, Don.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020150902eb92006pr\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 September has arrived and, with it, comes the \uc2 NFL\uc2  's regular season.\u160\'00\'A0The \uc2 Redskins\uc2  \u160\'00\'A0will bench quarterback Robert Griffin III and start Kirk Cousins, perhaps (finally)\u160\'00\'A0bringing an end to a\u160\'00\'A0years-long saga full of injuries and dashed hopes.\par \par \uc2 THE BIG IDEA:\u160\'00\'A0 The State Department posted a\u160\'00\'A0new tranche of Hillary Clinton's e-mails around 9 p.m.\u160\'00\'A0Of the\u160\'00\'A0more than 7,000 pages from 2009 and 2010, about 150 of the e-mails were partially or entirely censored because the State Department said its officials determined that they contained classified material. Read The Post's story focused on what the sensitive e-mails said\u160\'00\'A0here. See\u160\'00\'A0all the key e-mails in one place\u160\'00\'A0here.\u160\'00\'A0Here are six\u160\'00\'A0nuggets:\par \par \uc2 IT folks at State did not know about the Clintons' e-mail setup: The "help desk" sought information about why a correspondent was getting a "fatal error" when sending messages to Clinton's obscure address. The tech support team "didn't know it was you," an aide tells Hillary.\par \par \uc2 On the day Republicans won the House majority in 2010, Sidney Blumenthal e-mailed HRC that incoming Speaker \uc2 John Boehner\uc2  (R-Ohio) "is louche, alcoholic, lazy, and without any commitment to any principle." Several organizations, including the Wall Street Journal and Washington Examiner, focus on all the advice Blumenthal offered.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  leads its story with Chelsea Clinton warning her parents that international relief efforts in Haiti were a disaster and that major changes were needed after a four-day trip. "To say I was profoundly disturbed by what I saw \u8212\'20\'14 and didn't see \u8212\'20\'14 would be an understatement," Chelsea Clinton wrote in a memo addressed to "Dad, Mom" and attached to an e-mail she sent while her mother was secretary of state and her father was leading relief efforts for the 2010 earthquake in Haiti. "The incompetence is mind numbing." (\uc2 NYT\uc2  )\par \par \uc2 Hillary was interested in any insight into the potential 2012 presidential aspirations of \uc2 David Petraeus\uc2  , who ultimately took a job as CIA director. (\uc2 Politico\uc2 )\par \par \uc2 She\u160\'00\'A0e-mailed Maryland Democratic Sen. Barbara Mikulski to ask for an update on her state's governor, \uc2 Martin O'Malley\uc2 , in April 2010. "I know he has a rematch when he should be reelected by acclamation for steering the ship of state so well," she wrote. He was an early endorser in 2008 but has become critical now that he's challenging her for the nomination. (\uc2 CNN\uc2  )\par \par \uc2 [Sign up for The Daily 202, The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2  's new political tipsheet]\par \par \uc2 Lanny Davis desperately begged for Hillary to speak with a reporter profiling him for the American Lawyer magazine, of all places, in a characteristically over-the-top, three-page e-mail.\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 Concerned about Elizabeth Warren and the progressive base as \uc2 Joe Biden\uc2  flirts with a run, Hillary continued her\u160\'00\'A0leftward shift by endorsing an anti-Wall Street bill. She backed\u160\'00\'A0a proposed change to federal law championed by liberal groups that is intended to slow or stop a revolving door between the financial sector and public service, making the announcement in an op-ed for the Huffington Post with Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.). Baldwin proposed the legislation last month. Bernie Sanders and \uc2 Martin O'Malley\uc2  quickly endorsed it. Elizabeth Warren basically called it a litmus test bill in her speech at Netroots last month. Clinton has held off on taking a position until now. Anne Gearen explains that "the\u160\'00\'A0bill would close what its supporters call a loophole, in which financial services executives can take accelerated payouts of restricted stock options and other forms of lump-sum payment if they leave those jobs" to work for the federal government.\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 Sneak peek \u8212\'20\'14 Mike Rounds to endorse \uc2 Mike Huckabee\uc2  :\u160\'00\'A0The freshman Republican senator from South Dakota will back the former Arkansas governor's presidential campaign today. Huckabee and Rounds became friends while serving\u160\'00\'A0as\u160\'00\'A0governors at the same time, and he campaigned for Rounds when his three-way race became suddenly competitive last year. "\uc2 Gov. Mike Huckabee\uc2  has the right combination of executive experience, electability and conservative convictions we need to take back the White House," Rounds says in a forthcoming statement, shared early with the 202. "I watched him defeat the Clinton machine, cut taxes and welfare, balance the budget 10 years straight, and raise average family income 50 percent, despite facing the most Democrat legislature in the country."\u160\'00\'A0Arkansas' senior senator, John Boozman, endorsed Huckabee earlier this year.\par \par \uc2 WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 Breaking: \uc2 Pope Francis\uc2  will permit Roman Catholic priests during the Holy Year starting Dec. 8 to absolve women who have had abortions, if they seek forgiveness.\u160\'00\'A0From the Pope's Bulletin, via NBC: "I know that it is an existential and moral ordeal. I have met so many women who bear in their heart the scar of this agonizing and painful decision," he wrote. "The forgiveness of God cannot be denied to one who has repented, especially when that person approaches the Sacrament of Confession with a sincere heart in order to obtain reconciliation with the Father."\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 A fresh poll shows how partisan\u160\'00\'A0the Iran debate has become.\u160\'00\'A0A survey by the \uc2 University of Maryland\uc2  finds that Americans narrowly support the deal, with 52 percent wanting Congress to approve it and 47 percent wanting the pact rejected.\u160\'00\'A0Nearly seven in 10 Democrats support it, and an\u160\'00\'A0identical share of Republicans are opposed. Among independents, six in 10 express support.\u160\'00\'A0A similar survey in February found that more than six in 10 people overall backed the broad outlines of a deal, with majorities among both Democrats and Republicans. Other public polls have shown more negative attitudes toward the deal:\u160\'00\'A055\u160\'00\'A0percent of voters opposed it in a \uc2 Quinnipiac University\uc2  poll released Monday \u8212\'20\'14 more than double the 25\u160\'00\'A0percent who supported it.

"The suit also names the \uc2 U.S. Bureau of Land Management\uc2  . The gun Sanchez is accused of using was stolen from a BLM agent's car. The family is also suing \uc2 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2  . \u8230\'20\'26 Mirkarimi's refusal to interact with ICE has sparked intense controversy in that debate [and] the embattled sheriff has not changed his position with ICE one bit."\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 In related news, ICE announced that\u160\'00\'A0a four-day sweep led to the arrest of 240\u160\'00\'A0undocumented\u160\'00\'A0immigrants with criminal records in Southern California. The feds said most of those 240 had at least one felony conviction on their record. "It was the most successful four-day sweep of its kind in the region," the\u160\'00\'A0\uc2 Los Angeles Times\uc2  reports. "But an ICE spokeswoman cautioned against concluding that crime involving immigrants is up."\par \par \uc2 GET SMART FAST:\par \par \uc2 * The Supreme Court turned down, without comment, a Kentucky county clerk's request to be excused from issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples, the court's first involvement in a series of legal battles that have erupted since gay couples won the right to marry.

(Eric Yoder)\par \par \uc2 * The sheriff's deputy who was killed "execution style" at a suburban Houston gas station was shot 15 times at close range and left to die "face-down in a pool of his own blood," a prosecutor said in court. Investigators\u160\'00\'A0believe he was targeted solely because he wore a uniform.\par \par \uc2 * The 9th Circuit rejected arguments from atheists as it ruled that a\u160\'00\'A06-foot-tall statue of Jesus that has spent the last 60 years overlooking a northwestern Montana ski hill may stay there, even though it is on \uc2 U.S. Forest Service\uc2  land. (Helena Independent Record)\par \par \uc2 * Many of the 30 million Hispanic Catholics in the United States hope the pope's visit this month\u160\'00\'A0shifts the tone of the immigration debate, Mary Jordan reports on the front page. For an ABC prime-time special, the pontiff\u160\'00\'A0gave a virtual audience\u160\'00\'A0yesterday to students at a Jesuit high school in Chicago, congregants at a church near the U.S.-Mexico border and those working with the homeless in Los Angeles.\par \par \uc2 * A grenade exploded outside Ukraine's parliament during a nationalist protest against a vote to give greater powers to pro-Russia separatist regions in the east, killing one police officer and injuring 122 people,\u160\'00\'A0the AP reports.\par \par \uc2 * China forced a journalist to "confess" on state television for\u160\'00\'A0causing the stock market plunge.\u160\'00\'A0"During a sensitive period, I should not have published a report which had such a huge negative impact," a wary-looking reporter for a respected business magazine\u160\'00\'A0said to camera, a disturbing reminder\u160\'00\'A0that rule of law and press freedom do not really exist in the communist country.\par \par \uc2 * "A court in Turkey's Kurdish-dominated southeast remanded in custody on terror charges two British journalists working for U.S.-based Vice News," AFP reports, another case sowing worries about press freedoms.\par \par \uc2 * Iran's parliament won't vote on the nuclear deal, the country's president said, because that would make it more legally binding. The parliament's own speaker, nonetheless, endorsed the deal at the United Nations yesterday.\par \par \uc2 POWER PLAYERS IN THE NEWS:\par \par \uc2 * Hillary will give a speech endorsing the Iran deal on Sept. 9, bracketing a joint Ted Cruz-Donald Trump\u160\'00\'A0protest against the agreement outside the Capitol on the same day.\u160\'00\'A0The Clinton campaign believes the split screen will work to their advantage.\par \par \uc2 * \uc2 Obama\uc2  will tape a special episode of\u160\'00\'A0the NBC outdoor adventure show "Running Wild with Bear Grylls" while in Alaska. Last night the president had dinner\u160\'00\'A0at the home of \uc2 Alice Rogoff\uc2  , the publisher of the Alaska Dispatch News and wife of billionaire David Rubenstein.\par \par \uc2 * Ohio Republicans\u160\'00\'A0stood in lock step as they decried\u160\'00\'A0\uc2 Obama\uc2  's announcement that he'll change the name of Mount McKinley to \uc2 Denali\uc2 , from \uc2 John Boehner\uc2  to John\u160\'00\'A0Kasich and\u160\'00\'A0Rob Portman.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2  is using virtually every tool in its\u160\'00\'A0lobbying arsenal to defend against\u160\'00\'A0attacks from conservatives and anti-abortion activists.\par \par \uc2 Lawmakers will raise the stakes when Congress returns next week by threatening to defund the group through the federal appropriations process.\par \par \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2 's counter-offensive is widespread and varied and is unfolding inside and outside the Beltway. The group has been\u160\'00\'A0organizing rallies, flooding lawmakers' town hall meetings, commissioning polls, shelling\u160\'00\'A0out six figures for television\u160\'00\'A0ads and\u160\'00\'A0hiring forensics experts to try to discredit undercover video footage that sparked the controversy.\par \par \uc2 The success of these lobbying efforts will be tested when Congress returns and must move a short-term spending bill to keep the government open. Some conservatives in both chambers are pushing to defund \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2 , even if a standoff with Democrats leads to a government shutdown.\par \par \uc2 [Sign up for The Daily 202, The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2 's new political tipsheet]\par \par \uc2 "We are pursuing it in order to stop sending taxpayer's money to a group that engages in activity that many people find abhorrent and repulsive," Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R-S.C.), who is among 18 members who have pledged to oppose a spending bill with \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2  funding, said in an email. "If we can do that while still funding the rest of the government, fine. If we cannot, and there is a lapse in appropriations, so be it."\par \par \uc2 The controversy began when the Center for Medical Progress released the first of a series of undercover videos on July 14, showing \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2  officials discussing sharing aborted fetal tissue with researchers. Congressmen and lawmakers have since been on a tear trying to defund the group on a national and state level.\par \par \uc2 But \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2  is hoping its August maneuvering will stop the defunding effort in its tracks.\par \par \uc2 In West Virginia and Iowa this month, \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2  supporters flocked to town hall\u160\'00\'A0meetings to\u160\'00\'A0lobby\u160\'00\'A0Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WestVa.), the first Democratic senator to oppose funding\u160\'00\'A0\uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2 , and Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa),\u160\'00\'A0who is\u160\'00\'A0co-sponsoring legislation to defund the organization.\par \par \uc2 In New Mexico, an art installation titled, "Thank You, \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2 " is underway. In Utah, where governor \uc2 Gary Herbert\uc2  (R) wants to redirect \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2  federal funds to other health agencies,\u160\'00\'A0several hundred people rallied at the capitol in support of continued funding for the organization.\par \par \uc2 In New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin \u8212\'20\'14 where state officials or congressional representatives are pushing\u160\'00\'A0to halt the group's funding \u8212\'20\'14 ads are airing on local television and cable stations. In those states,\u160\'00\'A0\uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2  also commissioned polls that show low public support for legislators who want to shut down the government over the funding fight.\u160\'00\'A0Op-ed pieces are being sent to media outlets around the country.\par \par \uc2 "Millions of Americans rely on \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2 's health centers for basic, reproductive health care each year \u8212\'20\'14 many of whom would have no where else to turn if they couldn't turn to us,"\u160\'00\'A0said\u160\'00\'A0Dawn Laguens, executive vice president of \uc2 Planned Parenthood Action Fund\uc2 , the lobbying and political arm of \uc2 Planned Parenthood Federation of America\uc2 .\u160\'00\'A0"When politicians threaten to cut off their care, they pay attention. We've already seen an outpouring of support for \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2 , and that's only compounded now that members of Congress are home and speaking with their constituents."\par \par \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2  supporters have placed\u160\'00\'A062,000 phone calls to lawmakers, collected\u160\'00\'A0900,000 signatures on #StandWithPP petitions, and gained 60,000 new \uc2 Facebook\uc2  supporters since July.\u160\'00\'A0Officials say donations to the organization are up, though they did not have a specific dollar figure, and some supporters are cheekily contributing\u160\'00\'A0in the name of\u160\'00\'A0Ted Cruz, \uc2 Marco Rubio\uc2  and other politicians advocating against \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 [People are donating to \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2  'in honor of' Cruz and Rubio]\par \par \uc2 And on Thursday, \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2  sent a report to Congress of\u160\'00\'A0an analysis\u160\'00\'A0by a research firm that found\u160\'00\'A0the videos\u160\'00\'A0were altered. The analysis was commissioned by the group and completed\u160\'00\'A0by\u160\'00\'A0Fusion GPS, a Washington-based firm that provides research and intelligence for corporations.\u160\'00\'A0The report\u160\'00\'A0was\u160\'00\'A0sent to House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).\par \par \uc2 "\uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2 's\u160\'00\'A0desperate, 11th-hour attempt to pay their hand-picked 'experts' to distract from the crimes documented on video is a complete failure," David Daleiden, founder of the Center for Medical Progress, said in\u160\'00\'A0a statement\u160\'00\'A0Thursday.\par \par \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2  declined to say how much the overall campaign is costing, but the television ads alone add up to\u160\'00\'A0at least\u160\'00\'A0$517,000, according to the \uc2 Sunlight Foundation\uc2 , which tracks political\u160\'00\'A0ad buys reported by television stations to the \uc2 Federal Communications Commission\uc2 . More than half of that, about $290,000, was spent on television ads airing in the Washington, D.C. region in late July, right\u160\'00\'A0before the Senate voted to block the GOP-led House bill to halt federal funds\u160\'00\'A0for \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 It is illegal to sell fetal tissue for profit, but individuals can consent to donate tissue.\u160\'00\'A0\uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2  has maintained that\u160\'00\'A0it does not sell fetal tissue for profit and that it has programs in three states \u8212\'20\'14 California, Washington and Oregon \u8212\'20\'14 where women can donate tissue following an abortion and that those programs comply with the\u160\'00\'A0law.\par \par \uc2 Last year, \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2  received $528 million in federal funding. By law, public funds\u160\'00\'A0cannot\u160\'00\'A0pay for abortions, but antiabortion groups\u160\'00\'A0say federal funding is indirectly subsidizing the procedures.\par \par \uc2 The videos\u160\'00\'A0have prompted congressional committees and several states to investigate \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2 's fetal tissue practices. The state probes that have been completed have not uncovered evidence of wrongdoing.\par \par \uc2 In Congress, House leaders are still debating how to address a push from many GOP members to defund the organization immediately. The initial plan was to channel members' anger into a series of investigations and steer the party away from tying the issue to federal spending bills.\par \par \uc2 Boehner directed three committees to investigate the organization. The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee is looking into how \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2  uses federal dollars and whether any of that money has been used for illegal purposes; the Energy and Commerce panel is looking into how group\u160\'00\'A0handles fetal tissue with brokers and the Judiciary Committee is investigating how the Justice Department has handled the issue.\par \par \uc2 Those committees are expected to hold hearings in September, shortly after Congress returns from the August\u160\'00\'A0recess.\par \par \uc2 The last time \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2  mounted\u160\'00\'A0a similarly concerted effort to defend its services was in 2011, when Live Action \u8212\'20\'14 the anti-abortion group that Daleiden previously\u160\'00\'A0worked for \u8212\'20\'14 released undercover "sting" videos using actors posing as a pimp and a prostitute seeking services at a \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2  clinic in New Jersey. An employee of the clinic appeared to advise the pair on how to obtain services for \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  prostitutes and sex workers as young as 14. The employee was fired shortly afterward.\par \par \uc2 Abortion services amount to 3 percent of \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2 's services, according\u160\'00\'A0to the organization's most recent annual report for 2013-14. The remaining 97 percent include\u160\'00\'A0women's health services such as\u160\'00\'A0testing and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases, contraception and cancer screening\u160\'00\'A0and prevention.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020150831eb8v002bh\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SPOKANE, Wash. -- Earlier this month, at the end of a press conference in Michigan, Donald Trump was asked how he'd react if someone tried to disrupt his press conference. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) had just walked away after two activists claiming to represent Black Lives Matter interrupted one of his appearances in Seattle. Would Trump hand over the mic like that?\par \par \uc2 "I would never give up my microphone," said Trump. "I thought that was disgusting. That showed such weakness."\par \par \uc2 On Tuesday, Trump was as good as his word. Jorge Ramos, the Univision and Fusion anchor, stood up at the start of Trump's press conference in Dubuque, Iowa, and started in on a question about immigration. The aftermath has dominated political news for 24 hours, with Ramos, perhaps the most recognizable Latino reporter in the country, winning accolades for refusing to sit down and let Trump talk. A video of Ramos being told to "go back" to his home country (he is a naturalized U.S. citizen who was born in Mexico) has gone viral.\par \par \uc2 But Trump was ready for Ramos. The key moment of the confrontation was not when Ramos was escorted out, but when he was allowed back in by Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks. Trump called on Ramos and went round after round with him, on live TV. If the downside of challenging Megyn Kelly was that it might alienate Fox News's conservative viewers, the downside of challenging Ramos was -- what? In a Republican primary, there was no downside whatsoever.\par \par \uc2 That was clear in almost every conservative reaction to the tete-a-tete. The conservative blogger Jim Hoft used the confrontation to promote the (long disclosed) fact that Ramos's daughter worked for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign.\u160\'00\'A0Fox News's Jesse Watters, who specializes in on-camera confrontations with left-wing subjects, said that Ramos "acted like an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 " and was treated accordingly. On site after site, conservatives scoffed at the idea that Ramos had done something heroic by standing up and saying Trump's immigration plan was built on "false promises" and racial animus.\par \par \uc2 "What he wants to say is that he thought he had a greater moral right to question Trump," wrote the anonymous blogger Allahpundit at HotAir.com. "He's an activist. Unlike the other reporters in the room, he was there to push a cause and wanted to use Trump's media megaphone to amplify it. When you're speaking open-borders 'truth' to security power, your righteous urgency leaves no room for professional courtesy."\par \par \uc2 Today, at a campaign rally for Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) in this eastern Washington city, every voter who was asked about the Trump/Ramos faceoff said that Trump had gotten the better of it.\par \par \uc2 "You know what Trump showed me?" said Debra Goodwin, a local \uc2 Tea Party\uc2  Patriots organizer. "That is a man in charge. It's not your turn yet! It wasn't his turn -- but he escorted him in when it was. And he won the argument."\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, in an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt, Trump was\u160\'00\'A0litigating the details of the Ramos argument. Hewitt, who will help ask questions in the next televised Republican debate, was on his side.\par \par \uc2 "He was screaming, and I thought it was actually very unfair not so much to me, which I guess you could say it was, but it was certainly very unfair to all the other reporters that were waiting with their hands up to take questions," said Trump. "I would have gotten to him, 100 percent. I have no problem with doing that."\par \par \uc2 "It was not professional," said Hewitt. "I've been doing this for 25 years. It wasn't professional. But it was successful for him, and it was also, though, very successful for you because of the way you handled him. And I was actually reminded, do you remember when the Iraqi threw the shoe at George W. Bush?"\par \par \uc2 "Yes," said Trump.\par \par \uc2 "And he didn't blink, and he just carried on?"\par \par \uc2 "Yes."\par \par \uc2 "That's what it reminded me of. And you see why?"\par \par \uc2 "Well," said Trump, "that may have been his best moment, if you want to know the truth, which is pretty sad to say."\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020150829eb8r004gp\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

I think the world of him, to step aside, so I wouldn't have to be part of the calculus of figuring out to get me back on board, and those kind of things. And as such, I had the opportunity to look at other situations and this is a situation that presented itself. And I'm very happy and very proud to be here.\par \par \uc2 (INAUDIBLE)\par \par \uc2 DONALD TRUMP\uc2  (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: OK. Who is next? Yes, please. Sit down. You weren't called.

Let's listen in.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Because I thought her questioning and her attitude was totally inappropriate. So it just -- well, if you look, all you have to do is look on the Internet and you will see who people favor in that one. But I wouldn't -- it is a very small element in my life, Megyn Kelly. I don't care about Megyn Kelly. No, I would not apologize.\par \par \uc2 She should probably apologize to me but I just don't care.\par \par \uc2 Yes, Katy. Go ahead.\par \par \uc2 REPORTER: (INAUDIBLE) a pledge to have the nominee on balance. (INAUDIBLE)\par \par \uc2 [No, \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  isn't hurting Republicans with Latinos (Part 2)]\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Right. We just heard about it today. And we're looking at it. We certainly have plenty of time. That doesn't come due for a long period of time. We certainly have -- September 30th. Yes, we certainly have a long period of time to think about it. So, we're thinking about it.\par \par \uc2 And, look, and I say to everybody, we're leading every poll, we're leading every state from Iowa to New Hampshire to South Carolina to North Carolina, polls have come in from virtually every place and we're leading every place. We're doing incredibly nationally.\par \par \uc2 The one poll came out today at 40 percent, over 40 percent. So my whole desire is just fairness. I want to run as the Republican nominee. I want to win. I think we will win. We have tremendous spirit in this party.\par \par \uc2 I've been contacted by so many people that haven't voted for years. They haven't voted for year. They love the \uc2 Republican Party\uc2 , but they haven't wanted to vote. They're going to be out there and they're energized.\par \par \uc2 We're going on win. So, I don't think it's going to matter because I think I'm going to get the nomination. And I think we're going to go on to win and we'll make America great again. so, that's all that matters to me.\par \par \uc2 Well, I didn't say that.\par \par \uc2 [18:50:00] I will certainly consider it. And we have a lot of time to worry about it.\par \par \uc2 Yes?\par \par \uc2 REPORTER: You're running for president and one of our country's top journalists, an anchor of Univision, was just escorted out of the news conference. Do you think you handle the situation --\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I don't know. I mean, I don't know really much about him. I don't believe I ever met him, except he started screaming and I didn't escort him out. You'll have to talk to security. Whoever security escorted him out.\par \par \uc2 But, certainly, he wasn't chosen. I chose you and you're asking me questions. He stands up and starts screaming. So, you know, maybe he's at fault, also.\par \par \uc2 But I don't consider that. I mean, somebody walked him out. I don't know where he is. I don't mind if he doesn't come back, frankly.\par \par \uc2 Yes? Yes?\par \par \uc2 (INAUDIBLE)\par \par \uc2 [\uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  keeps bullying Megyn Kelly on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , because \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 ]\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: No, I'm not. I've done meet and greets, but I don't care if anybody, you know, we have a small group where people, I guess, it's over here where people can send in, one woman sent in $7 and 30 some odd cents and wrote a beautiful letter, and people are sending in $10 and $20. And I like that kind it's not a lot of money ultimately, but I'm not doing anything about raising money. I don't care about raising money.\par \par \uc2 I mean, part of my thing is frankly, I'm not controlled by anybody. These other people are raising hundreds of millions of dollars. I could do that easily. I don't want to do that. It's not necessary for me to do that.\par \par \uc2 The one up in New Hampshire is just a small ticket item. And, by the way, they can come in free, they can do whatever they want. And for me, it's just a meet and greet. It's going to take place in New Hampshire and I think in Massachusetts, and it's just a very small situation and I don't consider it a fundraiser.\par \par \uc2 In fact, people don't have to pay. They're just people that have been supporting me from the beginning. They're terrific people. They want to see good things happen for our country.\par \par \uc2 So, I could do fundraisers and raise millions and millions of dollars and as you know, I haven't done that, nor do I want to, OK?\par \par \uc2 But I do meet and greet. I have to meet people and that's part of what I'm doing and I'll be in New Hampshire, I'll be in Massachusetts, I'll be in South Carolina, I'll be in Dallas in a couple of weeks. We're going to be all over. OK?\par \par \uc2 Yes?\par \par \uc2 REPORTER: President Obama has taken some tough questions from Jorge Ramos. Is there a reason why you won't?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Because he was out of order. I would take questions in two seconds but he stood up and started screaming.\par \par \uc2 REPORTER: Would you let him back in now?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I told you already, if he wants to come back in -- you can't stand up and scream. I was saying to somebody else to, is that correct? I was saying yes, and this guy stands up and starts screaming.\par \par \uc2 He's obviously a very emotional person. OK? So I have no problem with it. I don't know him. I have no idea, but I would certainly love to have questions from him.\par \par \uc2 Yes? Yes, sir? Go ahead.\par \par \uc2 REPORTER: I wanted to ask you, Secretary Clinton was here two weeks ago (INAUDIBLE)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Her college what?\par \par \uc2 REPORTER: Her college affordability plan --\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Yes.\par \par \uc2 We're coming out with a plan in about four weeks and I think it's going to make people very, very happy. We have so many people going all over the country. I've been asked so many times by students, what are we going to do?\par \par \uc2 You know, the ultimate question is create jobs, because the biggest problem is they have college debt. They have debt all over the place, right up to their neck and they come out and can't get a job in this country. Whether it's China or Japan or Mexico, they are all taking our jobs. We need jobs in our country. Enough with what we're doing with foreign trade.\par \par \uc2 So, I think that's one of the reasons we're leading by so much in the polls because know that I'm going to make good trade deals. It's not going to be this horrible situation where we get nothing.\par \par \uc2 You know, if you think about China, they took our jobs. They took our money. They took our base. They took our manufacturing and we owe them $1.4 trillion. How do you figure that? It's like a magic act.\par \par \uc2 We owe them $1.4 trillion right now. We owe Japan $1.4 trillion, same amount. Two countries and they sell cars to us by the millions. And we owe them money. How do you figure that?\par \par \uc2 So, we're going to turn that around. Yes?\par \par \uc2 REPORTER: The campaign, after all is said and done, cost about $1 billion for every candidate. You have a lot of money but ultimately, just $300 million in liquid assets, it's not --\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Well, you saw my income is almost $500 million a year. If I want to, I can do that.\par \par \uc2 At some point, the \uc2 Republican Party\uc2  once you get the nomination will kick in and a lot of money will come into the campaign, I would say.\par \par \uc2 REPORTER: Will you beholden into those interests?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I don't think so. I can tell you right now. In fact, I've told people I turned down and I sort of made that, I think I told you this last week, the week before last, a lobbyist a person, very good person came to me, offered $5 million, please, I want to give you $5 million for the campaign. I said I have no interest in taking that.\par \par \uc2 In fact, it's the first time I think he's ever been told down.\par \par \uc2 [18:55:00] He told me. I think it's the first time he's been turned down because I know this person, good person, smart, tough, he'll coming to me and saying in two years, in one year, in four years, he'll be representing a country, maybe a company or maybe a person, I'm not doing anything for him.\par \par \uc2 So, I said I don't want to embarrass you by taking your money and then saying, I'm not going to see you. I'm working for one thing, for the people, and we're going to make the country strong and rich and great, and I hate to say rich, but we're a poor nation. We owe now $19 trillion. It's actually much more than that but it's $19 trillion. We're going to get things back in shape. This country is going to be so strong and so great and you're going to be so proud of it. So when he offered $5 million, I know he's going to be coming and it will be adverse to the people of this country. So, I didn't take his money.\par \par \uc2 Yes, sir?\par \par \uc2 REPORTER: Governor Bush and immigration. Yesterday he was down by the border in Texas, he said your immigration is unrealistic and it would cost too much money and is not conservative, and he suggested (INAUDIBLE) an immigration policy --\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I watched him, by the way, and he had a very small crowd and very little enthusiasm. He is a low energy person. You need a lot of energy to get this country turned around, including immigration.\par \par \uc2 And the word immigration and illegal immigration you wouldn't be asking this question if it weren't for me, because when I came out and when I announced, I'm the one that started this whole thing, and I took a lot of flak the first two weeks and now everyone is apologizing to me.\par \par \uc2 I mean, people in this room are apologizing to me because I brought something up that's very, very serious. I brought up the crime. I brought up all of the things that happened since, including Kate who this wonderful person from San Francisco with an incredible family who I got to know a little bit, and Jamiel who was gunned down by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  and so many others.\par \par \uc2 The other day, in California, 66-year-old veteran, OK? 66-year- old veteran was raped, sodomized, beaten and killed by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . That's few of many. That's a big problem.\par \par \uc2 So, you ask the question Jeb Bush doesn't have a clue. He doesn't even have a clue. And if I weren't in this campaign, Jeb Bush would not talk about illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 If you remember, he said he come as an act of love. OK? Tell that to the families and there are many, many, many families who lost a loved one, act of love, OK?\par \par \uc2 No act of love. It's tough stuff, mean stuff and it's going to be taken care of. You know, a lot of the gangs that you see in Baltimore and St. Louis and Ferguson and Chicago, you know they are illegal immigrants. They are here illegally and they're rough dudes, rough people. They are going to be gone so fast if I win that your head will spin. They're going to be gone so fast. OK?\par \par \uc2 Yes, ma'am? Go ahead.\par \par \uc2 REPORTER: To your question --\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Right.,\par \par \uc2 REPORTER: -- where do you stand on funding for Alzheimer's right now --\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Right, sure. I'm very strong toward funding for Alzheimer's and helping -- it's a terrible situation and they haven't made much progress, unfortunately. But I'm very, very strong in trying to find an answer for Alzheimer's, big problem.\par \par \uc2 Yes, sir?\par \par \uc2 REPORTER: (INAUDIBLE)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: No, no, no, I didn't say -- I said TV, I said newspapers, I read "The Wall Street Journal", I read "\uc2 New York Times\uc2 ", I read many, many newspapers and I read many magazines, I even read especially "Time Magazine" this particularly week, you know why? Because I'm on the cover. That's why I read.\par \par \uc2 But I read a lot about that. I read -- and I have people that I like and people that I respect and it's a great place. You get a cross section of everybody because you see people you never have the opportunity to see or meet and from there go and decide what you want to do.\par \par \uc2 But go ahead.\par \par \uc2 REPORTER: (INAUDIBLE)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I do. I do they will be announced over the next two or three weeks.\par \par \uc2 REPORTER: (INAUDIBLE)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: That would be possible but to be honest, this country is in trouble. Infrastructure is crumbling, our roads, our bridges, our airports, we're in such trouble that I'm going to spend a lot of time here. We're going to fix our country.\par \par \uc2 Our bridges, 59 percent of our bridges are in trouble. Think -- whoever heard of that? I mean, in trouble. Serious trouble. We're going to fix our country. I'm going to spend a lot of time here in the United States.\par \par \uc2 Yes, sir?\par \par \uc2 REPORTER: (INAUDIBLE)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Well, I like Scott Walker. I've always liked him. And I supported him. I actually gave him quite a bit of money. I liked his fight. I liked his drive. And he actually came to my office six months ago and gave me a trophy, gave me a beautiful plaque and I thought that was very nice. And in the end, I think people see, though, that what is happening in Wisconsin, I love the people of Wisconsin. I know Wisconsin well. I have friends that live there and they are incredible people. But if you look at what is going on in Wisconsin, I think people saw that they have a $2.2 billion budget deficit, it was supposed to be a surplus of a billion. That's tremendous. They are borrowing to a point that nobody thought possible. They are ranked number 38 in the states, which isn't exactly a good ranking, better than others that are running but frankly it's not a good ranking and they have a lot of problems and there is a lot of division in the state to put it mildly. And I think people, I do like Scott but I think people have seen what's happened in the state and he was. You know, the first, when I first announced, I was second and he was first. I think it was a 10 percent and he was at 22 percent. Now I think I'm at 22 or 24 percent and he's at six percent. I think what happened is people have really looked seriously at what is going on in Wisconsin and that has not been helpful to him, unfortunately. Yes, go ahead.\par \par \uc2 (INAUDIBLE QUESTION)\par \par \uc2 Well, I do retweets and I mean, to a certain extent. I do. Yes. I think that's right. You want me to say no? I retweet. You know, I retweet for a reason, right? Go ahead.\par \par \uc2 [RESOLVED: \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  isn't very good at \uc2 Twitter\uc2 ]\par \par \uc2 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE) Christian vote during the primaries.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Yes.\par \par \uc2 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The Bible is your favorite book.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: That's right.\par \par \uc2 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Is there anyone in the bible that you really relate to that you -- that you look up to?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Nobody that I would compare to. It's actually a great question. I love the Bible. I love the Bible. I'm a Protestant. I'm a Presbyterian. I went to Sunday school. Dr. Norman Vincent Peale, "The Power of Positive Thinking" was my pastor. He was until this day one of the great speakers I've ever seen. You hated to leave church. You hated when the sermon is over. That's how great he was. Marble Collegiate Church. And I also had a church in Jamaica, Queens, when I grew up in Queens. And it was wonderful. First Presbyterian church of Jamaica. And I was there for years. And that's where I went to Sunday school.\par \par \uc2 And, you know, one of the things that's so incredible about the New Hampshire numbers is I lead with everybody. I lead with old, with young, as you saw, you saw it, everybody. But one of the groups I lead with substantially, evangelicals. And I've led in Iowa, too, with the evangelicals. Because they get it. They're incredible people that are really smart. And they want to see our country thrive. And, but the beautiful thing -- because it was such a comprehensive poll in New Hampshire and they just went over everything. \uc2 Tea Party\uc2  like leading by a lot. Moderates leading by a lot. Everybody. Literally, I think, I mean, you'll correct me if I'm wrong, but I led with every single group and by substantial numbers. So, I was very honored to lead but with the evangelicals. I love the evangelicals. Okay. Yes, good, absolutely. Good. Absolutely. Good to have you back. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you very much.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Okay.\par \par \uc2 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE QUESTION) -- full of empty promises.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Okay.\par \par \uc2 RAMOS: (INAUDIBLE) You cannot deny citizenship to the children. You cannot --\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Why do you say that?\par \par \uc2 RAMOS: You cannot do that.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Well, a lot of people think -- no, no, excuse me. A lot of people, no, no, but a lot of people think that's not right, that an act of Congress can do it. Now, it's possibly going to have to be tested in courts. But a lot of people think that if you come and you're on the other side of the border -- I'm not talking about Mexico. Somebody on the other side of the border. A woman is getting ready to have a baby, she crosses the border for one day, has the baby, all of a sudden for the next 80 years, hopefully longer but for the next 80 years we have to take care of the people. No, no, no, I don't think so. Excuse me, some of the greatest legal scholars -- and I know some of these television scholars agree with you. But some of the great legal scholars agree that that's not true. That if you come across -- excuse me, just one second.\par \par \uc2 RAMOS: You're not answering the question.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: No, no, I am answering. If you come across for one day, one day, and you have a baby, now the baby is going to be an American citizen. Excuse me. There are great legal scholars, the top, that say that's absolutely wrong. It's going to be tested. Okay?\par \par \uc2 RAMOS: How are you going to build a 1900-mile wall?\par \par \uc2 [19:05:05] TRUMP: Very easy. I'm a builder. That's easy. I build buildings that are -- can I tell you what's more complicated? What's more complicated is building a building that's 95 stories tall. Okay?\par \par \uc2 (INAUDIBLE QUESTION)\par \par \uc2 You think so? Really? I don't think so. A lot of people don't think so.\par \par \uc2 RAMOS: Over 40 percent of the people say there is (INAUDIBLE) --\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I don't believe that. Okay. You're right. I don't believe it. And the drugs come. I see them. They have pictures, they have everything, crawling over the fences which are, by the way, this high. I mean, you have fences that are not as tall as I am. They're coming by many different ways. But the primary way is being right through, right past our border patrols who, by the way, are tremendous people. And they can do the job, but they're told not to.\par \par \uc2 RAMOS: How are you going to deport 11 million (INAUDIBLE)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Here's what we're going to do. Ready? Okay.\par \par \uc2 RAMOS: Are you going to bring the army?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: No, no. Let me tell you. We'll going to do it in a very humane fashion. Believe me. I have a bigger heart than you do. We'll going to do it in a very humane fashion. The one thing we're going to do --\par \par \uc2 RAMOS: One question, is there one question I want to ask --\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Okay. The one thing we're going to start with immediately are the gangs, and the real bad ones, and you do agree there are some bad ones. Do you agree with that or do you think everyone is just perfect? No, no, no, I asked you a question. Do you agree with that? We have tremendous crime, we have tremendous problems -- I can't deal with this. Listen, we have tremendous crime, we have tremendously, we have some very bad ones. And I think you would agree with that, right? Okay. There's a lot of bad ones. Real bad ones. Because you know, they looked at some of the gangs -- excuse me.\par \par \uc2 They looked at some of the gangs in Baltimore, they looked at some of the gangs in Chicago, they looked even in Ferguson. They got some rough, illegal immigrants in those gangs. They're getting out. You mind if I send them out? Now, if they come from Mexico, do you mind if I send them back to Mexico? No, no, do you mind if I send them back to Mexico?\par \par \uc2 (INAUDIBLE)\par \par \uc2 Okay. Those people are out. They'll going to be out so fast. Your head will spin. All right? The rest we're going to do in a -- remember, you use the word, \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 RAMOS: No, I didn't use the word.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Okay. Well, you should use it. Because that's what the definition is.\par \par \uc2 RAMOS: No human being is illegal.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Okay. Well, when they cross the border from a legal standpoint, they're \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  when they don't have their papers. And I want to make it possible and I think you'll like this. This is the part you're going to like. I want these people, the good people, I want them to come back and I want them to get documentation and get so they become legal. It's going to be -- you know what it's called, management. So, you're not used to good management because you're always talking about government. Let me just tell you, wait, wait, wait, wait. Government is incompetent. Guys like Bush and some others that I won't name, they're incompetent people. They don't have it. They don't have it. I agree, they can't do it. But I'm a great manager. I know how to manage things. I hire unbelievable people. When I look at the vets, when I look at the VA, excuse me, when I look at the VA, we spend billions of dollars and people are treated horribly. Okay? Horribly. That will work great. What we're doing here will work great. And we want to get good people back in. And also -- let me just tell you --\par \par \uc2 RAMOS: Because you're not giving specifics about --\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I've given you specifics. Great management. And they'll going to hopefully come back in very soon. Okay. Another question. Wait. Yes, go ahead. Yes, sir.\par \par \uc2 RAMOS: Is there any specific change in the law you made to limit money in politics?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Money in politics. Well, I think there should be frankly more transparency. Because I see a guy like Jeb Bush with $114 million which is now higher and nobody even knows who put the money in. And they all control him like a little puppet. Okay? I know half the people. I mean, I don't know who they are because I can't find it out but as soon as they do, I will know most of them. They're friends of mine. I used to be there. I used to be the king of that. Okay? I know the system better than anybody. The fact is that whether it's Jeb or Hillary or any of them, they're all controlled by these people. And the people that control them are the special interests, the lobbyists and the donors and they're controlled.\par \par \uc2 You know what the nice part about me? I don't need anybody's money. I mean, if a woman sends me the $7, I take it because that's great, because she's investing in this country in a proper way, not an improper way. But I don't need the money. It's a beautiful thing. So, if I say that I don't want Ford building in this case in Mexico or somewhere else, in all fairness, China, I want them to build here, I am not going to be hit by the Ford lobby and by all the other lobbies that you know who they are better than I do. They're not going to hit me. Because they didn't give ten cents to my campaign because I don't want their money. So, it's very important.\par \par \uc2 RAMOS: But should it be limited legally --\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I don't know about the limits. I think the most important thing is transparency. You have to know who you're dealing with. And right now you don't. You don't. And I'm talking about PACs in all fairness. I have good friends who like to put money into PACs. Many friends, I have some enemies too, by the way. But I have many friends. They put money in PACs. And you need transparency. You need to know who is putting up what. So when they start making deals in a year or two years or three years, you know what is happening. Okay. How about one more question. Go ahead.\par \par \uc2 [19:10:20] UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Most of the illegal immigrants in this country are either criminals -- TRUMP: No, not at all. I never said that. No, I think most of them are good people. I love that question, because hopefully, maybe somebody -- no, I think most of them are very good people but they are here illegally and we're a country of laws and we're a country of borders. We have to have a border and we'll have a border and we'll have a wall and the wall is going to have a big beautiful door where people can some in legally and also where we can bring talented people. We need that in the Silicon Valley when somebody goes to \uc2 Harvard\uc2 , Yale, Princeton, the Wharton school of finance, we send them out as soon as they graduate. They can't stay here. It's ridiculous. They want to be here. So, then they go to their country wherever it may be, whether it's Asia, Mexico, wherever it may be and they compete against us. I don't want that. I'll have one more then, yes, ma'am? Go ahead.\par \par \uc2 (INAUDIBLE QUESTION)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Where?\par \par \uc2 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (INAUDIBLE) in the latest poll numbers, Governor Walker is leading 25 percent -- what do you make of those numbers?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: In Wisconsin? I really don't know. I mean, I haven't got there. I would think would win -- I would think would win Wisconsin. I mean, I have a great relationship with the people in Wisconsin but, you know, I haven't started. I haven't been thinking about Wisconsin right now and Governor Walker certainly has been. I don't know what the poll is. I know this, in Florida, they just came out with a poll and I'm at 28 and Bush is much lower and Senator Rubio who is a sitting senator is much, much lower. So I don't know. I think I'll do very well in Wisconsin. I think so. Yes? Yes? Yes, sir, go ahead. Ye, go ahead. Go ahead.\par \par \uc2 (INAUDIBLE QUESTION)\par \par \uc2 Well, he came up. He wants to support my campaign but then I said oh, gee, he said some negative things about me and then he comes up to my office two or three hours later, he wants to be part of my campaign. But, you know, he's the hedge fund guy and honestly, maybe the hedge fund guys won't like me too much. I know a lot about hedge fund. I also know how they are taxed better than he does. So maybe they won't because maybe they won't like me. You understand. But he came up. He came up and he wants to support me, he wanted to leave Walker to support me. But I didn't make it so easy for him. Okay. Go ahead.\par \par \uc2 (INAUDIBLE QUESTION) I don't know. Look, I have a lot of respect for Roger. We'll see. I mean, you know, maybe, maybe not. I really don't know. Look, I think they cover me terribly. FOX News, I think they cover me terribly and I'm winning by double digits in every poll. So I don't know. Maybe it matters, maybe it doesn't. I don't think I get good treatment from FOX. They certainly cover me a lot. Well, I'm being covered by everybody. I don't know. I don't know, I don't think so. Because I think they give me very bad treatment. I think FOX treats me terribly and a lot of the people that like me think they treat me terribly but I don't think, I mean, what?\par \par \uc2 Do you think I was asked nice, easy questions? The other guys are saying, what are you going to do about jobs? Another one saying, do you love God? I get these questions like, what is going on here. And yet, I won in every single poll of the debate. I won. I won from drudge. I won in "Time Magazine." I won all the -- everybody thought I won the debate but I certainly had the worst questions, the most unfair questions and you know, I like FOX. I like it. But no, I think they treat me very poorly. Yes, go ahead? Yes. I'll do that. I'll do that. Sure.\par \par \uc2 (INAUDIBLE QUESTION)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: The which?\par \par \uc2 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Late night tweeting about Megyn Kelly --\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Takes two seconds. You do a couple of tweets because when people treat me unfairly, I don't let them forget and maybe we should have more of that in this country and maybe the country wouldn't be pushed around so much. Go ahead.\par \par \uc2 RAMOS: You say you're going to win the Latino votes --\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I think so because I'm going to bring jobs back.\par \par \uc2 RAMOS: But the truth is, I've seen the polls, Univision polls says, 75 percent of the Latino --\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: How much am I suing Univision for right now? No, no, no, do you know the number? No, no, no, tell me. Tell me. Do you know the number? And you know you're part of the lawsuit. How much am I suing Univision for right?\par \par \uc2 RAMOS: The question is Mr. Trump --\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Wait, wait, wait.

Do you know how many Latinos work for me? Do you know how many Hispanics are working for me? Okay. They love me. They love me. Do you know how many Hispanics work for me? Thousands. Do you know how many have worked for me over the years? Tens of thousands. Here is what happens, once I win, you're going to see things happen. You know what they want? They want jobs. That's what they want. In Nevada, did you see the poll of the Hispanics in the state of Nevada? Did you see -- excuse me. Big Hispanic population. I wiped everybody out, Hispanic. I won the poll. Excuse me, I'm not talking Univision. I'm talking the only poll I saw, the one that came out which was in the state of Nevada, I wiped everybody out. I wiped them out with Hispanics. You saw that, right? Did you see it? Wait. Did you see it? Okay. He's an honest guy. Now I like him. Okay. You and I will talk. We'll going to be talking a lot over the years. We will. We will. Okay. Thank you everybody.\par \par \uc2 (INAUDIBLE QUESTION)\par \par \uc2 I think about it myself.\par \par \uc2 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Did you write --\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Very interesting because a lot of people have been asking me because in Alabama I got very high marks for a speech and I honestly feel and it's one of the things I'll talk about, I'm always on live television and if you're on live television every three or four days you got to say things different. You can't be on the same and give the same stories, right? I think about my speeches and I don't believe in teleprompters, although it's easy, huh, I'd like to go up and stand up and read a speech for half an hour and just leave. But you know what happens? You wouldn't have sold out crowds like we have outside.\par \par \uc2 You wouldn't have 30,000 people like we had in Alabama. You wouldn't have the crowd that we had the other night in New Hampshire. You just wouldn't have it. It's not the same. In fact, I jokingly say if you're running for president, you shouldn't be allowed to use teleprompters. So, I think about my speeches a lot. I think about what I'm going to say, but I essentially don't use notes, and I definitely don't read the speeches because I think it's much easier, but you know what happens, you don't have the same vibrant.\par \par \uc2 (INAUDIBLE QUESTION)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I do a lot of things by myself. People would be surprised. People are shocked at how smart I am, right? Okay. Thank you. Thank you.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020150829eb8q0048j\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 It's the "guilt by association" theory of how \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 's candidacy hurts Republicans' 2016 chances: Hispanics connect his strong anti-\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  stances to the rest of the party or its eventual nominee, undermining the GOP's concerted efforts to perform better among Hispanics voters since Barack Obama routed \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2  by 71 to 27 percent among the group in 2012.\par \par \uc2 And then on Tuesday night, Trump kicked the most influential Spanish-language newsman out of a press conference.\par \par \uc2 The only problem: It's not borne out in the polls -- at least at this early stage. In fact, a\u160\'00\'A0new Gallup poll casts doubt on Trump's damage to Republicans in a summer dominated by his candidacy; Hispanics clearly despise Trump, but they view other Republicans much more positively (or have no opinion at all).\par \par \uc2 Gallup's chart tells the story as well as anything:\par \par \uc2 These numbers back up other polling (which we highlighted earlier this week) that shows, even as Trump has lost support among non-white voters in a potential general election matchup with Hillary Clinton, Jeb Bush has actually gained ground.\par \par \uc2 Hispanics give Trump an anemic negative-51 net favorable rating (percentage favorable minus percentage unfavorable), with 65 percent of Hispanics holding unfavorable views and 14 percent favorable in combined polls from July to August. No other GOP candidate is even close to his level of unpopularity \u8212\'20\'14 Ted Cruz and Rick Perry are nearest at negative-7.\par \par \uc2 And here's the most surprising finding: six candidates are actually seen in a net-positive light -- most clearly Jeb Bush at +11 and \uc2 Marco Rubio\uc2  at +5. This, despite the fact that the GOP in 2012 lost the Hispanic vote by 44 points.\par \par \uc2 The trajectory of Gallup's data over time also suggests no Trump damage; comparing data from daily surveys from July and August, their surveys tracked no significant shifts in favorability for almost any GOP candidate. The exception was Bush, whose net favorability rating actually increased\u160\'00\'A0from plus-1 in July (28 percent favorable vs. 27 percent unfavorable) to +22 in August (41 vs. 19). It's worth noting that most of Gallup's August interviewing concluded before Bush used the term "anchor babies"\u160\'00\'A0to describe children of undocumented immigrants, which could undermine his moderate image on the issue.\par \par \uc2 [Monkey Cage: This chart explains how Trump's stand on immigration is hurting the \uc2 Republican Party\uc2 ]\par \par \uc2 So why hasn't Trump's strongly negative image with Hispanics damaged other Republicans? The obscurity of GOP contenders is one likely reason, as most Hispanics are not familiar enough with other Republican candidates to offer an opinion. Only 43 percent are familiar with \uc2 Marco Rubio\uc2 , despite his long run in the spotlight as a Cuban-American Republican involved in immigration reform efforts.\par \par \uc2 In addition, other polling shows Hispanics do not immediately ascribe\u160\'00\'A0Trump's comments to\u160\'00\'A0the \uc2 Republican Party\uc2  more broadly. Shortly after Trump's comments about immigrants from Mexico being "criminals," a large survey of Hispanic voters by Univision/Bendixen & Amandi found 61 percent of Hispanics saying Trump's comments only represent his viewpoint, while 32 percent said they also extend to the \uc2 Republican Party\uc2 . That's pretty remarkable, given Hispanics skew toward Democrats.\par \par \uc2 [Monkey Cage: Will Trump's view on immigration hurt the GOP? Maybe not.]\par \par \uc2 The Gallup poll is good news for Bush and other Republicans aiming to demonstrate appeal with Hispanic voters, but Romney's experience in 2012 shows how attitudes in the year before the election can change drastically. Romney's net favorability rating was +1 among Hispanics across three Post-ABC polls in late 2011, with 49 percent having no opinion -- quite similar to most candidates in Gallup's poll. By contrast, the 2012 exit poll showed Romney with a -49 rating among Hispanic voters (29 percent favorable, 68 percent unfavorable), which is almost as bad as Trump's rating today.\par \par \uc2 There's no telling whether the Republican nominee \u8212\'20\'14 assuming it's not Trump \u8212\'20\'14 will avoid Romney's big loss among Hispanics, but they aren't suffering from guilt by association with Trump. At least yet.\par \par \uc2 The Gallup poll was conducted July 8- Aug. 23 among a random national sample of Hispanic adults reached on landline and cellular phone numbers, with interviews conducted in English and Spanish. The sample size for favorable ratings on each candidate averages about 700 interviews, carrying a margin of sampling error of plus or minus five percentage points.\par \par \uc2 Peyton M.

I support the 14th Amendment. Nothing about what I've said should be viewed about derogatory towards immigrants at all."\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 Former Florida governor Jeb Bush (R), speaking in McAllen, Tex., Aug. 24, 2015\par \par \uc2 "How crazy \u8212\'20\'14 7.5% of all births in U.S. are to illegal immigrants, over 300,000 babies per year."\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 Donald Trump, in a tweet, Aug. 21\par \par \uc2 In trying to explain his recent remarks on so-called "anchor babies," former Gov. Jeb Bush said he was actually speaking about organized efforts to bring pregnant women into the United States, on legal visas, so they could give birth.\par \par \uc2 (The term "anchor baby" refers to the theory that having a child as a U.S. citizen makes it hard for an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  to be deported, but in reality more than 70,000 parents of U.S. citizens were deported in 2013. Our colleague Janell Ross wrote\u160\'00\'A0a detailed look at the "myth" of the anchor baby.)\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, his GOP rival, business executive Donald Trump, in a widely cited tweet decried the number of children who are born in the United States each year to illegal immigrants. Trump has called for denying birthright citizenship to children of illegal immigrants.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/634725641972248576"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/634725641972248576}}}\par \par \uc2 So what do the numbers show?\par \par \uc2 The Facts\par \par \uc2 First, we are dealing with estimates. But Trump is essentially correct that about\u160\'00\'A0300,000 children a year are born in the United States with at least one parent who is an undocumented immigrant.\par \par \uc2 In 2010, both the \uc2 Pew Research Center\uc2  and the \uc2 Center for Immigration Studies\uc2  estimated that more than 300,000 such children were born in the United States every year. Pew pegged the figure at 340,000 in 2008, while CIS gave a range of 300,000 to 400,000. Under the 14th\u160\'00\'A0Amendment of the Constitution, all were recognized as U.S. citizens at birth.\par \par \uc2 Pew estimated that four\u160\'00\'A0out of every five children born to at least one authorized immigrant parent were born in the United States, for a total of 4 million in 2009. That number has probably grown by an additional 2 million in the past six years. Birth rates have declined since the Great Recession, so it's possible the annual figure has dropped slightly below 300,000 (7.5 percent of 3.9 million births is about 294,000), but not by much.\par \par \uc2 With about 70 percent of undocumented immigrants coming from Mexico, El Salvador and Honduras, it's a safe bet that two-thirds of these children are born to parents with Latin American roots. The next biggest population of undocumented immigrants is from China, Philippines, India and Korea \u8212\'20\'14 but with just 8\u160\'00\'A0percent of the total, that's probably about 25,000 a year.\par \par \uc2 So what is Bush talking about? A spokesman says he is referencing an entirely different issue: women who come to the United States on tourist visas \u8212\'20\'14 and thus are on U.S. soil legally \u8212\'20\'14 but for the express purpose of having the child born in the United States.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2  wrote about the trend in 2010, noting that the regulations do not permit the State Department to refuse visas simply because a woman is pregnant. Rolling Stone magazine recently documented the case of a Chinese couple who paid $20,000 to be housed in a small hotel in Los Angeles while they were awaiting the birth of the child. The main motivation \u8212\'20\'14 ensuring the child could be educated in the United States.\par \par \uc2 How many women take this step? This is even more difficult to estimate. \uc2 Steven A. Camarota\uc2  of CIS in 2015 estimated the number of "birth tourists" was about\u160\'00\'A036,000, after comparing the data for the number of foreign-born mothers who gave birth during the year against the number of such women who showed up in the U.S. Census. The gap was almost 36,000, but he cautioned that it was a very rough estimate.\par \par \uc2 Camarota, in an interview, said the largest share of birth tourists was probably from East Asia, but many also came from Eastern Europe (such as Russia) and Nigeria. A report in Vice says that a handful of pregnant women board every flight from Moscow to Miami, which is apparently a popular spot for Russian birth tourists.\par \par \uc2 But The Huffington Post, quoting Chinese sources, said the total number of Chinese birth tourists is projected to be 60,000 in 2014, a sixfold increase over 2012 \u8212\'20\'14 apparently spurred on by a romantic comedy, "Finding Mr. Right," about a Chinese woman who flew to Seattle so she could have an American baby (and also go shopping).\par \par \uc2 "The conversation about immigrant families in the U.S.\u160\'00\'A0is typically centered around people from Latin America\u160\'00\'A0seeking economic opportunities in the States," The Huffington Post said. "But as incomes in China rise and visa hurdles fall, women from China are making up a larger share of foreign births in the U.S., and they're complicating many of the popular ideas about immigrant mothers."\par \par \uc2 Federal authorities recently conducted high-profile raids on businesses in southern California that charged up to $60,000 to arrange the tourist visas and provide housing in anticipation for the birth.\par \par \uc2 The Pinocchio Test\par \par \uc2 While precise figures are hard to come by, the number of children born to undocumented immigrants each year in the United States still easily outpaces the number of children born to\u160\'00\'A0women who come to the United States to give birth using a legal tourist visa. What is a more important issue is obviously a policy question beyond the purview of The Fact Checker.\par \par \uc2 But given the apparent surge of Chinese applicants, Bush is likely correct that most of the birth tourists are Asian. Meanwhile, Trump is correct that number of births to undocumented immigrants is about 300,000 a year.

In short, if the undocumented parent of a U.S.-born child is caught in the United States, he or she legally faces the very same risk of deportation as any other immigrant\u8230\'20\'26\par \par \uc2 But this is really an urgent problem that demands our immediate attention.\par \par \uc2 * Down, down, down:\par \par \uc2 Stock prices around the world continued to plunge on Friday, threatening to end one of the longest bull runs in the history of the United States stock market.\par \par \uc2 Naturally, some pundits are already suggesting that this is terrible news for \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 . \u8212\'20\'14 \uc2 gs\par \par \uc2 * Francis Wilkinson brings crucial context for understanding the GOP's lurch into birthright-citizenship mania, explaining that while we've gone through waves of anti-immigrant sentiment in America, this isn't actually one of them.\par \par \uc2 * Christopher Flavelle, who came to America to practice that sordid craft known as journalism, offers a nice personal look at how the birthright citizenship of his two children shaped his sense of what it means to be an immigrant \u8212\'20\'14 and how he feels about this country. \u8212\'20\'14 \uc2 gs\par \par \uc2 * Perry Bacon notes that despite being pulled right by \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  , Jeb Bush is still a genuine moderate on immigration in some key ways.\par \par \uc2 * James Downie has a question about the GOP candidates' rightward stampede behind \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  : Is Republicans' increasing confidence in \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 's alleged political weakness leading them to neglect caring about electability? \u8212\'20\'14 \uc2 gs\par \par \uc2 * Paul Krugman has an excellent column explaining why, contrary to what many people believe, government debt is actually a good and necessary thing.\par \par \uc2 * Guess what: There's yet another lawsuit trying to take down the Affordable Care Act, or a part of it anyway. This one is about reimbursements for cost-sharing expenses; Nicholas Bagley looks at what would happen if it were successful.\par \par \uc2 * Rep. Jerrold Nadler, whose support for the Iran agreement is a big deal, offers up a remarkably detailed analysis of the Iran nuclear deal in explaining his decision and responding in point-by-point fashion to its critics.\par \par \uc2 * At The Week, I argued that we shouldn't believe the Republican candidates when they say they'll abandon the Iran nuclear deal the day they take office.\par \par \uc2 * Gershom Gorenberg looks at how the politics of the Likud and the Republican Party are becoming increasingly intertwined.\par \par \uc2 * Ryan Cooper calls President Obama cowardly for failing to use his pardon power to release more federal prisoners who deserve to get out of jail.\par \par \uc2 * And Helaine Olen explains why Republicans' plans to cut Social Security benefits amount to an attack on women.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020150829eb8l0039l\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 THE BIG IDEA by Robert Costa: \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  is going to pack a college football stadium in Alabama on Friday night. The scene will be part Lynyrd Skynyrd concert, part tea-party rally. It'll also likely be the biggest event so far in the 2016 race. And there is nothing GOP leaders or his rivals can do about it.\par \par \uc2 Ladd-Peebles Stadium in Mobile, Ala., is one of the last places you'd expect a Republican presidential candidate to appear in late August before the primaries. This chapter of the contest is usually devoted to sleepy getting-to-know-you huddles at the \uc2 Pizza Ranch\uc2  in Pella, Iowa. But the sloped steel bowl near the Gulf Coast, just a short drive from the vote-rich Florida panhandle, is where the billionaire is planning to host more than 30,000 people.\par \par \uc2 Corey Lewandowski, Trump's campaign manager, called The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2  on Thursday to preview the event. He said Trump's goal is to start laying the groundwork for the swing of Southern primaries in March and for what could be a drawn-out nomination fight. "That's where we're looking," he said. "Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, and then be ready for the rest of the way."\par \par \uc2 The gathering under the Friday night lights, however, is not only a strategic move to round up signatures and e-mail addresses in the parking lot and in the bleachers. It is a sweaty political moment \u8212\'20\'14 the latest and largest spectacle in what has become the most colorful and bombastic campaign in American politics.\par \par \uc2 Trump, at least for now, has become an unstoppable force, hurtling through a field of 16 opponents with unbridled candor, brushing back swirling controversies and relishing the daily affection of top-flight network television bookers who have him on speed dial.\par \par \uc2 No one in the GOP seems to be able to figure how to deal with his staying power. In recent weeks, they've crossed their fingers and assured skittish donors that Trump would be a summer fling. Yet he still leads the polls and his numbers are rising in key states, all as others struggle mightily to get attention and hope to be recognized when they're strolling through the Iowa State Fair.\par \par \uc2 As Phil Rucker and I write today, the non-Trump candidates are falling into three categories: Those who are emulating and befriending him in an effort to win over his supporters; those who are assailing his background or calling him out for his views and rhetoric; and those who prefer to stay silent, as if hunkering down in the basement to ride out the tornado.\par \par \uc2 Tonight, that tornado comes to Alabama.\par \par \uc2 Programming note: James Hohmann is on vacation this week. Stay tuned for one more guest Big Idea from fellow Postie Paul Kane.\par \par \uc2 WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 President \uc2 Obama\uc2  wrote a letter to Congress asserting that the United State would unilaterally maintain economic pressure and reserve the option of military force against Iran if necessary, if his landmark nuclear accord with the country is implemented, the \uc2 New York Times\uc2  reported. The Aug. 19 letter is the first time that \uc2 Obama\uc2  has personally put such promises in writing as his administration aggressively sells the deal to lawmakers. Among the pledges is a separate office inside the State Department to implement the deal.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, a Post analysis showed that deal supporters are very unlikely to override a veto if Congress sends a disapproval resolution to the president's desk. Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill (Mo.) was the latest to throw her vote to the president on Thursday. Check outthis handy interactive chartlisting all the lawmakers' positions. But deal foes aren't giving up: a mad TV ad rush is on, with spots running in at least 23 states and all over social media.\par \par \uc2 GET SMART FAST:\par \par \uc2 * Hundreds of federal government employees \u8212\'20\'14 including in "sensitive" jobs in the White House and Congress \u8212\'20\'14 used their work computers to access and pay membership dues to the cheating website Ashley Madison, the Associated Press reported. Two dozen agencies were involved, including accounts traced to two assistant U.S. attorneys; a White House information technology officer; and a Homeland Security Department counter-terrorism aide.\par \par \uc2 * U.S. District Court Judge Emmet Sullivan told State Department attorneys they should be working with the \uc2 FBI\uc2  to see if \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  had retained any federal records on the private email server she used as secretary of state. Appointed by \uc2 Bill Clinton\uc2  , Sullivan said it wouldn't be an issue if Hillary "had followed government policy."\par \par \uc2 * July 2015 was the hottest month on record for planet Earth since the 1800s, and we're well on our way toward the hottest year on record globally.\par \par \uc2 * A new study by \uc2 Columbia University\uc2 's Earth Institute found that human-caused global warming increased the California drought by 25 percent. The state's drought is the worst in its history, and 2014 was also the state's hottest year.\par \par \uc2 * Greece will hold new elections on Sept. 20, as Prime Minister \uc2 Alexis Tsipras\uc2  attempts to consolidate his power and implement the harsh bailout plan, despite internal backlash.\par \par \uc2 POWER PLAYERS IN THE NEWS:\par \par \uc2 * Pols sent their prayers and well wishes to \uc2 Jimmy Carter\uc2  after he disclosed Thursday that cancer in his liver had spread to his brain. He started radiation treatment yesterday.\par \par \uc2 * A "feistier" Jeb Bush said he doesn't think the term "anchor babies" is offensive \u8212\'20\'14 Bush used the term for the first time on Wednesday. "What I said is that it's commonly referred to that. I didn't use it as my own language. You want to get to the policy for a second? I think that people born in this country ought to be American citizens." By contrast, \uc2 Marco Rubio\uc2  said in an interview that children born in the U.S. to \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  are "human beings."\par \par \uc2 * And \uc2 Rand Paul\uc2  joined the chorus of Republicans who want to end birthright citizenship \u8212\'20\'14 except that he had the idea way before \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  . Paul sponsored a 2011 resolution that would have changed the law to limit birthright citizenship to only those kids born to at least one parent who is a legal U.S. citizen, resident alien or member of the Armed Forces. It went nowhere.\par \par \uc2 * Trump's one-hour \uc2 CNN\uc2  interview on Wednesday night gave the network it's biggest ratings at 9p.m. since anti-police riots in Baltimore on April 28.\par \par \uc2 * Former presidents George W. Bush and \uc2 Bill Clinton\uc2  will visit New Orleans, along with President \uc2 Obama\uc2  , during the week-long commemoration of the 10-year anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. \uc2 Obama\uc2  visits on Aug. 27, Bush goes on the 28th and Clinton on the 29th.\par \par \uc2 * Retired basketball star Charles Barkley said he's looking at John Kasich at this point in the race.\par \par \uc2 * It's looking increasingly likely that Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell (R) will go to prison while awaiting his appeal to the \uc2 U.S. Supreme Court\uc2  . McDonnell can appeal to SCOTUS to stay out of jail during the appeals process, but it's more likely he'll be given a date to report to prison within a week.\par \par \uc2 * Carly Fiorina 's dad, Joseph Sneed, was on the three-judge panel that picked a Whitewater special counsel \u8212\'20\'14 it was Sneed who recommended Kenneth Starr for the job, our Loop colleague \uc2 Colby Itkowitz\uc2  reports.\par \par \uc2 WAPO HIGHLIGHTS:\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14"\uc2 Obama\uc2  's ever-shrinking, nearly invisible Martha's Vineyard vacation," by Greg Jaffe: "For almost two weeks here, \uc2 Obama\uc2  has brought that same minimalist ethic to his vacation. Now in his sixth year of visits to the island \u8212\'20\'14 he took one year off to run for reelection \u8212\'20\'14 the president is the equivalent of a vacationing Yeti. Many have had near brushes with the leader of the free world, but only a precious few have actually laid eyes on him. For some on the Vineyard, who insist that the island is simply too sophisticated for celebrity spotting, \uc2 Obama\uc2  's near-invisibility is a point of pride\u8230\'20\'26The reality, though, is that the president's vacation has \u8212\'20\'14 with each passing year \u8212\'20\'14 grown smaller and smaller. So small, in fact, that it can barely be seen. Early in his presidency \uc2 Obama\uc2  made regular visits with his wife and daughters to the Bunch of Grapes bookstore in Tisbury to load up on reading. But those brief jaunts fell off the schedule a couple of years ago."\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14"For Carly Fiorina , just 'press one' to solve the nation's problems," by Jenna Johnson: "The former Hewlett-Packard chief executive has been telling audiences in Iowa and elsewhere on the campaign trail recently that a mix of common sense \u8212\'20\'14 combined with her business know-how \u8212\'20\'14 would yield solutions to issues ranging from securing the border to simplifying tax rates to defeating the \uc2 Islamic State\uc2  terrorist group. 'A lot of this isn't complicated,' Fiorina said at a recent town hall [in Iowa], adding: 'Pretty basic.'" She explained to a veteran who complained he was having trouble scheduling a Veterans Administration doctor's appointment that she'd fix the problem by gathering a bunch of veterans in a room and vetting their solutions through a telephone poll. She said: "You know how to solve these problems. So I'm going to ask you."\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14"\uc2 FAA\uc2  records detail hundreds of close calls between airplanes and drones," by Craig Whitlock: "Before last year, close encounters with rogue drones were unheard of. But as a result of a sales boom, small, largely unregulated remote-control aircraft are clogging U.S. airspace, snarling air traffic and giving the \uc2 FAA\uc2  fits.\u160\'00\'A0Pilots have reported a surge in close calls with drones: nearly 700 incidents so far this year, according to \uc2 FAA\uc2  statistics, about triple the number recorded for all of 2014. The agency has acknowledged growing concern about the problem and its inability to do much to tame it\u8230\'20\'26documents show that remote-control planes are penetrating some of the most guarded airspace in the country."\par \par \uc2 SOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ:\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 ZIGNAL VISUAL: Jeb Bush's day was dominated by something he probably didn't want to talk about, according to our analytics partner \uc2 Zignal Labs\uc2 : "anchor babies," the term used by some for undocumented immigrants who come to the U.S. to have babies who then gain U.S. citizenship.\par \par \uc2 Pictures of the day:\par \par \uc2 An early evening storm produced beautiful and dramatic skies around Washington:\par \par \uc2 Lawmakers circulated the image below after President Carter said cancer has spread to his brain:\par \par \uc2 James Carter\uc2  , President Carter's grandson, posted this photo from Plains, Ga.:\par \par \uc2 And \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  made the cover of Time magazine:\par \par \uc2 Tweets of the day:\par \par \uc2 "Anchor babies" should be called babies, children or citizens, \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  tweeted:\par \par \uc2 Se llaman "beb\u233\'00\'E9s," "ni\u241\'00\'F1os," o "ciudadanos." {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://t.co/ofxEG6Za00"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://t.co/ofxEG6Za00 }}}\par \par \uc2 Bobby Jindal announced plans to screen the \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2  videos outside the governor's mansion:\par \par \uc2 We will play the videos on a screen outside the LA Gov.

Shaye Haver will make history Friday when she and another female soldier (Capt. Kristen Geist) become the first women to graduate from Ranger School, the Army's most physically demanding course. The 25-year-old helicopter pilot wasn't out to make a statement. What motivated her was winning the respect of her Ranger teammates by meeting the same challenges they did. 'We kind of were winning hearts and minds as we went,' Hayer said Thursday, explaining that they won the respect of other students by carrying their own weight on grueling patrols and meeting the tough physical standards."\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14\uc2 New York Times\uc2  , "Western wildfires consume manpower and acreage," by Kirk Johnson and Fernanda Santos: "The nation entered its eighth day on Thursday on what is officially known as Preparedness Level 5, which signifies that fire managers are struggling to find enough crews and commanders for the fires that are burning, most of them in parched Northwestern states and in Northern California. It is the highest such classification and also the first time since 2013 that it has been applied. In 2013, it was in effect for seven days. More acres have burned so far this year \u8212\'20\'14 about 7.2 million by Thursday, an area almost five times the size of the state of Delaware \u8212\'20\'14 than in each of the previous 10 years, according to statistics compiled by the National Interagency Fire Center. Two-thirds of those acres are in Alaska, which is having a particularly punishing fire season and is contending with mudslides caused by torrential rains on the denuded land."\par \par \uc2 HOT ON THE LEFT\par \par \uc2 McCaskill: Ex-senator \uc2 Scott Brown\uc2  would 'do anything to show his body.'

It was so surreal, all of the women in the Senate used to talk about how he would figure out some way, every time he had a conversation, to work in something about his body. Like, 'I was on the treadmill in the gym this morning and I saw you on MSNBC ,' or 'You know, I was running at lunch today and' \u8212\'20\'14 and he did it to all of us!

From the Daily Caller: "A group of influential Muslims is calling on others of their faith to wage a jihad on global warming, and is calling on Islamic governments to reduce their use of fossil fuels ahead of the United Nations climate summit in Paris this year. 'Excessive pollution from fossil fuels threatens to destroy the gifts bestowed on us by God, whom we know as Allah \u8212\'20\'14 gifts such as a functioning climate, healthy air to breathe, regular seasons, and living oceans,' wrote Islamic leaders from 20 countries after attending a summit in Istanbul, Turkey."\par \par \uc2 DAYBOOK:\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14What's happening today on the campaign trail:\u160\'00\'A0Ted Cruz will speak at the Des Moines Register's soapbox at the Iowa State Fair and hold a rally in Des Moines.

\par\par \uc2 the-fix\par {\*\bkmkstart toc35}{\*\bkmkend toc35}\b \uc2 The myth of the 'anchor baby' deportation defense ; Its a politically valuable but largely inaccurate idea.\b0\par\par\uc2 By Janell Ross   \par \uc2 1,363 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 August 2015\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2015, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Donald Trump said it; Jeb Bush said it, too.\par \par \uc2 Frankly, a whole range of people have used the term "anchor baby" this week in public discussions about Trump's immigration-related policy ideas -- ideas that include an end to the nearly 150-year-old practice of granting citizenship to anyone born in the United States.\par \par \uc2 It's the former, known as "birthright citizenship," which is delineated in the 14th Amendment to the Constitution. And as all sorts of public figures have discussed the future of the 14th Amendment this week, the more colloquial -- many say pejorative -- term "anchor baby" has come up over and over again.\par \par \uc2 But the anchor baby, while potent politically, is a largely mythical idea.\par \par \uc2 Here's the basic concept: People, namely women, come to the United States illegally and give birth to children, generally\u160\'00\'A0for the specific purpose of bolstering legal attempts of the child's parents remain in the United States or even become citizens themselves.\par \par \uc2 Looser definitions suggest "anchor babies" can simply be intended\u160\'00\'A0to help\u160\'00\'A0\uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2  parents access taxpayer-financed public education and/or social services through their citizen children -- another political hot button, to be sure. (Even here,\u160\'00\'A0the law limits those benefits to the children themselves.)\par \par \uc2 But\u160\'00\'A0usually\u160\'00\'A0the debate has been about the residency\u160\'00\'A0of the parents, who after all are supposed to be using the child as their "anchor."\par \par \uc2 This is the definition that has little legal underpinning.\u160\'00\'A0For \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  parents, being the parent of a U.S. citizen child almost never forms the core of a successful defense in an immigration court. In short, if the undocumented parent of a U.S.-born child is caught in the United States, he or she legally faces the very same risk of deportation as any other immigrant.\par \par \uc2 The only thing that a so-called anchor baby can do to assist either of their undocumented parents involves such a long game that it's not a practical immigration strategy, said\u160\'00\'A0Greg Chen, an immigration law expert and director of The American Immigration Lawyers Association, a trade group that also advocates for immigrant-friendly reforms. That long game is this: If and when a U.S. citizen reaches the age of 21, he or she\u160\'00\'A0can then apply for a parent to obtain a visa and green card and eventually enter the United States legally.\par \par \uc2 In order to apply for such an option, the parent of a so-called anchor baby would need to do all of the following.\par \par \uc2 * Wait for his or her\u160\'00\'A0child to reach the age of 21.\par \par \uc2 * Leave the United States.\par \par \uc2 * Return to their home country.\par \par \uc2 * Have their child begin the lengthy process of applying for a family reunification immigration request.\par \par \uc2 * Clear consular interviews and a \uc2 U.S. State Department\uc2  background check. (One or both would very likely provide evidence that said parent, at some point, lived in the United States illegally -- long enough for that "anchor baby" to be conceived or born. And despite widespread belief to the contrary, there is indeed a penalty for that.)\par \par \uc2 If a person has lived in the United States unlawfully for a period of more than 180 days but less than one year, there is an automatic three-year bar on that person ever reentering the United States -- and that's before any wait time for a visa. So that's a minimum of 21 years for the child to mature, plus the three-year wait.\par \par \uc2 And, for the vast majority of these parents, a longer wait also\u160\'00\'A0applies. If a person has lived in the United States illegally for a year or more, there is a 10-year ban on that person reentering the United States. So, in that case, there would be the 21-year wait for the child to mature to adulthood, plus the 10-year wait.\par \par \uc2 All told, the parents of the so-called anchor baby face a 24-to-31-year wait to even enter the United States, much less obtain a visa and green card or become a citizen.\par \par \uc2 Want proof?\u160\'00\'A0See Sections 212(a)(9)(i) and 212 (a)(9)(ii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA)\u160\'00\'A0-- or spend an afternoon in your nearest, severely backlogged immigration court.\par \par \uc2 [Immigration Court backlog grows to more than 450,000 cases]\par \par \uc2 Immigration courts routinely reject claims that an undocumented parent must remain in the United States to care for a U.S. citizen child. The main but rare\u160\'00\'A0legal exceptions are for children who are so seriously ill or profoundly disabled that one parent must care for them full-time, or for a child in need of medical care unavailable in their parents' home country.\par \par \uc2 These parents are given something called "humanitarian parole," Chen explained. And this is\u160\'00\'A0very rarely applied to people already living in the United States illegally. It is more often given to the parents of, say, an Afghan war burn victim who want to accompany their child to the United States for medical care. And, even then, humanitarian parole is generally granted for limited period of time.\par \par \uc2 Alternatively, these parents can apply for something even more rare: an extreme hardship exception, according to Deborah Anker, a clinical professor of law and director of the Harvard University Law School's immigration and refugee clinical program.\u160\'00\'A0Very rarely they can apply for a waiver that may allow them to reenter the United States sooner, Anker said. But if that request is denied, there is no form of appeal available. Decisions are final.\par \par \uc2 Yes, it is true that some undocumented immigrants come to the United States and have children with or perhaps even because of the mistaken belief that this will strengthen a legal bid to remain in the United States. Mistaken beliefs have spurred previous surges in illegal immigration -- including last year's.\par \par \uc2 And it is true that some people -- such as breast-feeding mothers, children brought to the United States illegally as children and others -- have benefited from the immigration system equivalent of proprietorial discretion, known as "deferred action."\par \par \uc2 But with the exception of an\u160\'00\'A0Obama administration program known as DACA (limited to an estimated 1.2 million young adults brought to the United States illegally as children) and a second program\u160\'00\'A0currently blocked by a federal court\u160\'00\'A0that would have granted deferred action to another 300,000 people (mostly the parents of those eligible for DACA), deferred actions typically come with a short and limited timeline. They also do not include a pathway to a visa or legal work in the United States. And these programs did not exist when the concept of an\u160\'00\'A0"anchor baby" was politically popularized, so it becomes harder to accept the idea that\u160\'00\'A0having an "anchor baby" was the express goal of\u160\'00\'A0many people immigrating illegally.\par \par \uc2 [Obama administration stops work on second immigration program]\par \par \uc2 It's also important to note that, as of August 2014, only about 550,000 DACA applications had been approved, according to a Pew research Center analysis of federal data. And\u160\'00\'A0even these applicants must wait until their 21st birthday to begin the lengthy process described above to attempt to help an undocumented parent. And "attempt" is the key word here.\par \par \uc2 And if you're still skeptical, here's the real proof that having a baby in the United States does little to help an undocumented parent remain in the United States, there's this:\par \par \uc2 In 2011, there were at least 5,000 children in state custody or foster care because an undocumented parent or parents has been deported, according to a study released by the \uc2 Applied Research Center\uc2 , a New York-based think tank that focuses on racial and social justice issues. Some estimates put that figure even higher today. Immigration and Customs Enforcement sent mandatory reports to the Senate that among other things revealed that during 2013, the agency deported 72,410 people who told federal authorities they have one or more U.S. citizen children.\par \par \uc2 Each of these children and their parents certainly know the "anchor baby" is not real.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020150829eb8l002wg\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 the-fix\par {\*\bkmkstart toc36}{\*\bkmkend toc36}\b \uc2 Just how revolutionary is Trump's immigration plan? It looks a lot like the GOP's. ; Not very. In fact, most of it should sound familiar.\b0\par\par\uc2 By Janell Ross   \par \uc2 991 \uc2 words\par \uc2 20 August 2015\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2015, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 's big immigration plan has been described alternatively as a "good start," "clueless" and havoc-inducing. And, at least one other candidate, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, co-signed what may the Trump plan's most controversial and improbable feature: putting an end to automatic U.S. citizenship at birth.\par \par \uc2 [Republicans want to change the 14th Amendment but that requires war, crisis or death]\par \par \uc2 One thing that hasn't been said, though, is that Trump's immigration plan hews pretty closely to the \uc2 Republican Party\uc2 's existing platform, its official plank of policy ideas. With one large exception, much of Trump's huge immigration plan should sound quite familiar.\par \par \uc2 Let's dig into the details.\par \par \uc2 Citizenship\par \par \uc2 * Trump's plan calls for an end to birthright citizenship and opposes a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 * The GOP's platform is mute on this idea. The party, though, says it is opposed to any form of "amnesty," which many Republicans would say a path to citizenship represents.\par \par \uc2 Restricting legal immigration\par \par \uc2 * Trump's plan calls for much more limited legal immigration to the United States, although on Wednesday Trump seemed to roll this idea back a bit to a point more in line with the GOP. Trump said foreigners who attend U.S. schools to study technology, engineering, math and science should be encouraged to stay.\par \par \uc2 * The GOP's ideas include "strategic immigration," granting more visas to people with advanced degrees in science, technology, engineering and math\u160\'00\'A0and encouraging foreign students who attend U.S. schools to stay. Why? According to the platform, these people are "[h]ighly skilled, English speaking and integrated into their communities, they are too valuable a resource to lose."\par \par \uc2 How to deal with undocumented employees\par \par \uc2 Trump\u160\'00\'A0would ...\par \par \uc2 * Force American employers to first attempt to fill all jobs with American workers. (This is already the law.)\par \par \uc2 * Force employers who do bring in high-skilled foreign workers to pay them more than they earn right now, eliminating the incentive to hire foreign workers.\par \par \uc2 * Create criminal penalties for people who overstay a visa.\par \par \uc2 * Require employers to use e-verify, a system to check eligibility to work in the United States.\par \par \uc2 The GOP\u160\'00\'A0would...\par \par \uc2 * Make e-verify use mandatory for employers.\par \par \uc2 * Create tough penalties for those who use fake IDs, steal them or traffic human beings.\par \par \uc2 Deportation, detention and more\par \par \uc2 Trump\u160\'00\'A0would ...\par \par \uc2 * Deport all undocumented immigrants who entered the country illegally or overstay visas.\u160\'00\'A0Trump told reporters this week that U.S.-born children will have to leave with their undocumented parents. But his administration would "work with them."\par \par \uc2 * Detain people caught attempting to cross the border. The same goes for illegal immigrants who commit crimes inside the United States: Return all of them to their home countries.\par \par \uc2 The GOP\u160\'00\'A0would ...\par \par \uc2 * Create "humane procedures" to encourage illegal immigrants to self-deport\par \par \uc2 * Deport those who have overstayed their visas\par \par \uc2 * Give the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2  the authority to detain illegal immigrants long-term, particularly those who are "dangerous but un-deportable."\par \par \uc2 Border security\par \par \uc2 Trump\u160\'00\'A0would ...\par \par \uc2 * Build a wall between the United States and Mexico.\par \par \uc2 * If Mexico won't cover the bill for that wall, deduct it from foreign aid, seize money illegal workers send to Mexico from the United States, impose trade tariffs, and charge higher fees for visas, short-term U.S. entry and work permits.\par \par \uc2 * Spend more money and put more people to the task of immigration law enforcement and border security.\par \par \uc2 The GOP\u160\'00\'A0would ...\par \par \uc2 * Complete the existing double-layer fencing project at the border.\par \par \uc2 * Secure the rule of law both at our borders and at ports of entry.\par \par \uc2 Domestic law enforcement and other changes\par \par \uc2 Trump\u160\'00\'A0would ...\par \par \uc2 * Increase\u160\'00\'A0cooperation between local police departments' anti-gang units and immigration officers. That work should inform deportation cases brought against \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  gang members\u160\'00\'A0and\u160\'00\'A0those with DUIs and other criminal convictions.\par \par \uc2 * Withhold federal dollars from sanctuary cities.\par \par \uc2 * End federal lawsuits against states accused of violating the Constitution in their efforts to address illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 The GOP\u160\'00\'A0would ...\par \par \uc2 * Strengthen ties, including standing agreements already allowed under federal law, between local police departments and federal immigration authorities to detain and deport more of the country's \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  population.\par \par \uc2 * Withhold federal funds from sanctuary cities.\par \par \uc2 * Withhold federal funds from colleges and universities charging undocumented students in-state tuition rates.\par \par \uc2 * End federal lawsuits against states accused of violating the Constitution in their efforts to address illegal immigration\par \par \uc2 What's the difference?\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Republican Party\uc2 's official platform does not call for an end to birthright citizenship \u8212\'20\'14 or, more specifically, repealing the constitutional amendment that, following the Civil War, assured equal legal status to former slaves and their former masters.\par \par \uc2 The party's plan does seem to put more emphasis on encouraging English-speaking and assimilation than Trump's. But Trump's calls for increasing fees, imposing possible tariffs and withholding aid from one of the United States' major trading partners. Those are all things the party's platform does not do.\par \par \uc2 Trump wants to see a mass and mandatory deportation program with unspecified aid to families with U.S.-born children. The party has called for mass self-deportation with "humane" parameters. Trump's plan does call for domestic job programs for the unemployed.\par \par \uc2 Oh, and Trump wants a wall. The party wants that double-layer fence.\par \par \uc2 Other than that, most of Trump's big ideas are included in the GOP's 2012 policy platform, the party's current position document.\par \par \uc2 Internally, the party has already begun discussions about what will and will not be in the 2016 platform. Among the big questions: Will the party and its many, many presidential candidates move in the direction of Trump's ideas? Or will Trump do something really huge and get in line with the party?\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020150829eb8k002pr\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

What could go wrong? \b0\par\par\uc2 By Greg Sargent   \par \uc2 814 \uc2 words\par \uc2 19 August 2015\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2015, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 NBC News' First Read crew tallies up where the 2016 GOP candidates stand on \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 's call for an end to birthright citizenship for the children of illegal immigrants, and marvels at the degree to which it's already setting the agenda in the GOP primary:\par \par \uc2 Maybe the most significant storyline over the last 72 hours has been the discussion that \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  started when he unveiled his immigration plan \u8212\'20\'14 ending birthright citizenship for the children of undocumented immigrants born in the United States. The GOP field is divided: Trump, Paul, Santorum, Graham, Christie, Carson and Jindal are in favor of ending birthright citizenship; Bush and Rubio are opposed; Kasich has flip-flopped (used to support it and now opposes it); and Scott Walker appeared to support but also appeared to walk it back.\par \par \uc2 We doubt it, too. Yet here we are. The question is: Why are so many Republican candidates (seven, by NBC's count) signaling, at a minimum, an openness to ending birthright citizenship? Where are Republican primary voters on this?\par \par \uc2 There is very little polling out there, but WaPo's crack polling director Peyton Craighill turned up this Fox News poll from 2010:\par \par \uc2 Under current law, any child born in the United States is a citizen of the United States. If an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  has a baby while living in the United States, do you think the child should automatically become a U.S. citizen, or not?\par \par \uc2 Sixty-three percent of Republicans say No. The public overall is much more closely divided, with 50 percent saying No and 47 percent saying Yes. A Pew poll from 2010 also found a split public, with 49 percent favoring keeping the Constitution as it is on birthright citizenship and 46 percent wanting a change.\par \par \uc2 So the public may be far more divided on this than we might have expected or hoped. But the 14th amendment isn't going to get changed, and for political purposes, what really matters are the views of two groups of voters: Republicans, and Hispanics. Birthright citizenship won't be a major motivator for swing voters; the political question is whether GOP support for ending it will further alienate Latinos; and whether the views of GOP primary voters will force the GOP candidates to adopt positions that deepen that hole among Latinos for the party and for the eventual nominee.\par \par \uc2 Some of the GOP candidates, at least, feel obliged to follow Trump on birthright citizenship, and perhaps they think GOP primary voters want to hear them do that, as the Fox poll seems to indicate. But the truth is that it has been maddeningly difficult to figure out where Republican voters are on immigration, and relatedly, what's fueling the rise of Trump. Polls have shown solid majorities of Republicans agree with Trump's comments about Mexican immigrants, trust Trump to handle immigration, and more generally think deporting undocumented immigrants (as Trump has vowed to do en masse) should be a key focus of government policy. But other polls have shown surprisingly large percentages of Republican voters favor legalization. So it's hard to say what's going on here. It's perfectly possible that Trump's rise has little to do with voter agreement with him on the specifics. It's also possible a lot of voters simply do agree with some of what he's saying. We just don't know yet.\par \par \uc2 Given all the evidence we have, perhaps the most likely explanation is that a sizable chunk of Republican voters likes the general story Trump is telling about immigration and the economy. As \uc2 Jonathan Chait\uc2  noted, Trump is concocting a Pat-Buchanan-like brew of economic and cultural nationalism that taps into the economic anxieties of white working class Republicans. The broader story he is telling is that immigration is the cause of people's economic suffering. Some of his GOP rivals, at least, seem to think this tale is potent enough to require them to hew not just to it, but also to Trump's specific prescriptions.\par \par \uc2 The salutary result of this is that we're actually seeing a debate about concrete immigration policies underway among Republicans. The less salutary aspect of it is that Trump seems to be setting the agenda for that debate. Hopefully that will eventually bring us some clarity as to where Republican voters really are on the policies (such as they are) that Trump is offering, and on the real reasons for his surprising surge.\par \par \uc2 ****************************************************************\par \par \uc2 UPDATE: It's possible that the two polls I cited above show a divided public on birthright citizenship because the questions lean heavily on the phrase "\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 ." Another poll from 2011 found that 62 percent of Americans oppose changing the Constitution's provision on birthright citizenship.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020150829eb8j002ft\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 the-fix\par {\*\bkmkstart toc38}{\*\bkmkend toc38}\b \uc2 The history of \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 's presidential campaign, as told by \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  ; Written by one of the great memories of all time.\b0\par\par\uc2 By Amber Phillips   \par \uc2 913 \uc2 words\par \uc2 19 August 2015\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2015, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Nobody knows \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 's presidential campaign better than the man himself.\u160\'00\'A0And in a lengthy interview with Janice Min of the Hollywood Reporter\u160\'00\'A0for an Aug. 28 cover story, Trump took the opportunity to clarify some things \u8212\'20\'14 and revise a few bits of history (as he is wont to do).\par \par \uc2 He's been unfairly attacked, you see. His past has been prodded and completely misconstrued. And basically everyone who was wrong about him has called him personally to apologize.\par \par \uc2 It's a pretty striking interview \u8212\'20\'14 Trump at his most Trump-y. And it made us wonder: How would \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  tell the story of \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 's presidential campaign? We think it might look a little something like this (with direct quotes from the man himself):\par \par \uc2 Before \uc2 Donald J. Trump\uc2  even officially announced he was running for president, his relationship with NBC was beginning to crumble.\par \par \uc2 Trump severed ties with NBC "out of respect" due to his impending presidential bid. NBC executives really wanted him to continue another season of Trump's massive hit reality TV show, "The Apprentice," and Trump just didn't want to do it. \u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 "They were very angry that I didn't do it," he said.\par \par \uc2 Executive Producer Mark Burnett and other network big shots\u160\'00\'A0tried to talk Trump out of turning down another season of a lucrative and very, very successful reality TV show, calling him and visiting him in his office to plead for him to continue "The Apprentice." But Trump swatted away their requests. He had a job to do, and that was to Make America Great Again (TM).\par \par \uc2 One of Trump's most pivotal moments in the campaign so far came within minutes of his announcement\u160\'00\'A0that he was\u160\'00\'A0running for president. During that June 16 announcement at New York City's Trump Towers, a luxurious and classy building, he\u160\'00\'A0made the now-famous comment pointing out that\u160\'00\'A0illegal Mexican immigrants were rapists and murderers who were sent across the border by the Mexican government. He added:\u160\'00\'A0"And some, I assume, are good people."\par \par \uc2 A backlash ensued. America's largest Spanish-language TV station, Univision, decided not to carry the Miss Universe pageant, which Trump sponsors. But it was no big deal. Miss Universe, the classy pageant where the world's most beautiful women parade around on stage in bikinis, has terrible ratings compared to "The Apprentice." "The Apprentice's" ratings are yuge. YUGE.\par \par \uc2 Other\u160\'00\'A0fallout was similarly swift but minor for Trump. Macy's CEO Terry Lundgren decided not to carry Trump's line of suits, shirts and ties, which many observers considered a rash and impractical decision that was very disloyal to the Trump brand. Many people told him that.\par \par \uc2 As news reports slammed him, Trump went through, in his own words, not "a pleasant period." He had lost business after all, and as a very successful and wealthy businessman, that's never easy.\par \par \uc2 But on July 1, a tragic accident vindicated Trump's focus on criminal illegal immigrants: Thirty-two-year-old Kate\u160\'00\'A0Steinle\u160\'00\'A0was shot and killed in San Francisco reportedly by\u160\'00\'A0an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who had been deported back to Mexico five times.\par \par \uc2 Suddenly the Macy's CEO, the NBC executives \u8212\'20\'14 and most of all, the voters \u8212\'20\'14 realized that Trump had been right all along.\u160\'00\'A0 In the aftermath of Steinle's death, "everybody" in the news business called Trump to apologize for writing and taping and publishing and tweeting critical stories about him.\par \par \uc2 Trump was not immune to criticism, though. Media mogul \uc2 Rupert Murdoch\uc2  has called Trump "embarrassing" and has routinely bashed Trump\u160\'00\'A0in a series of tweets. But as Trump has risen in the polls in recent weeks, Murdoch has noticeably stepped back his criticism on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 . Sources say Murdoch has reported to his aides that Trump is doing a great job and that he is "very impressed" with what Trump is saying on the campaign trail.\u160\'00\'A0 Another media legend is Matt Drudge, who is also very impressed with Trump's campaign.\par \par \uc2 Trump, though, soon found himself embroiled in another controversy. During the first\u160\'00\'A0Republican presidential debate, Fox News host Megyn Kelly asked Trump why he had called women like Rosie O'Donnell and Arianna Huffington various nasty\u160\'00\'A0names \u8212\'20\'14 things like "fat pig."\par \par \uc2 Thinking quickly, Trump broke the tension when he joked that he had only called O'Donnell these words, that many of his insults had been directed at her and her alone. The crowd "went wild," and an unfair attempt to "kill" his campaign\u160\'00\'A0had been defused.\par \par \uc2 Trump was upset with the way Kelly treated him during the debate, especially how Fox News Chairman and CEO\u160\'00\'A0Roger Ailes could have let that happen to one of his good friends. Subsequently, when Trump said Kelly had blood "coming out of her whatever," he meant her nose and eyes, which is a common saying\u160\'00\'A0that it's pretty amazing you haven't heard before.\par \par \uc2 Some of Trump's supporters issued death threats to Kelly,\u160\'00\'A0but they didn't mean them.\par \par \uc2 And\u160\'00\'A0the whole situation was kind of fun. Just like illegal immigration, we wouldn't be talking about Megyn Kelly\u160\'00\'A0if it weren't for \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 .\u160\'00\'A0And now her ratings are better than ever, thanks to \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 . Actually, what isn't better because of \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 ?\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 The end.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020150829eb8j002dk\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 MARYLAND GOV. Larry Hogan, whose record in his first seven months in office qualifies him as among the nation's least partisan Republican chief executives, is under unfair attack from immigration activists. They're unhappy that he is cooperating with the Obama administration's new \u8212\'20\'14 and far more lenient \u8212\'20\'14 policy on detaining and deporting undocumented immigrants. In fact, Mr.\u160\'00\'A0Hogan's stance, adopted without announcement after he took office in January, is the right and responsible thing to do.\par \par \uc2 The governor is the target of criticism mainly because immigration activists apparently oppose deportation in practically every instance, without regard to whether a deportee is a felon, terrorist, repeat offender, domestic abuser or sexual predator. How else to understand why they would seek to undercut the Obama administration's policy, announced last fall and in effect since July\u160\'00\'A01, known as the Priority Enforcement Program?\par \par \uc2 Under that program, the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2  requests cooperation from local law enforcement agencies preparing to release certain undocumented immigrants from jail. The department wants a heads-up before they are released so federal agents can detain them and process them for deportation \u8212\'20\'14 but only if they fit in certain well-defined categories.\par \par \uc2 Those categories include suspected terrorists and spies; gang members; convicted felons; domestic and sexual abusers; drug dealers and drunk drivers. Undocumented immigrants jailed for routine traffic and other minor offenses are explicitly excluded as priorities for detention or deportation. In all, according to a recent report by the \uc2 Migration Policy Institute\uc2 , about 13\u160\'00\'A0percent of the estimated 11\u160\'00\'A0million undocumented immigrants \u8212\'20\'14 mainly criminals and recent illegal border-crossers \u8212\'20\'14 would be targeted for deportation. The other 87\u160\'00\'A0percent of generally law-abiding immigrants are not a focus of the administration's deportation efforts.\par \par \uc2 That strikes a good balance. It's nonsense to suggest, as some immigration activists do, that local law enforcement agencies undercut their relations with immigrant communities by cooperating with federal officials. Like any other community, immigrants can and do distinguish between bad actors and good.\par \par \uc2 In complying with the administration's policy, Mr.\u160\'00\'A0Hogan is doing nothing more than instructing state prisons and the Baltimore city jail, which is under the state's aegis, to cooperate with federal officials by giving 48 hours' notice to Immigration and Customs Enforcement before undocumented immigrants are released from custody, so they they can be screened for criminal activity and detained by ICE if they fall into an offending category.\par \par \uc2 It was precisely that sort of cooperation that was lacking when San Francisco authorities released Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez this spring. Mr.\u160\'00\'A0Lopez-Sanchez, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who had served various prison terms for a criminal record in four states reaching back to 1991, and who had been deported five times previously, was allowed to walk out of jail unencumbered under the city's sanctuary policy which, applied blindly, gives dangerous criminals a free pass to re-enter society. A few months later, according to his own account, he fatally shot Kathryn Steinle, a 32-year-old woman who was strolling on a city pier with her father.\par \par \uc2 Unlike many elected Republicans, Mr.\u160\'00\'A0Hogan has not made an issue of illegal immigration; in fact, he's generally avoided the topic. In acceding to the Obama administration's request for cooperation, he's not joining the ranks of immigrant-bashers; he's simply applying common sense to an issue that involves public safety.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020150829eb8f00145\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved   \par \par \uc2 Dozens of people marched around the governor's mansion in Annapolis on Thursday, protesting Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan's decision to notify federal officials when an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  targeted for deportation is released from the state-run Baltimore City Detention Center.\par \par \uc2 They chanted in Spanish: "The people united will never be divided" and "We are in the fight."\par \par \uc2 They said they hoped to compel Hogan (R) to reconsider his decision, which was made shortly after he took office in January. Advocates worry that the action could lead to the deportations of people who have not committed serious crimes.\par \par \uc2 "We want Maryland to remain a welcoming state," said Gustavo Andrade, organizing director for CASA, an immigrant advocacy group with offices in Maryland. "Our community will not be scapegoated and our families will not be separated so extreme politicians can score cheap points."\par \par \uc2 A spokesman for Hogan said the advocates are misdirecting their criticism, noting that Hogan is complying with a request from the Obama administration.\par \par \uc2 "CASA wants to make this about Governor Hogan, and it's not," Matt Clark said. "It's White House policy."\par \par \uc2 [Hogan has decided the state will cooperate with feds on undocumented detainees]\par \par \uc2 The Obama administration asked local officials this summer to notify their federal counterparts 48 hours before an immigrant who is being targeted for deportation is scheduled to be released so that agents can move to detain them. The agency says only immigrants who have been convicted of a serious crime, are involved in a gang or are considered a threat to national security would be targeted.\par \par \uc2 The issue of how state and local governments deal with illegal immigrants came to the forefront after the slaying last month of Kathryn Steinle, 31, in San Francisco. The suspect in that case, Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, was released from custody in April by San Francisco authorities, despite the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2 's request that the seven-time felon be detained so that he could be deported to Mexico.\par \par \uc2 Advocates say Hogan's decision runs counter to the position taken by former governor Martin O'Malley (D), who refused to cooperate with some of the federal government's immigration enforcement efforts.\par \par \uc2 They sent a letter to Hogan on Thursday asking him not to comply with the federal request. Hogan has no obligation to cooperate, Andrade said, and many mayors in big cities across the country have opted not to because of questions that surrounded the federal government's previous effort, known as Secure Communities. Under that program, Homeland Security asked police to hold immigrants it wanted to deport for up to 48 hours after their scheduled release. The program received backlash from advocates and elected officials, who raised legal and civil liberties concerns.\par \par \uc2 "Until [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] can prove itself worthy of trust, we ask that you decline to send notification to it about release," said the letter signed by about 25 immigration advocates and civil rights organizations. "In light of the enormous federal failure to repair a broken immigration system, we ask that you remain focused on building the strongest local communities possible."\par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com\par \par \uc2 WP20150814mdprotest0814\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020150814eb8e0003u\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Dozens of people of all ages marched around the iron fence surrounding the governor's mansion in Annapolis on Thursday, protesting Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan's decision to notify federal immigration officials when an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  targeted for deportation is released from the state-run Baltimore City Detention Center.\par \par \uc2 They chanted in Spanish: "The people united will never be divided" and "We are in the fight."\par \par \uc2 They said they hoped to compel Hogan (R) to reconsider his decision, which was made with no fanfare shortly after he took office in January. Advocates worry that the action could lead to the deportations of people who have not committed serious crimes.\par \par \uc2 "We want Maryland to remain a welcoming state," said Gustavo Andrade, organizing director for Casa de Maryland, an immigrant advocacy group. "Our community will not be scapegoated, and our families will not be separated so extreme politicians can score cheap points."\par \par \uc2 A spokesman for Hogan said the advocates are misdirecting their criticism, noting that Hogan is simply complying with a request of the Obama administration.\par \par \uc2 "Casa wants to make this about Governor Hogan and it's not," Matt Clark said. "It's White House policy."\par \par \uc2 The Obama administration asked local officials this summer to notify their federal counterparts 48 hours before an immigrant who is being targeted for deportation is scheduled to be released so that agents can move to detain them. The agency says only immigrants who have been convicted of a serious crime, are involved in a gang or are considered a threat to national security would be targeted.\par \par \uc2 The issue of local governments cooperating with federal authorities in dealing with illegal immigrants has come to the forefront since the slaying last month of Kathryn Steinle, 31, in San Francisco. The suspect in that case, Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, had been released from custody in April by San Francisco authorities despite a request from Homeland Security for the seven-time felon to be detained so that he could be deported back to Mexico.\par \par \uc2 Advocates say Hogan's decision runs counter to the position taken by former governor Martin O'Malley (D), who refused to cooperate with some of the federal government's immigration enforcement efforts.\par \par \uc2 They sent a letter to Hogan on Thursday asking him not to comply with the federal request. Hogan has no obligation to cooperate, Andrade said, and many mayors in big cities across the country have opted not to because of questions that surrounded the federal government's previous effort, known as Secure Communities. Under that program, the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2  asked police to hold immigrants it wanted to deport for up to 48 hours after their scheduled release from custody. The program received backlash from advocates and elected officials, who raised legal and civil liberties concerns with \uc2 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "Until ICE can prove itself worthy of trust, we ask that you decline to send notification to it about release," said the letter signed by about 25 immigration advocates and civil rights organizations. "In light of the enormous federal failure to repair a broken immigration system, we ask that you remain focused on building the strongest local communities possible."\par \par \uc2 ovetta.wiggins@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020150829eb8d000gc\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Immigration advocates in Maryland are criticizing a decision by Gov. Larry Hogan to notify federal immigration officials when an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  targeted for deportation is released from the state-run Baltimore City Detention Center.\par \par \uc2 Advocates consider Hogan's stance to be a departure from the policy of his predecessor, Democrat Martin O'Malley, who last year joined other elected officials in refusing requests from the Obama administration to coordinate with federal law enforcement whenever a detainee was being released.\par \par \uc2 Hogan's decision, which was made with no fanfare shortly after he took office in January, is especially troubling, advocates say, because it is his first significant action regarding immigration policy.\par \par \uc2 CASA de Maryland, an immigrant advocacy group, has scheduled a protest in front of the governor's mansion Thursday afternoon.\par \par \uc2 The issue of local governments cooperating with federal authorities in dealing with illegal immigrants has come to the forefront since the slaying last month of Kathryn Steinle, 31, in San Francisco. The suspect in that case, Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, had been released from custody in April by San Francisco authorities despite a request from Homeland Security for the seven-time felon to be detained so that he could be deported back to Mexico.\par \par \uc2 During O'Malley's eight years as governor, activists applauded his efforts to secure in-state tuition for undocumented immigrants and allow them to obtain driver's licenses, with some restrictions. They also were buoyed by his position on detainees.\par \par \uc2 Although Hogan did not campaign on any immigration-related issues, advocates have been watching the Republican governor carefully to see whether he would take a different approach.\par \par \uc2 "This really is the first ball out of the park," said Kim Propeak, the director of CASA in Action, the political arm of the immigrant-advocacy organization. "And it doesn't bode well. It is very, very worrying."\par \par \uc2 Doug Mayer, a spokesman for Hogan, said the governor is simply complying with a request made by the Obama administration \u8212\'20\'14 and has made no effort to reverse the driver's license program or Maryland's so-called "Dream Act," the legislation that provides in-state tuition to undocumented immigrants.\par \par \uc2 "We are not making immigration an issue here," Mayer said. "This is not an immigration issue. It's a public safety issue."\par \par \uc2 Around the time that Hogan took office, the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2  changed the type of cooperation it was seeking from local officials on detainees.\par \par \uc2 During O'Malley's tenure, the agency's Secure Communities program asked localities to hold inmates for up to 48\u160\'00\'A0hours beyond their scheduled release from custody to allow \uc2 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2  to explore potential immigration violations and to take action if any were found.\par \par \uc2 The program was controversial. O'Malley directed the state-run Baltimore jail not to comply, joining several mayors in large cities across the country. More than 350 communities ended or scaled back their participation, citing legal and civil liberties concerns.\par \par \uc2 The administration did away with the Secure Communities program earlier this year, and said it would be replaced this summer by the Priority Enforcement Program.\par \par \uc2 That initiative asks local officials to notify their federal counterparts 48\u160\'00\'A0hours before an immigrant who is being targeted for deportation is scheduled to be released so that agents can move to detain them. The agency says only immigrants who have been convicted of a serious crime, is involved in a gang or is considered a threat to national security would be targeted.\par \par \uc2 But pro-immigrant groups have blasted the new program, despite the changes, and officials in the city of Los Angeles have said their police department still will not cooperate.\par \par \uc2 Mark Vernarelli, a spokesman for the \uc2 Maryland Department of Public Safety and Corrections\uc2 , said the state will adhere to the program and is notifying the federal government when an undocumented immigrant who fits the \uc2 DHS\uc2  criteria is close to being released.\par \par \uc2 "This will permit ICE to assume custody of the individual immediately upon release from a department facility," he said.\par \par \uc2 The state will also voluntarily hold detainees for up to 48 hours beyond their scheduled release date if \uc2 DHS\uc2  can produce a detainer, backed up by a judicial warrant, establishing probable cause for a serious charge, Vernarelli said.\par \par \uc2 Sirine Shebaya, the attorney who directs the \uc2 ACLU\uc2  of Maryland's immigrants' rights advocacy, called the decision by Hogan "counter-productive," arguing that it undermines public safety by further breaking down the trust between police and immigrant communities.\par \par \uc2 ovetta.wiggins@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020150829eb8d0004a\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved   \par \par \uc2 Immigration advocates in Maryland are criticizing a decision by Gov. Larry Hogan to notify federal immigration officials when an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  targeted for deportation is released from the state-run Baltimore City Detention Center.\par \par \uc2 Advocates consider Hogan's stance to be a departure from the policy of his predecessor, Democrat Martin O'Malley, who last year joined other elected officials in refusing requests from the Obama administration to coordinate with federal law enforcement whenever a detainee was being released.\par \par \uc2 [O'Malley directs state-run jail to cut back on immigrant detentions]\par \par \uc2 Hogan's decision, which was made with no fanfare shortly after he took office in January, is especially troubling, advocates say, because it is his first significant action regarding immigration policy.\par \par \uc2 CASA de Maryland, an immigrant advocacy group, has scheduled a protest in front of the governor's mansion Thursday afternoon.\par \par \uc2 During O'Malley's eight years as governor, activists applauded his efforts to secure in-state tuition for undocumented immigrants and allow them to obtain driver's licenses, with some restrictions. They also were buoyed by his position on detainees.\par \par \uc2 Although Hogan did not campaign on any immigration- related issues, advocates have been watching the Republican governor carefully to see whether he would take a different approach.\par \par \uc2 "This really is the first ball out of the park," said Kim Propeak, the director of CASA in Action, the political arm of the immigrant-advocacy organization. "And it doesn't bode well. It is very, very worrying."\par \par \uc2 Doug Mayer, a spokesman for Hogan, said the governor is simply complying with a request made by the Obama administration - and has made no effort to reverse the driver's license program or Maryland's so-called "Dream Act," the legislation that provides in-state tuition to undocumented immigrants.\par \par \uc2 "We are not making immigration an issue here," Mayer said. "This is not an immigration issue. It's a public safety issue."\par \par \uc2 [In policy shift, Obama administration scales back deportations]\par \par \uc2 Around the time that Hogan took office, the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2  changed the type of cooperation it was seeking from local officials on detainees.\par \par \uc2 During O'Malley's tenure, the agency's Secure Communities program asked localities to hold inmates for up to 48 hours beyond their scheduled release from custody to allow \uc2 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2  to explore potential immigration violations and to take action if any were found.\par \par \uc2 The program was controversial. O'Malley directed the state-run Baltimore jail not to comply, joining several mayors in large cities across the country. More than 350 communities ended or scaled back their participation, citing legal and civil liberties concerns.\par \par \uc2 The administration did away with the Secure Communities program earlier this year, and said it would be replaced this summer by the Priority Enforcement Program.\par \par \uc2 That initiative asks local officials to notify their federal counterparts 48 hours before an immigrant who is being targeted for deportation is scheduled to be released so that agents can move to detain them. The agency says only immigrants who have been convicted of a serious crime, is involved in a gang or is considered a threat to national security would be targeted.\par \par \uc2 But pro-immigrant groups have blasted the new program, despite the changes, and officials in the city of Los Angeles have said their police department still will not cooperate.\par \par \uc2 [New deportation program meets with resistance]\par \par \uc2 Mark Vernarelli, a spokesman for the \uc2 Maryland Department of Public Safety and Corrections\uc2 , said the state will adhere to the program and is notifying the federal government when an undocumented immigrant who fits the \uc2 DHS\uc2  criteria is close to being released.\par \par \uc2 "This will permit ICE to assume custody of the individual immediately upon release from a department facility," he said.\par \par \uc2 The state will also voluntarily hold detainees for up to 48 hours beyond their scheduled release date if \uc2 DHS\uc2  can produce a detainer, backed up by a judicial warrant, establishing probable cause for a serious charge, Vernarelli said.\par \par \uc2 Sirine Shebaya, the attorney who directs the \uc2 ACLU\uc2  of Maryland's immigrants' rights advocacy, called the decision by Hogan "counter-productive," arguing that it undermines public safety by further breaking down the trust between police and immigrant communities.\par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com\par \par \uc2 WP20150813hogandetainees0813\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020150813eb8d0003p\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The ongoing one-sided feud between \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  and Megyn Kelly over her totally appropriate question about the presidential candidate's temperament given his past disparaging remarks about women is as fascinating as it is horrifying. While we haven't heard anything from the Fox News host since Thursday's debate, Trump has been all over the place simultaneously making things worse for political discourse and better for himself.\par \par \uc2 The Donald has said some of the most outrageous things a politician could say. He denigrated \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  Mexicans as "rapists." He smeared a former prisoner of war who is now a U.S. senator and was the \uc2 Republican Party\uc2 's 2008 presidential nominee. In Cleveland last week, Trump used a question about his disparaging comments about women to insult another woman by name. And in the raging controversy over his remark, he has stoked it further by going after Kelly for having the temerity to ask him a legitimate question.\par \par \uc2 In isolation, each comment should be disqualifying. They should have no place in our political discourse and are certainly not presidential. We do and should demand more from anyone seeking to be leader of the free world and be in our faces for up to eight years. Look, I get it. For many, so-called political correctness is constriction of speech. But there's not wanting to bow to "political correctness" and then there is willful pandering to the hate-filled anger that once roiled below the surface but now churns openly on the far right.\par \par \uc2 [How selective outrage over Trump is dooming the GOP]\par \par \uc2 And it is paying off for The Donald. With every putrid utterance, Trump has gone up in the polls. Like most everyone else in the Acela corridor, I'm mystified by Trump's willingness to contribute to and politically profit from the steep decline in civility. As a guest host of \uc2 MSNBC\uc2 's "UP with Steve Kornacki" on Saturday, I called in the ultimate Trump Whisperer to help make sense of all this.\par \par \uc2 Omarosa Manigault, who appeared in 75 episodes over three seasons of Trump's hit reality television show "The Apprentice," believes Trump was "spectacular" in the debate. The die-hard Democrat who jokingly said she has "Hillary Clinton tattooed on my left arm," also said that "there's a different analysis and metrics you have to use" when analyzing the Big Apple billionaire's appeal.\par \par \uc2 "Reality television has now taken over television. People want to see real moments and see life unfold in front of them. Not scripted, but real moments," Omarosa said. When I pushed back and asked whether the reality TV ethos should be bleeding into presidential politics, she set me straight.\par \par \uc2 "[W]hen you have a big reality TV star as the front-runner for the Republican nomination there is no way to separate it. This is the new reality. \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  is the front-runner and you have to deal with everything that comes with it," Omarosa said. "He's going to have to give his position on serious issues and he may also call people pigs but that's part of the Trump thing that comes with the package."\par \par \uc2 [The beginning of the end of Trump]\par \par \uc2 Calling Trump the "Tiger Woods of politics" because the record-breaking debate has engaged people otherwise not interested in politics or the \uc2 Republican Party\uc2 , Omarosa asked, "Can we stop trying to write the \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  obituary? He's not going anywhere. He has staying power."\par \par \uc2 I wish I could argue otherwise, but I can't.\par \par \uc2 Joseph McQuaid, the publisher of New Hampshire's Union Leader newspaper, put it best in the \uc2 New York Times\uc2  over the weekend. "Trump's base is more the people who used to have season tickets to the Roman Colosseum," he said. "Not sure that they vote in great numbers, but they like blood sport."\par \par \uc2 The 2012 Republican presidential field was derided as a clown car, what with improbable candidates such as Michele Bachmann and Herman Cain able to claim having been front-runners for the nomination. Without question, the 2016 field is stronger, with a former Fortune 20 chief executive, four sitting governors, five former governors, four sitting senators, one former senator and a neurosurgeon. But the packed car this year is being driven by a clown.\par \par \uc2 As long as the other candidates and the party allow reality television rules apply to the 2016 campaign, Trump will come out on top.\par \par \uc2 Follow Jonathan on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 : @Capehartj\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020150811eb8b000un\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

Here's the latest from our reporters on the ground: "At a press conference at 3:30 a.m.,\u160\'00\'A0Chief Jon Belmar of the \uc2 St. Louis County Police\uc2  said plainclothes officers were monitoring a man in a crowd of protesters who they believed was armed. Belmar did not offer many specifics, but said the man, armed with a stolen 9mm Sig Sauer, was involved in an exchange of gunfire with another party, then fired on four plainclothes officers in an unmarked SUV. The officers fired back, hitting the man, who is now in critical, 'unstable' condition, and is in surgery. The officers were not injured."\u160\'00\'A0The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports that Tyrone Harris Sr. identified the victim as his son, Tyrone Harris Jr., 18, of St. Louis.\u160\'00\'A0Harris said his son had gotten out of surgery, and was a friend of Brown's.\par \par \uc2 THE BIG IDEA:\par \par \uc2 After President Obama won in 2012, Republican National Committee Chairman \uc2 Reince Priebus\uc2  ordered a post-election autopsy to look at what went wrong. \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2  lost women by 11 points, and the \uc2 RNC\uc2  zeroed in on an even more troubling figure: Among the 40 percent of female voters who were single, Obama won by a "whopping" 36 percent.\par \par \uc2 This was one of the 10 recommendations for closing the gap: "According to the liberal group \uc2 Center for American Progress\uc2  , the No. 2 issue for female voters this election was 'a candidate who will fight for them.' Our candidates, spokespeople and staff need to use language that addresses concerns that are on women's minds in order to let them know we are fighting for them."\par \par \uc2 Fast forward two-and-a-half years. \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  , angry about the tough line of questioning he faced from Megyn Kelly during the GOP debate, said Friday that the Fox News host "had blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever"\u8212\'20\'14an apparent reference to menstruation. Kelly pressing him on his long history of flippant misogyny only added insult to injury.\par \par \uc2 This prompted RedState's Erick Erickson to disinvite the billionaire from a Saturday cattle call for conservative activists. Scott Walker and Jeb Bush quickly called out\u160\'00\'A0Trump. "I think women of all kinds are really sort of horrified by this," Carly Fiorina said Sunday.\par \par \uc2 Lindsey Graham\uc2  warned that Trump is inflicting permanent and possibly fatal damage to the Republican brand. He chided his rivals for giving Trump "a pass" on stage. "I think we've crossed that Rubicon, where his behavior becomes about us, not just him," the South Carolina senator\u160\'00\'A0told The Post's Philip Rucker . "I hope the party leadership will push hard \u8230\'20\'26 There can be no more tiptoeing around this."\par \par \uc2 But tiptoe some are.\par \par \uc2 "I've made a decision here with \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  \u8212\'20\'14 you know, if I comment on everything he says, I mean, my whole campaign will be consumed by it. That's all I'll do all day," \uc2 Marco Rubio\uc2  said on "Meet the Press," even though he had no qualms criticizing Trump when he went after \uc2 John McCain\uc2  . "We'll let him answer for what he says and so forth."\par \par \uc2 Priebus was scheduled to appear yesterday on "Face the Nation," but he canceled late Saturday. An \uc2 RNC\uc2  official told the 202 last night that he pulled out because \uc2 CBS\uc2  shortened his hit and wanted to put him on at the end of the show. But while insisting that the cancellation had nothing to do with a leeriness of talking Trump, the \uc2 RNC\uc2  said Priebus was traveling all weekend and not available to weigh in on Trump, even with a paper statement.\par \par \uc2 Appearing on the "Today" show Saturday morning, \uc2 RNC\uc2  chief strategist \uc2 Sean Spicer\uc2  was measured and refused to renounce Trump's comments. "He's got to be clearly more careful with his words," Spicer said. "There's no question he needs to immediately clarify that comment \u8230\'20\'26 I'm hoping that Mr. Trump, because he does speak off the cuff, because he doesn't ascribe to political correctness, was speaking in a way that wasn't fully thought out." Ducking a question about whether the Trump imbroglio is damaging to the party, Spicer added that Trump "needs to be much more understanding of the fact that every word that you say is being scrutinized at this point."\par \par \uc2 This is all playing out amidst a race to the right among the 2016 candidates on issues that matter to women.\par \par \uc2 On "Meet," Rubio clarified that he opposes abortion in all cases, including after rape and incest and to protect the life of the mother \u8212\'20\'14 a stance that could prove immensely damaging during a general election. "I'll support any legislation that reduces the number of abortions," he said. Even Romney accepted abortion in the cases of rape, incest, and to save the life of the mother. Rubio argued that "protecting the life of the mother is the one that I think holds the highest validity," but then claimed that's "there's a debate \u8230\'20\'26 given modern medicine, whether there is any condition that only abortion could save a mother's life in a viable pregnancy." Walker has also staked out this space.\par \par \uc2 In 2014, Republicans worked fiercely to stop their candidates from talking about abortion and other issues that might alienate women voters. But led by Trump, all of that work is threatening to unravel in a potentially profound\u160\'00\'A0way for the party.\par \par \uc2 Here's the latest on the fast-moving Trump story\u8212\'20\'14\par \par \uc2 Breitbart staffers believe that Trump has given money to the site in exchange for favorable coverage,\u160\'00\'A0\uc2 BuzzFeed\uc2  's McKay Coppins reports: "According to four sources with knowledge of the situation, editors and writers at the [conservative news] outlet have privately complained since at least last year that the company's top management was allowing Trump to turn Breitbart into his own fan website \u8212\'20\'14 using it to hype his political prospects, and attack his enemies. One current editor called the water-carrying 'despicable' and 'embarrassing,' and said he was told by an executive last year that the company had a financial arrangement with Trump. A second Breitbart staffer said he had heard a similar description of the site's relationship with the billionaire but didn't know the details; and a third source at the company said he knew of several instances when managers had overruled editors at Trump's behest. \u8230\'20\'26 Breitbart executive chairman Steve Bannon responded to questions with a statement denying that the company has ever had a 'financial relationship' with the candidate."\par \par \uc2 Trump again dominated the Sunday shows, calling into four of them. In multiple instances, he declined to apologize to Kelly, arguing that he never meant to suggest that she had her menstrual period when she asked him pointed questions at the debate. "I was going to say nose and/or ears because that's a very common statement," he said. "Only a deviant would say that what I said was what they were referring to. You almost have to be sick to put that together."\par \par \uc2 Unbowed, Trump went after Fiorina last night: "I just realized that if you listen to Carly Fiorina for more than ten minutes straight, you develop a massive headache," he posted on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  . This back-and-forth, combined with her victory\u160\'00\'A0in the happy hour debate Thursday, seems virtually certain to get Fiorina a slot on\u160\'00\'A0the main stage for the next debate, at Ronald Reagan's presidential library on Sept. 16.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, a full-fledged debate is now unfolding on the right over who enabled Trump.\par \par \uc2 * An editorial in today's\u160\'00\'A0Wall Street Journal rips Erickson, who disinvited Trump from his weekend summit, for trumpeting him two weeks ago: "Mr. Erickson represents a strain on the right that has put Trumpian bluster above political reality and conservative ideas. It's the fashion in these circles to celebrate Mr. Trump's rise in the polls as if rage and insult will defeat \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  and implement conservative reforms. \u8230\'20\'26 Having helped to create Trumpism, Mr. Erickson and his angry enablers now claim to be embarrassed by its namesake. It would have been better had they not indulged him in the first place."\par \par \uc2 * Erickson himself puts the blame squarely on Trump's shoulders in a blog post that just went live: "The story is not moving on. The longer Trump is talking about Megyn Kelly, me, blood, or himself, he is not talking about Mexico, immigration, foreign policy, the national debt, the other candidates, etc. The very issues that brought Trump to prominence, as they fade from his voice, give other candidates opportunity to pick them up in their own voice and run with them while Trump is bogged down in the August doldrums. Trump's high polling will linger on awhile, but if another story does not come along to push stories about Trump personally off the front pages and lead stories of the television news, he will just be another in the long list of political stories that flare up and fade in the August doldrums of American politics."\par \par \uc2 Behind the scenes of Trump's campaign shakeup: Roger Stone, a political confidant to Trump since the 1980s, has departed under uncertain terms. "Trump said he 'fired' Stone because he was seeking too much publicity; Stone said in a resignation letter to Trump that he was quitting out of frustration with what he saw as Trump's scant platform and the 'current direction of the candidacy,'" Robert Costa and Philip Rucker report on the front page of today's Post.\par \par \uc2 WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14\u160\'00\'A0Details of \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 's new higher education plan (which would cost $350 billion over 10 years) began to pop online: "Clinton's plan, which she is set to unveil Monday in New Hampshire, would also make community colleges free and ensure that those with student loans wouldn't be required to pay more than 10 percent of their income in debt payments," the \uc2 Boston Globe\uc2  's Annie Linskey reports. "The plan would be paid for by limiting the value of itemized tax deductions for the wealthiest taxpayers, and increasing unspecified taxes \u8230\'20\'26 According to the Clinton plan, the government should 'never profit' from paying for living costs at college \u8212\'20\'14 under the current system, the federal government does make money off of student debt. 'This one change, if enacted today, would cut interest rates nearly in half,' it states."\par \par \uc2 "The other two serious contenders for the Democratic nomination put forward detailed student debt plans months ago," Linskey writes. "Clinton's plan borrows some ideas from Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. It would allow those who currently carry debt to refinance loans at current rates. Clinton's campaign estimates that allowing refinancing would save 25 million borrowers roughly $2,000 a year over the life of their loans \u8230\'20\'26 It also aims to penalize predatory lenders and institutions that repeatedly charge borrowers too much. \uc2 The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\uc2  would be given new unspecified powers to prevent students from being misled. Lenders that repeatedly overcharge borrowers would be banned from servicing federal loans."\par \par \uc2 GET SMART FAST:\par \par \uc2 * The Office of Personnel Management's inspector general has accused the agency's information technology office of trying to thwart scrutiny of how well OPM protected the security clearance and federal employee personnel files that were hacked and how well it responded to those breaches.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The ongoing one-sided feud between \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  and Megyn Kelly over her totally appropriate question about the presidential candidate's temperament given his past disparaging remarks about women is as fascinating as it is horrifying. While we haven't heard anything from the Fox News host since Thursday's debate, Trump has been all over the place simultaneously making things worse for political discourse and better for himself.\par \par \uc2 The Donald has said some of the most outrageous things a politician could say. He denigrated \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  Mexicans as "rapists." He smeared a former prisoner of war who is now a U.S. senator and was the \uc2 Republican Party\uc2 's 2008 presidential nominee. In Cleveland last week, Trump used a question about his disparaging comments about women to insult another woman by name. And in the raging controversy over his remark, he has stoked it further by going after Kelly for having the temerity to ask him a legitimate question.\par \par \uc2 In isolation, each comment should be disqualifying. They should have no place in our political discourse and are certainly not presidential. We do and should demand more from anyone seeking to be leader of the free world and be in our faces for up to eight years. Look, I get it. For many, so-called political correctness is constriction of speech. But there's not wanting to bow to "political correctness" and then there is willful pandering to the hate-filled anger that once roiled below the surface but now churns openly on the far right.\par \par \uc2 [How selective outrage over Trump is dooming the GOP]\par \par \uc2 And it is paying off for The Donald. With every putrid utterance, Trump has gone up in the polls. Like most everyone else in the Acela corridor, I'm mystified by Trump's willingness to contribute to and politically profit from the steep decline in civility. As a guest host of \uc2 MSNBC\uc2 's "UP with Steve Kornacki" on Saturday, I called in the ultimate Trump Whisperer to help make sense of all this.\par \par \uc2 Omarosa Manigault, who appeared in 75 episodes over three seasons of Trump's hit reality television show "The Apprentice," believes Trump was "spectacular" in the debate. The die-hard Democrat who jokingly said she has "Hillary Clinton tattooed on my left arm," also said that "there's a different analysis and metrics you have to use" when analyzing the Big Apple billionaire's appeal.\par \par \uc2 "Reality television has now taken over television. People want to see real moments and see life unfold in front of them. Not scripted, but real moments," Omarosa said. When I pushed back and asked whether the reality TV ethos should be bleeding into presidential politics, she set me straight.\par \par \uc2 "[W]hen you have a big reality TV star as the front-runner for the Republican nomination there is no way to separate it. This is the new reality. \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  is the front-runner and you have to deal with everything that comes with it," Omarosa said. "He's going to have to give his position on serious issues and he may also call people pigs but that's part of the Trump thing that comes with the package."\par \par \uc2 [The beginning of the end of Trump]\par \par \uc2 Calling Trump the "Tiger Woods of politics" because the record-breaking debate has engaged people otherwise not interested in politics or the \uc2 Republican Party\uc2 , Omarosa asked, "Can we stop trying to write the \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  obituary? He's not going anywhere. He has staying power."\par \par \uc2 I wish I could argue otherwise, but I can't.\par \par \uc2 Joseph McQuaid, the publisher of New Hampshire's Union Leader newspaper, put it best in the \uc2 New York Times\uc2  over the weekend. "Trump's base is more the people who used to have season tickets to the Roman Colosseum," he said. "Not sure that they vote in great numbers, but they like blood sport."\par \par \uc2 The 2012 Republican presidential field was derided as a clown car, what with improbable candidates such as Michele Bachmann and Herman Cain able to claim having been front-runners for the nomination. Without question, the 2016 field is stronger, with a former Fortune 20 chief executive, four sitting governors, five former governors, four sitting senators, one former senator and a neurosurgeon. But the packed car this year is being driven by a clown.\par \par \uc2 As long as the other candidates and the party allow reality television rules apply to the 2016 campaign, Trump will come out on top.\par \par \uc2 Follow Jonathan on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 : @Capehartj\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020150810eb8a004pi\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 There is a segment of the American public \u8212\'20\'14 goodness knows if they are Republicans, ideological conservatives or even registered voters \u8212\'20\'14 that revels in raucous rhetoric, anti-government conspiracies and just plain nastiness in the name of anti-establishment politics. For a time they organized themselves into what became known as the tea party movement. They formed the audience for the most vicious and xenophobic talk radio hosts. They built micro-blogs and proclaimed themselves leaders of the "conservative movement." They gave birth to groups such as Heritage Action, whose mission (aside from raising gobs of money) is to promote the idea that compromise and good governance are antithetical to conservatism. They aimed their fire on insufficiently pure conservatives and declared congressional leadership to be a threat to the party. They are populists on steroids for whom "conservatism" amounts to a reactionary strain of political entertainment.\par \par \uc2  Their ideas \u8212\'20\'14 which include protectionism, opposition to free trade, defiance of the courts, isolationism and a return to pre-New Deal America \u8212\'20\'14 bear little resemblance to the modern conservative movement of Russell Kirk and Ronald Reagan. It is dark, pessimistic, angry and radical.\par \par \uc2 It's this faction that brought us to the era of \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 , the utter debasement of politics and the celebration of impulsive, aggressive sentiments in place of reasoned political debate. It's not much of a leap from Rush Limbaugh calling Sandra Fluke a "slut" to Trump's misogynistic tirades. While the subject matter may be different, the sophomoric escapade to shut down the government or calls to defy the Supreme Court's rulings are just one step away from Trump's stupid scheme to charge Mexico for each \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . It's all of a piece \u8212\'20\'14 high-testosterone rhetoric percolating in a toxic brew of xenophobia and willful ignorance. It's not surprising that the predecessors of Trumpism in the GOP presidential race \u8212\'20\'14 e.g., Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) \u8212\'20\'14 are not only afraid to take him on but also have been eclipsed by him.\par \par \uc2 The MSM would like us to believe that Trumpism is the essence of the GOP and of conservatism more generally. But the phalanx of thoughtful and accomplished 2016 presidential contestants, people who have actually accomplished conservative goals, refutes that. The class of freshman Senate grown-ups including Ben Sasse (Neb.), Dan Sullivan (Alaska) and Cory Gardner (Colo.) and the across-the-board defeat of wacky right-wing primary competitors in 2014 tells us that admirers of Trump are not the majority of the GOP.\par \par \uc2 Trump now threatens to gobble up Trumpism's antecedents. The beast has turned on\u160\'00\'A0them.\u160\'00\'A0RedState founder Erick Erickson, who for years peddled in nasty rhetoric and defamed the "establishment,"\u160\'00\'A0discovers, "Listen, if having common decency to other people makes you part of the establishment, I guess I am. I mean, if you can't be nice to someone who asks you a tough question, then okay, I guess I am. If being a member of the establishment is recognizing that there are bounds you shouldn't cross, and if you do you should apologize, then I guess I am." Well, isn't that rich? Erickson would like to blame the \uc2 Republican Party\uc2  for Trump, but the responsibility lies with him and others who promoted this style of politics and discourse for years.\par \par \uc2 Serious conservatives who dabbled in Trumpism now see its full flowering. Less serious conservative racketeers (e.g., the groups who cheered the shutdown) see the limitations of its appeal and its embarrassing attributes. And GOP primary voters may have been roused from their slumber, aware there is, as former Texas governor Rick Perry put it, a \u160\'00\'A0"cancer" growing on conservatism.\par \par \uc2 The presidential debates in this regard are a godsend. Trump and Trumpism are on full display. If one believes sunlight is an antiseptic to scurrilous characters, then Trump and his brand of politics will burn up and shrivel. There are at least a handful of accomplished, serious and conservative candidates who are capable of winning the nomination, leading the party and steering the right away from Trumpism. We will see who, in the weeks and months ahead, rises to the occasion.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020150810eb8a004k1\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National-Politics\par {\*\bkmkstart toc49}{\*\bkmkend toc49}\b \uc2 DHS\uc2  meets resistance to new deportation program\b0\par\par\uc2 By Jerry Markon   \par \uc2 1,546 \uc2 words\par \uc2 4 August 2015\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2015, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Philadelphia Mayor Michael A. Nutter scaled back cooperation with the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2 's immigration-enforcement efforts in April 2014, accusing agents of aggressively targeting for deportation illegal immigrants who led otherwise law-abiding lives.\par \par \uc2 Then he got a visit from Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson. And a follow-up phone call. And more calls from \uc2 DHS\uc2  officials. Their pitch: Support a new \uc2 DHS\uc2  program that aims to work with cities to deport immigrants who commit serious crimes and pose a national security threat \u8212\'20\'14 but take action against virtually no one else.\par \par \uc2 Nutter, who won plaudits from immigrant rights groups for his stand against the federal government, hasn't agreed. He praised Johnson in a recent interview but said the city is "articulating areas of concern we have with regard to the new program.''\par \par \uc2 His hesitance speaks to the promise \u8212\'20\'14 and the perils \u8212\'20\'14 of an intensive outreach effort being undertaken by Johnson, who runs the third-largest Cabinet department. The man charged with keeping the homeland safe is trying to repair \uc2 DHS\uc2 's frayed relationship with cities and police departments, at a time of divisive national debate over the nation's 11.3 million illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 The problems stem from a revolt against \uc2 DHS\uc2 's enforcement of immigration laws. Johnson in November scrapped Secure Communities, a program under which \uc2 DHS\uc2  asked police to hold immigrants it wanted to deport for up to 48 hours after their scheduled release from custody. More than 350 communities had ended or dialed back their participation, citing legal and civil liberties concerns.\par \par \uc2 Now, \uc2 DHS\uc2  is encountering similar challenges as it rolls out the replacement for Secure Communities: the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP), which began July 2. Pro-immigrant groups are already blasting the program, under which \uc2 DHS\uc2  will still coordinate with police to deport illegal immigrants but will mostly seek to be notified before they are released from custody, rather than having immigrants held beyond their scheduled release.\par \par \uc2 "Secure Communities needed to be fixed because it was inhibiting our ability to get at the criminals,'' Johnson recently told the House Judiciary Committee, adding that he thinks PEP "resolves the legal and political controversy.''\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18Walking a fine line\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 While \uc2 DHS\uc2  says more than 30 of the nation's largest law enforcement agencies have indicated a willingness to work with the agency on PEP, few have publicly said they will participate. The city of Los Angeles told The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2  that its police department, the nation's third largest, will not, though Los Angeles County is participating. Other jurisdictions \u8212\'20\'14 such as Philadelphia, with the fourth-largest police force \u8212\'20\'14 are wrestling with the issue at a time of changing demographics.\par \par \uc2 "We are walking a fine line,'' said John H. Eaves, chairman of the Board of Commissioners in Fulton County, Ga., where Atlanta is located. The county is discussing PEP with \uc2 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2  (ICE), the \uc2 DHS\uc2  agency enforcing the program.\par \par \uc2 "We want to make sure our community is safe,'' Eaves said. "At the same time, we are a diverse community with a strong immigrant population, and we want to make sure that everyone is afforded civil and human rights, and that no one is unduly held beyond a certain period of time.''\par \par \uc2 The debate reflects growing tension over immigration, which has become a major issue in the 2016 presidential campaign, in part because of Republican candidate \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 's disparaging remarks about illegal immigrants. The debate was inflamed by the July 1 killing of Kathryn Steinle along the San Francisco waterfront, allegedly by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  with a long criminal record.\par \par \uc2 The House recently voted to strip some federal funds from cities that do not cooperate fully with federal immigration authorities. They are known as sanctuary cities, but there is no reliable number of such cities or consensus on what constitutes a sanctuary city. The debate over PEP, experts said, is more reflective of the tensions between \uc2 DHS\uc2  and police over undocumented immigrants taken into custody.\par \par \uc2 DHS\uc2  officials expressed confidence that localities will embrace PEP, saying the program is needed to deport dangerous criminals and that it resolves the constitutional and other questions surrounding Secure Communities. But they acknowledged that their outreach effort has been difficult.\par \par \uc2 "A large part of the skepticism comes from just a poor track record with Secure Communities,'' said one \uc2 DHS\uc2  official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private meetings with local officials about PEP. "There's a trust deficit here that has to be overcome.''\par \par \uc2 Some immigrant advocates said Johnson \u8212\'20\'14 who along with DHS Deputy Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas has met with or spoken to hundreds of local officials about PEP \u8212\'20\'14 deserves credit for admitting that Secure Communities wasn't working and for starting over.\par \par \uc2 "When has an administration just turned its back on and scrapped an entire program that it spent five years expanding and rolling out nationwide?'' said \uc2 Marshall Fitz\uc2 , managing director for immigration at Emerson Collective, which advocates immigration reform. "Secretary Johnson really did take to heart a lot of the concerns that were raised.''\par \par \uc2 But \uc2 Angie Junck\uc2 , supervising attorney at the San Francisco-based \uc2 Immigrant Legal Resource Center\uc2 , criticized PEP as "the reincarnation of the failed and dangerous Secure Communities program.''\par \par \uc2 "We see this as \uc2 DHS\uc2  kind of rebranding to rebuild the trust they lost with a lot of local law enforcement agencies,'' she said. "We are very concerned that it will repeat the mistakes of the past.''\par \par \uc2 Legal trouble\par \par \uc2 Secure Communities began during the George W. Bush administration and was expanded under President Obama. It allowed ICE to lodge official requests with police departments that had arrested someone ICE wanted to deport. The requests called on police to hold the immigrants for up to 48 hours after their scheduled release so ICE could pick them up.\par \par \uc2 Although the program had been billed as a crackdown on immigrants who had committed serious crimes, it scooped up some long-term illegal immigrants with families and community ties who were arrested for minor offenses and then deported.\par \par \uc2 As outcry grew, Secure Communities ran into legal trouble. A series of federal court decisions raised legal and constitutional questions about the ICE hold requests, known as detainers, including a ruling last year in Oregon that said police could be liable for holding immigrants beyond their scheduled release date.\par \par \uc2 With police and sheriffs departments backing away, Johnson in November replaced Secure Communities with PEP. It limited the use of detainers and shifted the emphasis to notification requests, under which ICE will ask to be notified 48 hours before an immigrant is released from custody. In another key change, ICE will file the requests in cases where the immigrant has been convicted of a crime; before, the requests included those only charged.\par \par \uc2 The new program is part of a broader shift in \uc2 DHS\uc2 's priorities in which the department has been narrowing enforcement efforts to three groups of illegal migrants: convicted criminals, terrorism threats or those who recently crossed the southwest border.\par \par \uc2 But pro-immigrant groups are questioning PEP, saying it will further undermine police efforts to gain trust from immigrant communities. Others are raising new legal concerns, especially about the continuing use of detainers. Partly in response to the court decisions, ICE added boxes to its detainer form, in which agents will indicate their "probable cause" for why the immigrant in police custody can be deported.\par \par \uc2 "Probable cause is not a series of checked boxes,'' said Kate Desormeau, a staff attorney for the ACLU Immigrants' Rights Project, who said ICE should get approval from a judge before taking custody of an immigrant. She said the \uc2 ACLU\uc2  is considering whether to bring legal action over PEP.\par \par \uc2 Johnson has been selling the new program for months and won support from Montgomery County, Md., Police Chief J. Thomas Manger, president of an association of major-city chiefs. "\uc2 DHS\uc2  and ICE heard the concerns and complaints from police around the country,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 The District, which scaled back its cooperation with ICE several years ago, has not said publicly whether it will participate in PEP.\par \par \uc2 Other large-city police chiefs and officials praised Johnson's outreach, including Nutter, the Philadelphia mayor. "I trust Secretary Johnson. He has been tremendously sensitive and focused on these issues,'' Nutter said, before adding that he has reached no decision about whether to participate in PEP.\par \par \uc2 In Cook County, Ill., which has also limited its cooperation with ICE, Board of Commissioners President Toni Preckwinkle said in a statement that she "greatly appreciates Secretary Johnson traveling to Chicago'' to meet with her about PEP.\par \par \uc2 But she has also not committed, saying the county "is open to continued dialogue and further meetings.''\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, officials in New York City, which has the nation's largest police department, said only that they are still in talks with \uc2 DHS\uc2 . But the city's policy severely limits its cooperation with ICE detainers, saying they must be accompanied by a federal warrant.\par \par \uc2 "Families will no longer be needlessly torn apart by ICE's dragnet enforcement efforts," New \uc2 York City Council\uc2  Speaker \uc2 Melissa Mark-Viverito\uc2  said before the policy was approved in October.\par \par \uc2 It took effect six days before \uc2 DHS\uc2  announced the PEP program.\par \par \uc2 jerry.markon@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020150804eb84000gq\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved   \par \par \uc2 Philadelphia Mayor Michael A. Nutter scaled back cooperation with the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2 's immigration-enforcement efforts in April 2014, accusing agents of aggressively targeting for deportation illegal immigrants who led otherwise law-abiding lives.\par \par \uc2 Then he got a visit from Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson. And a follow-up phone call. And more calls from \uc2 DHS\uc2  officials. Their pitch: Support a new \uc2 DHS\uc2  program that aims to work with cities to deport immigrants who commit serious crimes and pose a national security threat - but take action against virtually no one else.\par \par \uc2 Nutter, who won plaudits from immigrant rights groups for his stand against the federal government, hasn't agreed. He praised Johnson in a recent interview but said the city is "articulating areas of concern we have with regard to the new program.''\par \par \uc2 His hesitance speaks to the promise - and the perils - of an intensive outreach effort being undertaken by Johnson, who runs the third-largest Cabinet department. The man charged with keeping the homeland safe is trying to repair \uc2 DHS\uc2 's frayed relationship with cities and police departments, at a time of divisive national debate over the nation's 11.3 million illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 The problems stem from a revolt against \uc2 DHS\uc2 's enforcement of immigration laws. Johnson in November scrapped Secure Communities, a program under which \uc2 DHS\uc2  asked police to hold immigrants it wanted to deport for up to 48 hours after their scheduled release from custody. More than 350 communities had ended or dialed back their participation, citing legal and civil liberties concerns.\par \par \uc2 Now, \uc2 DHS\uc2  is encountering similar challenges as it rolls out the replacement for Secure Communities: the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP), which began July 2. Pro-immigrant groups are already blasting the program, under which \uc2 DHS\uc2  will still coordinate with police to deport illegal immigrants but will mostly seek to be notified before they are released from custody, rather than having immigrants held beyond their scheduled release.\par \par \uc2 "Secure Communities needed to be fixed because it was inhibiting our ability to get at the criminals,'' Johnson recently told the House Judiciary Committee, adding that he thinks PEP "resolves the legal and political controversy.''\par \par \uc2 While \uc2 DHS\uc2  says more than 30 of the nation's largest law enforcement agencies have indicated a willingness to work with the agency on PEP, few have publicly said they will participate. The city of Los Angeles told The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2  that its police department, the nation's third largest, will not. Other jurisdictions - such as Philadelphia, with the fourth-largest police force - are wrestling with the issue at a time of changing demographics.\par \par \uc2 "We are walking a fine line,'' said John H. Eaves, chairman of the Board of Commissioners in Fulton County, Ga., where Atlanta is located. The county is discussing PEP with \uc2 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2  (ICE), the \uc2 DHS\uc2  agency enforcing the program.\par \par \uc2 "We want to make sure our community is safe,'' Eaves said. "At the same time, we are a diverse community with a strong immigrant population, and we want to make sure that everyone is afforded civil and human rights, and that no one is unduly held beyond a certain period of time.''\par \par \uc2 The debate reflects growing tension over immigration, which has become a major issue in the 2016 presidential campaign, in part because of Republican candidate \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 's disparaging remarks about illegal immigrants. The debate was inflamed by the July 1 killing of Kathryn Steinle along the San Francisco waterfront, allegedly by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  with a long criminal record.\par \par \uc2 The House recently voted to strip some federal funds from cities that do not cooperate fully with federal immigration authorities. They are known as sanctuary cities, but there is no reliable number of such cities or consensus on what constitutes a sanctuary city. The debate over PEP, experts said, is more reflective of the tensions between \uc2 DHS\uc2  and police over undocumented immigrants taken into custody.\par \par \uc2 DHS\uc2  officials expressed confidence that localities will embrace PEP, saying the program is needed to deport dangerous criminals and that it resolves the constitutional and other questions surrounding Secure Communities. But they acknowledged that their outreach effort has been difficult.\par \par \uc2 "A large part of the skepticism comes from just a poor track record with Secure Communities,'' said one \uc2 DHS\uc2  official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private meetings with local officials about PEP. "There's a trust deficit here that has to be overcome.''\par \par \uc2 Some immigrant advocates said Johnson - who along with DHS Deputy Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas has met with or spoken to hundreds of local officials about PEP - deserves credit for admitting that Secure Communities wasn't working and for starting over.\par \par \uc2 "When has an administration just turned its back on and scrapped an entire program that it spent five years expanding and rolling out nationwide?'' said \uc2 Marshall Fitz\uc2 , managing director for immigration at Emerson Collective, which advocates immigration reform. "Secretary Johnson really did take to heart a lot of the concerns that were raised.''\par \par \uc2 But \uc2 Angie Junck\uc2 , supervising attorney at the San Francisco-based \uc2 Immigrant Legal Resource Center\uc2 , criticized PEP as "the reincarnation of the failed and dangerous Secure Communities program.''\par \par \uc2 "We see this as \uc2 DHS\uc2  kind of rebranding to rebuild the trust they lost with a lot of local law enforcement agencies,'' she said. "We are very concerned that it will repeat the mistakes of the past.''\par \par \uc2 Secure Communities began during the George W. Bush administration and was expanded under President Obama. It allowed ICE to lodge official requests with police departments that had arrested someone ICE wanted to deport. The requests called on police to hold the immigrants for up to 48 hours after their scheduled release so ICE could pick them up.\par \par \uc2 Although the program had been billed as a crackdown on immigrants who had committed serious crimes, it scooped up some long-term illegal immigrants with families and community ties who were arrested for minor offenses and then deported.\par \par \uc2 As outcry grew, Secure Communities ran into legal trouble. A series of federal court decisions raised legal and constitutional questions about the ICE hold requests, known as detainers, including a ruling last year in Oregon that said police could be liable for holding immigrants beyond their scheduled release date.\par \par \uc2 With police and sheriffs departments backing away, Johnson in November replaced Secure Communities with PEP. It limited the use of detainers and shifted the emphasis to notification requests, under which ICE will ask to be notified 48 hours before an immigrant is released from custody. In another key change, ICE will file the requests in cases where the immigrant has been convicted of a crime; before, the requests included those only charged.\par \par \uc2 The new program is part of a broader shift in \uc2 DHS\uc2 's priorities in which the department has been narrowing enforcement efforts to three groups of illegal migrants: convicted criminals, terrorism threats or those who recently crossed the southwest border.\par \par \uc2 But pro-immigrant groups are questioning PEP, saying it will further undermine police efforts to gain trust from immigrant communities. Others are raising new legal concerns, especially about the continuing use of detainers. Partly in response to the court decisions, ICE added boxes to its detainer form, in which agents will indicate their "probable cause" for why the immigrant in police custody can be deported.\par \par \uc2 "Probable cause is not a series of checked boxes,'' said Kate Desormeau, a staff attorney for the ACLU Immigrants' Rights Project, who said ICE should get approval from a judge before taking custody of an immigrant. She said the \uc2 ACLU\uc2  is considering whether to bring legal action over PEP.\par \par \uc2 Johnson has been selling the new program for months and won support from Montgomery County, Md., Police Chief J. Thomas Manger, president of an association of major-city chiefs. "\uc2 DHS\uc2  and ICE heard the concerns and complaints from police around the country,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 The District, which scaled back its cooperation with ICE several years ago, has not said publicly whether it will participate in PEP.\par \par \uc2 Other large-city police chiefs and officials praised Johnson's outreach, including Nutter, the Philadelphia mayor. "I trust Secretary Johnson. He has been tremendously sensitive and focused on these issues,'' Nutter said, before adding that he has reached no decision about whether to participate in PEP.\par \par \uc2 In Cook County, Ill., which has also limited its cooperation with ICE, Board of Commissioners President Toni Preckwinkle said in a statement that she "greatly appreciates Secretary Johnson traveling to Chicago'' to meet with her about PEP.\par \par \uc2 But she has also not committed, saying the county "is open to continued dialogue and further meetings.''\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, officials in New York City, which has the nation's largest police department, said only that they are still in talks with \uc2 DHS\uc2 . But the city's policy severely limits its cooperation with ICE detainers, saying they must be accompanied by a federal warrant.\par \par \uc2 "Families will no longer be needlessly torn apart by ICE's dragnet enforcement efforts," New \uc2 York City Council\uc2  Speaker \uc2 Melissa Mark-Viverito\uc2  said before the policy was approved in October.\par \par \uc2 It took effect six days before \uc2 DHS\uc2  announced the PEP program.\par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com\par \par \uc2 WP20150804immigration0804\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020150804eb840000u\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The GOP has its knives out for \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Senate Republicans have said they will push for a procedural vote Monday\u160\'00\'A0to defund\u160\'00\'A0the women's reproductive rights group.\par \par \uc2 [Rand Paul: Defund Planned Parenthood, fund community health centers instead]\par \par \uc2 Ostensibly, the vote is tied to\u160\'00\'A0the four now infamous videos, filmed covertly by antiabortion activists and featuring\u160\'00\'A0\uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2  executives discussing in graphic detail how best to harvest fetal body parts.\par \par \uc2 Republicans have said they are shocked, disgusted and outraged over\u160\'00\'A0what they say is evidence of the group selling fetal tissue for profit. \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2  has denied the accusation and said the heavily edited videos are misleading.\par \par \uc2 Democrats have mostly backed the nonprofit and plan to block the vote. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton\u160\'00\'A0admitted the videos were "disturbing" but has also come out against Republican proposals to defund \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2 . The White House, meanwhile, has said the videos are the work of "extremists" and promised to veto any "ideologically driven" bill defunding \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 [Undercover video shows \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2  official discussing fetal organs used for research]\par \par \uc2 Whatever happens Monday, however, this latest showdown is about more than a few grainy videos.\par \par \uc2 It's really about \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2  itself: an organization that, for better or worse, has done more to change this country\u160\'00\'A0than almost any other in American history.\par \par \uc2 Lost in the frenzy of accusations and undercover footage\u160\'00\'A0is the fact that \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2  isn't just the largest provider of contraception in America. Instead, \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2  practically\u160\'00\'A0invented\u160\'00\'A0contraception. The organization's charismatic yet\u160\'00\'A0controversial founder, Margaret Sanger,\u160\'00\'A0made the birth control pill her life's obsession. With the help of a handful of outcast doctors and a basement full of test bunnies, Sanger launched a sexual revolution.\par \par \uc2 But Sanger and her organization\u160\'00\'A0didn't stop there.\par \par \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2  has been at the center of a half century of legal battles as well: Supreme Court-level skirmishes that redefined Americans' constitutional rights and led to some of the most important and polarizing decisions in U.S. history, from\u160\'00\'A0Roe v. Wade\u160\'00\'A0to\u160\'00\'A0Obergefell v. Hodges, the recent\u160\'00\'A0case that\u160\'00\'A0effectively legalized gay marriage.\par \par \uc2 From its clinics to the Supreme Court, \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2  has reshaped America.\par \par \uc2 [Opinion: \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2  and the barbarity of America]\par \par \uc2 Along the way, the nonprofit has also reshaped American political discourse. \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2  has\u160\'00\'A0persuaded liberal justices and politicians to\u160\'00\'A0expand women's\u160\'00\'A0reproductive rights. But it has also become a bugaboo for conservatives: an easy and perennial target that can be instantly transformed into public enemy No. 1\u160\'00\'A0in politically decisive moments.\par \par \uc2 "\uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2 \u160\'00\'A0has become a lightning rod," Jonathan Eig, the author of "The Birth of the Pill: How Four Crusaders Reinvented Sex and Launched a Revolution,"\u160\'00\'A0told The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "The bottom line is that in a very short amount of time, the pill and birth control have shaken up the world dramatically, maybe more dramatically than any other invention in our time,"\u160\'00\'A0Eig said. "That leads to some fallout. There are always going to be some people who resent that and that leads to some backlash.\par \par \uc2 "I think this is part of the backlash," he said of the latest \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2  showdown.\par \par \uc2 The story of \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2  begins with Sanger, a woman Eig described in his book as "a sexy slip of a woman, a redheaded fireball of lust and curiosity" who was also doggedly obsessive in her efforts to liberate women.\par \par \uc2 Sanger was born in 1879 to a politically progressive family in the factory town of Corning, N.Y. Her mother had 11 children, a fact that Sanger blamed for her mother's early death at age 50, according to Eig.\par \par \uc2 Sanger\u160\'00\'A0enrolled in nursing school but longed for more. "I wanted a world of action," she wrote. "I longed for romance, dancing, wooing, experience."\par \par \uc2 Despite her dreams and reservations, she married young and moved to New York City. It was in the teeming immigrant cauldron of Greenwich Village that Sanger would witness the toll childbirth took on her mother, only on a much greater scale.\par \par \uc2 "Sanger was astonished by the poverty and the misery: children sick, dirty, and underfed; tuberculosis rampant; and women seemingly unaware of how their own bodies worked and the risks of repeated pregnancies and venereal disease," Eig wrote. "She watched women die because their bodies could not hold up against the strain of producing so many babies in such poor conditions, or because they used primitive birth-control devices that cause infection, or because butchers posing as abortionists botched their jobs."\par \par \uc2 Abortion dates back to at least 1500 B.C. and the use of\u160\'00\'A0tampons covered in honey and crushed dates, according to Eig. But in Sanger's time, the remedies women resorted to were more ruthless: Lysol, lye, gunpowder, leeches, needles, poison, hammers to the abdomen or simply throwing one's self down the stairs.\par \par \uc2 These horrors led Sanger to an elegantly simple but maddeningly elusive solution: a pill that a woman could take \u8212\'20\'14 without a man's involvement \u8212\'20\'14 to control if and when she had children.\par \par \uc2 Just as important, the pill would allow women to have sex for pleasure \u8212\'20\'14 a truly radical idea for a country still rooted in Victorian ideas of femininity.\par \par \uc2 Sanger knew how revolutionary such an invention could be.\par \par \uc2 "She was beginning to believe if sex were something disconnected from childbirth, women might be liberated in ways they'd never imagined," Eig wrote. "Marriage would change. Human dynamics would change. The meaning of family would change. Career and educational opportunities for women would change."\par \par \uc2 (Sanger, it should be pointed out, has been criticized for her\u160\'00\'A0ties to the eugenics movement. Some critics have accused her of racism, although historians have come to her defense.\u160\'00\'A0"I don't think that's fair," Eig said of the accusations. "She did open work in Harlem and had W.E.B. DuBois on her board of directors. I think she worked with the eugenicists because they had some overlapping goals. I think it's easy from today's standards to say that she was a racist but by the standards of her day, I don't think you'd say that. So I think it's\u160\'00\'A0a cheap shot.")\par \par \uc2 Sanger opened the first birth control clinic in Brooklyn in 1916, which was raided just 10 days later. Sanger was arrested and charged with the illegal distribution of birth-control products but claimed she was a political prisoner and refused to be fingerprinted.\par \par \uc2 Five years later, she founded the\u160\'00\'A0American Birth Control League, which\u160\'00\'A0was eventually\u160\'00\'A0renamed\u160\'00\'A0\uc2 Planned Parenthood Federation of America\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 For all her adult life, Sanger sought a "magic pill" to liberate women. She even experimented with herbs from Fiji, Eig wrote. But it was in 1950, at age 71, that Sanger would finally seize upon a practical solution.\par \par \uc2 By then, Sanger was famous. \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2  centers had slowly appeared in most American cities, although they could only offer condoms (which required a man's cooperation) or\u160\'00\'A0less effective contraception such as diaphragms, douches and early versions of\u160\'00\'A0intrauterine devices (IUDs).\par \par \uc2 Post-war America was booming, including the sciences. And a new technique suddenly made it possible to mass produce progesterone, a hormone key to\u160\'00\'A0pregnancy.\par \par \uc2 Sanger approached a down-and-out scientist named Gregory "Goody" Pincus about using progesterone for birth control pills. Using a minuscule budget of $2,000, a cramped basement laboratory and a herd\u160\'00\'A0of rabbits as test subjects, Pincus and his small team created "the pill."\par \par \uc2 It took five years to perfect the formula and almost as long to win government approval. But in 1960, the\u160\'00\'A0the \uc2 Food and Drug Administration\uc2  (\uc2 FDA\uc2 ) approved the pill as a contraceptive.\par \par \uc2 It didn't take long for contraception cases to work their way up to the Supreme Court. In\u160\'00\'A01961, America's top court refused to rule on a lawsuit\u160\'00\'A0challenging\u160\'00\'A0Connecticut's law prohibiting contraception. The non-decision was a blow to the women's rights movement, but it was only temporary.\par \par \uc2 Four years later, the same court would hand Margaret Sanger \u8212\'20\'14 now near death \u8212\'20\'14 and her movement a stunning victory.\par \par \uc2 Estelle Griswold, executive director of the Planned Parenthood League of Connecticut, sued the state to allow her to distribute contraception (she had been arrested for doing so against state law).\par \par \uc2 Griswold was not a radical, however, but a seasoned civil rights activist.\u160\'00\'A0And her lawsuit was a carefully crafted test case designed by the national birth control movement to upend the nearly nationwide ban\u160\'00\'A0on contraception.\par \par \uc2 Although unknown to most Americans, Griswold v. Connecticut would arguably become one of the most important Supreme Court cases of the 20th century.\par \par \uc2 On June 7, 1965, the court ruled 7-to-2 in favor of Griswold. Although the decision initially only enabled married couples to access birth control, that right would soon be opened to unmarried women as well.\par \par \uc2 Margaret Sanger's vision had been fulfilled.\par \par \uc2 But Griswold v. Connecticut\u160\'00\'A0would have an even greater impact on America, sowing cultural conflict and court battles for years to come.\par \par \uc2 That's because the case gave "birth to the modern right to privacy," according to Yale law professor Reva B. Siegel. In a recent article titled "How Conflict Entrenched the Right to Privacy," Siegel spelled out Griswold's incredible impact on America.\par \par \uc2 "From Griswold's understanding of 'liberty' grew the right to\u160\'00\'A0make decisions about abortion, and the right to engage in same-sex sex," she wrote.\par \par \uc2 "Over the ensuing decades, pushed by growing movements debating the decriminalization\u160\'00\'A0of abortion and the decriminalization of same-sex sex, the Supreme\u160\'00\'A0Court progressively expanded Griswold's reach, first extending the right\u160\'00\'A0to contraception to unmarried persons in the 1972 case of Eisenstadt v. Baird\u160\'00\'A0and then declaring in the 1973 case of Roe v. Wade that the 'right of privacy . . .\u160\'00\'A0is broad enough to encompass a woman's decision whether or not to terminate\u160\'00\'A0her pregnancy,'" Siegel wrote.\par \par \uc2 Roe v. Wade, in particular, was a pivotal moment in American politics. It enabled\u160\'00\'A0\uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2  and other clinics to openly and legally perform\u160\'00\'A0abortions, in the process helping to launch the "culture war" that still rages in some form today, more than 40 years later.\par \par \uc2 The decision, stemming from Sanger's dogged pursuit of the pill, also shattered American politics.\par \par \uc2 "As we know, controversy escalated around these decisions," Siegel wrote. "Architects of the\u160\'00\'A0New Right appealed to conflicts over race, sex, and other 'social issues' of the\u160\'00\'A01970s to attract traditional Democratic voters to the ranks of the \uc2 Republican\u160\'00\'A0Party\uc2 . This strategy helped elect Ronald Reagan president in 1980 on a campaign\u160\'00\'A0platform promising to appoint 'judges at all levels of the judiciary who\u160\'00\'A0respect traditional family values and the sanctity of innocent human life.'\u160\'00\'A0Once in office, President Reagan set out to nominate judges who would roll\u160\'00\'A0back liberal judicial decisions, elevating William Rehnquist to Chief Justice and\u160\'00\'A0appointing \uc2 Sandra Day O'Connor\uc2  and Antonin Scalia to the Supreme Court."\par \par \uc2 In 1986, this increasingly conservative court ruled 5-to-4 to limit the privacy doctrine and uphold a state law against\u160\'00\'A0sodomy. The case, Bowers v. Hardwick, "signaled\u160\'00\'A0that Roe's future was at risk," Siegel wrote.\par \par \uc2 A year later, the court looked poised\u160\'00\'A0to shift even further to the right. Reagan nominated Robert Bork to Supreme Court. Bork was a fierce critic of the Griswold decision, calling it \u8212\'20\'14 in a phrase that echoes today \u8212\'20\'14 an "'unprincipled' usurpation of democratic authority unauthorized by the Constitution's text,"\u160\'00\'A0according to Siegel.\par \par \uc2 But, in what\u160\'00\'A0would become a milestone for American politics and constitutional jurisprudence, Bork was famously grilled by the Senate Judiciary Committee, led by then-Sen. \uc2 Joe Biden\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Backed by civil rights and reproductive rights groups, including \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2 , Biden famously asked Bork if he would allow\u160\'00\'A0the government to tell "a married couple . . . what they can or cannot do about birth control in their bedroom."\par \par \uc2 "After days of televised hearings, many Senators and commentators pronounced Judge Bork as 'outside the mainstream,' polls ran against Judge Bork's confirmation, and the Senate voted decisively with 42 senators voting in favor of, and 58 voting against, confirming him to the Supreme Court," Siegel wrote.\par \par \uc2 Bork's failure would have a double impact on the Supreme Court. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who would prove to be the swing vote in many left-leaning decisions, would take his place on the court. Just as important, even conservative nominees like Chief Justice \uc2 John G. Roberts Jr\uc2 . and Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. would have to publicly affirm the Griswold decision before taking the nation's highest bench.\par \par \uc2 "In short, the wide-ranging conflict over Judge Bork's confirmation helped entrench Griswold," Siegel wrote. "After this great conflict, subsequent nominees concluded that Griswold, like Brown, was part of the constitutional canon \u8212\'20\'14 accepted as mainstream."\par \par \uc2 In other words, a woman's right to contraception was untouchable.\par \par \uc2 (The Griswold decision would go on to\u160\'00\'A0have even wider effects on America. As presciently predicted by Siegel in her article, published in March, the Supreme Court cited Griswold prominently in its June 25, 2015, Obergefell v. Hodges ruling that legalized same-sex marriage across the country.)\par \par \uc2 But birth control's untouchable status didn't mean \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2  stopped being\u160\'00\'A0a perennial target of the GOP.\par \par \uc2 Just the opposite.\par \par \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2 's crucial role not only in providing abortions but also in inventing the pill, establishing a woman's right to privacy and undermining Bork has ensured that the nonprofit is one of the top public enemies for\u160\'00\'A0conservatives.\par \par \uc2 Starting shortly after Roe v. Wade, \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2  clinics became literal targets for some antiabortion activists. Over the years, several of the organization's clinics have been set on fire. One was rammed by\u160\'00\'A0a man in an SUV.\par \par \uc2 The attacks are down from their peak in the '70s and '80s but still continue. In 2012, a \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2  clinic in the small town of\u160\'00\'A0Grand Chute, Wis., was damaged by a homemade explosive device placed on its windowsill. A year later, a\u160\'00\'A0man who said he opposed abortion was arrested after attacking a \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2  clinic in Indiana with an ax.\par \par \uc2 Increasingly, however, antiabortion activists have taken nonviolent\u160\'00\'A0and\u160\'00\'A0technologically savvy approaches to attacking \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 In a 2000 incident\u160\'00\'A0almost identical to the present controversy, an antiabortion group claimed to have exposed the illegal sale of fetal tissue by a \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2  clinic in Kansas.\u160\'00\'A0The \uc2 FBI\uc2  looked into the matter, however, and concluded that the clinic\u160\'00\'A0did not break any laws.\par \par \uc2 In 2011, another incident\u160\'00\'A0involving \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2  became a national scandal. Using\u160\'00\'A0the same undercover video tactics that brought down ACORN in 2009, antiabortion activists posing as a pimp and a prostitute\u160\'00\'A0recorded a New Jersey Planned Parenthood clinic\u160\'00\'A0manager apparently advising the pair on how to obtain services for \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  prostitutes and sex workers as young as 14.\par \par \uc2 [\uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2  fires worker caught on video]\par \par \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2  said it was "shocked" by the video and fired the employee, but the fallout was serious. Republicans in\u160\'00\'A0Congress announced they were investigating the nonprofit, which, in turn, led Susan G. Komen, a leading breast-cancer charity, to pull its funding from \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 [Susan G. Komen stops \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2  funding: Who does the decision hurt more?]\par \par \uc2 The current scandal is a near carbon copy of its predecessors, with undercover video and heavy \u8212\'20\'14 \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2  says\u160\'00\'A0misleading \u8212\'20\'14 editing used to discredit the organization.\par \par \uc2 "The attempt is to make it an emotional argument as opposed to a rational one, because rationally there is no argument," Eig said. "\uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2  isn't doing anything illegal. This country makes abortion legal. Of course, there are some people who would rather that not be the case, and I understand that, but they are not attacking it legally, they are attacking it emotionally."\par \par \uc2 [How \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2  videos set off a renewed wave of activism on abortion]\par \par \uc2 Eig admitted that it is a "tough moment" for \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2  because\u160\'00\'A0"the publicity has not made them look good. Nobody wants to hear the lurid details of any medical procedure," he said.\par \par \uc2 But\u160\'00\'A0by threatening to defund \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2 , the GOP runs the risk of looking like its values are straight from the Victorian era, he said.\par \par \uc2 "I think the attitudes are the same" as back then, Eig\u160\'00\'A0said. "We are very uncomfortable with the idea of women having sex for pleasure. It's okay for men. You look at a Viagra ad and it's clearly saying that it's okay for men to have sex for fun, but you could never run an ad like that for a women's contraceptive product. It's a completely double standard,\u160\'00\'A0and I think that's really at the root of a lot of these attacks not just on \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2  but on reproductive rights."\par \par \uc2 Eig went as far as to argue that "the straight line that runs through all these controversies, from 1916, when they opened the first clinic, to today, is sexism."\par \par \uc2 "Some of it, of course, is religious and moral and there are people opposed to abortion on religious or moral grounds, but I still think that none of this would be happening if we were talking about medical treatments that were available to men," he said. "I don't think that men would allow anyone to take those medical options away from them and I don't think you'd see an attack on a group like \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2  if not for sexism."\par \par \uc2 Republicans disagree, claiming that \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2  has simply broken the law. Senator and presidential candidate Ted Cruz of Texas has called the nonprofit "a criminal enterprise that sells\u160\'00\'A0the body parts of unborn children."\par \par \uc2 Amidst the undercover videos and allegations on display on Monday, one thing\u160\'00\'A0will be incontestable: \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2  remains at the center of America's ever-raging culture war.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020150803eb83002s2\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 LAREDO, Texas\u8212\'20\'14As \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 's private jet headed here for a Thursday afternoon visit to the U.S.-Mexico border, Rick Perry stepped up his attacks on his Republican presidential rival.\par \par \uc2 A day after describing Trump as "a cancer on conservatism" during a speech in Washington, the former governor of Texas ripped into the New York businessman, saying he employed illegal immigrants at the same time that he attacked Mexican immigrants as drug traffickers and rapists.\par \par \uc2 "As a known employer of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  labor, \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 's record on border security is non-existent at best and a farce at worst," Perry said. "It's going to take more than a day trip for him to convince the American people he is anything but a hypocrite when it comes to border security."\par \par \uc2 Trump promised in his campaign announcement speech to build a fence across the southern border of United States and to make the Mexican government pay for it.\par \par \uc2 "After weeks of talk, today \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  will finally make his first trip to the Texas-Mexico border to see Texas' work to fill in the gaps left in border security by the federal government," Perry said in his statement, sent from the state capital in Austin.\par \par \uc2 [Rick Perry: \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 's campaign a 'barking carnival act' and a 'cancer on conservatism' ]\par \par \uc2 "While he is there, I hope he will explain to the people of Laredo why he thinks they should be on the hook to secure our country's border with Mexico, rather than the federal government," said perry. "I hope he will explain to the Hispanic Americans he meets why he thinks they are rapists and murderers. And I hope he will apologize for ridiculing the selfless work of the men and women of the \uc2 Texas Department of Public Safety\uc2 , \uc2 Texas Rangers\uc2 , Texas Game Wardens and Texas National Guard to protect our communities in the face of the federal government's failure to secure the border."\par \par \uc2 Trump attacked Perry for not doing more to secure the border while in office, said publicly that the former Texas governor should be required to take an IQ test, and on Wednesday called Perry a hypocrite for seeking out his support when he ran in 2012 only to criticize him now.\par \par \uc2 A day after Perry's speech blasting Trump, his campaign is offering surrogates up to reporters to tout his record on border security. The back-and-forth has helped elevate Perry's profile, as he teeters on the edge of qualifying for the first GOP presidential debate next month, which is open to the candidates who place in the top 10 in recent national polls.\par \par \uc2 Perry's full statement highlights his own work on border security in the final years of his 14-year governorship. he also defended his decision to spend resources on the Rio Grande Valley, rather than the area around Laredo.\par \par \uc2 "Unlike \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 , I have been battling the federal government over border security for years," the ex-governor wrote in his statement. "Border security is a federal responsibility, but when it became clear Washington wouldn't act, I told President Obama if he wouldn't secure the border, Texas would. During my time in office, Texas dedicated nearly $1 billion to border security, and we focused our resources on the areas that needed it most \u8212\'20\'14 like the Rio Grande Sector, which accounts for more than 50 percent of illegal crossings on the entire U.S.-Mexico border, and more than 70 percent of illegal border crossings in Texas alone."\par \par \uc2 A Trump spokeswoman declined to comment on Perry's statement.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020150723eb7n005mt\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved   \par \par \uc2 Here's how area members of Congress voted on major issues last week, as reported by Voterama in Congress.\par \par \uc2 For: 241 / Against: 179\par \par \uc2 The House voted to deny certain law enforcement grants to so-called "sanctuary cities" that decline to act as an arm of federal immigration enforcement. The GOP-drafted bill (HR 3009) is a response to a recent killing in San Francisco, a sanctuary city, in which an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  with felony convictions allegedly gunned down Kathryn Steinle after city authorities released him from custody. Officials in sanctuary cities say that to assist with federal immigration enforcement would undercut community-policing efforts that depend on rapport with immigrant populations. Supporters of the bill say cities are required by law to comply with federal requests that they detain illegal immigrants. A yes vote was to send the bill to the Senate.\par \par \uc2 For: 181 / Against: 239\par \par \uc2 The House defeated a bid by Democrats to block any funding cuts under HR 3009 (above) that would reduce a city's deployment of police on the beat or raise its crime rate with respect to domestic violence, sex crimes or crimes against children. A yes vote was to adopt the motion, which, had it prevailed, would have immediately amended the bill.\par \par \uc2 For: 258 / Against: 166\par \par \uc2 The House passed a GOP-drafted bill (HR 1734) that would give states rather than the \uc2 Environmental Protection Agency\uc2  primary authority to regulate coal ash discharged as waste by the nation's 500-plus coal-fired power plants. The bill would put states in charge of permits and enforcement under a new \uc2 EPA\uc2  rule for regulating coal ash impounded in ponds or landfills near these plants. The federal rule takes effect Oct. 19. Addressing factors such as the structural integrity and location of storage sites, it is designed to protect drinking water, groundwater and air quality from ash containing elements such as arsenic, cadmium, lead, chromium and selenium. The \uc2 EPA\uc2  began its rule-making process in response to a December 2008 spill at a \uc2 Tennessee Valley Authority\uc2  facility in Kingston, Tenn., in which coal-ash sludge spread over 300 acres and into the Emory and Clinch rivers. A yes vote was to send the bill to the Senate.\par \par \uc2 For: 192 / Against: 231\par \par \uc2 The House refused to require operators of coal ash impoundment sites to provide notification and alternative sources of safe drinking water to properties within one-half mile of the sites whose wells show signs of coal-ash contamination. The Democratic-sponsored amendment was offered to HR 1734 (above). A yes vote was to adopt the amendment.\par \par \uc2 VOLUNTARY GMO FOOD LABELING For: 275 / Against: 150\par \par \uc2 The House passed a bill (HR 1599) that would establish a system of voluntary state-administered labeling requirements for foods that contain genetically modified organisms (GMOs). The bill preempts existing and future state or local laws that establish mandatory labeling of genetically engineered foods. There are currently no federal requirements for GMO labeling. A yes vote favored a voluntary state-by-state approach to labeling GMO foods.\par \par \uc2 For: 123 / Against: 303\par \par \uc2 The House defeated an amendment to HR 1599 (above) that sought to require mandatory federally administered labeling of foods containing genetically modified organisms (GMOs). This would replace the underlying bill's voluntary state-level approach. A yes vote was to establish federally mandated labeling of foods containing GMOs.\par \par \uc2 GMO FOODS LABELED 'NATURAL' For: 163 / Against: 262\par \par \uc2 The House refused to prohibit food labeled as "natural" from containing generically modified ingredients. The vote affirmed wording in HR 1599 (above) that allows \uc2 Food and Drug Administration\uc2  and \uc2 U.S. Department of Agriculture\uc2  definitions of "natural" to include GMO foods. A yes vote was to prohibit foods containing GMOs from being labeled as "natural."\par \par \uc2 For: 62 / Against: 36\par \par \uc2 The Senate agreed to start debate on a bill (HR 22) that would authorize $317 billion over six years for highway and mass transit construction projects. Because the Highway Trust Fund is projected to raise only $240 billion over the next six years to finance these projects, the bill faces a shortfall of $77 billion that would be funded by revenue increases or spending cuts yet to be determined. If the bill clears the Senate, it would have to be reconciled with a House-passed measure to fund transportation programs only through Dec. 18. A yes vote was to advance the transportation bill.\par \par \uc2 2015 Thomas Voting Reports \par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com\par \par \uc2 WP20150726rollcall0730\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020150726eb7q00055\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 A-Section\par {\*\bkmkstart toc54}{\*\bkmkend toc54}\b \uc2 No rest for candidates in summer of discontent\b0\par\par\uc2 Dan Balz   \par \uc2 1,225 \uc2 words\par \uc2 26 July 2015\par \uc2 The Washington Post\par \uc2 WP\par \uc2 FINAL\par A02\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2015, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved   \par \par \uc2 Dissatisfaction and protest are roiling the politics of summer 2015. They are evident in the response to the angry rhetoric from \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 , in the crowds that come to hear Bernie Sanders bash Wall Street and in the rallies demanding racial justice. For presidential candidates, there is no safe harbor. Ignore the mood at your peril; engage it at your peril.\par \par \uc2 The discontent is real, whether economic, racial or cultural. It knows no particular ideological boundaries. It currently disrupts both the Republican and Democratic parties. It reflects grievances that long have been bubbling. It reflects, too, the impatience with many political leaders - what they say and how they say it.\par \par \uc2 The economic collapse of 2008 continues to ripple through the lives of many families, despite the drop in unemployment. Steady but slow growth has not been balm enough to give these families, many of whom see a system rife with inequity, much optimism about the future. Instead, they see the American Dream as part of the nation's past.\par \par \uc2 The uproar over illegal immigration underscores the anger over what many still see as broken borders, an issue heightened by the recent killing in San Francisco of a young woman by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  with a criminal record who had been deported but returned to the country. But immigration also is tied to the broader cultural reaction to demographic changes that continue to remake the face of the country and generate tensions that are at the heart of political differences.\par \par \uc2 Racial issues remain front and center, whether the killings in a black church in Charleston by a young man who wanted to start a race war or repeated episodes that have raised hard questions of how police and law enforcement officials treat African Americans. All this is a reminder that, almost seven years after the election of the nation's first black president and all of the progress that made that possible, work remains to be done.\par \par \uc2 It is tempting to try to dismiss Trump for what he is - a reality TV showman who talks as much about himself as anything else. The support he is receiving in national polls, however, suggests more than just a response to a celebrity with a loud voice. He has tapped into something.\par \par \uc2 [Trump takes his campaign to the border]\par \par \uc2 Trump is not particularly conservative - or, more accurately, he seems to have no fixed ideology. He amplifies dissatisfaction without proposing real solutions to the country's problems, other than building a big wall. Yet he speaks about things in a language so blunt and uncharacteristic of politicians that it wins visceral approval from disaffected Americans.\par \par \uc2 Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) says Trump brings out the "crazies" in the \uc2 Republican Party\uc2  on the issue of immigration. In fact, Trump's candidacy highlights the reality that there is an unresolved debate within the GOP about what to do about it. This is an argument of long standing. Each time McCain and other Republicans have stepped up to solve it with a comprehensive solution, they have been rebuffed by the party's conservative base. Trump has scratched at the wound again this summer.\par \par \uc2 Sanders, the independent senator from Vermont who is running for the Democratic nomination, seems to be an extension of the Occupy Wall Street movement that began four years ago. That movement struggled to find political traction the way the tea party movement had two years earlier. But it nonetheless had an indelible impact on the political dialogue by framing the economic debate as the 99 percent vs. the 1 percent.\par \par \uc2 Obama carefully subsumed the unrest represented by the Occupy Wall Street movement into his middle-class message in 2012. In \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2 , he found the perfect foil, an opponent he portrayed as an out-of-touch plutocrat. That was enough to win reelection.\par \par \uc2 Yet four years later, the Democrats find themselves debating not just Republicans about the economy but one another, as well. They debate how far left they should move to deal with the issues of income and wealth inequality and the power of what Sanders calls "the billionaire class."\par \par \uc2 [Clinton outlines economic plans]\par \par \uc2 Hillary Rodham Clinton is part of the way there in responding to the economic unrest, at least rhetorically. Sanders says that she and he continue to have major disagreements on the particulars of what to do. The outpouring of support he has seen at events around the country and the recent rise in his poll numbers in New Hampshire and Iowa will maintainthe pressure on Clinton to keep responding. She will try to calibrate the extent of her move to the left.\par \par \uc2 The signs of discontent have flummoxed many of the presidential candidates. Each party wants this election to be about the weaknesses and vulnerabilities of the other. Yet the intraparty strife cannot easily be ignored.\par \par \uc2 Republican candidates were slow to challenge Trump's language on immigration - both those who strongly disagree with his positions and those who generally agree. Engaging Trump carries risks. He swings back hard, sometimes wildly but sometimes with the nimbleness and precision of a practiced politician.\par \par \uc2 Many Republicans want Trump to go away. But they are wary about trying to hasten his fall, because they fear they will pay too high a price among those for whom he has provided a voice.\par \par \uc2 Sanders and former Maryland governor Martin O'Malley went to the Netroots Nation convention a week ago, no doubt looking to find a sympathetic audience for their populist economic message. It was an event, after all, that Clinton did not attend, for the obvious reason that she likely would not have been welcomed.\par \par \uc2 Instead, though, Sanders and O'Malley were caught unprepared for the interruptions from the Black Lives Matter movement, and neither looked particularly adept or comfortable as they responded. Sanders seemed to throw up his hands in frustration over the interruption. Then he invoked his civil rights work as evidence that he stood with African Americans. O'Malley said that "all lives matter" and later apologized. Clinton was the lucky one for not having attended, but she will not escape the issue, either.\par \par \uc2 [Why Democrats are struggling to grasp Black Lives Matter]\par \par \uc2 Few Republicans expect Trump to become their party's nominee. They worry that his candidacy alone, if left to run for months, could condemn them to another defeat in November 2016, even if he eventually disappears. Their other concern is that Trump might eventually run as an independent, in which case he could drain more than enough votes from their nominee to cost them the general election.\par \par \uc2 Not many Democrats yet think Sanders has the staying power to defeat Clinton, even if he can give her a good scare. Strange things happen in nomination contests. But Clinton's advisers vow they will not be caught by surprise by an insurgency from the left.\par \par \uc2 Even if both Trump and Sanders end up merely as interesting characters rather than long-distance runners, the unrest that has contributed to the attention they are now receiving will remain. Distrust of the political class will infect the campaign, adding to the burdens the major party nominees will carry into the general election and beyond. It is embedded in the politics of now.\par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com\par \par \uc2 WP20150726sundaytake0726\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020150726eb7q0002x\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The House voted Thursday to punish local jurisdictions \u8212\'20\'14 known as "sanctuary cities" \u8212\'20\'14 that defy federal immigration authorities in order to protect immigrants living illegally in the United States.\par \par \uc2 The 241-to-179 vote, which was backed by Republican leaders and fell largely along party lines, is the most dramatic action taken by Congress after a spate of new attention on illegal immigration sparked by the July\u160\'00\'A01 killing of a 32-year-old California woman.\par \par \uc2 The shooting of Kathryn Steinle on a San Francisco pier, allegedly at the hands of an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who was released from local police custody despite a detention request from federal authorities, has sparked a national debate \u8212\'20\'14 one that has been turbocharged by the remarks of billionaire Republican presidential candidate \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Steinle's father testified before a Senate committee Tuesday and again before a House committee Thursday, calling on Congress to take action. Her accused killer, Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, has seven felony convictions since 1991 and has been deported five times from the United States to Mexico.\par \par \uc2 "Due to disjointed law and basic incompetence on many levels, the U.S. has suffered a \u173\'00\'ADself-inflicted wound by the hand of a person who never should have been on the streets of this country," Jim Steinle said Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 Under the legislation that passed Thursday, cities that do not comply fully with federal immigration authorities would be ineligible for various Justice Department law enforcement grants, including a program that reimburses local jurisdictions for the cost of detaining illegal immigrants accused of or convicted of crimes.\par \par \uc2 "The American people have the right to not give their tax dollars to municipalities and states that do not follow federal law," said Rep. Duncan D. Hunter (R-Calif.), the bill's author. "The fact that San Francisco and L.A. and other cities disagree with the politics of federal enforcement does not give them a free pass to subvert the law."\par \par \uc2 House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) also spoke out Thursday, citing the "preventable" Steinle killing. "The House is acting today to put state and local officials on notice that we'll no longer allow them to decide how and when to enforce our nation's laws," he told reporters.\par \par \uc2 Some law enforcement organizations, civil rights groups and the U.S. Conference of Mayors have pushed back on efforts to crack down on sanctuary cities, arguing that new policies would be counterproductive by undermining the trust between local law enforcement agencies and the communities they serve.\par \par \uc2 "I do not think we should punish and strip grants and federal funding from local law enforcement, cities and towns who are promoting community policing, public safety and the U.S. Constitution ahead of racial profiling and prejudice," Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) said during a procedural hearing Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 It is unclear how many jurisdictions could be affected by the House bill. One group that advocates more-restrictive immigration policies, the \uc2 Center for Immigration Studies\uc2 , has identified 276 states, counties and municipalities with various sanctuary-type laws. A group that opposes stronger enforcement, the \uc2 Immigrant Legal Resource Center\uc2 , has identified more than 360 jurisdictions.\par \par \uc2 Many Democrats who have spoken out in recent days have connected the legislation to Trump's remarks following the Steinle slaying that the Mexican government was "sending people that have lots of problems." Added Trump: "They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists."\par \par \uc2 One Democratic leader, Rep. Xavier Becerra (D-Calif.), referred to the legislation as the "\uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  Act."\par \par \uc2 Democrats also lambasted Republicans for bringing the bill directly to the House floor rather than holding a series of hearings and passing it through a committee. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who represents the area where Steinle was killed, called the bill an "inappropriate attempt to address a very serious situation."\par \par \uc2 House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) defended the move this week, calling the bill "the first bite of the apple" on the issue of illegal immigration, with more legislation probably to come.\par \par \uc2 "Those cities that decide what federal laws they want to uphold and those they do not, I think, have a real problem with the rest of the country," he said. "I think you're seeing a desire within America that .\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09. a federal law should be a federal law and you can't pick and choose."\par \par \uc2 Senate action is less certain. Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has introduced "Kate's Law" in honor of Steinle and has announced intentions to move it through his committee.\par \par \uc2 That bill would make a wider variety of grants unavailable to sanctuary cities than the House bill and would increase penalties for individuals who reenter the country after having been deported. Some Senate Democrats, including San Francisco native Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), also say some less-sweeping legislative action may be necessary.\par \par \uc2 But it is unclear when any measure might make it to the floor of the Senate, which is expected to be tied up with transportation legislation until congressional summer recess begins in August.\par \par \uc2 "On the timing of that, I couldn't tell you right now," Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) said Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 The White House issued a veto threat Thursday after spokesman Josh Earnest said the day prior that President \uc2 Obama\uc2  would much prefer Congress act on a comprehensive immigration reform package, like the one passed by a Democratic Senate in 2013. The Republican House never took up that legislation.\par \par \uc2 "These are the kinds of enforcement provisions that were included in the law that Republicans blocked," Earnest said. "So when they raise concerns about how effectively our immigration system is working to keep the community safe, they have no one to blame but themselves."\par \par \uc2 mike.debonis@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020150723eb7n004mw\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 LAREDO, Tex. \u8212\'20\'14 A defiant \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 , visiting the U.S. border with Mexico here Thursday, said again that he will not apologize for his hard-line rhetoric on illegal immigration or back away from his plan to build a wall between the two nations.\par \par \uc2 During a whirlwind visit \u8212\'20\'14 it was less than three hours from when his jet touched down to when it took off \u8212\'20\'14 Trump blazed around in a presidential-style motorcade that included seven SUVs and even more police cars. Local officers blocked off roads, including Interstate 35, for Trump's entourage.\par \par \uc2 The Republican presidential candidate, leading the GOP field in national polls but increasingly under fire from the establishment wing of his party, said repeatedly that he had been told he would be in "great danger" if he visited this town of 236,000 in southern Texas \u8212\'20\'14 even though Laredo, which is roughly 96 percent Hispanic, has a significantly lower murder rate than Trump's home town of New York City. He would not say who had told him that he was at risk.\par \par \uc2 At the World Trade Bridge, where a long line of 18-wheelers queued up to enter the United States, Trump spent half an hour meeting with local leaders \u8212\'20\'14 none of whom seemed eager to endorse his signature prescription for border security.\par \par \uc2 Speaking to reporters after the meeting, with the crossing as a backdrop, Laredo City Manager Jesus Olivares said the border fence Trump has been calling for was not on their list of priorities.\par \par \uc2 "We don't think that's necessary at this time," he replied, with Trump looking on.\par \par \uc2 Asked whether that opinion would have an impact on his own, Trump said nothing had changed: "Not at all. .\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09. In certain sections, we have to have a wall."\par \par \uc2 On a windy day with temperatures over 100 degrees, Trump wore a blazer, white dress shoes and a white ball\u160\'00\'A0cap emblazoned with his campaign slogan, "Make America Great Again."\par \par \uc2 At every stop, his visit seemed to draw more journalists than locals. More than 100 reporters, with multiple camera crews in tow, chased after the former "Apprentice" star as soon as his jet touched down in Laredo, packing two charter buses for the drive to the border.\par \par \uc2 Border Patrol agents who had been slated to lead the tour backed out Thursday morning, citing the appearance of politicization. Trump accused unnamed officials in Washington of trying to silence them.\par \par \uc2 After his visit to the border, Trump stopped briefly to speak to a few dozen plainclothes Border Patrol agents and others in local law enforcement. He got a raucous reception, especially when he said that he would give agents more leeway to do their jobs if elected. He declined to elaborate on what that might mean.\par \par \uc2 Luis Villegas, a 28-year-old Border Patrol agent who said he has been on the force for eight years, cheered Trump loudly. He said he has never been politically active but has been galvanized by the mogul's stance on immigration. "I believe in what he's throwing out there," Villegas said.\par \par \uc2 Trump, meanwhile, took another shot at former Texas governor Rick Perry in his home state, calling him a "terrible" governor. "I'm not even sure he honestly understands what [border security] means," he said.\par \par \uc2 Perry, another GOP presidential contender, on Wednesday called Trump "a cancer on conservatism." The former governor's campaign made surrogates available Thursday to defend his record on border security as Perry issued another scathing statement slamming Trump.\par \par \uc2 "As a known employer of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  labor, \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 's record on border security is non-existent at best and a farce at worst," Perry said. "It's going to take more than a day trip for him to convince the American people he is anything but a hypocrite when it comes to border security."\par \par \uc2 About 50 Hispanic activists \u8212\'20\'14 a few waving Mexican flags \u8212\'20\'14 protested outside the terminal where Trump's private jet landed, pointing to his controversial remarks last month that many Mexicans who come to the United States illegally are drug dealers or rapists.\par \par \uc2 "The criminal element sells newspapers, but for every one of those there are hundreds of good Mexican nationals that .\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09. just want to work," said Jose Gonzalez, 67, a retired firefighter who was among the protesters.\par \par \uc2 Trump responded to questions about whether he should apologize for his remarks by saying again that he employs thousands of Hispanics, and that they "love" him.\par \par \uc2 "They were chanting for me at the airport," he said.\par \par \uc2 "There were plenty chanting against you," a reporter yelled back during his news conference.\par \par \uc2 "I didn't see them," Trump said.\par \par \uc2 A few minutes later, another reporter asked why the magnate would not apologize to the Hispanics he has offended.\par \par \uc2 "They weren't insulted," Trump said, "because the press misinterprets my words."\par \par \uc2 Trump ducked when asked what he would do with the 11\u160\'00\'A0million undocumented immigrants estimated to be in the United States.\par \par \uc2 "The first thing is to secure our borders," he said, "and after that we'll have plenty of time to talk about it."\par \par \uc2 james.hohmann@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020150724eb7o0002u\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved   \par \par \uc2 The House voted Thursday to punish local jurisdictions - known as "sanctuary cities" - that defy federal immigration authorities in order to protect immigrants living illegally in the United States.\par \par \uc2 The 241-to-179 vote, which was backed by Republican leaders and fell largely along party lines, is the most dramatic action taken by Congress after a spate of new attention on illegal immigration sparked by the July 1 killing of a 32-year-old California woman.\par \par \uc2 The shooting of Kathryn Steinle on a San Francisco pier, allegedly at the hands of an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who was released from local police custody despite a detention request from federal authorities, has sparked a national debate - one that has been turbocharged by the remarks of billionaire Republican presidential candidate \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 [California killing inflames debate on illegal immigrants, 'sanctuary cities']\par \par \uc2 Steinle's father testified before a Senate committee Tuesday and again before a House committee Thursday, calling on Congress to take action. Her accused killer, Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, has seven felony convictions since 1991 and has been deported five times from the United States to Mexico.\par \par \uc2 "Due to disjointed law and basic incompetence on many levels, the U.S. has suffered a self-inflicted wound by the hand of a person who never should have been on the streets of this country," Jim Steinle said Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 Under the legislation that passed Thursday, cities that do not comply fully with federal immigration authorities would be ineligible for various Justice Department law enforcement grants, including a program that reimburses local jurisdictions for the cost of detaining illegal immigrants accused of or convicted of crimes.\par \par \uc2 "The American people have the right to not give their tax dollars to municipalities and states that do not follow federal law," said Rep. Duncan D. Hunter (R-Calif.), the bill's author. "The fact that San Francisco and L.A. and other cities disagree with the politics of federal enforcement does not give them a free pass to subvert the law."\par \par \uc2 [Six big things to know about sanctuary cities]\par \par \uc2 House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) also spoke out Thursday, citing the "preventable" Steinle killing. "The House is acting today to put state and local officials on notice that we'll no longer allow them to decide how and when to enforce our nation's laws," he told reporters.\par \par \uc2 Some law enforcement organizations, civil rights groups and the U.S. Conference of Mayors have pushed back on efforts to crack down on sanctuary cities, arguing that new policies would be counterproductive by undermining the trust between local law enforcement agencies and the communities they serve.\par \par \uc2 "I do not think we should punish and strip grants and federal funding from local law enforcement, cities and towns who are promoting community policing, public safety and the U.S. Constitution ahead of racial profiling and prejudice," Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) said during a procedural hearing Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 It is unclear how many jurisdictions could be affected by the House bill. One group that advocates more-restrictive immigration policies, the \uc2 Center for Immigration Studies\uc2 , has identified 276 states, counties and municipalities with various sanctuary-type laws. A group that opposes stronger enforcement, the \uc2 Immigrant Legal Resource Center\uc2 , has identified more than 360 jurisdictions.\par \par \uc2 Many Democrats who have spoken out in recent days have connected the legislation to Trump's remarks following the Steinle slaying that the Mexican government was "sending people that have lots of problems." Added Trump: "They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists."\par \par \uc2 One Democratic leader, Rep. Xavier Becerra (D-Calif.), referred to the legislation as the "\uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  Act."\par \par \uc2 [ Top Mexican official blasts \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 's 'absurd' comments on migrants ]\par \par \uc2 Democrats also lambasted Republicans for bringing the bill directly to the House floor rather than holding a series of hearings and passing it through a committee. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who represents the area where Steinle was killed, called the bill an "inappropriate attempt to address a very serious situation."\par \par \uc2 House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) defended the move this week, calling the bill "the first bite of the apple" on the issue of illegal immigration, with more legislation probably to come.\par \par \uc2 "Those cities that decide what federal laws they want to uphold and those they do not, I think, have a real problem with the rest of the country," he said. "I think you're seeing a desire within America that . . . a federal law should be a federal law and you can't pick and choose."\par \par \uc2 Senate action is less certain. Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has introduced "Kate's Law" in honor of Steinle and has announced intentions to move it through his committee.\par \par \uc2 That bill would make a wider variety of grants unavailable to sanctuary cities than the House bill and would increase penalties for individuals who reenter the country after having been deported. Some Senate Democrats, including San Francisco native Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), also say some less-sweeping legislative action may be necessary.\par \par \uc2 But it is unclear when any measure might make it to the floor of the Senate, which is expected to be tied up with transportation legislation until congressional summer recess begins in August.\par \par \uc2 "On the timing of that, I couldn't tell you right now," Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) said Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 The White House issued a veto threat Thursday after spokesman Josh Earnest said the day prior that President \uc2 Obama\uc2  would much prefer Congress act on a comprehensive immigration reform package, like the one passed by a Democratic Senate in 2013. The Republican House never took up that legislation.\par \par \uc2 "These are the kinds of enforcement provisions that were included in the law that Republicans blocked," Earnest said. "So when they raise concerns about how effectively our immigration system is working to keep the community safe, they have no one to blame but themselves."\par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com \par \par \uc2 WP20150724sanctuary0724\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020150724eb7o0000l\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved   \par \par \uc2 LAREDO, Tex. - A defiant \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 , visiting the U.S. border with Mexico here Thursday, said again that he will not apologize for his hard-line rhetoric on illegal immigration or back away from his plan to build a wall between the two nations.\par \par \uc2 During a whirlwind visit - it was less than three hours from when his jet touched down to when it took off - Trump blazed around in a presidential-style motorcade that included seven SUVs and even more police cars. Local officers blocked off roads, including Interstate 35, for Trump's entourage.\par \par \uc2 The Republican presidential candidate, leading the GOP field in national polls but increasingly under fire from the establishment wing of his party, said repeatedly that he had been told he would be in "great danger" if he visited this town of 236,000 in southern Texas - even though Laredo, which is roughly 96 percent Hispanic, has a significantly lower murder rate than Trump's home town of New York City. He would not say who had told him that he was at risk.\par \par \uc2 [What the world thinks about America's infatuation with \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 ]\par \par \uc2 At the World Trade Bridge, where a long line of 18-wheelers queued up to enter the United States, Trump spent half an hour meeting with local leaders - none of whom seemed eager to endorse his signature prescription for border security.\par \par \uc2 Speaking to reporters after the meeting, with the crossing as a backdrop, Laredo City Manager Jesus Olivares said the border fence Trump has been calling for was not on their list of priorities.\par \par \uc2 "We don't think that's necessary at this time," he replied, with Trump looking on.\par \par \uc2 Asked whether that opinion would have an impact on his own, Trump said nothing had changed: "Not at all. . . . In certain sections, we have to have a wall."\par \par \uc2 On a windy day with temperatures over 100 degrees, Trump wore a blazer, white dress shoes and a white ball cap emblazoned with his campaign slogan, "Make America Great Again."\par \par \uc2 [Poll: Trump surges to big lead in GOP presidential race]\par \par \uc2 At every stop, his visit seemed to draw more journalists than locals. More than 100 reporters, with multiple camera crews in tow, chased after the former "Apprentice" star as soon as his jet touched down in Laredo, packing two charter buses for the drive to the border.\par \par \uc2 Border Patrol agents who had been slated to lead the tour backed out Thursday morning, citing the appearance of politicization. Trump accused unnamed officials in Washington of trying to silence them.\par \par \uc2 [Photos: Cutting ties with Trump: Who has dumped him and why]\par \par \uc2 After his visit to the border, Trump stopped briefly to speak to a few dozen plainclothes Border Patrol agents and others in local law enforcement. He got a raucous reception, especially when he said that he would give agents more leeway to do their jobs if elected. He declined to elaborate on what that might mean.\par \par \uc2 Luis Villegas, a 28-year-old Border Patrol agent who said he has been on the force for eight years, cheered Trump loudly. He said he has never been politically active but has been galvanized by the mogul's stance on immigration. "I believe in what he's throwing out there," Villegas said.\par \par \uc2 Trump, meanwhile, took another shot at former Texas governor Rick Perry in his home state, calling him a "terrible" governor. "I'm not even sure he honestly understands what [border security] means," he said.\par \par \uc2 Perry, another GOP presidential contender, on Wednesday called Trump "a cancer on conservatism." The former governor's campaign made surrogates available Thursday to defend his record on border security as Perry issued another scathing statement slamming Trump.\par \par \uc2 "As a known employer of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  labor, \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 's record on border security is non-existent at best and a farce at worst," Perry said. "It's going to take more than a day trip for him to convince the American people he is anything but a hypocrite when it comes to border security."\par \par \uc2 About 50 Hispanic activists - a few waving Mexican flags - protested outside the terminal where Trump's private jet landed, pointing to his controversial remarks last month that many Mexicans who come to the United States illegally are drug dealers or rapists.\par \par \uc2 "The criminal element sells newspapers, but for every one of those there are hundreds of good Mexican nationals that . . . just want to work," said Jose Gonzalez, 67, a retired firefighter who was among the protesters.\par \par \uc2 Trump responded to questions about whether he should apologize for his remarks by saying again that he employs thousands of Hispanics, and that they "love" him.\par \par \uc2 "They were chanting for me at the airport," he said.\par \par \uc2 "There were plenty chanting against you," a reporter yelled back during his news conference.\par \par \uc2 "I didn't see them," Trump said.\par \par \uc2 A few minutes later, another reporter asked why the magnate would not apologize to the Hispanics he has offended.\par \par \uc2 "They weren't insulted," Trump said, "because the press misinterprets my words."\par \par \uc2 Trump ducked when asked what he would do with the 11 million undocumented immigrants estimated to be in the United States.\par \par \uc2 "The first thing is to secure our borders," he said, "and after that we'll have plenty of time to talk about it."\par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com \par \par \uc2 WP20150724trump0724\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020150724eb7o0000m\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 right-turn\par {\*\bkmkstart toc59}{\*\bkmkend toc59}\b \uc2 How to handle a bully like Trump \b0\par\par\uc2 By Jennifer Rubin   \par \uc2 1,001 \uc2 words\par \uc2 19 July 2015\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2015, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 As the candidates who will qualify for the presidential debate in August begin their preparations, they are going to want to bone up on a range of policy issues and make sure they have coherent answers to hard questions. (Now that Syria is a mess what do we do about it? If a Supreme Court vacancy opens on Day One, who is at the top of your replacement list? Has the president pardoned too few or too many people?) Equally important will be a game plan for neutralizing \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Even before Trump self-destructed on Saturday, we saw candidates like Sens. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), as well as former Texas governor Rick Perry, call out Trump for talking nonsense and for racist language. At the other end of the spectrum, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) has been obsequious, slobbering over Trump with praise and refusing to rebuke his racist characterization of immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Now that Trump has attacked war hero Sen. JohnMcCain (R-Ariz.) and other POWs, those who shrank from criticizing him when he went after Hispanics are revealed to be near-sighted and, in fact, hypocritical. Once you excuse or ignore hatred against one group, you've lost the moral authority to knock him when he goes a step too far. Those who defended Trump \u8212\'20\'14 or were silent \u8212\'20\'14 need to demonstrate they get this. A contender like Perry, who called out Trump from the start \u8212\'20\'14 and now calls for him to get out of the race as unfit to be commander in chief \u8212\'20\'14 looks principled and a good judge of character (or lack thereof). Likewise, Jeb Bush \u8212\'20\'14 who called Trump out for racism \u8212\'20\'14 was well positioned to slam Trump again. (He tweeted yesterday, "Enough with the slanderous attacks. @SenJohnMcCain and all our veterans \u8212\'20\'14 particularly POWs have earned our respect and admiration.")\par \par \uc2 The Trump problem is acute for the non-Bush candidates, especially those who have been meek about calling him out. As we predicted, Trump is overshadowing all of them at the moment. "He seems to be taking support from the most conservative and anti-Washington rivals in the field, particularly \uc2 Mike Huckabee\uc2 , Scott Walker, Ted Cruz and Rand Paul," the Wall Street Journal reports. "Mr. Bush's rise in the polls, coming in tandem with Mr. Trump's growing strength, may be a sign that so-called establishment Republicans are closing ranks around Mr. Bush, possibly as a result of Mr. Trump consolidating his own support. \uc2 Marco Rubio\uc2  may be feeling some of that shift with his sinking numbers.\u160\'00\'A0The numbers suggest there may be very different approaches among the candidates to dealing with Mr. Trump, who has the media's attention right now."\par \par \uc2 Here is the dilemma on a debate stage, provided Trump is still in the race then. No candidate wants to further elevate Trump nor appear to be obsessed with fighting another contender when the target is obviously President Obama, Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party. The key is an effective counterpunch \u8212\'20\'14 or even a gesture.\par \par \uc2 One is reminded of the 2000 presidential debate in which Al Gore circled around George W. Bush, trying to intimidate him. Bush tersely nodded in his direction and kept going. An alternative style was demonstrated by Ronald Reagan in the New Hampshire debate in 1980:"I am paying for this microphone Mr. Green!" In both cases what was needed was presence of mind, confidence and an appreciation for the visual impact. What made Reagan effective was not simply his words, but his gesture in literally standing up to the offending party.\par \par \uc2 In the case of Trump, he may interrupt, say outrageous things, fling insults or directly challenge opponents. The object of his aggression has to be willing to respond without seeming peevish or defensive, but neither can he simply ignore the bait. One of the things voters are looking for is a sense of command. Who is going to stand up to Minority House Leader Nancy Pelosi or to the liberal attack dogs at a news\u160\'00\'A0conference? If a candidate can't handle a buffoon like Trump, he will be overwhelmed by far more sophisticated adversaries. So here's some unsolicited advice.\par \par \uc2 Don't let Trump interrupt you. Tell him to pipe down and wait his turn.\par \par \uc2 Don't let Trump trash your record or insult you. Tell him he doesn't know what he's talking about and then succinctly respond.\par \par \uc2 Don't let Trump say something racist or offensive about a group or individual. Put him in his place and tell him that sort of talk is not what America and the GOP are all about.\par \par \uc2 Don't let him appear serious. It is perfectly appropriate to laugh when he suggests sending Mexico a $100,000 tab for each \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . It is effective to make a joke at Trump's expense pointing out his billionaire cluelessness, his lack of experience in relevant areas or his obnoxious personality. (New Jersey Gov. \uc2 Chris Christie\uc2  was right to point out you cannot say "You're fired!" to Congress.)\par \par \uc2 Don't obsess about him. If he is just doing his "I'll make everyone rich!" routine, there is no reason to comment. Instead, if you have a record and have done things it is fine (irrespective of Trump) to observe that talk is cheap and you can't fake action or results.\par \par \uc2 Don't leave yourself open to attack by making excuses. Don't complain about being thwarted by Democrats in Congress or facing economic headwinds if you are a governor. Trump is likely to pounce and say he never lets anyone or anything get in his way.\par \par \uc2 Trump is a sideshow, but is also a test for other contenders. He was a test of character, which some but certainly not all candidates passed with flying colors. In a debate the challenge will about defending themselves against heckling, lies and insults.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020150719eb7j0030e\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

What does that mean? \b0\par\par\uc2 By Greg Sargent   \par \uc2 1,176 \uc2 words\par \uc2 17 July 2015\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2015, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Does the \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  boomlet reflect widespread agreement among Republican voters with his views on immigration in their rawest, ugliest form? Or does it reflect something else that no one has been able to put a finger on yet?\par \par \uc2 At first glance, a new Fox News poll would seem to suggest the former:\par \par \uc2 Recently, presidential candidate \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  called for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. He said Mexico is quote, "sending people that have lots of problems\u8230\'20\'26they're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people." Setting aside how Trump worded his comments, do you think he's basically right on this or not?\par \par \uc2 Seventy percent of Republicans said Yes, versus only 27 percent who said No. Americans overall said Trump is wrong by 53-44; independents said the same by 61-36.\par \par \uc2 As I've argued, the GOP's problem with Latino voters goes a lot deeper than Trump's rhetoric. That problem is rooted in the fundamental underlying difference between the two parties' views on immigration. Most Democrats believe the 11 million undocumented immigrants in this country have something positive to contribute, while most Republican lawmakers either don't believe that or cannot accept legalization under any circumstances, because it would reward lawbreaking.\par \par \uc2 The new Fox finding perhaps comports generally with that. But this shouldn't be taken too far. Other numbers from the Fox poll cast doubt on the idea that GOP voters are in the grip of unrelenting xenophobia. Large chunks of Republican voters agree that legal immigrants bring some positives to the country, such as new ideas and entrepreneurial spirit. This is in line with the view expressed by some GOP pollsters that Republican primary voters can be won over on immigration: their initial instinct is to lash out at the idea of legalization but they change their views when they are led through the moral and practical complexities of the problem. I like to think this is true. Indeed, I believe the instinct of many conservatives against rewarding lawbreaking should be engaged seriously, even if I disagree with it.\par \par \uc2 Still, how to explain the Trump boomlet? One GOP operative suggests an explanation for what's motivating Trump's supporters. "They seem to be galvanized by a notion that Washington is hopelessly corrupt \u8212\'20\'14 and you need somebody who is completely outside of the process to go in there and shake things up," this operative says. "For a lot of these folks, I think immigration speaks more broadly to a federal government that's not doing its job as effectively as they think it should be or could be."\par \par \uc2 Perhaps. Alternatively, it could just be name-recognition, or something else still. As it happens, there is one way this question might be settled. Many Republicans expect an epic showdown between Trump and Jeb Bush on immigration, perhaps at the coming GOP debate. It's possible that Jeb, who has challenged Republicans to accept that the 11 million are more than mere criminals, may try to call out Trump's views for what they are before a high profile audience. If so, the reaction from GOP voters across the country will tell us a lot.\par \par \uc2 ***********************************************************************\par \par \uc2 * AIPAC GEARS UP TO BLOCK IRAN DEAL: Ron Kampeas reports that the \uc2 American Israel Public Affairs Committee\uc2  is ramping up an aggressive campaign to lobby members of Congress to oppose the Iran deal. Their first-line targets:\par \par \uc2 Caught in the middle are the 28 Jewish lawmakers in the \uc2 U.S. House of Representatives\uc2  and the Senate. Jewish lawmakers usually are AIPAC's first avenue of access when they take on a major initiative. Yet the lawmakers, all but one of whom caucus with Democrats, also have been under pressure by the administration to back the deal.\par \par \uc2 As I've reported, progressive groups are also gearing up a multi-million-dollar pro-deal campaign. The White House only needs to hold one-third of one chamber.\par \par \uc2 * WHITE HOUSE PUSHES DEMS ON IRAN: Paul Kane has an interesting look at the lobbying effort the White House has mounted to persuade Dems not to abandon the Iran deal. Note this, about \uc2 Joe Biden\uc2 's role:\par \par \uc2 His ties to the Senate are legendary, but his connection to House Democrats is possibly even stronger. Over the last seven years Biden has tended to dozens of fundraisers for rank-and-file Democrats and made campaign stops in their districts\u8230\'20\'26.Of the 188 House Democrats, [Nancy] Pelosi will need to persuade about 145 of them to vote with the president on the Iran deal.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 And 150 House Dems have signed a letter supporting diplomacy, which suggests the votes may already be there in the lower chamber to sustain Obama's veto of a GOP disapproval measure.\par \par \uc2 * HILLARY ROLLS OUT 'PROFIT SHARING' MEASURE: Clinton fills in her economic agenda, proposing a measure to encourage corporations to share profits with workers:\par \par \uc2 The "rising incomes, sharing profits" tax credit Mrs. Clinton is proposing would give companies a two-year tax credit equivalent to 15 percent of profits distributed to employees, to be capped at 10 percent of wages. The credits would cost an estimated $10 billion to $20 billion over 10 years and would be paid for by closing corporate tax loopholes.\par \par \uc2 This is one of a number of Dem-aligned proposals to influence corporate behavior (another is reform of taxation of executive compensation) to combat stagnating wages and soaring inequality.\par \par \uc2 \u160\'00\'A0* WHAT'S REALLY DRIVING HILLARY'S ECONOMIC AGENDA: Paul Krugman argues that Clinton's economic speech this week reflects an "intellectual revolution" among economists who have learned that government intervention in the economy does not necessarily cause the individual hand of the market to smite down jobs.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, all indications are that the GOP candidates remain wedded to the dogma that the way to combat stagnating wages, opportunity and mobility is to get government out of the way. Behold the contours of the great 2016 argument over the economy taking shape.\par \par \uc2 * AND COULD TRUMP'S DREAMS OF A MEXICAN WALL BE REALIZED? Jerry Markon talks to experts and discovers that walling off illegal immigration from Mexico, as Trump has vowed to do, might not be that easy:\par \par \uc2 Any wall-building effort would encounter\u8230\'20\'26some of the same difficulties that bedeviled the federal government as it spent more than $7 billion to build fencing that now extends along one-third of the border. The obstacles include environmental and engineering problems; fights with ranchers and others who don't want to give up their land; and the huge topographical challenges of the border, which runs through remote desert in Arizona to rugged mountains in New Mexico and, for two-thirds of its length, along rivers.\par \par \uc2 Wait, so policy problems are often complicated? Trump's vow to charge Mexico $25,000 to $100,000 (the rate varies, apparently) per \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  might also prove hard to pull off.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020150717eb7h0043d\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 the-fix\par {\*\bkmkstart toc61}{\*\bkmkend toc61}\b \uc2 What the world thinks about our infatuation with \uc2 Donald Trump\b0\par\par\uc2 By Amber Phillips   \par \uc2 1,146 \uc2 words\par \uc2 17 July 2015\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2015, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 He's a "whack job" who "prattles on" with "his crazed ump of candyfloss hair" running his attention-seeking, "noxious presidential campaign."\par \par \uc2 That's how the international media sees \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 , who is surging in polls for the Republican nomination for president stateside. They are, to put a fine point on it, stumped about the whole thing.\par \par \uc2 [\uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  is now essentially guaranteed a spot on the debate stage]\par \par \uc2 But, the world media is just as interested in Trump as we are: A web search of English-language world media since Trump announced his candidacy June 16 found him talked about almost twice as much as front runners Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton.\par \par \uc2 Stories about NBC dropping Trump's show "The Apprentice" after a nationwide furor over Trump calling Mexican immigrants rapists ran in newspapers from Singapore to Northern Ireland.\par \par \uc2 We decided to look through news articles abroad to see what the world thinks about our current, perplexing love affair with Trump. What we found wasn't pretty.\par \par \uc2 The headline in The Daily Mail in the United Kingdom on the day of Trump's June 16 blustering announcement read: "Trump: "I'm rich \u8230\'20\'26 so make me president."\par \par \uc2 John Niven in \uc2 Scottish Daily Record & Sunday Mail\uc2  wrote soon after Trump announced that the whole thing was hard to believe, drawing a metaphor from news Trump hired actors to cheer him on at his campaign launch:\par \par \uc2 Ironically, this is exactly what America would become if Trump was to become president - a cast of extras following a lunatic around.\par \par \uc2 The Australian published a letter on June 18 declaring:\par \par \uc2 Reality TV star and real estate mogul \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  has two things going for his ludicrous push to spend his 70s in the White House - a bottomless war chest and endless self-delusion. His evidence for billing himself as the "most successful person ever to run for the presidency, by far" was his ownership of a "Gucci store that's worth more than Romney". His qualifications to lead the world's greatest democracy are threadbare. The Republicans will want to get the Trump sideshow out of the way as early as possible. The first primaries are not due for another nine months and until then, if he perseveres, Mr Trump will be a distraction from the serious contest of ideas the party and the US need.\par \par \uc2 Nick O'Malley, a Washington-based writer for Australian newspapers, including the Canberra Times, followed Trump on the campaign trail and wired this report back home to his readers:\par \par \uc2 Trump announced his campaign last month with one of his typical rambling unscripted speeches, full of bluster about his own wealth and genius and the perfidy of foreigners, mainly the Chinese and Mexicans, with many of the latter labelled as rapists. The speech blew a hole in his business interests, with restauranteurs abandoning one of his key developments and broadcasters like Univision and NBC cutting ties with him. Even \uc2 NASCAR\uc2  wanted no more of him.\u160\'00\'A0But a disgruntled strain of conservative white voter - the sort that has been bewildered throughout the Obama presidency and preened to calls to "take our country back" - loved him for that speech.\par \par \uc2 And for The Age in Melbourne, Australia, O'Malley wrote this after Trump released his personal finance disclosures:\par \par \uc2 Any lingering hopes the Republican establishment might have had that \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  would fade quietly from view were obliterated on Wednesday when new polls revealed a surge in his support, and his campaign team issued a press release confirming he had filed a financial disclosure.\par \par \uc2 Actually,\u160\'00\'A0Australian newspapers had a lot\u160\'00\'A0to say about Trump. John Kehoe, a Washington correspondent for The Australian Financial Review, filed this to his readers July 13:\par \par \uc2 The casino magnate has become a walking, talking circus for an entertainment-starved political media.\par \par \uc2 He added:\par \par \uc2 He will be hard to shut up. All this spells trouble for a \uc2 Republican Party\uc2  trying to rebuild its image and broaden its appeal against the Hillary juggernaut.\par \par \uc2 Simon Barber in South Africa's Business Day used Trump's launch as a stepping stone to criticize Texas Sen. Ted Cruz on July 16:\par \par \uc2 If the whack job \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  can top the opinion polls for the Republican nomination, as he was this week, chances are there's a wave of populist Republican id rolling in for Cruz to catch as well, once Trump has had his moment.\par \par \uc2 [Our \u160\'00\'A0Philip Bump agreed: Why Ted Cruz is defending \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 ]\par \par \uc2 Readers of the London Evening Standard got this story in their world section after Trump's July 11\u160\'00\'A0visit to Phoenix, declaring "Trump's New World Border":\par \par \uc2 \u160\'00\'A0\uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  has won over US Republican voters with speeches to the party faithful, attacking the government of Mexico and outlining a plan to charge them $100,000 for every \uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2  who crosses the border.\par \par \uc2 And Thailand's The Nation\u160\'00\'A0published this syndicated column from Jim Armitage of The Independent and London Evening Standard group of newspapers, that said:\par \par \uc2 Few things are more frightening than the thought of \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  being president of the US.\par \par \uc2 The German Press Agency carried Trump's presidential announcement in papers around the globe, including Thailand's The Nation, as: "Unapologetic and unabashed, Trump stumps to 'save USA'"\par \par \uc2 Of the 15 Republicans running for US president, the spotlight is currently shining brightest on a loud-mouthed billionaire with household name recognition who has never before sought public office.\par \par \uc2 On Thursday, Dave Hannigan of The Irish Times visited one of Trump's golf courses outside New York City, writing in the paper's sports page that "Noxious political campaign polluting Trump's ambitions for shiny new golf course:"\par \par \uc2 At various junctures around this critically acclaimed Jack Nicklaus design, green pipes and rotating vents periodically discharge methane gas from deep beneath the fairways, a legacy from the venue's previous life as a landfill.\par \par \uc2 Readers of the English-language Korea Times were treated to a June 18 syndicated column from the Tribune News Service, saying this:\par \par \uc2 But say this for \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 : He is a brilliant salesman. It is a useful talent to have in politics. The man himself may have had his share of financial and professional challenges, but the Trump name endures as a distinctively American brand of gaudy luxury.\par \par \uc2 And our friends up north couldn't resist declaring "The joker is Trump" in a July 11 editorial in Canada's Financial Post:\par \par \uc2 How does one explain presidential hopeful \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 's surge to first place in a new GOP primary poll? It is a threat the GOP must take seriously. With his money and his bluster, Trump could potentially do what Texas billionaire \uc2 Ross Perot\uc2  did as an independent candidate in 1992: take millions of Republic votes, and tip the election to the Democrats.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020150717eb7h006va\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved   \par \par \uc2 DOVER, N.H. - Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton spent 15 minutes here Thursday calmly unveiling a corporate profit-sharing plan as part of her proposal to grow middle-class incomes and rein in the power of Wall Street banks.\par \par \uc2 Later in the afternoon, about an hour's drive up State Highway 11, \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  held a rowdy campaign rally where he lashed out at opponents in both parties and stressed his controversial immigration positions. There were no concrete policy ideas.\par \par \uc2 The contrast highlighted a development that thrills Democratic operatives even as it unsettles their Republican counterparts: Trump, long seen as a political sideshow, is surging in the polls - offering Clinton a plum chance to boost her preferred image as a serious, seasoned alternative to a chaotic field of Republican presidential hopefuls now headlined by the brash billionaire.\par \par \uc2 "The juxtaposition of the two - your head may explode," said \uc2 Kathy Sullivan\uc2 , a former New Hampshire Democratic Party chair, who is backing Clinton.\par \par \uc2 Holding her first town hall meeting of the campaign, Clinton made a detailed pitch for her plan to spur more companies to share their profits with employees by offering a two-year tax credit as an incentive. The credit would be equal to at least 15 percent of profit-sharing distributions and the profit sharing would be capped at 10 percent on top of current employee wages.\par \par \uc2 "Everybody running on the other side has a different economic philosophy," Clinton said at the town hall, which came the same week she gave a speech laying out her economic message. "They really still believe if you cut taxes on the wealthy, if you lift regulations on corporations, that somehow economic activity will trickle down to all the rest of us."\par \par \uc2 Trump's explosion onto the Republican campaign has complicated the Republican effort to counterpunch. It's hard to get people to focus on middle-class pocketbook issues when the headline-grabbing mogul is on the trail boasting of his vast wealth, offending neighboring nations and tangling with critics in both parties.\par \par \uc2 In a sweltering room in Laconia, Trump took swipes at a laundry list of foes, from Clinton and President Obama to GOP rival Jeb Bush, as supporters cheered him on. He stood by his recent remarks that illegal immigrants from Mexico are "rapists" who are bringing "drugs" and "crime" into the country.\par \par \uc2 "It turns out I was right," Trump said, citing an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who allegedly killed a woman in California, and a Mexican drug kingpin who escaped from prison.\par \par \uc2 Later in his remarks, Trump summed up his candidacy: "The American dream is dead, but I'm going to make it bigger and better and stronger than ever before."\par \par \uc2 While Trump's Republican primary opponents were initially slow to criticize him, some have recently become more forceful.\par \par \uc2 "I have a message for my fellow Republicans and the independents who will be voting in the primary process: What Mr. Trump is offering is not conservatism, it is Trump-ism - a toxic mix of demagoguery and nonsense," said former Texas governor Rick Perry (R) in a Thursday statement.\par \par \uc2 Still, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), who huddled with Trump on Wednesday, has praised his blunt tone. Other presidential contenders have shown reluctance to openly bash him.\par \par \uc2 "\uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  can speak for himself, and I'm not going to put words in the mouth of any candidate, him or anybody else out there," said Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R), who also campaigned in New Hampshire on Thursday.\par \par \uc2 Trump, who has flirted with running for president in past elections, is diving deeper into the race with each passing day. He has launched a full-fledged campaign, hired early state staff and on Wednesday said he had filed a financial disclosure with the \uc2 Federal Election Commission\uc2 , though he did not release a copy of that disclosure.\par \par \uc2 National polls show him to be a top-tier candidate. But many Republicans remain unconvinced he is committed for the long haul.\par \par \uc2 "I don't think he is looking at all like a serious candidate," said former New Hampshire Republican Party chairman Fergus Cullen. "There are some trappings of a serious campaign, but this is a Potemkin effort at best."\par \par \uc2 His effort may not be built for the long haul - his campaign's burn rate, a comparison of money raised with money spent, was an astounding 74 percent, highest in the Republican field. But some Republicans worry that even a primary-season Trump candidacy may cost them next year, as a new Univision News Poll shows that 70 percent of Hispanic voters say they have an unfavorable impression of him.\par \par \uc2 The Clinton-Trump roadshow isn't over yet: Trump is the feature speaker at a Republican dinner on Friday in Arkansas, where Clinton - whose husband, \uc2 Bill Clinton\uc2 , was the state's governor - will speak Saturday at a Democratic dinner.\par \par \uc2 Jose DelReal contributed to this report. \par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com\par \par \uc2 WP20150717clintontrump0717\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020150717eb7h00026\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 DOVER, N.H. \u8212\'20\'14 Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton spent 15 minutes here Thursday calmly unveiling a corporate profit-sharing plan as part of her proposal to grow middle class incomes and rein in the power of Wall Street banks.\par \par \uc2 Later in the afternoon, about an hour's drive up State Highway\u160\'00\'A011, \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  held a rowdy campaign rally where he lashed out at opponents in both parties and stressed his controversial immigration positions. There were no concrete policy ideas.\par \par \uc2 The contrast highlighted a development that thrills Democratic operatives even as it unsettles their Republican counterparts: Trump, long seen as a political sideshow, is surging in the polls \u8212\'20\'14 offering Clinton a plum chance to boost her preferred image as a serious, seasoned alternative to a chaotic field of Republican presidential hopefuls now headlined by the brash billionaire.\par \par \uc2 "The juxtaposition of the two \u8212\'20\'14 your head may explode," said \uc2 Kathy Sullivan\uc2 , a former New Hampshire Democratic Party chair, who is backing Clinton.\par \par \uc2 Holding her first town hall meeting of the campaign, Clinton made a detailed pitch for her plan to spur more companies to share their profits with employees by offering a two-year tax credit as an incentive. The credit would be equal to at least 15 percent of profit sharing distributions and the profit sharing would be capped at 10 percent on top of current employee wages.\par \par \uc2 "Everybody running on the other side has a different economic philosophy," Clinton said at the town hall, which came the same week she gave a speech laying out her economic message. "They really still believe if you cut taxes on the wealthy, if you lift regulations on corporations, that somehow economic activity will trickle down to all the rest of us."\par \par \uc2 Trump's explosion onto the Republican campaign has complicated the Republican effort to counterpunch. It's hard to get people to focus on middle class pocketbook issues when the \u173\'00\'ADheadline-grabbing mogul is on the trail boasting of his vast wealth, offending neighboring nations and tangling with critics in both parties.\par \par \uc2 In a sweltering room in Laconia, Trump took swipes at a laundry list of foes, from Clinton and President Obama to GOP rival Jeb Bush, as supporters cheered him on. He stood by his recent remarks that illegal immigrants from Mexico are "rapists" who are bringing "drugs" and "crime" into the country.\par \par \uc2 "It turns out I was right," Trump said, citing an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who allegedly killed a woman in California, and a Mexican drug kingpin who escaped from prison.\par \par \uc2 Later in his remarks, Trump summed up his candidacy: "The American dream is dead, but I'm going to make it bigger and better and stronger than ever before."\par \par \uc2 While Trump's Republican primary opponents were initially slow to critique him, some have recently become more forceful.\par \par \uc2 "I have a message for my fellow Republicans and the independents who will be voting in the primary process: what Mr. Trump is offering is not conservatism, it is Trump-ism \u8211\'20\'13 a toxic mix of demagoguery and nonsense," said former Texas governor Rick Perry (R) in a Thursday statement.\par \par \uc2 Still, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), who huddled with Trump on Wednesday, has praised his blunt tone. Other presidential contenders have shown reluctance to openly bash him.\par \par \uc2 "\uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  can speak for himself, and I'm not going to put words in the mouth of any candidate, him or anybody else out there," said Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R), who also campaigned in New Hampshire on Thursday.\par \par \uc2 Trump, who has flirted with running for president in past elections, is diving deeper into the race with each passing day. He has launched an full-fledged campaign, hired early state staff and on Wednesday said he filed a financial disclosure with the \uc2 Federal Election Commission\uc2 , though he did not release a copy of that disclosure.\par \par \uc2 National polls show him to be a top-tier candidate. But many Republicans remain unconvinced he is committed for the long haul.\par \par \uc2 "I don't think he is looking at all like serious candidate," said former New Hampshire Republican Party chairman Fergus Cullen. "There are some trappings of a serious campaign, but this is a Potemkin effort at best."\par \par \uc2 His effort may not be built for the long haul \u8212\'20\'14 his campaign's burn rate, a comparison of money raised with money spent, was an astounding 74 percent, highest in the Republican field. But some Republicans worry that even a primary season Trump candidacy may cost them next year, as a new Univision News Poll shows that 70\u160\'00\'A0percent of Hispanic voters say they have an unfavorable impression of him.\par \par \uc2 The Clinton-Trump roadshow isn't over yet: Trump is the feature speaker at a Republican dinner on Friday in Arkansas, where Clinton \u8212\'20\'14 whose husband, \uc2 Bill Clinton\uc2 , was the state's governor \u8212\'20\'14 will speak Saturday at a Democratic dinner.\par \par \uc2 sean.sullivan@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 Jose DelReal contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020150717eb7h000jh\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

Really? ; Senate majority leader made a comment on Fox News Sunday, but it didn't have to do with 'Kate's Law.'\b0\par\par\uc2 By Erik Wemple   \par \uc2 453 \uc2 words\par \uc2 16 July 2015\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2015, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Bill O'Reilly has seeded a compelling conflict of interest on his eponymous Fox News program. This month, he began advocating something now known as "Kate's Law," a proposal to slap a "mandatory" five-year prison sentence on undocumented immigrants who are deported and "return to the United States." A petition on BillOReilly.com is seeking signatures for the effort.\par \par \uc2 The idea is noble \u8212\'20\'14 to guard against a repeat of the San Francisco tragedy in which an undocumented and oft-deported immigrant \u8212\'20\'14 Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez \u8212\'20\'14 is alleged to have killed 32-year-old Kate Steinle. As the force behind "Kate's Law," O'Reilly promotes the proposal on air; as a Fox News host, he reports on the proposal's progress on Capitol Hill.\par \par \uc2 On the latter front, O'Reilly has struck an optimistic tone. Just last night, he ticked off the names of six Republican presidential candidates who are backing the initiative: Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.), Sen. Lindsey Graham (S.C.), former Texas governor Rick Perry, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, Dr. Ben Carson and \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 . And on Tuesday night, O'Reilly ticked off an even more important backer: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who in O'Reilly's words has "indicated he will get behind Kate's Law."\par \par \uc2 Oh yeah?\par \par \uc2 The Erik Wemple Blog asked McConnell's office about his stance on the proposal. A spokesman replied by turning our attention to a comment that McConnell had made on the July 12 edition of "Fox News Sunday":\par \par \uc2 BRET BAIER: A couple more things. In the wake of all the attention of sanctuary cities, after this murder of 32-year-old Kate Steinle in San Francisco, authorities say, at the hands of an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , five-time deportee \u8212\'20\'14 will Congress move on sanctuary city legislation?\par \par \uc2 That response, of course, doesn't address criminal sanctions against deportees who attempt to re-enter the United States. So we asked McConnell & Co. whether the leader said anything specific about "Kate's Law." "He wasn't asked about that," responded the spokesman, Don Stewart. When we asked point-blank whether McConnell had given an indication of his endorsement of O'Reilly's proposal, Stewart replied, "As I noted, we only have the one quote below which I sent to you. He spoke about denying federal law enforcement funding to municipalities that refuse to follow federal law."\par \par \uc2 We sought comment from O'Reilly on the substantiation for his McConnell claim. No comment.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020150716eb7g008eu\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 In recent weeks, there has been an upsurge in controversy over crime committed by immigrants, sparked by a recent murder in San Francisco, and by presidential candidate \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 's exploitation of the issue. But as conservative commentator Linda Chavez points out, immigrants \u8212\'20\'14 both legal and illegal \u8212\'20\'14 have far lower crime rates than native-born Americans do. Even if they did not, it does not follow that immigration restrictions and deportation are the right solution to the problem.\par \par \uc2 Numerous studies show that immigrants have lower crime rates than natives, a finding which holds true even if you focus solely on Mexican immigrants \u8212\'20\'14 the main objects of Trump's ire. Indeed, Mexican-born immigrant males aged 18-39 who lack a high school diploma actually had a lower incarceration rate in 2010 (2.8%) than all native-born males of the same age group (3.3%), regardless of education level (the incarceration rate for native-born men without a high school diploma was 10.7% in the same year). Overall, immigrants are only about one-fifth as likely to be incarcerated for crimes, and the difference is mostly due to a lower propensity to commit crime in the immigrant population rather than to deportation or other law enforcement measures that differentially target immigrants.\par \par \uc2 For these reasons, claims that we could lower violent crime rates by reducing immigration or deporting more illegals are fundamentally misplaced. Indeed, if reducing violent crime is really the goal, we could shift some of the vast resources currently devoted to keeping out and deporting peaceful migrants and reinvest them in combating violent crime and terrorism.\par \par \uc2 But let's assume that the data showed that immigrants have an unusually high crime after all. It still would not follow that increased immigration restrictions and deportation are the answer. Even if immigrants had a crime rate, say, twice as high, as those of natives, immigration restrictions and deportation efforts would still punish vastly more innocent, nonviolent people, than violent criminals. Within the native-born population, there are a number of demographic groups that have much higher than average crime rates. For example, a hugely disproportionate percentage of violent crimes are committed by young males, particularly homicides. Other things equal, increasing the proportion of young males in any population is likely to disproportionately increase the crime rate. Yet few would argue that this justifies restricting the movement of young males as a class, or otherwise imposing constraints on their liberty. Indeed, few Americans would support imposing a curfew that applied to young males alone, even if might reduce the crime rate. Similarly, few would support a differential drinking age for men, as opposed to women, even though inebriated men are far more likely to resort to violence than women are. We recognize that it is wrong to restrict the liberty of large classes of innocent people merely because they happen to belong to a demographic group with a relatively high crime rate. For their part, most conservative immigration restrictionists rightly recognize that it is wrong to deprive innocent gun-owners of their right to possess handguns merely because a small minority use them to commit crimes.\par \par \uc2 The same principle applies to immigrants as much as it does to young males and gun owners. Indeed, it does so with much greater force. Those who wish to crack down on immigrants generally in order to lower the crime rate advocate far more draconian measures than a differential curfew or drinking age. They favor imposing immigration restrictions and deportation rules that consign huge numbers of people (most of whom have not harmed anyone at all) to a lifetime of Third World poverty and oppression.\par \par \uc2 Given the enormity of the harms and restrictions on freedom involved, they can be justified \u8212\'20\'14 if at all \u8212\'20\'14 only if they are the only way to prevent a comparably grave evil. The burden of proof that such policies must meet is a lot higher than whatever might be sufficient to justify a differential curfew, confiscation of guns, or similar more moderate infringement on freedom. Yet it is fairly obvious that there are numerous more cost-effective ways to lower violent crime, including \u8212\'20\'14 as noted above \u8212\'20\'14 devoting to that purpose some of the resources currently allocated to keeping out and deporting peaceful migrants. For example, some of that money could be spent on increasing the number of police officers assigned to high-crime neighborhoods. Unlikely immigration restrictions, increasing police presence has a proven record of reducing crime rates.\par \par \uc2 Many immigration restrictionists nonetheless claim that immigrants \u8212\'20\'14 or at least illegal immigrants \u8212\'20\'14 are different from young males because their mere presence in the US violates the law, thus essentially making them criminals regardless of whether they have committed any other wrongs. Illegally crossing the border is in fact a minor misdemeanor under federal law. If you think that anyone who violates the law in any way is thereby a morally depraved person who must be punished, then you can consistently advocate immigration restriction and deportation as "solutions" to immigrant criminality.\par \par \uc2 But most Americans do not in fact seem to believe that all violations of law are morally wrong and deserve punishment. If you drove your car to work today, you probably exceeded the speed limit, which is also a violation of criminal law. Yet you probably don't think you did anything wrong, much less deserve punishment. Almost every business violates at least a few of the manifold state and federal regulations that apply to them. Overall, the vast majority of American adults have violated state or federal criminal law at one point or another.\par \par \uc2 The point is not just that most Americans violate the law, but that we believe we are morally justified in doing so in many situations. And, in most such cases, our reasons are far less compelling than those of border-crossing illegal immigrants, whose only other option is to accept a lifetime of poverty and misery living under corrupt and often oppressive Third World governments. The average \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  is far less morally blameworthy than the average American who decides to drive a few miles above the speed limit in order to get to work faster, or to engage in underage drinking \u8212\'20\'14 both of which activities are more likely to endanger innocent third parties than merely crossing a border in search of freedom and opportunity.\par \par \uc2 The desire to prevent violent crime is laudable regardless of whether the perpetrators are immigrants or natives. But we should find ways to deter and punish the guilty without harming large numbers of innocent people in the process.\par \par \uc2 UPDATE: Immigration policy expert Alex Nowrasteh of the \uc2 Cato Institute\uc2  has a more detailed look at the data on immigration and crime. As he points out, studies using different methodologies have all generally reached the same conclusion: "that immigrants are less crime-prone than natives with some small potential exceptions."\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020150715eb7f000m9\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 erik-wemple\par {\*\bkmkstart toc66}{\*\bkmkend toc66}\b \uc2 CNN\uc2 's Chris Cuomo responds to fierce critics at Fox News, Breitbart ; Commentators attack with "impunity," says \uc2 CNN\uc2  host.\b0\par\par\uc2 By Erik Wemple   \par \uc2 1,032 \uc2 words\par \uc2 15 July 2015\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2015, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 In an interview earlier this week on \uc2 CNN\uc2 's morning program "New Day," co-host Chris Cuomo discussed a number of topics with \uc2 Trump Organization\uc2  executive vice president \uc2 Michael Cohen\uc2  \u8212\'20\'14 Mexico, apologies, the media, for instance. An exchange over so-called "sanctuary cities," however, animated Cuomo's critics.\par \par \uc2 In crediting his boss, \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 , for starting a debate about immigration, Cohen noted that he'd raised awareness on this topic:\par \par \uc2 COHEN: These sanctuaries on the border that allow illegals to stay and if, in fact, they end up getting caught, they cannot be forced \u8230\'20\'26 CHRIS CUOMO, \uc2 CNN\uc2  HOST: You are talking about sanctuary cities that exist all over the country? COHEN: That's correct. CUOMO: That's a misnomer. Those are cities that are in dispute with ICE about how you deal with people that they're holding. COHEN: They are part of the United States you can't be in dispute with the federal government. CUOMO: But they're not safe havens, the way you are describing. COHEN: They most certainly are safe havens.\par \par \uc2 Breitbart's John Nolte responded with nouns: "Cuomo is both a liar and a charlatan," wrote Nolte. Fox News's Bill O'Reilly last night responded with requests: "He should certainly rethink his sympathies." And this morning "Fox & Friends" co-host Steve Doocy responded with mockeries: "If you want a real news channel, you turn over to \uc2 CNN\uc2  \u8212\'20\'14 the Cuomo News Network\u8230\'20\'26" After playing the chat between Cuomo and Cohen, Doocy circled back to the theme: "So that's what you get on the real news channel, over there." Context for the controversy, of course, comes from the killing of Kate Steinle in San Francisco, allegedly at the hands of an undocumented immigrant \u8212\'20\'14 Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez \u8212\'20\'14 who was released from custody in San Francisco. Federal authorities were prepared to deport Lopez-Sanchez but didn't receive a heads-up from San Francisco, which has a sanctuary ordinance regulating cooperation with immigration officials.\par \par \uc2 On this morning's edition of "New Day," Cuomo responded to the criticism, not with a \uc2 Facebook\uc2  post or a tweet, but with an interview. John Torres, a former acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), told Cuomo this about the evolution of the so-called "sanctuary cities": "Well, some of the local jurisdictions wanted people with no status to come forward to be able to report crimes," he said. "And, so, that's understandable if you have someone who's afraid to report a domestic violence crime, for example, or someone who's afraid to report a murder even because they have no status. There's a fear in the community that they're going to be turned over for deportation. So that's really how\u160\'00\'A0\u8212\'20\'14\u160\'00\'A0how they started." Though Cuomo was coding the interview to answer his critics, Torres did agree that undocumented immigrants aren't beyond the reach of deportation in these localities:\par \par \uc2 CUOMO: The critics really came up with the moniker of sanctuary city. Do you think that is a fair definition, meaning that any undocumented or \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  in a sanctuary city doesn't have to fear any type of detection, any type of law action against them?\par \par \uc2 In concluding the segment, Cuomo verily looked O'Reilly, Nolte, et al. in the eyes: "All right. I appreciate this, Mr. Torres, because you did the job and you say you have mixed feelings about sanctuary cities, but it's complex. And too many on the partisan sides of politics want to make it simple for their own purposes."\par \par \uc2 In an interview with the Erik Wemple Blog, Cuomo said of Breitbart: "I don't know what that outlet has become, but you know how the business is: The meaner it is, the higher the form of flattery. \u8230\'20\'26 If you can't argue the facts, you attack." And of O'Reilly: "I think that Bill O'Reilly is a pretty known quantity who speaks his mind and then people decide whether they like it or not."\par \par \uc2 A very complicating consideration for Cuomo is the testimony of Lopez-Sanchez himself, who has said "he knew San Francisco was a sanctuary city where he would not be pursued by immigration officials," according to a jailhouse interview. Isn't the accused a good authority on this matter? Not particularly, says Cuomo: "Citing the killer as a source on whether or not sanctuary cities are safe havens is a little curious. I would prefer to hear from an acting former director of ICE about what sanctuary cities represent."\par \par \uc2 Based on how Fox News, Breitbart and certain other outlets frame the issue, argues Cuomo, sanctuary cities are just "safe havens" that are "soft on immigration" \u8212\'20\'14 and upon those buzz-terms piles a whole mound of innuendo. "In the safe haven thing, the suggestion is that anything that an undocumented immigrant does is okay. There's a further implication that somehow Sanchez was empowered by San Francisco to become a murderer. That is the concern \u8212\'20\'14 the danger of generalizing and misrepresenting the situation. It sounds like this is license to kill for immigrants.\par \par \uc2 "To say that they're completely safe havens is a loaded statement that has a potential political motivation and is not entirely accurate. And that's why we do our job that way instead of causing confusion," says Cuomo, referring to "New Day's" decision to bring in a former ICE official to hash out the complexities of cities with sanctuary laws.\par \par \uc2 Another flurry of slam-blogging hit Cuomo back in May, when the journalist-cum-lawyer tweeted that "hate speech is excluded from [First Amendment] protection."

Alexander   \par \uc2 406 \uc2 words\par \uc2 14 July 2015\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2015, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 A D.C. Superior Court judge Tuesday ordered the man accused of the 2001 killing of Washington intern Chandra Levy to remain in jail until trial after the judge told attorneys there was "probable cause" that Ingmar Guandique committed first-degree murder in Levy's death.\par \par \uc2 In 2010, Guandique, 33, was convicted and sentenced to 60 years in prison for Levy's killing. But in June, after a two-year effort by Guandique's public defenders, a judge granted a retrial after his attorneys argued that a key witness who testified against him had lied.\par \par \uc2 Levy was a 24-year-old intern with the \uc2 Federal Bureau of Prisons\uc2  when she disappeared May 1, 2001. The case gained national attention because police investigators at first suspected \u8212\'20\'14 but then cleared \u8212\'20\'14 Gary A. Condit, a married California congressman who was 30 years her senior and with whom Levy was having an affair. Levy's remains were found a year later in Rock Creek Park.\par \par \uc2 Since his arrest in Levy's death, Guandique and his attorney maintained he was innocent. No eyewitness, forensic evidence or medical cause of death linked Guandique to Levy's death.\par \par \uc2 Three years after Guandique's trial, his attorneys petitioned the court saying that their client's conviction "was based on a lie" spun by a former cellmate, Armando Morales, who testified that Guandique confessed to killing Levy. Morales withheld his own previous cooperation with law enforcement as a prison informant.\par \par \uc2 At Tuesday's 90-minute hearing, prosecutors noted that aside from Morales's testimony, Guandique pleaded guilty to attacking two women at knifepoint in Rock Creek Park in 2002 and was sentenced to 10 years in prison.\par \par \uc2 Assistant U.S. Attorney Deborah Sines said those attacks, along with testimony that Guandique had scratches on his face at the time Levy disappeared, were evidence of his involvement in Levy's death. Prosecutors also said they were concerned that if Guandique was released, he might flee the jurisdiction because immigration officials had placed a detainer on him. Guandique is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from El Salvador.\par \par \uc2 Judge Robert E. Morin agreed with prosecutors, citing the "evidence of the other crimes and the unexplained injuries" on Guandique's face as enough reason to order him to remain in jail until his March trial.\par \par \uc2 keith.alexander@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020150714eb7e003uy\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

He's just following the sound of applause.\b0\par\par\uc2 By Philip Bump   \par \uc2 933 \uc2 words\par \uc2 13 July 2015\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2015, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Donald Trump is a virulent immigration hard-liner by accident.\par \par \uc2 Shortly before his presidential announcement speech, Trump's campaign sent out a packet of material for reporters with a press release, information about Trump's finances, and a copy of the "remarks" he would offer from the lobby of Trump Tower included. Marked "as delivered," the draft remarks mention Mexico mostly in passing, saying that Mexico "is not our friend. They are beating us at the border and hurting us badly at economic development." The introduction Trump planned to offer said only, "ISIS, China, Mexico are all beating us. Everybody is beating us. "\par \par \uc2 That's not the speech Trump delivered. Instead, he offered the sort of stream-of-consciousness rant that has become the hallmark of his still-young candidacy. While he was still warming up, he talked about ISIS and China in more detail, then offered his now-infamous description of Mexico. The country is "sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with [them]," he said. "They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists." Coming up for air, he added, "And some, I assume, are good people."\par \par \uc2 In part thanks to the fact that he kept rambling for another half hour, the comments about Mexicans didn't cause many ripples right off the bat. Nor did Trump immediately seize upon immigration as a campaign issue. The closest he came was a fight with \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  after she declared that his rhetoric on Mexicans was the sort of thing that could trigger someone to commit an act like the shooting in Charleston. Trump went after Clinton; he didn't talk about the urgency of illegal immigration. Beyond that exchange, the comments didn't come up at all. On \uc2 Twitter\uc2  -- which serves as a sort of transcription of Trump's brain -- he mostly complained about President Obama, retweeted praise, and got in a fight with Neil Young.\par \par \uc2 It wasn't until \uc2 Univision\uc2  spoke out about Trump's comments that said comments moved to the center of the conversation. And very quickly, Trump realized he had a winner.\par \par \uc2 To thousands of people, it didn't matter that Trump's initial scattershot defense of his comments was wrong, that illegal immigrants aren't more likely to commit crime than those here legally. Nor did it matter, it seems, that Trump eventually shifted his defense to imply that he'd meant that the Mexican government was sending criminals across the border. For an apparently substantial (or at least very vocal) part of the electorate, simply calling out illegal immigrants as bad in broad strokes was enough reason to rise to Trump's defense. Trump, whose reaction to praise is Pavlovian, instantly realized it.\par \par \uc2 Interestingly, the Republican establishment that's so eager to have Trump vanish bears some of the blame. After Mitt Romney's 2012 loss, leaders in the party recognized that they needed to figure out a way to either embrace or neutralize the Hispanic vote before 2016. There was a big strategy document and repeated attempts to figure out a "comprehensive immigration reform" package. A package passed the Senate only to be ignored in the House, where conservative opposition was much stronger. Last summer's immigration crisis -- and the media firestorm that greeted it -- compounded the problem, but the defeat of House Majority Leader \uc2 Eric Cantor\uc2  in Virginia's congressional primary stopped it cold. Cantor's defeat was trumpeted in the conservative media as being a reaction to his advocacy of immigration reform.\par \par \uc2 Whether or not that's why Cantor lost -- a strong argument can be made that it wasn't -- his defeat made clear the split within the party. There is an establishment that wants to figure out how to soften the party's position on immigration in hopes that it can entice Hispanic voters. And then there is a very loud and very frustrated part of the base that wants no such thing. Donald Trump 's random attack on "illegal immigration" had the same effect as George Clooney and the Soggy Bottom Boys singing "Man of Constant Sorrow" in "O Brother, Where Art Thou?" The crowd went wild, he had no idea why, but he jumped on top of the wave.\par \par \uc2 Trump is at least self-aware enough to realize it. In an admirably frank interview, our Robert Costa asked Trump why he decided to seize on immigration. Trump's response? "They gave it to me. It wasn't a big part of my announcement speech \u8212\'20\'14 a small paragraph."\par \par \uc2 Immigration is never really what Trump wanted to talk about. That may be one reason that his "solutions" to illegal immigration are so nonsensical: Build a giant wall (with Mexico somehow being enticed to foot the bill), and charging Mexico $100,000 per \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  (though Trump doesn't know how many illegal immigrants there are).\par \par \uc2 Or they may be nonsensical because Trump has never really thought seriously about how to fix this or any other political problem. Perhaps -- perhaps! -- he's just in it for the applause. Once that applause tapers off, it's hard to imagine Trump pursuing his candidacy with any real gusto -- unless he accidentally pushes another hot button and hears distant clapping. In which case, that's the direction he's likely to head.\par \par \uc2 Reince Priebus and the GOP have ten fingers and ten toes crossed that he doesn't.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020150713eb7d003s7\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

What about Fox News? \b0\par\par\uc2 By Erik Wemple   \par \uc2 698 \uc2 words\par \uc2 13 July 2015\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2015, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Keep an eye on Fox News's coverage of Donald Trump in the coming days.\par \par \uc2 Over the weekend, \uc2 Twitter\uc2  user \uc2 Rupert Murdoch\uc2  ripped him:\par \par \uc2 Mexican immigrants, as with all immigrants, have much lower crime rates than native born. Eg El Paso safest city in U.S. Trump wrong.\par \par \uc2 In addition to tweeting, \uc2 Rupert Murdoch\uc2  serves as \uc2 21st Century Fox\uc2 's executive co-chairman, in which capacity he supervises \u8212\'20\'14 along with his sons James and \uc2 Lachlan Murdoch\uc2  \u8212\'20\'14 Fox News chief \uc2 Roger Ailes\uc2 . Though it's unclear what prompted Murdoch's \uc2 Twitter\uc2  slap, one possibility is the tone of Trump coverage on Fox News itself. What tone? In an interview with NBC News last week, Trump defended himself against a few lines of attack by citing the favorable nods he'd received on the network. Asked by NBC News's Katy Tur whether he was hurting the \uc2 Republican Party\uc2 , Trump responded, "Well, on Fox, they say that I did a great service. Because I'm the one that brought up the whole discussion on immigration."\par \par \uc2 Sean Hannity, whose Fox News program has served as a clearinghouse for Republican presidential candidates, remarked on June 29, "I agree with Mr. Trump. As somebody who has been down to the border 11 times, I have seen the drug warehouses, I was there when criminals were arrested, I know the human trafficking side."\par \par \uc2 Contrast such sentiments with another of Murdoch's weekend tweets:\par \par \uc2 So \uc2 FBI\uc2  says 267000 illegal aliens incarcerated. Who are the other two million presently incarcerated? Seems like social breakdown.\par \par \uc2 It's unsurprising that Murdoch is staking out a softer stand on this issue than Fox News hard-liners; the Australian-born mogul, after all, is an immigrant himself, having become a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1985.\par \par \uc2 A more extreme position on immigration comes from Murdoch's longtime colleague and moneymaker, Ailes. "If I was president I'd do what's necessary, including putting Navy SEALs on the border with orders to shoot to kill drug dealers who are trying to infiltrate the country," Ailes told biographer Zev Chafets for the book "\uc2 Roger Ailes\uc2 : Off Camera." Ailes also told Chafets that "a lot of conservative views on immigration are reactionary."\par \par \uc2 Another biography of Ailes \u8212\'20\'14 "The Loudest Voice in the Room," by Gabriel Sherman \u8212\'20\'14 notes that a certain reckoning within the Fox hierarchy took place after the Republicans failed in their attempt to seize the White House in the 2012 election. "On issues like gun control and immigration, Murdoch was moving away from Ailes," writes Sherman. "The Loudest Voice in the Room" cites a far more extreme version of the Navy SEAL anecdote than does the Chafets book. "I would make it a requirement that you would have to personally kill an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  coming into the country," Ailes said, according to Sherman's book. "They would have to bring home a dead body."\par \par \uc2 Sherman's book cites a meeting* in which Ailes unloaded on a number of topics, including immigration:\par \par \uc2 Ailes said that if he were president, he would solve the immigration problem by sitting the president of Mexico down and giving him a stern talking-to: "Your country is corrupt. You can now only take thirty percent of what people earn instead of seventy percent. If you don't do that, I'll send the CIA down there to kill you."\par \par \uc2 Trump, meanwhile, has outlined a slightly different approach: "Every time Mexico \u8212\'20\'14 really intelligently \u8212\'20\'14 sends people over we charge Mexico $100,000 for every person they send over," said the candidate over the weekend.\par \par \uc2 So what are the chances that Murdoch's views on immigration will trickle down through Ailes and into Fox News? Who the heck knows. Ailes is in a grand position at Fox News, having won a recent battle over his place in the \uc2 21st Century Fox\uc2  hierarchy. Maybe it doesn't really matter, considering that this Trump-immigration mess is due to peter out in a day or two, God willing.\par \par \uc2 *Update: This meeting took place at the Ailes-owned Putnam County News & Recorder, according to Sherman's unauthorized biography.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020150713eb7d006k5\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SOMEWHERE ABOVE THE AMERICAN SOUTHWEST \u8212\'20\'14 It was Saturday night aboard \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 's gleaming \uc2 Boeing\uc2  757. An hour earlier, he had finished the most high-profile speech of his nearly month-old presidential campaign: a rally attended by thousands in Phoenix where he railed against illegal immigration and countless other targets \u8212\'20\'14 \uc2 Macy's\uc2 , NBC, \uc2 NASCAR\uc2 , U.S. Ambassador to Japan Caroline Kennedy \u8212\'20\'14 for 70 minutes. The billionaire real-estate mogul took off his jacket, clicked the oversized satellite television in his plush, cream-colored cabin over to Fox News and closely watched the channel's coverage.\par \par \uc2 As shadowy images of Hispanic immigrants and criminal mug shots were interspersed with his remarks, Trump, 69, turned gleeful. "The only reason they're talking about this is because of me," he said. "Look at that crowd, fantastic," he added. He sat down in his leather chair. His eponymous crest was woven into the headrest, and his plane was 30,000 feet above the border he had called so porous that illegal immigrants are able to "flow in like water."\par \par \uc2 In an expletive-laden interview over soft drinks \u8212\'20\'14 Trump sips from a small plastic bottle of \uc2 Coca-Cola\uc2  \u8212\'20\'14 the celebrity contender said he has no plans to change the way he's running for the Republican nomination, which combines his trademark showmanship, an outsider-populist credo that resists ideological categorization and incendiary comments that have thrilled conservative activists.\par \par \uc2 Trump was most animated when analyzing the way the news media\u160\'00\'A0covered him and dishing with aides about the articles they had printed out. He was less excited discussing the process of presidential politics. When asked about the coming debate, set for Aug. 6 in Cleveland, he shrugged and said, "Whatever." When asked about calls for him to tone down his fiery pitch, he shrugged again.\par \par \uc2 Following is a lightly edited transcript:\par \par \uc2 What's next?\par \par \uc2 More of the same, I'll keep doing my thing. I'll go around to different places, get great receptivity. I get the biggest crowds. I get the biggest standing ovations. You saw that today, I could have been there for 20 minutes and they would have been cheering. So, you'll see more of the same, getting the word out.\par \par \uc2 Will immigration remain your focus?\par \par \uc2 No. It's just one of the things. It's not only immigration. It's about trade. They go hand in hand. Immigration is one of the things you have to do. I'm also a moralist. You heard what I said today about health care. I said, I'm sorry, folks, but we have to take care people that don't have money. I know it's not the conservative thing to say, but I got a standing ovation \u8212\'20\'14 and these were very conservative people. We can't let people down when they can't get any medical care, when they're sick and don't have money to go to a doctor. You help them.\par \par \uc2 So Trump has a heart?\par \par \uc2 A big heart, let me tell you. Too big.\par \par \uc2 When did you decide to seize on immigration and make it the thrust of your campaign?\par \par \uc2 They gave it to me. It wasn't a big part of my announcement speech \u8212\'20\'14 a small paragraph. The Democrats and the enemies lined up and they criticized me for one line where I said Mexico is sending \u8212\'20\'14 I said Mexico is sending. I didn't say people are coming over and they're bad people. They would leave off the 'Mexico is sending' part, chop it and say I said 'rapists' when talking about people.\par \par \uc2 But when you use a word like rapist . . .\par \par \uc2 It is a very rough word. It's okay to use.\par \par \uc2 [Eyeing the television, Trump gets up to watch another Fox News segment about his Arizona gathering. "Jeanine Pirro, let's see what she has to say about me," he said as he settled into his couch. When a picture of the Mexican laborer accused of killing a San Francisco woman is put on screen, Trump said: "Look at that guy, look at what he did, killing that beautiful girl. [Expletive] animal." He returned several minutes later to continue the interview.]\par \par \uc2 [Read more: The 23 people and institutions Trump slammed in one speech]\par \par \uc2 Are you looking forward to the debate?\par \par \uc2 No, not one way or the other. Whatever. I don't look forward or not look forward. It is what it is.\par \par \uc2 When are you going to file your financial disclosure with the \uc2 Federal Election Commission\uc2 ?\par \par \uc2 This week. Do you think Jeb Bush [the former Florida governor] is going to file his statement? I don't know what's going on. I just heard it today that he hasn't filed. I assume he would have been filed. His should be simple, you know, in comparison to mine. I have so many companies and corporations.\par \par \uc2 Many Republican officials have asked you to tone down your immigration comments. It doesn't seem like you're listening to their advice.\par \par \uc2 I respect the people in the \uc2 Republican Party\uc2 , but this is a very important issue and it can't be toned down. It's an issue that wants to be silenced. Remember I told you the story about the guy they were going after, that killer, and when they heard he was he was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  it was like he was protected? If he were a citizen, they'd put him in jail for life.\par \par \uc2 How did you come up with "the silent majority" as a theme for your Saturday speech?\par \par \uc2 I was just thinking about it today. When I heard about this overwhelming \u8212\'20\'14 I'm telling you, it was 500 people at the start and the hotel called us begging to be released. They said they never had anything like this and we had to move the venue. I said to myself, 'That's the silent majority.'\par \par \uc2 You don't care about the Nixon overtones?\par \par \uc2 Nah. Nobody remembers that. Oh, is that why people stopped using [the phrase]? Maybe. Nobody thinks of Nixon. I don't think of Nixon when I think of the silent majority. The silent majority today, they're going to vote for Trump. Remember, many Republicans didn't vote for \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2 . He didn't inspire people. They're going to vote for me. And I'll also get the Hispanics, you watch.\par \par \uc2 What do they see in you?\par \par \uc2 They see somebody who's going to turn the country around \u8212\'20\'14 somebody who has the ability to turn this country around. They're tired of the incompetence. When you see my [financial] statement, you'll be very impressed. That's why it's important. Let's say I was worth $10. People would say, "Who the [expletive] are you?" You understand? They know my statement. Fortune. My book, "The Art of the Deal," based on my fortune. If I didn't make a fortune, who the [expletive] is going to buy "The Art of the Deal"? That's why they watched "The Apprentice," because of my great success.\par \par \uc2 Do you see your bid as similar to \uc2 Ross Perot\uc2 's 1992 maverick presidential campaign?\par \par \uc2 No. I don't consider Perot a movement. This is a movement. It's a different movement than I think you've ever seen before. Angry, sad, disappointed, devastated by what's happened to the country. Mourning. Some of these people who've lost their kids to [illegal immigrants], it's mourning. I spoke to one of the mothers today who came to see me, lost her son five years ago. It was like it was yesterday. Their lives are [expletive] over. She'll never be happy. This campaign is about making America great again. I copyrighted it.\par \par \uc2 What the [expletive] else do you have? Are you finished yet?\par \par \uc2 [Trump turns back to Fox, which is again covering the accused San Francisco killer. "Look at this animal. Now he's claiming innocence. He's got the lawyer now," Trump said. He stands up and opens another Coke, not to go on the record again.]\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020150712eb7c004jy\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHOENIX \u8212\'20\'14 Republican presidential candidate \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 , whose caustic comments about Mexicans have inflamed the immigration debate, told thousands of cheering supporters here Saturday that "we have to take back the heart of our country."\par \par \uc2 In a rambling, defiant speech delivered in this border state that has been the epicenter of the nation's divisive battle over immigration reform, Trump declared: "These are people that shouldn't be in our country. They flow in like water." One man in the crowd of 4,200 shouted back, "Build a wall!"\par \par \uc2 Basking in polls that show he has risen to the top of the crowded Republican field, Trump took obvious glee in mocking former Florida governor Jeb Bush, the establishment favorite who is setting fundraising records.\par \par \uc2 "Jeb Bush, let's say he's president \u8212\'20\'14 Oy, yoy, yoy," Trump said. He asked the crowd: "How can I be tied with this guy? He's terrible. Terrible. He's weak on immigration."\par \par \uc2 Trump's 70-minute address here, which sounded more like a stream-of-consciousness rant than a presidential-style stump speech, put an exclamation point on his bombastic push since his presidential announcement last month to return immigration to the forefront of the national conversation.\par \par \uc2 Bush and illegal immigrants were not the only targets of Trump's scorn: He also criticized \uc2 Macy's\uc2 , NBC, \uc2 NASCAR\uc2 , U.S. ambassador to Japan Caroline Kennedy, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton and, several times, the media.\par \par \uc2 Republican leaders say they believe the celebrity billionaire has virtually no chance of being their nominee, much less of making it to the White House. And, for now at least, his following seems limited to the far right as opposed to the party's mainstream.\par \par \uc2 Yet Trump has reignited a heated debate over an issue, immigration, that the GOP had been determined to settle after it hurt Republicans in the most recent presidential election.\par \par \uc2 Party leaders increasingly fear that Trump could do damage to more viable candidates, such as Bush, who could lose their own footing on immigration. These candidates confront a familiar challenge: During the primary season, they must deal with the anger and anxiety that many on the right feel about illegal immigration. But they must do it in a way that will not damage their appeal to a broader electorate in November 2016.\par \par \uc2 Republicans are handling Trump delicately for another reason as well: They fear that he could leave the GOP entirely and wage a well-funded third-party campaign, a possibility that Trump has not ruled out.\par \par \uc2 After Trump repeatedly referred to illegal immigrants in the harshest of terms \u8212\'20\'14 calling them, among other things, killers and rapists \u8212\'20\'14 Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus called Trump and asked him to tone things down. But that, if anything, has reinvigorated Trump and his vocal supporters.\par \par \uc2 The crowd in Phoenix began lining up outside the convention center before dawn, with many spending hours in temperatures that exceeded 100 degrees. Hundreds of people, who stood in lines snaking down several downtown blocks, did not make it into the ballroom for his speech.\par \par \uc2 Many of Trump's supporters blame illegal immigrants for crime and economic problems but also express dismay over cultural changes.\par \par \uc2 "We don't recognize our country anymore," said Jan Drake, 72, who lives in a retirement community outside Phoenix. "If you're coming into our country, you have got to conform to what we stand for. You speak English. You don't try to change our country to what your country was."\par \par \uc2 After watching Trump on television the past couple of weeks, Drake said that she has become convinced that "he would be a very strong president. He doesn't kowtow to anybody. The \uc2 Republican Party\uc2  will try to squeeze him out because they're afraid of him. But he can tell them where to go \u8212\'20\'14 to pound sand."\par \par \uc2 After he walked onto a catwalk stage here like a rock star, Trump basked in his crowd. "The word is getting out that we have to stop illegal immigration," he said.\par \par \uc2 While Trump was railing against Spanish-language broadcaster Univision, a handful of protesters in the crowd interrupted. Trump's security guards arrived to break up the skirmish that followed. His supporters screamed "USA! USA! USA!" in the protesters' faces as the guards escorted them out of the convention hall.\par \par \uc2 "I wonder if the Mexican government sent them over here," Trump said from the stage. He assured the crowd, "Don't worry, we'll take our country back."\par \par \uc2 Trump also had harsh words for \uc2 Islamic State\uc2  terrorists. If he becomes president, Trump said, "They will be in such trouble .\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09. ISIS, believe me, I would take them out so fast. You have to do it."\par \par \uc2 But it was his crusade against illegal immigrants that had Trump's crowd most enthused. After expressing shock that his immigration message has resonated so strongly with the GOP base, Trump said, "The silent majority is back, and we're going to take the country back." He walked off the stage to Twisted Sister's "We're Not Gonna Take It."\par \par \uc2 Earlier, as his plush \uc2 Boeing\uc2  757 headed from an appearance in Las Vegas to Phoenix, Trump sat in a leather chair, surrounded by binders of articles about him and sipping a \uc2 Coca-Cola\uc2  \u8212\'20\'14 the full-calorie kind, he noted, because, "Have you ever seen a thin person drinking Diet Coke?"\par \par \uc2 "Something is happening in America. You may not want to see it, but something big is happening. People are sick and tired of politicians, and I'm here for them," he said in an interview. "I'm ready to go right at the Mexican government. I'm going to charge them $25,000 per \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  and, oh, I'll make them pay."\par \par \uc2 (In his Phoenix speech, Trump put the figure at $100,000.)\par \par \uc2 "Would Bush do that? Would Rubio? I don't think so," Trump added, taking aim at two of his more mainstream rivals, Bush and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.).\par \par \uc2 Polls consistently show that a majority of Americans, including most Republicans, support an overhaul of the law to give millions of undocumented immigrants a means of staying in this country legally. But a passionate fraction of the Republican electorate believe otherwise.\par \par \uc2 Lou Brudnock, 71, said he is attracted to Trump's brash "truthfulness" on immigration and his willingness to be politically incorrect.\par \par \uc2 "This country today is sad, sad, sad," Brudnock said. "You can't say anything or they call you 'a racist.' It's like we're back in Nazi Germany. But look around, man. It's people here reading and listening to his message."\par \par \uc2 Trump, by virtue of his celebrity, has provoked a backlash far more widespread than ever seen toward lesser-known immigration hard-liners, such as former Colorado congressman Tom Tancredo (R). That means he could leave lasting damage to the GOP and whoever turns out to be its 2016 standard-bearer.\par \par \uc2 All of those cross-pressures were in play Saturday at Trump's appearances here and in Las Vegas. More mainstream Republicans had anticipated the spectacle and made no secret of their concern.\par \par \uc2 "I had hoped that we had moved on from some of the coarse rhetoric," said Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.). "When there's so many candidates, you can appeal to a very small segment of the population and get news and get elevated." Flake is a leading proponent of a comprehensive immigration measure that would include a path to citizenship for those who are in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 Arizona has been a hotbed of anti-immigration sentiment, having passed a 2010 law that requires law enforcement officials to check the immigration status of people they detain and suspect are in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 Maricopa County, Ariz., Sheriff Joe Arpaio \u8212\'20\'14 who in some ways is the face of that law, having been the subject of racial-profiling lawsuits \u8212\'20\'14 helped warm up the crowd before Trump's arrival.\par \par \uc2 "I know that \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  is speaking out," Arpaio said. "He's getting a lot of heat. But, you know, there's a silent majority out here."\par \par \uc2 "We're not silent anymore!" a man in the crowd shouted.\par \par \uc2 Arpaio brought up the mostly dormant questioning of President Obama's birth certificate.

Advisers to Bush and Rubio, for instance, say that their candidates can play a long game on the issue, continuing to make a case for comprehensive changes to the law, while waiting for the Trump boomlet to subside.\par \par \uc2 "You can give a fuller picture of those types of people who are coming to America who are not documented, who are not legal," said Peter Wehner, who was a top official in George W. Bush's White House.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SOMEWHERE ABOVE THE AMERICAN SOUTHWEST \u8212\'20\'14 It was Saturday night aboard \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 's gleaming \uc2 Boeing\uc2  757. An hour earlier, he had finished the most high-profile speech of his nearly month-old presidential campaign: a rally attended by thousands in Phoenix where he railed against illegal immigration and countless other targets \u8212\'20\'14 \uc2 Macy's\uc2 , NBC, \uc2 NASCAR\uc2 , U.S. ambassador to Japan Caroline Kennedy \u8212\'20\'14 for 70 minutes. The billionaire real-estate mogul took his jacket off, clicked the oversized satellite television in his plush, cream-colored cabin over to Fox News and closely watched the channel's coverage.\par \par \uc2 As shadowy images of Hispanic immigrants and criminal mug shots were interspersed with his remarks, Trump, 69, turned gleeful. "The only reason they're talking about this is because of me," he said. "Look at that crowd, fantastic, he added. He sat down in his leather chair \u8212\'20\'14 his eponymous crest woven into the headrest and his plane 30,000 feet above the border he had in the afternoon called so porous that illegal immigrants are able to "flow in like water."\par \par \uc2 In an expletive-laden interview over soft drinks \u8212\'20\'14 Trump sips from a small plastic bottle of \uc2 Coca-Cola\uc2  \u8212\'20\'14 the celebrity contender said he has no plans to change the way he's running for the Republican nomination, which combines his trademark showmanship, an outsider-populist credo that resists ideological categorization, and incendiary comments that have thrilled conservative activists.\par \par \uc2 Trump was most animated when analyzing the way the press covered him and dishing with aides about the articles they had printed out. He was less excited discussing the process of presidential politics. When asked about the upcoming debate, set for Aug. 6 in Cleveland, he shrugged and said, "Whatever." When asked about calls for him to tone down his fiery pitch, he shrugged again.\par \par \uc2 Following is a lightly edited transcript:\par \par \uc2 What's next?\par \par \uc2 More of the same, I'll keep doing my thing. I'll go around to different places, get great receptivity. I get the biggest crowds. I get the biggest standing ovations. You saw that today, I could have been there for 20 minutes and they would have been cheering. So, you'll see more of the same, getting the word out.\par \par \uc2 Will immigration remain your focus?\par \par \uc2 No. It's just one of the things. It's not only immigration. It's about trade. They go hand in hand. Immigration is one of the things you have to do. I'm also a moralist. You heard what I said today about health care. I said, I'm sorry, folks, but we have to take care people that don't have money. I know it's not the conservative thing to say but I got a standing ovation \u8212\'20\'14 and these were very conservative people. We can't let people down when they can't get any medical care, when they're sick and don't have money to go to a doctor. You help them.\par \par \uc2 So Trump has a heart?\par \par \uc2 A big heart, let me tell you. Too big.\par \par \uc2 When did you decide to seize on immigration and make it the thrust of your campaign?\par \par \uc2 They gave it to me. It wasn't a big part of my announcement speech \u8212\'20\'14 a small paragraph. The Democrats and the enemies lined up and they criticized me for one line where I said Mexico is sending \u8212\'20\'14 I said Mexico is sending. I didn't say people are coming over and they're bad people. They would leave off the 'Mexico is sending' part, chop it and say I said 'rapists' when talking about people.\par \par \uc2 But when you use a word like rapist\u8230\'20\'26\par \par \uc2 It is a very rough word. It's okay to use.\par \par \uc2 [Eyeing the television, Trump gets up to watch another Fox News segment about his Arizona gathering. "Jeanine Pirro, let's see what he she has to say about me," he said as he settled into his couch. When a picture of the Mexican laborer accused of killing a San Francisco woman is put on screen, Trump said: "Look at that guy, look at what he did, killing that beautiful girl. [Expletive] animal." He returned several minutes later to continue the interview.]\par \par \uc2 Are you looking forward to the debate?\par \par \uc2 No, not one way or the other. Whatever. I don't look forward or not look forward. It is what it is.\par \par \uc2 When are you going to file your financial disclosure with the \uc2 Federal Election Commission\uc2 ?\par \par \uc2 This week. Do you think Jeb Bush [the former Florida governor] is going to file his statement? I don't know what's going on. I just heard it today that he hasn't filed. I assume he would have been filed. His should be simple, you know, in comparison to mine. I have so many companies and corporations.\par \par \uc2 Many Republican officials have asked you to tone down your immigration comments. It doesn't seem like you're listening to their advice.\par \par \uc2 I respect the people in the \uc2 Republican Party\uc2  but this is a very important issue and it can't be toned down. It's an issue that wants to be silenced. Remember I told you the story about the guy they were going after, that killer, and when they heard he was he was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  it was like he was protected? If he were a citizen, they'd put him in jail for life.\par \par \uc2 How did you come up with "the silent majority" as a theme for your Saturday speech?\par \par \uc2 I was just thinking about it today. When I heard about this overwhelming \u8212\'20\'14 I'm telling you, it was 500 people at the start and the hotel called us begging to be released. They said they never had anything like this and we had to move the venue. I said to myself, 'That's the silent majority.'\par \par \uc2 You don't care about the Nixon overtones?\par \par \uc2 Nah. Nobody remembers that. Oh, is that why people stopped using [the phrase]? Maybe. Nobody thinks of Nixon. I don't think of Nixon when I think of the silent majority. The silent majority today, they're going to vote for Trump. Remember, many Republicans didn't vote for \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2 . He didn't inspire people. They're going to vote for me. And I'll also get the Hispanics, you watch.\par \par \uc2 What do they see in you?\par \par \uc2 They see somebody who's going to turn the country around \u8212\'20\'14 somebody who has the ability to turn this country around. They're tired of the incompetence. When you see my [financial] statement, you'll be very impressed. That's why it's important. Let's say I was worth $10. People would say, "Who the [expletive] are you?" You understand? They know my statement. Fortune. My book, "The Art of the Deal," based on my fortune. If I didn't make a fortune, who the [expletive] is going to buy "The Art of the Deal"? That's why they watched "The Apprentice," because of my great success.\par \par \uc2 Do you see your campaign as similar to \uc2 Ross Perot\uc2 's 1992 maverick presidential campaign?\par \par \uc2 No. I don't consider Perot a movement. This is a movement. It's a different movement than I think you've ever seen before. Angry, sad, disappointed, devastated by what's happened to the country. Mourning. Some of these people who've lost their kids to [illegal immigrants], it's mourning. I spoke to one of the mothers today who came to see me, lost her son five years ago. It was like it was yesterday. Their lives are [expletive] over. She'll never be happy. This campaign is about making America great again. I copyrighted it.\par \par \uc2 What the [expletive] else do you have? Are you finished yet?\par \par \uc2 [Trump turns back to Fox, which is again covering the accused San Francisco killer. "Look at this animal. Now he's claiming innocence. He's got the lawyer now," Trump said. He stands up and opens another Coke, not to go on record again.]\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020150712eb7c004ed\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved   \par \par \uc2 PHOENIX - Republican presidential candidate \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 , whose caustic comments about Mexicans have inflamed the immigration debate, told thousands of cheering supporters here Saturday that "we have to take back the heart of our country."\par \par \uc2 In a rambling, defiant speech delivered in this border state that has been the epicenter of the nation's divisive battle over immigration reform, Trump declared: "These are people that shouldn't be in our country. They flow in like water." One man in the crowd of 4,200 shouted back, "Build a wall!"\par \par \uc2 Basking in polls that show he has risen to the top of the crowded Republican field, Trump took obvious glee in mocking former Florida governor Jeb Bush, the establishment favorite who is setting fundraising records.\par \par \uc2 "Jeb Bush, let's say he's president - Oy, yoy, yoy," Trump said. He asked the crowd: "How can I be tied with this guy? He's terrible. Terrible. He's weak on immigration."\par \par \uc2 Trump's 70-minute address here, which sounded more like a stream-of-consciousness rant than a presidential-style stump speech, put an exclamation point on his bombastic push since his presidential announcement last month to return immigration to the forefront of the national conversation.\par \par \uc2 Bush and illegal immigrants were not the only targets of Trump's scorn: He also criticized \uc2 Macy's\uc2 , NBC, \uc2 NASCAR\uc2 , U.S. ambassador to Japan Caroline Kennedy, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton and, several times, the media.\par \par \uc2 Republican leaders say they believe the celebrity billionaire has virtually no chance of being their nominee, much less of making it to the White House. And, for now at least, his following seems limited to the far right as opposed to the party's mainstream.\par \par \uc2 Yet Trump has reignited a heated debate over an issue, immigration, that the GOP had been determined to settle after it hurt Republicans in the most recent presidential election.\par \par \uc2 Party leaders increasingly fear that Trump could do damage to more viable candidates, such as Bush, who could lose their own footing on immigration. These candidates confront a familiar challenge: During the primary season, they must deal with the anger and anxiety that many on the right feel about illegal immigration. But they must do it in a way that will not damage their appeal to a broader electorate in November 2016.\par \par \uc2 Republicans are handling Trump delicately for another reason as well: They fear that he could leave the GOP entirely and wage a well-funded third-party campaign, a possibility that Trump has not ruled out.\par \par \uc2 [GOP leaders fear damage to party's image as \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  doubles down]\par \par \uc2 After Trump repeatedly referred to illegal immigrants in the harshest of terms - calling them, among other things, killers and rapists - Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus called Trump and asked him to tone things down. But that, if anything, has reinvigorated Trump and his vocal supporters.\par \par \uc2 The crowd in Phoenix began lining up outside the convention center before dawn, with many spending hours in temperatures that exceeded 100 degrees. Hundreds of people, who stood in lines snaking down several downtown blocks, did not make it into the ballroom for his speech.\par \par \uc2 Many of Trump's supporters blame illegal immigrants for crime and economic problems but also express dismay over cultural changes.\par \par \uc2 "We don't recognize our country anymore," said Jan Drake, 72, who lives in a retirement community outside Phoenix. "If you're coming into our country, you have got to conform to what we stand for. You speak English. You don't try to change our country to what your country was."\par \par \uc2 After watching Trump on television the past couple of weeks, Drake said that she has become convinced that "he would be a very strong president. He doesn't kowtow to anybody. The \uc2 Republican Party\uc2  will try to squeeze him out because they're afraid of him. But he can tell them where to go - to pound sand."\par \par \uc2 After he walked onto a catwalk stage here like a rock star, Trump basked in his crowd. "The word is getting out that we have to stop illegal immigration," he said.\par \par \uc2 While Trump was railing against Spanish-language broadcaster Univision, a handful of protesters in the crowd interrupted. Trump's security guards arrived to break up the skirmish that followed. His supporters screamed "USA! USA! USA!" in the protesters' faces as the guards escorted them out of the convention hall.\par \par \uc2 "I wonder if the Mexican government sent them over here," Trump said from the stage. He assured the crowd, "Don't worry, we'll take our country back."\par \par \uc2 Trump also had harsh words for \uc2 Islamic State\uc2  terrorists. If he becomes president, Trump said, "They will be in such trouble . . . ISIS, believe me, I would take them out so fast. You have to do it."\par \par \uc2 But it was his crusade against illegal immigrants that had Trump's crowd most enthused. After expressing shock that his immigration message has resonated so strongly with the GOP base, Trump said, "The silent majority is back, and we're going to take the country back." He walked off the stage to Twisted Sister's "We're Not Gonna Take It."\par \par \uc2 Earlier, as his plush \uc2 Boeing\uc2  757 headed from an appearance in Las Vegas to Phoenix, Trump sat in a leather chair, surrounded by binders of articles about him and sipping a \uc2 Coca-Cola\uc2  - the full-calorie kind, he noted, because, "Have you ever seen a thin person drinking Diet Coke?"\par \par \uc2 "Something is happening in America. You may not want to see it, but something big is happening. People are sick and tired of politicians, and I'm here for them," he said in an interview. "I'm ready to go right at the Mexican government. I'm going to charge them $25,000 per \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  and, oh, I'll make them pay."\par \par \uc2 (In his Phoenix speech, Trump put the figure at $100,000.)\par \par \uc2 "Would Bush do that? Would Rubio? I don't think so," Trump added, taking aim at two of his more mainstream rivals, Bush and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.).\par \par \uc2 Polls consistently show that a majority of Americans, including most Republicans, support an overhaul of the law to give millions of undocumented immigrants a means of staying in this country legally. But a passionate fraction of the Republican electorate believe otherwise.\par \par \uc2 Lou Brudnock, 71, said he is attracted to Trump's brash "truthfulness" on immigration and his willingness to be politically incorrect.\par \par \uc2 "This country today is sad, sad, sad," Brudnock said. "You can't say anything or they call you 'a racist.' It's like we're back in Nazi Germany. But look around, man. It's people here reading and listening to his message."\par \par \uc2 Trump, by virtue of his celebrity, has provoked a backlash far more widespread than ever seen toward lesser-known immigration hard-liners, such as former Colorado congressman Tom Tancredo (R). That means he could leave lasting damage to the GOP and whoever turns out to be its 2016 standard-bearer.\par \par \uc2 All of those cross-pressures were in play Saturday at Trump's appearances here and in Las Vegas. More mainstream Republicans had anticipated the spectacle and made no secret of their concern.\par \par \uc2 "I had hoped that we had moved on from some of the coarse rhetoric," said Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.). "When there's so many candidates, you can appeal to a very small segment of the population and get news and get elevated." Flake is a leading proponent of a comprehensive immigration measure that would include a path to citizenship for those who are in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 Arizona has been a hotbed of anti-immigration sentiment, having passed a 2010 law that requires law enforcement officials to check the immigration status of people they detain and suspect are in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 Maricopa County, Ariz., Sheriff Joe Arpaio - who in some ways is the face of that law, having been the subject of racial-profiling lawsuits - helped warm up the crowd before Trump's arrival.\par \par \uc2 "I know that \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  is speaking out," Arpaio said. "He's getting a lot of heat. But, you know, there's a silent majority out here."\par \par \uc2 "We're not silent anymore!" a man in the crowd shouted.\par \par \uc2 Arpaio brought up the mostly dormant questioning of President Obama's birth certificate. He and Trump are perhaps the most vocal of the "birthers," who falsely contend that Obama was not born in the United States.\par \par \uc2 Immigration also has gained new attention after the June 30 shooting death of a woman along San Francisco's heavily touristed waterfront, allegedly by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who had been deported five times from the United States.\par \par \uc2 Trump - along with much of the rest of the Republican field - has criticized the policies of "sanctuary cities," where officials cannot detain those they suspect of being in the country illegally unless they have other grounds to do so.\par \par \uc2 Republican strategists say that it is possible to address anxiety over illegal immigration within the GOP base without alienating the electorate at large. Advisers to Bush and Rubio, for instance, say that their candidates can play a long game on the issue, continuing to make a case for comprehensive changes to the law, while waiting for the Trump boomlet to subside.\par \par \uc2 "You can give a fuller picture of those types of people who are coming to America who are not documented, who are not legal," said Peter Wehner, who was a top official in George W. Bush's White House. "And you can speak about them in a humane and decent and true way."\par \par \uc2 Karen Tumulty\uc2  in Washington contributed to this report. \par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com\par \par \uc2 WP20150712trump0712\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020150712eb7c00009\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 erik-wemple\par {\*\bkmkstart toc74}{\*\bkmkend toc74}\b \uc2 Fox News's Megyn Kelly crosses key line on San Francisco killing ; Are these the words of a 'straight-news anchor'?\b0\par\par\uc2 By Erik Wemple   \par \uc2 676 \uc2 words\par \uc2 10 July 2015\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2015, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Journalistic line-crossing received scrutiny on last night's edition of "The O'Reilly Factor." Bernard Goldberg, a regular on the program, criticized a segment that had aired the previous night on the program, as Jesse Watters visited San Francisco with an ambushing camera crew seeking answers from city officials on whether their failures contributed to the killing of 32-year-old Kathryn Steinle, allegedly at the hands of a Mexican laborer who had been deported five times. Watters spoke at an open session of the San Francisco board of supervisors and cornered a spokeswoman for Mayor Ed Lee, a series of encounters praised\u160\'00\'A0on this blog.\par \par \uc2 [More: Fox News's Jesse Watters shows ambush journalism at its best]\par \par \uc2 Goldberg differed on the matter: "It's wrong," said Goldberg in a discussion with O'Reilly. "It's just as wrong as if \uc2 MSNBC\uc2  sent somebody out to a City Council some place in America and advocated for something that you and I don't agree with. We would say what a bunch of clowns. You just don't do that. That crosses the line. And, look, I will tell you this. I was sitting at home watching that, sitting on my couch and I was embarrassed watching it."\par \par \uc2 Credit "The O'Reilly Factor" with allowing some ombudsmanesque criticism. There's little question that Watters did some grandstanding in California, but the Steinle killing is a outrage that demands genuine accountability from elected leaders \u8212\'20\'14 a great time to roll out the ambush. Of all the lines that "The O'Reilly Factor" crosses, Watters's San Francisco trip figures among the least concerning. Consider that O'Reilly constantly plugs his books on air, sometimes subordinating the program's editorial content to this self-interested mission. Consider that he's now pushing a bill to punish undocumented immigrants who had been deported (O'Reilly apprised viewers of his venture into activism). And finally, consider that O'Reilly on various platforms has been caught telling falsehoods about his reportorial exploits of yore. Now there's a line.\par \par \uc2 Speaking of lines: Megyn Kelly last night sounded more like O'Reilly than O'Reilly. She opened her program with this editorial:\par \par \uc2 Kate's murder has since exploded into a national debate on \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , sanctuary cities in crime. With the White House ducking the issue of its own acquiescence in these city's decision to flout the federal immigration laws which were duly enacted. When asked repeatedly this week to speak to this case, White House Spokesman Josh Earnest declined to weigh in other than to refer folks to the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2 . A stark contrast to what we saw after Michael Brown was killed in Ferguson, Missouri. A man we now know was attacking a police officer at the time of his death. His funeral saw three \uc2 Obama\uc2  officials in attendance, his death drew comments from President \uc2 Obama\uc2  personally. And the administration also sent in the DOJ and 40 \uc2 FBI\uc2  agents dispatched to Missouri after Michael Brown was killed. Where is the swarm of agents in San Francisco? Then there was Freddie Gray in Baltimore, a repeat drug offender who was killed in police custody. Here again his funeral was attended by three \uc2 Obama\uc2  administration officials and again the President spoke personally to Freddie Gray's death. And again, sent the DOJ in to investigate. When Trayvon Martin was killed in Florida, the President spoke to his death which was later ruled to be in self-defense. But Kate Steinle, nothing. No comments, no swarm of \uc2 FBI\uc2  agents, no DOJ investigation, nothing. Why?\par \par \uc2 Later in the segment, Kelly said of President \uc2 Obama\uc2 , "He picks and chooses the victims he wants to highlight and apparently this victim wasn't deemed worthy."\par \par \uc2 Those words come from an anchor who said, "I'm a straight-news anchor. I'm not one of the opinion hosts at Fox."\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020150710eb7a00565\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Journalistic line-crossing received scrutiny on last night's edition of "The O'Reilly Factor." Bernard Goldberg, a regular on the program, criticized a segment that had aired the previous night on the program, as Jesse Watters visited San Francisco with an ambushing camera crew seeking answers from city officials on whether their failures contributed to the killing of 32-year-old Kathryn Steinle, allegedly at the hands of a Mexican laborer who had been deported five times. Watters spoke at an open session of the San Francisco board of supervisors and cornered a spokeswoman for Mayor Ed Lee, a series of encounters praised on this blog.\par \par \uc2 Goldberg differed on the matter: "It's wrong," said Goldberg in a discussion with O'Reilly. "It's just as wrong as if \uc2 MSNBC\uc2  sent somebody out to a City Council some place in America and advocated for something that you and I don't agree with. We would say what a bunch of clowns. You just don't do that. That crosses the line. And, look, I will tell you this. I was sitting at home watching that, sitting on my couch and I was embarrassed watching it."\par \par \uc2 Credit "The O'Reilly Factor" with allowing some ombudsmanesque criticism. There's little question that Watters did some grandstanding in California, but the Steinle killing is a outrage that demands genuine accountability from elected leaders \u8212\'20\'14 a great time to roll out the ambush. Of all the lines that "The O'Reilly Factor" crosses, Watters's San Francisco trip figures among the least concerning. Consider that O'Reilly constantly plugs his books on air, sometimes subordinating the program's editorial content to this self-interested mission. Consider that he's now pushing a bill to punish undocumented immigrants who had been deported (O'Reilly apprised viewers of his venture into activism). And finally, consider that O'Reilly on various platforms has been caught telling falsehoods about his reportorial exploits of yore. Now there's a line.\par \par \uc2 Speaking of lines: Megyn Kelly last night sounded more like O'Reilly than O'Reilly. She opened her program with this editorial:\par \par \uc2 Kate's murder has since exploded into a national debate on \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , sanctuary cities in crime. With the White House ducking the issue of its own acquiescence in these city's decision to flout the federal immigration laws which were duly enacted. When asked repeatedly this week to speak to this case, White House Spokesman Josh Earnest declined to weigh in other than to refer folks to the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2 . A stark contrast to what we saw after Michael Brown was killed in Ferguson, Missouri. A man we now know was attacking a police officer at the time of his death. His funeral saw three \uc2 Obama\uc2  officials in attendance, his death drew comments from President \uc2 Obama\uc2  personally. And the administration also sent in the DOJ and 40 \uc2 FBI\uc2  agents dispatched to Missouri after Michael Brown was killed. Where is the swarm of agents in San Francisco? Then there was Freddie Gray in Baltimore, a repeat drug offender who was killed in police custody. Here again his funeral was attended by three \uc2 Obama\uc2  administration officials and again the President spoke personally to Freddie Gray's death. And again, sent the DOJ in to investigate. When Trayvon Martin was killed in Florida, the President spoke to his death which was later ruled to be in self-defense. But Kate Steinle, nothing. No comments, no swarm of \uc2 FBI\uc2  agents, no DOJ investigation, nothing. Why?\par \par \uc2 Later in the segment, Kelly said of President \uc2 Obama\uc2 , "He picks and chooses the victims he wants to highlight and apparently this victim wasn't deemed worthy."\par \par \uc2 Those words come from an anchor who said, "I'm a straight-news anchor. I'm not one of the opinion hosts at Fox."\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020150710eb7a00461\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Editorial-Opinion\par {\*\bkmkstart toc76}{\*\bkmkend toc76}\b \uc2 A pass for criminals\b0\par\par\uc2 By Editorial Board   \par \uc2 528 \uc2 words\par \uc2 10 July 2015\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2015, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 FOR YEARS, San Francisco law enforcement agencies have refused to work with federal immigration authorities, insisting that cooperation would subvert their efforts to cultivate good relations with the city's highly diverse immigrant communities. In practice, the city's sanctuary policy, applied blindly, subverts common sense by allowing dangerous criminals a free pass.\par \par \uc2 The latest victim of this triumph of doctrine over public safety was Kathryn Steinle, a 32-year-old woman who died July 1, according to police, after being shot in the chest by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who has been deported five times in the past two decades and has a criminal record in four states reaching back to 1991, including multiple drug convictions.\par \par \uc2 The accused immigrant, Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, had served various prison terms before he was transferred to San Francisco in March on an outstanding arrest warrant. Three weeks later, he was released from the city jail after local prosecutors dropped a decade-old drug charge against him. Rather than notifiying \uc2 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2  (ICE), which had requested a heads-up so it could deport Mr. Lopez-Sanchez, the jail put him on the street without a word.\par \par \uc2 Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi, who runs the jail, defended the release as consistent with the city's long-standing sanctuary policy. In fact, the policy allows authorities to exercise some discretion, particularly in the case of convicted felons. But in practice, Mr. Mirkarimi and other San Francisco officials have treated ICE as the enemy, stiff-arming all attempts at dialogue, cooperation or plain courtesy. Had the sheriff's office \u8212\'20\'14 which could easily have seen Mr. Lopez-Sanchez's extensive rap sheet \u8212\'20\'14 simply made a phone call to notify ICE of his scheduled release, he could have been handed over and deported. And Ms. Steinle would be alive.\par \par \uc2 Ostensibly, the city prides itself on protecting undocumented immigrants who it thinks might be unjustly expelled if they are arrested for traffic infractions and other minor violations. In fact, the Obama administration has made clear that its priorities for deportation are serious criminals and recent illegal border-crossers \u8212\'20\'14 not law-abiding immigrants with long-standing ties to communities.\par \par \uc2 That is a reasonable approach, and localities around the country with sanctuary policies \u8212\'20\'14 there are some 300 of them, though few operate as unyieldingly as San Francisco \u8212\'20\'14 should take note. No convicted felon, let alone one with multiple narcotics convictions, deserves sanctuary in the United States.\par \par \uc2 That would seem a statement of common sense, but not, apparently, in California. Of roughly 200,000 detention requests issued by ICE to local law enforcement agencies nationwide since the beginning of last year, fewer than 10 percent were declined. Of those declined, more than 60 percent were in California.\par \par \uc2 Now, as a consequence of Ms. Steinle's death, shaken California officials are starting to rethink their intransigence. San Francisco Mayor Edwin M. Lee, a Democrat and himself the son of immigrants, is calling for a review of the sanctuary policy, saying it "was never designed to harbor repeat serious offenders."\par \par \uc2 What a disgrace that it took a tragedy to prompt that realization.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020150710eb7a000dy\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

And some, I assume, are good people."\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14Real estate mogul Donald Trump, presidential announcement speech , June 16, 2015\par \par \uc2 "I can never apologize for the truth. I don't mind apologizing for things. But I can't apologize for the truth. I said tremendous crime is coming across. Everybody knows that's true. And it's happening all the time. So, why, when I mention, all of a sudden I'm a racist. I'm not a racist. I don't have a racist bone in my body."\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14Trump, interview on \uc2 Fox News\uc2 ' "Media Buzz," July 5, 2015\par \par \uc2 "What can be simpler or more accurately stated? The Mexican Government is forcing their most unwanted people into the United States. They are, in many cases, criminals, drug dealers, rapists, etc ."\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14Trump, statement about his June 16 comments, July 6, 2015\par \par \uc2 Several readers asked us to fact-check Trump's initial comment, which has drawn outrage from Latino groups and led to breakups with his corporate partners distancing themselves from the inflammatory remarks.\par \par \uc2 This posed a conundrum for The Fact Checker. We had fact checked most of his statements from his news conference announcing his effort to win the GOP presidential nomination, but many of those were in the realm of domestic and international policy. We tend not to wade into fact checking incendiary comments that some might label opinion.\par \par \uc2 But Trump's statement \u8212\'20\'14 which he repeatedly has defended \u8212\'20\'14 underscores public perceptions\u160\'00\'A0that can drive immigration policies. For example, the 2010 murder of a rancher by a suspected smuggler in an Arizona border city fueled public and political pressure on then-Gov. \uc2 Jan Brewer\uc2  to sign the controversial anti-immigrant Senate Bill 1070 into law.\par \par \uc2 What do the data tell us about the criminal threat of immigrants?\par \par \uc2 The Facts\par \par \uc2 Data on immigrants and crime are incomplete, but a\u160\'00\'A0range of studies show there is no evidence immigrants commit more crimes than native-born Americans. In fact, first-generation immigrants\u160\'00\'A0are predisposed to lower crime rates than native-born Americans.\u160\'00\'A0(The \uc2 Center for Immigration Studies\uc2 , which advocates for restrictive immigration laws, has a detailed report\u160\'00\'A0showing the shortfalls of immigrant crime data.)\par \par \uc2 Immigration and crime levels have had inverse\u160\'00\'A0trajectories\u160\'00\'A0since the 1990s: immigration has increased, while crime has decreased. Some experts\u160\'00\'A0say the influx of immigrants contributed to the decrease in crime rates, by increasing the denominator while not adding significantly to the numerator.\par \par \uc2 In his July 6 statement, Trump clarified that he was referring to cases where undocumented immigrants commit violent crimes or smuggle drugs. He pointed to the recent incident in San Francisco, where an\u160\'00\'A0undocumented immigrant and a repeat felon who had been deported five times to Mexico\u160\'00\'A0was arrested on suspicion of fatally shooting a woman.\par \par \uc2 Trump's campaign pointed to data from the \uc2 U.S. Sentencing Commission\uc2 , which tracks citizenship of offenders in federal prisons by primary offense, which is the offense with the longest maximum sentence when a person is convicted of multiple offenses.\u160\'00\'A0Of 78,022 primary offense cases in fiscal year 2013, 38.6 percent were \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  offenders. The majority of their cases (76 percent) were immigration related. Of total primary offenses,\u160\'00\'A017.6 percent of\u160\'00\'A0drug trafficking offenses and 3.8 percent of sex abuse were illegal immigrants. Of 22,878 drug crime cases, 17.2 percent were illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 But these numbers\u160\'00\'A0are not indicative of general crime trends of non-citizens. Federal prisoners made up 10 percent of the total incarcerated population in the United States in 2013. When asked how the data are indicative of the Mexican government sending criminals to the United States, or that there is a crime wave coming across the border, a Trump campaign adviser said: "The data speaks for itself."\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Congressional Research Service\uc2  found that the vast majority of unauthorized immigrants do not fit in the category that fits Trump's description:\u160\'00\'A0aggravated felons, whose crimes include murder, drug trafficking or illegal trafficking of firearms.\par \par \uc2 CRS also found\u160\'00\'A0that non-citizens make up a smaller percentage of the inmate population in state prisons and jails, compared to their percentage to the total U.S. population.\par \par \uc2 An analysis of 2010 Census data in a report from the \uc2 American Immigration Council\uc2 , a pro-immigration\u160\'00\'A0group, shows that 1.6 percent of immigrant males 18 to 39 years old were incarcerated, compared to 3.3 percent of native-born males. That disparity in incarceration rates has been consistent in the decennial Census since\u160\'00\'A01980, the report says.\par \par \uc2 The trend holds when comparing less educated Mexican, Salvadoran and Guatemalan men \u8212\'20\'14 who make up the bulk of the undocumented immigrant population \u8212\'20\'14 to their native-born counterparts, as shown below:\par \par \uc2 Are countries like Mexico "not sending their best"?\par \par \uc2 Immigration offenses\u160\'00\'A0account for the largest portion of federal convictions of immigrants (the majority of whom were from Mexico), followed by drug and traffic violations. Sex offenses comprised 1.6 percent of total crimes in 2013.\par \par \uc2 Inmate\u160\'00\'A0legal status is\u160\'00\'A0not always tracked at local jails or state prisons. The\u160\'00\'A0\uc2 Government Accountability Office\uc2 's\u160\'00\'A02011 analysis\u160\'00\'A0collected reports from 2003 to 2009 to the Department of Justice's State Criminal Alien Assistance Program, through which states and localities get reimbursed for convicting and incarcerating inmates\u160\'00\'A0of illegal or unknown immigration status (mainly from Mexico).\par \par \uc2 The GAO found that drug offenses made up the majority of convictions in fiscal year 2008 in the five states (Arizona, California, Florida, New York and Texas) with the largest populations of such inmates. These convictions were both felony and misdemeanor crimes,\u160\'00\'A0including use/under the influence, manufacturing, transporting and possession of paraphernalia.\par \par \uc2 Cartel- and gang-related arrests along the Texas southern border decreased after a border surge in 2014, the Houston Chronicle reported. In 2013, the Center for Investigative Reporting found that four out of five arrests for drug smuggling involved U.S. citizens.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2 \u160\'00\'A0in recent years has targeted\u160\'00\'A0immigration enforcement to those who committed serious crimes through efforts like Secure Communities, rolled out per county from 2008 through 2012. But a recent study\u160\'00\'A0showed that increased enforcement didn't lead to decreased crime, calling into question whether serious crimes were prevalent.\par \par \uc2 Researchers found Secure Communities did not result in a meaningful reduction in the \uc2 FBI\uc2 's overall index crime rate or in rates of violent crimes.\u160\'00\'A0There were modest reductions in burglary and motor vehicle theft, not serious crimes like homicides or violent crime. (This program is now on its way out.)\par \par \uc2 The theory is that immigrants\u160\'00\'A0generally have a stronger incentive than native-born Americans to stay out of legal trouble \u8212\'20\'14 especially undocumented immigrants, who risk deportation. And those who legally are in the United States (or are pursuing legal status) are required to pass a criminal background check.\par \par \uc2 "Immigrants in general \u8212\'20\'14 unauthorized immigrants in particular \u8212\'20\'14 are a self-selected group who generally come to the U.S. to work. And once they're here, most of them want to keep their nose down and do their business, and they're sensitive to the fact that they're vulnerable," said \uc2 Marc Rosenblum\uc2 , deputy director of the U.S. Immigration Policy Program at the \uc2 Migration Policy Institute\uc2 , a non-partisan think tank.\par \par \uc2 Interestingly, crime rates increase as generations of immigrants assimilate into America. Second-generation immigrants, who are born in the United States and have at least one foreign-born parent, are more likely to commit crimes than first-generation immigrants, and have similar crime rates as native-born Americans.\par \par \uc2 The Pinocchio Test\par \par \uc2 It's difficult to connect any crime with illegal immigration, by its nature. Drug smuggling and violent crimes do exist, but the cases are not indicative of larger trends in the immigrant population. What we do know about\u160\'00\'A0crime rates among non-citizens and inmates with unknown or unauthorized immigrant statuses show Trump's assertions about a crime wave are not accurate.\par \par \uc2 Trump's repeated statements about immigrants and crime underscore a common public perception\u160\'00\'A0that crime is correlated with immigration, especially illegal immigration.\u160\'00\'A0But that is a misperception; no solid data support it, and the data that do exist negate it. Trump can defend himself\u160\'00\'A0all he wants, but the facts just are not there.\par \par \uc2 Four Pinocchios\par \par \uc2 (About our rating scale)\par \par \uc2 Send us facts to check by filling out this form\par \par \uc2 Follow The Fact Checker on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and friend us on \uc2 Facebook\par \par \uc2 Click this link for more candidate fact checks\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020150708eb78001md\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

There aren't. ; His numbers vary widely from the Census Bureau and \uc2 DHS\uc2 .\b0\par\par\uc2 By Philip Bump   \par \uc2 743 \uc2 words\par \uc2 9 July 2015\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2015, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Donald Trump's illegal immigration victory tour\u160\'00\'A0entered its 22,000th day on Wednesday during an interview with Anderson Cooper on \uc2 CNN\uc2 . Continuing his habit of trying to rationalize his arguments by using questionable data, Trump emphasized the severity of the illegal immigration problem by noting the scale of the problem.\par \par \uc2 "You have anywhere from 11 to 34 million illegal immigrants," he told Cooper. "I used to hear 11, now I hear 34 million!"\par \par \uc2 He didn't say where he heard that. But 34\u160\'00\'A0million? That would mean that out of every 10\u160\'00\'A0people in America, one of them crossed a border illegally.\par \par \uc2 That number seems ... high.\par \par \uc2 Especially considering that, in its 2014 population estimate, the Census Bureau pegged the number of Hispanics in the United States at 50.2 million. If most of the illegal immigrants in Trump's 34 million are Hispanic, that means that an inordinate\u160\'00\'A0percentage of that population would be here illegally.\par \par \uc2 Census data also shows that the number of foreign-born residents in America is 40.3 million. So nearly all of them, in Trump's estimation, are here illegally. But it also means that most of Trump's illegal immigrants aren't Hispanic. You see, the bureau breaks down the ethnicity of the foreign-born, and only 18.8 million of them are members of that ethnic group.\par \par \uc2 In 2000, the bureau broke down the foreign-born population by country of birth. At the time, 29.5 percent of all foreign-born residents were from Mexico. If that ratio holds, it means that only 11.8 million of all of the foreign-born population in the most recent estimate came from that country.\par \par \uc2 But! That 40.3 million foreign-born population includes naturalized citizens. If you exclude them, the number of non-naturalized foreign-born Hispanics drops to 12.9 million.\par \par \uc2 So if Trump is right that there are as many as 34 million illegal immigrants, only 13 million of them are Hispanic.\par \par \uc2 That's if you trust the Census Bureau to provide\u160\'00\'A0an accurate estimate that includes illegal immigrants, which Trump and his fans would certainly argue we should not. Fine. There are other estimates of the undocumented immigrant population that stand outside the Census data. The most recent data for each is from 2012. Pew Research estimates that there were 11.2 million illegal immigrants that year. The \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2 , which probably pays more attention to this sort of thing than most, estimates 11.4 million -- substantially lower than Trump's estimate.\par \par \uc2 (Incidentally, Trump also said that "more people right now are in this country illegally than ever before." The 2012 figures are lower than shortly before the recession according to \uc2 DHS\uc2  -- and it has dropped according to Pew as well, which Cooper noted.)\par \par \uc2 Trump's broader point, of course, is that we need a wall on the Southern border to keep all the undocumented Mexican and Central American immigrants out. (He reiterated this to Cooper.) According to Pew and \uc2 DHS\uc2 , though, only about half of the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  population is from Mexico. \uc2 DHS\uc2  breaks out a number of other countries from which the immigrants originated: many from\u160\'00\'A0Central America, 310,000 from the Philippines, 260,000 from India, hundreds of thousands more from China, Korea and Vietnam.\par \par \uc2 So where did Trump's 34 million come from? Our guess is that he picked up on a rumor that spread through some far-right sites late last year that President Obama planned to issue 34 million green cards. That figure, as Snopes pointed out, derives from a request from\u160\'00\'A0U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services for a vendor that could handle the production of millions of green cards -- up to 34 million of them eventually. Potentially.\par \par \uc2 But maybe there are 34 million and the remainder\u160\'00\'A0came after 2012 and maybe they all came here because Mexico sent them, an ardent supporter of Donald Trump might reply. And maybe that's true! There's also no evidence that it is, mind you, and there are all kinds of reasons to believe that it's not -- starting with basic logic.\par \par \uc2 But if you're a presidential candidate trying to bail out a ship that keeps sprouting holes, that might offer at least a bit of hope -- or motivation.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020150709eb79000dy\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 the-fix\par {\*\bkmkstart toc79}{\*\bkmkend toc79}\b \uc2 6 big things to know about sanctuary cities \b0\par\par\uc2 By Janell Ross   \par \uc2 1,240 \uc2 words\par \uc2 9 July 2015\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2015, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Illegal immigration is one of those topics on which almost everyone has an opinion -- maybe several opinions. But when it comes to the facts, the number of people with a grasp on them is a lot smaller.\par \par \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 , a contender for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination, said last month that illegal immigrants coming across the U.S.-Mexico border are in large part "rapists" and "murderers." And in San Francisco, the shooting death of Kathryn Steinle, 31, allegedly caused by man who has been deported multiple times and convicted of a series of very serious crimes, has set off a new wave of concern about immigration and so-called "sanctuary cities" like San Francisco.\par \par \uc2 It's a lot. That's why there is a Part I and a Part II to this post. But we've tried to boil it down to the essentials for your next immigration-related debate.\par \par \uc2 If a person is in the United States illegally, why isn't\u160\'00\'A0he or she\u160\'00\'A0arrested and shipped back to his or her home country immediately?\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 This is one of those places where the country's commitment to freedom and liberty get a real road test.\par \par \uc2 As mentioned above, immigration is often complicated. At least some portion of the people who do enter the country illegally or overstay the terms of their\u160\'00\'A0visitor or student visas also have legitimate asylum claims. Asylum is limited to individuals who can provide evidence that they have faced persecution or might\u160\'00\'A0be killed if they return to their\u160\'00\'A0home country. And U.S. law says that most people caught inside the United States should be given a chance to make those claims in an immigration court. (For more information on asylum seekers, see Tables 16 and 17 here).\par \par \uc2 Now, layer on top of that more than 445,000 people awaiting immigration hearings. Most of these people cannot make a successful asylum claim but might\u160\'00\'A0have some other legal defense such as proof of a U.S. citizen parent or grandparent.\par \par \uc2 Unauthorized immigrants caught inside the United States -- or in some cases at the border -- generally get a hearing in one of the nation's deeply backlogged immigration courts. Wait times now stretch into 2019.\par \par \uc2 That means that federal immigration authorities also have to make decisions about whom to hold during that wait and whom to release and trust to show up again.\par \par \uc2 How many people does the United States deport each\u160\'00\'A0year?\par \par \uc2 The data reporting here lags a bit behind and, of course, varies from year to year. But on average, between 2011 and 2013, immigration courts ordered about 414,650 people out in one way or another. Here's the picture painted in the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2 's most recent annual immigration data report, for 2013.\par \par \uc2 What is a "sanctuary city," anyway?\par \par \uc2 The policies and practices differ in the estimated 60 sanctuary cities around the country. That list includes major cities such as New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Houston. But generally, when someone has been, for instance, arrested for driving without a license and then identified as an \uc2 illegal\u160\'00\'A0immigrant\uc2  at a jail in a sanctuary city, they must serve jail time for state charges or pay related fines. Then, they are let go.\par \par \uc2 Most of these cities have identified some set of guidelines or conditions under which federal immigration officials must be alerted before the person's release. Usually they are connected to what's on the person's rap sheet.\par \par \uc2 But some either don't have them or don't follow them. For a deeper look at the role that San Francisco's sanctuary-city\u160\'00\'A0status has played in the immigration\u160\'00\'A0debate since the\u160\'00\'A0Steinle shooting, see this.\par \par \uc2 [California killing inflames debate on illegal imigrants, 'sanctuary cities.']\par \par \uc2 Once an undocumented\u160\'00\'A0immigrant has been arrested for committing a crime inside the United States, why do sanctuary cities\u160\'00\'A0let them go?\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 During the apex of the country's illegal immigration challenges, before the recession, law enforcement officials in some communities expressed concern about the practice of releasing these inmates after they had served time for state offenses. Some of those communities entered agreements to help federal authorities with immigration enforcement. This went on between 2004 and 2012.\par \par \uc2 These agreements allowed local jails to house undocumented immigrants after they had served time on state charges and bill the federal government for this service. Sometimes inmates were passed along to jails in other places without any formal notice to family members, then into the immigration court system for an expedited removal hearing. In many cases, people were returned to their\u160\'00\'A0home countries in weeks.\par \par \uc2 That program was widely criticized as a possible revenue stream for some local jails\u160\'00\'A0and a potential\u160\'00\'A0violation of international human rights accords. Some people were unable to communicate with embassy officials from their\u160\'00\'A0countries of origin or notify family members of their\u160\'00\'A0arrests, basically disappearing\u160\'00\'A0without explanation. Civil liberties groups\u160\'00\'A0called it a vehicle for racial and ethnic profiling. One Tennessee sheriff described it as part of his toolkit to "stack these violators like cordwood." In addition, more than one analysis of who was deported and what happened during that process\u160\'00\'A0showed that most were people initially arrested for minor traffic violations and who had no criminal record.\par \par \uc2 President Obama touted the fact that his administration had deported the largest number of people in U.S. history. (Read the more complicated truth here.) Meanwhile, immigrant advocates said all of this deeply damaged already-limited police trust in immigrant communities, making people afraid to call police or provide information. That, these advocates argued, was the real threat to public safety.\par \par \uc2 This is where sanctuary cities come in.\par \par \uc2 What happens in other cities?\par \par \uc2 After a series of changes, new programs and memos from the top that were supposed to assure that more of the nation's deportation\u160\'00\'A0apparatus got aimed at serious and violent criminals, the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2  is now asking communities to participate in a different program, this time called Priority Enforcement.\par \par \uc2 Priority Enforcement won't formally begin until later this summer, The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2  reported Tuesday. When it does, it will ask local law enforcement agencies to\u160\'00\'A0notify federal immigration authorities before the scheduled release of an immigrant targeted for deportation. Those targeted for deportation include people with violent and serious crime convictions. And federal officials told The Post that they did make just such a request to the folks in San Francisco.\par \par \uc2 Finally, is there any evidence that those who enter the country illegally commit more crime than others?\par \par \uc2 The Fix looked at this issue this week and found an answer that shouldn't really be surprising.\par \par \uc2 Like every population, there are some people who have immigrated to the United States illegally who go on to commit serious and misdemeanor\u160\'00\'A0crimes in this country. But immigrants of all kinds are actually less likely to commit crimes than those born inside the United States. (For more detail check out this post immediately.) Here's the big take away in one chart.\par \par \uc2 This chart highlights all immigrants, but it's important to note that more than one-quarter of all immigrants currently in the United States are undocumented. So a spike in their crime rate would likely mean the "first generation" line wouldn't be so low.\par \par \uc2 OK. We hope that helps.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020150708eb78002xr\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The case of a killing on San Francisco's Pier 14 last week has turned into a national debate about the merit's of the city's sanctuary city policy. But the criminal case against the man accused of shooting 32-year old Kate\u160\'00\'A0Steinle took an unexpected turn Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 The weapon used in the shooting belonged to a federal agent, according to the Associated Press and the \uc2 Los Angeles Times\uc2  , who cited a law enforcement official who was not authorized to speak publicly about the case.\par \par \uc2 The seemingly random act of violence became a national story after police arrested and charged 45-year-old Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez with murder in Steinle's death. Lopez-Sanchez, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , had a long history of felony convictions and had been deported five times to Mexico.\par \par \uc2 Most recently he was in federal custody serving time for illegally entering the United States when he was released to the custody of San Francisco authorities in March on drug charges that were later dropped. Federal immigration officials blamed local authorities for ignoring a request to notify them before Lopez-Sanchez was released, which they said could have prevented Steinle's death.\par \par \uc2 San Francisco is a "sanctuary city" that generally does not voluntarily cooperate or communicate with immigration officials on matters of enforcement.\par \par \uc2 [Is San Francisco's 'sanctuary city' policy to blame for a woman's death?]\par \par \uc2 In jailhouse interviews with local stations, Lopez-Sanchez said that he found the gun wrapped in a T-shirt on the pier when it fired. He told local station KGO that he didn't realize that someone had been shot.\par \par \uc2 The San Francisco Chronicle reported that the gun had been stolen from a federal agent in June.\par \par \uc2 Lopez-Sanchez pleaded not guilty to the charges in court\u160\'00\'A0 Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 A public defender assigned as his attorney said his client has a second-grade education, according to the San Francisco Chronicle.\par \par \uc2 "This very well could be a completely accidental discharge of a firearm," said attorney Matt Gonzalez. "You've got an individual who does not know the victim in the case, has no interest or desire in injuring her in any way, and no witness or anybody to allege that there was any crime going on at the time the shooting occurred."\par \par \uc2 The case has drawn reactions from local and national figures alike. Tuesday, Democratic presidential candidate \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  said San Francisco "made a mistake" in not cooperating with immigration authorities in this case.\par \par \uc2 [6 big things to know about sanctuary cities and illegal immigration]\par \par \uc2 "Well, what should be done is any city should listen to the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2  , which as I understand it, urged them to deport this man again after he got out of prison another time," Clinton said. "The city made a mistake, not to deport someone that the federal government strongly felt should be deported."\par \par \uc2 "So I have absolutely no support for a city that ignores the strong evidence that should be acted on," she added.\par \par \uc2 San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee defended the city's "sanctuary city" policies but called on federal officials to investigate what went wrong in this case.\par \par \uc2 "I am concerned about the circumstances that led to the release of Mr. Sanchez," Lee said in a statement Monday. "All agencies involved, federal and local, need to conduct quick, thorough and objective reviews of their own departmental policies and the decisions they made in this case."\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020150708eb78003xr\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The criminal case against an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  accused of fatally shooting a woman on a San Francisco pier took a new turn Wednesday, as reports emerged suggesting that the gun used to fire the deadly shot may have been stolen from a federal law enforcement agent four days earlier.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 federal Bureau of Land Management\uc2  said Wednesday that a weapon belonging to one of its law enforcement officers was stolen on June 27 in San Francisco, but the agency would not confirm that the weapon was used in the apparently random shooting that occurred July 1, resulting in the death of woman out for a walk with her father.\par \par \uc2 A\u160\'00\'A0law enforcement official said separately that the gun in that case belonged to a federal law enforcement agent.\par \par \uc2 The man charged with the shooting,\u160\'00\'A045-year-old Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, said in interviews with local media that he found the gun wrapped in a T-shirt.\par \par \uc2 The case has ignited a\u160\'00\'A0national debate about the merits of San Francisco's "sanctuary" policy, in which law enforcement officers routinely do not cooperate with federal immigration enforcement actions. Lopez-Sanchez, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , had a long history of felony convictions and had been deported to Mexico five times.\par \par \uc2 The weapon used to kill 32-year-old Kate Steinle was a .40 caliber pistol, according to a law enforcement official who was not authorized to speak publicly about the case. A single bullet had been fired from the gun.\par \par \uc2 Dana Wilson, a spokeswoman with BLM, said\u160\'00\'A0the agent was en route to an official travel assignment when the agency-issued weapon was stolen from his vehicle. The theft was reported to the San Francisco Police Department.\par \par \uc2 San Francisco is a "sanctuary city" that generally does not voluntarily cooperate or communicate with immigration officials on matters of enforcement.\par \par \uc2 Most recently, Lopez-Sanchez was in federal custody serving time for illegally entering the United States when he was released to the custody of San Francisco authorities in March on drug charges that were later dropped. Federal immigration officials blamed local authorities for ignoring a request to notify them before Lopez-Sanchez was released, which they said could have prevented Steinle's death.\par \par \uc2 [Is San Francisco's 'sanctuary city' policy to blame for a woman's death?]\par \par \uc2 In jailhouse interviews with local stations, Lopez-Sanchez said he found the gun wrapped in a T-shirt on the pier and that it went off. He told local station KGO that he didn't realize someone had been shot.\u160\'00\'A0Steinle was walking along Pier 14 with her father when she was struck by the bullet.\par \par \uc2 The San Francisco Chronicle reported that the gun was stolen from a federal agent in June.\par \par \uc2 Lopez-Sanchez pleaded not guilty to the charges in court Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 A public defender assigned as his attorney said his client has a second-grade education, according to the San Francisco Chronicle.\par \par \uc2 "This very well could be a completely accidental discharge of a firearm," said attorney Matt Gonzalez. "You've got an individual who does not know the victim in the case, has no interest or desire in injuring her in any way, and no witness or anybody to allege that there was any crime going on at the time the shooting occurred."\par \par \uc2 The case has drawn reactions from local and national figures alike. Tuesday, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton said San Francisco "made a mistake" in not cooperating with immigration authorities in the case.\par \par \uc2 [6 big things to know about sanctuary cities and illegal immigration]\par \par \uc2 "Well, what should be done is any city should listen to the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2 , which as I understand it, urged them to deport this man again after he got out of prison another time," Clinton said. "The city made a mistake, not to deport someone that the federal government strongly felt should be deported."\par \par \uc2 "So I have absolutely no support for a city that ignores the strong evidence that should be acted on," she added.\par \par \uc2 San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee defended the city's "sanctuary city" policies but called on federal officials to investigate what went wrong in this case.\par \par \uc2 "I am concerned about the circumstances that led to the release of Mr. Sanchez," Lee said in a statement Monday. "All agencies involved, federal and local, need to conduct quick, thorough and objective reviews of their own departmental policies and the decisions they made in this case."\par \par \uc2 [This post has been updated.]\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020150708eb78005k7\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 A balancing act. "Insisting that it was staying out of Mideast politics and that it was not shutting Congress out of foreign policymaking,\u160\'00\'A0a divided Supreme Court on Monday struck down a thirteen-year-old law allowing Americans born in the bitterly contested city of Jerusalem to claim that they were born in Israel. . . . Even as the ruling nullified an important exercise of Congress's legislative powers, the Kennedy opinion appeared to have gone out of its way, otherwise, to acknowledge significant congressional authority in the foreign policy field, and even over passport policy as a part of its authority to regulate citizenship and its general power to pass specific laws to carry out its broad grants of legislation power."\par \par \uc2 Even this won't mollify the anti-immigration zealots. "Illegal immigration across the southwestern border is on pace for the lowest year since 1972, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said Monday, claiming success a year after the surge of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  children and families exposed major holes in U.S. policy."\par \par \uc2 Opinion is split, but not contradictory. "Public support for Obamacare tied its all-time low in the latest ABC News/Washington Post poll \u8212\'20\'14 even as most Americans say the Supreme Court should not block federal subsidies at the heart of the health care law.\u160\'00\'A0With the high court set to rule on the latest challenge to the ACA, the poll reflects the public's split views of the law \u8212\'20\'14 criticism of its insurance mandate, yet support for extended coverage." Voters may want a legislative fix.\par \par \uc2 A young, dynamic Hispanic campaign manager may counterbalance the image he's a candidate of the past. "Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush is naming Danny Diaz as campaign manager for his anticipated White House bid. . . .\u160\'00\'A0Diaz, 39, has worked for the past three GOP presidential nominees, most recently serving as senior adviser to former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney 's 2012 presidential campaign. He is the founding partner at FP1 Strategies LLC, a public affairs and media group in Washington, D.C., focused on strategic planning and advertising for political campaigns.\u160\'00\'A0Diaz's selection was a surprise; many expected David Kochel, an Iowa GOP operative who moved to Miami, to fill the role."\par \par \uc2 The difference is now there are counterweights like the Free Beacon to expose it. "Tapper Hits NY Times for 'Acting Like a Campaign.'"\par \par \uc2 As Republicans draw level with \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 , some wonder if her lead was a mirage. "Through all of \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 's recent troubles \u8212\'20\'14 emails, foundation, Benghazi \u8212\'20\'14 Democrats have taken comfort in their all-but-assured nominee's formidable lead over top Republicans in head-to-head matchups. Now that lead is shrinking, and the Democratic comfort level is falling along with it.\u160\'00\'A0But it's possible Clinton's big lead was never as big as Democrats thought." Actually this is Clinton's\u160\'00\'A0fundamental problem \u8212\'20\'14 the more people see the less they like her.\par \par \uc2 Showing he is equal to the task of being commander in chief right now. "Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush will meet with Poland's newly elected president on Thursday in Warsaw.\u160\'00\'A0Andrzej Duda, who won a Tea Party-like victory against the Polish establishment last month, will have an informal meeting in the afternoon with Bush, said Krzysztof Szczerski, a Duda adviser.\u160\'00\'A0Bush, who represents the Republican establishment in the wide-open race for the party's U.S. presidential nomination, begins a five-day tour through Europe on Tuesday in Berlin. He's scheduled to deliver remarks and take questions at an economic conference hosted by German Chancellor Angel Merkel's political party."\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020150609eb6900336\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Even as evidence mounts that illegal immigration flows have fallen to their lowest level in years, the union that represents border patrol officers is saying the government could be doing much better at stopping people who still try to cross the U.S. southwest border.\par \par \uc2 In a series of recent interviews, union officials described a difficult, often perilous job in which they are struggling at times to keep up with migrants seeking to outwit the government's heightened security measures. They said morale among agents has plunged, partly because of the executive actions shielding millions of illegal immigrants from deportation that President Obama announced last year.\par \par \uc2 "We know there is a lot of traffic still getting through the border," said Shawn Moran, vice president of the National Border Patrol Council, which represents more than 16,000 agents. Moran, a 17-year agent based in San Diego, and other union officials criticized \uc2 U.S. Customs and Border Protection\uc2  \u8212\'20\'14 which includes the border patrol \u8212\'20\'14 as inefficient and top-heavy with supervisors.\par \par \uc2 R. Gil Kerlikowske, commissioner of \uc2 U.S. Customs and Border Protection\uc2 , praised the dedication of border patrol agents and said "in many ways, I get their issues and frustrations." But after the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2 's more than decade-long crackdown on southwest border security, he said, the agents have plenty of staff and technology to do their jobs.\par \par \uc2 "If some of these folks are so unhappy, they really need to reassess what they do and where they are," Kerlikowske said. Customs and border protection is part of \uc2 DHS\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The debate comes as a number of indicators show that immigration flows are falling, especially from Mexico. Researchers say far fewer Mexicans are planning to cross the border than in years past, and the overall U.S. \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  population \u8212\'20\'14 which more than tripled, to 12.2 million, between 1990 and 2007 \u8212\'20\'14 has dropped by about 1 million, according to demographers at the \uc2 Pew Research Center\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 [Fewer immigrants are entering the U.S. illegally, and that's changed the border security debate]\par \par \uc2 Homeland security officials point to measures they have taken since the George W. Bush administration, including more than doubling the border patrol's size and spending billions on new technology, as driving the trends. "Put simply, it's now much harder to cross our border and evade capture than it used to be \u8212\'20\'14 and people know that," said DHS secretary \uc2 Jeh Johnson\uc2  said in an October speech. He has repeatedly spoken publicly about the importance of border security.\par \par \uc2 Some experts agree, while others instead point to changes in Latin America, such as the improving Mexican economy. Border security is critical to the debate over immigration reform in Washington, with congressional Republicans saying the southwest frontier must be more secure before they will consider legalizing illegal immigrants already in the United States.\par \par \uc2 Among the key indicators cited by \uc2 DHS\uc2  is the rapid decline in apprehensions at the border. Since 2000, when more than 1.6 million border crossers were stopped, those numbers have plunged to around 400,000 per year, and they are down 28 percent in the first part of fiscal 2015 compared with last year.\par \par \uc2 But union officials say those figures don't mean much because they don't chart people who successfully make it into the United States."This notion that \uc2 DHS\uc2  is saying the border is more secure than ever \u8212\'20\'14 they don't have any evidence of that," said Brandon Judd, the union's president and a 17-year agent based in Maine."It's just smoke and mirrors."\par \par \uc2 Chris Cabrera, a 13-year agent based in Texas and a union official, said Obama's executive actions have sent mixed messages to the agents in the field. Those actions have faced resistance in the courts, including the decision Tuesday by a federal appeals court to keep one of the president's signature immigration efforts from moving ahead.\par \par \uc2 "Border crossings are usually tied with perceived amnesty," Cabrera said. "If people believe they will get some type of relief or a free ride, the floodgates open."\par \par \uc2 Kerlikowske suggested that his agents focus on law enforcement, rather than politics. "You don't get to control certain things'' he said. "I'm not the judge, jury and executioner and commissioner, and certainly at their level in the border patrol, they're not either."\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020150529eb5t0030d\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved   \par \par \uc2 Even as evidence mounts that illegal immigration flows have fallen to their lowest level in years, the union that represents border patrol officers is saying the government could be doing much better at stopping people who try to cross the U.S. Southwest border.\par \par \uc2 In a series of recent interviews, union officials described a difficult, often perilous job in which agents sometimes struggle to keep up with migrants seeking to outwit the government's heightened security measures. They said morale among agents has plunged, partly because of the executive actions shielding millions of illegal immigrants from deportation that President Obama announced last year.\par \par \uc2 "We know there is a lot of traffic still getting through the border,'' said Shawn Moran, vice president of the National Border Patrol Council, which represents more than 16,000 agents. Moran, a 17-year agent based in San Diego, and other union officials criticized \uc2 U.S. Customs and Border Protection\uc2  - which includes the Border Patrol - as inefficient and top-heavy with supervisors.\par \par \uc2 R. Gil Kerlikowske, commissioner of \uc2 U.S. Customs and Border Protection\uc2 , praised the dedication of Border Patrol agents and said that "in many ways, I get their issues and frustrations.'' But after the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2 's more than decade-long crackdown on Southwest border security, he said, the agents have plenty of staff and technology to do their jobs.\par \par \uc2 "If some of these folks are so unhappy, they really need to reassess what they do and where they are,'' he said. Customs and Border Protection is part of the \uc2 DHS\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The debate comes as a number of indicators show that immigration flows are falling, especially from Mexico. Researchers say that far fewer Mexicans are planning to cross the border than in years past, and the overall U.S. \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  population - which more than tripled, to 12.2 million, from 1990 to 2007 - has dropped by about 1 million, according to demographers at the \uc2 Pew Research Center\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Homeland Security\uc2  officials point to measures they have taken since the George W. Bush administration, including more than doubling the Border Patrol's size and spending billions of dollars on new technology, as driving the trends. "Put simply, it's now much harder to cross our border and evade capture than it used to be - and people know that,'' DHS Secretary \uc2 Jeh Johnson\uc2  said in an October speech. He has repeatedly spoken about the importance of border security.\par \par \uc2 Some experts agree, while others instead point to changes in Latin America, such as the improving Mexican economy. Border security is critical to the debate over immigration policy in Washington, with congressional Republicans saying the Southwest frontier must be more secure before they will consider legalizing the illegal immigrants already in the United States.\par \par \uc2 Among the key indicators cited by the \uc2 DHS\uc2  is the rapid decline in apprehensions at the border. Since 2000, when more than 1.6 million border crossers were stopped, those numbers have dropped to about 400,000 per year, and they've fallen 28 percent in the first part of fiscal 2015 compared with last year.\par \par \uc2 But union officials say those figures don't mean much because they don't chart the people who successfully make it into the United States. "This notion that \uc2 DHS\uc2  is saying the border is more secure than ever - they don't have any evidence of that,'' said Brandon Judd, the union's president and a 17-year agent based in Maine."It's just smoke and mirrors.''\par \par \uc2 Chris Cabrera, a 13-year agent based in Texas and a union official, said Obama's executive actions have sent mixed messages to the agents in the field. Those actions have faced resistance in the courts, including the decision Tuesday by a federal appeals court to keep one of the president's signature immigration efforts from moving ahead.\par \par \uc2 "Border crossings are usually tied with perceived amnesty,'' Cabrera said. "If people believe they will get some type of relief or a free ride, the floodgates open.''\par \par \uc2 Kerlikowske suggested that his agents focus on law enforcement rather than politics. "You don't get to control certain things,'' he said. "I'm not the judge, jury and executioner and commissioner, and certainly at their level in the Border Patrol, they're not either.''\par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com\par \par \uc2 WP20150529DHS0529\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020150529eb5t00040\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Monica Camacho-Perez came to the United States from Mexico as a child, crossing into Arizona with her mother in the same spot where her father made the trip before them. "Nobody stopped us,'' Camacho-Perez, now 20, said of her 2002 journey.\par \par \uc2 Three years ago, her uncle tried to cross the border and join the family in Baltimore, where they remain illegal immigrants. He was stopped three times by the U.S. Border Patrol and jailed for 50\u160\'00\'A0days.\par \par \uc2 "He doesn't want to try anymore," said Camacho-Perez. "Now, it's really hard."\par \par \uc2 As the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2  continues to pour money into border security, evidence is emerging that illegal immigration flows have fallen to their lowest level in at least two decades. The nation's population of illegal immigrants, which more than tripled, to 12.2\u160\'00\'A0million, between 1990 and 2007, has dropped by about 1\u160\'00\'A0million, according to demographers at the \uc2 Pew Research Center\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 A key \u8212\'20\'14 but largely overlooked \u8212\'20\'14 sign of these ebbing flows is the changing makeup of the undocumented population. Until recent years, illegal immigrants tended to be young men streaming across the Southern border in pursuit of work. But demographic data show that the typical \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  now is much more likely someone who is 35 or older and has lived in the United States for a decade or more.\par \par \uc2 Homeland security officials in the Obama and George W. Bush administrations \u8212\'20\'14 who have more than doubled the Border Patrol's size and spent billions on drones, sensors and other technology at the border \u8212\'20\'14 say enhanced security is driving the new trends.\par \par \uc2 "We have seen tremendous progress," said R. Gil Kerlikowske, commissioner of \uc2 U.S. Customs and Border Protection\uc2 , which is part of the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2 . "The border is much more secure than in times past."\par \par \uc2 The issue of border security is central to the broader debate over immigration reform that has roiled Washington in recent years and is emerging as a flash point in the 2016 presidential campaign. Congressional Republicans have insisted on greater border security before they consider legalizing any immigrants who came to this country without proper documents.\par \par \uc2 President Obama says the border has never been more secure and is urging a series of legislative steps to legalize millions of undocumented immigrants, streamline the visa system and further fortify the border. He has already moved to protect certain undocumented immigrants from deportation through executive actions. But these actions have faced resistance in the courts, including the decision Tuesday by a federal appeals court to keep one of the president's signature immigration efforts from moving ahead.\par \par \uc2 What's increasingly clear is that the shifting fortunes of the U.S. economy account for less of the ebb and flow of illegal immigration. Even as the economy bounces back from recession, illegal immigration flows, especially from Mexico, have kept declining, \u173\'00\'ADaccording to researchers and government data. Since the 1990s, the opposite was true: The better the economy, the more people tried to come.\par \par \uc2 "Every month or quarter that the economy continues to improve and unauthorized immigration doesn't pick up supports the theory that border security is a bigger factor, and it's less about the economy and we have moved into a new era,'' said \uc2 Marc Rosenblum\uc2 , deputy director of the U.S. immigration program at the \uc2 Migration Policy Institute\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Some researchers say factors other than security are playing a role and might even account for much of the reduced flow of illegal immigrants. These researchers point, for instance, to changes in Latin America that could be pushing fewer people to seek a better life in the United States.\par \par \uc2 At odds with the government's claims of success, a series of academic studies in recent years have found little linkage between border security and illegal migration.\par \par \uc2 Douglas S. Massey, a \uc2 Princeton University\uc2  sociologist, said the falling numbers of immigrants have "nothing to do with border enforcement." Massey, who helps run a project that has interviewed thousands of illegal Mexican migrants over the past three decades, attributed the trend to demographic changes in Mexico, such as women having fewer children.\par \par \uc2 But even some researchers who are skeptical about the overall effectiveness of enhanced border security acknowledge indirect effects of these measures. For potential migrants who are calculating the pros and cons of trying to cross the border, stiffer U.S. security measures are making the trip much more expensive, in particular the exploding cost of hiring a guide. The journey has also become more arduous and dangerous, in part because the \uc2 DHS\uc2  has plugged traditional crossing points and driven migrants deeper into the desert.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18More difficult and expensive\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 Since the Bush administration, the \uc2 DHS\uc2  has dramatically increased its efforts to lock down the southwest border. The budget for Customs and Border Protection has grown to $10.7\u160\'00\'A0billion in the past decade, a 75\u160\'00\'A0percent increase. The number of Border Patrol agents at the border has nearly doubled over the past decade, to more than 18,000 today.\par \par \uc2 Much of the ramp-up occurred during the Bush administration, but the Obama administration has marshaled more forces as well. Homeland Security Secretary \uc2 Jeh Johnson\uc2  has recently set up three task forces to increase coordination within the \uc2 DHS\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Current and former \uc2 DHS\uc2  officials acknowledge that a confluence of factors explains the decline in illegal migration, including demographic changes in Mexico, improvements in its economy and Mexico's crackdown on Central American migrants headed to the United States. But these officials insist that the massive investment to secure the border has been the key factor.\par \par \uc2 "It used to be that you could literally sit at a bar in Tijuana, Mexico, look across the border into San Diego, wait for the Border Patrol to drive in the other direction and make a run for it,'' said \uc2 Steve Atkiss\uc2 , a former CBP chief of staff and now a partner at \uc2 Command Consulting Group\uc2 . "It's much more difficult and expensive now."\par \par \uc2 Madai Ledezma crossed the Mexican border into Texas a decade ago at age 23 and remains in the United States as an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . She said her uncle and brother had recently wanted to join her. But, she said, they're staying put after her uncle was caught by the Border Patrol a year ago and locked up for a month before being sent back to Mexico.\par \par \uc2 "The risk of crossing again is that he will be locked up again,'' Ledezma said. She added, "I just heard recently that the Border Patrol now has the ability to fire their weapons."\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18Aging in place\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 Ledezma's uncle was one of a shrinking number of undocumented immigrants stopped by the Border Patrol. Government officials widely cite that trend as evidence that the overall flow is also down.\par \par \uc2 In 2000, considered the peak of the flood of illegal Mexican migration, more than 1.6\u160\'00\'A0million people were apprehended, according to \uc2 DHS\uc2  data. Those numbers have plunged to around 400,000 per year since 2012 and are down 28\u160\'00\'A0percent in the first part of fiscal 2015 compared with last year. Even last year's widely publicized spike in unaccompanied minors crossing the border from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras has receded dramatically, the data show.\par \par \uc2 While the declining number of apprehensions is not conclusive proof that illegal immigration is down, other less publicized research strongly suggests this is the case.\par \par \uc2 Wayne Cornelius, director of the Mexican migration field research program at the \uc2 University of California at San Diego\uc2 , interviews hundreds of people each year in the Mexican state of Yuca\u173\'00\'ADtan and asks them whether they are planning to come to the United States in the next 12\u160\'00\'A0months.\par \par \uc2 In 2006, 24\u160\'00\'A0percent said yes. By 2009, as the U.S. economy was cratering, 8\u160\'00\'A0percent said yes. This year, 2.5\u160\'00\'A0percent answered in the affirmative.\par \par \uc2 A recent study by the \uc2 Pew Research Center\uc2 , meanwhile, found that the median length of stay for illegal immigrants in the United States jumped from less than eight years in 2003 to nearly 13 years by 2013. Their median age has increased from 28 during the 1990s to nearly 36 today.\par \par \uc2 Those figures wouldn't be possible if young men were still coming across the border in huge numbers, and it was those young men who accounted for most of the illegal traffic.\par \par \uc2 But Massey, the Princeton researcher, highlighted an unintended consequence of the security crackdown on the border. He said immigrants who are already in the United States are afraid to go back and forth to Mexico as they traditionally did, and are "aging in place" in the United States.\par \par \uc2 Ledezma's tale is a common one. Over the past decade, she and her husband, Jose Pina, a landscaper, have become involved in their community in New Carrollton. Their daughter, Heather, 6, is a U.S. citizen. Ledezma volunteers at Heather's school, reads with her at the public library and attends a local church.\par \par \uc2 "After so many years of living here, I of course consider this my home," she said.\par \par \uc2 According to estimates by the \uc2 Migration Policy Institute\uc2 , about a third of illegal immigrants own a home and have children who are U.S. citizens.\par \par \uc2 "We have this population here and they haven't left and they don't appear to be going back and forth to Mexico anymore,'' said George Escobar, senior director of human services for CASA, a \u173\'00\'ADMaryland-based immigrant advocacy group. "These trends have reshaped the immigration debate right before our eyes."\par \par \uc2 jerry.markon@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020150528eb5s0002x\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved   \par \par \uc2 Monica Camacho-Perez came to the United States from Mexico as a child, crossing into Arizona with her mother in the same spot where her father made the trip before them. "Nobody stopped us,'' Camacho-Perez, now 20, said of her 2002 journey.\par \par \uc2 Three years ago, her uncle tried to cross the border and join the family in Baltimore, where they remain illegal immigrants. He was stopped three times by the U.S. Border Patrol and jailed for 50 days.\par \par \uc2 "He doesn't want to try anymore," said Camacho-Perez. "Now, it's really hard."\par \par \uc2 As the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2  continues to pour money into border security, evidence is emerging that illegal immigration flows have fallen to their lowest level in at least two decades. The nation's population of illegal immigrants, which more than tripled, to 12.2 million, between 1990 and 2007, has dropped by about 1 million, according to demographers at the \uc2 Pew Research Center\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 A key - but largely overlooked - sign of these ebbing flows is the changing makeup of the undocumented population. Until recent years, illegal immigrants tended to be young men streaming across the Southern border in pursuit of work. But demographic data show that the typical \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  now is much more likely someone who is 35 or older and has lived in the United States for a decade or more.\par \par \uc2 Homeland security officials in the Obama and George W. Bush administrations - who have more than doubled the Border Patrol's size and spent billions on drones, sensors and other technology at the border - say enhanced security is driving the new trends.\par \par \uc2 "We have seen tremendous progress," said R. Gil Kerlikowske, commissioner of \uc2 U.S. Customs and Border Protection\uc2 , which is part of the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2 . "The border is much more secure than in times past."\par \par \uc2 The issue of border security is central to the broader debate over immigration reform that has roiled Washington in recent years and is emerging as a flash point in the 2016 presidential campaign. Congressional Republicans have insisted on greater border security before they consider legalizing any immigrants who came to this country without proper documents.\par \par \uc2 President Obama says the border has never been more secure and is urging a series of legislative steps to legalize millions of undocumented immigrants, streamline the visa system and further fortify the border. He has already moved to protect certain undocumented immigrants from deportation through executive actions. But these actions have faced resistance in the courts, including the decision Tuesday by a federal appeals court to keep one of the president's signature immigration efforts from moving ahead.\par \par \uc2 What's increasingly clear is that the shifting fortunes of the U.S. economy account for less of the ebb and flow of illegal immigration. Even as the economy bounces back from recession, illegal immigration flows, especially from Mexico, have kept declining, according to researchers and government data. Since the 1990s, the opposite was true: The better the economy, the more people tried to come.\par \par \uc2 "Every month or quarter that the economy continues to improve and unauthorized immigration doesn't pick up supports the theory that border security is a bigger factor, and it's less about the economy and we have moved into a new era,'' said \uc2 Marc Rosenblum\uc2 , deputy director of the U.S. immigration program at the \uc2 Migration Policy Institute\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Some researchers say factors other than security are playing a role and might even account for much of the reduced flow of illegal immigrants. These researchers point, for instance, to changes in Latin America that could be pushing fewer people to seek a better life in the United States.\par \par \uc2 At odds with the government's claims of success, a series of academic studies in recent years have found little linkage between border security and illegal migration.\par \par \uc2 Douglas S. Massey, a \uc2 Princeton University\uc2  sociologist, said the falling numbers of immigrants have "nothing to do with border enforcement." Massey, who helps run a project that has interviewed thousands of illegal Mexican migrants over the past three decades, attributed the trend to demographic changes in Mexico, such as women having fewer children.\par \par \uc2 But even some researchers who are skeptical about the overall effectiveness of enhanced border security acknowledge indirect effects of these measures. For potential migrants who are calculating the pros and cons of trying to cross the border, stiffer U.S. security measures are making the trip much more expensive, in particular the exploding cost of hiring a guide. The journey has also become more arduous and dangerous, in part because the \uc2 DHS\uc2  has plugged traditional crossing points and driven migrants deeper into the desert.\par \par \uc2 Since the Bush administration, the \uc2 DHS\uc2  has dramatically increased its efforts to lock down the southwest border. The budget for Customs and Border Protection has grown to $10.7 billion in the past decade, a 75 percent increase. The number of Border Patrol agents at the border has nearly doubled over the past decade, to more than 18,000 today.\par \par \uc2 Much of the ramp-up occurred during the Bush administration, but the Obama administration has marshaled more forces as well. Homeland Security Secretary \uc2 Jeh Johnson\uc2  has recently set up three task forces to increase coordination within the \uc2 DHS\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Current and former \uc2 DHS\uc2  officials acknowledge that a confluence of factors explains the decline in illegal migration, including demographic changes in Mexico, improvements in its economy and Mexico's crackdown on Central American migrants headed to the United States. But these officials insist that the massive investment to secure the border has been the key factor.\par \par \uc2 "It used to be that you could literally sit at a bar in Tijuana, Mexico, look across the border into San Diego, wait for the Border Patrol to drive in the other direction and make a run for it,'' said \uc2 Steve Atkiss\uc2 , a former CBP chief of staff and now a partner at \uc2 Command Consulting Group\uc2 . "It's much more difficult and expensive now."\par \par \uc2 Madai Ledezma crossed the Mexican border into Texas a decade ago at age 23 and remains in the United States as an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . She said her uncle and brother had recently wanted to join her. But, she said, they're staying put after her uncle was caught by the Border Patrol a year ago and locked up for a month before being sent back to Mexico.\par \par \uc2 "The risk of crossing again is that he will be locked up again,'' Ledezma said. She added, "I just heard recently that the Border Patrol now has the ability to fire their weapons."\par \par \uc2 Ledezma's uncle was one of a shrinking number of undocumented immigrants stopped by the Border Patrol. Government officials widely cite that trend as evidence that the overall flow is also down.\par \par \uc2 In 2000, considered the peak of the flood of illegal Mexican migration, more than 1.6 million people were apprehended, according to \uc2 DHS\uc2  data. Those numbers have plunged to around 400,000 per year since 2012 and are down 28 percent in the first part of fiscal 2015 compared with last year. Even last year's widely publicized spike in unaccompanied minors crossing the border from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras has receded dramatically, the data show.\par \par \uc2 While the declining number of apprehensions is not conclusive proof that illegal immigration is down, other less publicized research strongly suggests this is the case.\par \par \uc2 Wayne Cornelius, director of the Mexican migration field research program at the \uc2 University of California at San Diego\uc2 , interviews hundreds of people each year in the Mexican state of Yucatan and asks them whether they are planning to come to the United States in the next 12 months.\par \par \uc2 In 2006, 24 percent said yes. By 2009, as the U.S. economy was cratering, 8 percent said yes. This year, 2.5 percent answered in the affirmative.\par \par \uc2 A recent study by the \uc2 Pew Research Center\uc2 , meanwhile, found that the median length of stay for illegal immigrants in the United States jumped from less than eight years in 2003 to nearly 13 years by 2013. Their median age has increased from 28 during the 1990s to nearly 36 today.\par \par \uc2 Those figures wouldn't be possible if young men were still coming across the border in huge numbers, and it was those young men who accounted for most of the illegal traffic.\par \par \uc2 But Massey, the Princeton researcher, highlighted an unintended consequence of the security crackdown on the border. He said immigrants who are already in the United States are afraid to go back and forth to Mexico as they traditionally did, and are "aging in place" in the United States.\par \par \uc2 Ledezma's tale is a common one. Over the past decade, she and her husband, Jose Pina, a landscaper, have become involved in their community in New Carrollton. Their daughter, Heather, 6, is a U.S. citizen. Ledezma volunteers at Heather's school, reads with her at the public library and attends a local church.\par \par \uc2 "After so many years of living here, I of course consider this my home," she said.\par \par \uc2 According to estimates by the \uc2 Migration Policy Institute\uc2 , about a third of illegal immigrants own a home and have children who are U.S. citizens.\par \par \uc2 "We have this population here and they haven't left and they don't appear to be going back and forth to Mexico anymore,'' said George Escobar, senior director of human services for CASA, a Maryland-based immigrant advocacy group. "These trends have reshaped the immigration debate right before our eyes."\par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com\par \par \uc2 WP20150528dhsborder0528\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020150528eb5s0003w\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

Fahrenthold   \par \uc2 2,604 \uc2 words\par \uc2 26 April 2015\par \uc2 The Washington Post\par \uc2 WP\par \uc2 FINAL\par A01\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2015, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved   \par \par \uc2 Charles Dharapak AP Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), center, and other senators hold a news conference on immigration on April 18, 2013.\par \par \uc2 Marco Rubio\uc2  had changed his mind.\par \par \uc2 It was December 2012. The Senate gym. Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) was making the ask. "You ought to be a part of this," Durbin told Rubio (R-Fla.), as Rubio rode a stationary bike. Durbin and six other senators wanted to rewrite U.S. immigration laws. In the process, they wanted to give illegal immigrants a way to become legal residents and - eventually - citizens.\par \par \uc2 Just two years earlier, Rubio had been against doing that. "It is unfair," he had said, as a tea party candidate for Senate, "to create an alternative pathway for individuals who entered illegally."\par \par \uc2 But that morning in the gym, he was open to the idea. He was in.\par \par \uc2 With that, Rubio began the most consequential work he has done in Washington. As part of a bipartisan "Gang of Eight," he would write and pass a 1,198-page immigration bill through the Senate.\par \par \uc2 For a moment, that bill looked like the biggest success of Rubio's career.\par \par \uc2 Now it looks like failure.\par \par \uc2 It turned out that Rubio had overestimated conservatives' willingness to accept his hyper-complicated bill - and his own power to change their minds. Ultimately, the bill died in the House, his right-wing allies began to doubt his judgment, and both sides of the immigration debate had grown irritated over Rubio's tendency to change his mind.\par \par \uc2 Instead of a triumph, Rubio's involvement with the immigration bill became a cautionary tale about a gifted freshman who had miscalculated his capability.\par \par \uc2 Now, as he begins a run for president, Rubio is left trying to run away from the most prominent item on his political r\u233\'00\'E9sum\u233\'00\'E9.\par \par \uc2 "It's one of the worst squanderings of political capital I've ever witnessed," said Steve Deace, an Iowa-based conservative radio host whom Rubio tried and failed to convince. "It was the first time he ever stepped out in public in leadership on an issue, and it was in diametric opposition to the base."\par \par \uc2 Last week, when Rubio announced he was running, he made only a brief - and vague - reference to a desire to "modernize our immigration laws." In an interview with \uc2 NPR\uc2 , Rubio sought to take credit for being - at varying times - on both sides of the same bill.\par \par \uc2 He had tried to pass it. And, at the same time, he had warned that it wasn't good enough.\par \par \uc2 "I've done more immigration than Hillary Clinton ever did. I mean, I helped pass an immigration bill in a Senate dominated by Democrats. And that's more than she's ever done," Rubio said. "It didn't work because at the end of the day, we did not sufficiently address the issue of, of illegal immigration, and I warned about that throughout that process."\par \par \uc2 Charles Dharapak AP From left, Sens. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), Rubio, Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.), John McCain (R-Ariz.), Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) and Michael F. Bennet (D-Colo.).\par \par \uc2 The "gang" that recruited Rubio was led by four senators with a combined 66 years in office. For them, something existential was at stake.\par \par \uc2 For Durbin and Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), success would show that the Democratic-led Senate could still do what a Senate is supposed to: strike big deals, solve big problems.\par \par \uc2 For Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.), the goal was to fix Republicans' terrifying disadvantage with Latino voters. After all, their party's official "autopsy" of the 2012 election - in which President \uc2 Obama\uc2  had won 71 percent of the Latino vote - said Republicans had to embrace immigration reform. Or else.\par \par \uc2 "We'll never see the inside of the White House" again, McCain liked to say, if the gang couldn't strike a deal.\par \par \uc2 The other members were Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), Michael F. Bennet (D-Colo.) and Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.).\par \par \uc2 Rubio made eight. And on paper, he was perfect.\par \par \uc2 "He was bilingual in more than one way, right?" said Angela Kelley, then a staffer at the liberal \uc2 Center for American Progress\uc2 , who lobbied the group. "It wasn't just English to Spanish."\par \par \uc2 Rubio's parents were born in Cuba, and he spoke movingly about their experience as immigrants. But Rubio was also beloved by the very sort of small-government conservatives who had blocked immigration reform in the past. With a foot in both those worlds, Rubio held enormous leverage, even with the veteran senators.\par \par \uc2 That was clear in one meeting, described by four lobbyists in the room, where the GOP senators were being asked to agree to more "guest workers" in the bill.\par \par \uc2 Without more of these temporary immigrants, the lobbyists said, some low-skill jobs would go unfilled. McCain, they said, suggested an answer. Couldn't the children of illegal immigrants do those jobs?\par \par \uc2 Rubio, the son of immigrants, spoke up.\par \par \uc2 "He says, 'Pardon me, Senator, but I have to say that the children of those illegal immigrants will be doctors and lawyers,' " one lobbyist recalled. "In my mind, I was like, 'Thank God somebody said it.' Because nobody else could say that to McCain."\par \par \uc2 Rubio's staff declined to comment. In an interview, McCain said he couldn't recall saying anything like that. "That would contradict everything I've ever stood for and believe in about immigration," McCain said.\par \par \uc2 Rubio's influence also showed in negotiations over the details of the bill.\par \par \uc2 "People would talk, talk, talk. And he'd say, 'I can't sell that.' And that would be it," one Democratic staffer recalled. If Rubio said that conservatives wouldn't go for a particular idea, the group believed him.\par \par \uc2 In particular, Senate staffers said, Rubio insisted that the U.S.-Mexico border had to be much-better secured to stop the flow of new illegal immigrants before any current \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  could be granted legal status. Along with other Republicans, he pushed for more visas for highly skilled immigrants and for an independent "border commission" to provide oversight of federal enforcement efforts.\par \par \uc2 Still, even when Rubio got what he wanted, he could seem skittish.\par \par \uc2 "Reports that the bipartisan \uc2 group of eight\uc2  senators have agreed on a legislative proposal are premature," Rubio announced one day, just before others in the gang were about to announce progress in their talks. The veterans saw it as a dangerous airing of doubts, which might turn conservatives against them.\par \par \uc2 But they didn't scold Rubio for long.\par \par \uc2 "McCain might pull out some article that somebody had given him, and, say 'What is this?' And Marco would sort of say, 'What do you want me to do? I'm under a fire here,' " the Democratic staffer said. Other staffers familiar with the talks described the dynamic in similar ways. "What, are we going to kick him out? There was nothing we could have done to Rubio."\par \par \uc2 After that break, Rubio came back to the fold. Finally, the gang agreed on a bill.\par \par \uc2 "Actually, I changed my mind," Rubio said at the news conference, jokingly turning away from the lectern as if to flee.\par \par \uc2 "Not again!" Schumer said. "Once is enough!"\par \par \uc2 Now the salesman had to sell.\par \par \uc2 "Isn't it reasonable for these conservatives to assume that, uh, you've been duped here?" conservative radio host Laura Ingraham asked.\par \par \uc2 "No. It isn't," Rubio responded, citing items that Republicans had demanded in the talks. "They [Democrats] have come to our position. We haven't gone to theirs."\par \par \uc2 Rubio sounded tired. But he was still going.\par \par \uc2 Illegal immigrants are "not going to leave unless you literally go and apprehend them, put 'em on a plane and send them back," he told Ingraham. The Senate bill would have offered illegal immigrants a 10-year path to a "green card" and then to citizenship three years later. As long as they paid fines, passed a background check and learned English. "The millions of people that are here now, if they're not going to go back home . . . what's an alternative to that" that's still difficult and rigorous? Rubio asked.\par \par \uc2 He did Limbaugh. He did Hannity. He did private meetings with influential conservative activists and writers.\par \par \uc2 And on April 14, 2013, Rubio did the talking-head version of an ultramarathon: all five Sunday chat shows in one day, a rarely completed feat known as the "Full Ginsburg" (after the lawyer for Monica Lewinsky who was first to do it, in the 1990s). And then Rubio did two more, on \uc2 Telemundo\uc2  and Univision, in Spanish.\par \par \uc2 "The Full Marco!" Politico called it.\par \par \uc2 "Patch over his eye, knife in his mouth, going to defend the Senate bill in talk-radio land," Frank Sharry of America's Voice, a group that supported the immigration bill, said in an interview. "I've just gotta give him credit. Because he was taking the fight to the conservative media, in the spring of 2013, in a way that nobody ever had."\par \par \uc2 But, on conservative media, he didn't seem to be winning the fight. Rubio's right-wing interviewers were often respectful but unconvinced. In fact, they turned the tropes of the fight against "Obamacare" - the fight that helped launch Rubio's career - back on the young senator.\par \par \uc2 "You've got this thousand-plus page bill that purports to fix immigration," talk radio host Lars Larson started in.\par \par \uc2 "It's 840 pages, to be exact. Not a thousand," Rubio said. (It grew later.) "But, anyway, a lot of pages."\par \par \uc2 Rubio also faced conspiracy theories from conservatives who had dug through the bill and thought they knew what it was hiding.\par \par \uc2 "Move over, \uc2 Obama\uc2 -phone. This is the amnesty phone," Ingraham said, mentioning a provision that some thought would give free phones to immigrants.\par \par \uc2 "That's false," Rubio said. It was. The phones were meant for isolated ranchers on the border: They were for reporting illegal immigrants, not to reward them.\par \par \uc2 Rubio's office had to debunk the rumor, then debunk it again the next week when the first debunking didn't take. Then the rumor changed, and the debunking had to start over.\par \par \uc2 "[Conservatives] have heard that it creates a taxpayer subsidy for people to buy a car or a scooter," Rubio said at one point on the Senate floor, sounding exasperated. "That's just not true."\par \par \uc2 Democrats on the committee were impressed by his willingness to take fire. ("He didn't realize what he was getting into," a second Democratic staffer said. "And that's part of the beauty of new members.") But then, Rubio started voicing his own doubts. After weeks of trying to convince conservatives, it seemed that he had become unconvinced instead.\par \par \uc2 "We've got a bill that isn't going to become law," Rubio told radio host Hugh Hewitt. He said he couldn't support his own bill, because it wasn't conservative enough to pass the GOP-led House. Without amendments, he said, "I think we're wasting our time."\par \par \uc2 That rift, too, was mended. Rubio came back. The bill was amended, to double the number of federal border agents. It came up for a vote, and on June 27, Rubio gave his closing argument.\par \par \uc2 He spoke eloquently about his parents, about how the first words his father learned in English were, "I am looking for work." He recited the inscription on the Statue of Liberty: "Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed, to me. I lift my lamp beside the golden door!"\par \par \uc2 "Here in America," Rubio said at last, tapping the old Senate desk, "generations of unfulfilled dreams will finally come to pass. And that's why I support this reform. Not just because I believe in immigrants, but because I believe in America even more. I yield the floor."\par \par \uc2 The bill passed.\par \par \uc2 "An incredibly articulate spokesperson for the things we stand for and believe in," McCain called Rubio, when the group assembled for a triumphant news conference after the vote.\par \par \uc2 But at that point, they were no longer a gang of eight.\par \par \uc2 Rubio didn't show up.\par \par \uc2 "His goal was to get a bill through the Senate," said \uc2 Alex Conant\uc2 , who worked for Rubio at the time and is now a spokesman for Rubio's political committee. And since the Senate had passed the bill, he said, Rubio didn't need to attend. "He was not going to be part of any effort that would put pressure on the House, because he thought that it was going to be counterproductive," Conant said.\par \par \uc2 Reuters Presidential hopeful Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) outlined what he would do as president to tackle the immigration problem on \uc2 CBS\uc2 's "Face the Nation."\par \par \uc2 Rubio also did not participate in a massive effort, organized by Schumer, to lobby members of the House to take up immigration reform. In interviews, Rubio's sense of urgency seemed to be fading.\par \par \uc2 "I hope eventually we'll solve this problem," he told Sean Hannity on Fox News that July, the month after the bill passed. "Look, it's not the most important issue facing America. Obamacare is more important, for example."\par \par \uc2 As weeks passed, it became obvious that the House was not going to take up immigration anytime soon. It never did.\par \par \uc2 "I will admit to failure," said McCain, the only member of the Gang of Eight who agreed to be interviewed for this article. McCain said he did not think Rubio was more at fault than any other senator. "We obviously weren't able to get our position or our advocacy accepted by the House of Representatives, so that was clearly a failure. But it wasn't a failure of Marco any more than me."\par \par \uc2 Now, with his presidential run underway, Rubio has changed his mind about the bill he helped to write.\par \par \uc2 He says he would not support it today. Too big. Tried to do too much at once. Instead, Rubio wants to break the reforms up into smaller bills, starting with increased enforcement on the border.\par \par \uc2 Andrew Harrer Bloomberg News Rubio leaves the stage after speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference in February.\par \par \uc2 "What I've learned is you can't even have a conversation about that until people believe and know - not just believe, but it's proven to them - that future illegal immigration will be controlled," Rubio said at the Conservative Political Action Conference this year. After the border is secured first, he said, Congress can start talking about what to do with those already here.\par \par \uc2 If immigration reform is ever proposed again in the Senate, Rubio probably will not be there to see it. If he continues his run for president, he cannot run for reelection in Florida. He goes to the White House, or he goes home.\par \par \uc2 That idea made Giev Kashkooli, who works for the United Farm Workers of America labor union, think of a moment with Rubio during the immigration fight. As they and others waited for a meeting with veteran Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Rubio marveled at Feinstein's office wall.\par \par \uc2 It was covered with framed copies of bills she'd helped pass, mounted with the pens that presidents had used to sign them. The trophies of big fights won.\par \par \uc2 "I'd like to have an office like this," Kashkooli remembered Rubio saying.\par \par \uc2 Ed O'Keefe, Peyton Craighill and Scott Clement contributed to this report. \par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com\par \par \uc2 WP20150426rubioimmigration0419\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020150426eb4q0006e\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

Fahrenthold   \par \uc2 2,505 \uc2 words\par \uc2 25 April 2015\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2015, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Marco Rubio\uc2  had changed his mind.\par \par \uc2 It was December 2012. The Senate gym. Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) was making the ask. "You ought to be a part of this," Durbin told Rubio (R-Fla.), as Rubio rode a stationary bike. Durbin and six other senators wanted to rewrite U.S. immigration laws. In the process, they wanted to give illegal immigrants a way to become legal residents and \u8212\'20\'14 eventually \u8212\'20\'14 citizens.\par \par \uc2 Just two years earlier, Rubio had been against doing that. "It is unfair," he had said, as a tea party candidate for Senate, "to create an alternative pathway for individuals who entered illegally."\par \par \uc2 But that morning in the gym, he was open to the idea. He was in.\par \par \uc2 With that, Rubio began the most consequential work he has done in Washington. As part of a bipartisan "Gang of Eight," he would write and pass a 1,198-page immigration bill through the Senate.\par \par \uc2 For a moment, that bill looked like the biggest success of Rubio's career.\par \par \uc2 Now it looks like failure.\par \par \uc2 It turned out that Rubio had overestimated conservatives' willingness to accept his hyper-complicated bill \u8212\'20\'14 and his own power to change their minds. Ultimately, the bill died in the House, his right-wing allies began to doubt his judgment, and both sides of the immigration debate grew irritated over Rubio's tendency to change his mind.\par \par \uc2 Instead of a triumph, Rubio's involvement with the immigration bill became a cautionary tale about a gifted freshman who had miscalculated his capability.\par \par \uc2 Now, as he begins a run for president, Rubio is left trying to run away from the most prominent item on his political r\u233\'00\'E9sum\u233\'00\'E9.\par \par \uc2 "It's one of the worst squanderings of political capital I've ever witnessed," said Steve Deace, an Iowa-based conservative radio host whom Rubio tried and failed to convince. "It was the first time he ever stepped out in public in leadership on an issue, and it was in diametric opposition to the base."\par \par \uc2 Last week, when Rubio announced he was running, he made only a brief \u8212\'20\'14 and vague \u8212\'20\'14 reference to a desire to "modernize our immigration laws." In an interview with \uc2 NPR\uc2 , Rubio sought to take credit for being \u8212\'20\'14 at varying times \u8212\'20\'14 on both sides of the same bill.\par \par \uc2 He had tried to pass it. And, at the same time, he had warned that it wasn't good enough.\par \par \uc2 "I've done more immigration than Hillary Clinton ever did. I mean, I helped pass an immigration bill in a Senate dominated by Democrats. And that's more than she's ever done," Rubio said. "It didn't work because at the end of the day, we did not sufficiently address the issue of, of illegal immigration, and I warned about that throughout that process."\par \par \uc2 Much to lose\par \par \uc2 The "gang" that recruited Rubio was led by four senators with a combined 66 years in office. For them, something existential was at stake.\par \par \uc2 For Durbin and Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), success would show that the Democratic-led Senate could still do what a Senate is supposed to: strike big deals, solve big problems.\par \par \uc2 For Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.), the goal was to fix Republicans' terrifying disadvantage with Latino voters. After all, their party's official "autopsy" of the 2012 election \u8212\'20\'14 in which President \uc2 Obama\uc2  had won 71\u160\'00\'A0percent of the Latino vote \u8212\'20\'14 said Republicans had to embrace immigration reform. Or else.\par \par \uc2 "We'll never see the inside of the White House" again, McCain liked to say, if the gang couldn't strike a deal.\par \par \uc2 The other members were Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), Michael F. Bennet (D-Colo.) and Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.).\par \par \uc2 Rubio made eight. And on paper, he was perfect.\par \par \uc2 "He was bilingual in more than one way, right?" said Angela Kelley, then a staffer at the liberal \uc2 Center for American Progress\uc2 , who lobbied the group. "It wasn't just English to Spanish."\par \par \uc2 Rubio's parents were born in Cuba, and he spoke movingly about their experience as immigrants. But Rubio was also beloved by the very sort of small-government conservatives who had blocked immigration reform in the past. With a foot in both those worlds, Rubio held enormous leverage, even with the veteran senators.\par \par \uc2 That was clear in one meeting, described by four lobbyists in the room, where the GOP senators were being asked to agree to more "guest workers" in the bill.\par \par \uc2 Without more of these temporary immigrants, the lobbyists said, some low-skill jobs would go unfilled. McCain, they said, suggested an answer. Couldn't the children of illegal immigrants do those jobs?\par \par \uc2 Rubio, the son of immigrants, spoke up.\par \par \uc2 "He says, 'Pardon me, Senator, but I have to say that the children of those illegal immigrants will be doctors and lawyers,'\u160\'00\'A0" one lobbyist recalled. "In my mind, I was like, 'Thank God somebody said it.' Because nobody else could say that to McCain."\par \par \uc2 Rubio's staff declined to comment. In an interview, McCain said he couldn't recall saying anything like that. "That would contradict everything I've ever stood for and believe in about immigration," McCain said.\par \par \uc2 Rubio's influence also showed in negotiations over the details of the bill.\par \par \uc2 "People would talk, talk, talk. And he'd say, 'I can't sell that.' And that would be it," one Democratic staffer recalled. If Rubio said that conservatives wouldn't go for a particular idea, the group believed him.\par \par \uc2 In particular, Senate staffers said, Rubio insisted that the U.S.-Mexico border had to be much-better secured to stop the flow of new illegal immigrants before any current \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  could be granted legal status. Along with other Republicans, he pushed for more visas for highly skilled immigrants and for an independent "border commission" to provide oversight of federal enforcement efforts.\par \par \uc2 Still, even when Rubio got what he wanted, he could seem skittish.\par \par \uc2 "Reports that the bipartisan \uc2 group of eight\uc2  senators have agreed on a legislative proposal are premature," Rubio announced one day, just before others in the gang were about to announce progress in their talks. The veterans saw it as a dangerous airing of doubts, which might turn conservatives against them.\par \par \uc2 But they didn't scold Rubio for long.\par \par \uc2 "McCain might pull out some article that somebody had given him and say, 'What is this?' And Marco would sort of say, 'What do you want me to do? I'm under a fire here,'\u160\'00\'A0" the Democratic staffer said. Other staffers familiar with the talks described the dynamic in similar ways. "What, are we going to kick him out? There was nothing we could have done to Rubio."\par \par \uc2 After that break, Rubio came back to the fold. Finally, the gang agreed on a bill.\par \par \uc2 "Actually, I changed my mind," Rubio said at the news conference, jokingly turning away from the lectern as if to flee.\par \par \uc2 "Not again!" Schumer said. "Once is enough!"\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18The Full Marco!\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 Now the salesman had to sell.\par \par \uc2 "Isn't it reasonable for these conservatives to assume that, uh, you've been duped here?" conservative radio host Laura Ingraham asked.\par \par \uc2 "No. It isn't," Rubio responded, citing items that Republicans had demanded in the talks. "They [Democrats] have come to our position. We haven't gone to theirs."\par \par \uc2 Rubio sounded tired. But he was still going.\par \par \uc2 Illegal immigrants are "not going to leave unless you literally go and apprehend them, put 'em on a plane and send them back," he told Ingraham. The Senate bill would have offered illegal immigrants a 10-year path to a "green card" and then to citizenship three years later. As long as they paid fines, passed a background check and learned English. "The millions of people that are here now, if they're not going to go back home .\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09. what's an alternative to that" that's still difficult and rigorous? Rubio asked.\par \par \uc2 He did Limbaugh. He did Hannity. He did private meetings with influential conservative activists and writers.\par \par \uc2 And on April 14, 2013, Rubio did the talking-head version of an ultramarathon: all five Sunday chat shows in one day, a rarely completed feat known as the "Full Ginsburg" (after the lawyer for Monica Lewinsky who was the first to do it, in the 1990s). And then Rubio did two more, on \uc2 Telemundo\uc2  and Univision, in Spanish.\par \par \uc2 "The Full Marco!" Politico called it.\par \par \uc2 "Patch over his eye, knife in his mouth, going to defend the Senate bill in talk-radio land," Frank Sharry of America's Voice, a group that supported the immigration bill, said in an interview. "I've just gotta give him credit. Because he was taking the fight to the conservative media, in the spring of 2013, in a way that nobody ever had."\par \par \uc2 But, on conservative media, he didn't seem to be winning the fight. Rubio's right-wing interviewers were often respectful but unconvinced. In fact, they turned the tropes of the fight against "Obamacare" \u8212\'20\'14 the fight that helped launch Rubio's career \u8212\'20\'14 back on the young senator.\par \par \uc2 "You've got this thousand-plus-page bill that purports to fix immigration," talk radio host Lars Larson started in.\par \par \uc2 "It's 840 pages, to be exact. Not a thousand," Rubio said. (It grew later.) "But, anyway, a lot of pages."\par \par \uc2 Rubio also faced conspiracy theories from conservatives who had dug through the bill and thought they knew what it was hiding.\par \par \uc2 "Move over, \uc2 Obama\uc2 -phone. This is the amnesty phone," Ingraham said, mentioning a provision that some thought would give free phones to immigrants.\par \par \uc2 "That's false," Rubio said. It was. The phones were meant for isolated ranchers on the border: They were for reporting illegal immigrants, not to reward them.\par \par \uc2 Rubio's office had to debunk the rumor, then debunk it again the next week when the first debunking didn't take. Then the rumor changed, and the debunking had to start over.\par \par \uc2 "[Conservatives] have heard that it creates a taxpayer subsidy for people to buy a car or a scooter," Rubio said at one point on the Senate floor, sounding exasperated. "That's just not true."\par \par \uc2 Democrats on the committee were impressed by his willingness to take fire. ("He didn't realize what he was getting into," a second Democratic staffer said. "And that's part of the beauty of new members.") But then, Rubio started voicing his own doubts. After weeks of trying to convince conservatives, it seemed that he had become unconvinced instead.\par \par \uc2 "We've got a bill that isn't going to become law," Rubio told radio host Hugh Hewitt. He said he couldn't support his own bill, because it wasn't conservative enough to pass the GOP-led House. Without amendments, he said, "I think we're wasting our time."\par \par \uc2 That rift, too, was mended. Rubio came back. The bill was amended, to double the number of federal border agents. It came up for a vote, and on June 27, Rubio gave his closing argument.\par \par \uc2 He spoke eloquently about his parents, about how the first words his father learned in English were, "I am looking for work." He recited the inscription on the Statue of Liberty: "Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed, to me. I lift my lamp beside the golden door!"\par \par \uc2 "Here in America," Rubio said at last, tapping the old Senate desk, "generations of unfulfilled dreams will finally come to pass. And that's why I support this reform. Not just because I believe in immigrants, but because I believe in America even more. I yield the floor."\par \par \uc2 The bill passed.\par \par \uc2 "An incredibly articulate spokesperson for the things we stand for and believe in," McCain called Rubio, when the group assembled for a triumphant news conference after the vote.\par \par \uc2 But at that point, they were no longer a gang of eight.\par \par \uc2 Rubio didn't show up.\par \par \uc2 Failure in the House\par \par \uc2 "His goal was to get a bill through the Senate," said \uc2 Alex Conant\uc2 , who worked for Rubio at the time and is now a spokesman for Rubio's political committee. And since the Senate had passed the bill, he said, Rubio didn't need to attend. "He was not going to be part of any effort that would put pressure on the House, because he thought that it was going to be counterproductive," Conant said.\par \par \uc2 Rubio also did not participate in a massive effort, organized by Schumer, to lobby members of the House to take up immigration reform. In interviews, Rubio's sense of urgency seemed to be fading.\par \par \uc2 "I hope eventually we'll solve this problem," he told Sean Hannity on Fox News that July, the month after the bill passed. "Look, it's not the most important issue facing America. Obamacare is more important, for example."\par \par \uc2 As weeks passed, it became obvious that the House was not going to take up immigration anytime soon. It never did.\par \par \uc2 "I will admit to failure," said McCain, the only member of the Gang of Eight who agreed to be interviewed for this article. McCain said he did not think Rubio was more at fault than any other senator. "We obviously weren't able to get our position or our advocacy accepted by the House of Representatives, so that was clearly a failure. But it wasn't a failure of Marco any more than me."\par \par \uc2 Now, with his presidential run underway, Rubio has changed his mind about the bill he helped to write.\par \par \uc2 He says he would not support it today. Too big. Tried to do too much at once. Instead, Rubio wants to break the reforms up into smaller bills, starting with increased enforcement on the border.\par \par \uc2 "What I've learned is you can't even have a conversation about that until people believe and know \u8212\'20\'14 not just believe, but it's proven to them \u8212\'20\'14 that future illegal immigration will be controlled," Rubio said at the Conservative Political Action Conference this year. After the border is secured, he said, Congress can start talking about what to do with those already here.\par \par \uc2 If immigration reform is ever proposed again in the Senate, Rubio probably will not be there to see it. If he continues his run for president, he cannot run for reelection in Florida. He goes to the White House, or he goes home.\par \par \uc2 That idea made Giev Kashkooli, who works for the United Farm Workers of America labor union, think of a moment with Rubio during the immigration fight. As they and others waited for a meeting with veteran Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Rubio marveled at Feinstein's office wall.\par \par \uc2 It was covered with framed copies of bills she'd helped pass, mounted with the pens that presidents had used to sign them. The trophies of big fights won.\par \par \uc2 "I'd like to have an office like this," Kashkooli remembered Rubio saying.\par \par \uc2 david.fahrenthold@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 Ed O'Keefe, Peyton Craighill and Scott Clement contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020150424eb4o004ee\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved   \par \par \uc2 Charles Dharapak AP Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), center, and other senators hold a news conference on immigration on April 18, 2013.\par \par \uc2 Marco Rubio\uc2  had changed his mind.\par \par \uc2 It was December 2012. The Senate gym. Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) was making the ask. "You ought to be a part of this," Durbin told Rubio (R-Fla.), as Rubio rode a stationary bike. Durbin and six other senators wanted to rewrite U.S. immigration laws. In the process, they wanted to give illegal immigrants a way to become legal residents and - eventually - citizens.\par \par \uc2 Just two years earlier, Rubio had been against doing that. "It is unfair," he had said, as a tea party candidate for Senate, "to create an alternative pathway for individuals who entered illegally."\par \par \uc2 But that morning in the gym, he was open to the idea. He was in.\par \par \uc2 With that, Rubio began the most consequential work he has done in Washington. As part of a bipartisan "Gang of Eight," he would write and pass a 1,198-page immigration bill through the Senate.\par \par \uc2 For a moment, that bill looked like the biggest success of Rubio's career.\par \par \uc2 Now it looks like failure.\par \par \uc2 It turned out that Rubio had overestimated conservatives' willingness to accept his hyper-complicated bill - and his own power to change their minds. Ultimately, the bill died in the House, his right-wing allies began to doubt his judgment, and both sides of the immigration debate grew irritated over Rubio's tendency to change his mind.\par \par \uc2 Instead of a triumph, Rubio's involvement with the immigration bill became a cautionary tale about a gifted freshman who had miscalculated his capability.\par \par \uc2 Now, as he begins a run for president, Rubio is left trying to run away from the most prominent item on his political r\u233\'00\'E9sum\u233\'00\'E9.\par \par \uc2 "It's one of the worst squanderings of political capital I've ever witnessed," said Steve Deace, an Iowa-based conservative radio host whom Rubio tried and failed to convince. "It was the first time he ever stepped out in public in leadership on an issue, and it was in diametric opposition to the base."\par \par \uc2 Last week, when Rubio announced he was running, he made only a brief - and vague - reference to a desire to "modernize our immigration laws." In an interview with \uc2 NPR\uc2 , Rubio sought to take credit for being - at varying times - on both sides of the same bill.\par \par \uc2 He had tried to pass it. And, at the same time, he had warned that it wasn't good enough.\par \par \uc2 "I've done more immigration than Hillary Clinton ever did. I mean, I helped pass an immigration bill in a Senate dominated by Democrats. And that's more than she's ever done," Rubio said. "It didn't work because at the end of the day, we did not sufficiently address the issue of, of illegal immigration, and I warned about that throughout that process."\par \par \uc2 Charles Dharapak AP From left, Sens. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), Rubio, Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.), John McCain (R-Ariz.), Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) and Michael F. Bennet (D-Colo.).\par \par \uc2 The "gang" that recruited Rubio was led by four senators with a combined 66 years in office. For them, something existential was at stake.\par \par \uc2 For Durbin and Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), success would show that the Democratic-led Senate could still do what a Senate is supposed to: strike big deals, solve big problems.\par \par \uc2 For Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.), the goal was to fix Republicans' terrifying disadvantage with Latino voters. After all, their party's official "autopsy" of the 2012 election - in which President \uc2 Obama\uc2  had won 71 percent of the Latino vote - said Republicans had to embrace immigration reform. Or else.\par \par \uc2 "We'll never see the inside of the White House" again, McCain liked to say, if the gang couldn't strike a deal.\par \par \uc2 The other members were Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), Michael F. Bennet (D-Colo.) and Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.).\par \par \uc2 Rubio made eight. And on paper, he was perfect.\par \par \uc2 "He was bilingual in more than one way, right?" said Angela Kelley, then a staffer at the liberal \uc2 Center for American Progress\uc2 , who lobbied the group. "It wasn't just English to Spanish."\par \par \uc2 Rubio's parents were born in Cuba, and he spoke movingly about their experience as immigrants. But Rubio was also beloved by the very sort of small-government conservatives who had blocked immigration reform in the past. With a foot in both those worlds, Rubio held enormous leverage, even with the veteran senators.\par \par \uc2 That was clear in one meeting, described by four lobbyists in the room, where the GOP senators were being asked to agree to more "guest workers" in the bill.\par \par \uc2 Without more of these temporary immigrants, the lobbyists said, some low-skill jobs would go unfilled. McCain, they said, suggested an answer. Couldn't the children of illegal immigrants do those jobs?\par \par \uc2 Rubio, the son of immigrants, spoke up.\par \par \uc2 "He says, 'Pardon me, Senator, but I have to say that the children of those illegal immigrants will be doctors and lawyers,' " one lobbyist recalled. "In my mind, I was like, 'Thank God somebody said it.' Because nobody else could say that to McCain."\par \par \uc2 Rubio's staff declined to comment. In an interview, McCain said he couldn't recall saying anything like that. "That would contradict everything I've ever stood for and believe in about immigration," McCain said.\par \par \uc2 Rubio's influence also showed in negotiations over the details of the bill.\par \par \uc2 "People would talk, talk, talk. And he'd say, 'I can't sell that.' And that would be it," one Democratic staffer recalled. If Rubio said that conservatives wouldn't go for a particular idea, the group believed him.\par \par \uc2 In particular, Senate staffers said, Rubio insisted that the U.S.-Mexico border had to be much-better secured to stop the flow of new illegal immigrants before any current \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  could be granted legal status. Along with other Republicans, he pushed for more visas for highly skilled immigrants and for an independent "border commission" to provide oversight of federal enforcement efforts.\par \par \uc2 Still, even when Rubio got what he wanted, he could seem skittish.\par \par \uc2 "Reports that the bipartisan \uc2 group of eight\uc2  senators have agreed on a legislative proposal are premature," Rubio announced one day, just before others in the gang were about to announce progress in their talks. The veterans saw it as a dangerous airing of doubts, which might turn conservatives against them.\par \par \uc2 But they didn't scold Rubio for long.\par \par \uc2 "McCain might pull out some article that somebody had given him and say, 'What is this?' And Marco would sort of say, 'What do you want me to do? I'm under a fire here,' " the Democratic staffer said. Other staffers familiar with the talks described the dynamic in similar ways. "What, are we going to kick him out? There was nothing we could have done to Rubio."\par \par \uc2 After that break, Rubio came back to the fold. Finally, the gang agreed on a bill.\par \par \uc2 "Actually, I changed my mind," Rubio said at the news conference, jokingly turning away from the lectern as if to flee.\par \par \uc2 "Not again!" Schumer said. "Once is enough!"\par \par \uc2 Now the salesman had to sell.\par \par \uc2 "Isn't it reasonable for these conservatives to assume that, uh, you've been duped here?" conservative radio host Laura Ingraham asked.\par \par \uc2 "No. It isn't," Rubio responded, citing items that Republicans had demanded in the talks. "They [Democrats] have come to our position. We haven't gone to theirs."\par \par \uc2 Rubio sounded tired. But he was still going.\par \par \uc2 Illegal immigrants are "not going to leave unless you literally go and apprehend them, put 'em on a plane and send them back," he told Ingraham. The Senate bill would have offered illegal immigrants a 10-year path to a "green card" and then to citizenship three years later. As long as they paid fines, passed a background check and learned English. "The millions of people that are here now, if they're not going to go back home . . . what's an alternative to that" that's still difficult and rigorous? Rubio asked.\par \par \uc2 He did Limbaugh. He did Hannity. He did private meetings with influential conservative activists and writers.\par \par \uc2 And on April 14, 2013, Rubio did the talking-head version of an ultramarathon: all five Sunday chat shows in one day, a rarely completed feat known as the "Full Ginsburg" (after the lawyer for Monica Lewinsky who was the first to do it, in the 1990s). And then Rubio did two more, on \uc2 Telemundo\uc2  and Univision, in Spanish.\par \par \uc2 "The Full Marco!" Politico called it.\par \par \uc2 "Patch over his eye, knife in his mouth, going to defend the Senate bill in talk-radio land," Frank Sharry of America's Voice, a group that supported the immigration bill, said in an interview. "I've just gotta give him credit. Because he was taking the fight to the conservative media, in the spring of 2013, in a way that nobody ever had."\par \par \uc2 But, on conservative media, he didn't seem to be winning the fight. Rubio's right-wing interviewers were often respectful but unconvinced. In fact, they turned the tropes of the fight against "Obamacare" - the fight that helped launch Rubio's career - back on the young senator.\par \par \uc2 "You've got this thousand-plus-page bill that purports to fix immigration," talk radio host Lars Larson started in.\par \par \uc2 "It's 840 pages, to be exact. Not a thousand," Rubio said. (It grew later.) "But, anyway, a lot of pages."\par \par \uc2 Rubio also faced conspiracy theories from conservatives who had dug through the bill and thought they knew what it was hiding.\par \par \uc2 "Move over, \uc2 Obama\uc2 -phone. This is the amnesty phone," Ingraham said, mentioning a provision that some thought would give free phones to immigrants.\par \par \uc2 "That's false," Rubio said. It was. The phones were meant for isolated ranchers on the border: They were for reporting illegal immigrants, not to reward them.\par \par \uc2 Rubio's office had to debunk the rumor, then debunk it again the next week when the first debunking didn't take. Then the rumor changed, and the debunking had to start over.\par \par \uc2 "[Conservatives] have heard that it creates a taxpayer subsidy for people to buy a car or a scooter," Rubio said at one point on the Senate floor, sounding exasperated. "That's just not true."\par \par \uc2 Democrats on the committee were impressed by his willingness to take fire. ("He didn't realize what he was getting into," a second Democratic staffer said. "And that's part of the beauty of new members.") But then, Rubio started voicing his own doubts. After weeks of trying to convince conservatives, it seemed that he had become unconvinced instead.\par \par \uc2 "We've got a bill that isn't going to become law," Rubio told radio host Hugh Hewitt. He said he couldn't support his own bill, because it wasn't conservative enough to pass the GOP-led House. Without amendments, he said, "I think we're wasting our time."\par \par \uc2 That rift, too, was mended. Rubio came back. The bill was amended, to double the number of federal border agents. It came up for a vote, and on June 27, Rubio gave his closing argument.\par \par \uc2 He spoke eloquently about his parents, about how the first words his father learned in English were, "I am looking for work." He recited the inscription on the Statue of Liberty: "Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed, to me. I lift my lamp beside the golden door!"\par \par \uc2 "Here in America," Rubio said at last, tapping the old Senate desk, "generations of unfulfilled dreams will finally come to pass. And that's why I support this reform. Not just because I believe in immigrants, but because I believe in America even more. I yield the floor."\par \par \uc2 The bill passed.\par \par \uc2 "An incredibly articulate spokesperson for the things we stand for and believe in," McCain called Rubio, when the group assembled for a triumphant news conference after the vote.\par \par \uc2 But at that point, they were no longer a gang of eight.\par \par \uc2 Rubio didn't show up.\par \par \uc2 "His goal was to get a bill through the Senate," said \uc2 Alex Conant\uc2 , who worked for Rubio at the time and is now a spokesman for Rubio's political committee. And since the Senate had passed the bill, he said, Rubio didn't need to attend. "He was not going to be part of any effort that would put pressure on the House, because he thought that it was going to be counterproductive," Conant said.\par \par \uc2 Reuters Presidential hopeful Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) outlined what he would do as president to tackle the immigration problem on \uc2 CBS\uc2 's "Face the Nation."\par \par \uc2 Rubio also did not participate in a massive effort, organized by Schumer, to lobby members of the House to take up immigration reform. In interviews, Rubio's sense of urgency seemed to be fading.\par \par \uc2 "I hope eventually we'll solve this problem," he told Sean Hannity on Fox News that July, the month after the bill passed. "Look, it's not the most important issue facing America. Obamacare is more important, for example."\par \par \uc2 As weeks passed, it became obvious that the House was not going to take up immigration anytime soon. It never did.\par \par \uc2 "I will admit to failure," said McCain, the only member of the Gang of Eight who agreed to be interviewed for this article. McCain said he did not think Rubio was more at fault than any other senator. "We obviously weren't able to get our position or our advocacy accepted by the House of Representatives, so that was clearly a failure. But it wasn't a failure of Marco any more than me."\par \par \uc2 Now, with his presidential run underway, Rubio has changed his mind about the bill he helped to write.\par \par \uc2 He says he would not support it today. Too big. Tried to do too much at once. Instead, Rubio wants to break the reforms up into smaller bills, starting with increased enforcement on the border.\par \par \uc2 Andrew Harrer Bloomberg News Rubio leaves the stage after speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference in February.\par \par \uc2 "What I've learned is you can't even have a conversation about that until people believe and know - not just believe, but it's proven to them - that future illegal immigration will be controlled," Rubio said at the Conservative Political Action Conference this year. After the border is secured, he said, Congress can start talking about what to do with those already here.\par \par \uc2 If immigration reform is ever proposed again in the Senate, Rubio probably will not be there to see it. If he continues his run for president, he cannot run for reelection in Florida. He goes to the White House, or he goes home.\par \par \uc2 That idea made Giev Kashkooli, who works for the United Farm Workers of America labor union, think of a moment with Rubio during the immigration fight. As they and others waited for a meeting with veteran Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Rubio marveled at Feinstein's office wall.\par \par \uc2 It was covered with framed copies of bills she'd helped pass, mounted with the pens that presidents had used to sign them. The trophies of big fights won.\par \par \uc2 "I'd like to have an office like this," Kashkooli remembered Rubio saying.\par \par \uc2 Ed O'Keefe, Peyton Craighill and Scott Clement contributed to this report. \par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com\par \par \uc2 WP20150425rubioimmigration0419\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020150425eb4p0002j\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Jos\u233\'00\'E9 Andr\u233\'00\'E9s in 2016?\par \par \uc2 During his keynote address at the \uc2 International Association of Culinary Professionals\uc2  conference Saturday morning, Andr\u233\'00\'E9s sounded more like a presidential candidate than a chef and restaurateur. He argued for immigration reform. He made a plea for raising the minimum wage. He criticized the Farm Bill. He even had an idea or two on foreign policy and national defense.\par \par \uc2 Dressed in multiple layers \u8212\'20\'14 a russet-colored sport coat over an insulated vest over a red sweater over a dress shirt, clearly a concession to the unseasonal temperatures \u8212\'20\'14 Andr\u233\'00\'E9s largely ditched his prepared remarks and spoke spontaneously to the gathered chefs, authors, researchers and academics. He regularly roamed the stage and urged the culinary professionals to understand their power to make changes in the world.\par \par \uc2 "We are a big family. We are a powerful family. I want everybody to really understand the power," says Andr\u233\'00\'E9s. "We are not alone. We are all, we are we. When we realize that.\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09. we can do great things in this 21st century because America and the world is going to be in huge need."\par \par \uc2 The Spanish native provided an example from his own experiences with ThinkFoodGroup, which has 21 restaurants around the United States and Puerto Rico. Last year, when Mayor Vincent C. Gray signed a new minimum wage bill, Andr\u233\'00\'E9s and ThinkFoodGroup decided to move faster than the new law required. Instead of paying their approximately 1,100 workers at least $9.50 an hour, as the law mandated last July, ThinkFoodGroup paid them at least $10.50 an hour. This year, the company will do the same: When the law mandates a jump to $10.50 an hour in July, it will pay employees $11.50 an hour, a year before the District requires the same wage.\par \par \uc2 "Why are we doing this?" Andr\u233\'00\'E9s asked. "Because we feed the few, but we need to be taking care of feeding the many. We have employees that, at the end of the day, they have to go on food stamps to pay their bills.\par \par \uc2 "I know I'm going to make less money, but I hope that one day when I'm in my bed before going to my next chapter in life, I will remember that at least we tried," he added.\par \par \uc2 The chef's talk of poorly paid restaurant employees reminded him there's another class of workers even lower on the food world's organizational chart: field laborers, many of them undocumented.\par \par \uc2 "When a senator and a congressman are in my restaurant eating a carrot, probably that carrot was picked by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . It's about time we make immigration reform happen," Andr\u233\'00\'E9s said.\par \par \uc2 The chef had to pause while the crowd applauded.\par \par \uc2 "I want to have secure borders. I love this country. We need to keep the democracy that we are, but we cannot be living that dream that everything is cool," Andr\u233\'00\'E9s continued. "Immigration reform should be yesterday."\par \par \uc2 Andr\u233\'00\'E9s noted how food plays a role in some of the country's thorniest issues, including obesity and national security.\par \par \uc2 "You think that your profession has anything to do with national security? Sure it does, people!" he said. "Right now, our Army is not able to fulfill its obligations and cover all the needs of the Army because the vast majority of Americans, either they've been in jail or we are obese."\par \par \uc2 While Andr\u233\'00\'E9s reminded the audience they can be part of the solution, by serving better and more nutritious food, he argued the government often undercuts its own interests by subsidizing crops that are used to produce some of the most unhealthful fare, like soft drinks and processed foods. First lady Michelle Obama may want Americans to fill half their plates with fruits and vegetables, but the government makes that difficult.\par \par \uc2 "Let me tell you, the Farm Bill is the biggest problem America faces when it can be the biggest opportunity America faces," Andr\u233\'00\'E9s said. "You know the subsidies for vegetables and fruits? One percent!"\par \par \uc2 "What America should do is make sure the field is level," he added. "A Farm Bill [should] serve all America, not a few corporations that benefit from it."\par \par \uc2 Andr\u233\'00\'E9s also talked about his role with the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves, a public-private partnership to improve health and the environment by finding clean and efficient methods for cooking food. He drew a bleak picture of how an open-charcoal or wood-burning stove in Haiti can lead to multiple problems: It can shorten the lives of people who inhale the smoke; it can lead to environmental damage when children and families continue to cut down trees to fuel their stoves; and it can lead to endless poverty as children miss school to gather wood.\par \par \uc2 "We need to be finding ways to make sure that fire is going to be changing the lives of over a billion people in the world that today are using fossil fuels," he said. "The fire should be our friend, not our enemy."\par \par \uc2 The chef concluded his nearly hour-long remarks with a video of his latest concept, Beefsteak, a mostly vegetable restaurant that he hopes one day will serve as many customers as that chain with the Golden Arches out front.\par \par \uc2 "I can tell you that I'm envious of \uc2 McDonald's\uc2 . I want to feed millions a day," he said. "But we're going to have to be more creative. It's okay to have a fancy restaurant, but I think it's [time] to realize who do you want to feed America: a chef or a corporation? I think it's very clear to me the answer."\par \par \uc2 tim.carman@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020150328eb3s005hc\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved   \par \par \uc2 Undocumented immigrants hold more white-collar jobs and fewer blue-collar jobs today than they did before the national recession of 2007-2009, but most remain concentrated in lower-skilled, low-paying jobs, "much more so than U.S.-born workers," according to a report released Thursday by the \uc2 Pew Research Center\uc2  in the District.\par \par \uc2 The report, based on a five-year study from 2007 to 2012, found that the size of the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  workforce has remained at 5.1 percent of all workers, even though the total number of illegal immigrants has fallen from a peak of 12.2 million in 2007 to approximately 11.2 million in 2012.\par \par \uc2 Overall, it described an undocumented workforce that has stabilized during a period of economic recovery and has moved up in certain semi-skilled and professional occupations, but that has remained limited by language barriers, poor education and legal status and has been clustered in low-level occupations.\par \par \uc2 The senior demographer for Pew, \uc2 Jeffrey Passel\uc2 , presented the report's findings at a Senate hearing Thursday. He stressed that as the illegal population has fallen, its remaining workers have settled into the United States and their job prospects have shifted mostly in response to national economic trends.\par \par \uc2 "These are people who are embedded and participating in the economy," Passel said after the hearing. "More than 60 percent have been here at least 10 years. The changes we see in what they are doing and where they work reflect broader trends."\par \par \uc2 Although the majority of illegal immigrants are from Mexico, the report noted that in the Washington region, the largest number are from Central America. In Virginia, Maryland and the District, they are employed mainly in service jobs in hotels, restaurants, buildings and grounds, and private homes.\par \par \uc2 Nationwide, Pew reported, the portion of unauthorized workers in professional or business jobs - including sales and office support - grew from 10 to 13 percent, while the portion in production and construction declined from 34 to 29 percent. As in the past, though, it said "a solid majority" still toil at low-wage jobs including farm labor.\par \par \uc2 [Judge's ruling derails plans of immigrants seeking legal status]\par \par \uc2 Critics of illegal immigration complain that undocumented workers squeeze out American-born workers by undercutting wages. The Pew report did not address that issue, but it found that far higher percentages of illegal immigrants than U.S.-born workers hold jobs with the least desirable conditions, such as crop-picking and animal slaughter.\par \par \uc2 Sen. Thomas Carper (D-Del), the ranking Democrat at Thursday's hearing, said that U.S. officials "need to get serious about enforcing laws against the hiring of undocumented immigrants," but that the government must also "provide adequate ways for immigrants to work here legally when we do need help."\par \par \uc2 In certain occupations, the contrast between undocumented and U.S.-born immigrants is especially dramatic. Only 0.5 percent of workers born in the United States are employed in farming, fishing or forestry; 4 percent of unauthorized aliens work in those areas.\par \par \uc2 Although the portion of illegal immigrants in professional jobs remains low, the report noted that, under several policies enacted or proposed by the White House, a substantial number are obtaining temporary legal status, giving them access to better education and professional jobs.\par \par \uc2 The work performed by illegal immigrants varies among states, the report found. In 39 states and the District, the largest number work in service jobs, but in 34 states, they hold the largest share of all farming, fishing and forestry jobs.\par \par \uc2 Nationwide, unauthorized immigrants are clustered in a few occupations, notably farming, fishing and forestry (26 percent of the workforce), building and grounds (17 percent), and construction and mining (14 percent). They make up 24 percent of all groundskeepers, 23 percent of domestic workers and 20 percent of those in clothing manufacture.\par \par \uc2 They also have carved out niches in some relatively well-paid construction trades. They hold 34 percent of all jobs in drywall installation, 27 percent in roofing and 24 percent in painting. Passel also noted that many illegal immigrants who overstayed temporary visas have higher education levels that enable them to work in office or technical jobs.\par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com\par \par \uc2 WP20150327immiglabor0327\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020150327eb3r0003p\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Undocumented immigrants hold more white-collar jobs and fewer blue-collar jobs today than they did before the national recession of 2007-2009, but most remain concentrated in lower-skilled, low-paying jobs, "much more so than U.S.-born workers," according to a report released Thursday by the \uc2 Pew Research Center\uc2  in the District.\par \par \uc2 The report, based on a five-year study from 2007 to 2012, found that the size of the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  workforce has remained at 5.1 percent of all workers, even though the total number of illegal immigrants has fallen from a peak of 12.2 million in 2007 to about 11.2 million in 2012.\par \par \uc2 Overall, it described an undocumented workforce that has stabilized during a period of economic recovery and has moved up in certain semi-skilled and professional occupations, but that has remained limited by language barriers, poor education and legal status and clustered in low-level occupations.\par \par \uc2 The senior demographer for Pew, \uc2 Jeffrey Passel\uc2 , presented the report's findings at a Senate hearing Thursday. He stressed that as the illegal population has fallen, its remaining workers have settled into the U.S. and their job prospects have shifted mostly in response to national economic trends.\par \par \uc2 "These are people who are embedded and participating in the economy," Passel said after the hearing. "More than 60 percent have been here at least ten years. The changes we see in what they are doing and where they work reflect broader trends."\par \par \uc2 Although the majority of illegal immigrants are from Mexico, the report noted that in the Washington region, the largest number are from Central America. In Virginia, Maryland and the District, they are employed mainly in service jobs in hotels, restaurants, buildings and grounds, and private homes.\par \par \uc2 Nationwide, Pew reported, the portion of unauthorized workers in professional or business jobs \u8212\'20\'14 including sales and office support \u8212\'20\'14 grew from 10 to 13 percent, while the portion in production and construction declined from 34 to 29 percent. As in the past, though, it said "a solid majority" still toil at low-wage jobs including farm labor.\par \par \uc2 Critics of illegal immigration complain that undocumented workers squeeze out American-born workers by undercutting wages. The Pew report did not address that issue, but it found that far higher percentages of illegal immigrants than U.S.-born workers now hold jobs with the least desirable conditions, such as crop picking and animal slaughter.\par \par \uc2 Sen. Thomas Carper (D-Del), the ranking Democrat at Thursday's hearing, said that U.S. officials "need to get serious about enforcing laws against the hiring of undocumented immigrants," but that the government must also "provide adequate ways for immigrants to work here legally when we do need help."\par \par \uc2 In certain occupations, the contrast between undocumented and U.S.-born immigrants is especially dramatic. Only 0.5 percent of U.S-born workers are employed in farming, fishing or forestry, while 4 percent of unauthorized aliens work in those fields,\par \par \uc2 Although the portion of illegal immigrants in professional jobs remains low, the report noted that, under several policies enacted or proposed by the White House, a substantial number are obtaining temporary legal status, giving them access to better education and professional jobs.\par \par \uc2 The work performed by illegal immigrants varies among states, the report found. In 39 states and the District, the largest number work in service jobs, but in 34 states, they hold the largest share of all farming, fishing and forestry jobs.\par \par \uc2 Nationwide, unauthorized immigrants are clustered in a few occupations, notably farming, fishing and forestry (26 percent of the workforce), building and grounds (17 percent), and construction and mining (14 percent). They comprise 24 percent of all groundskeepers, 23 percent of domestic workers and 20 percent of those in clothing manufacture.\par \par \uc2 In addition, they have carved out niches in certain relatively well-paid construction trades. They hold 34 percent of all jobs in drywall installation, 27 percent in roofing and 24 percent in painting. Passel also noted that many illegal immigrants who overstayed temporary visas have higher education levels that enable them to work in office or technical jobs.\par \par \uc2 pamela.constable@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020150326eb3q0048w\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

Alexander   \par \uc2 1,203 \uc2 words\par \uc2 23 March 2015\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2015, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Longtime D.C. defense lawyer Michele Roberts recalled handling a gun-possession case she thought would be an easy win. When she saw her opponent, a prosecutor fresh out of law school, she laughed and warned him that if he didn't dismiss the case, she would "embarrass" him in court.\par \par \uc2 "I used to have young prosecutors for lunch," Roberts teased.\par \par \uc2 But the moment Vincent H. Cohen Jr. began his opening statement in that case in the late 1990s, Roberts said, she knew he was no lightweight.\par \par \uc2 "He made it very clear that this was going to be a trial. He was such a handful," Roberts, now executive director of the National Basketball Players Association, said in a telephone interview from her New York offices. "He tried the case like a veteran. I made it up in my mind this kid is not going to beat me. I knew I was up against a real lawyer."\par \par \uc2 That kind of drive pushed Cohen, 44, through a career that took him into the private sector and then back to the D.C. federal prosecutor's office, recently as second-in-command. Next week, he will become acting U.S. attorney in the District, filling in after the resignation of U.S. Attorney Ronald C. Machen.\par \par \uc2 His move comes during a challenging time for the largest U.S. attorney's office in the nation.\par \par \uc2 The office has come under increased scrutiny during its four-year investigation of former mayor Vincent C. Gray (D). Prosecutors publicly accused Gray of having detailed knowledge of a "shadow campaign" to illegally funnel $660,000 into his 2010 get-out-the-vote campaign. Gray has called the allegations "lies."\par \par \uc2 Machen and Cohen, longtime friends, have overseen the Gray investigation since it was launched. Several of Gray's aides have been prosecuted, but there have been no charges against the former mayor or an announcement that the investigation has ended.\par \par \uc2 In recent weeks, the U.S. Attorney's Office also has publicly sparred with police and city crime lab officials. Prosecutors have said they are reviewing more than 100 cases that may have been affected as a result of what his office called faulty DNA analysis by the District's DNA lab. And Machen recently alerted defense lawyers that a "problem" in a computer system used by D.C. police may have inadvertently omitted evidentiary information from police reports in many cases, dating back to 2012.\par \par \uc2 Machen often referred to Cohen as the "best" first assistant U.S. attorney in the country and said he expects complete "continuity" when Cohen takes over.\par \par \uc2 "He knows this office inside and out, and a lot of the successes we've had, he has played a significant role," Machen said in an interview. As the longest-serving chief federal prosecutor in nearly four decades, Machen plans to return to private practice.\par \par \uc2 Machen and Cohen were hired at the office in 1997 by \uc2 Eric H. Holder Jr\uc2 ., then U.S. attorney for the District. Cohen has served as Machen's No. 2 since President Obama selected Machen as the District's top prosecutor in 2010.\par \par \uc2 Machen said Cohen played a key role in some of the office's biggest cases, including the 2013 prosecution of former Chicago congressman Jesse Jackson Jr., who pleaded guilty to defrauding his reelection campaign of more than $750,000, as well as the ongoing investigation that uncovered the largest domestic bribery and bid-rigging scheme in the history of federal contracting cases.\par \par \uc2 "Over the past five years, it has been an honor to serve the community where I was born and raised, and I am committed to continuing that work for the people of the District of Columbia," Cohen said.\par \par \uc2 For "Vo," the nickname of Cohen's youth given to him by one of his older sisters who couldn't pronounce his name when she was a child, law was the family business. His father, Vincent H. Cohen Sr., became one of the District's first African American lawyers to rise to partner level, just three years after joining the \uc2 Hogan & Hartson\uc2  law firm in 1969. When the elder Cohen died on Christmas 2011 at age 75, nearly 1,000 Washington-area politicians, judges, lawyers and business executives, including Gray, Holder and D.C. Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton gathered to pay tribute at the memorial service at the Washington Convention Center.\par \par \uc2 As a youth, Cohen attended D.C. public schools until he was accepted into \uc2 Sidwell Friends School\uc2  in Northwest Washington, long before presidents Clinton and Obama sent their children to the school. During his senior year, Cohen was elected president of the school's black student union, which included a handful of minority students at the school. There, Cohen tried to bridge a coalition among other handfuls of African American students at the District's elite private schools such as Georgetown Visitation Preparatory School and St. John's College High School.\par \par \uc2 He went on to attend \uc2 Syracuse University\uc2  and in 1995 graduated from its law school. Both he and Machen are Omega Psi Phi fraternity brothers.\par \par \uc2 After six years with the U.S. Attorney's Office, Cohen joined the defense side at \uc2 Hogan & Hartson\uc2 , the firm where his father worked. At Hogan, Cohen specialized in white-collar criminal cases and employment law.\par \par \uc2 Cohen worked with another \uc2 Hogan & Hartson\uc2  lawyer from the firm's New York office in 2005 to help investigate the genocide in Rwanda. That other prosecutor was Loretta B. Lynch, Obama's nominee for U.S. attorney general. During several trips to Tanzania and Rwanda for meetings with the \uc2 International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda\uc2 , Lynch and Cohen spent days interviewing dozens of witnesses and survivors.\par \par \uc2 Danny Onorato, a defense lawyer who formerly served as a prosecutor alongside Cohen, called him "fierce, measured and fair as a prosecutor." Onorato also worked with Cohen years later when Onorato co-founded his own firm, which Cohen later joined as a partner, before returning to the U.S. Attorney's Office.\par \par \uc2 Until a full-time U.S attorney is selected to serve at least through the 2016 presidential election, Cohen will be busy.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors are preparing for the upcoming trial of Libyan terrorism suspect Ahmed Abu Khattala. And the conviction of Ingmar Guandique, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from El Salvador who was found guilty of the 2001 slaying of federal intern Chandra Levy, is back in D.C. Superior Court on appeal. And on Friday, charges were filed against a former FBI agent accused of stealing heroin from the bureau's evidence room.\par \par \uc2 In a statement, Holder recalled hiring Cohen in 1997, saying since then he has "stood out as an exceptional prosecutor, a fair and forceful leader and a committed public servant."\par \par \uc2 Roberts, who also spent time as a D.C. public defender, says she won that gun case many years ago in which she sparred against Cohen.\par \par \uc2 "Well, I wouldn't have shared that story if I had lost," she mused. But she also gained respect for Cohen.\par \par \uc2 "He's the complete package," she said.\par \par \uc2 keith.alexander@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020150322eb3m005v5\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

Alexander   \par \uc2 1,201 \uc2 words\par \uc2 23 March 2015\par \uc2 The Washington Post\par \uc2 WP\par \uc2 FINAL\par B01\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2015, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved   \par \par \uc2 Longtime D.C. defense lawyer Michele Roberts recalled handling a gun-possession case she thought would be an easy win. When she saw her opponent, a prosecutor fresh out of law school, she laughed and warned him that if he didn't dismiss the case, she would "embarrass" him in court.\par \par \uc2 "I used to have young prosecutors for lunch," Roberts teased.\par \par \uc2 But the moment Vincent H. Cohen Jr. began his opening statement in that case in the late 1990s, Roberts said, she knew he was no lightweight.\par \par \uc2 "He made it very clear that this was going to be a trial. He was such a handful," Roberts, now executive director of the National Basketball Players Association, said in a telephone interview from her New York offices. "He tried the case like a veteran. I made it up in my mind this kid is not going to beat me. I knew I was up against a real lawyer."\par \par \uc2 That kind of drive pushed Cohen, 44, through a career that took him into the private sector and then back to the D.C. federal prosecutor's office, recently as second-in-command. Next week, he will become acting U.S. attorney in the District, filling in after the resignation of U.S. Attorney Ronald C. Machen.\par \par \uc2 His move comes during a challenging time for the largest U.S. attorney's office in the nation.\par \par \uc2 The office has come under increased scrutiny during its four-year investigation of former mayor Vincent C. Gray (D). Prosecutors publicly accused Gray of having detailed knowledge of a "shadow campaign" to illegally funnel $660,000 into his 2010 get-out-the-vote campaign. Gray has called the allegations "lies."\par \par \uc2 Machen and Cohen, longtime friends, have overseen the Gray investigation since it was launched. Several of Gray's aides have been prosecuted, but there have been no charges against the former mayor or an announcement that the investigation has ended.\par \par \uc2 In recent weeks, the U.S. Attorney's Office also has publicly sparred with police and city crime lab officials. Prosecutors have said they are reviewing more than 100 cases that may have been affected as a result of what his office called faulty DNA analysis by the District's DNA lab. And Machen recently alerted defense lawyers that a "problem" in a computer system used by D.C. police may have inadvertently omitted evidentiary information from police reports in many cases, dating back to 2012.\par \par \uc2 Machen often referred to Cohen as the "best" first assistant U.S. attorney in the country and said he expects complete "continuity" when Cohen takes over.\par \par \uc2 "He knows this office inside and out, and a lot of the successes we've had, he has played a significant role," Machen said in an interview. As the longest-serving chief federal prosecutor in nearly four decades, Machen plans to return to private practice.\par \par \uc2 Machen and Cohen were hired at the office in 1997 by \uc2 Eric H. Holder Jr\uc2 ., then U.S. attorney for the District. Cohen has served as Machen's No. 2 since President Obama selected Machen as the District's top prosecutor in 2010.\par \par \uc2 Machen said Cohen played a key role in some of the office's biggest cases, including the 2013 prosecution of former Chicago congressman Jesse Jackson Jr., who pleaded guilty to defrauding his reelection campaign of more than $750,000, as well as the ongoing investigation that uncovered the largest domestic bribery and bid-rigging scheme in the history of federal contracting cases.\par \par \uc2 "Over the past five years, it has been an honor to serve the community where I was born and raised, and I am committed to continuing that work for the people of the District of Columbia," Cohen said.\par \par \uc2 For "Vo," the nickname of Cohen's youth given to him by one of his older sisters who couldn't pronounce his name when she was a child, law was the family business. His father, Vincent H. Cohen Sr., became one of the District's first African American lawyers to rise to partner level, just three years after joining the \uc2 Hogan & Hartson\uc2  law firm in 1969. When the elder Cohen died on Christmas 2011 at age 75, nearly 1,000 Washington-area politicians, judges, lawyers and business executives, including Gray, Holder and D.C. Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton gathered to pay tribute at the memorial service at the Washington Convention Center.\par \par \uc2 As a youth, Cohen attended D.C. public schools until he was accepted into \uc2 Sidwell Friends School\uc2  in Northwest Washington, long before presidents Clinton and Obama sent their children to the school. During his senior year, Cohen was elected president of the school's black student union, which included a handful of minority students at the school. There, Cohen tried to bridge a coalition among other handfuls of African American students at the District's elite private schools such as Georgetown Visitation Preparatory School and St. John's College High School.\par \par \uc2 He went on to attend \uc2 Syracuse University\uc2  and in 1995 graduated from its law school. Both he and Machen are Omega Psi Phi fraternity brothers.\par \par \uc2 After six years with the U.S. Attorney's Office, Cohen joined the defense side at \uc2 Hogan & Hartson\uc2 , the firm where his father worked. At Hogan, Cohen specialized in white-collar criminal cases and employment law.\par \par \uc2 Cohen worked with another \uc2 Hogan & Hartson\uc2  lawyer from the firm's New York office in 2005 to help investigate the genocide in Rwanda. That other prosecutor was Loretta B. Lynch, Obama's nominee for U.S. attorney general. During several trips to Tanzania and Rwanda for meetings with the \uc2 International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda\uc2 , Lynch and Cohen spent days interviewing dozens of witnesses and survivors.\par \par \uc2 Danny Onorato, a defense lawyer who formerly served as a prosecutor alongside Cohen, called him "fierce, measured and fair as a prosecutor." Onorato also worked with Cohen years later when Onorato co-founded his own firm, which Cohen later joined as a partner, before returning to the U.S. Attorney's Office.\par \par \uc2 Until a full-time U.S attorney is selected to serve at least through the 2016 presidential election, Cohen will be busy.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors are preparing for the upcoming trial of Libyan terrorism suspect Ahmed Abu Khattala. And the conviction of Ingmar Guandique, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from El Salvador who was found guilty of the 2001 slaying of federal intern Chandra Levy, is back in D.C. Superior Court on appeal. And on Friday, charges were filed against a former FBI agent accused of stealing heroin from the bureau's evidence room.\par \par \uc2 In a statement, Holder recalled hiring Cohen in 1997, saying since then he has "stood out as an exceptional prosecutor, a fair and forceful leader and a committed public servant."\par \par \uc2 Roberts, who also spent time as a D.C. public defender, says she won that gun case many years ago in which she sparred against Cohen.\par \par \uc2 "Well, I wouldn't have shared that story if I had lost," she mused. But she also gained respect for Cohen.\par \par \uc2 "He's the complete package," she said.\par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com\par \par \uc2 WP20150323cohen0323\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020150323eb3n0000k\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The House Judiciary Committee published an article about immigration this week using reaction gifs to explain a Republican bill aimed at allowing state and local governments enforce federal immigration law.\par \par \uc2 The post is sort of blah. (Speaker Boehner's office's posted a piece about President Obama's community college plan using only\u160\'00\'A0Taylor Swift gifs\u160\'00\'A0that was\u160\'00\'A0more clever.). But, the Internet has come to the rescue (again!) as a handful of people have pointed out one thing in particular\u160\'00\'A0about the post's use of the above gif of Ariel from "The Little Mermaid"; that one thing is that she herself may well be an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  due to her residency "under the sea."\par \par \uc2 Someone tell #Republicans that Ariel is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from the MerKingdom. {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://t.co/dnbK5gPkRx"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://t.co/dnbK5gPkRx}}}\uc2  #\uc2 Disney\uc2  #anchorbabywithPrinceEric\par \par \uc2 @EditingNLayout Isn't Ariel an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 ?\par \par \uc2 What da what? Also Ariel is an illegal; she's from under the sea. RT @jeffpearlman: This could be no more mortifying {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://t.co/tTGs7yliML"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://t.co/tTGs7yliML}}}\par \par \uc2 But how easy would it be for Ariel to legally immigrate? Since Ariel doesn't come to the U.S. in the film, we'll have to look elsewhere for answers. The author of the original book, Hans Christian Andersen, was from Denmark, so what would Danish immigration law do with a mermaid like Ariel? Here are some of the requirements,\u160\'00\'A0according to the BBC:\par \par \uc2 She is her princess. Her father is a king. This is their castle. Assuming she inherits this, yes, she will be financially independent.\par \par \uc2 OK, so she doesn't really know much about Danish society, but she\u160\'00\'A0wants to. She has a commitment to collecting thingamabobs and dinglehoppers, and she wants to learn more about it.\par \par \uc2 Sorry, Ariel is a teenager. She does not meet the requirement.\par \par \uc2 Coming to the United States would be difficult for Ariel. \uc2 Wendy Feliz\uc2 , a spokesperson for the \uc2 American Immigration Council\uc2  told the Fix in a phone interview there are generally only three ways to get into the country: having family here (are there any American mermaids living in the U.S.), getting a job here\u160\'00\'A0(imagine how difficult that would be without family when your voice was stolen by an evil sea witch), or if she was a refugee (does\u160\'00\'A0getting your voice stolen by an evil seawitch count?)\par \par \uc2 So, yes, this is a dumb debate, but we didn't start it. The House Judiciary committee, which deals with issues like immigration policy as well as judicial proceedings, civil liberties, and whether to consider presidential impeachment charges, did. \u160\'00\'A0So blame Bob Goodlatte.\par \par \uc2 And, just to close the loop: Ariel would have to wait a few years before immigrating to Denmark. Or \u160\'00\'A0she could try the other side of the Atlantic. The world is her oyster.\par \par \uc2 BOOM.\par \par \uc2 This post has been updated with additional information about immigration into the U.S.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020150320eb3k005y3\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 fact-checker\par {\*\bkmkstart toc96}{\*\bkmkend toc96}\b \uc2 Lawmaker claims illegal immigrants released by Obama are committing a murder a day \b0\par\par\uc2 By Glenn Kessler   \par \uc2 977 \uc2 words\par \uc2 5 March 2015\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2015, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 "Every day, all along border states, maybe other places, there are murders by people who have been arrested coming into this country, who have been released by the Obama administration, I believe in violation of the law, who are murdering Americans all over our cities. We hold the Democrat Party and the president personally accountable for this action."\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Tex.), remarks in a \uc2 House Rules Committee\uc2  hearing, Feb. 26, 2015\par \par \uc2 This was a rather striking statement made by the chairman of the House Rules Commitee \u8212\'20\'14 that there is a murder committed "every day" in cities across the nation by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  released by the Obama administration.\par \par \uc2 A reader was dubious of this claim, and we certainly were skeptical. What data could he be pointing to?\par \par \uc2 The Facts\par \par \uc2 There are on average 44 murders a day in the United States, according to the \uc2 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\uc2 . Assuming murders by illegal immigrants were prorated as a percentage of the U.S. population, it is not unreasonable to assume one to two murders a day are committed by illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 But that's just a straight-line calculation \u8212\'20\'14 and Sessions was not talking about the 11 million or so illegal immigrants, but about the 130,000, including 30,000 with previous criminal records, that the Obama administration released in the 2014 fiscal year that ended on Sept. 30.\par \par \uc2 (We should note that immigration agents removed nearly 316,000 people in the fiscal year that ended in 2014, most of whom were convicted of a crime. That was a decrease of 14 percent from the previous year.)\par \par \uc2 Since there are no nationwide data kept on murders committed by illegal immigrants, let alone on immigrants who are released by the Obama administration, Sessions's staff struggled to come up with something that would confirm his assertion.\par \par \uc2 "Thousands of illegal immigrants have been convicted of crimes, and President Obama has allowed them to stay in the United States of America, and the president's unwise, unlawful and unconstitutional executive actions on immigration will only cause an increase in risk to our public safety," said a Sessions spokesman who declined to be identified.\par \par \uc2 Note that the statement actually tries to subtly change the meaning of Sessions's remarks \u8212\'20\'14 that Obama is allowing immigrants who have been convicted of crimes to stay in the United States, not that people released by the Obama administration have committed crimes.\par \par \uc2 The spokesman also passed along a pie chart produced by the \uc2 Texas Department of Public Safety\uc2  purporting to show that aliens were accused of committing 3,000 homicides in 2014. (In U.S. law, "alien" means any person in the country who is not a U.S. citizen or national.) But it turned out this was data over a six-year period \u8212\'20\'14 2008 to 2014 \u8212\'20\'14 and the Department of Public Safety at the time did not know which of these people arrested were in the country illegally; it only knew they were not U.S. citizens. In fact, the chart was so old that it no longer appears on the agency's Web site.\par \par \uc2 Instead, the agency has overhauled the crime data to track immigration status dating from June 2011. "We reprogrammed our own criminal records system to identify the \uc2 DHS\uc2  immigration status code on all the available historical responses and all hits responses going forward," said spokesman Tom Vinger. This resulted in a dramatic reduction in the numbers, because of a short time frame and confirmed immigration status.\par \par \uc2 Thus, over a 43-month period, 795 aliens were accused of homicide, and 336 were convicted. Of the charges, Vinger said 561 (71 percent) are attributed to foreign nationals illegally in the country and 234 (29 percent) are attributed to legally present foreign nationals. A breakdown of actual convictions was not immediately available, but assuming the same percentage, that would mean 239 illegal aliens were convicted of murder over a 43-month period.\u160\'00\'A0(Note: These numbers are for arrests and convictions, not the number of people.)\par \par \uc2 That works out to about one murder every five days, not every day, from every \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , not just those released by the administration \u8212\'20\'14 and Texas has a much larger share of the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  population than most states. Even if\u160\'00\'A0you wanted to do a simple straight-line calculation based on the fact that Texas is about 8.4 percent of the U.S. population, that adds up to about two murders a day. But as we noted above, that's just about what one would expect given the size of the illegal population and average murder rates in the United States.\par \par \uc2 Remember that\u160\'00\'A0Sessions was talking about murders committed by people released by the administration, which is a much smaller universe. Indeed, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) in January released a report tracking crimes committed by 36,000 illegal immigrants who had criminal records and were released in 2013. One thousand of these one-time criminals had added to their\u160\'00\'A0criminal record, including such charges as assault with a deadly weapon, terrorist threats, failure to register as a sex offender, and spousal rape. But murder or homicide was not even on the list.\par \par \uc2 The Pinocchio Test\par \par \uc2 As always, the burden of proof rests with the speaker. Sessions failed to provide any convincing evidence to show that illegal immigrants released by the Obama administration are committing a murder a day. He earns Four Pinocchios.\par \par \uc2 One can debate the merits of the administration's immigration policies without resorting to nonsense facts. Sessions is a committee chairman, and he should know better.\par \par \uc2 Four Pinocchios\par \par \uc2 (About our rating scale)\par \par \uc2 Send us facts to check by filling out this form\par \par \uc2 Follow The Fact Checker on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and friend us on \uc2 Facebook\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020150305eb350066a\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 fact-checker\par {\*\bkmkstart toc97}{\*\bkmkend toc97}\b \uc2 Lawmaker claims illegal immigrants released by Obama are committing a murder a day \b0\par\par\uc2 By Glenn Kessler   \par \uc2 964 \uc2 words\par \uc2 5 March 2015\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2015, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 "Every day, all along border states, maybe other places, there are murders by people who have been arrested coming into this country, who have been released by the Obama administration, I believe in violation of the law, who are murdering Americans all over our cities. We hold the Democrat Party and the president personally accountable for this action."\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Tex.), remarks in a \uc2 House Rules Committee\uc2  hearing, Feb. 26, 2015\par \par \uc2 This was a rather striking statement made by the chairman of the House Rules Commitee \u8212\'20\'14 that there is a murder committed "every day" in cities across the nation by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  released by the Obama administration.\par \par \uc2 A reader was dubious of this claim, and we certainly were skeptical. What data could he be pointing to?\par \par \uc2 The Facts\par \par \uc2 There are on average 44 murders a day in the United States, according to the \uc2 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\uc2 . Assuming murders by illegal immigrants were prorated as a percentage of the U.S. population, it is not unreasonable to assume one to two murders a day are committed by illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 But that's just a straight-line calculation \u8212\'20\'14 and Sessions was not talking about the 11 million or so illegal immigrants, but about the 130,000, including 30,000 with previous criminal records, that the Obama administration released in the 2014 fiscal year that ended on Sept. 30.\par \par \uc2 (We should note that immigration agents removed nearly 316,000 people in the fiscal year that ended in 2014, most of whom were convicted of a crime. That was a decrease of 14 percent from the previous year.)\par \par \uc2 Since there are no nationwide data kept on murders committed by illegal immigrants, let alone on immigrants who are released by the Obama administration, Sessions's staff struggled to come up with something that would confirm his assertion.\par \par \uc2 "Thousands of illegal immigrants have been convicted of crimes, and President Obama has allowed them to stay in the United States of America, and the president's unwise, unlawful and unconstitutional executive actions on immigration will only cause an increase in risk to our public safety," said a Sessions spokesman who declined to be identified.\par \par \uc2 Note that the statement actually tries to subtly change the meaning of Sessions's remarks \u8212\'20\'14 that Obama is allowing immigrants who have been convicted of crimes to stay in the United States, not that people released by the Obama administration have committed crimes.\par \par \uc2 The spokesman also passed along a pie chart produced by the \uc2 Texas Department of Public Safety\uc2  purporting to show that aliens were accused of committing 3,000 homicides in 2014. (In U.S. law, "alien" means any person in the country who is not a U.S. citizen or national.) But it turned out this was data over a six-year period \u8212\'20\'14 2008 to 2014 \u8212\'20\'14 and the Department of Public Safety at the time did not know which of these people arrested were in the country illegally; it only knew they were not U.S. citizens. In fact, the chart was so old that it no longer appears on the agency's Web site.\par \par \uc2 Instead, the agency has overhauled the crime data to track immigration status dating from June 2011. "We reprogrammed our own criminal records system to identify the \uc2 DHS\uc2  immigration status code on all the available historical responses and all hits responses going forward," said spokesman Tom Vinger. This resulted in a dramatic reduction in the numbers, because of a short time frame and confirmed immigration status.\par \par \uc2 Thus, over a 43-month period, 795 aliens were accused of homicide, and 336 were convicted. Of the charges, Vinger said 561 (71 percent) are attributed to foreign nationals illegally in the country and 234 (29 percent) are attributed to legally present foreign nationals. A breakdown of actual convictions was not immediately available, but assuming the same percentage, that would mean 239 illegal aliens were convicted of murder over a 43-month period.\par \par \uc2 That works out to about one murder every five days, not every day, from every \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , not just those released by the administration \u8212\'20\'14 and Texas has a much larger share of the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  population than most states. Even if\u160\'00\'A0you wanted to do a simple straight-line calculation based on the fact that Texas is about 8.4 percent of the U.S. population, that adds up to about two murders a day. But as we noted above, that's just about what one would expect given the size of the illegal population and average murder rates in the United States.\par \par \uc2 Remember that\u160\'00\'A0Sessions was talking about murders committed by people released by the administration, which is a much smaller universe. Indeed, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) in January released a report tracking crimes committed by 36,000 illegal immigrants who had criminal records and were released in 2013. One thousand of these one-time criminals had added to their\u160\'00\'A0criminal record, including such charges as assault with a deadly weapon, terrorist threats, failure to register as a sex offender, and spousal rape. But murder or homicide was not even on the list.\par \par \uc2 The Pinocchio Test\par \par \uc2 As always, the burden of proof rests with the speaker. Sessions failed to provide any convincing evidence to show that illegal immigrants released by the Obama administration are committing a murder a day. He earns Four Pinocchios.\par \par \uc2 One can debate the merits of the administration's immigration policies without resorting to nonsense facts. Sessions is a committee chairman, and he should know better.\par \par \uc2 Four Pinocchios\par \par \uc2 (About our rating scale)\par \par \uc2 Send us facts to check by filling out this form\par \par \uc2 Follow The Fact Checker on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and friend us on \uc2 Facebook\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020150305eb35002p9\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 CONGRESSIONAL REPUBLICANS are so busy this week flirting with a partial government shutdown \u8212\'20\'14 their target is the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2  and its 240,000 employees \u8212\'20\'14 that they may have missed fresh evidence of how badly out of step with the American public they are on the issue of illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 It is precisely that issue that has driven the GOP to the brink of a funding cutoff for \uc2 DHS\uc2 , a move that would trigger furloughs for some 30,000 employees; force tens of thousands more to work without pay; freeze grants for law enforcement agencies nationwide; and further debilitate an already demoralized department that includes the Secret Service, Coast Guard and Customs and Border Protection.\par \par \uc2 As it happens, 60\u160\'00\'A0percent of Americans \u8212\'20\'14 and roughly equal segments of Republicans, Democrats and independents \u8212\'20\'14 oppose the GOP's tactic of threatening homeland security funding as a means to subvert the Obama administration's immigration policy. According to a new \uc2 CBS News\uc2  poll, a clear majority thinks the department's funding "should be kept separate from immigration policy."\par \par \uc2 Yet even on immigration policy, the GOP is at sea. Hard-line Republicans in the House refused to take up a bill passed by \uc2 the Senate\uc2  in 2013, with moderate GOP support, that would have laid out a path to citizenship for 11\u160\'00\'A0million illegal immigrants. They also refused to devise any alternative legislation to address the question of how to handle those undocumented immigrants \u8212\'20\'14 even to grant them legal status short of citizenship.\par \par \uc2 Instead, most House Republicans insist on somehow "securing" the border before they will discuss the fate of the undocumented, without defining what would constitute a secure border or acknowledging that by virtually every objective measure it is currently more secure, and under tighter federal surveillance, than at any point in decades.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, Americans are approaching a consensus on the issue, and in a very different place. In a large and important new survey, majorities in all 50 states favored a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants. More than three-quarters of Americans supported either citizenship or legal status for them. By contrast, just 19\u160\'00\'A0percent wanted to identify and deport illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 The results of the survey, based on 50,000 interviews conducted last year by the nonpartisan Public Religion Research Institute, are striking. They suggest that Americans are far more united on the question of illegal immigration than they are on same-sex marriage or abortion. Overall, 60\u160\'00\'A0percent of those surveyed supported citizenship for illegal immigrants if certain requirements were met. Even in Wyoming, the most \uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2 -skeptical state surveyed, advocates for a path to citizenship outnumbered deportation backers, 52 percent to 38\u160\'00\'A0percent.\par \par \uc2 Increasingly, Republicans who use illegal immigration as a wedge issue are at odds not just with the Obama administration, Democrats and Hispanics; they are also at odds with majorities of Americans in every region of the nation. That's a recipe for political marginalization.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020150226eb2q0005m\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 "It was learned the household income deferred tax credit applied retroactively for three years. So each illegal alien will get $24,000 in compensation." [The crowd expresses some surprise at this fact, with one person saying "what?"] "Yep, absolutely. You start looking at the process where the GDP [gross domestic product] of Mexico, the second largest input to that, is our system of Social Security and benefits."\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.), remarks at a rural issues roundtable, Payson, Ariz., Feb. 9, 2015\par \par \uc2 Lawmakers often hold town hall meetings in their communities to explain what is happening in Washington. But how reliable is the information that is being given at these events?\par \par \uc2 We wondered that as we watched a clip of one such meeting, held by Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.). As you can see, the crowd is quite taken aback by one his assertions \u8212\'20\'14 that President Obama proposes to give $24,000 to "each illegal alien." Then he goes onto to say that the second-largest part of the Mexican gross domestic product consists of benefits from Social Security.\par \par \uc2 Neither of those statements is remotely true. In one case, there's an element of truth, but the second statement is really wrong.\par \par \uc2 The Facts\par \par \uc2 First, regarding the $24,000, Gosar is referring to the fact that Obama's executive action shielding about 4 million immigrants from deportation \u8212\'20\'14 currently temporarily suspended because of an adverse judicial ruling \u8212\'20\'14 would allow illegal immigrants to receive Social Security numbers. With those numbers, they could file amended tax returns for the last three years claiming the Earned Income Tax Credit. (Gosar called it the "household deferred tax credit," but he meant the EITC.)\par \par \uc2 A Treasury Department spokesman confirmed that such retroactive claims would be possible, but likely would be cumbersome and possibly costly. "Filing original returns for prior years would likely be difficult, since filers would have to reconstruct earnings and other records for years when they were not able to work on the books," the spokesman said. "In addition, in order to claim the EITC, these households would need to report income which may result in them owing taxes."\par \par \uc2 Moreover, Gosar claimed that every illegal would get $24,000, when that is the maximum possible. The Treasury spokesman said few would qualify for that amount: "The maximum credit is only available to taxpayers with three or more children and who are within a specific income range \u8212\'20\'14 only about 12 percent of EITC recipients report having three or more children, and many of these individuals have incomes that would not qualify for the maximum credit." (See figure H in this report.)\par \par \uc2 The Fact Checker obviously takes no position on what foes of immigration are calling "amnesty bonuses." But\u160\'00\'A0it should be noted \u8212\'20\'14 as the Associated Press did in an article on the issue \u8212\'20\'14 that illegal immigrants have been paying into Social Security already. \uc2 Stephen Goss\uc2 , Social Security's chief actuary, told the AP that over the past decade, illegal immigrants have paid $100 billion in Social Security payroll taxes, even though until now they could not hope to claim any benefits after retirement.\par \par \uc2 "The congressman was implying that each illegal alien family eligible for the tax credit could receive as much as $24,000 in compensation," Gosar spokesman Steven Smith said.\par \par \uc2 But Gosar really went off the rails when he claimed that Social Security and other benefits made up the second-biggest part of Mexico's gross domestic product. It took days to get an answer, but Smith said that Gosar was talking about remittances and their impact on the Mexican economy.\par \par \uc2 As Emilly Litella would say, "Never mind."\u160\'00\'A0 That's a big difference. We had not been able to find any evidence that Social Security played much of a role in the Mexican economy, especially since an agreement that would allow Mexicans who have earned benefits to receive them in Mexico has not been ratified by Congress.\par \par \uc2 Even then, remittances\u160\'00\'A0\u8212\'20\'14 transfers of money\u160\'00\'A0by a\u160\'00\'A0foreign worker\u160\'00\'A0to an individual in his or her home country \u8212\'20\'14 are not the second-biggest contributor to Mexico's GDP, but just 2 percent. Indeed, in terms of remittances as a share of GDP, Mexico is in the among Latin American countries.\par \par \uc2 Mexico received $24 billion in remittances in 2014, but according to the \uc2 World Bank\uc2 , that places it fourth in terms of total amount. India received $71 billion in remittances, China $64 billion and the Philippines $28 billion. The \uc2 World Bank\uc2  pays close attention to these numbers because remittances are considered a good thing for a nation's economy; countries with high inflows of remittances are permitted to borrow more.\par \par \uc2 However, Mexico is in first place in terms of remittances from the United States, followed by China, India and the Philippines. (You can follow the flows with this nifty interactive map from Pew Research Center.)\par \par \uc2 "The point Congressman Gosar was making is that it is overwhelmingly clear that remittances, primarily fueled by income and benefits earned in the United States, are fueling our current immigration crisis in countries like Mexico," Smith said.\par \par \uc2 The Pinocchio Test\par \par \uc2 Lawmakers have an obligation to speak accurately to their constituents.\par \par \uc2 In the first quote, Gosar would have been on more solid ground if he had been clear that he was talking about the maximum that an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  might receive from the EITC \u8212\'20\'14 and that few would qualify to receive this amount. Instead, he portrayed it as a cash payment to every illegal worker covered by Obama's action. Contrary to Smith's explanation, he did not imply anything else\u160\'00\'A0\u8212\'20\'14 and in fact, he asserted "yep, absolutely" when an audience member expressed surprise.\par \par \uc2 In the second statement,\u160\'00\'A0\u160\'00\'A0Gosar suggested that the Mexican economy was being propped up by\u160\'00\'A0Social Security payments, which also is false.\par \par \uc2 Remittances are a different story, and one can certainly have an opinion on whether that fuels immigration, illegal or otherwise. But that's not what Gosar\u160\'00\'A0said. He said that Social Security and other benefits represent the second-biggest part of the GDP, when instead he supposedly meant to say that remittances are 2 percent of \u160\'00\'A0Mexico's GDP.\par \par \uc2 The mistake on the $24,000 is worthy of three Pinocchios, but the other statement earns Gosar\u160\'00\'A0four.\par \par \uc2 Four Pinocchios\par \par \uc2 (About our rating scale)\par \par
