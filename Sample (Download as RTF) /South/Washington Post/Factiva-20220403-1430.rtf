All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 "It was learned the household income deferred tax credit applied retroactively for three years. So each illegal alien will get $24,000 in compensation." [The crowd expresses some surprise at this fact, with one person saying "wow."] "Yep, absolutely. You start looking at the process where the GDP [gross domestic product] of Mexico, the second largest input to that, is our system of Social Security and benefits."\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.), remarks at a rural issues roundtable, Payson, Ariz., Feb. 9, 2015\par \par \uc2 Lawmakers often hold town hall meetings in their communities to explain what is happening in Washington. But how reliable is the information that is being given at these events?\par \par \uc2 We wondered that as we watched a clip of one such meeting, held by Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.). As you can see, the crowd is quite taken aback by one his assertions \u8212\'20\'14 that President Obama proposes to give $24,000 to "each illegal alien." Then he goes onto to say that second-largest part of the Mexican gross domestic product are benefits from Social Security.\par \par \uc2 Neither of those statements are remotely true. In one case, there's an element of truth but the second statement is really wrong.\par \par \uc2 The Facts\par \par \uc2 First, regarding the $24,000, Gosar is referring to the fact that President Obama's executive action shielding about 4 million immigrants from deportation \u8212\'20\'14 currently suspended because of an adverse judicial ruling \u8212\'20\'14 would allow illegal immigrants to receive Social Security numbers. With those numbers, they could file amended tax returns for the last three years claiming the Earned Income Tax Credit. (Gosar called it the "household deferred tax credit," but he meant the EITC.)\par \par \uc2 A Treasury Department spokesman confirmed that such retroactive claims would be possible, but likely would be cumbersome and possibly costly. "Filing original returns for prior years would likely be difficult, since filers would have to reconstruct earnings and other records for years when they were not able to work on the books," the spokesman said. "In addition, in order to claim the EITC, these households would need to report income which may result in them owing taxes."\par \par \uc2 Moreover, Gosar claimed that every illegal would get $24,000, when that is the maximum possible. The Treasury spokesman said few would qualify for that amount: "The maximum credit is only available to taxpayers with three or more children and who are within a specific income range \u8212\'20\'14 only about 12 percent of EITC recipients report having 3 or more children, and many of these individuals have incomes that would not qualify for the maximum credit." (See figure H in this report.)\par \par \uc2 The Fact Checker obviously takes no position on what foes of immigration are calling "amnesty bonuses." But\u160\'00\'A0it should be noted \u8212\'20\'14 as the Associated Press did in an article on the issue \u8212\'20\'14 that illegal immigrants have been paying into Social Security already. \uc2 Stephen Goss\uc2 , the Social Security's chief actuary, told the AP that over the past decade, illegal immigrants have paid $100 billion in Social Security payroll taxes, even though until now they could not hope to claim any benefits after retirement.\par \par \uc2 "The Congressman was implying that each illegal alien family eligible for the tax credit could receive as much as $24,000 in compensation," spokesman Steven Smith said.\par \par \uc2 But Gosar really went off the rails when he claimed that Social Security and other benefits was the second biggest part of Mexico's Gross Domestic Product. It took days to get an answer but Smith said that Gosar was talking about remittances and its impact on the Mexican economy.\par \par \uc2 As Emilly Litella would say, "Never mind."\u160\'00\'A0 That's a big difference. We had not been able to find any evidence that Social Security played much of a role in the Mexican economy, especially since an agreement that would allow Mexicans who have earned benefits to receive them in Mexico has not been ratified by Congress.\par \par \uc2 Even then, remittances\u160\'00\'A0\u8212\'20\'14 transfers of money\u160\'00\'A0by a\u160\'00\'A0foreign worker\u160\'00\'A0to an individual in his or her home country \u8212\'20\'14 are not the second biggest contributor to Mexico's GDP, but just two percent. Indeed, in terms of remittances as a share of GDP, Mexico is in the among Latin American countries.\par \par \uc2 Mexico received $24 billion in remittances in 2014, but according to the \uc2 World Bank\uc2 , that places it fourth in terms of total amount. India received $71 billion in remittances, China $64 billion and the Philippines $28 billion. The \uc2 World Bank\uc2  pays close attention to these numbers because remittances are considered a good thing for a nation's economy; countries with high inflows of remittances are permitted to borrow more.\par \par \uc2 However, Mexico is in first place in terms of remittances from the United States, followed by China, India and the Phillipines. (You can follow the flows with this nifty interactive map from Pew Research Center.)\par \par \uc2 "The point Congressman Gosar was making is that it is overwhelmingly clear that remittances, primarily fueled by income and benefits earned in the United States, are fueling our current immigration crisis in countries like Mexico," Smith said.\par \par \uc2 The Pinocchio Test\par \par \uc2 Lawmakers have an obligation to speak accurately to their constituents.\par \par \uc2 In the first quote, Gosar would have been on more solid ground if he had been clear that he was talking about the maximum that an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  might receive from the EITC \u8212\'20\'14 and that few would qualify to receive this amount. Instead, he portrayed it as a cash payment to every illegal worker covered by Obama's action. Contrary to Smith's explanation, he did not imply anything else \u160\'00\'A0\u8212\'20\'14 and in fact, he asserted "yep, absolutely" when an audience member expressed surprise.\par \par \uc2 In the second statement,\u160\'00\'A0\u160\'00\'A0Gosar suggested that the Mexican economy was being propped up by\u160\'00\'A0Social Security payments, which also is false.\par \par \uc2 Remittances is a different story, and one can certainly have an opinion on whether that fuels immigration, illegal or otherwise. But that's not what Gosar\u160\'00\'A0said. He said that Social Security and other benefits represents the second biggest part of the GDP, when instead he supposedly meant to say that remittances are two percent of \u160\'00\'A0Mexico's GDP.\par \par \uc2 The mistake on the $24,000 is worthy of three Pinocchios, but the other statement earns Gosar\u160\'00\'A0four.\par \par \uc2 Four Pinocchios\par \par \uc2 (About our rating scale)\par \par \uc2 Send us facts to check by filling out this form\par \par \uc2 Follow The Fact Checker on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and friend us on \uc2 Facebook\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020150220eb2k002jp\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Former Maryland governor Martin O'Malley (D) is pulling together an "issues summit" next month, one of several planned gatherings aimed at keeping his supporters engaged as he continues to ponder a long-shot 2016 presidential bid.\par \par \uc2 The March 23 event in Baltimore will bring together "thought leaders," elected officials and key membersof O'Malley's political action committee, according to an e-mail the former governor sent recently to PAC donors.\par \par \uc2 The e-mail said the summit would include a "discussion on translating our policy success in Maryland to the national level." An invitation included in the e-mail cited gun control and immigration issues as examples.\par \par \uc2 Maryland passed one of the strictest gun-control laws in the country in 2013, and voters in 2012 ratified an O'Malley-backed law that grants in-state college tuition rates to \uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2  students in some cases. O'Malley last year was also an outspoken critic of the White House's policies on minors illegally crossing the southern border into the United States.\par \par \uc2 [O'Malley's legacy: liberal successes vs. tax hikes]\par \par \uc2 The progressive Democrat, whose two terms in office ended last month, has also invited supporters to a pair of roundtable dinners. One was scheduled for Wednesday night in Baltimore, the other for Washington in early March. Also next month, he is hosting a "young leaders" happy hour with a St.\u160\'00\'A0Patrick's Day theme.\par \par \uc2 Each event is designed in part to raise money for O'Malley's PAC, which is paying for a modest-size political staff and supporting O'Malley's travel as he continues to weigh a run for the Democratic presidential nomination. A run would be likely to pit him against Hillary Rodham Clinton.\par \par \uc2 O'Malley has said he will probably announce a decision sometime this spring about whether he will run.\par \par \uc2 [O'Malley in wait-and-see mode]\par \par \uc2 Lis Smith, a spokeswoman for the former governor, said the gatherings also are part of an effort by O'Malley to "continue to get together with longtime supporters and advisers, discuss national policy and discuss where he is in terms of his considerations."\par \par \uc2 O'Malley has spent limited time in the public eye in the four weeks since he left office. That is about to change, however, with a burst of travel to early nominating states. He is scheduled to appear in South Carolina this month and New Hampshire next month, and he has a pair of trips to Iowa planned for March and April.\par \par \uc2 The trips are organized around Democratic party dinners and other events. While O'Malley attended dozens of similar gatherings during the last election cycle under the banner of helping other Democrats on the ballot, the focus now will be more squarely on his intentions.\par \par \uc2 A separate e-mail sent this week to O'Malley's PAC donors also listed planned travel to New York this month for what Smith described as "private meetings" and to Chicago next month. Smith said O'Malley plans to participate in the Windy City's St.\u160\'00\'A0Patrick's Day parade.\par \par \uc2 john.wagner@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020150218eb2i002xm\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved   \par \par \uc2 Former Maryland governor Martin O'Malley (D) is hosting an "issues summit" next month, one of several planned gatherings aimed at keeping his supporters engaged as he continues to ponder a long-shot 2016 presidential bid.\par \par \uc2 The March 23 event in Baltimore will bring together "thought leaders," elected officials and key members of O'Malley's political action committee, according to an e-mail the former governor sent recently to PAC donors.\par \par \uc2 The e-mail said the summit would include a "discussion on translating our policy success in Maryland to the national level." An invitation included in the e-mail cited gun control and immigration issues as examples.\par \par \uc2 Maryland passed one of the strictest gun-control laws in the country in 2013, and voters in 2012 ratified an O'Malley-backed law that grants in-state college tuition rates to \uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2  students in some cases. O'Malley last year was also an outspoken critic of the White House's policies on minors illegally crossing the southern border into the United States.\par \par \uc2 [O'Malley's legacy: liberal successes vs. tax hikes]\par \par \uc2 The two-term former governor, whose second term ended last month, also invited supporters to two roundtable dinners. One was scheduled for Wednesday night in Baltimore, the other for Washington in early March. Also next month, he is hosting a "young leaders" happy hour with a St. Patrick's Day theme.\par \par \uc2 Each event is designed in part to raise money for O'Malley's PAC, which is paying for a modest-size political staff and supporting O'Malley's travel as he continues to weigh a run for the Democratic presidential nomination.\par \par \uc2 [O'Malley in wait-and-see mode]\par \par \uc2 O'Malley spokeswoman Lis Smith said the gatherings are also a chance for O'Malley to "continue to get together with longtime supporters and advisers, discuss national policy and discuss where he is in terms of his considerations." O'Malley has said he is likely to announce sometime this spring whether he will run.\par \par \uc2 After four weeks mostly out of public view, O'Malley is about to embark on a burst of travel to early nominating states. He is scheduled to appear in South Carolina this month and New Hampshire next month, and he has a pair of trips to Iowa planned for March and April.\par \par \uc2 The trips are organized around Democratic party dinners and other events. While O'Malley attended dozens of similar gatherings during the last election cycle under the banner of helping other Democrats on the ballot, the focus now will be more squarely on his intentions.\par \par \uc2 A separate e-mail sent this week to O'Malley's PAC donors also listed planned travel to New York this month for what Smith described as "private meetings" and to Chicago next month. Smith said O'Malley plans to participate in the Windy City's St. Patrick's Day parade.\par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com\par \par \uc2 WP20150219omalley0219\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020150219eb2j0001r\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 This post has been updated.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 A fraternity held a party over the weekend with a "border control" theme, according to the Daily Texan, the student newspaper at the \uc2 University of Texas at Austin\uc2 , with several hundred guests wearing sombreros, ponchos, construction workers' reflective vests and hard hats, and military camouflage gear.\par \par \uc2 The student paper reported that the party's theme was described by many of the guests as "border control," but\u160\'00\'A0Andrew Campbell, the president of Phi Gamma Delta, known as Texas Fiji, said in an e-mail that the group's intentions had been misconstrued.\par \par \uc2 "The official theme of the party is Fiji Marshals, an old west themed party that began in the early 1970s. It\u160\'00\'A0has always been a western-themed party.\par \par \uc2 "It is never the intention or goal of any of the members of Texas Fiji or invited guests to portray any racial or ethnic group in a negative manner." He said an e-mail to chapter members indicated that the theme for the party was western, "not south of the border or anything Mexican related," and members had intended to monitor and enforce that to the best of their ability.\par \par \uc2 "If any individual or cultural groups were offended, Texas FIJI apologizes for any insensitivity that our guests or members may have portrayed," Campbell wrote. "\u8230\'20\'26it is never Texas FIJI's intent to alienate or demean any ethnic group."\par \par \uc2 It's a sensitive topic, especially in Texas. The campus bias reporting system has already received complaints about the party, said Erica Saenz, associate vice president for community and external relations at the university, and officials will investigate what happened. "We take these sorts of incidents very seriously," she said. "Theme parties and offensive events do not reflect the value system of our university\u8230\'20\'26 We absolutely do not believe it's a reflection on the majority of our student body."\par \par \uc2 On Monday, a report was released that looked at incidents of bias on campus, said Riley Brands, the editor-in-chief of the Daily Texan, and from 2012 to 2014 there was a more than 700 percent increase in the number of bias reports, mostly because of two events proposed by a student group on campus. One, a "catch an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 " game, never took place.\par \par \uc2 "The university definitely tries to ensure a very inclusive atmosphere for all students," Brands said, "and it does succeed in that in any number of ways. But there's still a dark underbelly that surfaces sometimes in stories like these."\par \par \uc2 Campbell said, "I want to clarify that the members of Fiji are not inherently racist, bigoted, or prejudiced. We do not seek to demean anyone with a theme of a party."\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020150209eb29005xx\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Local-Politics\par {\*\bkmkstart toc4}{\*\bkmkend toc4}\b \uc2 D.C., other cities debate whether legal immigrants should have voting rights; Should noncitizens be allowed to vote? Proposals are being debated in Washington and across the country.\b0\par\par\uc2 By Pamela Constable   \par \uc2 1,422 \uc2 words\par \uc2 10 February 2015\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2015, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 David Nolan and Helen Searls are a professional couple in the District, active in their children's school and local civic associations. As taxpayers and longtime residents, they feel they have a duty to be involved in public life. But as legal immigrants who have not become U.S. citizens, they have no right to vote \u8212\'20\'14 even in local elections.\par \par \uc2 "It's frustrating at election time to have no say in what's happening," said the British-born Searls, 54, who works at a media company. "Washington has people from all over the world. If they are engaged and participating in public issues, it benefits the city."\par \par \uc2 Searls and Nolan are among 54,000 immigrants in the District \u8212\'20\'14 and about 12 million nationwide \u8212\'20\'14 who have been granted green cards that allow them to remain in the United States permanently. Most are sponsored by relatives or employers. They pay taxes and serve in the armed forces. Yet in all but a handful of localities, they have no voting rights.\par \par \uc2 Last month, for the third time in a decade, a bill was introduced in the \uc2 D.C. Council\uc2  to allow legal immigrants to vote locally. The measure has little chance of passage, but it is illustrative of a growing movement to expand local voting rights to noncitizens that has spawned similar proposals in several dozen communities across the country.\par \par \uc2 Most immigrant groups focus on promoting citizenship as the path to political influence, and the effort to enfranchise noncitizens remains controversial. It has succeeded in only a handful of places, including Chicago and Takoma Park, Md., but has been gaining traction recently in others, including New York City and Burlington, Vt., as the population of settled legal immigrants grows.\par \par \uc2 Proponents point out that noncitizen voting was the norm early in American history, when new regions needed people to populate them. It was abandoned only after spates of anti-foreign sentiment in the 1860s and 1920s. Proponents have not urged that immigrants be allowed to vote for president, which is against federal law; they want them to be permitted a political role in their communities.\par \par \uc2 But opponents assert that the right to vote at any level is a defining quality of citizenship. They say it should not be easily granted to the foreign-born, who might have divided loyalties and insufficient knowledge of American democracy. And they point out that any legal permanent resident can apply to become a U.S. citizen with full voting rights after a five-year wait.\par \par \uc2 "To be a voter is to signify that you have cleared hurdles and that you understand what it means to be an American, with responsibilities as well as rights," said Carl Horowitz, president of the National Legal and Policy Center, a conservative think tank in Falls Church, Va. Allowing noncitizens to vote, he said, "renders the idea of citizenship meaningless."\par \par \uc2 Some opponents also think the campaign is part of a political scheme to create more Latino voters, who polls show tend to prefer Democrats \u8212\'20\'14 a concern that has spread with the protracted debate over illegal immigration. The largest numbers of green-card holders are from Mexico, followed by China, India and the Philippines.\par \par \uc2 D.C. Council member David Grosso (I-At Large), who introduced the immigrant voting bill last month, said his attempt in 2013 met with a "huge backlash," and he acknowledged that the new proposal is unlikely to go far. A similar bill in 2004 also died.\par \par \uc2 "This is the right thing to do, but a lot of people still have a misguided understanding of what it's about," Grosso said. "I get e-mails and tweets from around the country saying I want to give the vote to people who snuck over the border."\par \par \uc2 Despite such fears, advocates said the political impact of the noncitizen vote has often been marginal. In many cases, the impetus has come from liberal or civic groups, while the beneficiaries may be less enthusiastic or aware of the benefits.\par \par \uc2 The pioneering community was Takoma Park, which gave legal immigrants voting rights in a 1991 referendum. Sean Whittaker, 46, a Canadian-born engineer who lives there, said that being able to vote made him feel as if he truly belonged in the community. In the town's most recent election, the district candidate he supported won by six votes. "Maybe I made a difference," Whittaker said.\par \par \uc2 Since then, four other Maryland towns have approved similar policies, although noncitizens cannot vote in state elections. In 2012, Del. Patrick L. McDonough (R-Baltimore County) sponsored a bill to ban noncitizens from voting in any Maryland locality, warning hyperbolically that even Osama bin Laden would have been allowed to vote in Takoma Park.\par \par \uc2 But the repercussions from Maryland's experiment have been far from dire. Takoma Park officials say no more than a handful of immigrants have voted in any local election, where turnout is also generally low among citizens, too.\par \par \uc2 "This has not fulfilled either the worst predictions of critics nor the great hopes of supporters," said state Sen. Jamin Raskin (D-Montgomery), a law professor who helped pave the legal path for the initiative. Still, he said, "it has remained an important statement of welcome, a way to give people a taste for the democratic process."\par \par \uc2 Elsewhere in the United States, efforts to enfranchise foreign-born residents have spread to scattered municipalities, including liberal college towns such as Madison, Wis., and Amherst, Mass., and cities with large immigrant populations.\par \par \uc2 But such proposals have also encountered an array of hurdles, including conflicts with state laws, public antipathy and lack of awareness among immigrant groups. In 2010, voters in Portland, Maine, narrowly rejected a proposal for noncitizen voting in local elections, and a ballot measure in San Francisco to allow noncitizen parents to vote for school board members lost by 55 to 45 percent.\par \par \uc2 In Amherst, activist Vladi\u173\'00\'ADmir Morales, who has spent a decade promoting the cause, said the idea has wide local support but continues to meet resistance from state legislators, who would have to amend home-rule laws to allow it.\par \par \uc2 "There is fear. The subject is immigration, and the representatives don't want to touch it. It just keeps dying in committee," said Morales, a U.S. citizen from Puerto Rico and a retired Amherst school board member.\par \par \uc2 In New York, home to about 1.3 million legal permanent residents, noncitizens were allowed to vote in school board elections from 1969 to 2003, when the board system was abolished. In recent years, a coalition of academic, political and immigrant groups has been trying to revive noncitizen voting rights and expand them to all local offices. Advocates said they are close to securing enough city council support to pass legislation this spring, but they lamented that the area's major immigrant groups have not gotten involved.\par \par \uc2 "It's hard to sell," said David Andersson, the coalition coordinator. "Most voters don't understand what legal immigrants are, and a lot of immigrant groups are focused on issues like deportation and wages. Sadly, voting is just not a priority."\par \par \uc2 In the Washington area, few people know about Grosso's proposal and few groups have expressed support, except the \uc2 Service Employees International Union\uc2 . But many of its members are not legal residents, and the union is strongly identified with \uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2  causes.\par \par \uc2 Still, a variety of legal immigrants in the District said they would welcome being able to vote for city council and Board of Education members. Some said they wanted to become citizens but had difficulty passing the required tests in English.\par \par \uc2 At the Central American Resource Center in Northwest Washington, a half-dozen middle-aged Latinos bent over citizenship test workbooks one night last week, struggling with questions that ranged from "What is your current occupation?" to "Why did the colonists come to America?" and "What rights are in the Declaration of Independence?"\par \par \uc2 Maria Carpio, 57, a retired office cleaner from El Salvador, has been a legal resident since 1987. She said she had failed the citizenship test because of her limited eyesight and poor English, but that she volunteered to pass out fliers for a Latino school board candidate in November.\par \par \uc2 "I have worked hard here all my life," Carpio said. "I should have the right to express my opinion."\par \par \uc2 pamela.constable@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020150210eb2a000uo\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved   \par \par \uc2 David Nolan and Helen Searls are a professional couple in the District, active in their children's school and local civic associations. As taxpayers and longtime residents, they feel they have a duty to be involved in public life. But as legal immigrants who have not become U.S. citizens, they have no right to vote - even in local elections.\par \par \uc2 "It's frustrating at election time to have no say in what's happening," said the British-born Searls, 54, who works at a media company. "Washington has people from all over the world. If they are engaged and participating in public issues, it benefits the city."\par \par \uc2 Searls and Nolan are among 54,000 immigrants in the District - and about 12 million nationwide - who have been granted green cards that allow them to remain in the United States permanently. Most are sponsored by relatives or employers. They pay taxes and serve in the armed forces. Yet in all but a handful of localities, they have no voting rights.\par \par \uc2 Last month, for the third time in a decade, a bill was introduced in the \uc2 D.C. Council\uc2  to allow legal immigrants to vote locally. The measure has little chance of passage, but it is illustrative of a growing movement to expand local voting rights to noncitizens that has spawned similar proposals in several dozen communities across the country.\par \par \uc2 Most immigrant groups focus on promoting citizenship as the path to political influence, and the effort to enfranchise noncitizens remains controversial. It has succeeded in only a handful of places, including Chicago and Takoma Park, Md., but has been gaining traction recently in others, including New York City and Burlington, Vt., as the population of settled legal immigrants grows.\par \par \uc2 Proponents point out that noncitizen voting was the norm early in American history, when new regions needed people to populate them. It was abandoned only after spates of anti-foreign sentiment in the 1860s and 1920s. Proponents have not urged that immigrants be allowed to vote for president, which is against federal law; they want them to be permitted a political role in their communities.\par \par \uc2 But opponents assert that the right to vote at any level is a defining quality of citizenship. They say it should not be easily granted to the foreign-born, who might have divided loyalties and insufficient knowledge of American democracy. And they point out that any legal permanent resident can apply to become a U.S. citizen with full voting rights after a five-year wait.\par \par \uc2 "To be a voter is to signify that you have cleared hurdles and that you understand what it means to be an American, with responsibilities as well as rights," said Carl Horowitz, president of the National Legal and Policy Center, a conservative think tank in Falls Church, Va. Allowing noncitizens to vote, he said, "renders the idea of citizenship meaningless."\par \par \uc2 Some opponents also think the campaign is part of a political scheme to create more Latino voters, who polls show tend to prefer Democrats - a concern that has spread with the protracted debate over illegal immigration. The largest numbers of green-card holders are from Mexico, followed by China, India and the Philippines.\par \par \uc2 D.C. Council member David Grosso (I-At Large), who introduced the immigrant voting bill last month, said his attempt in 2013 met with a "huge backlash," and he acknowledged that the new proposal is unlikely to go far. A similar bill in 2004 also died.\par \par \uc2 "This is the right thing to do, but a lot of people still have a misguided understanding of what it's about," Grosso said. "I get e-mails and tweets from around the country saying I want to give the vote to people who snuck over the border."\par \par \uc2 Despite such fears, advocates said the political impact of the noncitizen vote has often been marginal. In many cases, the impetus has come from liberal or civic groups, while the beneficiaries may be less enthusiastic or aware of the benefits.\par \par \uc2 The pioneering community was Takoma Park, which gave legal immigrants voting rights in a 1991 referendum. Sean Whittaker, 46, a Canadian-born engineer who lives there, said that being able to vote made him feel as if he truly belonged in the community. In the town's most recent election, the district candidate he supported won by six votes. "Maybe I made a difference," Whittaker said.\par \par \uc2 Since then, four other Maryland towns have approved similar policies, although noncitizens cannot vote in state elections. In 2012, Del. Patrick L. McDonough (R-Baltimore County) sponsored a bill to ban noncitizens from voting in any Maryland locality, warning hyperbolically that even Osama bin Laden would have been allowed to vote in Takoma Park.\par \par \uc2 But the repercussions from Maryland's experiment have been far from dire. Takoma Park officials say no more than a handful of immigrants have voted in any local election, where turnout is also generally low among citizens, too.\par \par \uc2 "This has not fulfilled either the worst predictions of critics nor the great hopes of supporters," said state Sen. Jamin Raskin (D-Montgomery), a law professor who helped pave the legal path for the initiative. Still, he said, "it has remained an important statement of welcome, a way to give people a taste for the democratic process."\par \par \uc2 Elsewhere in the United States, efforts to enfranchise foreign-born residents have spread to scattered municipalities, including liberal college towns such as Madison, Wis., and Amherst, Mass., and cities with large immigrant populations.\par \par \uc2 But such proposals have also encountered an array of hurdles, including conflicts with state laws, public antipathy and lack of awareness among immigrant groups. In 2010, voters in Portland, Maine, narrowly rejected a proposal for noncitizen voting in local elections, and a ballot measure in San Francisco to allow noncitizen parents to vote for school board members lost by 55 to 45 percent.\par \par \uc2 In Amherst, activist Vladimir Morales, who has spent a decade promoting the cause, said the idea has wide local support but continues to meet resistance from state legislators, who would have to amend home-rule laws to allow it.\par \par \uc2 "There is fear. The subject is immigration, and the representatives don't want to touch it. It just keeps dying in committee," said Morales, a U.S. citizen from Puerto Rico and a retired Amherst school board member.\par \par \uc2 In New York, home to about 1.3 million legal permanent residents, noncitizens were allowed to vote in school board elections from 1969 to 2003, when the board system was abolished. In recent years, a coalition of academic, political and immigrant groups has been trying to revive noncitizen voting rights and expand them to all local offices. Advocates said they are close to securing enough city council support to pass legislation this spring, but they lamented that the area's major immigrant groups have not gotten involved.\par \par \uc2 "It's hard to sell," said David Andersson, the coalition coordinator. "Most voters don't understand what legal immigrants are, and a lot of immigrant groups are focused on issues like deportation and wages. Sadly, voting is just not a priority."\par \par \uc2 In the Washington area, few people know about Grosso's proposal and few groups have expressed support, except the \uc2 Service Employees International Union\uc2 . But many of its members are not legal residents, and the union is strongly identified with \uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2  causes.\par \par \uc2 Still, a variety of legal immigrants in the District said they would welcome being able to vote for city council and Board of Education members. Some said they wanted to become citizens but had difficulty passing the required tests in English.\par \par \uc2 At the Central American Resource Center in Northwest Washington, a half-dozen middle-aged Latinos bent over citizenship test workbooks one night last week, struggling with questions that ranged from "What is your current occupation?" to "Why did the colonists come to America?" and "What rights are in the Declaration of Independence?"\par \par \uc2 Maria Carpio, 57, a retired office cleaner from El Salvador, has been a legal resident since 1987. She said she had failed the citizenship test because of her limited eyesight and poor English, but that she volunteered to pass out fliers for a Latino school board candidate in November.\par \par \uc2 "I have worked hard here all my life," Carpio said. "I should have the right to express my opinion."\par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com\par \par \uc2 WP20150210immigvote0210\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020150210eb2a0001o\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 "I don't think there is any health care professional who has examined the fact, who can honestly say that Americans have not died because of the diseases brought into America by illegal aliens who are not properly healthcare screened as lawful immigrants are. It might be the enterovirus that has a heavy presence in Central and South America that has caused deaths of American children over the past 6 to 9 months. It might be this measles outbreak. There are any number of things."\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.), interview on the Matt Murphy radio show, Feb, 3, 2015\par \par \uc2 CHRIS CUOMO: "Do you believe that what we're seeing with measles coming back again is because of noncompliance by families with their kids and vaccines?"\par \par \uc2 BEN CARSON: "A combination of noncompliance and introduction into our society of people who perhaps haven't been well-screened."\par \par \uc2 CUOMO: "That sounds like code for illegal immigration to me. Is that a point you're trying to make? Are you trying to make the measles situation into an immigration argument?"\par \par \uc2 CARSON: "It's not code and I'm not trying to make it into any particular argument. I'm stating what the facts are."\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 exchange on \uc2 CNN\uc2  , Feb. 4\par \par \uc2 "This is the problem with some of the illegals that are here today. When a refugee comes here from a foreign country, they get a medical assessment and we know their health. But when they are here illegally, they don't get medical assessments. And one thing that we don't want to see is the uptick in hepatitis C, HIV and tuberculosis, but it is here. We are dealing with it. And it is very costly."\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 Maine Gov. Paul LePage (R), State of the State address, Feb. 3\par \par \uc2 One of our colleagues noticed that virtually every \uc2 Washington Post\uc2  article concerning the measles outbreak is followed by comments that link the outbreak to illegal immigration. As it turned out, a number of prominent politicians have suggested that there might be a link \u8212\'20\'14 or that a link cannot be ruled out. (LePage did not mention measles, but suggested there could be in "uptick" in other diseases.)\par \par \uc2 Our friends at PundiFact noted that Rush Limbaugh flat-out declared the outbreak was linked to "our immigration policy," earning the commentator a "Pants on Fire." But the politicians' statements were much more nuanced and careful. What kind of evidence do they have?\par \par \uc2 The Facts\par \par \uc2 There are two key issues. Where is the measles outbreak coming from? And how well screened are illegal immigrants such as unaccompanied children?\par \par \uc2 The 2015 outbreak, mostly centered at \uc2 Disney\uc2  amusement parks in California, is still under investigation, \uc2 Anne Schuchat\uc2 , director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told reporters on Jan. 29\u160\'00\'A0that the "genotype of the virus that's associated with the Disneyland outbreak is causing outbreaks in 14 different countries around the world." She specifically mentioned Indonesia, India and Dubai as possible sources that were under investigation, but she emphasized that "we assume that someone got infected overseas, visited the parks and spread the disease to others."\par \par \uc2 In other words, an American brought the disease back, not that an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  brought it in.\par \par \uc2 The 2014 outbreak was traced to the Philippines, specifically from members of the Amish community in Ohio who had traveled there as missionaries; the community had halted routine vaccinations many years ago after a baby was suspected of getting ill from a shot. In 2014, the Philippines had a measles outbreak, with some 50,000 cases. After the church group came back from the trip, the disease "spread like wildfire" through the community.\par \par \uc2 The\u160\'00\'A0Philippines and India are on a top 10 list of sources of illegal immigrants, but about three-quarters of all illegal immigrants come from just four countries\u160\'00\'A0\u8212\'20\'14 Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. And it turns out that these countries have pretty good records on immunization rates.\par \par \uc2 Here's how the countries compare to the United States over the four most recent years of data, according to the \uc2 World Health Organization\uc2  :\par \par \uc2 United States: 92 percent (2010); 92 (2011); 92 (2012); 91 (2013)\par \par \uc2 Mexico:\u160\'00\'A0 95 (2010); 98 (2011); 99 (2012); 89 (2013)\par \par \uc2 El Salvador: 92 (2010); 89 (2011); 93 (2012); 94 (2013)\par \par \uc2 Guatemala: 93 (2010); 89 (2011); 93 (2012); 85 (2013)\par \par \uc2 Honduras: 98 (2010); 95 (2011); 93 (2012); 89 (2013)\par \par \uc2 As you can see, in most years, the other countries had better vaccination rates than the United States, though there was a sudden decline in 2013 in every country but El Salvador. Still, these are fairly high vaccination rates, making it much less likely that illegal immigrants from these countries are a source of the outbreak.\par \par \uc2 Brooks, in an interview, emphasized that he "never made a statement" that there was a link, just that it was possible. "You can have a lively debate about the most probable source of the outbreak," he said, but he said he has made no judgment about whether illegal immigrants are a source. "I certainly think it is a concern," he added.\par \par \uc2 Brooks acknowledged that the immunization rates in the countries that are the biggest source of illegal immigrants are good, "but anything less than 100 percent immunization" means that there is still a possible link. He pointed to the declines suffered by Mexico, Honduras and Nicaragua in 2013\u8212\'20\'14and also noted that Haiti, another source of illegal immigrants, has only a 65 percent rate.\par \par \uc2 Brooks cited a 2012 CDC report on 212 measles cases in 2011, which showed that 90 percent were associated with importations from other countries. Only 72 cases (36 percent) could be specifically linked to travel to or from overseas; 52 were linked to U.S. residents who had traveled abroad, and 20 were linked to foreign visitors. (France had a major outbreak that year, and 13 cases were traced just to it.) The report does not state whether any of the importations were linked to illegal immigrants; the only cases involving the Americas were from Canada (one) and the Dominican Republic (one).\par \par \uc2 We should note that\u160\'00\'A0CDC's Schuchat said\u160\'00\'A0that in 2014, "79 percent of the unvaccinated cases of measles in the U.S. were unvaccinated due to personal belief exceptions."\u160\'00\'A0\u160\'00\'A0So even if one could trace the source to an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , the main source of the problem is a failure to get vaccinated in the first place.\par \par \uc2 Terry Giles, campaign chairman for the nascent \uc2 Ben Carson\uc2  presidential campaign, emphasized that Carson used the word "perhaps' in his comments. "Non-compliance is anyone who has not been vaccinated," he said in an e-mail.\u160\'00\'A0 "While the unaccompanied children entering the U.S. from Central and Latin America (we have all heard about) are being screened and you have some good information regarding Latin America, we cannot possibly know how many Mexican and other children are crossing the border that are not vaccinated."\par \par \uc2 "Does all of that create a risk \u8212\'20\'14 yes," Giles said. "But does that mean the measles outbreak is an 'immigration' issue \u8212\'20\'14 no. \u160\'00\'A0It may be a another reason we should be sealing our borders \u8212\'20\'14 but the non-vaccination of American children because of misunderstood or misleading information would still create a potential public health issue even if we reduced the flow of illegal immigrants to zero."\par \par \uc2 The CDC has stated that "children arriving at U.S. borders pose little risk of spreading infectious diseases to the general public." The agency says that unaccompanied children may have missed some vaccinations so "as a precaution, ORR [\uc2 Office of Refugee Resettlement\uc2  ] is providing vaccinations to all children who do not have documentation of previous valid doses of vaccine."\par \par \uc2 Lauren Vandiver, spokeswoman for Brooks, provided an\u160\'00\'A0Inspector General report from the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2  that reported that some of the unaccompanied children had spread diseases:\par \par \uc2 DHS employees reported exposure to communicable diseases and becoming sick on duty. For example, during a recent site visit to the Del Rio USBP Station and Del Rio Port of Entry, CBP personnel reported contracting scabies, lice, and chicken pox. Two CBP Officers reported that their children were diagnosed with chicken pox within days of the CBP Officers' contact with a UAC who had chicken pox. In addition, USBP personnel at the Clint Station and Santa Teresa Station reported that they were potentially exposed to tuberculosis.\par \par \uc2 (LePage's office did not respond to queries.)\par \par \uc2 The Pinocchio Test\par \par \uc2 Unlike Limbaugh, Brooks and Carson did not draw a direct link between illegal immigration and the measles outbreak; they merely suggested it is a possibility. But it's a tricky balance, given that thus far the CDC has not traced this most recent outbreak \u8212\'20\'14 or previous ones \u8212\'20\'14 to illegal immigration. One cannot have 100 percent certainty in life, and so that always leaves open the possibility of a link.\par \par \uc2 Brooks' comments were stronger, even suggesting the possibility of deaths, while Carson's remarks were relatively nuanced. To some extent, this falls in the realm of opinion. And certainly if the link had been as clearly stated as Limbaugh, this would have resulted in more Pinocchios.\par \par \uc2 Nevertheless,\u160\'00\'A0when raising the possibility that illegal immigration could spread disease, politicians also have an obligation to note that the evidence of any such link, thus far, is rather slim or even nonexistent.\par \par \uc2 Two Pinocchios\par \par \uc2 (About our rating scale)\par \par \uc2 Send us facts to check by filling out this form\par \par \uc2 Follow The Fact Checker on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and friend us on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and friend us on \par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020150206eb2600231\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 A ranked selection of notable new recordings we heard in January.\par \par \uc2 1. Bjork, "Vulnicura"\par \par \uc2 Bjork's superpower: Delivering highly abstract vocalizations that simultaneously obey specific feelings, melodies and lyrics. Another one: Mapping out the margins of human emotion like a cosmonaut cartographer (who might actually be lost). Another one: Making existential dread feel like raw beauty. Another one: Reminding us that to be alone is to be alive.\par \par \uc2 2. Jessica Pratt, "On Your Own Love Again"\par \par \uc2 A lullaby has strange and magical responsibilities \u8212\'20\'14 it's a song designed to guide the listener safely across a state of blurred consciousness. So when duty calls this California singer on her superb second album, she uses a willowy voice and an acoustic guitar to ferry us between wakefulness and dreamtime with magnetic strangeness and maximum magic.\par \par \uc2 3. Rae Sremmurd, "SremmLife"\par \par \uc2 From the young rap duo who brought us the twin joy-spasms of "No Flex Zone" and "No Type" comes a debut album that's either a gurgling fountain of sonic caffeine or the actual fountain of youth.\par \par \uc2 WARNING: Some of the songs streaming below contain explicit lyrics.\par \par \uc2 4. Obnox, "Boogalou Reed"\par \par \uc2 Frontman Bim Thomas likes his jokes as dirty as his guitar riffs, but one of the zingiest zingers on this ripping new batch of Obnox tunes assumes the shape of metaphysical trash talk: "Got my third eye open! I'm watching you!"\par \par \uc2 5. Jazmine Sullivan, "Reality Show"\par \par \uc2 There's a distinctive fed-up-ness to this R&B singer's third album, a frustration that often refuses to erupt into falsetto shrieks of annoyance. Sullivan sounds most comfortable airing her grievances in her lower register. The truth is at the bottom.\par \par \uc2 6. RJ and Choice, "Rich Off Mackin'"\par \par \uc2 At this point, could a Yellow Pages recitation over a DJ Mustard beat crack the top 40? We're getting close. On this sterling new mixtape, Mustard's somewhat unremarkable new acolytes sound practically infallible rapping over the maestro's exquisite boom-clap.\par \par \uc2 7. Turnstile, "Nonstop Feeling"\par \par \uc2 As if conjured from the brittle pages of a mid-'90s skateboard magazine, this local hardcore group reanimates the knuckle-headed corpse of goofy, gonzo punk-funk in a smart, sincere way. (Someone in this band also digs the Pixies.)\par \par \uc2 8. Panda Bear, "Panda Bear Meets the Grim Reaper"\par \par \uc2 As Noah Lennox hones his original brand of difficult psychedelia, his music continues to feel deliriously conflicted \u8212\'20\'14 like trippy drudgery, like hard labor in a colorful dream, like working on the chain gang on psilocybin \u8212\'20\'14 and there's always a nice melody to hum along to.\par \par \uc2 9. Zuse, "\uc2 Illegal Immigrant\uc2 "\par \par \uc2 As hip-hop's epicenter and Xanadu, Atlanta continues to generate a cacophony of disparate voices, but this Jamaican-born rapper's accent isn't the only thing that sets him apart in the Georgia din. He sounds hungry, literally, as if he's trying to devour his own syllables.\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14\par \par \uc2 Read more of the month's best music:\par \par \uc2 - The month's best music \u8212\'20\'14 February 2014\par \par \uc2 - The month's best music \u8212\'20\'14 March 2014\par \par \uc2 - The month's best music \u8212\'20\'14 April 2014\par \par \uc2 - The month's best music \u8212\'20\'14 May 2014\par \par \uc2 - The month's best music \u8212\'20\'14 June 2014\par \par \uc2 - The month's best music \u8212\'20\'14 July 2014\par \par \uc2 - The month's best music \u8212\'20\'14 August 2014\par \par \uc2 - The month's best music \u8212\'20\'14 September 2014\par \par \uc2 - The month's best music \u8212\'20\'14 October 2014\par \par \uc2 - The month's best music \u8212\'20\'14 November 2014\par \par \uc2 - The month's best music \u8212\'20\'14 December 2014\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020150128eb1s0093v\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 A ranked selection of notable new recordings we heard in January.\par \par \uc2 1. Bjork, "Vulnicura"\par \par \uc2 Bjork's superpower: Delivering highly abstract vocalizations that simultaneously obey specific feelings, melodies and lyrics. Another one: Mapping out the margins of human emotion like a cosmonaut cartographer (who might actually be lost). Another one: Making existential dread feel like raw beauty. Another one: Reminding us that to be alone is to be alive.\par \par \uc2 2. Jessica Pratt, "On Your Own Love Again"\par \par \uc2 A lullaby has strange and magical responsibilities \u8212\'20\'14 it's a song designed to guide the listener safely across a state of blurred consciousness. So when duty calls this California singer on her superb second album, she uses a willowy voice and an acoustic guitar to ferry us between wakefulness and dreamtime with magnetic strangeness and maximum magic.\par \par \uc2 3. Rae Sremmurd, "SremmLife"\par \par \uc2 From the young rap duo who brought us the twin joy-spasms of "No Flex Zone" and "No Type" comes a debut album that's either a gurgling fountain of sonic caffeine or the actual fountain of youth.\par \par \uc2 WARNING: Some of the songs streaming below contain explicit lyrics.\par \par \uc2 4. Obnox, "Boogalou Reed"\par \par \uc2 Frontman Bim Thomas likes his jokes as dirty as his guitar riffs, but one of the zingiest zingers on this ripping new batch of Obnox tunes assumes the shape of metaphysical trash talk: "Got my third eye open! I'm watching you!"\par \par \uc2 5. Jazmine Sullivan, "Reality Show"\par \par \uc2 There's a distinctive fed-up-ness to this R&B singer's third album, a frustration that often refuses to erupt into falsetto shrieks of annoyance. Sullivan sounds most comfortable airing her grievances in her lower register. The truth is at the bottom.\par \par \uc2 6. RJ and Choice, "Rich Off Mackin'"\par \par \uc2 At this point, could a Yellow Pages recitation over a DJ Mustard beat crack the top 40? We're getting close. On this sterling new mixtape, Mustard's somewhat unremarkable new acolytes sound practically infallible rapping over the maestro's exquisite boom-clap.\par \par \uc2 7. Turnstile, "Nonstop Feeling"\par \par \uc2 As if conjured from the brittle pages of a mid-'90s skateboard magazine, this local hardcore group reanimates the knuckle-headed corpse of goofy, gonzo punk-funk in a smart, sincere way. (Someone in this band also digs the Pixies.)\par \par \uc2 8. Panda Bear, "Panda Bear Meets the Grim Reaper"\par \par \uc2 As Noah Lennox hones his original brand of difficult psychedelia, his music continues to feel deliriously conflicted \u8212\'20\'14 like trippy drudgery, like hard labor in a colorful dream, like working on the chain gang on psilocybin \u8212\'20\'14 and there's always a nice melody to hum along to.\par \par \uc2 9. Zuse, "\uc2 Illegal Immigrant\uc2 "\par \par \uc2 As hip-hop's epicenter and Xanadu, Atlanta continues to generate a cacophony of disparate voices, but this Jamaican-born rapper's accent isn't the only thing that sets him apart in the Georgia din. He sounds hungry, literally, as if he's trying to devour his own syllables.\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14\par \par \uc2 Read more of the month's best music:\par \par \uc2 - The month's best music \u8212\'20\'14 February 2014\par \par \uc2 - The month's best music \u8212\'20\'14 March 2014\par \par \uc2 - The month's best music \u8212\'20\'14 April 2014\par \par \uc2 - The month's best music \u8212\'20\'14 May 2014\par \par \uc2 - The month's best music \u8212\'20\'14 June 2014\par \par \uc2 - The month's best music \u8212\'20\'14 July 2014\par \par \uc2 - The month's best music \u8212\'20\'14 August 2014\par \par \uc2 - The month's best music \u8212\'20\'14 September 2014\par \par \uc2 - The month's best music \u8212\'20\'14 October 2014\par \par \uc2 - The month's best music \u8212\'20\'14 November 2014\par \par \uc2 - The month's best music \u8212\'20\'14 December 2014\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020150127eb1r006vb\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

Attorney General Karl Racine takes sides in Obama immigration fight\b0\par\par\uc2 By Mike DeBonis   \par \uc2 300 \uc2 words\par \uc2 13 January 2015\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2015, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Ordinarily, President Obama's November decision to grant legal status to millions of illegal immigrants through executive order would have exactly zero bearing on D.C. politics. The District's elected officials are almost uniformly Obama supporters and they have long supported policies making the city more hospitable to the undocumented.\par \par \uc2 But thanks to the District's newly inaugurated attorney general, the D.C. government is taking sides in the brewing fight between the Obama administration and those, mainly Republicans, who are seeking to block the president's actions.\par \par \uc2 Attorney General Karl A. Racine announced Monday the District has joined 12 states, led by Washington and California, that are supporting the Obama administration in a federal lawsuit brought by Texas and more than 20 other states seeking to overturn the executive order.\par \par \uc2 Obama's action would grant a temporary reprieve from possible deportation for more than 4 million people living in the U.S. who do not have legal residency status, most of them the parents of American citizens. It is unclear how many D.C. residents would be affected by the Obama order; a \uc2 Pew Hispanic Center\uc2  report estimated the District's \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  population stood at around 25,000 in 2010.\par \par \uc2 The brief co-signed by Racine argues that Obama's order "will substantially benefit states, will further the public interest, and are well within the President's broad authority to enforce immigration law."\par \par \uc2 Racine \u8212\'20\'14 himself an immigrant, who came with his family to America from Haiti as a young child \u8212\'20\'14 said in a statement that he is "proud to support the President's wise and lawful actions here to protect our immigrant families in the District and throughout the country."\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020150113eb1d004sa\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

Attorney General Karl Racine takes sides in Obama immigration fight \b0\par\par\uc2 By Mike DeBonis   \par \uc2 300 \uc2 words\par \uc2 13 January 2015\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2015, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Ordinarily, President Obama's November decision to grant legal status to millions of illegal immigrants through executive order would have exactly zero bearing on D.C. politics. The District's elected officials are almost uniformly Obama supporters and they have long supported policies making the city more hospitable to the undocumented.\par \par \uc2 But thanks to the District's newly inaugurated attorney general, the D.C. government is taking sides in the brewing fight between the Obama administration and those, mainly Republicans, who are seeking to block the president's actions.\par \par \uc2 Attorney General Karl A. Racine announced Monday the District has joined 12 states, led by Washington and California, that are supporting the Obama administration in a federal lawsuit brought by Texas and more than 20 other states seeking to overturn the executive order.\par \par \uc2 Obama's action would grant a temporary reprieve from possible deportation for more than 4 million people living in the U.S. who do not have legal residency status, most of them the parents of American citizens. It is unclear how many D.C. residents would be affected by the Obama order; a \uc2 Pew Hispanic Center\uc2  report estimated the District's \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  population stood at around 25,000 in 2010.\par \par \uc2 The brief co-signed by Racine argues that Obama's order "will substantially benefit states, will further the public interest, and are well within the President's broad authority to enforce immigration law."\par \par \uc2 Racine \u8212\'20\'14 himself an immigrant, who came with his family to America from Haiti as a young child \u8212\'20\'14 said in a statement that he is "proud to support the President's wise and lawful actions here to protect our immigrant families in the District and throughout the country."\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020150113eb1d0048t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Their TV was showing another rally celebrating President Obama's long-awaited announcement about immigration reform, but to Marilu Morales it just sounded like more white noise. "Gracias a Presidente Obama!" shouted an anchor on Univision, as Marilu, 29, returned home near dawn after another midnight shift and collapsed onto the couch. Lately, she needed the sound of a TV to help her sleep. She needed Tylenol, blackout curtains and anything else that could numb what her life had become in the 10 weeks since her husband, Javier Flores, was deported.\par \par \uc2 Her four children were already awake and getting ready for school \u8212\'20\'14 the 4-year-old dressing the 1-year-old in shorts and mismatched sneakers; the 10-year-old helping the 8-year-old with the last of her math homework. They watched cartoons and ate leftover pizza. They packed their backpacks and let their mother rest until exactly 7:30 a.m., just like Marilu had asked them to do. Then they climbed onto the couch and began trying to rouse her.\par \par \uc2 "We have to go," said Rocio, 8. "Come on. Get up. You said we couldn't be late again."\par \par \uc2 "Okay," Marilu said, her eyes still half closed. "I just got back from work. I need a few more minutes."\par \par \uc2 They had been late to school 17 times in the past few months, an unraveling that began when Javier was pulled over with expired tags on his way home from work, detained and sent back to Mexico with only the clothes he was wearing. Soon after that, Marilu had started arriving late to her job at a window factory because she was caring for the children alone, leading to her demotion to a longer, overnight shift. Next, exhausted after work, she began sleeping through the drop-off time at her children's school. Then, without Javier's salary, she had failed to pay rent on their suburban house, so they had moved into a friend's cramped apartment, where all five of them slept in one room.\par \par \uc2 "Mom, seriously, wake up!" Rocio said again, louder this time. School started in 10\u160\'00\'A0minutes. The drive took 15. "Please," Rocio said, but Marilu waved her away.\par \par \uc2 The apartment was decorated with balloons and streamers left over from two weeks before, when Marilu had hosted a few friends to watch Obama announce the specifics of his executive action on immigration. "Finally!" she had written to Javier earlier that day, as he also prepared to watch from his new home after 13 years in Ohio, an open-air hut surrounded by the lime groves of southern Mexico. They listened as Obama said it was cruel to separate children from their parents. They heard him say America was in the business of keeping families together.\par \par \uc2 "It's time to draw the line," Obama had said, explaining which illegal immigrants could apply for legal status and which ones could not \u8212\'20\'14 and then he drew a line that ran right through their family and nearly a million others like it, ones already separated by recent deportations.\par \par \uc2 Under Obama's executive action, Javier, who would have qualified for relief if only it had come 10\u160\'00\'A0weeks earlier, would instead be stuck in Mexico. Their children, all American citizens, could only live with both parents by joining him in a town of 900 near the Guatemalan border. And Marilu, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who under Obama's plan was suddenly secure in the U.S. for the first time in 13 years, had begun wondering if now was the time to leave.\par \par \uc2 "You are almost an American!" Javier had written to Marilu that night, after Obama's announcement, trying to be hopeful.\par \par \uc2 "Maybe it's better to be Mexican," she had responded. "Every day here is a mess without you."\par \par \uc2 Now, on this messy day, Rocio jumped on the couch and shook her mother's shoulders. "School!" she said, and finally Marilu got up. She put on slippers and grabbed her car keys. School already had started. Her children would be late for the 18th time \u8212\'20\'14 another failure in the country that Marilu believed was offering to improve her life while simultaneously ruining it.\par \par \uc2 Obama had made his decision. Now she needed to make hers. Stay or go?\par \par \uc2 "Hurry," she said, and she rushed the children into the car and drove to school.\par \par \uc2 The waiting game\par \par \uc2 Her 13 years in the United States had unfolded in a series of emergencies she had somehow managed to solve. So surely, she thought, there was a way out of this, too. "We need a reason to hope," she wrote to Javier, one night, and then she skipped work to attend a community meeting about Obama's plan, expecting to find a solution embedded in the details. She brought all four children to a church basement and sat in the back row. Edwin, 10, took brochures off an entry table and folded them into paper airplanes. Heidi, 4, ran circles around the room. Marilu took out a notebook and a pen. "Possibilities," she wrote, and then waited to hear what they might be.\par \par \uc2 The event had been organized by Marilu's friend, a local immigration activist named Veronica Dahlberg, who began by sharing what she considered welcome news: Parents of children who were born in the U.S. could stay and work. Up to 5\u160\'00\'A0million illegal residents qualified for relief. "This is progress!" she told the group, but before she could finish, people began raising their hands.\par \par \uc2 "So, does this make us citizens?" one asked.\par \par \uc2 "No, not exactly," Dahlberg said.\par \par \uc2 "Is it permanent?" another asked. "We can be here for good?"\par \par \uc2 "No," Dahlberg said. "It lasts for three years."\par \par \uc2 "Then what?" said a man in front. "We give the government our information, and then in three years they can use it to find and deport us?"\par \par \uc2 A few people clapped in agreement, a few others stood to ask more questions, and soon the church was so loud that Marilu couldn't hear Dahlberg. She thought about all the other times when it seemed like her life in the United States had reached a dead end. She had grown up in Chiapas, the poorest state in Mexico, and left for the U.S. at 15 with the first person who would take her, a man she recalled as being twice her age who began abusing her after they made it to Akron. She had been too afraid to report him to the police, so she lived for a year in a house run by nuns. She had moved a dozen times in the next decade, from one cash-only apartment to the next, worried that signing her name to a lease might lead to her deportation. She had lost her work authorization papers and found a co-worker to fudge new ones. She had lost her ride to the factory and summoned the courage to ask a co-worker to teach her how to drive without a license. This was Javier, and he had taken Marilu to drive circles around a \uc2 Wal-Mart\uc2  parking lot until one day he said she was ready to drive home.\par \par \uc2 For as long as she could remember, hers had been a hidden life: Always some new problem. Always some solution that came just in time.\par \par \uc2 She stood up from her seat and walked to the front of the meeting with Mia, the 1-year-old, in her arms. The room was still loud. Dahlberg saw Marilu and tried to introduce her to the group. Marilu turned away from the room and started asking questions of her own.\par \par \uc2 "What about people who were already deported?" she asked, still carrying the notebook, still waiting to write down the first possibility. "Can they come back?"\par \par \uc2 "I'm sorry. Not yet," Dahlberg said.\par \par \uc2 "But Javier has only been gone two months."\par \par \uc2 "I know."\par \par \uc2 "He was good. He was perfect. He would have qualified."\par \par \uc2 "I know," Dahlberg said again.\par \par \uc2 The room had quieted, and people were watching them now. A man handed Marilu a tissue. She looked at the floor and tried not to cry.\par \par \uc2 "Please," she told Dahlberg. "Tell me something good."\par \par \uc2 Dahlberg had been helping immigrants for 30\u160\'00\'A0years, and she still felt unsure of how to deal with the issue of hope. What constituted optimism and what was a lie? Was it best to give Marilu some small amount of belief \u8212\'20\'14 enough to bolster her up, to keep her functioning? Or was it better to say the truth: that Obama was promising to strengthen enforcement on the border, and Javier's return to the U.S. seemed at best unlikely and at worst impossible; that it could take months, or even years, to sort through the possibilities; that Marilu's best chance to reunite her family quickly was to collect passports for the children and buy plane tickets south.\par \par \uc2 "Maybe we can still find some way to push," Dahlberg said. "Can you hold out for another six months?"\par \par \uc2 "Six months?" Marilu said. Mia started to cry. She tried rocking her. "No. I don't think so."\par \par \uc2 "Three months?"\par \par \uc2 "No."\par \par \uc2 "How long can you manage?" Dahlberg asked.\par \par \uc2 "Maybe a month," Marilu said. "A week. I'm losing my mind. I don't know."\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18There\u8217\'20\'19s nothing for you\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 A few days later, she received another voice mail from the principal at St. Mary's Catholic School.\par \par \uc2 "Mrs. Morales, I'm very sorry, but things can't go on like this," the principal said. "We are worried about your children. Edwin is being disruptive again. We need you to talk to him."\par \par \uc2 Marilu replayed the message as she made the 15-minute drive across town to the school. She had trouble with English, having relied for too long on Javier as her translator, but she understood enough to know this call was bad. She phoned Javier from the car, reaching him on the scratchy landline in the open-air house he shared with a dozen relatives. He had just gotten back from nine hours in the lime fields, clearing the ground with a machete, saving another $3 from his pay so that maybe, one day, he could give $8,000 to a smuggler, hike five days across the desert, bus to Ohio and reunite with his children.\par \par \uc2 "Is everything okay?" he asked Marilu. Lately, he was always worried; he reminded her each morning to sign the children up for free school meals and to give Edwin his medication.\par \par \uc2 "They don't listen anymore," Marilu told him now. "Not to me, not to their teachers."\par \par \uc2 Marilu had long considered St. Mary's the best reason to stay in Akron. For $100 each year in subsidized tuition, the school had turned Rocio and Edwin into prayerful Catholics and capable students. Rocio was two years ahead in math. Edwin's artwork was displayed in the halls. Their classmates had introduced them to \uc2 Disney\uc2 , the \uc2 NFL\uc2 , hand-clapping games and Thanksgiving. It was St. Mary's, Marilu believed, that had turned her children into true Americans \u8212\'20\'14 assertive and self-assured, better at speaking English than Spanish. In the aftermath of Javier's deportation, teachers had offered her children free breakfast, coats, aftercare and counseling. The clergy had prayed for Javier's return. "A miracle school," Marilu called it. But now the school's relationship with her consisted mainly of these phone messages, at least a dozen saved on her cellphone, the narrative of a family trauma.\par \par \uc2 "Mrs. Morales, I can't stress this enough, it really is important to arrive at school on time," the principal had said, one week after Javier was deported.\par \par \uc2 "Edwin has been refusing to sit down in his class," he had said, a few weeks later.\par \par \uc2 "We know this is a difficult time, but these are serious issues of classroom obedience," he had said, a few days after that.\par \par \uc2 "I'm sorry, but Edwin is down to his last chance," he had said, in his next message.\par \par \uc2 "We are relying on you to get through to him," he was saying now, in this latest message. "You need to come up with a plan."\par \par \uc2 Marilu pulled up to the school, where Edwin and Rocio were waiting out front. "I'm not happy," she told them, and they drove home in silence. Edwin ran into the house and went to his bedroom to grab a video game. "No way," Marilu said, taking it from him. Rocio turned on the TV, and Marilu turned it off. She gathered all four of her children on the couch and stared at them. "I don't know what to say," she said. She was furious with them and heartbroken for them and exhausted by them. "You are making me crazy," she said.\par \par \uc2 They had each rebelled in their own ways since Javier's deportation, but the one Marilu worried about most was Rocio, 8, because until recently there had been no reason to worry about her at all. "One of our best," her teacher had written, in an evaluation weeks before Javier's deportation. St. Mary's awarded its top students with a currency called Dino Bucks, and at the beginning of the school year Rocio had earned the most in the second grade \u8212\'20\'14 42, a testament to high achievement, a mark of status within the school. But students who arrived late were docked two Dino Bucks, and now Rocio was often late, so she began her days by reluctantly handing over some of what she'd earned. "You are ruining everything!" Rocio had screamed at her mother, once, and then one day at school she had seen a few actual dollars sitting on a classmate's desk and decided to take them. "Stealing," the teacher had written in a note home to Marilu, and so Rocio had been suspended for the first time in her life. Marilu had punished her by forcing her to stare at a wall in their apartment, but instead Rocio had kicked her foot right through it, creating a gaping hole. Now the friends who had been kind enough to let them stay in the apartment were suggesting it might be time to move out.\par \par \uc2 "I am tired of apologizing for all of you," Marilu said, sitting across the couch from her children. She told them she was taking away TV and \uc2 Nintendo\uc2 . She was locking up the snacks. "You need to do better or you won't have a school or a house," she said. "We'll have no place to go."\par \par \uc2 "Good," Rocio said, glaring back at her. "Let's leave. I hate it here. I want to go to Mexico."\par \par \uc2 "Me too," Heidi said.\par \par \uc2 "You don't know anything about Mexico," Marilu said, thinking about the future that awaited them in Javier's village, where public school ended in ninth grade and the few jobs available paid $10 a day. The boys would pick limes. The girls would grind corn and make tortillas over a wood stove. "There's nothing for you," she said.\par \par \uc2 "I want to live with Dad," Rocio said.\par \par \uc2 "Me too," Heidi said again.\par \par \uc2 "He told me he has to bathe in a river," Edwin said. "I'm never doing that. I'm waiting for him to come back."\par \par \uc2 "He can't right now," Marilu said. "He wants to. He loves you. But he can't."\par \par \uc2 Rocio looked at her mother and started to cry. "But you said he was coming back in a little while," she said. "When is he coming?"\par \par \uc2 "I don't know," Marilu said.\par \par \uc2 "You lied," Rocio said.\par \par \uc2 Marilu reached out to hug her. "I want him, too," she said, and she crammed next to her children on the couch. She had to leave for work in an hour, and the children would be alone until her friends came over to watch them. She turned on the TV. She got out the snacks. She handed Edwin his \uc2 Nintendo\uc2 . "I'm sorry," she said.\par \par \uc2 Getting by\par \par \uc2 She got up from the couch to cook dinner. She drove to the factory and worked a 10-hour shift. She came home, fed the baby, did the dinner dishes and then slept in her work clothes for two hours on the couch. At 7 a.m., a phone call woke her up. It was Javier, calling like he did three times every day.\par \par \uc2 "Did you remember?" he asked.\par \par \uc2 "Of course," she lied, sitting up on the couch, trying to think of what she was forgetting.\par \par \uc2 "My birthday," he said.\par \par \uc2 "Thirty-one," she said.\par \par \uc2 "Thirty-two," he said. "Are you taking the day off work?"\par \par \uc2 "Yes," she lied again.\par \par \uc2 It had been one of their traditions in seven years together: Whenever someone in the family had a birthday, both Javier and Marilu requested the day off. They both had worked 12-hour shifts at the window factory, six days each week on opposite schedules to avoid paying for child care. They had never had time or money to take vacations together, so birthdays had become their mini-vacations. Marilu liked to take the children to restaurants and movies. Javier always chose the zoo.\par \par \uc2 Now it had been a month since Marilu had so much as taken the children outside to a playground. Heidi was going stir-crazy and sometimes drawing on the walls. Rocio kept asking to go for a walk. They had lived in the new apartment for two months, but already Marilu resented every corner of it: the clothes spilling all over the bedroom since it lacked a closet; the stove that would never turn on and the kitchen faucet that would never turn off. "Can we please go somewhere?" Heidi kept asking, and Marilu wanted to, but it was winter, and she was working, and she was tired, and their new neighborhood consisted mostly of boarded-up houses and unlit streets.\par \par \uc2 "I can't take them anywhere by myself, not all four," she told Javier now. "We sit. We wait. We don't do anything."\par \par \uc2 "That's not true," Javier said.\par \par \uc2 "It's different now," she told him.\par \par \uc2 "Then what can we do?" he asked.\par \par \uc2 Marilu wasn't ready to tell him about the list she had been making, comparing Mexico to the United States. America was better for the children, she had decided \u8212\'20\'14 safer, nicer, richer, better schools. But she couldn't manage it without a co-parent, someone with whom to split bills and child care. A few times, she had dressed up for community meetings where she knew there would be men, layering her eyes with makeup, streaking her dark hair with blond highlights. Two co-workers had asked her to dinner and a man from church had invited her over, but each time she had declined. As much as she needed someone, she had decided, she needed Javier more. He was the first man she had loved \u8212\'20\'14 not just a caretaker but also a father and a husband.\par \par \uc2 "We're stuck," she told him.\par \par \uc2 "I know," he said.\par \par \uc2 The decision\par \par \uc2 "America!" the Univision anchor was shouting early one day. "Finally, we can act like real people! We don't have to hide! We can live!" and something about the way he said it cut through the white noise of another disastrous morning and lifted Marilu off the couch. She made herself coffee. She showered. She got Edwin and Rocio to school on time. She took the baby to a park. She came home and called Javier: "I feel good," she told him, because it was true. On this day at least, she knew what she wanted to do.\par \par \uc2 She met with Dahlberg, her friend and the immigration activist, and for once she drove through downtown Akron without fixating on the speed limit. She passed the police station and didn't feel nervous. She saw a building adorned with American flags and official government seals and, instead of avoiding it, steered into the parking lot. She walked up the stairs into Akron's central post office and approached the main counter. Dahlberg came to translate.\par \par \uc2 "I'm hoping to get passports for my children," Marilu said, when she reached the front of the line.\par \par \uc2 "When are you traveling?" the employee asked.\par \par \uc2 "Soon," Marilu said. She explained that none of her four children had travel documents. She hoped to get them right away.\par \par \uc2 "Okay," the employee said. "If they are under 16, both parents will need to be present."\par \par \uc2 "That's not possible," Marilu said.\par \par \uc2 "Then we will need a copy of both parents' driver's licenses."\par \par \uc2 "We don't have those," Marilu said.\par \par \uc2 "Then we will need certified consent from the other parent," the employee said, and Marilu stepped away from the counter and let Dahlberg take over. Dahlberg spoke to the employee, collected a stack of forms and translated for Marilu on their way back out to the car.\par \par \uc2 "This won't be easy," Dahlberg said, beginning to explain what it would take for this illegal resident of the United States to leave. First, Marilu would need to send Javier a stack of forms in Mexico, even though his village had no mail delivery. He would need to sign those forms, and to somehow get them notarized, and to somehow send them back to the United States. Marilu would need to secure her own travel documents, which meant tracking down her birth certificate in Chiapas and bringing it to the Mexican Consulate in Detroit. Then she would need to pay for the children's passport photos ($20 each) and for the processing of their paperwork ($105 each) and for their plane tickets ($1,200 each). And then, if all went well, they would be on their way to Javier's village, where there was no house for them, no beds, no running water, no English-speaking teachers and no jobs.\par \par \uc2 "Okay," Marilu said. "I can do this."\par \par \uc2 Her mind would change again and again during the next days, but for now she drove home from the post office feeling certain enough to begin the paperwork. There were forms for each child, and she studied the questions and considered the answers.\par \par \uc2 Place of birth: "USA," she said.\par \par \uc2 Citizenship: "USA."\par \par \uc2 Country of residence: "USA."\par \par \uc2 "Please explain in detail the reason for your request," one question asked, and her mind flooded with so many possible answers: bad timing, money, politics, family, Rocio, Edwin, Heidi, Mia.\par \par \uc2 In the America where President Obama had suddenly given her options, one seemed like the best.\par \par \uc2 "We need to leave," she said.\par \par \uc2 eli.saslow@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020141221eacl000um\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Their TV was showing another rally celebrating President Obama's long-awaited announcement about immigration reform, but to Marilu Morales it just sounded like more white noise. "Gracias a Presidente Obama!" shouted an anchor on Univision, as Marilu, 29, returned home near dawn after another midnight shift and collapsed onto the couch. Lately, she needed the sound of a TV to help her sleep. She needed Tylenol, blackout curtains and anything else that could numb what her life had become in the 10 weeks since her husband, Javier Flores, was deported.\par \par \uc2 Her four children were already awake and getting ready for school \u8212\'20\'14 the 4-year-old dressing the 1-year-old in shorts and mismatched sneakers; the 10-year-old helping the 8-year-old with the last of her math homework. They watched cartoons and ate leftover pizza. They packed their backpacks and let their mother rest until exactly 7:30 a.m., just like Marilu had asked them to do. Then they climbed onto the couch and began trying to rouse her.\par \par \uc2 "We have to go," said Rocio, 8. "Come on. Get up. You said we couldn't be late again."\par \par \uc2 "Okay," Marilu said, her eyes still half closed. "I just got back from work. I need a few more minutes."\par \par \uc2 They had been late to school 17 times in the past few months, an unraveling that began when Javier was pulled over with expired tags on his way home from work, detained and sent back to Mexico with only the clothes he was wearing. Soon after that, Marilu had started arriving late to her job at a window factory because she was caring for the children alone, leading to her demotion to a longer, overnight shift. Next, exhausted after work, she began sleeping through the drop-off time at her children's school. Then, without Javier's salary, she had failed to pay rent on their suburban house, so they had moved into a friend's cramped apartment, where all five of them slept in one room.\par \par \uc2 "Mom, seriously, wake up!" Rocio said again, louder this time. School started in 10\u160\'00\'A0minutes. The drive took 15. "Please," Rocio said, but Marilu waved her away.\par \par \uc2 The apartment was decorated with balloons and streamers left over from two weeks before, when Marilu had hosted a few friends to watch Obama announce the specifics of his executive action on immigration. "Finally!" she had written to Javier earlier that day, as he also prepared to watch from his new home after 13 years in Ohio, an open-air hut surrounded by the lime groves of southern Mexico. They listened as Obama said it was cruel to separate children from their parents. They heard him say America was in the business of keeping families together.\par \par \uc2 "It's time to draw the line," Obama had said, explaining which illegal immigrants could apply for legal status and which ones could not \u8212\'20\'14 and then he drew a line that ran right through their family and nearly a million others like it, ones already separated by recent deportations.\par \par \uc2 Under Obama's executive action, Javier, who would have qualified for relief if only it had come 10\u160\'00\'A0weeks earlier, would instead be stuck in Mexico. Their children, all American citizens, could only live with both parents by joining him in a town of 900 near the Guatemalan border. And Marilu, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who under Obama's plan was suddenly secure in the U.S. for the first time in 13 years, had begun wondering if now was the time to leave.\par \par \uc2 "You are almost an American!" Javier had written to Marilu that night, after Obama's announcement, trying to be hopeful.\par \par \uc2 "Maybe it's better to be Mexican," she had responded. "Every day here is a mess without you."\par \par \uc2 Now, on this messy day, Rocio jumped on the couch and shook her mother's shoulders. "School!" she said, and finally Marilu got up. She put on slippers and grabbed her car keys. School already had started. Her children would be late for the 18th time \u8212\'20\'14 another failure in the country that Marilu believed was offering to improve her life while simultaneously ruining it.\par \par \uc2 Obama had made his decision. Now she needed to make hers. Stay or go?\par \par \uc2 "Hurry," she said, and she rushed the children into the car and drove to school.\par \par \uc2 The waiting game\par \par \uc2 Her 13 years in the United States had unfolded in a series of emergencies she had somehow managed to solve. So surely, she thought, there was a way out of this, too. "We need a reason to hope," she wrote to Javier, one night, and then she skipped work to attend a community meeting about Obama's plan, expecting to find a solution embedded in the details. She brought all four children to a church basement and sat in the back row. Edwin, 10, took brochures off an entry table and folded them into paper airplanes. Heidi, 4, ran circles around the room. Marilu took out a notebook and a pen. "Possibilities," she wrote, and then waited to hear what they might be.\par \par \uc2 The event had been organized by Marilu's friend, a local immigration activist named Veronica Dahlberg, who began by sharing what she considered welcome news: Parents of children who were born in the U.S. could stay and work. Up to 5\u160\'00\'A0million illegal residents qualified for relief. "This is progress!" she told the group, but before she could finish, people began raising their hands.\par \par \uc2 "So, does this make us citizens?" one asked.\par \par \uc2 "No, not exactly," Dahlberg said.\par \par \uc2 "Is it permanent?" another asked. "We can be here for good?"\par \par \uc2 "No," Dahlberg said. "It lasts for three years."\par \par \uc2 "Then what?" said a man in front. "We give the government our information, and then in three years they can use it to find and deport us?"\par \par \uc2 A few people clapped in agreement, a few others stood to ask more questions, and soon the church was so loud that Marilu couldn't hear Dahlberg. She thought about all the other times when it seemed like her life in the United States had reached a dead end. She had grown up in Chiapas, the poorest state in Mexico, and left for the U.S. at 15 with the first person who would take her, a man she recalled as being twice her age who began abusing her after they made it to Akron. She had been too afraid to report him to the police, so she lived for a year in a house run by nuns. She had moved a dozen times in the next decade, from one cash-only apartment to the next, worried that signing her name to a lease might lead to her deportation. She had lost her work authorization papers and found a co-worker to fudge new ones. She had lost her ride to the factory and summoned the courage to ask a co-worker to teach her how to drive without a license. This was Javier, and he had taken Marilu to drive circles around a \uc2 Wal-Mart\uc2  parking lot until one day he said she was ready to drive home.\par \par \uc2 For as long as she could remember, hers had been a hidden life: Always some new problem. Always some solution that came just in time.\par \par \uc2 She stood up from her seat and walked to the front of the meeting with Mia, the 1-year-old, in her arms. The room was still loud. Dahlberg saw Marilu and tried to introduce her to the group. Marilu turned away from the room and started asking questions of her own.\par \par \uc2 "What about people who were already deported?" she asked, still carrying the notebook, still waiting to write down the first possibility. "Can they come back?"\par \par \uc2 "I'm sorry. Not yet," Dahlberg said.\par \par \uc2 "But Javier has only been gone two months."\par \par \uc2 "I know."\par \par \uc2 "He was good. He was perfect. He would have qualified."\par \par \uc2 "I know," Dahlberg said again.\par \par \uc2 The room had quieted, and people were watching them now. A man handed Marilu a tissue. She looked at the floor and tried not to cry.\par \par \uc2 "Please," she told Dahlberg. "Tell me something good."\par \par \uc2 Dahlberg had been helping immigrants for 30\u160\'00\'A0years, and she still felt unsure of how to deal with the issue of hope. What constituted optimism and what was a lie? Was it best to give Marilu some small amount of belief \u8212\'20\'14 enough to bolster her up, to keep her functioning? Or was it better to say the truth: that Obama was promising to strengthen enforcement on the border, and Javier's return to the U.S. seemed at best unlikely and at worst impossible; that it could take months, or even years, to sort through the possibilities; that Marilu's best chance to reunite her family quickly was to collect passports for the children and buy plane tickets south.\par \par \uc2 "Maybe we can still find some way to push," Dahlberg said. "Can you hold out for another six months?"\par \par \uc2 "Six months?" Marilu said. Mia started to cry. She tried rocking her. "No. I don't think so."\par \par \uc2 "Three months?"\par \par \uc2 "No."\par \par \uc2 "How long can you manage?" Dahlberg asked.\par \par \uc2 "Maybe a month," Marilu said. "A week. I'm losing my mind. I don't know."\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18There\u8217\'20\'19s nothing for you\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 A few days later, she received another voice mail from the principal at St. Mary's Catholic School.\par \par \uc2 "Mrs. Morales, I'm very sorry, but things can't go on like this," the principal said. "We are worried about your children. Edwin is being disruptive again. We need you to talk to him."\par \par \uc2 Marilu replayed the message as she made the 15-minute drive across town to the school. She had trouble with English, having relied for too long on Javier as her translator, but she understood enough to know this call was bad. She phoned Javier from the car, reaching him on the scratchy landline in the open-aired house he shared with a dozen relatives. He had just gotten back from nine hours in the lime fields, clearing the ground with a machete, saving another $3 from his pay so that maybe, one day, he could give $8,000 to a smuggler, hike five days across the desert, bus to Ohio and reunite with his children.\par \par \uc2 "Is everything okay?" he asked Marilu. Lately, he was always worried; he reminded her each morning to sign the children up for free school meals and to give Edwin his medication.\par \par \uc2 "They don't listen anymore," Marilu told him now. "Not to me, not to their teachers."\par \par \uc2 Marilu had long considered St. Mary's the best reason to stay in Akron. For $100 each year in subsidized tuition, the school had turned Rocio and Edwin into prayerful Catholics and capable students. Rocio was two years ahead in math. Edwin's artwork was displayed in the halls. Their classmates had introduced them to \uc2 Disney\uc2 , the \uc2 NFL\uc2 , hand-clapping games and Thanksgiving. It was St. Mary's, Marilu believed, that had turned her children into true Americans \u8212\'20\'14 assertive and self-assured, better at speaking English than Spanish. In the aftermath of Javier's deportation, teachers had offered her children free breakfast, coats, aftercare and counseling. The clergy had prayed for Javier's return. "A miracle school," Marilu called it. But now the school's relationship with her consisted mainly of these phone messages, at least a dozen saved on her cellphone, the narrative of a family trauma.\par \par \uc2 "Mrs. Morales, I can't stress this enough, it really is important to arrive at school on time," the principal had said, one week after Javier was deported.\par \par \uc2 "Edwin has been refusing to sit down in his class," he had said, a few weeks later.\par \par \uc2 "We know this is a difficult time, but these are serious issues of classroom obedience," he had said, a few days after that.\par \par \uc2 "I'm sorry, but Edwin is down to his last chance," he had said, in his next message.\par \par \uc2 "We are relying on you to get through to him," he was saying now, in this latest message. "You need to come up with a plan."\par \par \uc2 Marilu pulled up to the school, where Edwin and Rocio were waiting out front. "I'm not happy," she told them, and they drove home in silence. Edwin ran into the house and went to his bedroom to grab a video game. "No way," Marilu said, taking it from him. Rocio turned on the TV, and Marilu turned it off. She gathered all four of her children on the couch and stared at them. "I don't know what to say," she said. She was furious with them and heartbroken for them and exhausted by them. "You are making me crazy," she said.\par \par \uc2 They had each rebelled in their own ways since Javier's deportation, but the one Marilu worried about most was Rocio, 8, because until recently there had been no reason to worry about her at all. "One of our best," her teacher had written, in an evaluation weeks before Javier's deportation. St. Mary's awarded its top students with a currency called Dino Bucks, and at the beginning of the school year Rocio had earned the most in the second grade \u8212\'20\'14 42, a testament to high achievement, a mark of status within the school. But students who arrived late were docked two Dino Bucks, and now Rocio was often late, so she began her days by reluctantly handing over some of what she'd earned. "You are ruining everything!" Rocio had screamed at her mother, once, and then one day at school she had seen a few actual dollars sitting on a classmate's desk and decided to take them. "Stealing," the teacher had written in a note home to Marilu, and so Rocio had been suspended for the first time in her life. Marilu had punished her by forcing her to stare at a wall in their apartment, but instead Rocio had kicked her foot right through it, creating a gaping hole. Now the friends who had been kind enough to let them stay in the apartment were suggesting it might be time to move out.\par \par \uc2 "I am tired of apologizing for all of you," Marilu said, sitting across the couch from her children. She told them she was taking away TV and \uc2 Nintendo\uc2 . She was locking up the snacks. "You need to do better or you won't have a school or a house," she said. "We'll have no place to go."\par \par \uc2 "Good," Rocio said, glaring back at her. "Let's leave. I hate it here. I want to go to Mexico."\par \par \uc2 "Me too," Heidi said.\par \par \uc2 "You don't know anything about Mexico," Marilu said, thinking about the future that awaited them in Javier's village, where public school ended in ninth grade and the few jobs available paid $10 a day. The boys would pick limes. The girls would grind corn and make tortillas over a wood stove. "There's nothing for you," she said.\par \par \uc2 "I want to live with Dad," Rocio said.\par \par \uc2 "Me too," Heidi said again.\par \par \uc2 "He told me he has to bathe in a river," Edwin said. "I'm never doing that. I'm waiting for him to come back."\par \par \uc2 "He can't right now," Marilu said. "He wants to. He loves you. But he can't."\par \par \uc2 Rocio looked at her mother and started to cry. "But you said he was coming back in a little while," she said. "When is he coming?"\par \par \uc2 "I don't know," Marilu said.\par \par \uc2 "You lied," Rocio said.\par \par \uc2 Marilu reached out to hug her. "I want him, too," she said, and she crammed next to her children on the couch. She had to leave for work in an hour, and the children would be alone until her friends came over to watch them. She turned on the TV. She got out the snacks. She handed Edwin his \uc2 Nintendo\uc2 . "I'm sorry," she said.\par \par \uc2 Getting by\par \par \uc2 She got up from the couch to cook dinner. She drove to the factory and worked a 10-hour shift. She came home, fed the baby, did the dinner dishes and then slept in her work clothes for two hours on the couch. At 7 a.m., a phone call woke her up. It was Javier, calling like he did three times every day.\par \par \uc2 "Did you remember?" he asked.\par \par \uc2 "Of course," she lied, sitting up on the couch, trying to think of what she was forgetting.\par \par \uc2 "My birthday," he said.\par \par \uc2 "Thirty-one" she said.\par \par \uc2 "Thirty-two," he said. "Are you taking the day off work?"\par \par \uc2 "Yes," she lied again.\par \par \uc2 It had been one of their traditions in seven years together: Whenever someone in the family had a birthday, both Javier and Marilu requested the day off. They both had worked 12-hour shifts at the window factory, six days each week on opposite schedules to avoid paying for child care. They had never had time or money to take vacations together, so birthdays had become their mini-vacations. Marilu liked to take the children to restaurants and movies. Javier always chose the zoo.\par \par \uc2 Now it had been a month since Marilu had so much as taken the children outside to a playground. Heidi was going stir-crazy and sometimes drawing on the walls. Rocio kept asking to go for a walk. They had lived in the new apartment for two months, but already Marilu resented every corner of it: the clothes spilling all over the bedroom since it lacked a closet; the stove that would never turn on and the kitchen faucet that would never turn off. "Can we please go somewhere?" Heidi kept asking, and Marilu wanted to, but it was winter, and she was working, and she was tired, and their new neighborhood consisted mostly of boarded-up houses and unlit streets.\par \par \uc2 "I can't take them anywhere by myself, not all four," she told Javier now. "We sit. We wait. We don't do anything."\par \par \uc2 "That's not true," Javier said.\par \par \uc2 "It's different now," she told him.\par \par \uc2 "Then what can we do?" he asked.\par \par \uc2 Marilu wasn't ready to tell him about the list she had been making, comparing Mexico to the United States. America was better for the children, she had decided \u8212\'20\'14 safer, nicer, richer, better schools. But she couldn't manage it without a co-parent, someone with whom to split bills and child care. A few times, she had dressed up for community meetings where she knew there would be men, layering her eyes with makeup, streaking her dark hair with blonde highlights. Two co-workers had asked her to dinner and a man from church had invited her over, but each time she had declined. As much as she needed someone, she had decided, she needed Javier more. He was the first man she had loved \u8212\'20\'14 not just a caretaker but also a father and a husband.\par \par \uc2 "We're stuck," she told him.\par \par \uc2 "I know," he said.\par \par \uc2 The decision\par \par \uc2 "America!" the Univision anchor was shouting early one day. "Finally, we can act like real people! We don't have to hide! We can live!" and something about the way he said it cut through the white noise of another disastrous morning and lifted Marilu off the couch. She made herself coffee. She showered. She got Edwin and Rocio to school on time. She took the baby to a park. She came home and called Javier: "I feel good," she told him, because it was true. On this day at least, she knew what she wanted to do.\par \par \uc2 She met with Dahlberg, her friend and the immigration activist, and for once she drove through downtown Akron without fixating on the speed limit. She passed the police station and didn't feel nervous. She saw a building adorned with American flags and official government seals and, instead of avoiding it, steered into the parking lot. She walked up the stairs into Akron's central post office and approached the main counter. Dahlberg came to translate.\par \par \uc2 "I'm hoping to get passports for my children," Marilu said, when she reached the front of the line.\par \par \uc2 "When are you traveling?" the employee asked.\par \par \uc2 "Soon," Marilu said. She explained that none of her four children had travel documents. She hoped to get them right away.\par \par \uc2 "Okay," the employee said. "If they are under 16, both parents will need to be present."\par \par \uc2 "That's not possible," Marilu said.\par \par \uc2 "Then we will need a copy of both parents' driver's licenses."\par \par \uc2 "We don't have those," Marilu said.\par \par \uc2 "Then we will need certified consent from the other parent," the employee said, and Marilu stepped away from the counter and let Dahlberg take over. Dahlberg spoke to the employee, collected a stack of forms and translated for Marilu on their way back out to the car.\par \par \uc2 "This won't be easy," Dahlberg said, beginning to explain what it would take for this illegal resident of the United States to leave. First, Marilu would need to send Javier a stack of forms in Mexico, even though his village had no mail delivery. He would need to sign those forms, and to somehow get them notarized, and to somehow send them back to the United States. Marilu would need to secure her own travel documents, which meant tracking down her birth certificate in Chiapas and bringing it to the Mexican consulate in Detroit. Then she would need to pay for the children's passport photos ($20 each) and for the processing of their paperwork ($105 each) and for their plane tickets ($1,200 each). And then, if all went well, they would be on their way to Javier's village, where there was no house for them, no beds, no running water, no English-speaking teachers and no jobs.\par \par \uc2 "Okay," Marilu said. "I can do this."\par \par \uc2 Her mind would change again and again during the next days, but for now she drove home from the post office feeling certain enough to begin the paperwork. There were forms for each child, and she studied the questions and considered the answers.\par \par \uc2 Place of birth: "USA," she said.\par \par \uc2 Citizenship: "USA."\par \par \uc2 Country of residence: "USA."\par \par \uc2 "Please explain in detail the reason for your request," one question asked, and her mind flooded with so many possible answers: bad timing, money, politics, family, Rocio, Edwin, Heidi, Mia.\par \par \uc2 In the America where President Obama had suddenly given her options, one seemed like the best.\par \par \uc2 "We need to leave," she said.\par \par \uc2 eli.saslow@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020141221eacl000p3\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved   \par \par \uc2 Their TV was showing another rally celebrating President Obama's long-awaited announcement about immigration reform, but to Marilu Morales it just sounded like more white noise. "Gracias a Presidente Obama!" shouted an anchor on Univision, as Marilu, 29, returned home near dawn after another midnight shift and collapsed onto the couch. Lately, she needed the sound of a TV to help her sleep. She needed Tylenol, blackout curtains and anything else that could numb what her life had become in the 10 weeks since her husband, Javier Flores, was deported.\par \par \uc2 Her four children were already awake and getting ready for school - the 4-year-old dressing the 1-year-old in shorts and mismatched sneakers; the 10-year-old helping the 8-year-old with the last of her math homework. They watched cartoons and ate leftover pizza. They packed their backpacks and let their mother rest until exactly 7:30 a.m., just like Marilu had asked them to do. Then they climbed onto the couch and began trying to rouse her.\par \par \uc2 "We have to go," said Rocio, 8. "Come on. Get up. You said we couldn't be late again."\par \par \uc2 "Okay," Marilu said, her eyes still half closed. "I just got back from work. I need a few more minutes."\par \par \uc2 They had been late to school 17 times in the past few months, an unraveling that began when Javier was pulled over with expired tags on his way home from work, detained and sent back to Mexico with only the clothes he was wearing. Soon after that, Marilu had started arriving late to her job at a window factory because she was caring for the children alone, leading to her demotion to a longer, overnight shift. Next, exhausted after work, she began sleeping through the drop-off time at her children's school. Then, without Javier's salary, she had failed to pay rent on their suburban house, so they had moved into a friend's cramped apartment, where all five of them slept in one room.\par \par \uc2 "Mom, seriously, wake up!" Rocio said again, louder this time. School started in 10 minutes. The drive took 15. "Please," Rocio said, but Marilu waved her away.\par \par \uc2 The apartment was decorated with balloons and streamers left over from two weeks before, when Marilu had hosted a few friends to watch Obama announce the specifics of his executive action on immigration. "Finally!" she had written to Javier earlier that day, as he also prepared to watch from his new home after 13 years in Ohio, an open-air hut surrounded by the lime groves of southern Mexico. They listened as Obama said it was cruel to separate children from their parents. They heard him say America was in the business of keeping families together.\par \par \uc2 "It's time to draw the line," Obama had said, explaining which illegal immigrants could apply for legal status and which ones could not - and then he drew a line that ran right through their family and nearly a million others like it, ones already separated by recent deportations.\par \par \uc2 Under Obama's executive action, Javier, who would have qualified for relief if only it had come 10 weeks earlier, would instead be stuck in Mexico. Their children, all American citizens, could only live with both parents by joining him in a town of 900 near the Guatemalan border. And Marilu, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who under Obama's plan was suddenly secure in the U.S. for the first time in 13 years, had begun wondering if now was the time to leave.\par \par \uc2 "You are almost an American!" Javier had written to Marilu that night, after Obama's announcement, trying to be hopeful.\par \par \uc2 "Maybe it's better to be Mexican," she had responded. "Every day here is a mess without you."\par \par \uc2 Now, on this messy day, Rocio jumped on the couch and shook her mother's shoulders. "School!" she said, and finally Marilu got up. She put on slippers and grabbed her car keys. School already had started. Her children would be late for the 18th time - another failure in the country that Marilu believed was offering to improve her life while simultaneously ruining it.\par \par \uc2 Obama had made his decision. Now she needed to make hers. Stay or go?\par \par \uc2 "Hurry," she said, and she rushed the children into the car and drove to school.\par \par \uc2 Her 13 years in the United States had unfolded in a series of emergencies she had somehow managed to solve. So surely, she thought, there was a way out of this, too. "We need a reason to hope," she wrote to Javier, one night, and then she skipped work to attend a community meeting about Obama's plan, expecting to find a solution embedded in the details. She brought all four children to a church basement and sat in the back row. Edwin, 10, took brochures off an entry table and folded them into paper airplanes. Heidi, 4, ran circles around the room. Marilu took out a notebook and a pen. "Possibilities," she wrote, and then waited to hear what they might be.\par \par \uc2 The event had been organized by Marilu's friend, a local immigration activist named Veronica Dahlberg, who began by sharing what she considered welcome news: Parents of children who were born in the U.S. could stay and work. Up to 5 million illegal residents qualified for relief. "This is progress!" she told the group, but before she could finish, people began raising their hands.\par \par \uc2 "So, does this make us citizens?" one asked.\par \par \uc2 "No, not exactly," Dahlberg said.\par \par \uc2 "Is it permanent?" another asked. "We can be here for good?"\par \par \uc2 "No," Dahlberg said. "It lasts for three years."\par \par \uc2 "Then what?" said a man in front. "We give the government our information, and then in three years they can use it to find and deport us?"\par \par \uc2 A few people clapped in agreement, a few others stood to ask more questions, and soon the church was so loud that Marilu couldn't hear Dahlberg. She thought about all the other times when it seemed like her life in the United States had reached a dead end. She had grown up in Chiapas, the poorest state in Mexico, and left for the U.S. at 15 with the first person who would take her, a man she recalled as being twice her age who began abusing her after they made it to Akron. She had been too afraid to report him to the police, so she lived for a year in a house run by nuns. She had moved a dozen times in the next decade, from one cash-only apartment to the next, worried that signing her name to a lease might lead to her deportation. She had lost her work authorization papers and found a co-worker to fudge new ones. She had lost her ride to the factory and summoned the courage to ask a co-worker to teach her how to drive without a license. This was Javier, and he had taken Marilu to drive circles around a \uc2 Wal-Mart\uc2  parking lot until one day he said she was ready to drive home.\par \par \uc2 For as long as she could remember, hers had been a hidden life: Always some new problem. Always some solution that came just in time.\par \par \uc2 She stood up from her seat and walked to the front of the meeting with Mia, the 1-year-old, in her arms. The room was still loud. Dahlberg saw Marilu and tried to introduce her to the group. Marilu turned away from the room and started asking questions of her own.\par \par \uc2 "What about people who were already deported?" she asked, still carrying the notebook, still waiting to write down the first possibility. "Can they come back?"\par \par \uc2 "I'm sorry. Not yet," Dahlberg said.\par \par \uc2 "But Javier has only been gone two months."\par \par \uc2 "I know."\par \par \uc2 "He was good. He was perfect. He would have qualified."\par \par \uc2 "I know," Dahlberg said again.\par \par \uc2 The room had quieted, and people were watching them now. A man handed Marilu a tissue. She looked at the floor and tried not to cry.\par \par \uc2 "Please," she told Dahlberg. "Tell me something good."\par \par \uc2 Dahlberg had been helping immigrants for 30 years, and she still felt unsure of how to deal with the issue of hope. What constituted optimism and what was a lie? Was it best to give Marilu some small amount of belief - enough to bolster her up, to keep her functioning? Or was it better to say the truth: that Obama was promising to strengthen enforcement on the border, and Javier's return to the U.S. seemed at best unlikely and at worst impossible; that it could take months, or even years, to sort through the possibilities; that Marilu's best chance to reunite her family quickly was to collect passports for the children and buy plane tickets south.\par \par \uc2 "Maybe we can still find some way to push," Dahlberg said. "Can you hold out for another six months?"\par \par \uc2 "Six months?" Marilu said. Mia started to cry. She tried rocking her. "No. I don't think so."\par \par \uc2 "Three months?"\par \par \uc2 "No."\par \par \uc2 "How long can you manage?" Dahlberg asked.\par \par \uc2 "Maybe a month," Marilu said. "A week. I'm losing my mind. I don't know."\par \par \uc2 A few days later, she received another voice mail from the principal at St. Mary's Catholic School.\par \par \uc2 "Mrs. Morales, I'm very sorry, but things can't go on like this," the principal said. "We are worried about your children. Edwin is being disruptive again. We need you to talk to him."\par \par \uc2 Marilu replayed the message as she made the 15-minute drive across town to the school. She had trouble with English, having relied for too long on Javier as her translator, but she understood enough to know this call was bad. She phoned Javier from the car, reaching him on the scratchy landline in the open-air house he shared with a dozen relatives. He had just gotten back from nine hours in the lime fields, clearing the ground with a machete, saving another $3 from his pay so that maybe, one day, he could give $8,000 to a smuggler, hike five days across the desert, bus to Ohio and reunite with his children.\par \par \uc2 "Is everything okay?" he asked Marilu. Lately, he was always worried; he reminded her each morning to sign the children up for free school meals and to give Edwin his medication.\par \par \uc2 "They don't listen anymore," Marilu told him now. "Not to me, not to their teachers."\par \par \uc2 Marilu had long considered St. Mary's the best reason to stay in Akron. For $100 each year in subsidized tuition, the school had turned Rocio and Edwin into prayerful Catholics and capable students. Rocio was two years ahead in math. Edwin's artwork was displayed in the halls. Their classmates had introduced them to \uc2 Disney\uc2 , the \uc2 NFL\uc2 , hand-clapping games and Thanksgiving. It was St. Mary's, Marilu believed, that had turned her children into true Americans - assertive and self-assured, better at speaking English than Spanish. In the aftermath of Javier's deportation, teachers had offered her children free breakfast, coats, aftercare and counseling. The clergy had prayed for Javier's return. "A miracle school," Marilu called it. But now the school's relationship with her consisted mainly of these phone messages, at least a dozen saved on her cellphone, the narrative of a family trauma.\par \par \uc2 "Mrs. Morales, I can't stress this enough, it really is important to arrive at school on time," the principal had said, one week after Javier was deported.\par \par \uc2 "Edwin has been refusing to sit down in his class," he had said, a few weeks later.\par \par \uc2 "We know this is a difficult time, but these are serious issues of classroom obedience," he had said, a few days after that.\par \par \uc2 "I'm sorry, but Edwin is down to his last chance," he had said, in his next message.\par \par \uc2 "We are relying on you to get through to him," he was saying now, in this latest message. "You need to come up with a plan."\par \par \uc2 Marilu pulled up to the school, where Edwin and Rocio were waiting out front. "I'm not happy," she told them, and they drove home in silence. Edwin ran into the house and went to his bedroom to grab a video game. "No way," Marilu said, taking it from him. Rocio turned on the TV, and Marilu turned it off. She gathered all four of her children on the couch and stared at them. "I don't know what to say," she said. She was furious with them and heartbroken for them and exhausted by them. "You are making me crazy," she said.\par \par \uc2 They had each rebelled in their own ways since Javier's deportation, but the one Marilu worried about most was Rocio, 8, because until recently there had been no reason to worry about her at all. "One of our best," her teacher had written, in an evaluation weeks before Javier's deportation. St. Mary's awarded its top students with a currency called Dino Bucks, and at the beginning of the school year Rocio had earned the most in the second grade - 42, a testament to high achievement, a mark of status within the school. But students who arrived late were docked two Dino Bucks, and now Rocio was often late, so she began her days by reluctantly handing over some of what she'd earned. "You are ruining everything!" Rocio had screamed at her mother, once, and then one day at school she had seen a few actual dollars sitting on a classmate's desk and decided to take them. "Stealing," the teacher had written in a note home to Marilu, and so Rocio had been suspended for the first time in her life. Marilu had punished her by forcing her to stare at a wall in their apartment, but instead Rocio had kicked her foot right through it, creating a gaping hole. Now the friends who had been kind enough to let them stay in the apartment were suggesting it might be time to move out.\par \par \uc2 "I am tired of apologizing for all of you," Marilu said, sitting across the couch from her children. She told them she was taking away TV and \uc2 Nintendo\uc2 . She was locking up the snacks. "You need to do better or you won't have a school or a house," she said. "We'll have no place to go."\par \par \uc2 "Good," Rocio said, glaring back at her. "Let's leave. I hate it here. I want to go to Mexico."\par \par \uc2 "Me too," Heidi said.\par \par \uc2 "You don't know anything about Mexico," Marilu said, thinking about the future that awaited them in Javier's village, where public school ended in ninth grade and the few jobs available paid $10 a day. The boys would pick limes. The girls would grind corn and make tortillas over a wood stove. "There's nothing for you," she said.\par \par \uc2 "I want to live with Dad," Rocio said.\par \par \uc2 "Me too," Heidi said again.\par \par \uc2 "He told me he has to bathe in a river," Edwin said. "I'm never doing that. I'm waiting for him to come back."\par \par \uc2 "He can't right now," Marilu said. "He wants to. He loves you. But he can't."\par \par \uc2 Rocio looked at her mother and started to cry. "But you said he was coming back in a little while," she said. "When is he coming?"\par \par \uc2 "I don't know," Marilu said.\par \par \uc2 "You lied," Rocio said.\par \par \uc2 Marilu reached out to hug her. "I want him, too," she said, and she crammed next to her children on the couch. She had to leave for work in an hour, and the children would be alone until her friends came over to watch them. She turned on the TV. She got out the snacks. She handed Edwin his \uc2 Nintendo\uc2 . "I'm sorry," she said.\par \par \uc2 She got up from the couch to cook dinner. She drove to the factory and worked a 10-hour shift. She came home, fed the baby, did the dinner dishes and then slept in her work clothes for two hours on the couch. At 7 a.m., a phone call woke her up. It was Javier, calling like he did three times every day.\par \par \uc2 "Did you remember?" he asked.\par \par \uc2 "Of course," she lied, sitting up on the couch, trying to think of what she was forgetting.\par \par \uc2 "My birthday," he said.\par \par \uc2 "Thirty-one," she said.\par \par \uc2 "Thirty-two," he said. "Are you taking the day off work?"\par \par \uc2 "Yes," she lied again.\par \par \uc2 It had been one of their traditions in seven years together: Whenever someone in the family had a birthday, both Javier and Marilu requested the day off. They both had worked 12-hour shifts at the window factory, six days each week on opposite schedules to avoid paying for child care. They had never had time or money to take vacations together, so birthdays had become their mini-vacations. Marilu liked to take the children to restaurants and movies. Javier always chose the zoo.\par \par \uc2 Now it had been a month since Marilu had so much as taken the children outside to a playground. Heidi was going stir-crazy and sometimes drawing on the walls. Rocio kept asking to go for a walk. They had lived in the new apartment for two months, but already Marilu resented every corner of it: the clothes spilling all over the bedroom since it lacked a closet; the stove that would never turn on and the kitchen faucet that would never turn off. "Can we please go somewhere?" Heidi kept asking, and Marilu wanted to, but it was winter, and she was working, and she was tired, and their new neighborhood consisted mostly of boarded-up houses and unlit streets.\par \par \uc2 "I can't take them anywhere by myself, not all four," she told Javier now. "We sit. We wait. We don't do anything."\par \par \uc2 "That's not true," Javier said.\par \par \uc2 "It's different now," she told him.\par \par \uc2 "Then what can we do?" he asked.\par \par \uc2 Marilu wasn't ready to tell him about the list she had been making, comparing Mexico to the United States. America was better for the children, she had decided - safer, nicer, richer, better schools. But she couldn't manage it without a co-parent, someone with whom to split bills and child care. A few times, she had dressed up for community meetings where she knew there would be men, layering her eyes with makeup, streaking her dark hair with blond highlights. Two co-workers had asked her to dinner and a man from church had invited her over, but each time she had declined. As much as she needed someone, she had decided, she needed Javier more. He was the first man she had loved - not just a caretaker but also a father and a husband.\par \par \uc2 "We're stuck," she told him.\par \par \uc2 "I know," he said.\par \par \uc2 "America!" the Univision anchor was shouting early one day. "Finally, we can act like real people! We don't have to hide! We can live!" and something about the way he said it cut through the white noise of another disastrous morning and lifted Marilu off the couch. She made herself coffee. She showered. She got Edwin and Rocio to school on time. She took the baby to a park. She came home and called Javier: "I feel good," she told him, because it was true. On this day at least, she knew what she wanted to do.\par \par \uc2 She met with Dahlberg, her friend and the immigration activist, and for once she drove through downtown Akron without fixating on the speed limit. She passed the police station and didn't feel nervous. She saw a building adorned with American flags and official government seals and, instead of avoiding it, steered into the parking lot. She walked up the stairs into Akron's central post office and approached the main counter. Dahlberg came to translate.\par \par \uc2 "I'm hoping to get passports for my children," Marilu said, when she reached the front of the line.\par \par \uc2 "When are you traveling?" the employee asked.\par \par \uc2 "Soon," Marilu said. She explained that none of her four children had travel documents. She hoped to get them right away.\par \par \uc2 "Okay," the employee said. "If they are under 16, both parents will need to be present."\par \par \uc2 "That's not possible," Marilu said.\par \par \uc2 "Then we will need a copy of both parents' driver's licenses."\par \par \uc2 "We don't have those," Marilu said.\par \par \uc2 "Then we will need certified consent from the other parent," the employee said, and Marilu stepped away from the counter and let Dahlberg take over. Dahlberg spoke to the employee, collected a stack of forms and translated for Marilu on their way back out to the car.\par \par \uc2 "This won't be easy," Dahlberg said, beginning to explain what it would take for this illegal resident of the United States to leave. First, Marilu would need to send Javier a stack of forms in Mexico, even though his village had no mail delivery. He would need to sign those forms, and to somehow get them notarized, and to somehow send them back to the United States. Marilu would need to secure her own travel documents, which meant tracking down her birth certificate in Chiapas and bringing it to the Mexican Consulate in Detroit. Then she would need to pay for the children's passport photos ($20 each) and for the processing of their paperwork ($105 each) and for their plane tickets ($1,200 each). And then, if all went well, they would be on their way to Javier's village, where there was no house for them, no beds, no running water, no English-speaking teachers and no jobs.\par \par \uc2 "Okay," Marilu said. "I can do this."\par \par \uc2 Her mind would change again and again during the next days, but for now she drove home from the post office feeling certain enough to begin the paperwork. There were forms for each child, and she studied the questions and considered the answers.\par \par \uc2 Place of birth: "USA," she said.\par \par \uc2 Citizenship: "USA."\par \par \uc2 Country of residence: "USA."\par \par \uc2 "Please explain in detail the reason for your request," one question asked, and her mind flooded with so many possible answers: bad timing, money, politics, family, Rocio, Edwin, Heidi, Mia.\par \par \uc2 In the America where President Obama had suddenly given her options, one seemed like the best.\par \par \uc2 "We need to leave," she said.\par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com\par \par \uc2 WP20141221marilu1221\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020141221eacl00057\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 right-turn\par {\*\bkmkstart toc14}{\*\bkmkend toc14}\b \uc2 The immigration decision is a mess \b0\par\par\uc2 By Jennifer Rubin   \par \uc2 728 \uc2 words\par \uc2 17 December 2014\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2014, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Well, the judge had a little bit of it right, but ultimately his exercise in jurisprudential gymnastics in order to declare President \uc2 Obama\uc2 's executive order unconstitutional is plainly faulty. If challengers are going to invalidate the action they will need another vehicle.\par \par \uc2 Jonathan Adler writes:\par \par \uc2 Earlier Tuesday, a federal court in Pennsylvania declared aspects of President \uc2 Obama\uc2 's\u160\'00\'A0executive actions on immigration policy unconstitutional.\par \par \uc2 No quibble from many conservatives with that. But how did this get decided? This was a criminal proceeding against an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  (arrested for drunk driving and facing deportation) claiming protection under the executive order. The court raised the issue and told the parties to brief it. Although he acknowledged the executive order governed only civil proceedings, he nevertheless opined on the president's order. That was mistake No. 1. "He acknowledges this point but says that the outcome of the criminal case will affect a future civil deportation proceeding, which would be covered by the order, " says John Yoo, who, like me, believes the action is illegitimate. "But that is speculative, because we don't know about the proceeding in the future yet." To make matters worse, the judge decided on the constitutionality of the action before deciding if it applied to the defendant, which it did not (because he did not fit within the criteria of any designated group of people protected under the president's order). Most law students know that when the constitutional issue can be avoided, the court is obliged to decide the case on more limited grounds. Here the judge went looking for it and went right for the issue he wanted to address.\u160\'00\'A0In other words, the whole discussion is "dicta," extraneous material and does not stand for much of anything. And it is really bad judging.\par \par \uc2 The judge may be right on the ultimate constitutional question, but he blew it by, in essence, creating an improper pretext to get to that issue. (Yoo says, "There is no real dispute over the law, because regardless of whether the executive order is constitutional or not, it would make no difference in Juarez-Escobar's case \u8212\'20\'14in fact, the defendant here pled guilty.") The case does not really affect anything and won't be effective precedent in other cases.\par \par \uc2 The judge had it right when he said that the president's power does not include "unilateral implementation of legislative policies" (p. 19). And he is certainly correct that this goes well beyond prosecutorial discretion because it sets forth a "systematic and rigid process" more akin to legislation and because it affords substantive rights (green card) (p. 20.) But being right on the merits is not enough for a court. Just as the president is circumscribed in his power, courts are not allowed to reach out, use a case before them\u160\'00\'A0as an excuse to opine on an issue not properly before them\u160\'00\'A0(called an "advisory" opinion) and then take a constitutional issue first, only to decide the order does not apply to the defendant anyway. We cannot right an executive wrong with a judicial error.\par \par \uc2 There are cases in which the constitutionality of the order will be properly before the court. States have filed suit and by precedent are permitted to plead an injury due to non-enforcement of the law. In addition, an employer should be able to ask a court to tell him if he can or cannot hire someone who is legal to work simply by virtue of the president's actions. (If he guesses wrong he is subject to fines.) Conservatives do care about constitutional process and limitations. They should, therefore, call out this judge for overreach, thank him for the road map to a proper constitutional argument on the merits and then find a case that properly presents the issue. In short, the district court case is nothing to celebrate. As Yoo put it, "Conservatives should remain principled in their opposition to President \uc2 Obama\uc2 's misuse of executive power, but they should also remain true in their resistance to the siren song of judicial activism. They should not invite judges to carry out the heavy work of opposing the President which here is the duty of \uc2 Congress\uc2 ."

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 At rallies outside the White House promoting relief for illegal immigrants this year, banners and chants demanded, "No more divided families." Undocumented protesters declared that if President \uc2 Obama\uc2  granted them protection, their first priority would be to go home to visit parents or children they had not seen in years.\par \par \uc2 But many are now discovering that the president's Nov.\u160\'00\'A020 action, while stopping deportations that take \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  parents away from their children, does not allow families divided between the United States and their homelands to be reunited, except for brief emergency trips.\par \par \uc2 One of the most compelling arguments for broad immigration reform was family reunification. But the failure of \uc2 Congress\uc2  to pass reform legislation has led instead to piecemeal policies \u8212\'20\'14 such as \uc2 Obama\uc2 's 2012 action protecting young "dreamers" from deportation and his new one sheltering mainly parents of U.S.-born children \u8212\'20\'14 that ease legal burdens but fail to address that fundamental yearning.\par \par \uc2 Now, hundreds of thousands of undocumented families who left children or parents behind are in a special bind. They may still be tempted to arrange illegal cross-border visits, but they have more to lose now if they get caught, because it would jeopardize their new legal status and their ability to support the children they have here.\par \par \uc2 "This will not reunite families," said \uc2 Andrea Rodriguez\uc2 , a lawyer at the Central American Resource Center in the District, which has begun offering workshops explaining \uc2 Obama\uc2 's latest action and preparing immigrants to apply. It is widely expected that even those who qualify will only be able to travel home with special one-time permission, usually granted for emergencies.\par \par \uc2 "People may no longer have to miss a parent's funeral or hospitalization," Rodriguez said. "But for those who have been separated for years from their parents or children, and simply want to reconnect with them, it is not going to be possible. There will still be that worry and stress."\par \par \uc2 This realization has begun to dampen the mood of jubilant relief that flooded immigrant communities last month after \uc2 Obama\uc2 's announcement, which will allow several million people with U.S.-born children to work and live here legally for the first time. Most of them have parents back home, and many left older children behind as well.\par \par \uc2 Rosa Pelaez, 32, an immigrant from Mexico who lives in the District, said she is thrilled that she and her husband, Juan Flores, who have four U.S.-born children, will probably qualify for three-year protection. After almost 15 years in the United States, both expect to be able to live and work legally for the first time, without fear of being caught and deported.\par \par \uc2 But \uc2 Obama\uc2 's action will not grant Pelaez her dearest wish: to see her father again. Until this month, she was under the mistaken impression that the executive action would allow her to travel to Mexico, where she left home as a teenager and where her dad, now an ailing widower, lives alone in the same house.\par \par \uc2 "I know my father is lonely. All these years working here, I've helped him pay to put light and water in his house, but I have never been able to see him," said Pelaez, 32. She held out a blurry snapshot of a gray-haired man, standing next to a cinder-block shack surrounded by banana plants. "Now they say I still can't go visit him unless it's for his funeral."\par \par \uc2 Family reunification\par \par \uc2 Two years ago, when \uc2 Obama\uc2  announced a similar executive action granting temporary deportation relief to about 700,000 \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  youths, known as dreamers, the issue of family reunification was not as dire. Some dreamers grew up in the United States without their parents, but many came to the United States as children with older family members.\par \par \uc2 This time, though, many of the families who qualify for the president's protection are the same kinds of families whose children, left behind in El Salvador or Honduras, surged across the U.S.-Mexico border this year after their parents \u8212\'20\'14 anxious to save them from gang violence or just longing to be with them \u8212\'20\'14 paid smugglers to bring them north.\par \par \uc2 So far, no one is predicting that \uc2 Obama\uc2 's latest action will prompt a new wave of border arrivals, and immigrant advocates note that parents who qualify for his plan will have much more at stake if they attempt to travel illegally, including work permits, some health benefits and a possible path to permanent residency.\par \par \uc2 The government has not yet published the final rules for \uc2 Obama\uc2 's plan, but immigration experts expect they will be almost identical to those issued with the 2012 executive action that established the "Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals" program, or DACA.\par \par \uc2 Like other forms of temporary protection for illegal immigrants, DACA did not confer the right to travel. Under U.S. law, even those granted relief from deportation are still considered illegal, and they can only leave the country legally by applying for a one-time emergency travel document called "advance parole." Immigration officials have full discretion whether to approve or deny such requests, and often they are denied.\par \par \uc2 Several immigrant parents who left their children back home, dismayed to learn that \uc2 Obama\uc2 's latest action would not allow them to travel, said they would still consider having their children smuggled north. Isabel Cruz, 38, a Salvadoran restaurant worker in Maryland, said she worries constantly about her two sons back home, especially since the older one was recently beaten by gang members.\par \par \uc2 "If the new law won't let us find a way to be together, maybe I will have to take the risk and start sending for them," said Cruz, who has a younger child born in the United States. "It is not safe for them in my country."\par \par \uc2 Others with children here to care for said they would rather remain separated from loved ones than risk the hazards of illegal travel. Maria Mu\u241\'00\'F1oz, 26, a dishwasher in the District, said she misses her parents in El Salvador but has built her plans firmly around her daughter, Andrea, 2, who was born in the United States. She expects to apply for deferred deportation in the spring.\par \par \uc2 "My greatest dream is to go home and see my family, but even if I get the chance, I would come right back," said Mu\u241\'00\'F1oz, who has been in the United States for eight years. As she spoke, she tried to hold her squirming daughter while eating a plate of tacos in a Mexican cafe. "I want her to be a prepared person, to go to an American university," Mu\u241\'00\'F1oz said. "In this life, you have to choose between the past and the future."\par \par \uc2 Humanitarian needs\par \par \uc2 According to instructions issued by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services for DACA recipients, travel requests may be granted for any of three purposes: humanitarian needs, such as medical treatment or a family funeral; educational opportunities, such as exchange programs; and employment requirements, such as attending conferences.\par \par \uc2 Applicants who meet the travel criteria must pay a fee of $360 and wait, often for weeks, while immigration officials decide whether to approve the trip. "Travel for vacation," the instructions add dryly, "is not a valid basis for advance parole."\par \par \uc2 Patrick Taurel, a lawyer with the \uc2 American Immigration Council\uc2  in the District, said his nonprofit agency has been urging immigration officials to broaden the definition of "humanitarian" travel to include family reunions. "To visit a close family member you haven't seen in years, isn't that a humanitarian purpose?" Taurel asked. "This is a very important and dear issue to a lot of people."\par \par \uc2 Rodriguez, who conducted a workshop this week on how to apply for deportation relief, said that immigration officials have been granting more permissions lately for trips they deemed "important," and that at least one DACA student was approved for a college exchange trip back to El Salvador. "It doesn't hurt to try," she said.\par \par \uc2 Citizenship and Immigration Services officials provided the current rules for advance parole but declined to comment on any plans to change those guidelines.\par \par \uc2 For Pelaez, the yearning to go home and take care of her ailing father in Mexico has been increasingly overshadowed by her responsibilities as the mother of three children in elementary school and a newborn, all U.S. citizens. Her husband, Flores, 40, a grounds\u173\'00\'ADkeeper, has not seen his mother in 20 years, but he is focused on a different goal through \uc2 Obama\uc2 's action: obtaining a work permit and finally asking for a raise.\par \par \uc2 In the couple's tiny apartment in the District one night this week, a jumble of children and pets cavorted on several mattresses crammed into one room, while Pelaez kept a semblance of order. With 8-week-old Sebastian napping on her chest, she rummaged through an album of old family photos from Mexico, full of hammocks and chickens and barefoot kids.\par \par \uc2 "We were so poor back then. Life is much better here," she said. Across the room, her two older sons huddled excitedly over an iPad, playing a race-car game and chattering away in English. Her daughter came in, wearing a smart plaid school uniform, and picked up the family cat. As Pelaez looked around the room, it was clear that she had already made her choice.\par \par \uc2 pamela.constable@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020141210eaca002xm\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved   \par \par \uc2 At rallies outside the White House promoting relief for illegal immigrants this year, banners and chants demanded, "No more divided families." Undocumented protesters declared that if President \uc2 Obama\uc2  granted them protection, their first priority would be to go home to visit parents or children they had not seen in years.\par \par \uc2 But many are now discovering that the president's Nov. 20 action, while stopping deportations that take \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  parents away from their children, does not allow families divided between the United States and their homelands to be reunited except for brief emergency trips.\par \par \uc2 One of the most compelling arguments for broad immigration reform was family reunification. But the failure of \uc2 Congress\uc2  to pass reform legislation has led instead to piecemeal policies - such as \uc2 Obama\uc2 's 2012 action protecting young "dreamers" from deportation and his new one sheltering mainly parents of U.S.-born children - that ease legal burdens but fail to address that fundamental yearning.\par \par \uc2 Now, hundreds of thousands of undocumented families who left children or parents behind are in a special bind. They may still be tempted to arrange illegal cross-border visits, but they have more to lose now if they get caught, because it would jeopardize their new legal status and their ability to support the children they have here.\par \par \uc2 "This will not reunite families," said \uc2 Andrea Rodriguez\uc2 , a lawyer at the Central American Resource Center in the District, which has begun offering workshops explaining \uc2 Obama\uc2 's latest action and preparing immigrants to apply. It is widely expected that even those who qualify will be able to travel home only with special one-time permission, usually granted for emergencies.\par \par \uc2 "People may no longer have to miss a parent's funeral or hospitalization," Rodriguez said. "But for those who have been separated for years from their parents or children and simply want to reconnect with them, it is not going to be possible. There will still be that worry and stress."\par \par \uc2 This realization has begun to dampen the mood of jubilant relief that flooded immigrant communities last month after \uc2 Obama\uc2 's announcement, which will allow several million people with U.S.-born children to work and live here legally for the first time. Most have parents back home, and many left older children behind as well.\par \par \uc2 Rosa Pelaez, 32, an immigrant from Mexico who lives in the District, said she is thrilled that she and her husband, Juan Flores, who have four U.S.-born children, will probably qualify for three-year protection. After almost 15 years in the United States, both expect to be able to live and work legally for the first time without fear of being caught and deported.\par \par \uc2 But \uc2 Obama\uc2 's action will not grant Pelaez her dearest wish: to see her father again. Until this month, she was under the mistaken impression that the executive action would allow her to travel to Mexico, which she left as a teenager and where her dad, now an ailing widower, lives alone in the same house.\par \par \uc2 "I know my father is lonely. All these years working here, I've helped him pay to put light and water in his house, but I have never been able to see him," Pelaez said. She held out a blurry snapshot of a gray-haired man standing next to a cinder-block shack surrounded by banana plants. "Now they say I still can't go visit him unless it's for his funeral."\par \par \uc2 Two years ago, when \uc2 Obama\uc2  announced a similar executive action granting temporary deportation relief to about 700,000 \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  youths, known as dreamers, the issue of family reunification was not as dire. Some dreamers grew up in the United States without their parents, but many came to the United States as children with older family members.\par \par \uc2 This time, though, many of the families who qualify for the president's protection are the same kinds of families whose children, left behind in El Salvador or Honduras, surged across the U.S.-Mexico border this year after their parents - anxious to save them from gang violence or just longing to be with them - paid smugglers to bring them north.\par \par \uc2 So far, no one is predicting that \uc2 Obama\uc2 's latest action will prompt a new wave of border arrivals, and immigrant advocates note that parents who qualify for his plan will have much more at stake if they attempt to travel illegally, including work permits, some health benefits and a possible path to permanent residency.\par \par \uc2 The government has not published the final rules for \uc2 Obama\uc2 's plan, but immigration experts expect they will be almost identical to those issued with the 2012 executive action that established the "Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals" program, or DACA.\par \par \uc2 Like other forms of temporary protection for illegal immigrants, DACA did not confer the right to travel. Under U.S. law, even those granted relief from deportation are still considered illegal, and they can leave the country legally only by applying for a one-time emergency travel document called "advance parole." Immigration officials have full discretion whether to approve or deny such requests, and often they are denied.\par \par \uc2 Several immigrant parents who left their children back home, dismayed to learn that \uc2 Obama\uc2 's latest action would not allow them to travel, said they would still consider having their children smuggled north. Isabel Cruz, 38, a Salvadoran restaurant worker in Maryland, said she worries constantly about her two sons back home, especially since the older one was recently beaten by gang members.\par \par \uc2 "If the new law won't let us find a way to be together, maybe I will have to take the risk and start sending for them," said Cruz, who has a younger child born in the United States. "It is not safe for them in my country."\par \par \uc2 Others with children here to care for said they would rather remain separated from loved ones than risk the hazards of illegal travel. Maria Mu\u241\'00\'F1oz, 26, a dishwasher in the District, said she misses her parents in El Salvador but has built her plans firmly around her daughter, Andrea, 2, who was born in the United States. She expects to apply for deferred deportation in the spring.\par \par \uc2 "My greatest dream is to go home and see my family, but even if I get the chance, I would come right back," said Mu\u241\'00\'F1oz, who has been in the United States for eight years. As she spoke, she tried to hold her squirming daughter while eating a plate of tacos in a Mexican cafe. "I want her to be a prepared person, to go to an American university," Mu\u241\'00\'F1oz said. "In this life, you have to choose between the past and the future."\par \par \uc2 According to instructions issued by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services for DACA recipients, travel requests may be granted for any of three purposes: humanitarian needs, such as medical treatment or a family funeral; educational opportunities, such as exchange programs; and employment requirements, such as attending conferences.\par \par \uc2 Applicants who meet the travel criteria must pay a fee of $360 and wait, often for weeks, while immigration officials decide whether to approve the trip. "Travel for vacation," the instructions add dryly, "is not a valid basis for advance parole."\par \par \uc2 Patrick Taurel, a lawyer with the \uc2 American Immigration Council\uc2  in the District, said his nonprofit agency has been urging immigration officials to broaden the definition of "humanitarian" travel to include family reunions. "To visit a close family member you haven't seen in years, isn't that a humanitarian purpose?" Taurel asked. "This is a very important and dear issue to a lot of people."\par \par \uc2 Rodriguez, who conducted a workshop this week on how to apply for deportation relief, said that immigration officials have been granting more permissions lately for trips they deemed "important" and that at least one DACA student was approved for a college exchange trip back to El Salvador. "It doesn't hurt to try," she said.\par \par \uc2 Citizenship and Immigration Services officials provided the current rules for advance parole but declined to comment on any plans to change those guidelines.\par \par \uc2 For Pelaez, the yearning to go home and take care of her ailing father in Mexico has been increasingly overshadowed by her responsibilities as the mother of three children in elementary school and a newborn, all U.S. citizens. Her husband, Flores, 40, a groundskeeper, has not seen his mother in Mexico in 20 years, but he is focused on a different goal through \uc2 Obama\uc2 's action: obtaining a work permit and finally asking for a raise.\par \par \uc2 In the couple's tiny apartment in the District one night this week, a jumble of children and pets cavorted on several mattresses crammed into one room while Pelaez kept a semblance of order. With 8-week-old Sebastian napping on her chest, she rummaged through an album of old family photos from Mexico, full of hammocks and chickens and barefoot kids.\par \par \uc2 "We were so poor back then. Life is much better here," she said. Across the room, her two older sons huddled excitedly over an iPad, playing a race-car game and chattering away in English. Her daughter came in, wearing a smart plaid school uniform, and picked up the family cat. As Pelaez looked around the room, it was clear that she had already made her choice.\par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com\par \par \uc2 WP20141211immigtravel1211\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020141211eacb0001x\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved   \par \par \uc2 NASHVILLE - President \uc2 Obama\uc2  came here to drum up support for his executive action on immigration and acknowledged that this city might not seem like the most obvious choice.\par \par \uc2 "Some people might think Nashville was an odd place to talk about immigration. It's not what comes to mind when people think about gateways to America," \uc2 Obama\uc2  said at Casa Azafran, a local community center, but added: "Nashville's got one of the fastest-growing immigrant populations in the country."\par \par \uc2 Nashville, the legendary capital of country music, is also home to thousands of Mexicans, Burmese and as many as 11,000 Kurds, all drawn by the modest cost of living, job opportunities and an international community.\par \par \uc2 One out of every eight Nashville residents was born abroad, and 16 percent of the city's population speaks a language other than English at home, according to the 2010 Census.\par \par \uc2 The president's event here marked his third trip outside Washington to rally public support for his executive actions, following speeches in Las Vegas and Chicago late last month. On the trip to Nashville, he was joined on Air Force One by \uc2 Frank Sharry\uc2  of America's Voice and Lorella Praeli of United We Dream, longtime immigration activists who were critical of \uc2 Obama\uc2  for not taking executive action sooner but have been supportive since his announcement last month.\par \par \uc2 The White House hopes \uc2 Obama\uc2 's personal appeal on immigration can help rebut fierce criticism by Republicans, who have attempted to paint him as imperial and acting unlawfully in circumventing \uc2 Congress\uc2  on his immigration changes.\par \par \uc2 "When members of \uc2 Congress\uc2  question whether I have the authority to do this, I have one answer: Yes, and pass a bill," \uc2 Obama\uc2  said during a question-and-answer session in a small room.\par \par \uc2 Nursing a cup of tea, \uc2 Obama\uc2  fielded questions from people worried that a future administration could roll back \uc2 Obama\uc2 's protections for undocumented immigrants, something he said could happen. But the president said Americans "basically have a good heart" and would be opposed to any changes.\par \par \uc2 "I think any future administration that tried to punish people for doing the right thing I think would not have the support of the American people," \uc2 Obama\uc2  said. He also stressed that people need to sign up for the protections and stressed that they would not be in danger.\par \par \uc2 Obama\uc2  said he believes most Americans feel that people who are already in the country deserve a shot and that it is difficult to separate families for decades. \uc2 Obama\uc2  also stressed that his actions are meant to keep families together and place deportation priority on criminals.\par \par \uc2 "Now, does that mean everybody's going to listen to me on the other side? Not necessarily. They're pretty sure I'm an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  and - that was a joke," \uc2 Obama\uc2  said.\par \par \uc2 While \uc2 Obama\uc2  was joined by some members of the Tennessee congressional delegation, others voiced their opposition to his policy.\par \par \uc2 Republican Rep. Diane Black said \uc2 Obama\uc2  chose "Nashville as a destination to publicly thumb his nose at the American electorate that just rebuked him in the last election."\par \par \uc2 Until recently, Nashville seemed an unlikely spot to highlight immigration success. Six years ago, the city was deeply divided during a referendum on whether to make English the official and only language of the city government. A broad cross-section of the city - businesses, civil liberties groups and others - united to defeat the measure.\par \par \uc2 In Tennessee, there are about 130,000 illegal immigrants, according to estimates by the \uc2 Pew Research Center\uc2 . Under the executive action, 40,000 will be eligible for deportation relief on top of the 15,000 who qualified under \uc2 Obama\uc2 's 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.\par \par \uc2 Casa Azafran, which opened two years ago, is also a showcase for government assistance. It received $1.8 million from the Commerce Department's Economic Development Administration and about $300,000 from the Department of Health and Human Services. It sits about three miles down Nolensville Pike, past taco trucks and auto body shops, from Maria Ramos's store, California Fashions. Cowboy boots sit on the same wall as traditional Mexican woven shoes, which Ramos said she sells to remind people of home.\par \par \uc2 Ramos came to the United States from Mexico in 1994 with her two children. She applied for all three of them to get citizenship that year; so far, she has been the only one able to procure it. Her children, now in their mid-30s, said they are stuck in a backlog. They both have children who were born in the United States, meaning they will be eligible to stay under \uc2 Obama\uc2 's action.\par \par \uc2 Ramos said she was excited about \uc2 Obama\uc2 's visit to Nashville, which she said has changed dramatically in the 20 years she has lived here. "There's a recognition that we are contributing members of society," she said.\par \par \uc2 Ramos wants \uc2 Obama\uc2  to do more to help small businesses such as hers, which were battered by the recession, and while she is thrilled about his executive action on immigration, she said he should have done it long ago.\par \par \uc2 Steven Mufson contributed to this report. \par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com\par \par \uc2 WP20141210immigration1210\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020141210eaca0003b\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 NASHVILLE \u8212\'20\'14 President \uc2 Obama\uc2  came here to drum up support for his executive action on immigration and acknowledged that this city might not seem like the most obvious choice.\par \par \uc2 "Some people might think Nashville was an odd place to talk about immigration. It's not what comes to mind when people think about gateways to America," \uc2 Obama\uc2  said at Casa Azafran, a local community center, but added: "Nashville's got one of the fastest-growing immigrant populations in the country."\par \par \uc2 Nashville, the legendary capital of country music, is also home to thousands of Mexicans, Burmese and as many as 11,000 Kurds, all drawn by the modest cost of living, job opportunities and an international community.\par \par \uc2 One out of every eight Nashville residents was born abroad, and 16\u160\'00\'A0percent of the city's population speaks a language other than English at home, according to the 2010 Census.\par \par \uc2 The president's event here marked his third trip outside Washington to rally public support for his executive actions, following speeches\u173\'00\'AD in Las Vegas and Chicago late last month. On the trip to Nashville, he was joined on Air Force One by \uc2 Frank Sharry\uc2  of America's Voice and Lorella Praeli of United We Dream, longtime immigration activists who were critical of \uc2 Obama\uc2  for not taking executive action sooner but have been supportive since his announcement last month.\par \par \uc2 The White House hopes \uc2 Obama\uc2 's personal appeal on immigration can help rebut fierce criticism by Republicans, who have attempted to paint him as imperial and acting unlawfully in circumventing \uc2 Congress\uc2  on his immigration changes\u173\'00\'AD.\par \par \uc2 "When members of \uc2 Congress\uc2  question whether I have the authority to do this, I have one answer: Yes, and pass a bill," \uc2 Obama\uc2  said during a question-and-answer session in a small room.\par \par \uc2 Nursing a cup of tea, \uc2 Obama\uc2  fielded questions from people worried that a future administration could roll back \uc2 Obama\uc2 's protections for undocumented immigrants, something he said could happen. But the president said Americans "basically have a good heart" and would be opposed to any changes\u173\'00\'AD.\par \par \uc2 "I think any future administration that tried to punish people for doing the right thing I think would not have the support of the American people," \uc2 Obama\uc2  said. He also stressed that people need to sign up for the protections and stressed that they would not be in danger.\par \par \uc2 Obama\uc2  said he believes most Americans feel that people who are already in the country deserve a shot and that it is difficult to separate families for decades. \uc2 Obama\uc2  also stressed that his actions are meant to keep families together and place deportation priority on criminals.\par \par \uc2 "Now, does that mean everybody's going to listen to me on the other side? Not necessarily. They're pretty sure I'm an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  and \u8212\'20\'14 that was a joke," \uc2 Obama\uc2  said.\par \par \uc2 While \uc2 Obama\uc2  was joined by some members of the Tennessee congressional delegation, others voiced their opposition to his policy.\par \par \uc2 Republican Rep. Diane Black said \uc2 Obama\uc2  chose "Nashville as a destination to publicly thumb his nose at the American electorate that just rebuked him in the last election."\par \par \uc2 Until recently, Nashville seemed an unlikely spot to highlight immigration success. Six years ago, the city was deeply divided during a referendum on whether to make English the official and only language of the city government. A broad cross-section of the city \u8212\'20\'14 businesses, civil liberties groups and others \u8212\'20\'14 united to defeat the measure.\par \par \uc2 In Tennessee, there are about 130,000 illegal immigrants, according to estimates by the \uc2 Pew Research Center\uc2 . Under the executive action, 40,000 will be eligible for deportation relief on top of the 15,000 who qualified under \uc2 Obama\uc2 's 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.\par \par \uc2 Casa Azafran, which opened two years ago, is also a showcase for government assistance. It received $1.8\u160\'00\'A0million from the Commerce Department's Economic Development Administration and about $300,000 from the Department of Health and Human Services. It sits about three miles down Nolensville Pike, past taco trucks and auto body shops, from Maria Ramos's store, California Fashion. Cowboy boots sit on the same wall as traditional Mexican woven shoes, which Ramos said she sells to remind people of home.\par \par \uc2 Ramos came to the United States from Mexico in 1994 with her two children. She applied for all three of them to get citizenship that year; so far, she has been the only one able to procure it. Her children, now in their mid-30s, said they are stuck in a backlog. They both have children who were born in the United States, meaning they will be eligible to stay under \uc2 Obama\uc2 's action.\par \par \uc2 Ramos said she was excited about \uc2 Obama\uc2 's visit to Nashville, which she said has changed dramatically in the 20 years she has lived here. "There's a recognition that we are contributing members of society," she said.\par \par \uc2 Ramos wants \uc2 Obama\uc2  to do more to help small businesses such as hers, which were battered by the recession, and while she is thrilled about his executive action on immigration, she said he should have done it long ago.\par \par \uc2 katie.zezima@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 david.nakamura@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 Steven Mufson contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020141209eac9004k7\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 After a lengthy review of racial and ethnic profiling in federal law enforcement policy, the Obama administration has decided to allow the practice to continue in immigration law enforcement:\par \par \uc2 The Obama administration will soon issue new rules curtailing the use of profiling, but federal agents will still be allowed to consider race and ethnicity when stopping people at airports, border crossings and immigration checkpoints, according to several government officials.\par \par \uc2 I. The Enormous Scope of Racial and Ethnic Profiling in Immigration Enforcement.\par \par \uc2 As the New York Times notes in the above-linked article, federal officials are permitted to use racial profiling in areas far beyond the border, as that term is understood by laypeople:\par \par \uc2 Federal agents have jurisdiction to enforce immigration laws within 100 miles of the borders, including the coastlines, an area that includes roughly a third of the United States, and nearly two-thirds of its population. Federal agents board buses and \uc2 Amtrak\uc2  trains in upstate New York, questioning passengers about their citizenship and detaining people who cannot produce immigration papers. Border Patrol agents also run inland checkpoints looking for illegal immigrants. Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, has called the existing rules "a license to profile."\par \par \uc2 The areas in question have large Hispanic and Asian-American populations, and therefore large numbers of people likely to be victimized by racial profiling of the sort that the Obama administration has decided to continue.\par \par \uc2 II. Why Conservative Advocates of Color-blind Government Should Oppose Racial Profiling in Law Enforcement.\par \par \uc2 This decision is likely to disappoint liberal opponents of racial profiling. The president could easily forbid racial profiling in federal immigration enforcement by issuing an executive order banning it. If anything is within the scope of executive discretion in law enforcement, it is the tactics used by federal law enforcement agencies. Yet he has chosen not to do so. In fairness, he is, in this case, continuing practices that predate his administration. But the fact that previous administrations did the same thing is a poor excuse for an administration that prides itself on promoting racial justice and a president who promised to bring "change we can believe in."\par \par \uc2 The perpetuation of racial profiling in immigration enforcement should also trouble conservative advocates of racial color-blindess by government. If they truly believe, as Chief Justice John Roberts puts it, that "[t]he way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race," they cannot allow a giant exception to this principle when it comes to law enforcement, whether in immigration law or elsewhere.\par \par \uc2 As I explained here and here, most of the reasons conservatives cite for opposing racial preferences in college admissions also apply to the use of racial profiling in law enforcement. In both cases, government uses race as a tool for economizing on information costs.\par \par \uc2 Conservative defenders of racial and ethnic profiling argue that it is justified because members of some racial and ethnic groups have much higher crime rates than others, and in a world of imperfect information, government should target enforcement efforts on those groups. A Hispanic-looking person in a border area is much more likely to be an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  than, say, a white Anglo-Saxon. If federal officials had perfect information about each person they encounter, they would not need to use race as a proxy. But unfortunately, they don't. But defenders of racial preferences in admissions can make exactly the same type of argument. An African-American applicant is, on average, more likely to have been the victim of racial discrimination than a white one. Similarly, members of some racial and ethnic groups are more likely to contribute to diversity than others. If we had perfect information about each applicant, admissions officers would not need to use race as a proxy. But unfortunately they don't.\par \par \uc2 Conservatives rightly reject these sorts of rationales in the college admissions context. They point out that the use of even statistically accurate racial generalizations by government still inflicts injustices on innocent individuals and exacerbates racial conflict. They also emphasize that once racial discrimination becomes institutionalized, it is difficult to limit its scope. But exactly the same points apply to the use of racial discrimination in law enforcement. It too inevitably victimizes large numbers of innocent people, exacerbates racial tensions, and tends to expand once established.\par \par \uc2 In recent years, some conservatives have begun to recognize the tension between opposition to affirmative action and support for racial profiling, and have become more critical of the latter. My George Mason colleague Nelson Lund, a prominent conservative legal scholar, was among the first conservative commentators to do so.\par \par \uc2 Some conservatives, such as Jonah Goldberg nonetheless, continue to argue that racial profiling is more defensible than affirmative action because it inflicts only minor harms on its victims, whereas racial preferences in college admissions inflict much greater damage, perhaps even a "lifetime loss" for students unable to attend their preferred college. This theory is flawed for reasons I outlined here:\par \par \uc2 Whether affirmative action causes more harm to its victims than racial profiling varies from case to case. In some situations, getting stopped by the police will be a "lifetime loss" too, especially if nervousness or overreaction by either side causes a misunderstanding that escalates into violence. In other cases, it could result in your being detained for hours even if you are never charged with any crime (especially if the officer thinks you haven't demonstrated the proper "respect" for his authority). The fear that racial profiling engenders among lower-class blacks and Hispanics (including those who never actually get profiled themselves) is also a significant cost.\par \par \uc2 I would add that the perpetuation of racial profiling also poisons relations between law enforcement and minority communities. If Hispanic immigrants believe that the government is treating them as second-class citizens \u8212\'20\'14 a perception likely to be reinforced by widespread racial profiling \u8212\'20\'14 that is likely to impede their assimilation and increase ethnic hostility. These too are significant potential harms that go beyond the often modest short term inconveniences of being stopped by law enforcement officials.\par \par \uc2 III. What if Racial Discrimination is the Only Way to Enforce Our Current System of Immigration Restrictions?\par \par \uc2 The New York Times article reports that the Obama administration ultimately decided to allow racial profiling in immigration enforcement to continue because the Department of Homeland Security claimed that immigration restrictions can't be enforced without it:\par \par \uc2 "The immigration investigators have said, 'We can't do our job without taking ethnicity into account. We are very dependent on that,' " said one official briefed on the new rules. "They want to have the least amount of restrictions holding them back."\par \par \uc2 If it really is true that current immigration restrictions can't be enforced without large-scale racial and ethnic discrimination, that is a massive strike against them. It highlights the extent to which such policies unjustly victimize not only would-be immigrants, but also legal residents and American citizens.\par \par \uc2 I recognize that there might be extreme cases where racial and ethnic discrimination by government is the only way to prevent some great evil that cannot be forestalled otherwise. If, hypothetically, racial profiling were the only way to prevent an imminent nuclear terrorist attack that will kill millions, it could well be justified in such a case. But even if we aren't willing to say that the government should never be allowed to engage in racial discrimination for any reason, there should at least be a very strong presumption against such policies. I am skeptical that the supposed need to deport more immigrants, most of whom merely seek to escape Third World poverty and oppression, even comes close to overcoming that presumption. If racial discrimination really is essential to the enforcement of current immigration law, that's not a justification for racial profiling, but a justification for liberalizing immigration law.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020141207eac70063h\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The Dec. 4 editorial "An action without precedent" criticized President Obama's decision to defer deportation of undocumented parents of U.S. citizens. The editorial focused on the president's contention that the number of parents covered by his order \u8212\'20\'14 some 36 percent of the estimated total undocumented population \u8212\'20\'14 was said to be in line with the 40 percent covered by a comparable action by then-President \uc2 George H.W. Bush\uc2  in 1990. The 40 percent figure comes from the White House's claim that Mr. Bush's action "expanded the family fairness program to cover more than 1.5 million unauthorized spouses and children. This represented about 40 percent of the undocumented population at the time."\par \par \uc2 Although the 1.5 million figure appeared in 1990 congressional testimony, the editorial noted that the testimony was likely the result of a misunderstanding and the actual figure was surely much lower, maybe as much as only 200,000, which amounts to 6 percent of the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  population at the time.\par \par \uc2 That's the wrong ratio. The more relevant ratio is between two other figures the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel ultimately focused on when it advised Mr. Obama that the temporary deferral program is legally within his authority to prioritize immigration enforcement with limited resources: "[T]here are approximately 11.3 million undocumented aliens in the country, but .\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09.Congress has appropriated sufficient resources for ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] to remove fewer than 400,000 aliens each year." Its conclusion seems unassailable: "There is thus little practical danger that the program, simply by virtue of its size, will impede removals that would otherwise occur in its absence."\par \par \uc2 Jerold D.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 As President Obama moves forward with his plan to shield millions of undocumented immigrants from deportation, an existing program to protect young illegal migrants demonstrates the life-changing promise of executive action but also its profound shortcomings, according to experts and government documents.\par \par \uc2 The 2012 initiative has given temporary protection to slightly more than 700,000 people brought to the United States illegally as children. They say that program has helped them emerge from the shadows, making possible a work permit, a Social Security number and enhanced self-respect.\par \par \uc2 But hundreds of thousands who advocacy groups say are eligible have not applied under the program, known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. Some immigrants say they are afraid they will be rejected and deported, while others are daunted by the $465 application fee and\u160\'00\'A0educational requirements. Still others remain unfamiliar with the program because of language and cultural barriers.\par \par \uc2 The DACA initiative is in many ways a template for the measures that Obama announced Nov.\u160\'00\'A020, which could give as many as 3.7\u160\'00\'A0million undocumented parents of U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents relief from deportation for up to three years. And the record of the earlier program highlights both the potential and the pitfalls of Obama's new undertaking.\par \par \uc2 Neither program has backing from \uc2 Congress\uc2 , and that limits their scope and durability. The next president could reverse either one with the stroke of a pen.\par \par \uc2 But people on all sides of the immigration debate point to DACA as a success, though a severely qualified one.\par \par \uc2 "We know it has made a tremendous beneficial impact in the lives of hundreds of thousands of people,'' said Patrick Taurel, a legal fellow at the \uc2 American Immigration Council\uc2 , a pro-immigration group. "But it's not enough. We ultimately need \uc2 Congress\uc2  to step in and create a permanent solution.''\par \par \uc2 Although the rollout of DACA has been relatively smooth for a large government program put together in weeks, there have been problems. Immigration advocates say it can take a long time to process applications, and those who want to renew their status are facing a growing bottleneck.\par \par \uc2 Those difficulties have led some immigration experts to warn that the government could be overwhelmed by the even larger wave of applications expected under Obama's latest executive action.\par \par \uc2 "DACA was a bit of a trial run, and overall it's gone pretty well,'' said \uc2 David Martin\uc2 , a \uc2 University of Virginia\uc2  law professor who was a senior legal official in the Department of Homeland Security. "But if we're talking 4\u160\'00\'A0million people with this new program, that's going to be an even bigger challenge to gear up to handle it.''\par \par \uc2 The same agency that administers DACA \u8212\'20\'14 U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, a part of the \uc2 DHS\uc2  \u8212\'20\'14 will oversee the new program, along with an expansion of DACA that could make up to 300,000 more young immigrants eligible.\par \par \uc2 A spokesman for the immigration agency said it is processing DACA applications, including renewals, in a timely fashion.\par \par \uc2 A sense of relief\par \par \uc2 Cesar Vargas embodies both the promise and the limits of DACA.\par \par \uc2 His mother and siblings crossed into the United States illegally from Mexico when he was 5. His father had recently died, making life a struggle at times. "Since then I have been a New Yorker, Brooklyn-raised," said Vargas, 31.\par \par \uc2 Even before DACA, he graduated with a law degree from the \uc2 City University of New York\uc2 , set up his own lobbying firm and became an activist for young illegal migrants. Despite that, he couldn't get a driver's license or a credit card.\par \par \uc2 Qualifying for DACA brought an enormous sense of relief. "It really provided that strength to know I no longer could be deported any day,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Many of those granted DACA status say it has been a godsend. A survey of DACA recipients found that 60\u160\'00\'A0percent had gotten a new job and 57\u160\'00\'A0percent had obtained a driver's license, according to the \uc2 Migration Policy Institute\uc2 , an advocacy group.\par \par \uc2 But like many of his fellow recipients, Vargas faces hurdles. Because he is still an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , with his deportation only temporarily deferred, he has been barred from practicing law. He is challenging that prohibition in a New York court.\par \par \uc2 Although DACA offers immigrants something closer to a normal life, there are critical things that it is not and was never intended to be. It does not grant immigrants legal status or citizenship or a pathway to either. And for many recipients, the benefits have proved bittersweet because their parents and other family members cannot apply.\par \par \uc2 "I was so excited because I really wanted to get a driver's license and a Social Security number," said Monica Camacho, 20, who came to the United States from Mexico in 2002. She obtained DACA status two years ago and is now a student at the Community College of Baltimore County in Essex, Md.\par \par \uc2 But Camacho said her parents and two older siblings remain illegal. "My dad has worked every day of his life, just for our future," she said. "If you want to call my dad a criminal for wanting to give us a better future, it's really unfair."\par \par \uc2 Spreading the word\par \par \uc2 In neighborhoods throughout New York City, activists are passing out literature on street corners, making presentations at foreign consulates, and visiting churches and community centers \u8212\'20\'14 all in an effort to find people who are eligible for DACA but haven't applied.\par \par \uc2 "We're the cavalry of sorts, bringing DACA to all the different places where everyone else doesn't have time to go,'' said Betsy Plum, director of special projects for the \uc2 New York Immigration Coalition\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "Fear is a huge barrier,'' she said, adding that immigrants have trouble distinguishing between Citizenship and Immigration Services, which administers DACA, and \uc2 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2 , which can initiate deportation. "There is a lot of mistrust of the government, and it's really confusing \u8212\'20\'14 you have one government agency trying to help you and another trying to hurt you,'' Plum said.\par \par \uc2 Hundreds of thousands who are eligible have not applied. Advocacy groups estimate that up to 1.2\u160\'00\'A0million people were eligible for DACA when the program began and up to 2.1\u160\'00\'A0million could qualify as they get older or go back to school. The Obama administration has never provided an official estimate.\par \par \uc2 Of the immigrants who have applied, 95\u160\'00\'A0percent have received temporary relief from being deported.\par \par \uc2 A federal official said some of the people rejected for DACA have criminal records, while others failed to meet additional criteria, which include coming to the United States before their 16th birthday and living continuously in the United States since 2007.\par \par \uc2 Advocates say that instances of immigrants being deported after applying for DACA are rare. Former federal officials said they reassured immigration advocates from the start that the program would not be a pipeline for law enforcement.\par \par \uc2 Still, many undocumented immigrants won't take the risk, according to \uc2 Angelica Salas\uc2 , executive director of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles.\par \par \uc2 "What you're doing is turning yourself over [to the government]. 'I'm here. I am telling you that I am undocumented. Here, let me prove it to you,'\u160\'00\'A0" she said.\par \par \uc2 A federal official involved in immigration policy said he understands the concern. "The next president can come in and wipe this all away, and then we have you registered," the official said.\par \par \uc2 DACA's education requirement also keeps some immigrants from applying. To qualify, they must have graduated from high school, have a GED or currently be in school. "If you need to enroll in an adult education program, that requires a substantial change to your daily routine,'' Plum said.\par \par \uc2 Cultural and language barriers also play a role.\par \par \uc2 Nearly three-quarters of the DACA recipients were born in Mexico, but 19 other countries are represented, including several outside Latin America, notably South Korea, India and Poland. Some nationalities were hard to reach at first, advocates say, partly because the government took several months to translate materials into languages other than Spanish.\par \par \uc2 And in some cultures, especially Asian ones, it can be considered shameful to admit that you are an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , they said.\par \par \uc2 Up to the task\par \par \uc2 In the spring of 2012, immigration groups were clamoring for action by the Obama administration, and DACA was launched with great haste. Homeland Security officials had about two months to design and implement the program.\par \par \uc2 "We didn't know the numbers of people who would apply. It could have been a hundred thousand, it could have been a million,'' former homeland security secretary \uc2 Janet Napolitano\uc2  said in a recent interview. She added that Citizenship and Immigration Services "was concerned that they wouldn't be able to handle it and that it would be an administrative failure.''\par \par \uc2 Few are saying that now.\par \par \uc2 "It is an unquestioned success,'' said John Sandweg, a former top adviser to Napolitano who helped design DACA. "There is no doubt that the work we did established that \uc2 DHS\uc2  is ready for immigration reform.''\par \par \uc2 Others say that although the program has gone relatively smoothly, problems have emerged, raising questions about the immigration system's capacity to handle a possible flood of applicants under the new program.\par \par \uc2 Taurel, of the \uc2 American Immigration Council\uc2 , said DACA applicants occasionally have to wait far longer than the six months \uc2 DHS\uc2  promises for a decision \u8212\'20\'14 and that renewal applications are being processed slowly even when they arrive early.\par \par \uc2 At the Consumer Law Legal Aid Justice Center in Falls Church, staff lawyer Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg said he is bracing for a crushing workload when the new wave of applications comes.\par \par \uc2 "I'm literally looking out the window into the Culmore neighborhood [of Fairfax County] and these apartment buildings,'' he said, "and thinking, how in the world are we going to represent just these people in this one neighborhood, let alone all of Northern Virginia?"\par \par \uc2 jerry.markon@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 sandhya.somashekhar@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 Pamela Constable contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020141130eabu005po\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved   \par \par \uc2 As President Obama moves forward with his plan to shield millions of undocumented immigrants from deportation, an existing program to protect young illegal migrants demonstrates the life-changing promise of executive action but also its profound shortcomings, according to experts and government documents.\par \par \uc2 The 2012 initiative has given temporary protection to slightly more than 700,000 people brought to the United States illegally as children. They say that program has helped them emerge from the shadows, making possible a work permit, a Social Security number and enhanced self-respect.\par \par \uc2 But hundreds of thousands who advocacy groups say are eligible have not applied under the program, known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. Some immigrants say they are afraid they will be rejected and deported, while others are daunted by the $465 application fee and educational requirements. Still others remain unfamiliar with the program because of language and cultural barriers.\par \par \uc2 The DACA initiative is in many ways a template for the measures that Obama announced Nov. 20, which could give as many as 3.7 million undocumented parents of U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents relief from deportation for up to three years. And the record of the earlier program highlights both the potential and the pitfalls of Obama's new undertaking.\par \par \uc2 Neither program has backing from \uc2 Congress\uc2 , and that limits their scope and durability. The next president could reverse either one with the stroke of a pen.\par \par \uc2 But people on all sides of the immigration debate point to DACA as a success, though a severely qualified one.\par \par \uc2 "We know it has made a tremendous beneficial impact in the lives of hundreds of thousands of people,'' said Patrick Taurel, a legal fellow at the \uc2 American Immigration Council\uc2 , a pro-immigration group. "But it's not enough. We ultimately need \uc2 Congress\uc2  to step in and create a permanent solution.''\par \par \uc2 Although the rollout of DACA has been relatively smooth for a large government program put together in weeks, there have been problems. Immigration advocates say it can take a long time to process applications, and those who want to renew their status are facing a growing bottleneck.\par \par \uc2 Those difficulties have led some immigration experts to warn that the government could be overwhelmed by the even larger wave of applications expected under Obama's latest executive action.\par \par \uc2 "DACA was a bit of a trial run, and overall it's gone pretty well,'' said \uc2 David Martin\uc2 , a \uc2 University of Virginia\uc2  law professor who was a senior legal official in the Department of Homeland Security. "But if we're talking 4 million people with this new program, that's going to be an even bigger challenge to gear up to handle it.''\par \par \uc2 The same agency that administers DACA - U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, a part of the \uc2 DHS\uc2  - will oversee the new program, along with an expansion of DACA that could make up to 300,000 more young immigrants eligible.\par \par \uc2 A spokesman for the immigration agency said it is processing DACA applications, including renewals, in a timely fashion.\par \par \uc2 Cesar Vargas embodies both the promise and the limits of DACA.\par \par \uc2 His mother and siblings crossed into the United States illegally from Mexico when he was 5. His father had recently died, making life a struggle at times. "Since then I have been a New Yorker, Brooklyn-raised," said Vargas, 31.\par \par \uc2 Even before DACA, he graduated with a law degree from the \uc2 City University of New York\uc2 , set up his own lobbying firm and became an activist for young illegal migrants. Despite that, he couldn't get a driver's license or a credit card.\par \par \uc2 Qualifying for DACA brought an enormous sense of relief. "It really provided that strength to know I no longer could be deported any day,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Many of those granted DACA status say it has been a godsend. A survey of DACA recipients found that 60 percent had gotten a new job and 57 percent had obtained a driver's license, according to the \uc2 Migration Policy Institute\uc2 , an advocacy group.\par \par \uc2 But like many of his fellow recipients, Vargas faces hurdles. Because he is still an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , with his deportation only temporarily deferred, he has been barred from practicing law. He is challenging that prohibition in a New York court.\par \par \uc2 Although DACA offers immigrants something closer to a normal life, there are critical things that it is not and was never intended to be. It does not grant immigrants legal status or citizenship or a pathway to either. And for many recipients, the benefits have proved bittersweet because their parents and other family members cannot apply.\par \par \uc2 "I was so excited because I really wanted to get a driver's license and a Social Security number," said Monica Camacho, 20, who came to the United States from Mexico in 2002. She obtained DACA status two years ago and is now a student at the Community College of Baltimore County in Essex, Md.\par \par \uc2 But Camacho said her parents and two older siblings remain illegal. "My dad has worked every day of his life, just for our future," she said. "If you want to call my dad a criminal for wanting to give us a better future, it's really unfair."\par \par \uc2 In neighborhoods throughout New York City, activists are passing out literature on street corners, making presentations at foreign consulates, and visiting churches and community centers - all in an effort to find people who are eligible for DACA but haven't applied.\par \par \uc2 "We're the cavalry of sorts, bringing DACA to all the different places where everyone else doesn't have time to go,'' said Betsy Plum, director of special projects for the \uc2 New York Immigration Coalition\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "Fear is a huge barrier,'' she said, adding that immigrants have trouble distinguishing between Citizenship and Immigration Services, which administers DACA, and \uc2 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2 , which can initiate deportation. "There is a lot of mistrust of the government, and it's really confusing - you have one government agency trying to help you and another trying to hurt you,'' Plum said.\par \par \uc2 Hundreds of thousands who are eligible have not applied. Advocacy groups estimate that up to 1.2 million people were eligible for DACA when the program began and up to 2.1 million could qualify as they get older or go back to school. The Obama administration has never provided an official estimate.\par \par \uc2 Of the immigrants who have applied, 95 percent have received temporary relief from being deported.\par \par \uc2 A federal official said some of the people rejected for DACA have criminal records, while others failed to meet additional criteria, which include coming to the United States before their 16th birthday and living continuously in the United States since 2007.\par \par \uc2 Advocates say that instances of immigrants being deported after applying for DACA are rare. Former federal officials said they reassured immigration advocates from the start that the program would not be a pipeline for law enforcement.\par \par \uc2 Still, many undocumented immigrants won't take the risk, according to \uc2 Angelica Salas\uc2 , executive director of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles.\par \par \uc2 "What you're doing is turning yourself over [to the government]. 'I'm here. I am telling you that I am undocumented. Here, let me prove it to you,' " she said.\par \par \uc2 A federal official involved in immigration policy said he understands the concern. "The next president can come in and wipe this all away, and then we have you registered," the official said.\par \par \uc2 DACA's education requirement also keeps some immigrants from applying. To qualify, they must have graduated from high school, have a GED or currently be in school. "If you need to enroll in an adult education program, that requires a substantial change to your daily routine,'' Plum said.\par \par \uc2 Cultural and language barriers also play a role.\par \par \uc2 Nearly three-quarters of the DACA recipients were born in Mexico, but 19 other countries are represented, including several outside Latin America, notably South Korea, India and Poland. Some nationalities were hard to reach at first, advocates say, partly because the government took several months to translate materials into languages other than Spanish.\par \par \uc2 And in some cultures, especially Asian ones, it can be considered shameful to admit that you are an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , they said.\par \par \uc2 In the spring of 2012, immigration groups were clamoring for action by the Obama administration, and DACA was launched with great haste. Homeland Security officials had about two months to design and implement the program.\par \par \uc2 "We didn't know the numbers of people who would apply. It could have been a hundred thousand, it could have been a million,'' former homeland security secretary \uc2 Janet Napolitano\uc2  said in a recent interview. She added that Citizenship and Immigration Services "was concerned that they wouldn't be able to handle it and that it would be an administrative failure.''\par \par \uc2 Few are saying that now.\par \par \uc2 "It is an unquestioned success,'' said John Sandweg, a former top adviser to Napolitano who helped design DACA. "There is no doubt that the work we did established that \uc2 DHS\uc2  is ready for immigration reform.''\par \par \uc2 Others say that although the program has gone relatively smoothly, problems have emerged, raising questions about the immigration system's capacity to handle a possible flood of applicants under the new program.\par \par \uc2 Taurel, of the \uc2 American Immigration Council\uc2 , said DACA applicants occasionally have to wait far longer than the six months \uc2 DHS\uc2  promises for a decision - and that renewal applications are being processed slowly even when they arrive early.\par \par \uc2 At the Consumer Law Legal Aid Justice Center in Falls Church, staff lawyer Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg said he is bracing for a crushing workload when the new wave of applications comes.\par \par \uc2 "I'm literally looking out the window into the Culmore neighborhood [of Fairfax County] and these apartment buildings,'' he said, "and thinking, how in the world are we going to represent just these people in this one neighborhood, let alone all of Northern Virginia?"\par \par \uc2 Pamela Constable contributed to this report. \par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com\par \par \uc2 WP20141201daca1201\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020141201eac10002s\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.  \par \par \uc2 President \uc2 George H.W. Bush\uc2  "expanded the family fairness program to cover more than 1.5 million unauthorized spouses and children. This represented about 40 percent of the undocumented population at the time."\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 White House press secretary Josh Earnest, news briefing, Nov. 19, 2014\par \par \uc2 "If you look, every president \u8212\'20\'14 Democrat and Republican \u8212\'20\'14 over decades has done the same thing. \uc2 George H.W. Bush\uc2  \u8212\'20\'14 about 40 percent of the undocumented persons, at the time, were provided a similar kind of relief as a consequence of executive action."\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 President Obama, interview on \uc2 ABC News\uc2 ' "This Week," Nov. 23, 2014\par \par \uc2 This column\u160\'00\'A0has been updated with a new Pinocchio rating\par \par \uc2 Who knew that an article that appeared on Page 3 of the metro section of the \uc2 New York Times\uc2  nearly a quarter-century ago could have such resonance in today's policy debates?\par \par \uc2 As part of its justification for President Obama's executive action on immigration, the White House and its allies have repeatedly stressed that Obama's action, in impact, is roughly equivalent to a step that \uc2 George H.W. Bush\uc2  took in 1990. The United States had about 3.5 million illegal immigrants in 1990, so 1.5 million would be about 40 percent of that number. Given that about 40 percent of the current number of undocumented immigrants would be covered by Obama's actions, that 1.5 million figure is crucially important to the White House's defense of the president's decision.\par \par \uc2 Much of the news media, including The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2 , has repeated the 1.5 million figure as a fact in recent weeks. But it turns out that the number\u160\'00\'A0hangs on a slim reed.\par \par \uc2 The FactsBush's action in 1990 was designed to ease family disruptions caused by the landmark 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act, which allowed nearly 3 million illegal immigrants to gain legal permanent residency.\par \par \uc2 Under typical immigrant patterns, families do\u160\'00\'A0not all arrive together. Thus some family members qualified for residence but others still faced deportation. President Ronald Reagan at first eased the rules for minor children, and then Bush in early 1990 extended it to cover children and spouses, including authorization to work. However, the new rule did not make them legal residents, and they were required to renew their "voluntary departure" status annually; they also had no legal basis to return to the United States if they left the country.\par \par \uc2 Here's how The Post reported the Feb. 2 announcement on the front page at the time:\par \par \uc2 The Immigration and Naturalization Service yesterday reversed a stance that had drawn strong protests from Hispanic and human-rights groups by announcing a new policy to prevent the deportation of as many as 100,000 illegal aliens who are the children and spouses of newly legalized immigrants. Note that the figure given at the time of the announcement was 100,000. This number was broadly cited, in just about every article that appeared on the day after the announcement. "The new policy is likely to benefit more than 100,000 people, INS officials and immigration lawyers said," the San Francisco Chronicle reported.\par \par \uc2 The Times\uc2  ran a short Associated Press dispatch that said, "Thousands of illegal aliens who are the spouses or children of legal immigrants will be allowed to stay in this country under a new Government policy."\par \par \uc2 However, the \uc2 Philadelphia Inquirer\uc2  said the number was possibly higher: Officials "said they could not predict how many dependents would come forward, although they did not dispute estimates from immigrants' advocacy groups of 500,000 or more. 'There's no way to count them. It may run to a million,' said INS spokesman Duke Austin."\par \par \uc2 That's certainly not billed as a precise estimate. But big round numbers are often catnip for journalists.\par \par \uc2 That 1 million figure soon turned up in a \uc2 Los Angeles Times\uc2  article on Feb. 15: "Although there are no firm figures, the immigration service estimates as many as 1 million aliens could be affected by the new policy."\par \par \uc2 On March 5, \uc2 the Times\uc2  ran another article on the policy shift that included this sentence: "The Federal Immigration Commissioner, Gene McNary, said recently that as many as 1.5 million illegal aliens could be affected by the new policy, called 'family fairness,' and intended to allow close family members of legalized immigrants to remain in the country under certain conditions."\par \par \uc2 The Times\uc2  article suggested that McNary had made a public statement to this effect, but if so, it does not turn up in news databases.\par \par \uc2 Administration officials noted that a 2012 \uc2 Congressional Research Service\uc2  report said, "At the time, McNary stated that an estimated 1.5 million unauthorized aliens would benefit from the policy." CRS is nonpartisan\u160\'00\'A0and respected. But the CRS report provides no source for this comment.\par \par \uc2 McNary initially told The Fact Checker that he is fairly certain he never used that figure. "I was surprised it was 1.5 million when I read that" in the recent news reports, he said. "I would take issue with that. I don't think that's factual."\par \par \uc2 We then obtained the full testimony of a congressional hearing at which McNary testified, on Feb. 21, about three weeks after the initial announcement of 100,000. In one section, shown below, McNary appears to confirm the 1.5 million figure.\par \par \uc2 But the exchange is confusing because it also appears to refer to an earlier exchange at the hearing concerning a different category of 1.5 million people. Moreover, McNary goes on to say the potential\u160\'00\'A0universe of affected people could be as much as 3 million, which is certainly surprising, given that was the estimate of all undocumented immigrants in 1990. The entire transcript is embedded at the end of this column.\par \par \uc2 McNary testimony, Feb. 21, 1990 by GlennKesslerWP\par \par \uc2 McNary said that, 25 years later, he was puzzled by the exchange. "I can't remember saying 1.5 million. I don't even remember testifying on the subject," he said. "The 1.5 million does not fit with the other facts," he said, including the INS estimate of 100,000 at the time of the announcement. He suspects the exchange was based on a misunderstanding with his questioner, then-Rep. Bruce Morrison (D-Conn.): "Morrison was trying to get a figure out of me, and I guess I gave him one."\par \par \uc2 The figure did not appear in McNary's prepared text that day. It appears to be a random one-off comment, apparently never repeated by McNary or any other Bush administration official.\par \par \uc2 With the exception of The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  a few weeks later, no other news organization appears to have reported on the exchange.\par \par \uc2 Administration officials\u160\'00\'A0also pointed to a 1989 \uc2 Los Angeles Times\uc2  article about a \uc2 Senate\uc2  vote predating Bush's action, which quoted an unnamed aide to a senator as saying that such a move would affect 1.5 million immigrants; other news articles on the vote said "hundreds of thousands." None of the estimates appeared especially well-grounded.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, despite these high numbers, the potential applicant pool appeared much smaller. FactCheck.Org, which exhaustively reviewed previous presidential actions, found\u160\'00\'A0an article that appeared on Feb. 26, 1990, in the Interpreter Releases, a weekly newsletter on immigration news, that explained how fuzzy the data was on the number of people who might take advantage of\u160\'00\'A0the new policy. (Note that the article appeared after McNary's congressional appearance.)\par \par \uc2 First, although\u160\'00\'A042 percent (1.3 million) of the 3.1 million legalization applicants were married, 704,000 applications were still pending or on appeal, so those family members were unable to apply, the newsletter said. So that reduced the number of potential married applicants to 1 million. The INS also had no reliable data on how many applicants had children, how many spouses had been legalized, how many marriages took place after Nov. 6, 1986 (date of enactment of the Reagan law), how many were divorced, and how many were ineligible for other reasons, the newsletter said.\par \par \uc2 "The INS's own current 'guessimate' is that no more than 250,000 aliens will apply for the family fairness program," the newsletter\u160\'00\'A0said.\par \par \uc2 In fact, that estimate was even too high. On Oct. 1, 1990, the Miami Herald reported that the program was largely a bust: "In the eight months since\u160\'00\'A0McNary\u160\'00\'A0announced the family fairness\u160\'00\'A0program, INS received more than 250,000 inquiries about the program \u8212\'20\'14 but only 46,821 applications have been received nationwide."\par \par \uc2 In any case, a month later Bush signed the Immigration Act of 1990, which superseded the family fairness program. The new law changed the eligibility date from 1986 to 1988 and raised the eligibility age for children to 21, thus protecting even more people than under Bush's initial action.\par \par \uc2 Nevertheless, the numbers still remained relatively small: 52,272 in 1992, 55,344 in 1993, 34,400 (projected) in 1994, according to a 1994 report on the 1990 law.\par \par \uc2 In other words, even with the broader criteria, the number of immigrants who took advantage of Bush's action and the subsequent law was far less than 1.5 million. That's significant because INS officials had said during\u160\'00\'A0the initial news conference that they had no idea how many people would actually come forward.\par \par \uc2 White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest, citing the transcript, the \uc2 Congressional Research Service\uc2  and The \uc2 New York Times\uc2 , said the White House will continue using the 1.5 million figure.\par \par \uc2 The Pinocchio TestThe 1.5 million figure is too fishy to be cited by either the White House or the media. As best we can tell, this is a rounded-up estimate of the number of illegal immigrants who were married (1.3 million became 1.5 million.)\par \par \uc2 McNary actually\u160\'00\'A0believes the congressional exchange that spawned the number was based on a misunderstanding. In any case, it certainly was not a widely reported estimate in 1990. The number was buried\u160\'00\'A0in a single news article \u8212\'20\'14 and just because it was in the \uc2 New York Times\uc2  does not mean it was true. Eventually, however,\u160\'00\'A0it also got picked up by CRS, even though it does not appear to have been an official estimate.\par \par \uc2 Let's recall that even \uc2 the Times\uc2 ' article indicated this was a high-end estimate \u8212\'20\'14 "as many as 1.5 million." Other news reports were careful to say INS officials had no firm numbers. It's now hardened in White House statements as "more than 1.5 million."\par \par \uc2 Indeed, the 100,000 estimate that the INS gave on the day of the announcement might have been optimistic. Fewer than 50,000 applications had been received before the policy was superseded by a new law. The numbers generated by that law \u8212\'20\'14 a little more than 140,000 \u8212\'20\'14 further indicate that the universe of potential applicants was much smaller than 1.5 million, especially given that the law eased restrictions even more.\par \par \uc2 To be fair, however, the "take-up rate" could be affected by other factors, such as a reluctance to pay fees or provide documentation to federal authorities. But in the end,\u160\'00\'A0200,000 amounts to about 6 percent of the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  population at the time, not 40 percent.\par \par \uc2 We initially gave this claim a rating of Four Pinocchios. But the discovery\u160\'00\'A0of congressional testimony with the 1.5 million figure, no matter how confusing or disputed, does explain how the number could end up in a news report and ultimately in a CRS report\u8212\'20\'14even though it is contradicted by all other INS statements at the time. So we are reducing this rating to Three Pinocchios.\par \par \uc2 Three Pinocchios(About our rating scale)\par \par \uc2 Send us facts to check by filling out this form\par \par \uc2 Follow The Fact Checker on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and friend us on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and friend us on\par \par \uc2 Congressional Testimony, Feb. 21, 1990 (Key pages are 52 and 59)\par \par \uc2 Feb. 21, 1990 hearing, House subcommittee on Immigration by GlennKesslerWP\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020141124eabo00336\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 fact-checker\par {\*\bkmkstart toc24}{\*\bkmkend toc24}\b \uc2 Did \uc2 George H.W. Bush\uc2  really shield 1.5 million illegal immigrants? Nope.\b0\par\par\uc2 By Glenn Kessler  \par \uc2 1,590 \uc2 words\par \uc2 24 November 2014\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2014, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved.  \par \par \uc2 President \uc2 George H.W. Bush\uc2  "expanded the family fairness program to cover more than 1.5 million unauthorized spouses and children. This represented about 40 percent of the undocumented population at the time."\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14White House press secretary Josh Earnest, news briefing, Nov. 19, 2014\par \par \uc2 Who knew that an article that appeared on Page 3 of the metro section of the \uc2 New York Times\uc2  nearly a quarter-century ago could have such resonance in today's policy debates?\par \par \uc2 As part of its justification for President Obama's executive action on immigration, the White House and its allies have repeatedly stressed that Obama's action, in impact, is roughly equivalent to a step that \uc2 George H.W. Bush\uc2  took in 1990. The United States had about 3.5 million illegal immigrants in 1990, so 1.5 million would be about 40 percent of that number. Given that about 40 percent of the current number of undocumented immigrants would be covered by Obama's actions, that 1.5 million figure is crucially important to the White House's defense of the president's decision.\par \par \uc2 Much of the news media, including The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2 , has repeated the 1.5 million figure as a fact in recent weeks. But it turns out that the number\u160\'00\'A0hangs on a rather slim reed.\par \par \uc2 The facts\par \par \uc2 Bush's action in 1990 was designed to ease family disruptions caused by the landmark 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act, which allowed nearly 3 million illegal immigrants to gain legal permanent residency.\par \par \uc2 Under typical immigrant patterns, families do\u160\'00\'A0not all arrive together. Thus some family members qualified for residence but others still faced deportation. President Ronald Reagan at first eased the rules for minor children, and then Bush in early 1990 extended it to cover children and spouses, including authorization to work.\u160\'00\'A0 However, the new rule did not make them legal residents and they were required to renew their "voluntary departure" status annually; they also had no legal basis to return to the United States if they left the country.\par \par \uc2 Here's how The Post reported the Feb. 2 announcement on the front page at the time:\par \par \uc2 The Immigration and Naturalization Service yesterday reversed a stance that had drawn strong protests from Hispanic and human-rights groups by announcing a new policy to prevent the deportation of as many as 100,000 illegal aliens who are the children and spouses of newly legalized immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Note that the figure given at the time of the announcement was 100,000. This number was broadly cited, in just about every article that appeared on the day after the announcement. "The new policy is likely to benefit more than 100,000 people, INS officials and immigration lawyers said," the San Francisco Chronicle reported.\par \par \uc2 The Times\uc2  ran a short Associated Press dispatch that said, "Thousands of illegal aliens who are the spouses or children of legal immigrants will be allowed to stay in this country under a new Government policy."\par \par \uc2 However, the \uc2 Philadelphia Inquirer\uc2  said the number was possibly higher: "McNary and his top aides at the Immigration and Naturalization Service said they could not predict how many dependents would come forward, although they did not dispute estimates from immigrants' advocacy groups of 500,000 or more. 'There's no way to count them. It may run to a million,' said INS spokesman Duke Austin."\par \par \uc2 That's certainly not billed as a precise estimate. But big round numbers are often catnip for journalists.\par \par \uc2 That 1 million figure soon turned up in a \uc2 Los Angeles Times\uc2  article on Feb. 15: "Although there are no firm figures, the immigration service estimates as many as 1 million aliens could be affected by the new policy."\par \par \uc2 On March 5, \uc2 the Times\uc2  ran another article on the policy shift that included this sentence: "The Federal Immigration Commissioner, Gene McNary, said recently that as many as 1.5 million illegal aliens could be affected by the new policy, called 'family fairness,' and intended to allow close family members of legalized immigrants to remain in the country under certain conditions."\par \par \uc2 The Times\uc2  article suggested that McNary had made a public statement to this effect, but if so, it does not turn up in news databases.\par \par \uc2 Administration officials noted that a 2012 \uc2 Congressional Research Service\uc2  report said, "At the time, McNary stated that an estimated 1.5 million unauthorized aliens would benefit from the policy." CRS is nonpartisan\u160\'00\'A0and respected. But the CRS report provides no source for this comment, so\u160\'00\'A0it could simply be the same Times article.\par \par \uc2 McNary told The Fact Checker that he is fairly certain he never used that figure. "I was surprised it was 1.5 million when I read that" in the recent news reports, he said. "I would take issue with that. I don't think that's factual."\par \par \uc2 (Administration officials\u160\'00\'A0also pointed to a 1989 \uc2 Los Angeles Times\uc2  article about a \uc2 Senate\uc2  vote predating Bush's action, which quoted an unnamed aide to a senator as saying that such a move would affect 1.5 million immigrants; other news articles on the vote said "hundreds of thousands." None of the estimates appeared especially well-grounded.)\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, there is strong evidence that the 1.5 million estimate is grossly inflated. FactCheck.Org, which exhaustively reviewed previous presidential actions, found\u160\'00\'A0an article that appeared on Feb. 26, 1990, in the Interpreter Releases, a weekly newsletter on immigration news, that explained how fuzzy the data was on the number of people who might be affected by the new policy.\par \par \uc2 First, although\u160\'00\'A042 percent (1.3 million) of the 3.1 million legalization applicants were married, 704,000 applications were still pending or on appeal, so those family members were unable to apply, the newsletter said. So that reduced the number of potential married applicants to 1 million. The INS also had no reliable data on how many applicants had children, how many spouses had been legalized, how many marriages took place after Nov. 6, 1986 (date of enactment of the Reagan law), how many were divorced, and how many are ineligible for other reasons.\par \par \uc2 "The INS's own current 'guessimate' is that no more than 250,000 aliens will apply for the family fairness program," the newsletter\u160\'00\'A0said.\par \par \uc2 In fact, that estimate was even too high. On Oct. 1, 1990, the Miami Herald reported that the program was largely a bust: "In the eight months since\u160\'00\'A0McNary\u160\'00\'A0announced the family fairness\u160\'00\'A0program, INS received more than 250,000 inquiries about the program \u8212\'20\'14 but only 46,821 applications have been received nationwide."\par \par \uc2 In any case, a month later Bush signed the Immigration Act of 1990, which superseded the family fairness program. The new law changed the eligibility date from 1986 to 1988 and raised the eligibility age for children to 21, thus protecting even more people than under Bush's initial action.\par \par \uc2 Nevertheless, the numbers still remained relatively small: 52,272 in 1992, 55,344 in 1993, 34,400 (projected) in 1994, according to a 1994 report on the 1990 law by the federal Select Commission on Immigration and Refugee Policy.\par \par \uc2 In other words, even with the broader criteria, the number of immigrants who took advantage of Bush's action and the subsequent law was far less than 1.5 million. That's significant because INS officials had said during\u160\'00\'A0the initial news conference that they had no idea how many people would actually come forward.\par \par \uc2 The Pinocchio Test\par \par \uc2 The 1.5 million figure is too fishy to be cited by either the White House or the media. As best we can tell, this is a rounded-up estimate of the number of illegal immigrants who were married (1.3 million became 1.5 million.) But that figure was already overstated because it included applications that were pending or on appeal.\par \par \uc2 McNary believes he was misquoted. In any case, it certainly was not a widely reported estimate in 1990. The number was buried\u160\'00\'A0in a single news article \u8212\'20\'14 and just because it was in the \uc2 New York Times\uc2  does not mean it was true.\par \par \uc2 Let's recall that even this article indicated this was a high-end estimate\u8212\'20\'14"as many as 1.5 million." Other news reports were careful to say INS officials had no firm numbers. It's now hardened in White House statements as "more than 1.5 million."\par \par \uc2 Indeed, the 100,000 estimate that the INS gave on the day of the announcement might have been optimistic. Fewer than 50,000 applications had been received before the policy was superseded by a new law. The numbers generated by that law \u8212\'20\'14 a little more than 140,000 \u8212\'20\'14 further indicate that the universe of potential applicants was much smaller than 1.5 million, especially given that the law eased restrictions even more.\par \par \uc2 In the end,\u160\'00\'A0200,000 amounts to about 6 percent of the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  population at the time, not 40 percent. Small wonder the White House prefers the larger number.\par \par \uc2 To recap, the White House seized on an apparently inaccurate news report, which cited an estimate much higher than any other news organization. Meanwhile, officials ignored other contemporaneous reporting using\u160\'00\'A0much lower figures \u8212\'20\'14 as well as the actual outcome of the policy. That's worthy of Four Pinocchios.\par \par \uc2 Four Pinocchios\par \par \uc2 (About our rating scale)\par \par \uc2 Send us facts to check by filling out this form\par \par \uc2 Follow The Fact Checker on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and friend us on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and friend us on \par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020141124eabo002jp\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Style\par {\*\bkmkstart toc25}{\*\bkmkend toc25}\b \uc2 From journalism to activism: Jose Antonio Vargas\u8217\'20\'19s life on the run; The former \uc2 Washington Post\uc2  reporter turned his prodigious energies to a very personal cause: immigration.\b0\par\par\uc2 By Marc Fisher   \par \uc2 4,441 \uc2 words\par \uc2 24 November 2014\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2014, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Jose Antonio Vargas is running. He's fresh off the red-eye from California to Dulles \u8212\'20\'14 his third overnight flight in as many weeks \u8212\'20\'14 to deliver yet another speech. He grabs his backpack and goes, delivering nearly 300 talks in 44 states over the past three years. He has moved, in just five years, from Washington to New York to San Francisco. He's in a hurry to convince his fellow Americans that people like him should be considered fellow Americans.\par \par \uc2 Vargas, 33, has always been running, since he found out at 16 that he was in the United States illegally, and before that too, as a child whose mother put her 12-year-old on a plane from the Philippines to California, telling him that if anyone asked where he was going, he should say "Disneyland." He hasn't seen her since.\par \par \uc2 He runs because it got him to where he is. When he was a 27-year-old reporter at The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2 , his editors assigned him to cover the 2008 presidential campaign because they thought he could see what young voters were thinking. \uc2 ABC\uc2 's \uc2 Diane Sawyer\uc2  called him "one of the most successful young men in this country." \uc2 Arianna Huffington\uc2  hired him to help her Huffington Post staff connect with digital natives.\par \par \uc2 He runs because he never knows when the immigration authorities or the Border Patrol or any cop in the land might grab him, as they did this summer in Texas, tossing him in a cell for eight hours. Vargas has never had a valid visa or green card; he used to travel with an illegally obtained driver's license and, after 2011, a Philippines passport. Now, he has been ordered to pass through \uc2 Transportation Security Administration\uc2  checkpoints using the oddest of travel documents, a "Warrant for Arrest of Alien" on U.S. Border Patrol letterhead. It says Vargas is "within the country in violation of the immigration laws and is liable to being taken into custody." He keeps it in his backpack. He calls the document "my first American papers."\par \par \uc2 Vargas runs because he has much to prove, even after a meteoric rise as a reporter; even after he achieved his golden ambition, a piece in the New Yorker; even after a sudden flip from journalism to activism and instant celebrity in that field \u8212\'20\'14 the cover of Time, live coverage on \uc2 CNN\uc2  of his arrest in July. And yes, even after Thursday night, when President Obama announced his move to at least temporarily lift the threat of deportation from millions of illegal immigrants, including Vargas.\par \par \uc2 "So now I get a real work permit for the first time in my life?" he says a few hours after the president's address to the nation. "I get a driver's license? I get to see my mom? Is that how it works? It feels real to me, even if it's temporary."\par \par \uc2 He runs even now, because there are millions of undocumented immigrants whose status remains unchanged by Obama's executive action. He runs because he misses his mother and has no idea when he will be able to see her. And because if he slows down, his secrets might catch up to him. And because to stop would be to face the depths of his loneliness.\par \par \uc2 Joseiswriting. That's his \uc2 Twitter\uc2  handle. He tweets, e-mails, writes essays, scripts, speeches and stories. It's 6:17 a.m. and Vargas is flying from Chicago \u8212\'20\'14 where he'd been for 36 hours, giving two talks about immigration \u8212\'20\'14 to San Francisco, where he'll be for 18 hours before another red-eye to Washington, where he'll spend eight hours, then jump on \uc2 Amtrak\uc2  to New York.\par \par \uc2 "I have a lot on my mind and feel compelled to share some thoughts with you," he writes me from his eighth flight of the week. "I've been running since I was 16, since my Lolo [grandpa] told me my papers were fake, when he said, 'You're not supposed to be here.' But .\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09. since I am here, I better contribute and I better prove to people that I am here \u8212\'20\'14 hence my journalism. .\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09."\par \par \uc2 He arrived in Los Angeles on Aug. 3, 1993, to live with his grandfather, a security guard, and his grandmother, a food server. He had 37 relatives in this country and he was the only one among them who was not here legally. He didn't know that until he went to the DMV to apply for a driver's permit. He showed his green card and was informed it was a fake.\par \par \uc2 "I spent all of my 20s being scared s---less: scared of the government, scared of myself," he writes. "I didn't know if I could keep going, if I could keep lying."\par \par \uc2 He writes about the places he would visit if he were free to travel: the beaches of the province where he grew up; Prince Edward Island in Canada, where his favorite movie, "Anne of Green Gables," was filmed; Paris, where his hero James Baldwin wrote.\par \par \uc2 He writes now about how Americans see him \u8212\'20\'14 not as a journalist, not even as a gay man (he came out in high school, in history class), but as an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 : "We were terrorized in 9/11. Then we started terrorizing each other, with the immigrant \u8212\'20\'14 the illegal, the alien \u8212\'20\'14 as the quintessential 'other' in America."\par \par \uc2 He writes now about himself: "I feel like my life \u8212\'20\'14 my real life, a more honest life, a more fulfilling life \u8212\'20\'14 started three summers ago, when I 'outed' myself as undocumented."\par \par \uc2 But what Vargas thought would liberate him turns out to have hemmed him in. "Instead of feeling freer and relieved, I've watched him now become so burdened," says a longtime close friend, Nathalie Wade. "Ironically, because he's become this symbol of undocumented Americans, all these judgments are imposed upon him and he's lost his ability to be himself, to be unafraid. He's ended up something he never meant to be."\par \par \uc2 Vargas resists the idea that he has become a political animal: "I had a career before, and I intend to have one after," he says one day. "I am more than an immigration activist."\par \par \uc2 Two weeks later, in another conversation, he tries on a different hat: "In the detention cell, I realized this is now my life. Maybe my plan to do this for three years wasn't right. But I can't do this forever. I'm still running. But I'm not running away anymore. I'm running toward something."\par \par \uc2 Jose Vargas is pushing.\par \par \uc2 In July, Vargas went to the Texas-Mexico border to film scenes of large numbers of children arriving from Central America. He knew before he went that people within 100 miles of the border were subject to a check of their immigration status. At the airport in McAllen, Tex., as he was heading home, Vargas was stopped, questioned and taken into custody. A local reporter, tipped off by immigration activists that Vargas would be trying to get onto a plane, shot video of the encounter.\par \par \uc2 The story went viral. Some accused Vargas of staging a provocation, seeking attention for himself as much as for his cause.\par \par \uc2 "Some people in the media say it was a stunt," Vargas says, "but I needed to get out of there. And I feel like my job is to expose all the cracks in the system."\par \par \uc2 He spent eight hours in a cell with some of the children who had been pouring over the border.\par \par \uc2 Vargas calls his decision to go to McAllen an exercise in "radical transparency," of a kind with the time he called immigration authorities to ask what they intended to do with him (they had no answer).\par \par \uc2 Since his stint in detention, Vargas has worn his cordovan oxford shoes loose, with empty eyelets, because the guards took away his laces and he wants to remember his humiliation and anger.\par \par \uc2 "Undocumented people get arrested all the time," he says. "I get arrested, and it's front-page news. I feel guilt."\par \par \uc2 Even if the president's initiative stands and the threat of deportation is lifted for some, the politics of immigration remain volatile and Vargas's future is still uncertain, all of which leaves him eager to keep confronting the system. "I want to be as creatively disruptive as possible," he says. "I want to be radically transparent in a way that isn't showboating."\par \par \uc2 He is writing a memoir and recently announced a deal with \uc2 MTV\uc2  to direct a documentary on what it means to be young and white in America.\par \par \uc2 Some longtime activists on immigration issues "want Jose to be even more disruptive, more confrontational," says Gaby Pacheco, a veteran of the movement who has grown close to Vargas. "He would get pushback from kids who see him as privileged \u8212\'20\'14 he has a career, success, awards, famous friends."\par \par \uc2 But Vargas is more comfortable viewing his activism as an art form or an act of journalism. With Ryan Eller, a Baptist preacher who heard Vargas speak at a college in Indiana, he runs Define American, a nonprofit group that pushes for more liberal immigration law.\par \par \uc2 "My job is taking the artistic brilliance of Jose Vargas, this unhinged willingness to do something that feels like jumping off a bridge, and use it to build support for immigrants," says Eller. "Every day, we get requests to have Jose walk at the front of a march, join a boycott, get arrested at \uc2 the Capitol\uc2 . But that's not who Jose is."\par \par \uc2 Vargas's split identity has won over many activists who initially worried that his approach was too soft. "People saw that he could get our message out in such sophisticated ways," Pacheco says. "We've been preaching to the choir for so long, and Jose comes along and gets on 'Colbert' .\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09. and 'O'Reilly' and talks to white America. Because he is a prize-winning journalist, he has access that no immigrant had."\par \par \uc2 Jose Vargas is hiding.\par \par \uc2 In high school in Mountain View, Calif., he did everything \u8212\'20\'14 choir, debate, plays, student government, newspaper.\par \par \uc2 Soon after he learned about his immigration problem, Vargas started keeping a list of the things he needed to do to be successful. He wanted to direct a show; make a movie; write for the Wall Street Journal, \uc2 Washington Post\uc2  or \uc2 New York Times\uc2 . He wanted to win a journalism prize, cover a presidential campaign and, above all, be published in the New Yorker, which he'd discovered at the public library.\par \par \uc2 Before he turned 30, he'd done nearly everything on his list.\par \par \uc2 "That list was going to be the solution," Vargas says. "But I did all those things, and it wasn't better."\par \par \uc2 He built his supercharged escalator to success with energy, smarts, creativity, deceit and outright lies. Beginning in high school, Vargas hid his immigration status from each of his employers as he rose through his profession, winning over editors who were hungry for young talent.\par \par \uc2 "We were behind the curve on all things digital and along came Jose," says Peter Perl, a Washington Post editor who was in charge of hiring when Vargas was a summer intern in 2003. Vargas quickly established himself as an innovative, energetic reporter.\par \par \uc2 He was hired into a full-time position and became "the voice of youth in the newsroom," Perl says. "He's charming and charismatic."\par \par \uc2 But within a year of arriving at The Post, Vargas, shaking and evidently troubled, approached Perl and asked him to walk over to Lafayette Park. On a bench there, Vargas told the editor what he had not told anyone at his previous jobs, what no one at The Post had detected \u8212\'20\'14 that, according to the law, he didn't belong there.\par \par \uc2 "He was unburdening himself to a father figure," Perl says. "He didn't ask for anything."\par \par \uc2 For seven years, Perl who has since retired from The Post, told Vargas's secret to no one but his wife. (In 2011, when Vargas came clean, Perl was reprimanded, but he has no regrets about keeping silent to protect Vargas's career.)\par \par \uc2 Some of Vargas's colleagues saw in him a vital energy and a comfort with the digital world that eludes some veteran print journalists. But others felt suspicious or at least mystified.\par \par \uc2 "Jose is a man of so many layers, so many secrets," says his friend and former roommate, Ernesto Londo\u241\'00\'F1o, a former Post reporter who now works at the \uc2 New York Times\uc2 . When Londo\u241\'00\'F1o, a native of Colombia, first came to The Post, the newspaper sponsored his application for a work permit and Londo\u241\'00\'F1o confided in Vargas about "how anxious I was and how this was a shaky way to start a career." Vargas only listened.\par \par \uc2 After the two had been living together in the District for eight months, Londo\u241\'00\'F1o invited Vargas to travel to Colombia with him for a vacation. Vargas awkwardly demurred.\par \par \uc2 "I don't like travel," he said.\par \par \uc2 "I said, jokingly, 'Are you not here legally?'\u8201\'20\'09" Londo\u241\'00\'F1o recalls.\par \par \uc2 Vargas remembers the moment: "Ernesto was about to make a left at the \uc2 McDonald's\uc2  on U Street, and I heard myself lie. A week or so later, I moved out. I hated that I lied to him."\par \par \uc2 Londo\u241\'00\'F1o recalls his roommate coming to him and saying, abruptly, "\u8201\'20\'09'I can't live with you anymore.' He was very clearly overwhelmed."\par \par \uc2 Secrets shaped his friendships and his work. In 2004, Vargas wrote a story in The Post's Style section about spouses who kept big secrets from one another for years. "Secrets come in many forms," he wrote, "from the trivial to the consequential. .\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09."\par \par \uc2 At The Post, Vargas was part of a team that won the Pulitzer Prize for coverage of the shootings at \uc2 Virginia Tech\uc2 . But to protect his secret, he turned down a chance to cover the war in Iraq. When he had to interview a State Department official, he panicked about being caught at the building's security checkpoint; he called the source and asked, "Can we do the interview at Caribou [coffee shop]?"\par \par \uc2 He left The Post in 2009, worked at Huffington Post and in 2010, he landed the story that would tick off the last item on his high school list. He got \uc2 Mark Zuckerberg\uc2  to cooperate on a profile for the New Yorker. Vargas and the \uc2 Facebook\uc2  founder took a long walk in Menlo Park, Calif., "and Mark turns to me and says, 'So where are you from?'\u8201\'20\'09" Vargas recalls. "I stopped and looked at him. The simple answer was I was from the town next to there. The full answer was, 'I can't talk to my mom. I'm interviewing you, and I'm not supposed to be here.'\par \par \uc2 "I didn't say that. Instead, I gave him a blank look and continued the interview."\par \par \uc2 In December 2010, \uc2 the Senate\uc2  voted down the Dream Act, which would have created a path to citizenship for young people brought to the country illegally as children. Vargas went out for a long walk to the Brooklyn Bridge, listening to Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 2 \u8212\'20\'14 by turns delicate, melodramatic, overbearing. By the time he got back to his apartment, he says he knew he would end the lies. He hadn't seen his mother in 16 years.\par \par \uc2 "It must seem strange that somebody who seems so social and friendly could keep secrets for so long," Vargas told me. "I don't know how the hell I managed it. The moment you tell someone, you feel guilty, because you're endangering them. I was a coward. A ticking time bomb. Either someone was going to out me, or I would out myself, or I would have to shut the f--- up for the rest of my life."\par \par \uc2 He set out to write a first-person piece for his old employer, this newspaper, in which he would come out as an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . The Post assigned a team of editors to check the story rigorously; a story about lies had to be airtight.\par \par \uc2 In the end, The Post's editor at the time, Marcus Brauchli, decided not to publish the story. Vargas offered it to the \uc2 New York Times\uc2 , which put it on the cover of its Sunday magazine. Brauchli says he has nothing to add to his original explanation, which said: "We made a judgment not to run the piece."\par \par \uc2 Vargas says he thinks The Post bailed out because he had a second illegally obtained driver's license that he hadn't mentioned in his first draft. But he says he was committed to telling all and gladly added any fact the editors wanted.\par \par \uc2 Some fellow journalists read \uc2 the Times\uc2  story and felt as if they'd been made unwitting parties to a lie.\par \par \uc2 "I was duped," wrote \uc2 Phil Bronstein\uc2 , editor of the San Francisco Chronicle, where Vargas had worked at the start of his career. "Jose lied to me and everyone else he worked for, and that's not kosher."\par \par \uc2 The Post's ombudsman then, \uc2 Patrick Pexton\uc2 , wrote that Vargas had a reputation in the newsroom "for being tenacious and talented but also for being a relentless self-promoter whom many colleagues didn't trust." Pexton concluded that Vargas had now "crossed the line from journalist to advocate."\par \par \uc2 The Times\uc2  story would liberate Vargas from the constant elisions and deceptions, but not from life on the run. Soon after the piece appeared, Washington state revoked his driver's license, which he had obtained illegally (he had never lived in the state). These days, he gets around by cadging rides from friends and supporters. He takes a lot of taxis.\par \par \uc2 When a student attending a speech at \uc2 American University\uc2  asks him where he lives now, he replies, "On \uc2 Delta Air Lines\uc2 ."\par \par \uc2 Jose Vargas is charming.\par \par \uc2 Wade, his friend since freshman year of high school, remembers coming home to find Vargas on her couch \u8212\'20\'14 he had a key to her house \u8212\'20\'14 watching videotapes of figure skater Michelle Kwan that her mother had recorded for Jose.\par \par \uc2 "He was really building a family for himself," Wade says, "reaching out to adults to be mother figures."\par \par \uc2 Pat Hyland, Vargas's high school principal, first focused on him as he fell into crisis after coming out as gay in school, leading his grandfather to throw him out of the house. Now, as Vargas lived from couch to couch, walking five miles a day because he didn't have money for a bus pass, the principal says she saw him survive "by making people around him feel like the center of the world."\par \par \uc2 "His head tilts like a puppy, and he's listening and asking good questions," says Hyland, now dean of students at Foothill College in Los Altos Hills, Calif. "At the same time, he had this constant, nagging sense that he was not good enough. He would constantly seek affirmation. That can get tedious. But he's so inquisitive, so resourceful \u8212\'20\'14 and so fearful. If everything you've got about yourself is a secret, you're pretty lonely."\par \par \uc2 Vargas's fellow interns watched as he impressed his editors. "He had a way to ingratiate himself to people in authority to stay afloat," Londo\u241\'00\'F1o says. "It's what he's always done to survive. He has this huge desire to belong, because there was this big part of him that didn't."\par \par \uc2 Marcia Davis, who edited Vargas in the Style section and became a close friend, says some bosses mistook his fear about his fragile immigration status for being manipulative.\par \par \uc2 "He connects to a \uc2 Don Graham\uc2 , an \uc2 Arianna Huffington\uc2 , a \uc2 Mark Zuckerberg\uc2 , because he lives in a world of big ideas and he's got the passion of a young person," she says. "This idea of him being a self-promoter: I really think issues of race and class factored into people saying that about him. There's anxiety in Jose, there's self-doubt, and it can all be exhausting. But he's passionate about telling stories, so full of wanting to get things done."\par \par \uc2 Vargas arrives at \uc2 American University\uc2  to give a speech. Stopping by the student TV station, he checks his hair ("I learned early on that I can't look like I'm stressed out," he says), and then, when a young woman tells him he inspired her to open up about her undocumented status, he lowers his voice, tilts his head and spends 30 seconds with her as if there weren't 11 other people in the room.\par \par \uc2 In a quiet moment between speeches, he says he collected parental figures \u8212\'20\'14 for a purpose.\par \par \uc2 "I traffic in empathy," Vargas says. "I try to be vulnerable with people so they can be vulnerable back. I've always been searching for empathy in other people. It's when I feel most not alone."\par \par \uc2 Vargas is running, still. He came out as gay and still felt compelled to run. Came out as undocumented \u8212\'20\'14 still running. He finally admitted to himself that he has a mother (for years, he'd refused her request to be listed as his parent on \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , for fear that people would ask questions \u8212\'20\'14 "Do you miss her? Why don't you go see her?" He kept a shoe box full of her letters, unopened). As yet, no rest.\par \par \uc2 Even now, he holds secrets, about things he did as a young man, about his family, about why he runs. In his mind, he keeps a catalogue of which friends he's told which secrets. He's not sure he remembers who knows what.\par \par \uc2 His hardest moment so far was reconnecting with his mother, Emelie Salinas. Vargas spent nearly three years working on his film, "Documented," which ends with an extended passage about his first visit with his mother via Skype. (She has applied three times for a tourist visa to visit her son. She has been turned down each time.)\par \par \uc2 Footage of his mother did not appear in early cuts of the movie. Now, he sees, "she is the film. She's this mother who put me on a plane. She and I meet on film."\par \par \uc2 After he finally decided that the movie could not be fully honest without her, Vargas spent weeks working with the 10 hours of footage his crew brought back from the Philippines. As soon as he finished editing his mother into the film, he did something he'd thought about for a decade: He went to see a therapist.\par \par \uc2 "I've become a little more open in the past few months about depression," he says.\par \par \uc2 These days, mother and son chat on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  from time to time. The conversation is not easy. The anger he felt toward her for sending him away has subsided, but there's only so much he can repair from 7,000 miles away.\par \par \uc2 He remains afraid of the dark. He doesn't sleep \u8212\'20\'14 just short bits here and there. He keeps no pictures of himself.\par \par \uc2 Vargas is forever coming out, revealing himself layer by layer, yet always holding something in reserve.\par \par \uc2 Londo\u241\'00\'F1o, his former roommate, came to believe that Vargas is a good man imprisoned by his silence. "His secrets came to dominate and poison every aspect of his life," says Londo\u241\'00\'F1o, who remains on good terms with Vargas. "He could never let anybody get close. It kept him from having a real romantic relationship. He was lonely, hugely lonely."\par \par \uc2 Vargas confirms he has never had a serious partner. "I just never really allowed that," he says. "It would be unfair to impose that on someone else."\par \par \uc2 In high school, after his grandfather kicked him out, he lived for a time with a middle-aged man he'd met at a coffee shop, his first steady relationship. He says the relationship was not abusive, but consensual and convenient.\par \par \uc2 "If he was taking advantage of me, I was also taking advantage of him," Vargas says. "I had a place to sleep, right?"\par \par \uc2 He didn't tell even his closest friends about the man. "I didn't want them to know," he says. "What am I supposed to do, tell them I'm sleeping with a man to have somewhere to sleep? That's putting a lot on them."\par \par \uc2 Even now, his old friend Nathalie Wade says: "Jose will come to a point where he pushes people away if somebody gets too close. It's hard to let somebody love you when you don't think as highly of yourself as you could."\par \par \uc2 In his apartment, Vargas keeps a globe, a symbol of the places he wants to see someday.\par \par \uc2 Hyland, his high school principal, hopes Vargas will finally come to rest: "He's on a race with no particular end. He thinks if he just talks to enough people, they'll see the problem. That's just not going to work. Does he have the energy to sustain the work without seeing progress? I don't know. You begin to repeat yourself."\par \par \uc2 She's not optimistic that he can stop. "No one has the authority to tell him to take a timeout," she says. "It would scare him."\par \par \uc2 Wade sent Vargas a note after she saw his documentary. She said she understood now "why you are the way you are. Of course, someone with something to prove, someone who constantly needs to show that he belongs .\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09. would need to achieve, and surpass, and impress to no end. .\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09.\par \par \uc2 "You are constantly striving to find ways .\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09. to be loved by more and more people around you when the most important person, the one person who would make you feel whole again .\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09. is separated from you by such deep geographical, emotional and especially political lines."\par \par \uc2 In every Skype conversation, his mother assures her son that he is worthy, good, accepted. In his movie, she tells the film crew he sent that "more than anything else, I want to be able to, like any mom, embrace my child, even without words. I just want to be able to hug him, like I did before."\par \par \uc2 Her son wants the same thing, and now he believes it will happen. He called her on Skype after Obama's speech. It was a short conversation with a simple message. "I'm going to try to see you," he said, "and there would be no cameras. No, no, no, no, no."\par \par \uc2 marc.fisher@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020141124eabo0008e\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

That's not how our system works."\b0\par\par\uc2 407 \uc2 words\par \uc2 24 November 2014\par \uc2 The Washington Post\par \uc2 WP\par \uc2 FINAL\par A02\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2014, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved   \par \par \uc2 - President Obama, responding Friday to critics of his move to defer deportations for as many as 5 million undocumented immigrants - nearly half the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  population. Obama repeatedly urged \uc2 Congress\uc2 , if it didn't like his move, to "pass a bill."\par \par \uc2 46 The Kaiser poll showed that 46 percent of the public said they had a negative opinion of the health-care law, compared with 37 percent who said they held a positive opinion. Republicans continue to oppose the health-care law while Democrats embrace it. In short, even as news around the law develops and changes, opinions about it aren't budging much.\par \par \uc2 1 If \uc2 Hillary Rodham Clinton\uc2  runs for president, she may have at least one credible challenger for the Democratic nomination. Former senator James Webb (D-Va.) announced last week that he was forming a presidential exploratory committee. Clinton is still expected to be the overwhelming Democratic frontrunner if she runs. But Webb's decision is a reminder that there are elements of the party not fully behind a Clinton candidacy.\par \par \uc2 14Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-La.) can thank her own party for her Keystone XL pipeline embarrassment. Just 14 \uc2 Senate\uc2  Democrats voted for the measure. Meanwhile, all 45 \uc2 Senate\uc2  Republicans backed it.\par \par \uc2 Sen. \uc2 Mary Landrieu\uc2 's (D-La.) Keystone gambit backfired. Landrieu, faced with an almost unwinnable runoff Dec. 6, sought to prove her clout by getting the oil pipeline passed through \uc2 the Senate\uc2 . She came up one vote shy, looking even weaker in her matchup with Rep. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) than she did beforehand. Oh, and never mind the fact that Keystone will pass in the GOP-controlled \uc2 Senate\uc2  come January - and that President Obama simply would have vetoed it anyway. So, basically, it was a meaningless tactic that failed miserably.\par \par \uc2 Their Jonathan Gruber offensive got traction. Gruber's comments that Obamacare passed with an assist from "the stupidity of the American voter" continued to complicate life for Democrats, who basically disowned Gruber at the start of the week - just as the next Obamacare enrollment period was starting. The good news for Democrats is it doesn't appear to have affected the overall approval of the law. A \uc2 Kaiser Family Foundation\uc2  poll at the end of the week showed that support and opposition were both steady despite the furor over Gruber's comments.\par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com\par \par \uc2 WP20141124MondayFixBreakbox1124\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020141124eabo0000s\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved   \par \par \uc2 Willis Bretz For The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2  Since publicly disclosing his undocumented status in 2011, Jose Antonio Vargas, a former \uc2 Washington Post\uc2  reporter, has worked with Define American, the organization he founded to work on immigration policy.\par \par \uc2 Jose Antonio Vargas is running. He's fresh off the red-eye from California to Dulles - his third overnight flight in as many weeks - to deliver yet another speech. He grabs his backpack and goes, delivering nearly 300 talks in 44 states over the past three years. He has moved, in just five years, from Washington to New York to San Francisco. He's in a hurry to convince his fellow Americans that people like him should be considered fellow Americans.\par \par \uc2 Vargas, 33, has always been running, since he found out at 16 that he was in the United States illegally, and before that too, as a child whose mother put her 12-year-old on a plane from the Philippines to California, telling him that if anyone asked where he was going, he should say "Disneyland." He hasn't seen her since.\par \par \uc2 He runs because it got him to where he is. When he was a 27-year-old reporter at The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2 , his editors assigned him to cover the 2008 presidential campaign because they thought he could see what young voters were thinking. \uc2 ABC\uc2 's \uc2 Diane Sawyer\uc2  called him "one of the most successful young men in this country." \uc2 Arianna Huffington\uc2  hired him to help her Huffington Post staff connect with digital natives.\par \par \uc2 He runs because he never knows when the immigration authorities or the Border Patrol or any cop in the land might grab him, as they did this summer in Texas, tossing him in a cell for eight hours. Vargas has never had a valid visa or green card; he used to travel with an illegally obtained driver's license and, after 2011, a Philippines passport. Now, he has been ordered to pass through \uc2 Transportation Security Administration\uc2  checkpoints using the oddest of travel documents, a "Warrant for Arrest of Alien" on U.S. Border Patrol letterhead. It says Vargas is "within the country in violation of the immigration laws and is liable to being taken into custody." He keeps it in his backpack. He calls the document "my first American papers."\par \par \uc2 Vargas runs because he has much to prove, even after a meteoric rise as a reporter; even after he achieved his golden ambition, a piece in the New Yorker; even after a sudden flip from journalism to activism and instant celebrity in that field - the cover of Time, live coverage on \uc2 CNN\uc2  of his arrest in July. And yes, even after Thursday night, when President Obama announced his move to at least temporarily lift the threat of deportation from millions of illegal immigrants, including Vargas.\par \par \uc2 "So now I get a real work permit for the first time in my life?" he says a few hours after the president's address to the nation. "I get a driver's license? I get to see my mom? Is that how it works? It feels real to me, even if it's temporary."\par \par \uc2 He runs even now, because there are millions of undocumented immigrants whose status remains unchanged by Obama's executive action. He runs because he misses his mother and has no idea when he will be able to see her. And because if he slows down, his secrets might catch up to him. And because to stop would be to face the depths of his loneliness.\par \par \uc2 Bonnie Jo Mount \uc2 WASHINGTON POST\uc2  Vargas has moved, in just five years, from Washington to New York to San Francisco but spends much of his time on the road. Here, he is pictured en route to D.C. from New York in 2011.\par \par \uc2 Joseiswriting. That's his \uc2 Twitter\uc2  handle. He tweets, e-mails, writes essays, scripts, speeches and stories. It's 6:17 a.m. and Vargas is flying from Chicago - where he'd been for 36 hours, giving two talks about immigration - to San Francisco, where he'll be for 18 hours before another red-eye to Washington, where he'll spend eight hours, then jump on \uc2 Amtrak\uc2  to New York.\par \par \uc2 "I have a lot on my mind and feel compelled to share some thoughts with you," he writes me from his eighth flight of the week. "I've been running since I was 16, since my Lolo [grandpa] told me my papers were fake, when he said, 'You're not supposed to be here.' But . . . since I am here, I better contribute and I better prove to people that I am here - hence my journalism. . . ."\par \par \uc2 He arrived in Los Angeles on Aug. 3, 1993, to live with his grandfather, a security guard, and his grandmother, a food server. He had 37 relatives in this country and he was the only one among them who was not here legally. He didn't know that until he went to the DMV to apply for a driver's permit. He showed his green card and was informed it was a fake.\par \par \uc2 "I spent all of my 20s being scared s---less: scared of the government, scared of myself," he writes. "I didn't know if I could keep going, if I could keep lying."\par \par \uc2 He writes about the places he would visit if he were free to travel: the beaches of the province where he grew up; Prince Edward Island in Canada, where his favorite movie, "Anne of Green Gables," was filmed; Paris, where his hero James Baldwin wrote.\par \par \uc2 He writes now about how Americans see him - not as a journalist, not even as a gay man (he came out in high school, in history class), but as an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 : "We were terrorized in 9/11. Then we started terrorizing each other, with the immigrant - the illegal, the alien - as the quintessential 'other' in America."\par \par \uc2 He writes now about himself: "I feel like my life - my real life, a more honest life, a more fulfilling life - started three summers ago, when I 'outed' myself as undocumented."\par \par \uc2 But what Vargas thought would liberate him turns out to have hemmed him in. "Instead of feeling freer and relieved, I've watched him now become so burdened," says a longtime close friend, Nathalie Wade. "Ironically, because he's become this symbol of undocumented Americans, all these judgments are imposed upon him and he's lost his ability to be himself, to be unafraid. He's ended up something he never meant to be."\par \par \uc2 Vargas resists the idea that he has become a political animal: "I had a career before, and I intend to have one after," he says one day. "I am more than an immigration activist."\par \par \uc2 Two weeks later, in another conversation, he tries on a different hat: "In the detention cell, I realized this is now my life. Maybe my plan to do this for three years wasn't right. But I can't do this forever. I'm still running. But I'm not running away anymore. I'm running toward something."\par \par \uc2 Jacquelyn Martin Associated Press In June 2012, Vargas and other undocumented immigrants were pictured on the cover of Time magazine.\par \par \uc2 Jose Vargas is pushing.\par \par \uc2 In July, Vargas went to the Texas-Mexico border to film scenes of large numbers of children arriving from Central America. He knew before he went that people within 100 miles of the border were subject to a check of their immigration status. At the airport in McAllen, Tex., as he was heading home, Vargas was stopped, questioned and taken into custody. A local reporter, tipped off by immigration activists that Vargas would be trying to get onto a plane, shot video of the encounter.\par \par \uc2 The story went viral. Some accused Vargas of staging a provocation, seeking attention for himself as much as for his cause.\par \par \uc2 "Some people in the media say it was a stunt," Vargas says, "but I needed to get out of there. And I feel like my job is to expose all the cracks in the system."\par \par \uc2 He spent eight hours in a cell with some of the children who had been pouring over the border.\par \par \uc2 Vargas calls his decision to go to McAllen an exercise in "radical transparency," of a kind with the time he called immigration authorities to ask what they intended to do with him (they had no answer).\par \par \uc2 Since his stint in detention, Vargas has worn his cordovan oxford shoes loose, with empty eyelets, because the guards took away his laces and he wants to remember his humiliation and anger.\par \par \uc2 "Undocumented people get arrested all the time," he says. "I get arrested, and it's front-page news. I feel guilt."\par \par \uc2 Even if the president's initiative stands and the threat of deportation is lifted for some, the politics of immigration remain volatile and Vargas's future is still uncertain, all of which leaves him eager to keep confronting the system. "I want to be as creatively disruptive as possible," he says. "I want to be radically transparent in a way that isn't showboating."\par \par \uc2 He is writing a memoir and recently announced a deal with MTV to direct a documentary on what it means to be young and white in America.\par \par \uc2 Some longtime activists on immigration issues "want Jose to be even more disruptive, more confrontational," says Gaby Pacheco, a veteran of the movement who has grown close to Vargas. "He would get pushback from kids who see him as privileged - he has a career, success, awards, famous friends."\par \par \uc2 But Vargas is more comfortable viewing his activism as an art form or an act of journalism. With Ryan Eller, a Baptist preacher who heard Vargas speak at a college in Indiana, he runs Define American, a nonprofit group that pushes for more liberal immigration law.\par \par \uc2 "My job is taking the artistic brilliance of Jose Vargas, this unhinged willingness to do something that feels like jumping off a bridge, and use it to build support for immigrants," says Eller. "Every day, we get requests to have Jose walk at the front of a march, join a boycott, get arrested at \uc2 the Capitol\uc2 . But that's not who Jose is."\par \par \uc2 Vargas's split identity has won over many activists who initially worried that his approach was too soft. "People saw that he could get our message out in such sophisticated ways," Pacheco says. "We've been preaching to the choir for so long, and Jose comes along and gets on 'Colbert' . . . and 'O'Reilly' and talks to white America. Because he is a prize-winning journalist, he has access that no immigrant had."\par \par \uc2 Copy photo Vargas still has a copy of the Philippine passport he traveled with as a 12-year-old. Family Photo In this 2004 family photo to celebrate his college graduation, Vargas poses with his grandfather, Teofilo "Ted" Salinas.\par \par \uc2 Jose Vargas is hiding.\par \par \uc2 In high school in Mountain View, Calif., he did everything - choir, debate, plays, student government, newspaper.\par \par \uc2 Soon after he learned about his immigration problem, Vargas started keeping a list of the things he needed to do to be successful. He wanted to direct a show; make a movie; write for the Wall Street Journal, \uc2 Washington Post\uc2  or \uc2 New York Times\uc2 . He wanted to win a journalism prize, cover a presidential campaign and, above all, be published in the New Yorker, which he'd discovered at the public library.\par \par \uc2 Before he turned 30, he'd done nearly everything on his list.\par \par \uc2 "That list was going to be the solution," Vargas says. "But I did all those things, and it wasn't better."\par \par \uc2 He built his supercharged escalator to success with energy, smarts, creativity, deceit and outright lies. Beginning in high school, Vargas hid his immigration status from each of his employers as he rose through his profession, winning over editors who were hungry for young talent.\par \par \uc2 "We were behind the curve on all things digital and along came Jose," says Peter Perl, a Washington Post editor who was in charge of hiring when Vargas was a summer intern in 2003. Vargas quickly established himself as an innovative, energetic reporter.\par \par \uc2 He was hired into a full-time position and became "the voice of youth in the newsroom," Perl says. "He's charming and charismatic."\par \par \uc2 But within a year of arriving at The Post, Vargas, shaking and evidently troubled, approached Perl and asked him to walk over to Lafayette Park. On a bench there, Vargas told the editor what he had not told anyone at his previous jobs, what no one at The Post had detected - that, according to the law, he didn't belong there.\par \par \uc2 "He was unburdening himself to a father figure," Perl says. "He didn't ask for anything."\par \par \uc2 For seven years, Perl who has since retired from The Post, told Vargas's secret to no one but his wife. (In 2011, when Vargas came clean, Perl was reprimanded, but he has no regrets about keeping silent to protect Vargas's career.)\par \par \uc2 Some of Vargas's colleagues saw in him a vital energy and a comfort with the digital world that eludes some veteran print journalists. But others felt suspicious or at least mystified.\par \par \uc2 "Jose is a man of so many layers, so many secrets," says his friend and former roommate, Ernesto Londo\u241\'00\'F1o, a former Post reporter who now works at the \uc2 New York Times\uc2 . When Londo\u241\'00\'F1o, a native of Colombia, first came to The Post, the newspaper sponsored his application for a work permit and Londo\u241\'00\'F1o confided in Vargas about "how anxious I was and how this was a shaky way to start a career." Vargas only listened.\par \par \uc2 After the two had been living together in the District for eight months, Londo\u241\'00\'F1o invited Vargas to travel to Colombia with him for a vacation. Vargas awkwardly demurred.\par \par \uc2 "I don't like travel," he said.\par \par \uc2 "I said, jokingly, 'Are you not here legally?' " Londo\u241\'00\'F1o recalls.\par \par \uc2 Vargas remembers the moment: "Ernesto was about to make a left at the \uc2 McDonald's\uc2  on U Street, and I heard myself lie. A week or so later, I moved out. I hated that I lied to him."\par \par \uc2 Londo\u241\'00\'F1o recalls his roommate coming to him and saying, abruptly, " 'I can't live with you anymore.' He was very clearly overwhelmed."\par \par \uc2 Secrets shaped his friendships and his work. In 2004, Vargas wrote a story in The Post's Style section about spouses who kept big secrets from one another for years. "Secrets come in many forms," he wrote, "from the trivial to the consequential. . . ."\par \par \uc2 At The Post, Vargas was part of a team that won the Pulitzer Prize for coverage of the shootings at \uc2 Virginia Tech\uc2 . But to protect his secret, he turned down a chance to cover the war in Iraq. When he had to interview a State Department official, he panicked about being caught at the building's security checkpoint; he called the source and asked, "Can we do the interview at Caribou [coffee shop]?"\par \par \uc2 He left The Post in 2009, worked at Huffington Post and in 2010, he landed the story that would tick off the last item on his high school list. He got \uc2 Mark Zuckerberg\uc2  to cooperate on a profile for the New Yorker. Vargas and the \uc2 Facebook\uc2  founder took a long walk in Menlo Park, Calif., "and Mark turns to me and says, 'So where are you from?' " Vargas recalls. "I stopped and looked at him. The simple answer was I was from the town next to there. The full answer was, 'I can't talk to my mom. I'm interviewing you, and I'm not supposed to be here.'\par \par \uc2 "I didn't say that. Instead, I gave him a blank look and continued the interview."\par \par \uc2 In December 2010, the Senate voted down the Dream Act, which would have created a path to citizenship for young people brought to the country illegally as children. Vargas went out for a long walk to the Brooklyn Bridge, listening to Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 2 - by turns delicate, melodramatic, overbearing. By the time he got back to his apartment, he says he knew he would end the lies. He hadn't seen his mother in 16 years.\par \par \uc2 "It must seem strange that somebody who seems so social and friendly could keep secrets for so long," Vargas told me. "I don't know how the hell I managed it. The moment you tell someone, you feel guilty, because you're endangering them. I was a coward. A ticking time bomb. Either someone was going to out me, or I would out myself, or I would have to shut the f--- up for the rest of my life."\par \par \uc2 He set out to write a first-person piece for his old employer, this newspaper, in which he would come out as an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . The Post assigned a team of editors to check the story rigorously; a story about lies had to be airtight.\par \par \uc2 In the end, The Post's editor at the time, Marcus Brauchli, decided not to publish the story. Vargas offered it to the \uc2 New York Times\uc2 , which put it on the cover of its Sunday magazine. Brauchli says he has nothing to add to his original explanation, which said: "We made a judgment not to run the piece."\par \par \uc2 Vargas says he thinks The Post bailed out because he had a second illegally obtained driver's license that he hadn't mentioned in his first draft. But he says he was committed to telling all and gladly added any fact the editors wanted.\par \par \uc2 Some fellow journalists read the Times story and felt as if they'd been made unwitting parties to a lie.\par \par \uc2 "I was duped," wrote \uc2 Phil Bronstein\uc2 , editor of the San Francisco Chronicle, where Vargas had worked at the start of his career. "Jose lied to me and everyone else he worked for, and that's not kosher."\par \par \uc2 The Post's ombudsman then, \uc2 Patrick Pexton\uc2 , wrote that Vargas had a reputation in the newsroom "for being tenacious and talented but also for being a relentless self-promoter whom many colleagues didn't trust." Pexton concluded that Vargas had now "crossed the line from journalist to advocate."\par \par \uc2 The Times\uc2  story would liberate Vargas from the constant elisions and deceptions, but not from life on the run. Soon after the piece appeared, Washington state revoked his driver's license, which he had obtained illegally (he had never lived in the state). These days, he gets around by cadging rides from friends and supporters. He takes a lot of taxis.\par \par \uc2 When a student attending a speech at \uc2 American University\uc2  asks him where he lives now, he replies, "On \uc2 Delta Air Lines\uc2 ."\par \par \uc2 Saul Loeb Agence France-Presse via \uc2 Getty Images\uc2  Vargas, holding a pocket copy of the U.S. Constitution, joined civil rights leaders and immigration reform activists for a news conference on Nov. 20, ahead of the president's announcement of his executive action on immigration.\par \par \uc2 Jose Vargas is charming.\par \par \uc2 Wade, his friend since freshman year of high school, remembers coming home to find Vargas on her couch - he had a key to her house - watching videotapes of figure skater Michelle Kwan that her mother had recorded for Jose.\par \par \uc2 "He was really building a family for himself," Wade says, "reaching out to adults to be mother figures."\par \par \uc2 Pat Hyland, Vargas's high school principal, first focused on him as he fell into crisis after coming out as gay in school, leading his grandfather to throw him out of the house. Now, as Vargas lived from couch to couch, walking five miles a day because he didn't have money for a bus pass, the principal says she saw him survive "by making people around him feel like the center of the world."\par \par \uc2 "His head tilts like a puppy, and he's listening and asking good questions," says Hyland, now dean of students at Foothill College in Los Altos Hills, Calif. "At the same time, he had this constant, nagging sense that he was not good enough. He would constantly seek affirmation. That can get tedious. But he's so inquisitive, so resourceful - and so fearful. If everything you've got about yourself is a secret, you're pretty lonely."\par \par \uc2 Vargas's fellow interns watched as he impressed his editors. "He had a way to ingratiate himself to people in authority to stay afloat," Londo\u241\'00\'F1o says. "It's what he's always done to survive. He has this huge desire to belong, because there was this big part of him that didn't."\par \par \uc2 Marcia Davis, who edited Vargas in the Style section and became a close friend, says some bosses mistook his fear about his fragile immigration status for being manipulative.\par \par \uc2 "He connects to a \uc2 Don Graham\uc2 , an \uc2 Arianna Huffington\uc2 , a \uc2 Mark Zuckerberg\uc2 , because he lives in a world of big ideas and he's got the passion of a young person," she says. "This idea of him being a self-promoter: I really think issues of race and class factored into people saying that about him. There's anxiety in Jose, there's self-doubt, and it can all be exhausting. But he's passionate about telling stories, so full of wanting to get things done."\par \par \uc2 Vargas arrives at \uc2 American University\uc2  to give a speech. Stopping by the student TV station, he checks his hair ("I learned early on that I can't look like I'm stressed out," he says), and then, when a young woman tells him he inspired her to open up about her undocumented status, he lowers his voice, tilts his head and spends 30 seconds with her as if there weren't 11 other people in the room.\par \par \uc2 In a quiet moment between speeches, he says he collected parental figures - for a purpose.\par \par \uc2 "I traffic in empathy," Vargas says. "I try to be vulnerable with people so they can be vulnerable back. I've always been searching for empathy in other people. It's when I feel most not alone."\par \par \uc2 Apo Anak Productions/Define American "Documented" is a film written and directed by Jose Antonio Vargas, an undocumented American - one of the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States.\par \par \uc2 Vargas is running, still. He came out as gay and still felt compelled to run. Came out as undocumented - still running. He finally admitted to himself that he has a mother (for years, he'd refused her request to be listed as his parent on \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , for fear that people would ask questions - "Do you miss her? Why don't you go see her?" He kept a shoe box full of her letters, unopened). As yet, no rest.\par \par \uc2 Even now, he holds secrets, about things he did as a young man, about his family, about why he runs. In his mind, he keeps a catalogue of which friends he's told which secrets. He's not sure he remembers who knows what.\par \par \uc2 His hardest moment so far was reconnecting with his mother, Emelie Salinas. Vargas spent nearly three years working on his film, "Documented," which ends with an extended passage about his first visit with his mother via Skype. (She has applied three times for a tourist visa to visit her son. She has been turned down each time.)\par \par \uc2 Footage of his mother did not appear in early cuts of the movie. Now, he sees, "she is the film. She's this mother who put me on a plane. She and I meet on film."\par \par \uc2 After he finally decided that the movie could not be fully honest without her, Vargas spent weeks working with the 10 hours of footage his crew brought back from the Philippines. As soon as he finished editing his mother into the film, he did something he'd thought about for a decade: He went to see a therapist.\par \par \uc2 "I've become a little more open in the past few months about depression," he says.\par \par \uc2 These days, mother and son chat on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  from time to time. The conversation is not easy. The anger he felt toward her for sending him away has subsided, but there's only so much he can repair from 7,000 miles away.\par \par \uc2 He remains afraid of the dark. He doesn't sleep - just short bits here and there. He keeps no pictures of himself.\par \par \uc2 Vargas is forever coming out, revealing himself layer by layer, yet always holding something in reserve.\par \par \uc2 Londo\u241\'00\'F1o, his former roommate, came to believe that Vargas is a good man imprisoned by his silence. "His secrets came to dominate and poison every aspect of his life," says Londo\u241\'00\'F1o, who remains on good terms with Vargas. "He could never let anybody get close. It kept him from having a real romantic relationship. He was lonely, hugely lonely."\par \par \uc2 Vargas confirms he has never had a serious partner. "I just never really allowed that," he says. "It would be unfair to impose that on someone else."\par \par \uc2 In high school, after his grandfather kicked him out, he lived for a time with a middle-aged man he'd met at a coffee shop, his first steady relationship. He says the relationship was not abusive, but consensual and convenient.\par \par \uc2 "If he was taking advantage of me, I was also taking advantage of him," Vargas says. "I had a place to sleep, right?"\par \par \uc2 He didn't tell even his closest friends about the man. "I didn't want them to know," he says. "What am I supposed to do, tell them I'm sleeping with a man to have somewhere to sleep? That's putting a lot on them."\par \par \uc2 Even now, his old friend Nathalie Wade says: "Jose will come to a point where he pushes people away if somebody gets too close. It's hard to let somebody love you when you don't think as highly of yourself as you could."\par \par \uc2 In his apartment, Vargas keeps a globe, a symbol of the places he wants to see someday.\par \par \uc2 Hyland, his high school principal, hopes Vargas will finally come to rest: "He's on a race with no particular end. He thinks if he just talks to enough people, they'll see the problem. That's just not going to work. Does he have the energy to sustain the work without seeing progress? I don't know. You begin to repeat yourself."\par \par \uc2 She's not optimistic that he can stop. "No one has the authority to tell him to take a timeout," she says. "It would scare him."\par \par \uc2 Wade sent Vargas a note after she saw his documentary. She said she understood now "why you are the way you are. Of course, someone with something to prove, someone who constantly needs to show that he belongs . . . would need to achieve, and surpass, and impress to no end. . . .\par \par \uc2 "You are constantly striving to find ways . . . to be loved by more and more people around you when the most important person, the one person who would make you feel whole again . . . is separated from you by such deep geographical, emotional and especially political lines."\par \par \uc2 In every Skype conversation, his mother assures her son that he is worthy, good, accepted. In his movie, she tells the film crew he sent that "more than anything else, I want to be able to, like any mom, embrace my child, even without words. I just want to be able to hug him, like I did before."\par \par \uc2 Her son wants the same thing, and now he believes it will happen. He called her on Skype after Obama's speech. It was a short conversation with a simple message. "I'm going to try to see you," he said, "and there would be no cameras. No, no, no, no, no."\par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com\par \par \uc2 WP20141124vargas\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020141124eabo0000a\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The most telling indictment of\u160\'00\'A0the president's unilateral action comes from the Office of Legal Counsel's memo. Liberal apologists for the White House citing the memo as justification of the president's action should read it and compare it to the president's explanation of what is actually going to occur.\u160\'00\'A0Conservative legal gurus\u160\'00\'A0have been\u160\'00\'A0scouring the memo\u160\'00\'A0and have uncovered some interesting trip wires which the president failed to sidestep.\par \par \uc2 The OLC memo recognizes that under the guise of prosecutorial discretion the executive cannot enact broad legislative edicts ("a general policy of non-enforcement that forecloses the exercise of case-by-case\u160\'00\'A0discretion poses 'special risks' that the agency has exceeded the bounds of its enforcement discretion").\u160\'00\'A0It finds the action legal insofar that it "provides for\u160\'00\'A0case-by-case determinations about whether an individual alien's circumstances\u160\'00\'A0warrant the expenditure of removal resources, employing a broad standard that\u160\'00\'A0leaves ample room for the exercise of individualized discretion by responsible\u160\'00\'A0officials." Oops. That is precisely what is NOT going on here.\par \par \uc2 A further hint that the administration strayed into the danger zone comes in footnote 8:\par \par \uc2 Before DACA was announced, our Office was consulted about whether such a program would be legally permissible. As we orally advised, our preliminary view was that such a program would be permissible, provided that immigration officials retained discretion to evaluate each application on an individualized basis. We noted that immigration officials typically consider factors such as having been brought to the United States as a child in exercising their discretion to grant deferred action in individual cases. We explained, however, that extending deferred action to individuals who satisfied these and other specified criteria on a class-wide basis would raise distinct questions not implicated by ad hoc grants of deferred action. We advised that it was critical that, like past policies that made deferred action available to certain classes of aliens, the DACA program require immigration officials to evaluate each application for deferred action on a case-by-case basis, rather than granting deferred action automatically to all applicants who satisfied the threshold eligibility criteria.\par \par \uc2 But did the president do this? No. (No wonder the advice was oral.) In his speech he told the country: "If you've been in America more than five years. If you have children who are American citizens or illegal residents. If you register, pass a criminal background check and you're willing to pay your fair share of taxes, you'll be able to apply to stay in this country temporarily without fear of deportation. You can come out of the shadows and get right with the law. That's what this deal is."\par \par \uc2 As lawyer Josh Blackman argues, "[T]he OLC memo makes a very strong effort at crafting a line between prosecutorial discretion and abuse of discretion. While there are many citations to Heckler v. Chaney, the argument\u160\'00\'A0boils down to this point: when deferrals must be made on a case-by-case basis, this does not amount to an abdication\u160\'00\'A0of enforcing the law, and a transformation into rewriting the law." The president is doing what the OLC and Heckler said\u160\'00\'A0he could not, "A decision not to enforce the deportation law against roughly half the nation's \uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2  population looks like an abdication to us and would seem so to a Court faithfully applying\u160\'00\'A0Heckler."\par \par \uc2 The decision to exempt millions of people from deportation of course only works if there is a certain, across the board rule. Otherwise who would come forward and risk deportation? The certainty they require is what Heckler says the executive cannot provide.\par \par \uc2 One fruitful exercise of congressional inquiry should be then to determine what individualized consideration is going on here and which people who fit within the categories are not receiving delayed deportation. If everyone in the broad category gets approved then it is not a case-by-case examination and by the OLC's own admission could not be legal. This inquiry would be a service to the public, but also provide the factual basis for challenging the action in court.\par \par \uc2 On that front, states may be in the best position to challenge the president in court. \uc2 John Yoo\uc2  and Robert Delahunty write:\par \par \uc2 States, especially those along the nation's borders, will expend more money and resources on the illegal aliens in their jurisdictions. They will have to spend more on police and social services, such as education and health care. Just as Massachusetts could sue to force the Bush administration to enforce its preferred understanding of the Clean Air Act, so states today should be able to sue to force the Obama administration to enforce the immigration laws. In the 1990s, the state of California sued the Clinton administration for failing to enforce the immigration laws under a similar theory. While the case never made it to the \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2 , the lower courts did not reject the case for lack of standing (though they did dismiss it because California founded its case on the U.S.'s responsibility to protect the states from invasion).\par \par \uc2 States attorneys general should get cracking on their lawsuits, but that should not stop \uc2 Congress\uc2  from acting. In discrete funding riders, it can do its best to disassociate itself from the president's actions, making it that much clearer that this is not presidential discretion in enforcing the laws but executive defiance of the laws. Together with censure, the \uc2 Congress\uc2  can make a powerful statement the president has overstepped.\par \par \uc2 Ultimately, just as in Obamacare, the real remedy is at the ballot box. Democratic lawmakers who support this farce will face the voters and the presidential race can determine whether we want a president whose views of executive discretion are so broad as to defy \uc2 Congress\uc2  and create edicts that substitute \u160\'00\'A0for legisation. In essence, the Republicans should run on retract (the executive action) and replace with common sense, step-by-step immigration reform. Really, the most important thing is that we never elect another president who imagines he or she has such unbridled power. And most critically, Republicans must show they can govern on immigration and a host of other issues both effectively and constitutionally.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020141123eabn003s6\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

That\u8217\'20\'19s not how our system works.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 President Obama, responding Friday to critics of his move to defer deportations for as many as 5 million undocumented immigrants \u8212\'20\'14 nearly half the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  population. Obama repeatedly urged \uc2 Congress\uc2 , if it didn't like his move, to "pass a bill."\par \par \uc2 46 The Kaiser poll showed that 46 percent of the public said they had a negative opinion of the health-care law, compared with 37 percent who said they held a positive opinion. Republicans continue to oppose the health-care law while Democrats embrace it. In short, even as news around the law develops and changes, opinions about it aren't budging much.\par \par \uc2 1 If \uc2 Hillary Rodham Clinton\uc2  runs for president, she may have at least one credible challenger for the Democratic nomination. Former senator James Webb (D-Va.) announced last week that he was forming a presidential exploratory committee. Clinton is still expected to be the overwhelming Democratic frontrunner if she runs. But Webb's decision is a reminder that there are elements of the party not fully behind a Clinton candidacy.\par \par \uc2 14Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-La.) can thank her own party for her Keystone XL pipeline embarrassment. Just 14 \uc2 Senate\uc2  Democrats voted for the measure. Meanwhile, all 45 \uc2 Senate\uc2  Republicans backed it.\par \par \uc2 Sen. \uc2 Mary Landrieu\uc2 's (D-La.) Keystone gambit backfired. Landrieu, faced with an almost unwinnable runoff Dec. 6, sought to prove her clout by getting the oil pipeline passed through \uc2 the Senate\uc2 . She came up one vote shy, looking even weaker in her matchup with Rep. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) than she did beforehand. Oh, and never mind the fact that Keystone will pass in the GOP-controlled \uc2 Senate\uc2  come January \u8212\'20\'14 and that President Obama simply would have vetoed it anyway. So, basically, it was a meaningless tactic that failed miserably.\par \par \uc2 Their Jonathan Gruber offensive got traction. Gruber's comments that Obamacare passed with an assist from "the stupidity of the American voter" continued to complicate life for Democrats, who basically disowned Gruber at the start of the week \u8212\'20\'14 just as the next Obamacare enrollment period was starting. The good news for Democrats is it doesn't appear to have affected the overall approval of the law.

DelReal   \par \uc2 609 \uc2 words\par \uc2 22 November 2014\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2014, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 On Thursday, a dozen men wearing thick jackets and scarred workboots took up their usual spots in a gas station parking lot in Arlington. All were illegal immigrants from Central America and Mexico. Most were middle-aged and had been living and working in the U.S. for years.\par \par \uc2 But although every man at the informal day-labor pickup site knew that President Obama was about to issue an unprecedented order to protect millions of illegal immigrants from deportation, they also knew they had no chance of qualifying for it.\par \par \uc2 "I'm happy for all those families who will be able to stay together now, but there are a lot of guys like me who came with the same dream. Now we're being left out," said Mario Juarez, 40, a painter from Guatemala who has spent the last 12 years working odd construction jobs and sending money back home to his wife and three children.\par \par \uc2 A few feet away, Jose Medina, 62, leaned against a chain-link fence and nursed a cold cup of coffee in a styrofoam cup. He said he had fled El Salvador in 1990 and obtained temporary protection as a war refugee, but lost it due to paperwork problems and never found a way to become permanently legal.\par \par \uc2 "It's hard being alone here," Medina said, mentioning that his sister in Maryland had become legal but that she had not been able to help him."If people are criminals they should be deported, but not if they do honest work," he added. "We are all out here on the corner because we don't have work permits. Now maybe we never will."\par \par \uc2 While tens of thousands of illegal immigrants in the greater Washington area eagerly awaited Obama's announcement Thursday, those who stood to personally benefit fell into two categories: parents of U.S.-born or resident children, and some adults who entered the U.S. as children themselves. For others \u8212\'20\'14 especially older workers who left their families behind \u8212\'20\'14 there was no hint of a coming reprieve.\par \par \uc2 According to several recent surveys of the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  population, about 3.7 million adults live with U.S. citizen or resident children, but another 6.5 million live with no children at all. Of those, several hundred thousand may qualify for protection as "childhood arrivals," a category Obama is expected to expand.\par \par \uc2 But several million, like Juarez and Medina, will fall outside the tent, either because they never sought to legalize or tried and failed. In informal interviews Thursday, several day laborers in Arlington and Hyattsville said they had not been able to parlay temporary refugee status into permanent residency. Others said they had children born in the U.S. but were divorced or estranged from the mother. A few of the laborers, especially those who had joined unions or other groups, said they had been closely following the news of Obama's pending order but did not yet know the details. Some were still holding out hope of being included.\par \par \uc2 "I am trying to have faith, but I'm still not sure whether I will qualify," said Antonio Chavez, 52, a Salvadoran construction worker who has been in the U.S. for 20 years but had lost his original refugee protection long ago due to legal complications. "I wish the president would help all 11 million of us, not just 5 million, but something is better than nothing," he added.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020141121eabl007pw\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.  \par \par \uc2 For 10 straight days and nights this month, Rosario Reyes did not eat. Each morning, she camped next to a monument in Lafayette Square, across from the White House. Each evening, she returned to a bunk bed at a nearby church. During the fast, she turned 36, received communion, watched tourists eat lunch, and tried to balance her water intake with her need to find a bathroom every few hours.\par \par \uc2 Reyes is a part-time babysitter and mother of three who has lived in suburban Maryland for a decade. She is also an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from El Salvador, and she had vowed to remain in the park without eating until President Obama signed an order offering temporary legal status to immigrants in her situation.\par \par \uc2 "My back is getting sore. My mouth tastes bitter," Reyes said Sunday, huddled near the monument with five other women who volunteered to fast in response to a call from an advocacy group called Dreamers' Moms USA. They knew a cold spell was coming soon but had arranged to bring extra clothes and blankets.\par \par \uc2 Since \uc2 Congress\uc2  failed to pass immigration reform last year, the president has promised repeatedly to take executive action to defer deportation for some of the estimated 11\u160\'00\'A0million adults who are in the country illegally, just as he did for half a million such youths in 2012.\par \par \uc2 Now, with Republicans poised to take control of both houses of \uc2 Congress\uc2 , Obama has again pledged to take action, triggering threats of retaliation by Republicans but raising hopes among illegal immigrants, including thousands in the Washington area, who see the president as their last chance for relief.\par \par \uc2 White House aides have said the order, which may come next week, would give priority to parents of U.S. citizens and "dreamer" youth, benefiting up to 5\u160\'00\'A0million people. Reyes would be an immediate candidate for such protection because her youngest son Victor, 6, is a U.S. citizen, born in Maryland, and her oldest son, Ricardo, 19, obtained temporary legalization as a dreamer last year. Her husband, Ramon, 40, a janitor, has semi-permanent legal status as a refu\u173\'00\'ADgee.\par \par \uc2 If the president does not act, Reyes will remain in limbo, subject to deportation and unable to legally work, drive or travel to El Salvador to visit her middle son. Jose Ramon, 13, lives with his grandmother and is reaching the age when criminal gangs will target him for forced recruitment.\par \par \uc2 "I worry about him all the time. When I get hungry out here, I think about him some more," Reyes said in Spanish.\par \par \uc2 The Reyes family is typical of hundreds of thousands in this country from Mexico and Central America whose members include illegal immigrants, U.S. citizens and others who live overseas. Advocates said that legalizing parents of legal children is a logical first step toward solving the broader immigration problems \uc2 Congress\uc2  has failed to tackle.\par \par \uc2 "If the president liberates 5 million immigrants to work and live here legally, it will be an extraordinary step in the right direction, but it is not enough," said \uc2 Gustavo Torres\uc2 , executive director of Casa de Maryland, a nonprofit immigrant advocacy group. "We still need to go to \uc2 Congress\uc2  and tell them it is time to resolve this crisis for all of our families and communities."\par \par \uc2 To many Americans, though, Reyes's status as a mother of two legalized children should not absolve her from having entered the country illegally. Some adamantly oppose granting "amnesty" to such lawbreakers and label U.S.-born children, such as Victor, "anchor babies" because they give undocumented parents a legal perch and extra incentive to stay. The surge of more than 50,000 minors arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border in recent months added to public concern about illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 "If the president enacts amnesty for up to four and a half million people with children who are citizens or permanent residents, it will not be immigration reform but the dismemberment of our immigration laws," said \uc2 Jessica Vaughan\uc2 , a researcher with the nonprofit \uc2 Center for Immigration Studies\uc2  in the District. "It would be a huge burden on taxpayers and create job competition for Americans and legal immigrants."\par \par \uc2 Instead of curbing illegal immigration, such a mass forgiveness could make it worse, Vaughan said. Referring to the border surge, she said, "if there is anything we have learned from recent experience, it is that even talk of amnesty inspires people to send for their family and friends because they get the message they'll be allowed to stay."\par \par \uc2 Reyes, fasting alongside five other Latina mothers from around the country, said she viewed the issue as one of family survival and her act as a form of personal, silent protest.\par \par \uc2 Sitting for hours under a blanket, she tried not to think about food and looked forward to periodic distractions \u8212\'20\'14 the church volunteers who brought guitars, the doctor who came to check vital signs, even the U.S. Park Police who kept poking around, making sure the women did not spread out sleeping bags and kept their mini-camp free of clutter.\par \par \uc2 At least once a day, Spanish-language TV crews show up to film. Often, tourists or passersby stop to ask about the protest, and a few have signed a poster with messages saying "Good luck" or "God bless you." But most keep walking.\par \par \uc2 Over several afternoons, Reyes recounted the 14-year journey that had brought her to Lafayette Square from the hot, agricultural province of Usulutan, where she and Ramon met and fell in love as teenagers. Ricardo was born in 1995, then Jose Ramon six years later. But their lives were shattered by violence when gangs threatened the family grocery business and shot Ramon's brother dead.\par \par \uc2 Fearing for his life, Ramon fled to the United States and made his way to relatives in Virginia, where he applied for "temporary protected status" available to those fleeing war, violence and natural disasters in Central America. That status was made renewable every year, meaning that Ramon and can live and work in the U.S. indefinitely.\par \par \uc2 Soon, Reyes said, he began urging her to come north and join him. In 2004, she made the hazardous journey across Mexico and the U.S. border, bringing Ricardo but leaving 3-year-old Jose Ramon behind. The decision seemed prudent at the time, but it kept gnawing at her.\par \par \uc2 The family built a modest life in the Maryland suburbs, with Ramon able to work steadily as a janitor after he obtained refu\u173\'00\'ADgee status. Rosario added income from part-time kitchen and babysitting jobs, but she had arrived too late to apply for the same legal protection. She lived cautiously, taking buses so as not to get caught driving illegally.\par \par \uc2 The couple often talked about trying to visit Jose Ramon or bringing him to the United States, but each time they decided it was too dangerous. Instead, as he grew older, they kept in touch by Skype.\par \par \uc2 "I help him with his homework, but I just want to have him with us as a family, especially at Christmas," Reyes said.\par \par \uc2 But it was the chance to help Ricardo become legal, after 17 years in the United States, that drew Reyes to the immigrant cause. Like many other Latino parents in Maryland, she said she started attending events to demand protection for "dreamers" like him. That June, Obama signed an executive order offering "deferred deportation" for qualified illegal youths, and Ricardo's application was approved.\par \par \uc2 Reyes, inspired by that experience, decided to participate in a "fast for families" on the Mall last November, organized by church, labor and immigrant groups to press the House to pass immigration reform. She dropped out after two days, but the hunger strike went on for three weeks, gaining nationwide attention.\par \par \uc2 This time, when local activists asked her to join a new fast asking Obama to take action on his own, she immediately said yes.\par \par \uc2 By Tuesday, after going without food for nine days, she had lost 14 pounds. Her back ached from sleeping in a wooden bunk at \uc2 National City Christian Church\uc2 . She said she was determined to keep going but worried about the coming cold and missed her family.\par \par \uc2 "When is Obama coming back from China?" Reyes asked, peering at the White House lit up in the dark across the stone plaza. "Do you think he'll be able to see us?"\par \par \uc2 By Friday, the fast had collapsed \u8212\'20\'14 a casualty of hunger, descending wintry weather and squabbles among the strikers. But in a way, Reyes felt they had succeeded anyway, because the news was full of talk about Obama taking action soon.\par \par \uc2 pamela.constable@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020141114eabe005ek\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 the-fix\par {\*\bkmkstart toc32}{\*\bkmkend toc32}\b \uc2 7 charts that explain the undocumented immigrant population\b0\par\par\uc2 By Nia-Malika Henderson   \par \uc2 795 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 November 2014\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2014, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 President Obama's executive order on immigration could exempt from deportation more than five million undocumented immigrants --\u160\'00\'A0almost half of the total undocumented population\u160\'00\'A0in the country, which is about 11.5 million (depending on the data you're looking at). The population is vast and diverse, coming from different countries and living in very different proportions in different states.\par \par \uc2 We took a look at some of the demographic breakdowns of the group pulled together by the Pew Hispanic Trends Project\u160\'00\'A0and the Department of Homeland Security.\par \par \uc2 Here is what we found:\par \par \uc2 1.\u160\'00\'A0Illegal immigrants make up 3.5 percent of the U.S. population\par \par \uc2 The vast majority\u160\'00\'A0of the population has roots in North America -- particularly Mexico and Central America. China, the Philippines, Korea and Vietnam are among the top 10\u160\'00\'A0countries of origin for the Asian \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  population, which has remained stable at 1.3 million -- about 11 percent of all undocumented immigrants.\par \par \uc2 2. Declining numbers from Mexico\par \par \uc2 The population of unauthorized immigrants over the last 4 years has largely flat-lined, remaining stable. Yet the Mexican undocumented\u160\'00\'A0population, which is 52 percent of the total, has consistently declined. Partly it's the difficult economy, which hasn't fully recovered, and a more secure border. And President Obama, nicknamed the "deporter-in-chief" by some, has been aggressive at sending people back to their country of origin -- more than two million to date.\par \par \uc2 3.\u160\'00\'A0 Unauthorized immigrants are settling in the South\par \par \uc2 President Obama began the public push for his executive order in Nevada, but while that state does have a high Latino population and the highest percentage of illegal immigrants\u160\'00\'A0in the country, it doesn't make the top 10\u160\'00\'A0of states as far as total undocumented population. (Roughly 210,000 undocumented immigrants live in Nevada.)\par \par \uc2 This list, which is mostly made of blue states, isn't exactly surprising. Georgia and North Carolina are part of a more widespread Latino population boom in the South. Relative to the overall population, Latinos -- undocumented and otherwise -- make up a small share. But their growth is rapid, doubling in some states\u160\'00\'A0in recent years.\par \par \uc2 4. \u160\'00\'A0Well over h alf of the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  population arrived after 1995\par \par \uc2 Obama's executive action will cover people who have citizen or legal permanent resident children who have been here for at least five years, meaning 2009 or before. His move will also expand the time frame use for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) measure to include any children who were brought to this country illegally before 2010.\par \par \uc2 5. The population is very\u160\'00\'A0young\par \par \uc2 Back in 2012, during a GOP presidential debate, \uc2 Newt Gingrich\uc2  and \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2  sparred over deporting "grandmothers and grandfathers," zeroing in a demographic that is actually a very small part of the \uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2  population. Some 80 percent are 44 years old and under, meaning they have a number of working and childbearing years in front of them. This means an expanded tax base for those that get work permits, but also means that in some instances people live "off the grid," while still utilizing school systems and hospitals.\par \par \uc2 6. Illegal immigrants make up a 5.1 percent of the workforce\par \par \uc2 Because of that youth, illegal immigrants are over-represented in the workforce -- 5.1 percent versus 3.5 percent of the overall population.\par \par \uc2 During his speech announcing his executive order, Obama made several references to illegal immigrants roles in the workforce. He talked about "workers who pick our fruit and make our beds" and "the determination of immigrant fathers who worked two or three jobs without taking a dime from the government." Dating back to 1995, as their population rose, illegal immigrants have steadily joined the workforce, peaking in 2011. The parents of lawful permanent residents and citizens who have been here for more than five years will be able to apply for work permits and temporary relief from deportation.\par \par \uc2 7. 7 percent of k-12 students have an undocumented parent\par \par \uc2 Another are where the undocumented are over-represented versus their share of the population is as parents. In fact, 7 percent of non-college students have at least one parent who is undocumented.\par \par \uc2 Obama talked a lot about students in his speech, acknowledging "the courage of students who, except for the circumstances of their birth, are as American as Malia or Sasha; students who bravely come out as undocumented in hopes they could make a difference in the country they love." And it's no accident that he will give his first speech outside of the beltway at a school in Nevada, where 17.7 percent of school children have a parent who is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020141121eabl008n5\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 President Obama's executive order on immigration could exempt from deportation more than five million undocumented immigrants --\u160\'00\'A0almost half of the total undocumented population\u160\'00\'A0in the country, which is about 11.5 million (depending on the data you're looking at). The population is vast and diverse, coming from different countries and living in very different proportions in different states.\par \par \uc2 We took a look at some of the demographic breakdowns of the group pulled together by the Pew Hispanic Trends Project\u160\'00\'A0and the Department of Homeland Security.\par \par \uc2 Here is what we found:\par \par \uc2 1.\u160\'00\'A0Illegal immigrants make up 3.5 percent of the U.S. population\par \par \uc2 The vast majority\u160\'00\'A0of the population has roots in North America -- particularly Mexico and Central America. China, the Philippines, Korea and Vietnam are among the top 10\u160\'00\'A0countries of origin for the Asian \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  population, which has remained stable at 1.3 million -- about 11 percent of all undocumented immigrants.\par \par \uc2 2. Declining numbers from Mexico\par \par \uc2 The population of unauthorized immigrants over the last 4 years has largely flat-lined, remaining stable. Yet the Mexican undocumented\u160\'00\'A0population, which is 52 percent of the total, has consistently declined. Partly it's the difficult economy, which hasn't fully recovered, and a more secure border. And President Obama, nicknamed the "deporter-in-chief" by some, has been aggressive at sending people back to their country of origin -- more than two million to date.\par \par \uc2 3.\u160\'00\'A0 Unauthorized immigrants are settling in the South\par \par \uc2 President Obama began the public push for his executive order in Nevada, but while that state does have a high Latino population and the highest percentage of illegal immigrants\u160\'00\'A0in the country, it doesn't make the top 10\u160\'00\'A0of states as far as total undocumented population. (Roughly 210,000 undocumented immigrants live in Nevada.)\par \par \uc2 This list, which is mostly made of blue states, isn't exactly surprising. Georgia and North Carolina are part of a more widespread Latino population boom in the South. Relative to the overall population, Latinos -- undocumented and otherwise -- make up a small share. But their growth is rapid, doubling in some states\u160\'00\'A0in recent years.\par \par \uc2 4. \u160\'00\'A0Well over h alf of the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  population arrived after 1995\par \par \uc2 Obama's executive action will cover people who have citizen or legal permanent resident children who have been here for at least five years, meaning 2009 or before. His move will also expand the time frame use for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) measure to include any children who were brought to this country illegally before 2010.\par \par \uc2 5. The population is very\u160\'00\'A0young\par \par \uc2 Back in 2012, during a GOP presidential debate, \uc2 Newt Gingrich\uc2  and \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2  sparred over deporting "grandmothers and grandfathers," zeroing in a demographic that is actually a very small part of the \uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2  population. Some 80 percent are 44 years old and under, meaning they have a number of working and childbearing years in front of them. This means an expanded tax base for those that get work permits, but also means that in some instances people live "off the grid," while still utilizing school systems and hospitals.\par \par \uc2 6. Illegal immigrants make up a 5.1 percent of the workforce\par \par \uc2 Because of that youth, illegal immigrants are over-represented in the workforce -- 5.1 percent versus 3.5 percent of the overall population.\par \par \uc2 During his speech announcing his executive order, Obama made several references to illegal immigrants roles in the workforce. He talked about "workers who pick our fruit and make our beds" and "the determination of immigrant fathers who worked two or three jobs without taking a dime from the government." Dating back to 1995, as their population rose, illegal immigrants have steadily joined the workforce, peaking in 2011. The parents of lawful permanent residents and citizens who have been here for more than five years will be able to apply for work permits and temporary relief from deportation.\par \par \uc2 7. 7 percent of k-12 students have an undocumented parent\par \par \uc2 Another are where the undocumented are over-represented versus their share of the population is as parents. In fact, 7 percent of non-college students have at least one parent who is undocumented.\par \par \uc2 Obama talked a lot about students in his speech, acknowledging "the courage of students who, except for the circumstances of their birth, are as American as Malia or Sasha; students who bravely come out as undocumented in hopes they could make a difference in the country they love." And it's no accident that he will give his first speech outside of the beltway at a school in Nevada, where 17.7 percent of school children have a parent who is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020141121eabl008eu\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

Fahrenthold   \par \uc2 2,150 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 November 2014\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2014, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 President Obama sought to convince the American public Thursday that his plans to unilaterally change immigration laws were well within the precedent set by previous administrations and did not amount to an amnesty program for illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 In a prime-time address from the White House, Obama argued that a mass deportation of the nation's more than 11 million undocumented immigrants "would be both impossible and contrary to our character."\par \par \uc2 Rather, the president said, the measures he is enacting to defer the deportations of 4 million immigrants while simultaneously refocusing federal border control agents on the highest-priority cases, such as felons, gang members and recent border-crossers, are aimed at "actual threats to our security."\par \par \uc2 "Felons, not families," Obama said of who would be in line for deportations. "Criminals, not children. Gang members, not a mom who's working hard to provide for her kids."\par \par \uc2 Under Obama's plan, the undocumented parents of U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents who have lived in the country for at least five years can apply, starting this spring, for relief from deportations for a period of three years. About 3.7 million immigrants are expected to qualify under the new guidelines.\par \par \uc2 The president also is expanding a 2012 program that has provided administrative relief to nearly 600,000 young people brought to the country illegally as children. Officials said that expansion, which will remove an age cap, could reach another 287,000 people.\par \par \uc2 The president's speech, which lasted 15 minutes, was an effort to build public support and head off staunch opposition from congressional Republicans who have vowed to fight Obama's use of executive actions to circumvent the legisative branch after an effort to pass a comprehensive immigration bill failed on Capitol Hill last summer.\par \par \uc2 Even before Obama took to the airwaves, GOP leaders were deliberating over their next move over how to stop him. Republicans in both chambers debated filing a lawsuit over the president's use of executive authority, pursuing their own legislation on immigration policy or removing funding for federal immigration agencies.\par \par \uc2 "We are considering a variety of options," Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who will become majority leader next month, said Thursday in a floor speech. He suggested that his preference would be for Republicans to avoid becoming mired in a fiscal clash during the lame-duck session, shortly before the GOP takes control of \uc2 the Senate\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 But White House lawyers expressed confidence that Obama has the legal standing to enact the changes. They cited previous executive actions taken by Republican presidents, including Ronald Reagan and \uc2 George H.W. Bush\uc2 , both of whom signed orders protecting smaller groups of illegal immigrants from deportation.\par \par \uc2 In his remarks, Obama quoted another Republican \u8212\'20\'14 his predecessor, \uc2 George W. Bush\uc2 -- while making the case that illegal immigrants "are a part of American life."\par \par \uc2 Asked about a potential GOP lawsuit, a senior administration official said: "Anyone with a filing fee can sue, there's nothing we can do about that." But the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe the president's thinking, added that administration lawyers believe Obama's actions "are absolutely supported by the law."\par \par \uc2 Obama portrayed his approach as a "commonsense, middle-ground approach" that will allow otherwise law-abiding immigrants to "come out of the shadows and get right with the law."\par \par \uc2 Addressing the chief criticism of Republicans \u8212\'20\'14 that illegal immigrants are being rewarded for violating the law to remain in the country \u8212\'20\'14 Obama declared that his policy is not amnesty.\par \par \uc2 "Amnesty is the immigration system we have today \u8211\'20\'13 millions of people who live here without paying their taxes or playing by the rules, while politicians use the issue to scare people and whip up votes at election time," Obama said. "That's the real amnesty \u8211\'20\'13 leaving this broken system the way it is."\par \par \uc2 The plan to offer immigrants who qualify for Obama's executive action plan three years of relief would mean that the newly processed applicants would be protected from deportations through the first year of Obama's successor in 2017. That would leave it up to the new administration to determine whether to continue the program or abruptly eliminate it.\par \par \uc2 The new protections are a year longer than under the 2012 program for younger immigrants, known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, and officials said that the DACA program also would be revised to provide three years of relief. It also would change the date by which applicants must have arrived in the United States from June 15, 2007, to Jan. 1, 2010, officials said.\par \par \uc2 Administration officials said the president's decision to protect \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  parents of U.S. citizens and permanent residents from deportation is based a "humanitarian" rationale that recognizes special legal statutes \uc2 Congress\uc2  has enacted to keep together families, administration officials said Thursday.\par \par \uc2 Under current law, immigrant children living legally in the United States are permitted to apply for visas for their parents, and Obama's decision to defer the deportations of up to 4 million undocumented immigrants is consistent with that precedent, the officials said.\par \par \uc2 "The impact of the contrary position would be that mothers and fathers and their children could be separated," said one senior administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in a briefing for reporters ahead of Obama's prime-time address. "\uc2 Congress\uc2  has recognized this is a particular relationship that \uc2 Congress\uc2  is willing to protect."\par \par \uc2 Obama alluded to the skilled worker piece of his plan at the White House on Thursday morning, during a ceremony to honor top American scientists.\par \par \uc2 "Part of staying competitive in a global economy is making sure that we have an immigration system that doesn't send away top talent, but attracts it," Obama said to applause, according to a transcript of the event.\par \par \uc2 If Obama follows through, his plan would be the most significant alteration in the U.S. immigration system since the 1980s.\par \par \uc2 Obama believes he can make the changes based on his own executive authority: White House officials said they spent months making sure that the president would do only what the law allows. Obama is acting after \uc2 Congress\uc2  \u8212\'20\'14 divided between a Republican-controlled House and a Democratic majority in \uc2 the Senate\uc2  \u8212\'20\'14 was unable to agree on an immigration overhaul.\par \par \uc2 But, even before Obama's changes were announced, Republicans in \uc2 Congress\uc2  denounced them as reaching far beyond his constitutional powers.\par \par \uc2 A spokesman for House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio), for instance, referred to the president as "Emperor Obama" and charged that he was exceeding his constitutional authority and cementing "his legacy of lawlessness."\par \par \uc2 "This is presidential overreach of monumental proportions," said Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), who is likely to be the next chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. "It's a direct erosion of congressional power. .\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09. I think \uc2 Congress\uc2  needs to and will resist and do so in a way that is responsible."\par \par \uc2 But now, Republican leaders in \uc2 Congress\uc2  face a tricky question.\par \par \uc2 What, exactly, should they do about it?\par \par \uc2 The party's leaders have advocated tactics that \u8212\'20\'14 they say \u8212\'20\'14 would provide a forceful response, without shutting down the government itself. They might file a lawsuit, challenging Obama's authority in court. They might craft legislation to make their own revisions to immigration policy.\par \par \uc2 But many in the Republican rank-and-file believe those tactics would not be forceful enough.\par \par \uc2 Instead, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) said on Wednesday that Obama's executive action should be met with a refusal to vote on any more of his nominees. On Thursday, looking for a parallel to Obama's actions, Cruz reached back to ancient Rome, comparing Obama to the Catiline conspiracy, a plot to overthrow the Roman Republic.\par \par \uc2 Sessions has advocated a series of short-term spending bills. The idea would be to create a series of deadlines: if \uc2 Congress\uc2  did not pass a new spending bill, the government might shut down. Sessions believes that these deadlines might give Republicans leverage to demand concessions from Obama on immigration.\par \par \uc2 But the risk for Republicans is that, if Obama does not cave the way Sessions expects, the government might actually shut down, and Republicans might get some of the blame.\par \par \uc2 Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) has hinted at another possibility: bringing up articles of impeachment against Obama.\par \par \uc2 More moderate Republicans worry that these actions could alienate Latino voters and repeat the self-inflicted wounds of the 2013 government shutdown.\par \par \uc2 "The president wants to see an angry and intemperate response, thinking the Republicans will do something that leads to a shutdown," said Rep. Charlie Dent (R-Pa.). "Don't take the bait, and don't have a hysterical reaction. We can be strong, rational and measured."\par \par \uc2 On Wednesday, Obama discussed his plans with more than a dozen congressional Democrats during a dinner at the White House, outlining why he believes his actions are "the first big step" in reforming the nation's immigration system. But Obama also emphasized that his actions are not going to be a permanent solution.\par \par \uc2 Rep. Judy Chu (D-Calif.), who chairs the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus and attended Wednesday night's dinner, said the president "was very clear on the fact that we have to do this now and remain strong through this process."\par \par \uc2 The showdown with Republicans comes two years after Obama, flush off his 2012 reelection, announced he would pursue a legislative overhaul of immigration laws as he sought to fulfill a campaign promise to Latino and Asian American supporters who were frustrated that the president had not done more on immigration in his first term.\par \par \uc2 But an 18-month effort to pass legislation, which included a path to citizenship, collapsed this summer in the face of strenuous opposition in the Republican-controlled House. In June, Obama promised to act aggressively on the problem in areas where the law allowed the use of his executive authority.\par \par \uc2 Administration lawyers have spent months reviewing case law and meeting with immigration advocates, law enforcement officials and legal experts to develop options for Obama, who reviewed them with Department of Homeland Security Secretary \uc2 Jeh Johnson\uc2  and Attorney General \uc2 Eric H. Holder Jr\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 In addition to his plan to protect some immigrant parents from deportation, Obama is also expected to expand a 2012 program that has deferred the deportations of nearly 600,000 younger immigrants known as "Dreamers," who were brought into the country illegally as children. (The name comes from the Dream Act, proposed legislation that \uc2 Congress\uc2  has failed to pass.) Obama's plans would expand that program by raising the maximum current age from 30 and raising the maximum arrival age above 16. However, it is not known how many years of eligibility he will add at either end or how many more people will be covered.\par \par \uc2 "I am getting slammed with calls from people asking me if they will qualify, but I can't tell them anything yet," said Simon Sandoval Moshenberg of the Legal Aid Justice Center in Falls Church, Va., which has helped scores of young immigrants apply for the deferred-action program over the past two years. "Any time you draw a line, there are people who fall on either side. It was heartbreaking to see people miss the age cutoff date by just a few weeks, and that can happen again."\par \par \uc2 The White House, recognizing the political risks, moved to shore up public support with an aggressive sales job. Obama released a video on \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , explaining his reasons for taking action. By Thursday afternoon, the video had been watched more than 3.3\u160\'00\'A0million times.\par \par \uc2 His prime-time address Thursday also is aimed at including "as many people across the country in this broader debate" as possible, White House press secretary Josh Earnest said. However, most of the major television networks announced they will not carry the remarks live, leaving it to the cable news channels and the Spanish-language network Univision, where Obama's remarks will come right before the airing of the Latin Grammy Awards.\par \par \uc2 On Friday, Obama will return to Las Vegas's Del Sol High School, which holds a special significance for him. On Jan. 11, 2008, then-Sen. Obama arrived in that city after losing to then-Sen. \uc2 Hillary Rodham Clinton\uc2  in New Hampshire's presidential primary. Obama pivoted to the heavily Latino voting bloc of Nevadans and delivered what became known as his "Si Se Puede" speech \u8212\'20\'14 the Spanish equivalent of "Yes We Can."\par \par \uc2 At the high school that day, hundreds filled the gymnasium, and hundreds more waited outside as the president vowed to deliver on citizenship for undocumented immigrants.\par \par \uc2 david.nakamura@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 robert .costa@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 david.fahrenthold@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020141120eabk0079k\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 As a writer at The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2 , when I write about people who have immigrated to America without using the proper channels, I am allowed to call them "illegal immigrants," although, as the style guide notes, "some find [the term] offensive." It is preferred that I say that someone is in the country illegally; it is not allowed to call that person "an illegal."\par \par \uc2 The Post delineates guidelines on this for consistency, largely, but also, I'd say, to reflect the broader mores of the public we serve. How such immigrants are referred to varies by media outlet, as Fusion's Felix Salmon outlines in a graphic at that site. Media companies clearly spend much more time thinking about this than the public at large -- but perhaps less time than elected officials.\par \par \uc2 How Democrats in particular refer to immigrants has changed over time. When the term "undocumented immigrants" came in popular usage, it was a replacement for "\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 " precisely because of the pejorative nature of "illegal" and the unfortunate habit of truncating "\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 " to "illegal." Over the past 18 years, the switch in usage by the party is obvious. (We used the \uc2 Sunlight Foundation\uc2 's excellent Capitol Words tool for the next two graphs.)\par \par \uc2 One of the earliest uses of "undocumented" was in 1996, by then-Rep. Bernie Sanders (D-Vt.), now, of course, a senator from that state. "There is a section of the bill," Sanders said that March, "that says that immigrants who are here illegally, or undocumented immigrants, are unable to receive health care through our public system." Since 1996, the term has been much more popular with Democrats than Republicans; members of the former party use it three times as often.\par \par \uc2 But Democrats use all three terms far less frequently than do Republicans, for whom immigration in general is a much more energizing subject. (That's why the graph above has a vertical axis that extends to 150 mentions per month: to allow for easy comparison with the other party.) Republicans are far more likely to use not only "illegal immigrants," but also "illegals" -- a term that has at times been used just as commonly.\par \par \uc2 There was a brief blip of the usage of "undocumented immigrants," but the expression has remained out of favor on the right.\par \par \uc2 It's hard to evaluate how Americans refer to the immigrant group simply because tracking language use in/by the public is a bit trickier. One way to get a sense for the terms people use is by seeing what they search for on \uc2 Google\uc2 . The graph below shows interest in each expression as a search term over time. And in that sense, congressional Republicans seem to be echoing the language more commonly used by voters. (This is an imperfect metric, we will readily admit.)\par \par \uc2 But again, most Americans don't spend a lot of time worrying about how they refer to people. The evolution of language in this regard is slow and marked by bursts of activity. (Think of the shift from "Negro" to "black," for example.) Democrats, responsible to a constituency, are headed in a different direction than Republicans, hoping that the voters will choose to join them on that path. Yes, I'm still referring to the language being used, but not entirely.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020141121eabl006n0\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

Hern\u225\'00\'E1ndez   \par \uc2 1,144 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 November 2014\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2014, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Maria Martinez clutched her 8-year-old son Rene's hand and fingered her rosary beads, listening intently Thursday night as President Obama announced his plan to shield several million illegal immigrants from deportation.\par \par \uc2 All around her, people inthe basement room at the CASA de Maryland headquarters in Hyattsville, Md., were clapping and cheering. But Martinez, 33, a housekeeper from El Salvador, was quietly absorbing the magnitude of what had just happened and how it would change her life.\par \par \uc2 "The fear is over," Martinez said tearfully. "All I can think about is what I'm going to tell the kids."\par \par \uc2 For nine years, Martinez has not seen her two older children, whom she left behind in El Salvador to join her husband in the United States.\par \par \uc2 Now, the president had just announced that parents of children like Rene, who was born in this country, could apply for a reprieve from deportation. Martinez might finally be able to travel home and return legally to the United States.\par \par \uc2 Across the Washington region and the nation, illegal immigrants celebrated as the president announced that 3.7\u160\'00\'A0million parents of U.S.-born and resident children as well as 1 million or more undocumented immigrants who arrived as children would have a path to receive work permits, drive and conduct legal transactions.\par \par \uc2 There were also scenes ofdeep disappointment, especially among groups of Latina women known as "dreamer moms," whose children were among about 600,000 legalized by Obama in a 2012 program but were not included in his new action as grounds for legalizing parents.\par \par \uc2 "It's a small bandage for a large wound," said Maria Reyes, 68, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Mexico who lives near Oakland, Calif. She was waiting outside the White House on Thursday evening after fasting there for several days. Although her two children were granted deportation relief through the 2012 "Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals" program, they will not be able to confer legal status on her.\par \par \uc2 There were also several million illegal immigrants who never stood a chance of reprieve under Obama's plan, especially adult men who left their families behind and came to work in the United States illegally. Some Central Americans obtained temporary protection as war refu\u173\'00\'ADgees, but many could not convert that to permanent legal status, while Mexicans \u8212\'20\'14 the great majority of undocumented immigrants \u8212\'20\'14 had no such benefit.\par \par \uc2 Mario Juarez, 40, a painter from Honduras, spent Thursday in a parking lot in Arlington, Va., hoping a contractor would come along in a van to offer him a day's wages. Around him were a dozen other men in thick jackets and scuffed workboots, many of whom had been working in the United States for years and yet knew they had no hope of deportation relief.\par \par \uc2 "I'm happy for all those families who will be able to stay together now, but there are a lot of guys like me who came with the same dream. Now we're being left out," said Juarez, who has spent the past 12 years working odd construction jobs and sending money back home to his wife and three children.\par \par \uc2 Nonetheless, the mood in many Latino communities Thursday night was one of enormous relief. People who gathered in \u173\'00\'ADchurches, nonprofit agencies and social halls to watch the speech cheered, hugged one another and chanted, "Viva Obama" or "S\u237\'00\'ED, se pudo," meaning "Yes, he could."\par \par \uc2 In Chicago, Doris Aguirre sat in the front row of Lincoln \uc2 United Methodist Church\uc2  with her daughter Izaithell, 13, at her feet as they looked up at Obama on the big screen. The president's words meant that because of Izaithell, a U.S. citizen born in Chicago, her mother has a chance to remain in the country legally after nearly 15 years as an undocumented immigrant.\par \par \uc2 "I am still trying to process all this, but I am optimistic," Aguirre said when Obama finished speaking. "I think everything is going to get better for us. I hope I qualify, because I think I deserve it."\par \par \uc2 Aguirre came from Honduras in 2000, traveling for 10 days while still breast-feeding her 5-month-old son, Bladimir, now 15 and also an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . She said U.S. Border Patrol agents picked her up in Texas but gave her a bus ticket to Chicago, where she had relatives.\par \par \uc2 There she met Roberto Aguirre, 68, a Mexican immigrant who had become a U.S. citizen in the 1980s. When they went to apply for a marriage license, they discovered that there was a deportation order outstanding for Aguirre and Bladimir. They have been living in the shadows ever since.\par \par \uc2 "It's been so hard. We lost our house, and we lost everything because I have never been able to work and we don't have enough money," she said. "But now it's like everything has changed. It's like all my dreams have come true. We came here to make a life, and now maybe I can."\par \par \uc2 Aguirre said she hoped that she could now apply for a driver's license, get a job and not be afraid of being deported every time she leaves the house. She said people who think Obama is rewarding lawbreakers don't understand the misery she faced in Honduras. She says she is only guilty of trying to help her family.\par \par \uc2 "God bless that law that I broke, because it got me here," she said. "I will never regret breaking that law."\par \par \uc2 In Las Vegas, people gathered at the Hermandad \uc2 Mexicana\uc2  Nacional community center to watch the speech. Lorena Palos was there \u8212\'20\'14 even though she had originally planned to be at the Latin Grammys, walking the red carpet and hobnobbing with celebrities. She had picked out a pink gown to wear, but put it back in her closet when she heard that Obama would speak Thursday evening.\par \par \uc2 Palos, 18, was born in Mexico and was granted deferred action two years ago. Her brother is a U.S. citizen, and her parents are undocumented.\par \par \uc2 "I knew I didn't want to miss this," she said. "We've been fighting for this for so long. It's not right to say that I'll find out about this later for something so big."\par \par \uc2 She texted her parents during the speech.\par \par \uc2 "It's a weight lifted off our shoulders," she said. "I don't think there could be a more historic moment. This is a moment that will live forever in the immigrant community."\par \par \uc2 pamela.constable@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 arelis.hernandez@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 Kevin Sullivan\uc2  in Chicago and Katie Zezima in Las Vegas contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020141121eabl00106\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 right-turn\par {\*\bkmkstart toc37}{\*\bkmkend toc37}\b \uc2 Obama's immigration edict has no legal justification ; The president's unconvincing claim of legitimacy.\b0\par\par\uc2 By Jennifer Rubin   \par \uc2 880 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 November 2014\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2014, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The broadcast networks refused to air the president's immigration speech, with some insiders admitting the networks found\u160\'00\'A0 it too political. Besides that, the speech was insulting to anyone remotely familiar with our system of government, and it assumes that his base is so unhinged it will stop at nothing to get what it wants. Obama seems to have learned (or didn't) in the midterms that the country is not the same as his base.\par \par \uc2 By the time the speech rolled around,\u160\'00\'A0 we already knew the main provisions of his executive order and even the empty phrases\par \par \uc2 to justify going around the law-making branch of government. He will grant a reprieve from deportation for three years for an estimated 4 million people, either \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  parents of children who are legal residents or citizens residing here for at least five years and those brought here by 2010 illegally as children. How anyone goes about definitively establishing exactly when people entered illegally will \u160\'00\'A0be one of many issues to be worked out.\par \par \uc2 He proclaimed, "And to those members of \uc2 Congress\uc2  who question my authority to make our immigration system work better, or question the wisdom of me acting where \uc2 Congress\uc2  has failed, I have one answer: Pass a bill."\par \par \uc2 But who needs \uc2 Congress\uc2  when the president declares what is reasonable and comes up with his own bill? ("What I'm describing is accountability\u8212\'20\'14a common-sense, middle-ground approach: If you meet the criteria, you can come out of the shadows and get right with the law. If you're a criminal, you'll be deported.") Of\u160\'00\'A0course, as president you don't get to make up rules that change existing law simply because another branch won't do what you want. That negates the essence of separation of powers and checks and balances. A president can't take over the \uc2 Congress\uc2 's delegated powers if others don't cooperate any more than \uc2 Congress\uc2  can take over law enforcement or the courts can issue pardons (the president has that power).\par \par \uc2 And there was the false choice: Round up and deport everyone or he acts alone. It was this type of reasoning that suggests he thinks Americans are, to quote some adviser he had, "stupid."\par \par \uc2 His assertion that other presidents have done the same is patently false, something the former constitutional law instructor should know. \u160\'00\'A0No, in other cases the presidents acted to interpret existing law as \uc2 Congress\uc2  authorized them to do. And the huge number of the persons affected by Obama's actions in and of itself sets a new and disturbing precedent. \u160\'00\'A0In short, prior presidents were not operating in direct contravention of law that \uc2 Congress\uc2  refused to change.\par \par \uc2 Beyond the lame excuses for acting on his own, the plan risks another surge at the border. The reason for doing border security first is to cut off others who would flock seeking the same relief. And the purpose of a slow and demanding path to legalization is both to disincentivize other illegal immigrants and preserve the integrity of a system that determines (or used to determine) who gets into the country and who doesn't. (He laughably described the border crises earlier this year as "a brief spike" in unaccompanied minors trying to enter. \u160\'00\'A0One wonders how many spikes are ahead.)\par \par \uc2 From start to finish the speech was full of condescending admonitions for \uc2 Congress\uc2  to rise above politics and not shut down the government over this one issue. It is probably a blessing for him that the networks did not carry the speech. They would have melted the White House phone lines.\par \par \uc2 Speaker of the House \uc2 John Boehner\uc2  put out a succinct message before the president's remarks: "Instead of working together to fix our broken immigration system, the president says he's acting on his own.\u160\'00\'A0 That's just not how our democracy works.\u160\'00\'A0\u160\'00\'A0 The president has said before that 'he's not king' and he's 'not an emperor,' but he's sure acting like one.\u160\'00\'A0 And he's doing it a time when the American people want nothing more than for us to work together." That seems to sum it up.\par \par \uc2 And Rep. H. Morgan Griffith (R-Va.) made a sound point in his released statement, one of the more impressive of a slew of GOP missives. "I question the authority to make a blanket decision regarding the prosecution of criminal laws, as opposed to making decisions in a specific individual's case.\u160\'00\'A0 Further, prosecutorial discretion does not give authority to grant unprosecuted violators with privileges or benefits such as work permits.\u160\'00\'A0 Such benefits granted to unprosecuted violators may be in violation of the law." It is one thing not to deport it is another thing to award green cards in contravention of federal law.\par \par \uc2 As with the Taliban prisoner swap the White House may not have spotted the backlash about to wash over them. \u160\'00\'A0The issue will no doubt come in to play in 2016. Speaking of which, what does \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  think? It will be interesting to see if she agrees a president can do whatever he wants if \uc2 Congress\uc2  does not agree.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020141121eabl000xd\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

The least: Florida.\b0\par\par\uc2 By Aaron Blake   \par \uc2 330 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 November 2014\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2014, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 President Obama announced a big executive action on immigration Thursday night. But while it allows nearly half of\u160\'00\'A0illegal immigrants\u160\'00\'A0in the United States to avoid deportation, the impact varies significantly\u160\'00\'A0by state.\par \par \uc2 According to\u160\'00\'A0data from the \uc2 Migration Policy Institute\uc2 , 51 percent of illegal immigrants in Texas and 50 percent in California -- the two states with the largest\u160\'00\'A0\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  populations -- will be temporarily exempted from deportation. But in\u160\'00\'A0Maryland and Massachusetts, it's just 35 percent, and in Virginia it's 37 percent.\par \par \uc2 Aside from California and Texas, at least half of illegal immigrants in Arizona, Colorado, Illinois, Oregon and Utah will be exempted.\par \par \uc2 Here's how that looks, focusing on states with large \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  populations (states in gray have very small \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  populations and are not included):\par \par \uc2 One thing that stood out to us: Republicans will accuse Democrats of doing this to shore up the Latino vote going forward. But swing states\u160\'00\'A0aren't really the biggest beneficiaries, with Virginia mentioned above at 37 percent, Florida at 40 percent, North Carolina at 44 percent and Nevada at 46 percent.\par \par \uc2 Obama's executive action varies by state because it is focused on illegal immigrants who are parents of children who are citizens or legal permanent residents and have been here for at least five years, which is about 3.7 million of the estimated 11.4 million illegal immigrants in the United States. Another 1.5 million will benefit from the program called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), which Obama first announced in 2012 and allows young illegal immigrants who came to the United States as children to stay. That program was expanded by about 300,000 after Thursday's announcement\par \par \uc2 The other 6.2 million illegal immigrants are not covered by Obama's executive action.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020141121eabl004h5\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved   \par \par \uc2 Maria Martinez clutched her 8-year-old son Rene's hand and fingered her rosary beads, listening intently Thursday night as President Obama announced his plan to shield several million illegal immigrants from deportation.\par \par \uc2 All around her, people inthe basement room at the CASA de Maryland headquarters in Hyattsville, Md., were clapping and cheering. But Martinez, 33, a housekeeper from El Salvador, was quietly absorbing the magnitude of what had just happened and how it would change her life.\par \par \uc2 "The fear is over," Martinez said tearfully. "All I can think about is what I'm going to tell the kids."\par \par \uc2 For nine years, Martinez has not seen her two older children, whom she left behind in El Salvador to join her husband in the United States.\par \par \uc2 Now, the president had just announced that parents of children like Rene, who was born in this country, could apply for a reprieve from deportation. Martinez might finally be able to travel home and return legally to the United States.\par \par \uc2 Across the Washington region and the nation, illegal immigrants celebrated as the president announced that 3.7 million parents of U.S.-born and resident children as well as 1 million or more undocumented immigrants who arrived as children would have a path to receive work permits, drive and conduct legal transactions.\par \par \uc2 There were also scenes ofdeep disappointment, especially among groups of Latina women known as "dreamer moms," whose children were among about 600,000 legalized by Obama in a 2012 program but were not included in his new action as grounds for legalizing parents.\par \par \uc2 "It's a small bandage for a large wound," said Maria Reyes, 68, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Mexico who lives near Oakland, Calif. She was waiting outside the White House on Thursday evening after fasting there for several days. Although her two children were granted deportation relief through the 2012 "Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals" program, they will not be able to confer legal status on her.\par \par \uc2 There were also several million illegal immigrants who never stood a chance of reprieve under Obama's plan, especially adult men who left their families behind and came to work in the United States illegally. Some Central Americans obtained temporary protection as war refugees, but many could not convert that to permanent legal status, while Mexicans - the great majority of undocumented immigrants - had no such benefit.\par \par \uc2 Mario Juarez, 40, a painter from Honduras, spent Thursday in a parking lot in Arlington, Va., hoping a contractor would come along in a van to offer him a day's wages. Around him were a dozen other men in thick jackets and scuffed workboots, many of whom had been working in the United States for years and yet knew they had no hope of deportation relief.\par \par \uc2 "I'm happy for all those families who will be able to stay together now, but there are a lot of guys like me who came with the same dream. Now we're being left out," said Juarez, who has spent the past 12 years working odd construction jobs and sending money back home to his wife and three children.\par \par \uc2 Nonetheless, the mood in many Latino communities Thursday night was one of enormous relief. People who gathered in churches, nonprofit agencies and social halls to watch the speech cheered, hugged one another and chanted, "Viva Obama" or "S\u224\'00\'E0\u173\'00\'AD, se pudo," meaning "Yes, he could."\par \par \uc2 In Chicago, Doris Aguirre sat in the front row of Lincoln \uc2 United Methodist Church\uc2  with her daughter Izaithell, 13, at her feet as they looked up at Obama on the big screen. The president's words meant that because of Izaithell, a U.S. citizen born in Chicago, her mother has a chance to remain in the country legally after nearly 15 years as an undocumented immigrant.\par \par \uc2 "I am still trying to process all this, but I am optimistic," Aguirre said when Obama finished speaking. "I think everything is going to get better for us. I hope I qualify, because I think I deserve it."\par \par \uc2 Aguirre came from Honduras in 2000, traveling for 10 days while still breast-feeding her 5-month-old son, Bladimir, now 15 and also an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . She said U.S. Border Patrol agents picked her up in Texas but gave her a bus ticket to Chicago, where she had relatives.\par \par \uc2 There she met Roberto Aguirre, 68, a Mexican immigrant who had become a U.S. citizen in the 1980s. When they went to apply for a marriage license, they discovered that there was a deportation order outstanding for Aguirre and Bladimir. They have been living in the shadows ever since.\par \par \uc2 "It's been so hard. We lost our house, and we lost everything because I have never been able to work and we don't have enough money," she said. "But now it's like everything has changed. It's like all my dreams have come true. We came here to make a life, and now maybe I can."\par \par \uc2 Aguirre said she hoped that she could now apply for a driver's license, get a job and not be afraid of being deported every time she leaves the house. She said people who think Obama is rewarding lawbreakers don't understand the misery she faced in Honduras. She says she is only guilty of trying to help her family.\par \par \uc2 "God bless that law that I broke, because it got me here," she said. "I will never regret breaking that law."\par \par \uc2 In Las Vegas, people gathered at the Hermandad \uc2 Mexicana\uc2  Nacional community center to watch the speech. Lorena Palos was there - even though she had originally planned to be at the Latin Grammys, walking the red carpet and hobnobbing with celebrities. She had picked out a pink gown to wear, but put it back in her closet when she heard that Obama would speak Thursday evening.\par \par \uc2 Palos, 18, was born in Mexico and was granted deferred action two years ago. Her brother is a U.S. citizen, and her parents are undocumented.\par \par \uc2 "I knew I didn't want to miss this," she said. "We've been fighting for this for so long. It's not right to say that I'll find out about this later for something so big."\par \par \uc2 She texted her parents during the speech.\par \par \uc2 "It's a weight lifted off our shoulders," she said. "I don't think there could be a more historic moment. This is a moment that will live forever in the immigrant community."\par \par \uc2 Kevin Sullivan\uc2  in Chicago and Katie Zezima in Las Vegas contributed to this report. \par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com\par \par \uc2 WP20141121immigrants\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020141121eabl0004p\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved   \par \par \uc2 CHICAGO - Francisca Bueno, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Mexico, sat in a pew at Lincoln \uc2 United Methodist Church\uc2  in Southwest Chicago, watching President Obama live on a big screen in a church filled with other families that all had at least one member who was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Her eyes filled with tears as Obama, his words translated simultaneously into Spanish, spoke of immigration reforms that she had thought would never come.\par \par \uc2 "This is like a dream," she said, bundled up in a \uc2 Chicago Bears\uc2  jacket and a knit cap. "It was all worth it. All the marches we went to, all the fear and pain. It was all worth it."\par \par \uc2 Bueno, 35, came to the United States from Mexico with relatives when she was 10 years old. She crossed the border illegally into the southern desert, not even knowing what state she was in, and ended up in Chicago, where her four brothers were living.\par \par \uc2 She had lost the fingers on her right hand at age 7 while grinding corn in her home town of Puebla. Her hope was that doctors in the United States could somehow repair her hand.\par \par \uc2 More than 20 years later, she is married and has four U.S.-born children, ages 18, 15, 11 and 9.\par \par \uc2 She works at home making pi\u241\'00\'F1atas and knitting small items to sell. Her husband, also an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Mexico, works as a janitor.\par \par \uc2 "I hope now I will be able to get a job to help my husband," she said. "He says it is dangerous enough for him to leave the house to go to work, and he didn't know what he would do if I was deported."\par \par \uc2 Bueno said that Obama understood "that most of us who came here when we were young didn't know we were breaking any law. We just wanted to have a better life."\par \par \uc2 After Obama spoke, the crowd erupted into chants of "Viva Obama" and "Si Se Pudo" - Yes, he could.\par \par \uc2 Emma Lozano, a minister at the church, asked those who believed they were eligible for relief under Obama's plan to raise their hands.\par \par \uc2 Among the 60 or 70 people in the room, only a few hands went up - including Bueno's. But she said she wasn't sure, because Obama's plans still seemed confusing to her. She thought she would be eligible because of her U.S.-citizen children and because she had been in the country for so long, but she couldn't be sure.\par \par \uc2 "I feel freedom and peace," Bueno said, tears rolling down her cheeks. "But I am still so afraid."\par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com\par \par \uc2 WP20141121v-chicago\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020141121eabl0000p\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 President Obama will unveil an executive action on Thursday night\u160\'00\'A0offering millions of undocumented immigrants temporary legal status. The reported\u160\'00\'A0plan is expected to offer temporary protection from deportation to undocumented parents of U.S. citizens or permanent residents who have been in the country for at least five years. It may also expand the 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which allowed those younger than 30 who arrived in the United States as children to apply for deportation deferral.\par \par \uc2 Who is the plan likely to affect? The \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  population is notably hard to research, but the \uc2 Pew Research Center\uc2 's Hispanic Trends Project\u160\'00\'A0has compiled some data on who these immigrants are and where they are located.\par \par \uc2 Pew research\u160\'00\'A0indicates that there were 11.3 million unauthorized immigrants in the country in 2013, or about 3.5 percent of the country's population and 5 percent of its labor force. They are heavily concentrated in the most populous states, including California, Texas, Florida and New Jersey. The distribution of that population is changing, however, with more people flowing west to east between 2009 and 2012.\par \par \uc2 The same\u160\'00\'A0research estimates that 7 percent of K-12 students had at least one unauthorized immigrant parent in 2012. Among those students, about eight in 10 were born in the United States.\par \par \uc2 The United States deported about 369,000 illegal immigrants in 2013, according to the Department of Homeland Security\u160\'00\'A0\u8212\'20\'14 a little more than 3 percent of the undocumented population in the country. While that's a small portion of the total \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  population, a recent poll by the \uc2 Pew Research Center\uc2  suggests that the effects of such deportations have been far-reaching.\par \par \uc2 According to a poll conducted in September and October by the \uc2 Pew Research Center\uc2 , roughly a quarter of all Latinos say they personally know someone who has been deported or detained for immigration reasons in the past 12 months. Latinos ages 18 to 29 were twice as likely to say they knew someone who had been deported or detained, compared with Latinos 50 and older.\par \par \uc2 The same poll found that six in 10 respondents disapproved of the way the Obama administration was handling deportations, with only one in four approving. Those who knew someone who was deported or detained were more likely to disapprove of the administration's deportation policy.\par \par \uc2 This post comes via Know More, Wonkblog's social media site for the best and most interesting visuals, videos, and data hits from around the Web.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 President Obama will announce his intention Thursday to use his executive powers to shield millions of illegal immigrants from deportation, the most significant presidential intervention to alter the U.S. immigration system in nearly three decades.\par \par \uc2 Using a rare prime-time address from the White House, Obama hopes to build public support for his decision to remake border-control laws without approval from \uc2 Congress\uc2 , a move likely to spark a major political fight about the limits of presidential power. Obama will provide more details at a rally with immigration advocates in Las Vegas on Friday as the White House begins a campaign to mobilize grass-roots support for the effort.\par \par \uc2 Obama is expected to announce measures that would make as many as 4\u160\'00\'A0million immigrants eligible for temporary protected status, according to people briefed on the plans. He also will take steps to expand visas for high-tech workers, modify federal immigrant detention procedures, and add resources to strengthen border security, they said.\par \par \uc2 "Everybody agrees that our immigration system is broken," Obama said in a brief video released on his \uc2 Facebook\uc2  page Wednesday. "Unfortunately, Washington has allowed the problem to fester for too long."\par \par \uc2 But even as he moved to address an old problem, Obama created a new political tempest on Capitol Hill, where Republicans quickly denounced his actions less than two weeks after voters handed the GOP full control \uc2 Congress\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 A spokesman for House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) referred to the president as "Emperor Obama" and charged that he was exceeding his constitutional authority and cementing "his legacy of lawlessness." Several GOP members suggested using a government spending bill next month to counter Obama's move by defunding related immigration programs, setting up the potential for a government shutdown.\par \par \uc2 "This is presidential overreach of monumental proportions," said Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), the incoming chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. "It's a direct erosion of congressional power. .\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09. I think \uc2 Congress\uc2  needs to and will resist and do so in a way that is responsible."\par \par \uc2 Obama discussed his plans with more than a dozen congressional Democrats during a dinner at the White House, outlining why he believes his actions are "the first big step" in reforming the nation's immigration system. But Obama also emphasized that his actions are not going to be a permanent solution. Rep. Judy Chu (D-Calif.), who chairs the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus and attended Wednesday night's dinner, said the president "was very clear on the fact that we have to do this now and remain strong through this process."\par \par \uc2 The showdown with Republicans comes two years after Obama, flush off his 2012 reelection, announced he would pursue a legislative overhaul of immigration laws as he sought to fulfill a campaign promise to Latino and Asian American supporters who were frustrated that the president had not done more on immigration in his first term.\par \par \uc2 But an 18-month effort to pass legislation, which included a path to citizenship, collapsed this summer in the face of strenuous opposition in the Republican-controlled House. In June, Obama promised to act aggressively on the problem in areas where the law allowed the use of his executive authority.\par \par \uc2 Administration lawyers have spent months reviewing case law and meeting with immigration advocates, law enforcement officials and legal experts to develop options for Obama, who reviewed them with Department of Homeland Security Secretary \uc2 Jeh Johnson\uc2  and Attorney General \uc2 Eric H. Holder Jr\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Under his plan, Obama will provide administrative relief to \uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2  parents of children who are U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents, an adult population that reaches an estimated 3.71\u160\'00\'A0million, according to a report from the \uc2 Migration Policy Institute\uc2 . However, the president's order also will require the parents to have lived in the United States for a certain number of years \u8212\'20\'14 probably five. The average \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  has lived in the country for 13 years.\par \par \uc2 Many of those who receive administrative relief also will be eligible to apply for work permits.\par \par \uc2 The president also is expected to expand a 2012 program that has deferred the deportations of nearly 600,000 younger immigrants known as "dreamers" who were brought into the country illegally as children. Obama's plans would expand that program by raising the maximum current age from 30 and raising the maximum arrival age above 16. However, it is not known how many years of eligibility he will add at either end or how many more people will be covered.\par \par \uc2 "I am getting slammed with calls from people asking me if they will qualify, but I can't tell them anything yet," said Simon Sandoval Moshenberg of the Legal Aid Justice Center in Falls Church, Va., which has helped scores of young immigrants apply for the deferred-action program over the past two years. "Any time you draw a line, there are people who fall on either side. It was heartbreaking to see people miss the age cutoff date by just a few weeks, and that can happen again."\par \par \uc2 Obama will stop short of extending protections to hundreds of thousands of parents of the dreamers, after the White House Office of Legal Counsel determined that doing so would exceed the president's legal authorities to act unilaterally, according to the people briefed on the plans.\par \par \uc2 About 671,000 parents live with \uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2  children, and 6.5\u160\'00\'A0million live with no children at all \u8212\'20\'14 meaning that most of them are unlikely to be eligible for deportation relief, although some might qualify under other potential changes, including if they serve in the U.S. military.\par \par \uc2 The administration also is adding a program to facilitate visas for people who invest in the United States and those who pursue science, technology, engineering and math degrees. But the administration determined that it lacked the legal authority to expand visas for migrant farm workers or the existing H-1B visa program for highly skilled foreigners, lawmakers said.\par \par \uc2 "Even if they help 5\u160\'00\'A0million people, a lot of others will be left out, but it is still a huge step forward and an historic decision. It is one of the biggest victories we've ever had," said \uc2 Frank Sharry\uc2 , executive director of America's Voice, a national immigrant advocacy group based in Washington.\par \par \uc2 Despite its limits, Sharry said Obama's executive action "could well be a turning point from a decade of ramping up enforcement to a more balanced approach, where protection of immigrants is combined with enforcement against bad actors."\par \par \uc2 White House officials declined to provide details about the president's announcement, but Johnson called the president's plan "comprehensive." He and other administration officials emphasized that Obama remains supportive of \uc2 Congress\uc2 's undertaking a broader legislative fix to immigration laws next year.\par \par \uc2 "Legislative action is always preferable," Johnson said during an appearance at the \uc2 National Press Club\uc2  on Wednesday. "But we have waited for \uc2 Congress\uc2  to act, and the \uc2 Congress\uc2  has not acted. It can't be that we're not allowed to lift a finger to fix our broken immigration system. And we will."\par \par \uc2 For Republicans, the confrontation represents the first test of GOP leaders' ability to calibrate their political strategy after the party's successes in the midterm elections. While some members appear eager for a fight with the White House, others cautioned that the party should tread carefully, underscoring the mounting concerns among Republican officials over the simmering outrage of conservative lawmakers and its political consequences, particularly with the Hispanic community.\par \par \uc2 Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), the soon-to-be majority leader, expressed confidence Wednesday that congressional Republicans will extend the federal government's funding, which is set to expire next month.\par \par \uc2 In an effort to cast doubt on the legality of Obama's decision, GOP aides circulated a list of 22 times the president has said publicly that he doesn't believe he has the authority to act through executive action to change immigration laws.\par \par \uc2 The White House, recognizing the political risks, moved to shore up public support with an aggressive sales job. By Wednesday afternoon, Obama's \uc2 Facebook\uc2  video had been watched more than 1.7\u160\'00\'A0million times.\par \par \uc2 His prime-time address Thursday also is aimed to include "as many people across country in this broader debate," White House press secretary Josh Earnest said. However, most of the major television networks announced they will not carry the remarks live, leaving it to the cable news channels and the Spanish-language network Univision, where Obama's remarks will come right before the airing of the Latin Grammy Awards.\par \par \uc2 On Friday, Obama will return to Las Vegas's Del Sol High School, which holds a special significance for him. On Jan. 11, 2008, then-Sen. Obama arrived in that city after losing to then-Sen. \uc2 Hillary Rodham Clinton\uc2  in New Hampshire's presidential primary. Obama pivoted to the heavily Latino voting bloc of Nevadans and delivered what became known as his "Si Se Puede" speech \u8212\'20\'14 the Spanish equivalent of "Yes We Can."\par \par \uc2 At the high school that day, hundreds filled the gymnasium and hundreds more waited outside as the president vowed to deliver on citizenship for undocumented immigrants.\par \par \uc2 david.nakamura@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 pamela.constable@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 Ed O'Keefe, \uc2 Juliet Eilperin\uc2 , Paul Kane, Katie Zezima and \uc2 Robert Costa\uc2  contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020141120eabk00105\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved   \par \par \uc2 President Obama will announce his intention Thursday to use his executive powers to shield millions of illegal immigrants from deportation, the most significant presidential intervention to alter the U.S. immigration system in nearly three decades.\par \par \uc2 Using a rare prime-time address from the White House, Obama hopes to build public support for his decision to remake border-control laws without approval from \uc2 Congress\uc2 , a move likely to spark a major political fight about the limits of presidential power. Obama will provide more details at a rally with immigration advocates in Las Vegas on Friday as the White House begins a campaign to mobilize grass-roots support for the effort.\par \par \uc2 Obama is expected to announce measures that would make as many as 4 million immigrants eligible for temporary protected status, according to people briefed on the plans. He also will take steps to expand visas for high-tech workers, modify federal immigrant detention procedures, and add resources to strengthen border security, they said.\par \par \uc2 "Everybody agrees that our immigration system is broken," Obama said in a brief video released on his \uc2 Facebook\uc2  page Wednesday. "Unfortunately, Washington has allowed the problem to fester for too long."\par \par \uc2 But even as he moved to address an old problem, Obama created a new political tempest on Capitol Hill, where Republicans quickly denounced his actions less than two weeks after voters handed the GOP full control \uc2 Congress\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 A spokesman for House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) referred to the president as "Emperor Obama" and charged that he was exceeding his constitutional authority and cementing "his legacy of lawlessness." Several GOP members suggested using a government spending bill next month to counter Obama's move by defunding related immigration programs, setting up the potential for a government shutdown.\par \par \uc2 "This is presidential overreach of monumental proportions," said Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), the incoming chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. "It's a direct erosion of congressional power. . . . I think \uc2 Congress\uc2  needs to and will resist and do so in a way that is responsible."\par \par \uc2 Obama discussed his plans with more than a dozen congressional Democrats during a dinner at the White House, outlining why he believes his actions are "the first big step" in reforming the nation's immigration system. But Obama also emphasized that his actions are not going to be a permanent solution. Rep. Judy Chu (D-Calif.), who chairs the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus and attended Wednesday night's dinner, said the president "was very clear on the fact that we have to do this now and remain strong through this process."\par \par \uc2 The showdown with Republicans comes two years after Obama, flush off his 2012 reelection, announced he would pursue a legislative overhaul of immigration laws as he sought to fulfill a campaign promise to Latino and Asian American supporters who were frustrated that the president had not done more on immigration in his first term.\par \par \uc2 But an 18-month effort to pass legislation, which included a path to citizenship, collapsed this summer in the face of strenuous opposition in the Republican-controlled House. In June, Obama promised to act aggressively on the problem in areas where the law allowed the use of his executive authority.\par \par \uc2 Administration lawyers have spent months reviewing case law and meeting with immigration advocates, law enforcement officials and legal experts to develop options for Obama, who reviewed them with Department of Homeland Security Secretary \uc2 Jeh Johnson\uc2  and Attorney General \uc2 Eric H. Holder Jr\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Under his plan, Obama will provide administrative relief to \uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2  parents of children who are U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents, an adult population that reaches an estimated 3.71 million, according to a report from the \uc2 Migration Policy Institute\uc2 . However, the president's order also will require the parents to have lived in the United States for a certain number of years - probably five. The average \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  has lived in the country for 13 years.\par \par \uc2 Many of those who receive administrative relief also will be eligible to apply for work permits.\par \par \uc2 The president also is expected to expand a 2012 program that has deferred the deportations of nearly 600,000 younger immigrants known as "dreamers" who were brought into the country illegally as children. Obama's plans would expand that program by raising the maximum current age from 30 and raising the maximum arrival age above 16. However, it is not known how many years of eligibility he will add at either end or how many more people will be covered.\par \par \uc2 "I am getting slammed with calls from people asking me if they will qualify, but I can't tell them anything yet," said Simon Sandoval Moshenberg of the Legal Aid Justice Center in Falls Church, Va., which has helped scores of young immigrants apply for the deferred-action program over the past two years. "Any time you draw a line, there are people who fall on either side. It was heartbreaking to see people miss the age cutoff date by just a few weeks, and that can happen again."\par \par \uc2 Obama will stop short of extending protections to hundreds of thousands of parents of the dreamers, after the White House Office of Legal Counsel determined that doing so would exceed the president's legal authorities to act unilaterally, according to the people briefed on the plans.\par \par \uc2 About 671,000 parents live with \uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2  children, and 6.5 million live with no children at all - meaning that most of them are unlikely to be eligible for deportation relief, although some might qualify under other potential changes, including if they serve in the U.S. military.\par \par \uc2 The administration also is adding a program to facilitate visas for people who invest in the United States and those who pursue science, technology, engineering and math degrees. But the administration determined that it lacked the legal authority to expand visas for migrant farm workers or the existing H-1B visa program for highly skilled foreigners, lawmakers said.\par \par \uc2 "Even if they help 5 million people, a lot of others will be left out, but it is still a huge step forward and an historic decision. It is one of the biggest victories we've ever had," said \uc2 Frank Sharry\uc2 , executive director of America's Voice, a national immigrant advocacy group based in Washington.\par \par \uc2 Despite its limits, Sharry said Obama's executive action "could well be a turning point from a decade of ramping up enforcement to a more balanced approach, where protection of immigrants is combined with enforcement against bad actors."\par \par \uc2 White House officials declined to provide details about the president's announcement, but Johnson called the president's plan "comprehensive." He and other administration officials emphasized that Obama remains supportive of \uc2 Congress\uc2 's undertaking a broader legislative fix to immigration laws next year.\par \par \uc2 "Legislative action is always preferable," Johnson said during an appearance at the \uc2 National Press Club\uc2  on Wednesday. "But we have waited for \uc2 Congress\uc2  to act, and the \uc2 Congress\uc2  has not acted. It can't be that we're not allowed to lift a finger to fix our broken immigration system. And we will."\par \par \uc2 For Republicans, the confrontation represents the first test of GOP leaders' ability to calibrate their political strategy after the party's successes in the midterm elections. While some members appear eager for a fight with the White House, others cautioned that the party should tread carefully, underscoring the mounting concerns among Republican officials over the simmering outrage of conservative lawmakers and its political consequences, particularly with the Hispanic community.\par \par \uc2 Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), the soon-to-be majority leader, expressed confidence Wednesday that congressional Republicans will extend the federal government's funding, which is set to expire next month.\par \par \uc2 In an effort to cast doubt on the legality of Obama's decision, GOP aides circulated a list of 22 times the president has said publicly that he doesn't believe he has the authority to act through executive action to change immigration laws.\par \par \uc2 The White House, recognizing the political risks, moved to shore up public support with an aggressive sales job. By Wednesday afternoon, Obama's \uc2 Facebook\uc2  video had been watched more than 1.7 million times.\par \par \uc2 His prime-time address Thursday also is aimed to include "as many people across country in this broader debate," White House press secretary Josh Earnest said. However, most of the major television networks announced they will not carry the remarks live, leaving it to the cable news channels and the Spanish-language network Univision, where Obama's remarks will come right before the airing of the Latin Grammy Awards.\par \par \uc2 On Friday, Obama will return to Las Vegas's Del Sol High School, which holds a special significance for him. On Jan. 11, 2008, then-Sen. Obama arrived in that city after losing to then-Sen. \uc2 Hillary Rodham Clinton\uc2  in New Hampshire's presidential primary. Obama pivoted to the heavily Latino voting bloc of Nevadans and delivered what became known as his "Si Se Puede" speech - the Spanish equivalent of "Yes We Can."\par \par \uc2 At the high school that day, hundreds filled the gymnasium and hundreds more waited outside as the president vowed to deliver on citizenship for undocumented immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Ed O'Keefe, \uc2 Juliet Eilperin\uc2 , Paul Kane, Katie Zezima and \uc2 Robert Costa\uc2  contributed to this report. \par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com\par \par \uc2 WP20141120immigration1120\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020141120eabk00028\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 the-fix\par {\*\bkmkstart toc44}{\*\bkmkend toc44}\b \uc2 Illegal immigrants are 3.5 percent of the population. But they are parents to 7 percent of K-12 students. \b0\par\par\uc2 By Aaron Blake   \par \uc2 330 \uc2 words\par \uc2 19 November 2014\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2014, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Even as President Obama prepares to announce his immigration executive action, the percentage of illegal immigrants in the United States has dropped. While the undocumented comprised an estimated 4 percent of the population in 2009, that number was down to 3.5 percent in 2012, according to data from Pew. The raw number was down from an estimated 12.2 million in 2009 to 11.2 million in 2012.\par \par \uc2 The reasons are mostly twofold: (1)\u160\'00\'A0the economic depression, which made immigrating illegally less attractive, and (2) the unprecedented deportations that have taken place during\u160\'00\'A0the Obama Administration -- more than 2 million, as of earlier this year.\par \par \uc2 But lest anyone think Obama's executive action won't potentially affect lots and lots of people, I bring you this:\par \par \uc2 The below map, from Pew, shows the percentage of K-12 students in each state who have at least one undocumented parent.\par \par \uc2 At the high end is Nevada. While 7.6 percent of Nevada residents are illegal immigrants, more than one in six K-12 students (17.7 percent) has at least one undocumented immigrant for a parent.\par \par \uc2 That number is 13.2 percent in California, 13.1 percent in Texas and 11 percent in Arizona. In each case, the number of children with undocumented parents is more than twice the overall undocumented population.\par \par \uc2 Another 20 states have more than 5 percent of students with an undocumented parent. Overall, 6.9 percent of American students -- about one in 14 -- have at least one \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  for a parent.

All Rights Reserved   \par \par \uc2 Maryland and Virginia, with a combined total population of 525,000 illegal immigrants, could be substantially affected if President Obama offers deportation relief to some groups of undocumented immigrants, according to a report issued by the \uc2 Pew Research Center\uc2  on Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 But the extent to which undocumented immigrants in the region will benefit depends on the details of the order.\par \par \uc2 If the president decides as expected to focus on helping illegal parents of children who are U.S-born, school statistics suggest that the Washington region will have a lower percentage of eligible applicants than the national average, Pew said.\par \par \uc2 Nationwide, at least 4 million such parents could benefit from such a policy, and states with large numbers of illegal immigrants - led by California, with 2.45 million, and followed by Florida, New York and New Jersey, each with over half a million - would be the most heavily affected by a presidential order.\par \par \uc2 The Pew report, issued in anticipation that the president will take such action imminently, says that Maryland and Virginia have experienced among the largest increases in number of illegal immigrants nationwide since 2009, with both populations rising by 15 percent during that time.\par \par \uc2 Nationwide, however, the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  population is declining or remaining stable, officials at Pew and a second research institute said Tuesday, noting that the undocumented population has decreased in 14 states and risen in only seven since 2007, which was the peak year.\par \par \uc2 According to a profile of the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  population to be published Wednesday by the \uc2 Migration Policy Institute\uc2 , 3.4 million unauthorized immigrants have lived in the United States from five to nine years, and an additional 5.4 million from 10 to 20 years.\par \par \uc2 "We are seeing an unauthorized population that is deeply settled here," said \uc2 Marc Rosenblum\uc2 , deputy director of U.S. immigration policy at the policy institute. "They have real roots in communities over a big chunk of time."\par \par \uc2 Obama's expected order would reportedly be aimed at undocumented immigrants who have multiple ties to the United States, in terms of work, family and years of residence.\par \par \uc2 Jeffrey Passel\uc2 , one of the authors of the Pew report, said state-by-state data showed that concern over illegal immigration has not always been proportional to the size of the local undocumented population. Alabama, for example, has passed strict laws aimed at driving out illegal immigrants, yet only 1.2 percent of its populace is undocumented - one of the lowest levels in the country.\par \par \uc2 "Nationwide, the numbers are going down, and we are not seeing increases," Passel said, adding that the main cause was a steady decline in the number of Mexicans seeking to enter the United States, now at a 40-year low. The Obama administration has also carried out a massive campaign to deport illegal immigrants who break other U.S. laws, in part to bolster support for legalizing those who have clean records.\par \par \uc2 According to Pew, while nine states have more illegal immigrants than Maryland and Virginia, only six have higher percentages of them. In Maryland, the percentage is now 4.3 percent of all residents; in Virginia, it is 3.5 percent. The report was based on statistics from 2012.\par \par \uc2 Maryland now has 250,000 unauthorized immigrants and Virginia has 275,000, the report estimates. In the District, there has been no growth in illegal immigrants, who number about 20,000 and comprise 3.1 percent of the population, Pew said.\par \par \uc2 In the Washington area, the largest \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  group by far is from El Salvador, followed by other Central Americans and Mexicans; in most of the country, Mexicans are the largest such group.\par \par \uc2 Nationwide, the Pew report says that about 4 million of an estimated 11.2 million illegal immigrants live with U.S.-born children, a factor that is expected to be the major criterion for granting deportation relief.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Migration Policy Institute\uc2  put the number of potentially eligible parents at the slightly lower figure of 3.46 million, but it said that could increase to 5 million if Obama decides to count recently legalized children as grounds for deportation relief. About 700,000 illegal youths have applied so far, according to Rosenblum.\par \par \uc2 The president has not yet decided whether to do so, but he is said to be considering making more \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  youths eligible for deportation relief by liberalizing the terms of his 2012 order, such as raising the maximum current age from 30 and lowering the minimum arrival age from 16.\par \par \uc2 Passel, the senior demographer at Pew, said that the number of U.S.-born children with illegal parents is "just not that big." He said that with an average of 6.9 percent of children having an illegal parent, about 1 of every 15 schoolchildren would fall into that category.\par \par \uc2 Despite the large populace of illegal immigrants in the Washington area, however, only a small percentage of school children in either state have an illegal parent. In Maryland, only 5.7 percent of children in kindergarten through 12th grade have an illegal parent; the number is 5.5 percent in Virginia and 4.9 percent in the District. By contrast, Nevada has 18 percent and California and Texas each have 13 percent.\par \par \uc2 Officials at Pew said the report did not include unauthorized minors from the U.S.-Mexico border who were sent to live with parents or other relatives this year. Federal government agencies have said about 3,000 of a total of 37,000 such minors have been relocated to the Washington area.\par \par \uc2 In terms of the labor force, Pew reported that about 200,000 unauthorized immigrants in Maryland and about 200,000 in Virginia were working or seeking work. In Maryland this constituted 6.1 percent of the labor force and in Virginia 5.1 percent, which is also the national average.\par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com\par \par \uc2 WP20141119immigreport\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020141119eabj0002c\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Maryland and Virginia, with a combined total population of 525,000 illegal immigrants, could be substantially affected if President Obama offers deportation relief to some groups of undocumented immigrants, according to a report issued by the \uc2 Pew Research Center\uc2  on Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 But the extent to which undocumented immigrants in the region will benefit depends on the details of the order.\par \par \uc2 If the president decides as expected to focus on helping illegal parents of children who are U.S-born, school statistics suggest that the Washington region will have a lower percentage of eligible applicants than the national average, Pew said.\par \par \uc2 Nationwide, at least 4\u160\'00\'A0million such parents could benefit from such a policy, and states with large numbers of illegal immigrants \u8212\'20\'14 led by California, with 2.45\u160\'00\'A0million, and followed by Florida, New York and New Jersey, each with over half a million \u8212\'20\'14 would be the most heavily affected by a presidential \u173\'00\'ADorder.\par \par \uc2 The Pew report, issued in anticipation that the president will take such action imminently, says that Maryland and Virginia have experienced among the largest increases in number of illegal immigrants nationwide since 2009, with both populations rising by 15\u160\'00\'A0percent during that time.\par \par \uc2 Nationwide, however, the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  population is declining or remaining stable, officials at Pew and a second research institute said Tuesday, noting that the undocumented population has decreased in 14\u160\'00\'A0states and risen in only seven since 2007, which was the peak year.\par \par \uc2 According to a profile of the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  population to be published Wednesday by the \uc2 Migration Policy Institute\uc2 , 3.4\u160\'00\'A0million unauthorized immigrants have lived in the United States from five to nine years, and an additional\u160\'00\'A05.4 million from 10 to 20 years.\par \par \uc2 "We are seeing an unauthorized population that is deeply settled here," said \uc2 Marc Rosenblum\uc2 , deputy director of U.S. immigration policy at the policy institute. "They have real roots in communities over a big chunk of time."\par \par \uc2 Obama's expected order would reportedly be aimed at undocumented immigrants who have multiple ties to the United States, in terms of work, family and years of residence.\par \par \uc2 Jeffrey Passel\uc2 , one of the authors of the Pew report, said state-by-state data showed that concern over illegal immigration has not always been proportional to the size of the local undocumented population. Alabama, for example, has passed strict laws aimed at driving out illegal immigrants, yet only 1.2\u160\'00\'A0percent of its populace is undocumented \u8212\'20\'14 one of the lowest levels in the country.\par \par \uc2 "Nationwide, the numbers are going down, and we are not seeing increases," Passel said, adding that the main cause was a steady decline in the number of Mexicans seeking to enter the United States, now at a 40-year low. The Obama administration has also carried out a massive campaign to deport illegal immigrants who break other U.S. laws, in part to bolster support for legalizing those who have clean records.\par \par \uc2 According to Pew, while nine states have more illegal immigrants than Maryland and \u173\'00\'ADVirginia, only six have higher percentages of them. In Maryland, the percentage is now 4.3\u160\'00\'A0percent of all residents; in Virginia, it is 3.5\u160\'00\'A0percent. The report was based on statistics from 2012.\par \par \uc2 Maryland now has 250,000 unauthorized immigrants and Virginia has 275,000, the report estimates. In the District, there has been no growth in illegal immigrants, who number about 20,000 and comprise 3.1\u160\'00\'A0percent of the population, Pew said.\par \par \uc2 In the Washington area, the largest \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  group by far is from El Salvador, followed by other Central Americans and Mexicans; in most of the country, Mexicans are the largest such group.\par \par \uc2 Nationwide, the Pew report says that about 4\u160\'00\'A0million of an estimated 11.2\u160\'00\'A0million illegal immigrants live with U.S.-born children, a factor that is expected to be the major criterion for granting deportation relief.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Migration Policy Institute\uc2  put the number of potentially eligible parents at the slightly lower figure of 3.46\u160\'00\'A0million, but it said that could increase to 5\u160\'00\'A0million if Obama decides to count recently legalized children as grounds for deportation relief. About 700,000\u160\'00\'A0illegal youths have applied so far, according to Rosenblum.\par \par \uc2 The president has not yet decided whether to do so, but he is said to be considering making more \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  youths eligible for deportation relief by liberalizing the terms of his 2012 order, such as raising the maximum current age from 30 and lowering the minimum arrival age from 16.\par \par \uc2 Passel, the senior demographer at Pew, said that the number of U.S.-born children with illegal parents is "just not that big." He said that with an average of 6.9\u160\'00\'A0percent of children having an illegal parent, about 1\u160\'00\'A0of every 15\u160\'00\'A0schoolchildren would fall into that category.\par \par \uc2 Despite the large populace of illegal immigrants in the Washington area, however, only a small percentage of school children in either state have an illegal parent. In Maryland, only 5.7\u160\'00\'A0percent of children in kindergarten through 12th\u160\'00\'A0grade have an illegal parent; the number is 5.5\u160\'00\'A0percent in Virginia and 4.9\u160\'00\'A0percent in the District. By contrast, Nevada has 18\u160\'00\'A0percent and California and Texas each have 13\u160\'00\'A0percent.\par \par \uc2 Officials at Pew said the report did not include unauthorized minors from the U.S.-Mexico border who were sent to live with parents or other relatives this year. Federal government agencies have said about 3,000 of a total of 37,000 such minors have been relocated to the Washington area.\par \par \uc2 In terms of the labor force, Pew reported that about 200,000 unauthorized immigrants in Maryland and about 200,000 in Virginia were working or seeking work. In Maryland this constituted 6.1\u160\'00\'A0percent of the labor force and in Virginia 5.1\u160\'00\'A0percent, which is also the national average.\par \par \uc2 pamela.constable@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020141118eabi005hb\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved   \par \par \uc2 Since Nov. 3, Rosario Reyes has not eaten. She has spent every day sitting at the base of a stone monument in Lafayette Park across from the White House, and every night sleeping in a bunk bed at a nearby church. During the fast she has turned 36, taken Communion, been serenaded by guitarists, watched tourists eat lunch, and tried to balance her water intake with her need to find a public bathroom every few hours.\par \par \uc2 Reyes is a mother of three who has lived in suburban Maryland for the last decade. She is also an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from El Salvador, and she has vowed to remain in the park without eating until President Obama signs an order offering temporary legal status to immigrants in her situation.\par \par \uc2 "My back is getting sore. My mouth tastes bitter," Reyes said Sunday, huddled around the monument with five other women who volunteered to fast in response to a call from an advocacy group called Dreamers' Moms USA.\par \par \uc2 Since last year, when Congress failed to pass immigration reform, the president has promised repeatedly to take executive action to defer deportation for some of the estimated 11 million adults who are in the country illegally, just as he did for half a million illegal youths in 2012.\par \par \uc2 White House aides have said the order, possibly coming as soon as this coming week, would give priority to parents of U.S. citizens and "dreamer" youth, benefitting up to 5 million people.\par \par \uc2 - Pamela Constable\par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com\par \par \uc2 WP20141116key-BDstoryA-bd-1116\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020141116eabg0006m\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved   \par \par \uc2 For 10 straight days and nights this month, Rosario Reyes did not eat. Each morning, she camped next to a monument in Lafayette Square, across from the White House. Each evening, she returned to a bunk bed at a nearby church. During the fast, she turned 36, received communion, watched tourists eat lunch, and tried to balance her water intake with her need to find a bathroom every few hours.\par \par \uc2 Reyes is a part-time babysitter and mother of three who has lived in suburban Maryland for a decade. She is also an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from El Salvador, and she had vowed to remain in the park without eating until President Obama signed an order offering temporary legal status to immigrants in her situation.\par \par \uc2 "My back is getting sore. My mouth tastes bitter," Reyes said Sunday, huddled near the monument with five other women who volunteered to fast in response to a call from an advocacy group called Dreamers' Moms USA. They knew a cold spell was coming soon but had arranged to bring extra clothes and blankets.\par \par \uc2 Since \uc2 Congress\uc2  failed to pass immigration reform last year, the president has promised repeatedly to take executive action to defer deportation for some of the estimated 11 million adults who are in the country illegally, just as he did for half a million such youths in 2012.\par \par \uc2 Now, with Republicans poised to take control of both houses of \uc2 Congress\uc2 , Obama has again pledged to take action, triggering threats of retaliation by Republicans but raising hopes among illegal immigrants, including thousands in the Washington area, who see the president as their last chance for relief.\par \par \uc2 White House aides have said the order, which may come next week, would give priority to parents of U.S. citizens and "dreamer" youth, benefiting up to 5 million people. Reyes would be an immediate candidate for such protection because her youngest son Victor, 6, is a U.S. citizen, born in Maryland, and her oldest son, Ricardo, 19, obtained temporary legalization as a dreamer last year. Her husband, Ramon, 40, a janitor, has semi-permanent legal status as a refugee.\par \par \uc2 If the president does not act, Reyes will remain in limbo, subject to deportation and unable to legally work, drive or travel to El Salvador to visit her middle son. Jose Ramon, 13, lives with his grandmother and is reaching the age when criminal gangs will target him for forced recruitment.\par \par \uc2 "I worry about him all the time. When I get hungry out here, I think about him some more," Reyes said in Spanish.\par \par \uc2 The Reyes family is typical of hundreds of thousands in this country from Mexico and Central America whose members include illegal immigrants, U.S. citizens and others who live overseas. Advocates said that legalizing parents of legal children is a logical first step toward solving the broader immigration problems \uc2 Congress\uc2  has failed to tackle.\par \par \uc2 "If the president liberates 5 million immigrants to work and live here legally, it will be an extraordinary step in the right direction, but it is not enough," said \uc2 Gustavo Torres\uc2 , executive director of Casa de Maryland, a nonprofit immigrant advocacy group. "We still need to go to \uc2 Congress\uc2  and tell them it is time to resolve this crisis for all of our families and communities."\par \par \uc2 To many Americans, though, Reyes's status as a mother of two legalized children should not absolve her from having entered the country illegally. Some adamantly oppose granting "amnesty" to such lawbreakers and label U.S.-born children, such as Victor, "anchor babies" because they give undocumented parents a legal perch and extra incentive to stay. The surge of more than 50,000 minors arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border in recent months added to public concern about illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 "If the president enacts amnesty for up to four and a half million people with children who are citizens or permanent residents, it will not be immigration reform but the dismemberment of our immigration laws," said \uc2 Jessica Vaughan\uc2 , a researcher with the nonprofit \uc2 Center for Immigration Studies\uc2  in the District. "It would be a huge burden on taxpayers and create job competition for Americans and legal immigrants."\par \par \uc2 Instead of curbing illegal immigration, such a mass forgiveness could make it worse, Vaughan said. Referring to the border surge, she said, "if there is anything we have learned from recent experience, it is that even talk of amnesty inspires people to send for their family and friends because they get the message they'll be allowed to stay."\par \par \uc2 Reyes, fasting alongside five other Latina mothers from around the country, said she viewed the issue as one of family survival and her act as a form of personal, silent protest.\par \par \uc2 Sitting for hours under a blanket, she tried not to think about food and looked forward to periodic distractions - the church volunteers who brought guitars, the doctor who came to check vital signs, even the U.S. Park Police who kept poking around, making sure the women did not spread out sleeping bags and kept their mini-camp free of clutter.\par \par \uc2 At least once a day, Spanish-language TV crews show up to film. Often, tourists or passersby stop to ask about the protest, and a few have signed a poster with messages saying "Good luck" or "God bless you." But most keep walking.\par \par \uc2 Over several afternoons, Reyes recounted the 14-year journey that had brought her to Lafayette Square from the hot, agricultural province of Usulutan, where she and Ramon met and fell in love as teenagers. Ricardo was born in 1995, then Jose Ramon six years later. But their lives were shattered by violence when gangs threatened the family grocery business and shot Ramon's brother dead.\par \par \uc2 Fearing for his life, Ramon fled to the United States and made his way to relatives in Virginia, where he applied for "temporary protected status" available to those fleeing war, violence and natural disasters in Central America. That status was made renewable every year, meaning that Ramon and can live and work in the U.S. indefinitely.\par \par \uc2 Soon, Reyes said, he began urging her to come north and join him. In 2004, she made the hazardous journey across Mexico and the U.S. border, bringing Ricardo but leaving 3-year-old Jose Ramon behind. The decision seemed prudent at the time, but it kept gnawing at her.\par \par \uc2 The family built a modest life in the Maryland suburbs, with Ramon able to work steadily as a janitor after he obtained refugee status. Rosario added income from part-time kitchen and babysitting jobs, but she had arrived too late to apply for the same legal protection. She lived cautiously, taking buses so as not to get caught driving illegally.\par \par \uc2 The couple often talked about trying to visit Jose Ramon or bringing him to the United States, but each time they decided it was too dangerous. Instead, as he grew older, they kept in touch by Skype.\par \par \uc2 "I help him with his homework, but I just want to have him with us as a family, especially at Christmas," Reyes said.\par \par \uc2 But it was the chance to help Ricardo become legal, after 17 years in the United States, that drew Reyes to the immigrant cause. Like many other Latino parents in Maryland, she said she started attending events to demand protection for "dreamers" like him. That June, Obama signed an executive order offering "deferred deportation" for qualified illegal youths, and Ricardo's application was approved.\par \par \uc2 Reyes, inspired by that experience, decided to participate in a "fast for families" on the Mall last November, organized by church, labor and immigrant groups to press \uc2 the House\uc2  to pass immigration reform. She dropped out after two days, but the hunger strike went on for three weeks, gaining nationwide attention.\par \par \uc2 This time, when local activists asked her to join a new fast asking Obama to take action on his own, she immediately said yes.\par \par \uc2 By Tuesday, after going without food for nine days, she had lost 14 pounds. Her back ached from sleeping in a wooden bunk at \uc2 National City Christian Church\uc2 . She said she was determined to keep going but worried about the coming cold and missed her family.\par \par \uc2 "When is Obama coming back from China?" Reyes asked, peering at the White House lit up in the dark across the stone plaza. "Do you think he'll be able to see us?"\par \par \uc2 By Friday, the fast had collapsed - a casualty of hunger, descending wintry weather and squabbles among the strikers. But in a way, Reyes felt they had succeeded anyway, because the news was full of talk about Obama taking action soon.\par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com\par \par \uc2 WP20141115reyesdeport1115\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020141115eabf00006\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 right-turn\par {\*\bkmkstart toc49}{\*\bkmkend toc49}\b \uc2 No to the nativists, yes to immigration reform \b0\par\par\uc2 By Jennifer Rubin   \par \uc2 731 \uc2 words\par \uc2 30 October 2014\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2014, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The future of immigration reform rides on two factors. The most important factor will be President Obama's determination to flout \uc2 Congress\uc2  and move unilaterally to alter immigration laws. Should he proceed, a furious reaction will follow and any hope of significant reform will be dashed for the next two years at least. But if Obama looks at election returns and decides that it would be unwise to proceed alone, what then can we expect?\par \par \uc2 First, \uc2 the House\uc2 , if you recall, passed border security legislation to address the surge of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  children along the border, but \uc2 the Senate\uc2  did nothing. If a GOP majority is in place, one can expect \uc2 the Senate\uc2  to take it up. That puts \uc2 Senate\uc2  Democrats in a precarious position. Do they oppose, in a time of national anxiety, necessary border measures? If they do or if the president were to veto the measures, the GOP would no doubt be delighted to run on the issue in 2016.\par \par \uc2 But it would be a mistake for Republicans to stop there. The major complaint of most anti-reform Republicans was that reform under \uc2 the Senate\uc2  bill did not guarantee a secure border before legalization kicked in. But if \uc2 the Senate\uc2  and House do pass tough border security measures, what would be the excuse for not proceeding with additional measures on issues such as H-1B visas for high-skilled workers or a humane solution for children brought here illegally?\par \par \uc2 Alex Nowrasteh of the \uc2 Cato Institute\uc2  argues, "A recent Fusion\u160\'00\'A0poll\u160\'00\'A0of likely millennial voters aged 18 to 34 found that a plurality of 49% support the \uc2 Democratic Party\uc2 's immigration-reform position while only 30% supported the GOP's position. But when the poll asks whom the respondent blames for the failure of immigration reform, 12% blamed the Democrats, 15% blamed President Obama, and 30% blamed both political parties. Thirty-three percent blamed the Republicans in \uc2 Congress\uc2 . Looking at the Fusion poll, the best political hope for a GOP nativist strategy is that few voters notice it\u8212\'20\'14hardly a ringing endorsement." He reminds us that the\u160\'00\'A0Federalist Party, the Whigs and the "nativist American Party (also known as the Know-Nothings) quickly rose but then failed after a few successful elections. Anti-immigration positions may have helped those embattled parties for an election or two but in the long run they turned off more voters than they attracted."\par \par \uc2 At a time when economic growth must be ignited, it is ultimately poor politics and poor policy to try to keep out those coming here to work hard and contribute to the American economy. It is not very Republican, for one thing. ("Lincoln divorced the new Republican Party from nativism. . . . Modern Republicans would be wise to learn from Lincoln's inclusive vision. A nativist turn would rebuke the party's principles while paying a high long-term political cost.") And it ignores the growth potential derived from welcoming productive people. Yuval Levin and others have raised a legitimate concern about harm to low-wage workers, but this is one element that can be addressed, not a reason for refusing to act. Moreover, a successful compromise need not include citizenship. Former Florida governor Jeb Bush and others make the case for nationalization instead, which allows millions to live here without fear of deportation.\par \par \uc2 Certainly, fiscal conservatives, pro-defense conservatives and social conservatives can find some common ground by fixing the border and then proceeding to other issues. Fiscal conservatives look for growth opportunities. National-security Republicans are legitimately worried about a border and visa system that lets people come in and remain who would do harm to Americans. And social conservatives, eager to support family values and promote civic virtues (including assimilation, which can be promoted in the legalization process), have something to gain as well.\par \par \uc2 If Republicans come up with a tough-minded policy that addresses a number of issues (e.g. workplace verification, border security, high-skilled workers) and Obama chooses to veto it, then the Democrats will have to explain why they did nothing when they controlled the White House and both houses and again when the other party took the initiative. Republicans have a unique chance to become the party of national security and legal, economically smart immigration policy. They shouldn't blow it.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020141030eaau004h6\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 the-fix\par {\*\bkmkstart toc50}{\*\bkmkend toc50}\b \uc2 Larry Klayman is suing the federal government because of Ebola. Yes, really. \b0\par\par\uc2 By Abby Ohlheiser   \par \uc2 991 \uc2 words\par \uc2 15 October 2014\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2014, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The Ebola virus is secretly a biological weapon allowed into the country by the Obama administration to further terrorist interests against Americans of the\u160\'00\'A0"Caucasian race and\u160\'00\'A0Jewish-Christian religion" according to a new lawsuit\u160\'00\'A0filed Tuesday against several members of the administration.\par \par \uc2 The complaint by\u160\'00\'A0Larry Klayman reads like a\u160\'00\'A027-page\u160\'00\'A0amplification\u160\'00\'A0of many of the fears swirling around the two cases of the Ebola virus diagnosed in the United States in recent weeks. In this instance, that fear is steeped in several long-stewing conspiracy theories about\u160\'00\'A0the current executive branch.\par \par \uc2 That's not surprising, given its author: Klayman\u160\'00\'A0is\u160\'00\'A0a well-known legal activist who believes that Obama was not born in the United States. He's filed "hundreds" of\u160\'00\'A0lawsuits against everything from the Obama administration to \uc2 Judicial Watch\uc2 ,\u160\'00\'A0an organization he founded. Sometimes, those suits are at least moderately successful in court: His case challenging a portion of the\u160\'00\'A0\uc2 NSA\uc2 's surveillance practices is pending before the\u160\'00\'A0U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit after a federal judge\u160\'00\'A0issued a blistering decision in his favor.\par \par \uc2 In his latest suit, Klayman argues that the new Ebola screening procedures at five U.S. airports aren't rigorous enough to stop the transmission of Ebola into the U.S. A lot of\u160\'00\'A0Americans agree with him on that point, if a recent poll is any indication:\u160\'00\'A0two thirds of Americans would support flight restrictions from Ebola-stricken countries\u160\'00\'A0in the name of stopping further Ebola cases here, according to new Washington Post-ABC News numbers.\par \par \uc2 However, it\u160\'00\'A0seems unlikely that such a strong majority of Americans will follow Klayman's assertion\u160\'00\'A0as to why the administration isn't pursuing\u160\'00\'A0flight bans or other more drastic prevention actions.\par \par \uc2 The Obama administration's current screening strategy is actually\u160\'00\'A0"a reckless plan to open the door not just to Defendant Obama's infected fellow Africans, but also American Muslim ISIS suicide terrorists who would intentionally infect themselves with the deadly disease and thus spread it widely in the United States," the complaint reads.\u160\'00\'A0(Klayman believes Obama is a secret Muslim, which he points out elsewhere in the complaint).\par \par \uc2 Klayman\u160\'00\'A0also claims in the complaint, among other things, that the defendants\u160\'00\'A0"have actual knowledge of a substantial risk and actuality that Ebola will be transmitted through the air to infect others."\u160\'00\'A0Ebola is only transmitted through direct contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person, the \uc2 CDC\uc2  and other international health officials have repeatedly said. There is no substantial evidence that the current outbreak, which has\u160\'00\'A0killed more than 4,000 in West Africa, is\u160\'00\'A0transmitting person-to-person through the air, or that the virus has a high likelihood of becoming airborne in the near future.\par \par \uc2 In a brief phone interview with The Post, Klayman addressed the discrepancy between his complaint's claims and the \uc2 CDC\uc2 's publicly-available information on Ebola transmission:\u160\'00\'A0"I\u160\'00\'A0firmly believe the \uc2 CDC\uc2 \u160\'00\'A0is not telling the truth, that [Ebola]\u160\'00\'A0can be transmitted through the air," he said.("The \uc2 CDC\uc2  knows that airborne transmission of Ebola is likely, but has lied to the\u160\'00\'A0American people, at the direction of Defendant Obama, to the contrary," Klayman wrote in the complaint.)\par \par \uc2 Klayman argues that he has standing to sue the government in this particular case because he was "exposed to the Ebola virus" while flying into Newark airport in New Jersey. Klayman says he was on a plane flying into the airport when the \uc2 CDC\uc2  held a news\u160\'00\'A0conference on the new airport screenings. He watched the news\u160\'00\'A0conference while in flight, he added.\par \par \uc2 During that news\u160\'00\'A0conference, Klayman said, a \uc2 CDC\uc2  spokesperson called Newark airport a "high risk" airport for Ebola contraction, due to the relatively large number of West African travelers who pass through the airport compared to others in the country.\par \par \uc2 When asked whether he believes he is currently at risk of becoming symptomatic with the Ebola virus in the next several days due to his travel through Newark, Klayman responded, "I don't know." He referred further questions on the degree and specifics of that perceived risk to the language in his\u160\'00\'A0complaint.\par \par \uc2 When asked how it is possible for Newark airport to contain the Ebola virus at all, when there are no confirmed cases of symptomatic patients in or traveling through the airport, Klayman responded, "I don't believe\u160\'00\'A0the government."\par \par \uc2 The suit also makes mention of the current enterovirus D68 outbreak among American children. Klayman's complaint alleges that the current spread of what appears to be a particularly severe strain of the common\u160\'00\'A0seasonal illness originates with "\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  children who crossed the Mexican border this summer," and "carried the disease when the Obama administration scattered them throughout the United States."\par \par \uc2 Klayman's claim that the Ebola outbreak is part of a potential terror plot against Americans is not new. However, several experts have pointed out in recent weeks that Ebola, as far as diseases go, is a\u160\'00\'A0pretty terrible choice for biological warfare\u160\'00\'A0in a country with an adequate health-care system, in part because of its relatively low transmission rate. In other words, it would take quite a lot of work to turn Ebola into even a moderately effective biological weapon, something that no one has done to date.\par \par \uc2 Of course, if one believes that the Ebola virus is secretly airborne and its transmission\u160\'00\'A0characteristics are\u160\'00\'A0the subject of a massive government cover-up in the name of aiding terrorism, then all that information is\u160\'00\'A0moot.\par \par \uc2 The complaint was filed to the U.S. District Court in D.C. For good measure, Klayman ends the complaint by requesting that Obama be referred to the Department of Homeland Security for deportation, because "he is not even a naturalized U.S. citizen and thus is in the United States illegally."\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020141014eaae006pr\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Style\par {\*\bkmkstart toc51}{\*\bkmkend toc51}\b \uc2 The club Julia Pierson is joining: Life after a Washington scandal; The head of the Secret Service resigned amid controversy, which is a well-worn path in Washington.\b0\par\par\uc2 By Ben Terris;Ellen McCarthy;Lillian Cunningham   \par \uc2 2,108 \uc2 words\par \uc2 9 October 2014\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2014, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 It may be lonely at the top, but there's no shortage of company among the fallen.\par \par \uc2 In that respect, the society that former Secret Service director Julia Pierson just joined is as long as it is elite. Its members have faced the kind of firing squad that only Washington can bring. The long-faced testimony before Congress. The lambasting by cable news pundits. And of course, the eventual, reluctant resignation.\par \par \uc2 "It's painful to leave as the agency is reeling from a significant security breach," Pierson told Bloomberg News last week. But, she added, it's "the noble thing" to step down and "take the pressure off the organization."\par \par \uc2 Take heart, Julia Pierson. While we cannot guarantee your brethren meet for regular keg parties, we do know that there is life after being in (or nearly in) the administration. Look to those who've gone before you \u8212\'20\'14 take up writing, radio commentary or some long-latent passion. Stay in Washington \u8212\'20\'14 or don't. Shill for wholesale guns and ammo as former FEMA director Michael Brown has taken to doing on his radio show's Web site, or give a TED talk and start up a consulting firm in Alexandria, Va., like retired Army Gen. \uc2 Stanley A. McChrystal\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Whatever you do, carry on with the knowledge that the Washington controversy ecosphere has already moved on, looking for its next target.\par \par \uc2 As proof, we checked on a few others who spent time under the same bus you've been under \u8212\'20\'14 and lived to tell about it.\par \par \uc2 Martha Johnson\par \par \uc2 Watching Pierson's testimony on Capitol Hill last week, Martha Johnson had flashbacks. Two years ago, Johnson was in that same hot seat, answering questions from several of the same lawmakers about her agency's failures. "I know that feeling," she said last week, "sitting there and facing the little microphone lights and the clock and looking up at the members of Congress."\par \par \uc2 Johnson, too, resigned during President Obama's tenure. In her case, the scandal was about egregious spending on a conference in October 2010 held by the \uc2 General Services Administration\uc2 , which she led at the time. The agency made headlines for violating contractor guidelines and wasting taxpayer dollars on hotel suites, expensive sushi and blackjack dealer vests. Johnson wasn't present at the conference and the planning began before her tenure, but it transpired on her watch.\par \par \uc2 After Johnson's congressional hearing, she says, she cried in the Metro. All her composure was used up in that room. She can imagine what Pierson feels right now, that sense of mourning.\par \par \uc2 In the months following her resignation, as the condolence cards petered out, Johnson penned a novel about a gay teenager in a small Indiana town. She found a certain comfort in fiction, and in the control it gave her over a story's outcome.\par \par \uc2 After a period of distancing herself from an unraveled career, Johnson is searching for lessons from her time in government that might help others. She is writing books, blogging, speaking and consulting about leadership challenges.\par \par \uc2 Johnson didn't particularly want to watch Pierson's hearing on television, but she tuned in for part of it from her home in Annapolis, Md., where she spends most of her days.\par \par \uc2 "I feel I owe it to her to pay attention," Johnson says. "It's a sisterhood thing."\par \par \uc2 John H. Sununu\par \par \uc2 Sick of former politicos landing gigs yammering on your television screen? You can blame John H. Sununu for that.\par \par \uc2 After serving three years as \uc2 George H.W. Bush\uc2 's right-hand man, Sununu was forced to resign from the position of chief of staff, only to quickly land a gig co-hosting \uc2 CNN\uc2 's "Crossfire."\par \par \uc2 "Nobody had ever gone from government service right to TV. I'm pretty sure I was the only one who ever did it," Sununu said in an interview last week. "It was a great transition. I went back to a pretty decent income, and I didn't have to worry about causing a problem for the guy I worked for. I could be as irresponsible as I wanted on 'Crossfire.'\u8201\'20\'09"\par \par \uc2 Nice landing for a guy who resigned from the White House in 1991, saying he didn't want to be "a drag" on the president's reelection chances. For Sununu, there wasn't one major scandal that led to his departure. It was a combination of his alienating the media, \uc2 Cabinet\uc2  and Congress with his abrasiveness; his role in helping shape a floundering presidency; and maybe his use of military aircraft and government limos for personal business.\par \par \uc2 Sununu, like many administration officials, had become a symbol for disarray plaguing the White House. And it's always easier to vaporize a symbol than, say, get a domestic policy back on track.\par \par \uc2 "I had no problem with that," Sununu says now. "That's what I signed up for. You come in with a certain amount of political capital and if you're doing your job right, you spend your political capital and not the president's."\par \par \uc2 The real beauty for Sununu is that he doesn't think his ignominious departure had any effect on the trajectory of his life afterward. In addition to working on "Crossfire" from 1992 to 1998, Sununu went back to work as a consultant. "I never had to scramble to fill in dead time," he says.\par \par \uc2 Even as a political figure, Sununu has maintained an exalted position. He was the chairman of the New Hampshire Republican Party from 2009 until 2011. And by virtue of being in New Hampshire, he's a popular guy.\par \par \uc2 "Everyone thinking about 2016 comes up and has coffee," he says. "Anyone who knocks on the door, I'm happy to talk to them. But I'm 75 going on 76 and am about ready to slow down."\par \par \uc2 Linda Chavez\par \par \uc2 When \uc2 Linda Chavez\uc2  withdrew her nomination to become \uc2 George W. Bush\uc2 's labor secretary in 2001, she cited "search and destroy" politics as the force that made her walk away. The source of the furor? She said she had given safe harbor and charity to a Guatemalan woman in need. Her critics claimed she knowingly employed an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 So her career in the administration was over before it began.\par \par \uc2 "What was that song that was popular a few years ago?" she asks. "\u8201\'20\'09'I get knocked down. I get up again.' That's the story of my life. In some ways, I've always been reinventing myself."\par \par \uc2 Chavez has gone from Democrat to Republican, from Western girl to East Coast woman, from politico to commentator and back again. Consistent through all those changes, she says, has been her advocacy for workers' rights and immigration reform.\par \par \uc2 Now there is this: writing fiction from her home in Boulder, Colo. In 2010, after writing two nonfiction books, she enrolled in the master of fine arts program at \uc2 George Mason University\uc2  to study creative writing.\par \par \uc2 Some of her professors were "quite astounded when they found who they had in their class," she says. "But they were wonderful."\par \par \uc2 Three of the five short stories she has published in recent years revolve around the North Korean prison system, a topic she became fascinated with during a stint with the United Nations Human Rights Commission. She is also at work on a novel based on her family's buried history as "conversos," Spanish Jews who converted to Christianity to avoid persecution during the Inquisition.\par \par \uc2 Chavez, who moved to Colorado in 2012, founded the \uc2 Center for Equal Opportunity\uc2 , a conservative think tank focused on race-related issues. And her newest project is the Becoming American Institute, a one-woman shop aimed at changing the way conservatives think about immigration.\par \par \uc2 Her parting thought for Pierson \u8212\'20\'14 or anyone who finds herself on the wrong end of the Washington wringer \u8212\'20\'14 is this: "If you really know who you are and what you're about and what you want to accomplish, then setbacks like this don't have to be the end of the world."\par \par \uc2 Alberto Gonzales\par \par \uc2 "After much thought and consideration, I believe this is the right time for my family and I to begin a new chapter in our lives," \uc2 Alberto Gonzales\uc2  wrote to President \uc2 George W. Bush\uc2  in August 2007.\par \par \uc2 The attorney general tendered his resignation in the wake of the contentious firing of nine U.S. attorneys, purportedly for political reasons.\par \par \uc2 Right away, he got to spend more time with his family.\par \par \uc2 "That first day, I got to drive my son to the bus stop," he says today. "I realized right away how much I had missed. .\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09. I would miss being involved [with the Justice Department], but you always know those jobs aren't permanent."\par \par \uc2 But being on the front page of national newspapers for being at the center of a scandal can have an impact on job prospects.\par \par \uc2 Before his name was dragged through the mud, he says, there were a number of \uc2 Fortune\uc2  500 companies that were interested in having him work for them, but those opportunities vanished.\par \par \uc2 "Of course, it bothered me at the time," he says. "It was a decision based upon incomplete and inaccurate facts. An image that was not true about my service. But these companies have stockholders to worry about. So, yeah, it bothers me, but it wouldn't cause me to have done anything differently."\par \par \uc2 Instead, Gonzales spent some time working for himself. He worked as a mediator, helping out with patent-infringement cases and other commercial mediation. Being put through the wringer by lawmakers and the media, being called out for saying almost 70 times in a single congressional hearing that he couldn't remember the details that led to the firings, took a toll on him (and an even bigger toll on his wife), he says.\par \par \uc2 Getting to spend time with the family gave him an added bonus. Gonzales took his son to Nashville for a college visit a few years back. A few months later, it wasn't just his son who would be heading to college in Tennessee. Belmont University Law School offered him a teaching job, and this year, he became the dean of the law school.\par \par \uc2 "Over time, the way people view me is going to be better, much like the Bush administration," he says, noting that many of the policies derided during the Bush years are still in place under Obama. "I hope there are still chapters left to write in my story but what that will be, I don't know."\par \par \uc2 One thing is for sure: "I have no problems sleeping, absolutely not."\par \par \uc2 Michael Brown\par \par \uc2 When things go wrong for Obama, it's inevitable that someone \u8212\'20\'14 usually on television \u8212\'20\'14 will posit: "Is this Obama's Katrina?" It's a good shorthand for a completely bungled situation, for the personification of ineptitude.\par \par \uc2 And that's kind of a bummer for Michael Brown, the former FEMA director who became the face of the \uc2 George W. Bush\uc2  administration's incompetence before resigning just weeks after the storm. (In a sense, it was what he was asking for. On the day of the hurricane, he sent an e-mail to another FEMA official that said: "Can I quit now?").\par \par \uc2 These days, \uc2 Brown\uc2  can be found every weekday on the AM side of the radio dial in the Denver area. He hosts a show from 4 to 7 p.m. (called "The Michael Brown Show") where he talks about the news of the day from a conservative perspective. And lest anyone forget about his past life, the show begins with \u8212\'20\'14 among other things \u8212\'20\'14 an audio clip of former president \uc2 George W. Bush\uc2  saying: "Brownie, you're doing a heckuva job."\par \par \uc2 When Hurricane Sandy hit in 2012, \uc2 Brown\uc2  saw an opening for his kind of expertise, going on Fox and writing an op-ed for a Canadian newspaper in which he said "Hurricane Sandy should teach all of us to chill." His point was that it was a good excuse for people to unplug from their laptops etc.\par \par \uc2 Last week, \uc2 Brown\uc2  discussed his feelings about the term "\uc2 Redskins\uc2 " (he said people needed "to get thick skins"); he talked about PETA, new rules in California about what constitutes sexual assault on college campuses, and, of course, he talked about Pierson's resignation.\par \par \uc2 "The incompetence that permeates this administration is simply mind-boggling," he said.\par \par \uc2 benjamin.terris@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 ellen.nakashima@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 lillian.cunningham@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020141005eaa5005eh\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved   \par \par \uc2 Secret Service Director Julia Pierson is sworn in to testify at a House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing Sept. 30. Pierson resigned the following day. (Photo by Kevin Lamarque/Reuters)\par \par \uc2 It may be lonely at the top, but there's no shortage of company among the fallen.\par \par \uc2 In that respect, the society that former Secret Service director Julia Pierson just joined is as long as it is elite. Its members have faced the kind of firing squad that only Washington can bring. The long-faced testimony before \uc2 Congress\uc2 . The lambasting by cable news pundits. And of course, the eventual, reluctant resignation.\par \par \uc2 "It's painful to leave as the agency is reeling from a significant security breach," Pierson told Bloomberg News last week. But, she added, it's "the noble thing" to step down and "take the pressure off the organization."\par \par \uc2 Take heart, Julia Pierson. While we cannot guarantee your brethren meet for regular keg parties, we do know that there is life after being in (or nearly in) the administration. Look to those who've gone before you - take up writing, radio commentary or some long-latent passion. Stay in Washington - or don't. Shill for wholesale guns and ammo as former FEMA director Michael Brown has taken to doing on his radio show's Web site, or give a TED talk and start up a consulting firm in Alexandria, Va., like retired Army Gen. \uc2 Stanley A. McChrystal\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Whatever you do, carry on with the knowledge that the Washington controversy ecosphere has already moved on, looking for its next target.\par \par \uc2 As proof, we checked on a few others who spent time under the same bus you've been under - and lived to tell about it.\par \par \uc2 Martha Johnson testified before \uc2 Congress\uc2  on April 16, 2012, shortly after resigning as head of the \uc2 General Services Administration\uc2 . Johnson stepped down after an investigation revealed egregious spending by her agency at a conference in Las Vegas. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\par \par \uc2 Watching Pierson's testimony on Capitol Hill last week, Martha Johnson had flashbacks. Two years ago, Johnson was in that same hot seat, answering questions from several of the same lawmakers about her agency's failures. "I know that feeling," she said last week, "sitting there and facing the little microphone lights and the clock and looking up at the members of \uc2 Congress\uc2 ."\par \par \uc2 Johnson, too, resigned during President Obama's tenure. In her case, the scandal was about egregious spending on a conference in October 2010 held by the \uc2 General Services Administration\uc2 , which she led at the time. The agency made headlines for violating contractor guidelines and wasting taxpayer dollars on hotel suites, expensive sushi and blackjack dealer vests. Johnson wasn't present at the conference and the planning began before her tenure, but it transpired on her watch.\par \par \uc2 After Johnson's congressional hearing, she says, she cried in the Metro. All her composure was used up in that room. She can imagine what Pierson feels right now, that sense of mourning.\par \par \uc2 In the months following her resignation, as the condolence cards petered out, Johnson penned a novel about a gay teenager in a small Indiana town. She found a certain comfort in fiction, and in the control it gave her over a story's outcome.\par \par \uc2 After a period of distancing herself from an unraveled career, Johnson is searching for lessons from her time in government that might help others. She is writing books, blogging, speaking and consulting about leadership challenges.\par \par \uc2 Johnson didn't particularly want to watch Pierson's hearing on television, but she tuned in for part of it from her home in Annapolis, Md., where she spends most of her days.\par \par \uc2 "I feel I owe it to her to pay attention," Johnson says. "It's a sisterhood thing."\par \par \uc2 In 1991, John H. Sununu - pictured speaking to the media after announcing his resignation - decided to step down as White House chief of staff so as not to be "a drag" on President \uc2 George H.W. Bush\uc2 . (Photo by Dirck Halstead/Life Images Collection/Getty Images)\par \par \uc2 Sick of former politicos landing gigs yammering on your television screen? You can blame John H. Sununu for that.\par \par \uc2 After serving three years as \uc2 George H.W. Bush\uc2 's right-hand man, Sununu was forced to resign from the position of chief of staff, only to quickly land a gig co-hosting \uc2 CNN\uc2 's "Crossfire."\par \par \uc2 "Nobody had ever gone from government service right to TV. I'm pretty sure I was the only one who ever did it," Sununu said in an interview last week. "It was a great transition. I went back to a pretty decent income, and I didn't have to worry about causing a problem for the guy I worked for. I could be as irresponsible as I wanted on 'Crossfire.' "\par \par \uc2 Nice landing for a guy who resigned from the White House in 1991, saying he didn't want to be "a drag" on the president's reelection chances. For Sununu, there wasn't one major scandal that led to his departure. It was a combination of his alienating the media, \uc2 Cabinet\uc2  and \uc2 Congress\uc2  with his abrasiveness; his role in helping shape a floundering presidency; and maybe his use of military aircraft and government limos for personal business.\par \par \uc2 Sununu, like many administration officials, had become a symbol for disarray plaguing the White House. And it's always easier to vaporize a symbol than, say, get a domestic policy back on track.\par \par \uc2 "I had no problem with that," Sununu says now. "That's what I signed up for. You come in with a certain amount of political capital and if you're doing your job right, you spend your political capital and not the president's."\par \par \uc2 The real beauty for Sununu is that he doesn't think his ignominious departure had any effect on the trajectory of his life afterward. In addition to working on "Crossfire" from 1992 to 1998, Sununu went back to work as a consultant. "I never had to scramble to fill in dead time," he says.\par \par \uc2 Even as a political figure, Sununu has maintained an exalted position. He was the chairman of the New Hampshire Republican Party from 2009 until 2011. And by virtue of being in New Hampshire, he's a popular guy.\par \par \uc2 "Everyone thinking about 2016 comes up and has coffee," he says. "Anyone who knocks on the door, I'm happy to talk to them. But I'm 75 going on 76 and am about ready to slow down."\par \par \uc2 Linda Chavez\uc2  announced that she was withdrawing as President-elect \uc2 George W. Bush\uc2 's nominee for secretary of labor during a news conference on Jan. 9, 2001. (Photo by Doug Mills/Associated Press)\par \par \uc2 When \uc2 Linda Chavez\uc2  withdrew her nomination to become \uc2 George W. Bush\uc2 's labor secretary in 2001, she cited "search and destroy" politics as the force that made her walk away. The source of the furor? She said she had given safe harbor and charity to a Guatemalan woman in need. Her critics claimed she knowingly employed an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 So her career in the administration was over before it began.\par \par \uc2 "What was that song that was popular a few years ago?" she asks. " 'I get knocked down. I get up again.' That's the story of my life. In some ways, I've always been reinventing myself."\par \par \uc2 Chavez has gone from Democrat to Republican, from Western girl to East Coast woman, from politico to commentator and back again. Consistent through all those changes, she says, has been her advocacy for workers' rights and immigration reform.\par \par \uc2 Now there is this: writing fiction from her home in Boulder, Colo. In 2010, after writing two nonfiction books, she enrolled in the master of fine arts program at \uc2 George Mason University\uc2  to study creative writing.\par \par \uc2 Some of her professors were "quite astounded when they found who they had in their class," she says. "But they were wonderful."\par \par \uc2 Three of the five short stories she has published in recent years revolve around the North Korean prison system, a topic she became fascinated with during a stint with the United Nations Human Rights Commission. She is also at work on a novel based on her family's buried history as "conversos," Spanish Jews who converted to Christianity to avoid persecution during the Inquisition.\par \par \uc2 Chavez, who moved to Colorado in 2012, founded the \uc2 Center for Equal Opportunity\uc2 , a conservative think tank focused on race-related issues. And her newest project is the Becoming American Institute, a one-woman shop aimed at changing the way conservatives think about immigration.\par \par \uc2 Her parting thought for Pierson - or anyone who finds herself on the wrong end of the Washington wringer - is this: "If you really know who you are and what you're about and what you want to accomplish, then setbacks like this don't have to be the end of the world."\par \par \uc2 Attorney General \uc2 Alberto Gonzales\uc2  addresses the news media on Aug. 27, 2007. Gonzales resigned after months of accusations that he politicized the Justice Department and misled \uc2 Congress\uc2  over the firing of federal prosecutors and wiretapping of suspected terrorists. (Photo by Jamie Rose/Bloomberg News)\par \par \uc2 "After much thought and consideration, I believe this is the right time for my family and I to begin a new chapter in our lives," \uc2 Alberto Gonzales\uc2  wrote to President \uc2 George W. Bush\uc2  in August 2007.\par \par \uc2 The attorney general tendered his resignation in the wake of the contentious firing of nine U.S. attorneys, purportedly for political reasons.\par \par \uc2 Right away, he got to spend more time with his family.\par \par \uc2 "That first day, I got to drive my son to the bus stop," he says today. "I realized right away how much I had missed. . . . I would miss being involved [with the Justice Department], but you always know those jobs aren't permanent."\par \par \uc2 But being on the front page of national newspapers for being at the center of a scandal can have an impact on job prospects.\par \par \uc2 Before his name was dragged through the mud, he says, there were a number of \uc2 Fortune\uc2  500 companies that were interested in having him work for them, but those opportunities vanished.\par \par \uc2 "Of course, it bothered me at the time," he says. "It was a decision based upon incomplete and inaccurate facts. An image that was not true about my service. But these companies have stockholders to worry about. So, yeah, it bothers me, but it wouldn't cause me to have done anything differently."\par \par \uc2 Instead, Gonzales spent some time working for himself. He worked as a mediator, helping out with patent-infringement cases and other commercial mediation. Being put through the wringer by lawmakers and the media, being called out for saying almost 70 times in a single congressional hearing that he couldn't remember the details that led to the firings, took a toll on him (and an even bigger toll on his wife), he says.\par \par \uc2 Getting to spend time with the family gave him an added bonus. Gonzales took his son to Nashville for a college visit a few years back. A few months later, it wasn't just his son who would be heading to college in Tennessee. Belmont University Law School offered him a teaching job, and this year, he became the dean of the law school.\par \par \uc2 "Over time, the way people view me is going to be better, much like the Bush administration," he says, noting that many of the policies derided during the Bush years are still in place under Obama. "I hope there are still chapters left to write in my story but what that will be, I don't know."\par \par \uc2 One thing is for sure: "I have no problems sleeping, absolutely not."\par \par \uc2 FEMA chief Michael Brown looks on as Homeland Security Secretary \uc2 Michael Chertoff\uc2  speaks during a news conference Sept. 9, 2005, in Baton Rouge. \uc2 Brown\uc2  was removed from his role managing Hurricane Katrina and resigned less than a week later. (by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)\par \par \uc2 When things go wrong for Obama, it's inevitable that someone - usually on television - will posit: "Is this Obama's Katrina?" It's a good shorthand for a completely bungled situation, for the personification of ineptitude.\par \par \uc2 And that's kind of a bummer for Michael Brown, the former FEMA director who became the face of the \uc2 George W. Bush\uc2  administration's incompetence before resigning just weeks after the storm. (In a sense, it was what he was asking for. On the day of the hurricane, he sent an e-mail to another FEMA official that said: "Can I quit now?").\par \par \uc2 These days, \uc2 Brown\uc2  can be found every weekday on the AM side of the radio dial in the Denver area. He hosts a show from 4 to 7 p.m. (called "The Michael Brown Show") where he talks about the news of the day from a conservative perspective. And lest anyone forget about his past life, the show begins with - among other things - an audio clip of former president \uc2 George W. Bush\uc2  saying: "Brownie, you're doing a heckuva job."\par \par \uc2 When Hurricane Sandy hit in 2012, \uc2 Brown\uc2  saw an opening for his kind of expertise, going on Fox and writing an op-ed for a Canadian newspaper in which he said "Hurricane Sandy should teach all of us to chill." His point was that it was a good excuse for people to unplug from their laptops etc.\par \par \uc2 Last week, \uc2 Brown\uc2  discussed his feelings about the term "\uc2 Redskins\uc2 " (he said people needed "to get thick skins"); he talked about PETA, new rules in California about what constitutes sexual assault on college campuses, and, of course, he talked about Pierson's resignation.\par \par \uc2 "The incompetence that permeates this administration is simply mind-boggling," he said.\par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com\par \par \uc2 WP20141006resigned1006\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020141006eaa600019\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved   \par \par \uc2 "You worked hard all your life. You paid into Social Security. You counted on it being there - for you. But liberals in Washington want to let illegal immigrants get Social Security for work they did with forged identities. And when they needed one vote, they got it - from Sen. Mark Pryor. On illegal immigration, Mark Pryor never takes your side."\par \par \uc2 - Voice-over for a new ad from the Tom Cotton for \uc2 Senate\uc2  campaign\par \par \uc2 The Senate\uc2  race in Arkansas is getting increasingly nasty. While the Fact Checker was on break, Sen. Mark Pryor (D) issued an ad that falsely suggested Rep. Tom Cotton, his GOP opponent, was responsible for the spread of the Ebola virus because of a vote he had cast. The ad was widely criticized in the state and earned a "mostly false" rating from PolitiFact.\par \par \uc2 Now, Cotton has fired back with his own misleading ad. It opens with grainy, sepia-toned images of workers in apparently a bygone time and then charges that Pryor (and "liberals in Washington," as the ad flashes images of House Democratic leader \uc2 Nancy Pelosi\uc2  and President Obama) want to give Social Security benefits to immigrants "for work they did with forged identities."\par \par \uc2 As it turns out, this stems from a 2006 vote, before Obama was president, and it is a claim that has been repeatedly debunked by fact checkers. It even made FactCheck.org's "Whoppers of 2006." But that hasn't stopped the Cotton campaign from dredging up the muck again.\par \par \uc2 The ad first appears to prey on fears about the long-term viability of Social Security, much like Democratic attack ads that claim Republicans such as Cotton want to "privatize" the old-age program. But then it veers into a slam against Pryor's alleged support for illegal immigrants. Undocumented workers are not eligible for Social Security. Yet, with few exceptions, workers in the United States must pay a portion of their earnings to Social Security, which is matched by their employer. Thus workers in the country illegally who have fraudulent or unauthorized Social Security numbers are paying into the system but do not get any benefits.\par \par \uc2 Still, until the law was changed in 2008, the \uc2 Social Security Administration\uc2  would process claims for credit for those payments in benefit calculations if a formerly \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  became a legal resident - and the worker could prove that he or she had made payments to the Social Security system.\par \par \uc2 That's why this ad has to reach back to a vote in 2006. At the urging of President \uc2 George W. Bush\uc2 , \uc2 Congress\uc2  was trying to pass a comprehensive immigration bill. \uc2 David Ray\uc2 , a Cotton campaign spokesman, pointed to an account in the Christian Science Monitor of one important week in the debate as evidence that Pryor cast a crucial vote at the behest of liberal advocates.\par \par \uc2 The newspaper described how Sen. John Ensign (R-Nev.), a foe of the immigration bill, "took the bill's core supporters by surprise" by offering an amendment that would prevent undocumented immigrants from claiming Social Security credit for the years they worked with forged Social Security numbers. The move was intended to break apart a fragile bipartisan coalition for the bill.\par \par \uc2 The newspaper said: "The vote count was 49-49, when Sen. Mark Pryor (D) of Arkansas was walking up the steps toward \uc2 the Senate\uc2  floor. 'Hurry! We need your vote!' cried a Democratic staffer, who had been tracking the vote no one expected would be so close. With Senator Pryor's vote, the amendment was defeated [50 to 49]."\par \par \uc2 The very next paragraph offers an observation from Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), a supporter of the bill who, along with 10 other Republicans, voted against the Ensign amendment: "A lot of us took tough votes where we would have liked to vote the other way, but we didn't, because we wanted to hold the coalition together."\par \par \uc2 In other words, Pryor's vote was part of an effort to defeat a poison pill amendment - and he was joined by a number of Republicans who wanted to keep the bill intact. (For the record, Obama, then a senator, also voted against the amendment.) The broader immigration bill ultimately passed \uc2 the Senate\uc2  by a vote of 62 to 36, but it never became law.\par \par \uc2 But that's not the whole story.\par \par \uc2 In 2007, Ensign twice offered a version of his amendment again - and both times, Pryor voted for it. When Ensign altered his proposal so that it barred the \uc2 Social Security Administration\uc2  from spending money to process such back claims from formerly undocumentedimmigrants, he scored an overwhelming 92 to 2 victory. The provision remains part of the law, and the \uc2 SSA\uc2  refers to it as the "Ensign amendment."\par \par \uc2 That's still not the end of the story.\par \par \uc2 Remember last year's debate over a comprehensive immigration law? Yet another amendment sought to make the ban on receiving past credit permanent (the Ensign amendment, after all, just prevents the spending of money to process claims). Pryor not only voted for this amendment, he was listed as a co-sponsor.\par \par \uc2 To recap, workers who are in the country illegally cannot get Social Security benefits, even if they have paid into the system. They can no longer get credit for those payments even if they become legal residents - because of a change in the law that Pryor supported. Moreover, there is currently no effort in \uc2 Congress\uc2  or the Obama administration to change that reality.\par \par \uc2 Why would a campaign rehash a claim that has been so thoroughly discredited? Polls clearly must show that the allegation moves voters, so the campaign tries to bulldoze past the facts.\par \par \uc2 Voters need to be especially wary of claims that appear to be largely based on votes from many years ago. Cotton is highlighting a minor vote eight years ago, ignoring Pryor's more recent and more substantive votes - not to mention the fact that the law was changed to prevent the processing of such claims.\par \par \uc2 Moreover, no matter what one might think of the initial vote, there's certainly no justification for the ad to assert that "on illegal immigration, Pryor never takes your side" - given that he voted three out of four times against undocumented immigrants on this issue.\par \par \uc2 For reviving a long-discredited claim, in the face of contrary facts, the Cotton campaign earns Four Pinocchios.\par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com\par \par \uc2 WP20140914factchecker0914\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020140914ea9e00066\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 In a rare moment of self-awareness, it appears the White House realized the president's self-imposed deadline for executive action on immigration would inflame moderate voters and sink the already low prospects of the Democrats retaining control of \uc2 the Senate\uc2  in November. But it was probably the least worst decision the White House could have made.\par \par \uc2 Delaying action until after the elections, coupled with how the immigration issue has exploded, still poses a major challenge for Democrats on the 2014 ballot. Do they say the delay is good, thereby admitting they want to dodge voters? Do they say the president should proceed, putting themselves in a position where they have to either support or oppose a liberal overreach on immigration that has some form of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  wave-in at its core? Or do they use mealy-mouth weasel words about wanting to "work with the president on responsible reform," etc. and hope voters don't notice their obvious attempts to avoid taking a stand?\par \par \uc2 If Republicans are artful, they could force the Democrats' hand and try to make them commit to either supporting or opposing the president's anticipated executive action on immigration. It will be difficult for candidates to pretend they don't know what the president is going to propose. It is fair to expect that candidates should be able to answer the simple question of whether or not they will vote to overturn President Obama's executive order, whenever he decides to release it.\par \par \uc2 If you think about it, it is incredibly insulting for the White House to admit, "Sure, we have a plan to take executive action on immigration, but we know it would be so unpopular that we can't expose it just before an election. Voters would be enraged and Democratic candidates would be in open revolt. So we will wait until there is not much voters can do about it." Doesn't that in and of itself inflame voters? Maybe there is so much strife and bad news regarding other issues coming at voters they won't even notice the White House is giving them the finger and patting themselves on the back for being so clever.\par \par \uc2 If we know the president is willing to delay executive action on immigration until after the elections so he gets his way and protects his Democratic allies, it raises the question of what else the president is planning to do after Nov. 4. Be afraid. Be very afraid.\par \par \uc2 Follow Ed on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 :\u160\'00\'A0@EdRogersDC\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020140908ea980048x\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 "You worked hard, all your life. You paid into Social Security. You counted on it being there \u8212\'20\'14 for you. But liberals in Washington want to let illegal immigrants get Social Security for work they did with forged identities. And when they needed one vote, they got it \u8212\'20\'14 from Sen. Mark Pryor. On illegal immigration, Mark Pryor never takes your side."\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14voiceover of new ad from the Tom Cotton (R) for \uc2 Senate\uc2  campaign\par \par \uc2 The Senate\uc2  race in Arkansas is getting increasingly nasty. While the Fact Checker was on break, Sen. Mark Pryor issued an ad that falsely suggested that Rep. Tom Cotton, his GOP opponent, was responsible for the spread of the Ebola virus because of a vote he had cast. The ad was widely criticized in the state, and earned a "mostly false" rating from PolitiFact.\par \par \uc2 Now, Cotton has fired back with his own misleading ad. It opens with grainy, sepia-toned images of workers in apparently a bygone time, and then charges that Pryor (and "liberals in Washington," as the ad flashes images of House Democratic Leader\u160\'00\'A0Nancy Pelosi and President Obama) want to give Social Security benefits "for work they did with forged identities."\par \par \uc2 As it turns out, this stems from a 2006 vote, before Obama was president, and it is a claim that has been repeatedly debunked by fact checkers. It even made FactCheck.org's "Whoppers of 2006." But that hasn't stopped the Cotton campaign from dredging up the muck again.\par \par \uc2 The FactsThe ad first appears to preying on fears about the long-term viability of Social Security, much like Democratic attack ads that claim Republicans such as Cotton want to "privatize" the old-age program. But then it veers into a slam on Pryor's alleged support for illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Undocumented workers\u160\'00\'A0are not eligible for Social Security. Yet with few exceptions, workers in the United States must pay a portion of their earnings to Social Security, which is matched by their employer. Thus workers in the country illegally\u160\'00\'A0who have fraudulent or unauthorized Social Security numbers are paying into the system, but do not get any benefits.\par \par \uc2 Still, until the law was changed in 2008, the \uc2 Social Security Administration\uc2  would process claims for credit for those payments in benefit calculations if a formerly \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  became a legal resident \u8212\'20\'14 and the worker could prove he or she had made payments to the Social Security system.\par \par \uc2 That's why this ad has to reach back to a vote in 2006.\u160\'00\'A0 At the urging of then President \uc2 George W. Bush\uc2 , \uc2 Congress\uc2  was trying to pass a comprehensive immigration bill. \uc2 David Ray\uc2 , a Cotton campaign spokesman, pointed to an account in the Christian Science Monitor of one important week in the debate as evidence for the fact that Pryor cast a crucial vote at the behest of liberal advocates.\par \par \uc2 The newspaper described how Sen. John Ensign (R-Nev.), a foe of the immigration bill, "took the bill's core supporters by surprise" by offering an amendment that would prevent undocumented\u160\'00\'A0immigrants in the United States from claiming Social Security credit for the years they worked with forged Social Security numbers. The move was intended to break apart a fragile bipartisan coalition for the bill. The newspaper added:\par \par \uc2 The vote count was 49-49, when Sen. Mark Pryor (D) of Arkansas was walking up the steps toward \uc2 the Senate\uc2  floor. "Hurry! We need your vote!" cried a Democratic staffer, who had been tracking the vote no one expected would be so close. With Senator Pryor's vote, the amendment was defeated [50-49]. The very next paragraph offers an observation from Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a supporter of the bill, who along with 10 other Republicans voted against the Ensign amendment: "A lot of us took tough votes where we would have liked to vote the other way, but we didn't, because we wanted to hold the coalition together."\par \par \uc2 In other word's Pryor's vote was part of an effort to defeat a poison pill amendment \u8212\'20\'14 and he was joined by a number of Republicans who wanted to keep the bill intact. (For the record, Obama, then a senator, also voted against the amendment.) The broader immigration bill ultimately passed \uc2 the Senate\uc2  by a vote of 62-36, but never became law.\par \par \uc2 But that's not the whole story. In 2007, Ensign twice offered a version of his amendment again \u8212\'20\'14 and both times, Pryor voted for it. When Ensign altered his proposal so that it barred the \uc2 Social Security Administration\uc2  from spending money to process such back claims from formerly\u160\'00\'A0undocumented\u160\'00\'A0immigrants, he scored an overwhelming 92-2 victory. The provision remains in law, and\u160\'00\'A0the \uc2 SSA\uc2  refers to it as the "Ensign amendment."\par \par \uc2 That's still not the end of the story. Remember the 2013 debate over a comprehensive immigration law? Yet another amendment sought to make the ban on receiving past credit permanent (the Ensign Amendment, after all, just prevents the spending of money to process claims). Pryor not only voted for this amendment, but he was listed as a cosponsor as well.\par \par \uc2 To recap, workers who are in the country illegally\u160\'00\'A0cannot get Social Security benefits, even if they have paid into the system. They can no longer get credit for those payments even if they become legal residents\u160\'00\'A0\u8212\'20\'14\u160\'00\'A0because of a change in the law that Pryor supported. Moreover, there is currently no effort in \uc2 Congress\uc2  or the Obama administration to change that reality.\par \par \uc2 The Pinocchio TestWhy would a campaign rehash a claim that has been so thoroughly discredited? Polls clearly must show that the allegation moves voters, enough so the campaign tries to bulldoze past the facts.\par \par \uc2 Voters need to be especially wary of claims that appear to be largely based on votes from many years ago. Cotton is highlighting a minor vote from eight years ago, ignoring Pryor's more recent and more substantive votes \u8212\'20\'14 not to mention the fact that law was changed to prevent the processing of such claims.\par \par \uc2 Moreover, no matter what one might think of the initial vote, there's certainly no justification for the ad to assert that "on illegal immigration, Pryor never takes your side" \u8212\'20\'14 given that he voted three\u160\'00\'A0out of four times against undocumented\u160\'00\'A0immigrants on this issue.\par \par \uc2 For reviving a long-discredited claim, in the face of contrary facts, the Cotton campaign earns Four Pinocchios.\par \par \uc2 Four Pinocchios (About our rating scale)\par \par \uc2 Send us facts to check by filling out this form\par \par \uc2 Follow The Fact Checker on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and friend us on \uc2 Facebook\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020140908ea98002uw\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 "You worked hard, all your life. You paid into Social Security. You counted on it being there \u8212\'20\'14 for you. But liberals in Washington want to let illegal immigrants get Social Security for work they did with forged identities. And when they needed one vote, they got it \u8212\'20\'14 from Sen. Mark Pryor. On illegal immigration, Mark Pryor never takes your side."\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14voiceover of new ad from the Tom Cotton (R) for \uc2 Senate\uc2  campaign\par \par \uc2 The Senate\uc2  race in Arkansas is getting increasingly nasty. While the Fact Checker was on break, Sen. Mark Pryor issued an ad that falsely suggested that Rep. Tom Cotton, his GOP opponent, was responsible for the spread of the Ebola virus because of a vote he had cast. The ad was widely criticized in the state, and earned a "mostly false" rating from PolitiFact.\par \par \uc2 Now, Cotton has fired back with his own misleading ad. It opens with grainy, sepia-toned images of workers in apparently a bygone time, and then charges that Pryor (and "liberals in Washington," as the ad flashes images of House Democratic Leader\u160\'00\'A0Nancy Pelosi and President Obama) want to give Social Security benefits "for work they did with forged identities."\par \par \uc2 As it turns out, this stems from a 2006 vote, before Obama was president, and it is a claim that has been repeatedly debunked by fact checkers. It even made FactCheck.org's "Whoppers of 2006." But that hasn't stopped the Cotton campaign from dredging up the muck again.\par \par \uc2 The Facts\par \par \uc2 The ad first appears to preying on fears about the long-term viability of Social Security, much like Democratic attack ads that claim Republicans such as Cotton want to "privatize" the old-age program. But then it veers into a slam on Pryor's alleged support for illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Undocumented workers\u160\'00\'A0are not eligible for Social Security. Yet with few exceptions, workers in the United States must pay a portion of their earnings to Social Security, which is matched by their employer. Thus workers in the country illegally\u160\'00\'A0who have fraudulent or unauthorized Social Security numbers are paying into the system, but do not get any benefits.\par \par \uc2 Still, until the law was changed in 2008, the \uc2 Social Security Administration\uc2  would process claims for credit for those payments in benefit calculations if a formerly \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  became a legal resident \u8212\'20\'14 and the worker could prove he or she had made payments to the Social Security system.\par \par \uc2 That's why this ad has to reach back to a vote in 2006.\u160\'00\'A0 At the urging of then President \uc2 George W. Bush\uc2 , \uc2 Congress\uc2  was trying to pass a comprehensive immigration bill. \uc2 David Ray\uc2 , a Cotton campaign spokesman, pointed to an account in the Christian Science Monitor of one important week in the debate as evidence for the fact that Pryor cast a crucial vote at the behest of liberal advocates.\par \par \uc2 The newspaper described how Sen. John Ensign (R-Nev.), a foe of the immigration bill, "took the bill's core supporters by surprise" by offering an amendment that would prevent undocumented\u160\'00\'A0immigrants in the United States from claiming Social Security credit for the years they worked with forged Social Security numbers. The move was intended to break apart a fragile bipartisan coalition for the bill. The newspaper added:\par \par \uc2 The vote count was 49-49, when Sen. Mark Pryor (D) of Arkansas was walking up the steps toward \uc2 the Senate\uc2  floor. "Hurry! We need your vote!" cried a Democratic staffer, who had been tracking the vote no one expected would be so close. With Senator Pryor's vote, the amendment was defeated [50-49].\par \par \uc2 The very next paragraph offers an observation from Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a supporter of the bill, who along with 10 other Republicans voted against the Ensign amendment: "A lot of us took tough votes where we would have liked to vote the other way, but we didn't, because we wanted to hold the coalition together."\par \par \uc2 In other word's Pryor's vote was part of an effort to defeat a poison pill amendment \u8212\'20\'14 and he was joined by a number of Republicans who wanted to keep the bill intact. (For the record, Obama, then a senator, also voted against the amendment.) The broader immigration bill ultimately passed \uc2 the Senate\uc2  by a vote of 62-36, but never became law.\par \par \uc2 But that's not the whole story. In 2007, Ensign twice offered a version of his amendment again \u8212\'20\'14 and both times, Pryor voted for it. When Ensign altered his proposal so that it barred the \uc2 Social Security Administration\uc2  from spending money to process such back claims from formerly\u160\'00\'A0undocumented\u160\'00\'A0immigrants, he scored an overwhelming 92-2 victory. The provision remains in law, and\u160\'00\'A0the \uc2 SSA\uc2  refers to it as the "Ensign amendment."\par \par \uc2 That's still not the end of the story. Remember the 2013 debate over a comprehensive immigration law? Yet another amendment sought to make the ban on receiving past credit permanent (the Ensign Amendment, after all, just prevents the spending of money to process claims). Pryor not only voted for this amendment, but he was listed as a cosponsor as well.\par \par \uc2 To recap, workers who are in the country illegally\u160\'00\'A0cannot get Social Security benefits, even if they have paid into the system. They can no longer get credit for those payments even if they become legal residents\u160\'00\'A0\u8212\'20\'14\u160\'00\'A0because of a change in the law that Pryor supported. Moreover, there is currently no effort in \uc2 Congress\uc2  or the Obama administration to change that reality.\par \par \uc2 The Pinocchio Test\par \par \uc2 Why would a campaign rehash a claim that has been so thoroughly discredited? Polls clearly must show that the allegation moves voters, enough so the campaign tries to bulldoze past the facts.\par \par \uc2 Voters need to be especially wary of claims that appear to be largely based on votes from many years ago. Cotton is highlighting a minor vote from eight years ago, ignoring Pryor's more recent and more substantive votes \u8212\'20\'14 not to mention the fact that law was changed to prevent the processing of such claims.\par \par \uc2 Moreover, no matter what one might think of the initial vote, there's certainly no justification for the ad to assert that "on illegal immigration, Pryor never takes your side" \u8212\'20\'14 given that he voted three\u160\'00\'A0out of four times against undocumented\u160\'00\'A0immigrants on this issue.\par \par \uc2 For reviving a long-discredited claim, in the face of contrary facts, the Cotton campaign earns Four Pinocchios.\par \par \uc2 Four Pinocchios\par \par \uc2 (About our rating scale)\par \par \uc2 Send us facts to check by filling out this form\par \par \uc2 Follow The Fact Checker on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and friend us on \uc2 Facebook\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020140908ea9800231\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

Rick Perry, National Guard adjusts to its new role on the Texas border; The troops dispatched with fanfare by Gov. Rick Perry are just the latest force in an increasingly fortified zone.\b0\par\par\uc2 By Antonio Olivo   \par \uc2 1,940 \uc2 words\par \uc2 2 September 2014\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2014, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 RIO GRANDE CITY, Tex. \u8212\'20\'14 The National Guard troops arrived here last week, outfitted in body armor and carrying pistols to help bring more security to the U.S.-Mexico border.\par \par \uc2 Yet they saw little activity after taking their positions in portable towers and Border Patrol vehicles along the dirt roads and levees that overlooked the dense brush near the Rio Grande.\par \par \uc2 Some found themselves fighting boredom, chatting with each other about their lives back home \u8212\'20\'14 where their jobs were altogether different than looking out for armed traffickers \u8212\'20\'14 and wondering how much longer they would be posted in the unforgiving desert heat. Others killed time any way they could during taxing 12-hour shifts watching the silent riverbank.\par \par \uc2 "The music keeps me up," said one soldier listening to old-school R&B tunes who requested anonymity because, as several guardsmen explained, the soldiers were not permitted to speak to the media. "We're keeping our eyes on the brush."\par \par \uc2 The National Guard was dispatched to the border with great fanfare by Texas Gov. Rick Perry (R), who declared in July that he was forced to act because of a string of failures by the federal government in addressing drug smugglers and an influx of unaccompanied Central American minors who had flooded across the border in recent months.\par \par \uc2 As of last week, 400 guardsmen had arrived. A total of 1,000 are expected to gather in the coming weeks, concentrated in this stretch of border on Texas's southernmost tip, running through the Rio Grande Valley from Brownsville to McAllen. This region has been seen as especially vulnerable to illegal crossings.\par \par \uc2 The rollout of the troops has offered Perry a chance to strike a tough tone on illegal immigration as he ponders a run for president in 2016 \u8212\'20\'14 and seeks to undo the political damage from a failed 2012 run in which conservatives attacked him as soft on the issue.\par \par \uc2 In his previous run, Perry told rivals opposed to giving \uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2  children in-state college tuition that "I don't think you have a heart." Now, as he presides over his state's National Guard deployment and blasts President Obama's record on border security, Perry is positioning himself as a border hawk with views closely aligned with the core Republican voters who will play a big role in choosing the party's 2016 White House nominee.\par \par \uc2 But now that the guardsmen have arrived, their exact role, besides keeping watch on the brush, is not entirely clear.\par \par \uc2 The soldiers have undergone training in recent weeks in air and ground surveillance. During their shifts, they stand watch, usually from stations peering out over the river, or while joining Border Patrol units driving around the dusty expanses outside McAllen.\par \par \uc2 In their off-hours they take in their new surroundings from the gangways of hotels with cigarettes or cold beers in hand.\par \par \uc2 These soldiers are only the latest armed force coming to a region that has been militarized for years.\par \par \uc2 Beefed-up border\par \par \uc2 Dramatic funding increases over the past decade for Border Patrol agents and other security measures long ago transformed the area into what can feel like a heavily fortified zone. Perry in June launched "Operation Strong Safety," an $18 million-per-month effort to boost the law enforcement presence near the border.\par \par \uc2 The National Guard deployment is part of that broader buildup, adding to a scene where soldiers in camouflage shuttle to and fro in unmarked but easily recognizable white vans while state police cars sit idling at nearly every highway intersection \u8212\'20\'14 beneath an ever-present white federal government blimp monitoring activities below.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, the number of border crossers has been on the decline in recent weeks, with the flow of unaccompanied minors slowing considerably.\par \par \uc2 The presence of additional soldiers is being greeted here with mixed emotions, with some locals appreciating the added protection and others wondering when enough is enough.\par \par \uc2 The charm of living near cattle ranches and mesquite trees that make up large portions of the Rio Grande Valley is steadily evaporating, residents say.\par \par \uc2 "It's all different. I think the United States is a police state now," said Javier Pe\u241\'00\'F1a, a former police officer in Rio Grande City who had just finished breakfast at the Texas Cafe.\par \par \uc2 Others see the National Guard troops as necessary.\par \par \uc2 "Will the border ever be secure? The answer is that it could be. But the federal government needs to get off the side, get in the game and be a real player and stop pretending," said Rio Grande City Mayor Ruben Villarreal, whose community has seen the brunt of border crossing and drug smuggling.\par \par \uc2 "When these women and children were crossing our border, it opened all of our eyes up," Villarreal said. "They're the more delicate, the more fragile in our society, and they were walking across our border like they were just going through turnstiles at a baseball game."\par \par \uc2 Officials from the Perry administration and the National Guard declined to be interviewed to discuss the soldiers' role.\par \par \uc2 Tom Vinger, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety, which is overseeing the governor's border efforts, said the goal was to "deny Mexican cartels and their associates unfettered entry into Texas between the ports of entry, as well as reduce the power of these organizations, whose success depends on their ability to operate on both sides of the border."\par \par \uc2 A statement from the agency that oversees the state's National Guard, Texas Military Forces, said the soldiers were "amplifying the visible presence on the ground and along the river" in an effort to keep the Rio Grande Valley secure.\par \par \uc2 "Specifically, the Texas National Guard is providing a variety of subject matter experts and equipment primarily involving aviation assets, logistics and ground troops to support the state-led operations along the Texas-Mexico border," the agency said.\par \par \uc2 A spokeswoman with \uc2 U.S. Customs and Border Protection\uc2 , the agency that includes Border Patrol, declined to provide details of how it is working with the National Guard, other than to say that the two agencies are cooperating.\par \par \uc2 The arrival of the Central American children and the National Guard deployment have shaken some local residents who have lived for decades with illegal crossings and smuggling over the shimmering Rio Grande.\par \par \uc2 Back when the flow of people across the river was sporadic and smuggling meant someone's neighbor moved tequila or flour back and forth across the border, it was easy to look the other way and go about your life, local residents say.\par \par \uc2 Now, the situation is far more complicated, with even the former Hidalgo County sheriff serving a five-year prison sentence after pleading guilty to money laundering and accepting campaign donations from an alleged drug trafficker.\par \par \uc2 Hard to ignore\par \par \uc2 The idea that what happens along the Rio Grande is interwoven with life in the valley's small towns and farms extends as far back as the days when Spanish colonial settlers moved goods and livestock to and from Mexico.\par \par \uc2 Ruperto Escobar's roots in the area date to 1767, when one of his ancestors arrived to claim a Spanish land grant that includes his current farm on the riverbank and the town named after his family: Escobares.\par \par \uc2 That history and the decades he spent farming his land taught him a creed repeated by others in the area about the river and illegal activity there, Escobares, 70, said in his Spanish-inflected accent: "I don't bother them, they don't bother me."\par \par \uc2 Over the years, drug traffickers and others headed north have trekked across his land, with Escobar and his workers usually trying to ignore them. Recently, he said, two men with rifles showed up near his irrigation pump, ordering Escobar's workers to clear out because there was different work to be done there that night.\par \par \uc2 He said he realized how faulty his mind-set had become when the Central American children began appearing on the riverbank, followed now by soldiers with semiautomatic pistols strapped to their fatigues \u8212\'20\'14 embodiments of what has become an often surreal lifestyle.\par \par \uc2 "We've been turning this eye away from it for so long that it's gotten out of control," Escobar said, adding that he welcomes the National Guard and any other border enforcement. "Now, we can't handle it. Now, we're afraid. Now, we want someone else to come in and handle it."\par \par \uc2 Others say they are assuming that responsibility.\par \par \uc2 Othal E. Brand Jr., president of Hidalgo County Water Improvement District 3, which provides much of the drinking water for the McAllen area, said he had been frustrated after the federal government built a portion of a border fence around the water district property, leaving portions of the area open to crossers and armed traffickers who often chased away his workers.\par \par \uc2 The property sits not far from a major border crossing by Anzalduas Park, where on a recent afternoon the laughter and banda music being played by a group of families splashing on the Mexican side of the river floated across the water. Last year, Brand said, eight bodies were found nearby in the river, four of them without heads.\par \par \uc2 In the past, however, the area had been hard to reach for Border Patrol agents and other law enforcement agencies. Their boats did not have easy access to the river.\par \par \uc2 About three years ago, Brand persuaded his board to spend $125,000 to build a boat ramp. Another $125,000 was used for the guard tower and bullet-proof wrapping around the water district pump, he said.\par \par \uc2 The expenditures of local funds have stirred controversy. But Brand said the water district property is now a virtual station for federal and state law enforcement officers who are grateful for the boat launch and the free bottles of water and ice Brand provides.\par \par \uc2 "Whatever we do, we've got to do as a state, as a county, as a water district," Brand said. "Forget the feds."\par \par \uc2 About 20 miles away in a rural portion of Hidalgo County, Fred and Josie Cappadona said they are eager to see more law enforcement near their cattle ranch.\par \par \uc2 The couple moved to the area during the early 1970s, shortly after Fred Cappadona, 68, returned from the Vietnam War, where he flew an assault helicopter on missions to the Cambodian border.\par \par \uc2 The silence of South Texas appealed to Cappadona, he said, a tranquility that was initially interrupted only occasionally by a random border crosser attempting to make his way north.\par \par \uc2 The degree of danger encroaching on their family recently burst into view during a birthday party the Cappadonas were holding for one of their grandchildren.\par \par \uc2 A truck traveling about 70 mph raced past a patio where the kids were playing, apparently lost as the driver sought to offload his human cargo. With his .380-caliber pistol within easy reach, Cappadona drove after the truck and asked the driver to slow down before the truck raced off through another fence, he said.\par \par \uc2 That and other encounters make the idea of living with more law enforcement in the area palatable, even if it means losing some of their tranquility, he said.\par \par \uc2 "Yeah, it's not the same," Cappadona said about his surroundings, which included herds of cattle with glistening coats meandering past what seemed like endless desert brush. "But we have to protect what we have to protect."\par \par \uc2 antonio.olivo@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020140902ea92000dy\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 A-Section\par {\*\bkmkstart toc58}{\*\bkmkend toc58}\b \uc2 Guardsmen adjustto new role in Texas\b0\par\par\uc2 Antonio Olivo   \par \uc2 1,900 \uc2 words\par \uc2 2 September 2014\par \uc2 The Washington Post\par \uc2 WP\par \uc2 FINAL\par A01\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2014, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved   \par \par \uc2 The National Guard troops arrived here last week, outfitted in body armor and carrying pistols to help bring more security to the U.S.-Mexico border.\par \par \uc2 Yet they saw little activity after taking their positions in portable towers and Border Patrol vehicles along the dirt roads and levees that overlooked the dense brush near the Rio Grande.\par \par \uc2 Some found themselves fighting boredom, chatting with one another about their lives back home - where their jobs were altogether different than looking out for armed traffickers - and wondering how much longer they would be posted in the unforgiving desert heat. Others killed time any way they could during taxing 12-hour shifts watching the silent riverbank.\par \par \uc2 "The music keeps me up," said one soldier listening to old-school R&B tunes who requested anonymity because, as several guardsmen explained, the soldiers were not permitted to speak to the media. "We're keeping our eyes on the brush."\par \par \uc2 The National Guard was dispatched to the border with great fanfare by Texas Gov. Rick Perry (R), who declared in July that he was forced to act because of a string of failures by the federal government in addressing drug smugglers and an influx of unaccompanied Central American minors who had flooded across the border in recent months.\par \par \uc2 As of last week, 400 guardsmen had arrived. A total of 1,000 are expected to gather in the coming weeks, concentrated in this stretch of border on Texas's southernmost tip, running through the Rio Grande Valley from Brownsville to McAllen. This region has been seen as especially vulnerable to illegal crossings.\par \par \uc2 The rollout of the troops has offered Perry a chance to strike a tough tone on illegal immigration as he ponders a run for president in 2016 - and seeks to undo the political damage from a failed 2012 run in which conservatives attacked him as soft on the issue.\par \par \uc2 In his previous run, Perry told rivals opposed to giving \uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2  children in-state college tuition that "I don't think you have a heart." Now, as he presides over his state's National Guard deployment and blasts President Obama's record on border security, Perry is positioning himself as a border hawk with views closely aligned with the core Republican voters who will play a big role in choosing the party's 2016 White House nominee.\par \par \uc2 But now that the guardsmen have arrived, their exact role, besides keeping watch on the brush, is not entirely clear.\par \par \uc2 The soldiers have undergone training in recent weeks in air and ground surveillance. During their shifts, they stand watch, usually from stations peering out over the river, or while joining Border Patrol units driving around the dusty expanses outside McAllen.\par \par \uc2 In their off hours they take in their new surroundings from the gangways of hotels with cigarettes or cold beers in hand.\par \par \uc2 These soldiers are only the latest armed force coming to a region that has been militarized for years.\par \par \uc2 Dramatic funding increases over the past decade for Border Patrol agents and other security measures long ago transformed the area into what can feel like a heavily fortified zone. Perry in June launched "Operation Strong Safety," an $18-million-per-month effort to boost the law enforcement presence near the border.\par \par \uc2 The National Guard deployment is part of that broader buildup, adding to a scene where soldiers in camouflage shuttle to and fro in unmarked but easily recognizable white vans while state police cars sit idling at nearly every highway intersection - beneath an ever-present white federal government blimp monitoring activities below.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, the number of border crossers has been on the decline in recent weeks, with the flow of unaccompanied minors slowing considerably.\par \par \uc2 The presence of additional soldiers is being greeted here with mixed emotions, with some locals appreciating the added protection and others wondering when enough is enough.\par \par \uc2 The charm of living near cattle ranches and mesquite trees that make up large portions of the Rio Grande Valley is steadily evaporating, residents say.\par \par \uc2 "It's all different. I think the United States is a police state now," said Javier Pe\u241\'00\'F1a, a former police officer in Rio Grande City who had just finished breakfast at the Texas Cafe.\par \par \uc2 Others see the National Guard troops as necessary.\par \par \uc2 "Will the border ever be secure? The answer is that it could be. But the federal government needs to get off the side, get in the game and be a real player and stop pretending," said Rio Grande City Mayor Ruben Villarreal, whose community has seen the brunt of border crossing and drug smuggling.\par \par \uc2 "When these women and children were crossing our border, it opened all of our eyes up," Villarreal said. "They're the more delicate, the more fragile in our society, and they were walking across our border like they were just going through turnstiles at a baseball game."\par \par \uc2 Officials from the Perry administration and the National Guard declined to be interviewed to discuss the soldiers' role.\par \par \uc2 Tom Vinger, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety, which is overseeing the governor's border efforts, said the goal was to "deny Mexican cartels and their associates unfettered entry into Texas between the ports of entry, as well as reduce the power of these organizations, whose success depends on their ability to operate on both sides of the border."\par \par \uc2 A statement from the agency that oversees the state's National Guard, Texas Military Forces, said the soldiers were "amplifying the visible presence on the ground and along the river" in an effort to keep the Rio Grande Valley secure.\par \par \uc2 "Specifically, the Texas National Guard is providing a variety of subject matter experts and equipment primarily involving aviation assets, logistics and ground troops to support the state-led operations along the Texas-Mexico border," the agency said.\par \par \uc2 A spokeswoman with \uc2 U.S. Customs and Border Protection\uc2 , the agency that includes Border Patrol, declined to provide details of how it is working with the National Guard, other than to say that the two agencies are cooperating.\par \par \uc2 The arrival of the Central American children and the National Guard deployment have shaken some local residents who have lived for decades with illegal crossings and smuggling over the shimmering Rio Grande.\par \par \uc2 Back when the flow of people across the river was sporadic and smuggling meant someone's neighbor moved tequila or flour back and forth across the border, it was easy to look the other way and go about your life, local residents say.\par \par \uc2 Now, the situation is far more complicated, with even the former Hidalgo County sheriff serving a five-year prison sentence after pleading guilty to money laundering and accepting campaign donations from an alleged drug trafficker.\par \par \uc2 The idea that what happens along the Rio Grande is interwoven with life in the valley's small towns and farms extends as far back as the days when Spanish colonial settlers moved goods and livestock to and from Mexico.\par \par \uc2 Ruperto Escobar's roots in the area date to 1767, when one of his ancestors arrived to claim a Spanish land grant that includes his current farm on the riverbank and the town named after his family: Escobares.\par \par \uc2 That history and the decades he spent farming his land taught him a creed repeated by others in the area about the river and illegal activity there, Escobares, 70, said in his Spanish-inflected accent: "I don't bother them, they don't bother me."\par \par \uc2 Over the years, drug traffickers and others headed north have trekked across his land, with Escobar and his workers usually trying to ignore them. Recently, he said, two men with rifles showed up near his irrigation pump, ordering Escobar's workers to clear out because there was different work to be done there that night.\par \par \uc2 He said he realized how faulty his mind-set had become when the Central American children began appearing on the riverbank, followed now by soldiers with semiautomatic pistols strapped to their fatigues - embodiments of what has become an often surreal lifestyle.\par \par \uc2 "We've been turning this eye away from it for so long that it's gotten out of control," Escobar said, adding that he welcomes the National Guard and any other border enforcement. "Now, we can't handle it. Now, we're afraid. Now, we want someone else to come in and handle it."\par \par \uc2 Others say they are assuming that responsibility.\par \par \uc2 Othal E. Brand Jr., president of Hidalgo County Water Improvement District 3, which provides much of the drinking water for the McAllen area, said he had been frustrated after the federal government built a portion of a border fence around the water district property, leaving portions of the area open to crossers and armed traffickers who often chased away his workers.\par \par \uc2 The property sits not far from a major border crossing by Anzalduas Park, where on a recent afternoon the laughter and banda music being played by a group of families splashing on the Mexican side of the river floated across the water. Last year, Brand said, eight bodies were found nearby in the river, four of them without heads.\par \par \uc2 In the past, however, the area had been hard to reach for Border Patrol agents and other law enforcement agencies. Their boats did not have easy access to the river.\par \par \uc2 About three years ago, Brand persuaded his board to spend $125,000 to build a boat ramp. Another $125,000 was used for the guard tower and bullet-proof wrapping around the water district pump, he said.\par \par \uc2 The expenditures of local funds have stirred controversy. But Brand said the water district property is now a virtual station for federal and state law enforcement officers who are grateful for the boat launch and the free bottles of water and ice Brand provides.\par \par \uc2 "Whatever we do, we've got to do as a state, as a county, as a water district," Brand said. "Forget the feds."\par \par \uc2 About 20 miles away in a rural portion of Hidalgo County, Fred and Josie Cappadona said they are eager to see more law enforcement near their cattle ranch.\par \par \uc2 The couple moved to the area during the early 1970s, shortly after Fred Cappadona, 68, returned from the Vietnam War, where he flew an assault helicopter on missions to the Cambodian border.\par \par \uc2 The silence of South Texas appealed to Cappadona, he said, a tranquility that was initially interrupted only occasionally by a random border crosser attempting to make his way north.\par \par \uc2 The degree of danger encroaching on their family recently burst into view during a birthday party the Cappadonas were holding for one of their grandchildren.\par \par \uc2 A truck traveling about 70 mph raced past a patio where the kids were playing, apparently lost as the driver sought to offload his human cargo. With his .380-caliber pistol within easy reach, Cappadona drove after the truck and asked the driver to slow down before the truck raced off through another fence, he said.\par \par \uc2 That and other encounters make the idea of living with more law enforcement in the area palatable, even if it means losing some of their tranquility, he said.\par \par \uc2 "Yeah, it's not the same," Cappadona said about his surroundings, which included herds of cattle with glistening coats meandering past what seemed like endless desert brush. "But we have to protect what we have to protect."\par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com\par \par \uc2 WP20140902texasborder0902\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020140902ea920000g\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved   \par \par \uc2 More than 140 protesters, including Maryland Del. Ana Sol Gutierrez (D-Montgomery) and dozens of labor and immigrant leaders, were arrested Thursday outside the White House while staging a sit-down rally to demand protection from deportation for millions of illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 The demonstrators, representing more than 20 organizations, said the arrests were part of a civil disobedience campaign aimed at putting pressure on President Obama to enact broad leniency for \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  families and workers as part of his announced review of U.S. immigration policies.\par \par \uc2 Organizers said several hundred demonstrators sat down in front of the White House, chanting and hanging banners and flowers on the fence. About 145 people were then peacefully handcuffed by the U.S. Park Police and taken in vans and buses to a detention facility in Anacostia.\par \par \uc2 A U.S. Park Police official said most of the protesters paid a $50 fine for holding an unlawful demonstration and were released, but some were still being processed as of 5 p.m. He said there had been no difficulties or violence.\par \par \uc2 Gustavo Torres\uc2 , executive director of the immigrant advocate group Casa of Maryland and Casa of Virginia, was one of those taken into custody. Before his arrest, he issued a statement calling on Obama to "do everything in his power to enact humane and compassionate administrative relief" that would end the "suffering of immigrant families facing separation" through deportation.\par \par \uc2 Shortly after his release at 4 p.m., Torres said he was planning to "keep up the fight to make sure the president announces a big administration relief for people. We are very committed." He said the police arrests and procedures were orderly and calm.\par \par \uc2 Other protesters who were photographed, placed in plastic handcuffs and taken into custody included \uc2 Terry O'Neill\uc2 , president of the National Organization for Women; \uc2 Larry Cohen\uc2 , president of the Communications Workers of America; and several illegal immigrants associated with Casa of Maryland and Casa of Virginia.\par \par \uc2 The protesters first gathered outside the headquarters of the \uc2 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2  agency, in Southwest Washington, and marched to the White House, where the arrests began a few minutes after a group of them sat down.\par \par \uc2 Obama has said he plans to use executive action to make major changes in immigration policy after Congress failed to reach agreement this year on proposals for comprehensive immigration reform.\par \par \uc2 He is reportedly considering a combination of measures that would grant deportation relief for certain categories of illegal immigrants and increase the number of legal immigrants by adding more visas for highly skilled workers and family members of immigrants who are permanent residents or U.S. citizens.\par \par \uc2 The Obama administration has said it is concentrating its deportation efforts on illegal immigrants who commit other crimes, but advocates such as Torres and Gutierrez say thousands of illegal immigrants who are otherwise law-abiding workers and parents have also been deported, dividing families who have been in the United States for years.\par \par \uc2 Obama previously granted deportation relief to hundreds of thousands of Latino youths who entered the country illegally as children but have maintained a clean record.\par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com\par \par \uc2 WP20140829protest29\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020140829ea8t0000n\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 More than 140 protesters, including Maryland Del. Ana Sol Gutierrez (D-Montgomery) and dozens of labor and immigrant leaders, were arrested Thursday outside the White House while staging a sit-down rally to demand protection from deportation for millions of illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 The demonstrators, representing more than 20 organizations, said the arrests were part of a civil disobedience campaign aimed at putting pressure on President Obama to enact broad leniency for \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  families and workers as part of his announced review of U.S. immigration policies.\par \par \uc2 Organizers said several hundred demonstrators sat down in front of the White House, chanting and hanging banners and flowers on the fence. About 145 people were then peacefully handcuffed by the U.S. Park Police and taken in vans and buses to a detention facility in Anacostia. A U.S. Park Police official said most of the protestors paid a $50 fine for holding an unlawful demonstration and were released, but some were still being processed as of 5 p.m. He said there had been no difficulties or violence.\par \par \uc2 Gustavo Torres\uc2 , executive director of the immigrant advocate group Casa de Maryland and Casa de Virginia, was one of those taken into custody. Before his arrest, he issued a statement calling on Obama to "do everything in his power to enact humane and compassionate administrative relief" that would end the "suffering of immigrant families facing separation" through deportation.\par \par \uc2 Shortly after his release at 4 p.m., Torres said he was planning to "keep up the fight to make sure the president announces a big administration relief for people. We are very committed." He said the police arrests and procedures were orderly and calm.\par \par \uc2 Other protesters who were photographed, placed in plastic handcuffs and taken into custody included \uc2 Terry O'Neill\uc2 , president of the National Organization for Women; \uc2 Larry Cohen\uc2 , president of the Communications Workers of America; and several illegal immigrants associated with Casa de Maryland and Virginia.\par \par \uc2 The protesters first gathered outside the headquarters of the \uc2 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2  agency, in Southwest Washington, and marched to the White House, where the arrests began a few minutes after a group of them sat down.\par \par \uc2 Obama has said he plans to use executive action to make major changes in immigration policy after Congress failed to reach agreement this year on proposals for comprehensive immigration reform.\par \par \uc2 He is reportedly considering a combination of measures that would grant deportation relief for certain categories of illegal immigrants, and that would also increase the number of legal immigrants by adding more visas for highly skilled workers and family members of immigrants who are permanent residents or U.S. citizens.\par \par \uc2 The Obama administration has said it is concentrating its deportation efforts on illegal immigrants who commit other crimes, but advocates such as Torres and Gutierrez say that thousands of illegal immigrants who are otherwise law-abiding workers and parents have also been deported, dividing families who have been in the United States for years.\par \par \uc2 Obama previously granted deportation relief to hundreds of thousands of Latino youths who entered the country illegally as children but have maintained a clean record.\par \par \uc2 pamela.constable@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020140828ea8s006y6\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 A new poll shows that Americans are pretty sympathetic when it comes to the influx of young illegal immigrants from Central America.\par \par \uc2 More than two-thirds (69 percent) say these children should be treated with the protections of refugees rather than as illegal immigrants; 56 percent say their families are doing what they can to protect their children rather\u160\'00\'A0than taking advantage of Americans; and 70 percent say the children\u160\'00\'A0should be offered shelter and support, according to the Public Religion Research Institute poll. Just 26 percent of Americans say\u160\'00\'A0the children should be deported immediately.\par \par \uc2 But even as Americans view these \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  children in this positive light, something else has happened: Their overall views of immigrants have taken a turn for the worse.\par \par \uc2 I wrote last month\u160\'00\'A0about how perceptions of immigrants in the United States -- both legal and illegal --\u160\'00\'A0had been gradually improving for decades. And that has certainly been the case.\par \par \uc2 Here's how that looked, from \uc2 New York Times\uc2  polling:\par \par \uc2 And from NBC/Wall Street Journal polling:\par \par \uc2 Well, as the situation on the border has deteriorated, so have Americans' views of immigrants.\par \par \uc2 According to the PRRI poll, fewer than half of Americans\u160\'00\'A0(49 percent) now say immigrants "strengthen" the United States with their "hard work and talents." Forty-two percent now say they are a "burden" because they are a drain on jobs, housing and health care.\par \par \uc2 Less than three months ago, that mere seven-points split was as much as 32 points.\par \par \uc2 The double-digit\u160\'00\'A0drop in the percentage of Americans who view immigrants writ large as strengthening the United States is the biggest we've seen in recent years.\par \par \uc2 The question is whether this is part of a new normal or merely a momentary reaction to what has become a pretty serious situation on the border. It's quite possible it's the latter, given Americans are more likely to view immigrants today in the context of what's happening on the border, rather than in the context of legal immigration. That could explain the recent shift.\par \par \uc2 But if it's the former and it sticks, that spells bad things for the prospects of comprehensive immigration reform going forward.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020140827ea8r004ph\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 When Ahmed Abassi arrived in the United States for the first time in March 2013, the Tunisian student settled into a historic, neo-Gothic apartment building in Manhattan's Financial District.\par \par \uc2 Unknown to him, the apartment was wired with audio recording devices, and Abassi's American host was an undercover FBI agent. Abassi, then 26 and suspected of terrorism ties, had landed in an \uc2 FBI\uc2  sting, part of an elaborate operation that stretched from New York to Quebec City to a small town in Tunisia.\par \par \uc2 Abassi was caught on tape discussing "the principle that America should be wiped off the face of the earth," with people he believed to be co-conspirators, one of whom was the FBI agent, according to court records. At one point, Abassi suggested "putting bacteria in the air or in a water supply."\par \par \uc2 But last month, Abassi, who declined to be interviewed, pleaded guilty to relatively minor charges that did not include any terrorism enhancements that could have sent him to prison for years, and he is not contesting a deportation order.\par \par \uc2 The case was a rare setback for the \uc2 FBI\uc2  and federal prosecutors, which have successfully targeted suspected terrorists using sting operations, typically ending with the defendants about to embark on what they believe is a terrorist attack with fake weapons or bombs supplied by the bureau. Guilty verdicts and long prison sentences follow.\par \par \uc2 According to a recent report by \uc2 Human Rights Watch\uc2 , nearly 50 percent of the more than 500 federal counterterrorism convictions since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks have "resulted from informant-based cases; almost 30 percent of those cases were sting operations in which the informant played an active role in the underlying plot."\par \par \uc2 Among the more prominent prosecutions, a Moroccan man was convicted for planning a suicide bombing at the Capitol. Amine Mohamed El Khalifi, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who lived in Alexandria, was arrested wearing a suicide vest that he believed to be real and had been provided by undercover \uc2 FBI\uc2  agents. In Portland, a Somali-American was convicted of planning to remotely detonate an 1,800 pound bomb at a Christmas tree lighting ceremony. The device was, in fact, inert and had been supplied by the bureau. In one 2009 case, the \uc2 FBI\uc2  arrested a group of men in New York state \u8212\'20\'14 the "Newburgh Four" \u8212\'20\'14 and charged them with plotting to blow up a pair of synagogues in the Bronx with fake bombs provided by an informant.\par \par \uc2 Human rights groups allege that the government is making terrorists out of people who otherwise would not have the ability or the will to move forward with an attack. "The government pursues people with mental or intellectual disabilities or people who are desperately poor with an aggressive informant or undercover agent to get them to agree to commit terrorist acts," said \uc2 Andrea Prasow\uc2 , deputy director of Human Rights Watch's Washington office.\par \par \uc2 And the use of sting operations has also drawn some criticism from the bench. In the Newburgh case, the federal judge said the government "made them terrorists" and said the "buffoonery" of one of the defendants was "positively Shakespearean in scope."\par \par \uc2 But no defendant, including in the Newburgh case, has successfully claimed in court that he was entrapped by overzealous investigators.\par \par \uc2 At a recent security forum in Aspen, Colo., former FBI director \uc2 Robert Mueller\uc2  defended the bureau's tactics against charges of entrapment. Mueller said agents and prosecutors go to great lengths to make sure they do not cross that line.\par \par \uc2 "We know at the outset that anytime we do this that the defense is going to be entrapment and there has to be substantial predication to get over that hurdle," he said. "It's been the defense in probably dozens of terrorism cases that have been tried since Sept. 11. And I challenge you to find one of those cases in which the defendant has been acquitted asserting that defense. I don't believe there is one out there."\par \par \uc2 Abassi was arrested last year and charged with two counts of fraud and misuse of visas to facilitate an act of international terrorism. Federal prosectuors in the Southern District of New York withdrew the terrorism enhancements against Abassi before they could be adjudicated, and some activists said an entrapment defense might have tested the government's winning record.\par \par \uc2 An FBI spokesman in New York declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 Abassi was more talker than terrorist and resisted attempts to move beyond words to direct action, according to his attorney, Sabrina P. Shroff, a federal public defender. She described the case against her client as a failed entrapment in which the government attempted to prey on Abassi's "bad thoughts and bad speech."\par \par \uc2 Fateful meeting\par \par \uc2 Abassi first came to the attention of the \uc2 FBI\uc2  in Canada, where he was studying for an engineering degree at \uc2 Laval University\uc2  in Quebec City, according to court records. His family said his sister followed him to Canada, where he also met and married a Tunisian woman.\par \par \uc2 Among Abassi's new circle of friends was Chiheb Esseghaier, a doctoral student. The \uc2 FBI\uc2  and Canadian authorities began to suspect that Esseghaier and Abassi were part of a terrorist cell, according to court records.\par \par \uc2 Esseghaier introduced Abassi to a man from New York, Tamer El Noury, who said he was born in Egypt and had immigrated to the United States when he was a child. He looked like one of Abassi's favorite performers, a Syrian singer named George Wassouf. The two got along famously. When in Quebec, Noury came to Abassi's house to eat.\par \par \uc2 Neither Abassi nor his wife, Yousra, ever suspected that Noury was an FBI agent.\par \par \uc2 "We had no idea," his wife said in an interview.\par \par \uc2 The New Yorker appeared wealthy and said he ran a successful real estate company in the city. As a wedding gift, he said he would pay for Abassi and Yousra to visit Manhattan, she said.\par \par \uc2 Abassi declined the invitation, and instead he and his wife flew to Tunisia in December 2012 to renew their wedding vows. "We danced, we invited all our relatives and friends and we enjoyed together," his wife said.\par \par \uc2 The euphoria didn't last. That month, the Canadians revoked Abassi's visa without explanation. Officials decided to test Abassi's willingness to conduct an act of terrorism.\par \par \uc2 Noury began what Abassi's attorney described as an aggressive campaign to get her client to come to New York from Tunisia. Cut off from his wife, who was able to return to Canada to finish her education, Abassi seemed determined to secure a new visa so he could return to her side. He wanted to finish his master's degree, and he had a job offer with a major mining company. But no Canadian visa was forthcoming.\par \par \uc2 Noury called Abassi's wife in February 2013.\par \par \uc2 "We can get him in New York where he can stay with me in the apartment, or he will have his own apartment, and if, God willing, you can take some time off from work, we can bring you here to stay with him so that you can spend some time together," said Noury, according to a transcript of the call.\par \par \uc2 Abassi agreed to fly to New York after U.S. law enforcement arranged a visa for the "sole purpose of advancing the investigation," according to court records.\par \par \uc2 Move to New York\par \par \uc2 In March 2013, Abassi flew to John F. Kennedy International Airport, where he was briefly questioned by immigration authorities. Noury met him at the airport.\par \par \uc2 The two drove to the downtown apartment, where the call to prayer sounded electronically five times a day to highlight Noury's piety. The undercover agent provided Abassi with a cellphone and laptop. The rent was free.\par \par \uc2 An unexpected visitor soon arrived: Esseghaier, who said he was attending a scientific conference in New York.\par \par \uc2 The three men met frequently. Authorities say Esseghaier told Abassi about his plans for a terrorist attack. But Abassi did not want any part of them, frustrating the conspirator, who urged Noury to throw him out of the apartment. Esseghaier called Abassi "useless" and not a "true brother."\par \par \uc2 Abassi continued to make inflammatory statements, however. He argued that the Koran allowed "Muslims to attack Americans in the same ways Americans had attacked Muslims, including the killing of women and children," according to court records.\par \par \uc2 On April 22, 2013, Abassi was questioned by the \uc2 FBI\uc2 . Prosecutors said he lied repeatedly about his relationship with Esseghaier and whether he knew the Tunisian planned to engage in terrorism. The \uc2 FBI\uc2  arrested Abassi. That same day, Canadian authorities took Esseghaier and another man into custody, charging them with conspiracy to attack an \uc2 Amtrak\uc2  train traveling from New York to Toronto.\par \par \uc2 U.S. prosecutors said Abassi acknowledged possibly radicalizing Esseghaier, and that the two had talked about committing terrorist acts, according to court records. They said Abassi did not want to participate in Esseghaier's plans only because "the number of American casualties from such an operation would be too few."\par \par \uc2 Shroff said her client did not radicalize Esseghaier.\par \par \uc2 "If you actually listen to the conversations between Chiheb [Esseghaier] and Ahmed, you'll realize Ahmed is talking about words and verses from the Koran," his attorney said. "He's telling Chiheb what's in the Koran. That is not radicalizing."\par \par \uc2 Authorities also said the men had received guidance from members of \uc2 al-Qaeda\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 A U.S. law enforcement official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive details of the case, said the \uc2 FBI\uc2  had to end the U.S. operation against Abassi prematurely because the Canadians were concerned about the threat Esseghaier posed and arrested him.\par \par \uc2 The official said more will come out about the men, including Abassi, when Esseghaier goes on trial in Canada. The official said the men were part of a cell and presented a serious threat, one the \uc2 FBI\uc2  helped eliminate.\par \par \uc2 "It was a good case," the official said.\par \par \uc2 Abassi spent months in jail, part of that time in a segregated housing unit, before his attorney received transcripts of the \uc2 FBI\uc2  recordings. Shroff said it was apparent to her that Abassi had not provided the evidence the \uc2 FBI\uc2  needed to make its case, that he had not stepped over the line into active participation in a plot.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors seemed to reach a similar conclusion. They told Shroff they would drop the terrorism enhancements if Abassi agreed to plead guilty to the charges that included putting false information on an application for a green card \u8212\'20\'14 the same one the undercover agent helped him complete \u8212\'20\'14 and making a false statement to immigration officials.\par \par \uc2 "Mr. Abassi would not be asked at the time of the plea, if he accepted this offer, to in any way admit that either of these crimes touched on a crime of international terrorism," Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Ferrara told the judge during a hearing in April.\par \par \uc2 Ferrara would not discuss the case, but another U.S. law enforcement official said there were considerations if the case went to trial, including revealing the true identity of the \uc2 FBI\uc2  undercover agent.\par \par \uc2 "There were strategic discussions," the official said. "We had a good undercover who would then be exposed. Was it worth it to get a couple of extra years in prison? It's not clear the judge would have given him more time."\par \par \uc2 The official added that Abassi pleaded guilty to a felony and "will never again be in the U.S. That's much better than letting him float around out there and never be charged at all."\par \par \uc2 For Shroff, the reason prosecutors backed off is clear: "He was entrapped," she said.\par \par \uc2 At sentencing, prosecutors called for a longer prison term than the six months suggested by the guidelines, arguing that Abassi was far more dangerous than "simply an immigration fraudster" and had "dangerous, extremist views."\par \par \uc2 In a phone interview, his sister Amira Abassi said: "My brother is not a monster. That is the reality. He is not evil."\par \par \uc2 On July 16, Judge Miriam Cedarbaum waved away government calls for a stern sentence. The 84-year-old judge told Abassi to stay clear of trouble.\par \par \uc2 "I hope that you will think very seriously about the events of the last year and will decide to always abide by the laws of the United States," she said. "And if you do that, I wish you good luck."\par \par \uc2 Abassi is being held in an immigration detention facility in New Jersey, where he awaits deportation to Tunisia.\par \par \uc2 adam.goldman@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020140814ea8e007y7\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved   \par \par \uc2 When Ahmed Abassi arrived in the United States for the first time in March 2013, the Tunisian student settled into a historic, neo-Gothic apartment building in Manhattan's Financial District.\par \par \uc2 Unknown to him, the apartment was wired with audio recording devices, and Abassi's American host was an undercover FBI agent. Abassi, then 26 and suspected of terrorism ties, had landed in an \uc2 FBI\uc2  sting, part of an elaborate operation that stretched from New York to Quebec City to a small town in Tunisia.\par \par \uc2 Abassi was caught on tape discussing "the principle that America should be wiped off the face of the earth" with people he believed to be co-conspirators, one of whom was the FBI agent, according to court records. At one point, Abassi suggested "putting bacteria in the air or in a water supply."\par \par \uc2 But last month, Abassi, who declined to be interviewed, pleaded guilty to relatively minor charges that did not include any terrorism enhancements that could have sent him to prison for years, and he is not contesting a deportation order.\par \par \uc2 The case was a rare setback for the \uc2 FBI\uc2  and federal prosecutors, which have successfully targeted suspected terrorists using sting operations, typically ending with the defendants about to embark on what they believe is a terrorist attack with fake weapons or bombs supplied by the bureau. Guilty verdicts and long prison sentences follow.\par \par \uc2 According to a recent report by \uc2 Human Rights Watch\uc2 , nearly 50 percent of the more than 500 federal counterterrorism convictions since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks have "resulted from informant-based cases; almost 30 percent of those cases were sting operations in which the informant played an active role in the underlying plot."\par \par \uc2 Among the more prominent prosecutions, a Moroccan man was convicted for planning a suicide bombing at the Capitol. Amine Mohamed El Khalifi, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who lived in Alexandria, Va., was arrested wearing a suicide vest that he believed to be real and had been provided by undercover \uc2 FBI\uc2  agents. In Portland, Ore., a Somali American was convicted of planning to remotely detonate an 1,800-pound bomb at a Christmas tree lighting ceremony. The device was, in fact, inert and had been supplied by the bureau. In one 2009 case, the \uc2 FBI\uc2  arrested a group of men in New York state - the "Newburgh Four" - and charged them with plotting to blow up a pair of synagogues in the Bronx with fake bombs provided by an informant.\par \par \uc2 Human rights groups allege that the government is making terrorists out of people who otherwise would not have the ability or the will to move forward with an attack. "The government pursues people with mental or intellectual disabilities or people who are desperately poor with an aggressive informant or undercover agent to get them to agree to commit terrorist acts," said \uc2 Andrea Prasow\uc2 , deputy director of Human Rights Watch's Washington office.\par \par \uc2 And the use of sting operations has also drawn criticism from the bench. In the Newburgh case, the federal judge said the government "made them terrorists" and said the "buffoonery" of one of the defendants was "positively Shakespearean in scope."\par \par \uc2 But no defendant, including in the Newburgh case, has successfully claimed in court that he was entrapped by overzealous investigators.\par \par \uc2 At a recent security forum in Aspen, Colo., former FBI director \uc2 Robert S. Mueller III\uc2  defended the bureau's tactics against charges of entrapment. Mueller said agents and prosecutors go to great lengths to make sure they do not cross that line.\par \par \uc2 "We know at the outset that anytime we do this that the defense is going to be entrapment and there has to be substantial predication to get over that hurdle," he said. "It's been the defense in probably dozens of terrorism cases that have been tried since Sept. 11. And I challenge you to find one of those cases in which the defendant has been acquitted asserting that defense. I don't believe there is one out there."\par \par \uc2 Abassi was arrested last year and charged with two counts of fraud and misuse of visas to facilitate an act of international terrorism. Federal prosectuors in the Southern District of New York withdrew the terrorism enhancements against Abassi before they could be adjudicated, and some activists said an entrapment defense might have tested the government's winning record.\par \par \uc2 An FBI spokesman in New York declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 Abassi was more talker than terrorist and resisted attempts to move beyond words to direct action, according to his attorney, Sabrina P. Shroff, a federal public defender. She described the case against her client as a failed entrapment in which the government attempted to prey on Abassi's "bad thoughts and bad speech."\par \par \uc2 Abassi first came to the attention of the \uc2 FBI\uc2  in Canada, where he was studying for an engineering degree at \uc2 Laval University\uc2  in Quebec City, according to court records. His family said his sister followed him to Canada, where he also met and married a Tunisian woman.\par \par \uc2 Among Abassi's new circle of friends was Chiheb Esseghaier, a doctoral student. The \uc2 FBI\uc2  and Canadian authorities began to suspect that Esseghaier and Abassi were part of a terrorist cell, according to court records.\par \par \uc2 Esseghaier introduced Abassi to a man from New York, Tamer El Noury, who said he was born in Egypt and had immigrated to the United States when he was a child. He looked like one of Abassi's favorite performers, a Syrian singer named George Wassouf. The two got along famously. When in Quebec, Noury came to Abassi's house to eat.\par \par \uc2 Neither Abassi nor his wife, Yousra, ever suspected that Noury was an FBI agent.\par \par \uc2 "We had no idea," his wife said in an interview.\par \par \uc2 The New Yorker appeared wealthy and said he ran a successful real estate company in the city. As a wedding gift, he said he would pay for Abassi and Yousra to visit Manhattan, she said.\par \par \uc2 Abassi declined the invitation, and instead he and his wife flew to Tunisia in December 2012 to renew their wedding vows. "We danced, we invited all our relatives and friends and we enjoyed together," his wife said.\par \par \uc2 The euphoria didn't last. That month, the Canadians revoked Abassi's visa without explanation. Officials decided to test Abassi's willingness to conduct an act of terrorism.\par \par \uc2 Noury began what Abassi's attorney described as an aggressive campaign to get her client to come to New York from Tunisia. Cut off from his wife, who was able to return to Canada to finish her education, Abassi seemed determined to secure a new visa so he could return to her side. He wanted to finish his master's degree, and he had a job offer with a major mining company. But no Canadian visa was forthcoming.\par \par \uc2 Noury called Abassi's wife in February 2013.\par \par \uc2 "We can get him in New York where he can stay with me in the apartment, or he will have his own apartment, and if, God willing, you can take some time off from work, we can bring you here to stay with him so that you can spend some time together," said Noury, according to a transcript of the call.\par \par \uc2 Abassi agreed to fly to New York after U.S. law enforcement arranged a visa for the "sole purpose of advancing the investigation," according to court records.\par \par \uc2 In March 2013, Abassi flew to John F. Kennedy International Airport, where he was briefly questioned by immigration authorities. Noury met him at the airport.\par \par \uc2 The two drove to the downtown apartment, where the call to prayer sounded electronically five times a day to highlight Noury's piety. The undercover agent provided Abassi with a cellphone and laptop. The rent was free.\par \par \uc2 An unexpected visitor soon arrived: Esseghaier, who said he was attending a scientific conference in New York.\par \par \uc2 The three men met frequently. Authorities say Esseghaier told Abassi about his plans for a terrorist attack. But Abassi did not want any part of them, frustrating the conspirator, who urged Noury to throw him out of the apartment. Esseghaier called Abassi "useless" and not a "true brother."\par \par \uc2 Abassi continued to make inflammatory statements, however. He argued that the Koran allowed "Muslims to attack Americans in the same ways Americans had attacked Muslims, including the killing of women and children," according to court records.\par \par \uc2 On April 22, 2013, Abassi was questioned by the \uc2 FBI\uc2 . Prosecutors said he lied repeatedly about his relationship with Esseghaier and whether he knew the Tunisian planned to engage in terrorism. The \uc2 FBI\uc2  arrested Abassi. That same day, Canadian authorities took Esseghaier and another man into custody, charging them with conspiracy to attack an \uc2 Amtrak\uc2  train traveling from New York to Toronto.\par \par \uc2 U.S. prosecutors said Abassi acknowledged possibly radicalizing Esseghaier, and that the two had talked about committing terrorist acts, according to court records. They said Abassi did not want to participate in Esseghaier's plans only because "the number of American casualties from such an operation would be too few."\par \par \uc2 Shroff said her client did not radicalize Esseghaier.\par \par \uc2 "If you actually listen to the conversations between Chiheb [Esseghaier] and Ahmed, you'll realize Ahmed is talking about words and verses from the Koran," his attorney said. "He's telling Chiheb what's in the Koran. That is not radicalizing."\par \par \uc2 Authorities also said the men had received guidance from members of \uc2 al-Qaeda\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 A U.S. law enforcement official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive details of the case, said the \uc2 FBI\uc2  had to end the U.S. operation against Abassi prematurely because the Canadians were concerned about the threat Esseghaier posed and arrested him.\par \par \uc2 The official said more will come out about the men, including Abassi, when Esseghaier goes on trial in Canada. The official said the men were part of a cell and presented a serious threat, one the \uc2 FBI\uc2  helped eliminate.\par \par \uc2 "It was a good case," the official said.\par \par \uc2 Abassi spent months in jail, part of that time in a segregated housing unit, before his attorney received transcripts of the \uc2 FBI\uc2  recordings. Shroff said it was apparent to her that Abassi had not provided the evidence the \uc2 FBI\uc2  needed to make its case, that he had not stepped over the line into active participation in a plot.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors seemed to reach a similar conclusion. They told Shroff they would drop the terrorism enhancements if Abassi agreed to plead guilty to the charges that included putting false information on an application for a green card - the same one the undercover agent helped him complete - and making a false statement to immigration officials.\par \par \uc2 "Mr. Abassi would not be asked at the time of the plea, if he accepted this offer, to in any way admit that either of these crimes touched on a crime of international terrorism," Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Ferrara told the judge during a hearing in April.\par \par \uc2 Ferrara would not discuss the case, but another U.S. law enforcement official said there were considerations if the case went to trial, including revealing the true identity of the \uc2 FBI\uc2  undercover agent.\par \par \uc2 "There were strategic discussions," the official said. "We had a good undercover who would then be exposed. Was it worth it to get a couple of extra years in prison? It's not clear the judge would have given him more time."\par \par \uc2 The official added that Abassi pleaded guilty to a felony and "will never again be in the U.S. That's much better than letting him float around out there and never be charged at all."\par \par \uc2 For Shroff, the reason prosecutors backed off is clear: "He was entrapped," she said.\par \par \uc2 At sentencing, prosecutors called for a longer prison term than the six months suggested by the guidelines, arguing that Abassi was far more dangerous than "simply an immigration fraudster" and had "dangerous, extremist views."\par \par \uc2 In a phone interview, his sister Amira Abassi said: "My brother is not a monster. That is the reality. He is not evil."\par \par \uc2 On July 16, Judge Miriam Cedarbaum waved away government calls for a stern sentence. The 84-year-old judge told Abassi to stay clear of trouble.\par \par \uc2 "I hope that you will think very seriously about the events of the last year and will decide to always abide by the laws of the United States," she said. "And if you do that, I wish you good luck."\par \par \uc2 Abassi is being held in an immigration detention facility in New Jersey, where he awaits deportation to Tunisia.\par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com\par \par \uc2 WP20140815FBI0815\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020140815ea8f0001i\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 A new poll shows that Americans are pretty sympathetic when it comes to the influx of young illegal immigrants from Central America.\par \par \uc2 More than two-thirds (69 percent) say these children should be treated with the protections of refugees rather than as illegal immigrants; 56 percent say their families are doing what they can to protect their children rather\u160\'00\'A0than taking advantage of Americans; and 70 percent say the children\u160\'00\'A0should be offered shelter and support, according to the Public Religion Research Institute poll. Just 26 percent of Americans say\u160\'00\'A0the children should be deported immediately.\par \par \uc2 But even as Americans view these \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  children in this positive light, something else has happened: Their overall views of immigrants have taken a turn for the worse.\par \par \uc2 I wrote last month\u160\'00\'A0about how perceptions of immigrants in the United States -- both legal and illegal --\u160\'00\'A0had been gradually improving for decades. And that has certainly been the case.\par \par \uc2 Here's how that looked, from \uc2 New York Times\uc2  polling:\par \par \uc2 And from NBC/Wall Street Journal polling:\par \par \uc2 Well, as the situation on the border has deteriorated, so have Americans' views of immigrants.\par \par \uc2 According to the PRRI poll, fewer than half of Americans\u160\'00\'A0(49 percent) now say immigrants "strengthen" the United States with their "hard work and talents." Forty-two percent now say they are a "burden" because they are a drain on jobs, housing and health care.\par \par \uc2 Less than three months ago, that mere seven-points split was as much as 32 points.\par \par \uc2 The double-digit\u160\'00\'A0drop in the percentage of Americans who view immigrants writ large as strengthening the United States is the biggest we've seen in recent years.\par \par \uc2 The question is whether this is part of a new normal or merely a momentary reaction to what has become a pretty serious situation on the border. It's quite possible it's the latter, given Americans are more likely to view immigrants today in the context of what's happening on the border, rather than in the context of legal immigration. That could explain the recent shift.\par \par \uc2 But if it's the former and it sticks, that spells bad things for the prospects of comprehensive immigration reform going forward.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020140729ea7t0053d\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved   \par \par \uc2 Shame on the Obama administration for unfairly accusing Maryland Gov. \uc2 Martin O'Malley\uc2  of hypocrisy over immigration.\par \par \uc2 O'Malley (D) deserves applause and support, not misleading White House leaks, for urging Americans to provide decent temporary housing for the tens of thousands of young migrants who have fled violence and poverty in Central America.\par \par \uc2 The governor still has to deliver, of course. He needs to follow through on his stated desire for Maryland to do its part by placing hundreds of the youths in foster care or other accommodations in the state.\par \par \uc2 But indications are that O'Malley is genuinely committed to doing the right thing. His humanitarian appeal has contrasted starkly with Obama's emphasis on speeding up deportations of the youths, even at risk of trampling their legal rights to asylum.\par \par \uc2 O'Malley was smeared by an anonymously sourced \uc2 CNN\uc2  report last week that clearly originated in the White House. It noted that O'Malley had resisted placing youths in a vacant military facility in Westminster, northwest of Baltimore.\par \par \uc2 The implication was clear: O'Malley talks big but won't deliver if his own back yard is affected.\par \par \uc2 It was a bum rap.\par \par \uc2 O'Malley had good reasons for opposing the Westminster site. He has been actively exploring how Maryland could pull its weight to help the migrants elsewhere.\par \par \uc2 The governor even has offered a number for how many youths he's prepared to shelter. O'Malley told Maryland religious leaders at a private meeting in Annapolis on Monday that if the United States ultimately has to house 100,000 youths, Maryland should be willing to care for 1,880 of them, according to participants.\par \par \uc2 An O'Malley aide wouldn't say how the governor arrived at that figure, but it is proportional to Maryland's fraction of the total U.S. population. The aide also said the number could be less than 1,880 because Maryland and other states would be responsible only for migrants whom federal facilities couldn't handle.\par \par \uc2 O'Malley isn't saying all the children necessarily would remain permanently in the United States. He just wants to be sure they aren't railroaded out of the country before they've had a proper chance to apply for legal asylum.\par \par \uc2 Many of the youths have suffered from violence, persecution or other wrongdoing at the hands of Honduran, Salvadoran and Guatemalan gangs that could qualify them for protection under U.S. laws.\par \par \uc2 "These children who have fled this violence are entitled to due process," O'Malley said in the remarks that infuriated the White House. "I believe it's against everything we stand for as a people to try to summarily send children back to death."\par \par \uc2 Former congressman Mike Barnes (D-Md.), who has advised O'Malley on immigration issues, said the White House had to know that O'Malley was ready to step up.\par \par \uc2 "He had already been talking to me and others, asking, 'How do we help here?' " said Barnes, a senior fellow at the \uc2 Center for International Policy\uc2 . "It's impossible that they got the impression he was saying Maryland wouldn't help."\par \par \uc2 O'Malley didn't want youths placed in the Westminster center partly because the building is located in anti-\uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2  Carroll County, which last year formally made English its official language.\par \par \uc2 In addition, O'Malley agrees with many experts that it's undesirable to house the young migrants in large, barracks-like facilities.\par \par \uc2 Instead, he would place them with family members, if possible, or in foster care.\par \par \uc2 O'Malley called the meeting Monday with a diverse group of 50 faith leaders to seek their support in aiding migrant children. The response was enthusiastic.\par \par \uc2 "The president might seem to say . . . we should send all these youngsters back, [but] the common theme [at the meeting] was, 'No, that's not right,' " said Monsignor John J. Enzler, chief executive of Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of Washington.\par \par \uc2 "This is not a time to be debating borders and who should be here," Enzler said. "You have children who need to be taken care of."\par \par \uc2 He and other leaders said they were ready to recruit families to be foster parents or provide other services for the youths.\par \par \uc2 "Let's not expect that all the burden should be on Texas, Arizona and New Mexico," said the Right Rev. Eugene Taylor Sutton, Episcopal bishop of Maryland.\par \par \uc2 If O'Malley and Maryland ultimately balk at contributing as promised, then the accusation of hypocrisy will be justified. So far, however, the governor gets credit for taking a principled stand.\par \par \uc2 I discuss local issues Friday at 8:50 a.m. on WAMU (88.5 FM).

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 I like "The Bridge," FX's show about an El Paso detective, Sonya Cross (Diane Kruger), who ends up partnered with Marco Ruiz (Demian Bichir), a Mexican cop from a corrupt department. But when the show, which conducts many scenes in Spanish and has a sometimes-keen sense of border politics, returned last week, I found myself thinking of "The Bridge" as a cautionary example of what can happen when a show tries to be topical.\par \par \uc2 In trying to capture the more dramatic crimes that can happen on a fluid border between two countries, "The Bridge" has been overtaken by the evolving immigration debate.\par \par \uc2 "The Bridge" is one of a number of dramas that might be more properly called horror series. Showrunner Elwood Reid and the directors he collaborates with have an eye for the eerie: a skeletal Madonna in the desert, a blank-faced lawyer in a 10-gallon hat carefully tucking his pants into his boots as he ventures into a new house that has been splattered with blood, the fascination\u160\'00\'A0in\u160\'00\'A0Cross's eyes as she watches beetles clean a small skull.\par \par \uc2 Knowing how to turn out such images is not the same thing as knowing how to parcel them out for maximum impact and when to deploy them.\u160\'00\'A0In the second season of the show, the baroque criminality taking place on both sides of the border in "The Bridge" feels a bit like the new normal. When the news that\u160\'00\'A0a Mexican drug lord put in an order to have a dead Drug Enforcement Administration agent taxidermied fails to shock, a show has calibrated something wrong.\par \par \uc2 Against all of this, though, "The Bridge" still excels at generating outstanding moments of human interaction.\par \par \uc2 It is both funny and tremendously sad to watch Sonya awkwardly seduce the man whose brother murdered her sister, the sex that follows more a purge of grief for their ruined lives than an expression of lust. Daniel Frye, the addict and reporter played with tremendous verve by Matthew Lillard, and his lesbian Mexican partner, Adriana Mendez (Emily Rios), remain one of the most compelling duos on television, whether Frye is arguing with his \uc2 Alcoholics Anonymous\uc2  sponsor over the comparative merits of the band Rush or crashing Adriana's dates.\par \par \uc2 The imbalance between these two strengths on "The Bridge" feels particularly strong because of what is actually going on at the border right now. The menace of someone like cartel boss Fausto Galvan (Ram\u243\'00\'F3n Franco) seems a little silly and over-the-top in contrast to the factors driving unaccompanied children north in numbers that have produced a humanitarian and political crisis.\par \par \uc2 "Gang violence in Central America, especially in Honduras and El Salvador, is driving a substantial exodus to other countries throughout the region," explained Vox's Dara Lind. "In particular, teenagers in these countries are being recruited to join gangs; if they refuse, the gang will often retaliate against them and their families."\par \par \uc2 Lind reports that the children who are getting caught at the border are getting younger by the year, and more of them are female.\par \par \uc2 The prospect of parents sending their children on alone or of children making long journeys to reunite with their parents presents terrible tradeoffs. Is it worth risking sexual assault or other violence on the road to avoid being impressed into a gang?\u160\'00\'A0The idea that more than 50,000 children, traveling without their parents, have been apprehended trying to get into the United States so far this year, does not need the splashy addition of a serial killer or a cartel leader to be horrifying.\par \par \uc2 "The Bridge" can tell this kind of story, when it wants to.\par \par \uc2 I can taste the bile when\u160\'00\'A0raw terror rises in Maria's (Karen Sours) throat\u160\'00\'A0even after the horrors she experienced as an undocumented immigrant were supposed to be over. The disappearance last season of Adriana's sister,\u160\'00\'A0who works in a maquiladora, was as frightening as any of the more conventional horror scenes in "The Bridge." Its characters are experiencing the large and small cultural transitions of the present moment in immigration policy, as when Marco corrects Sonya when she refers to an "\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 " rather than an "undocumented" person.\par \par \uc2 Unfortunately, "The Bridge" tries so hard to shock us into awareness that it forgets there are other, more humane ways to appeal to our senses. Maybe the show is following the logic of Washington, reasoning that our sense of fear is stronger than our feelings of compassion. If so, it is a depressing illustration of how static the dynamic of immigration enforcement and reform has become that even art does not trust itself to move us.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020140717ea7h005v8\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 President Obama seems poised to act on immigration, with or without the help of \uc2 Congress\uc2 . Last week, he\u160\'00\'A0announced that he's "beginning a new effort to fix as much of our immigration system as I can on my own, without \uc2 Congress\uc2 ." Critics have decried this very pledge as illegal. But there are legal executive actions he can take to improve our dysfunctional immigration system now.\par \par \uc2 Granted, without \uc2 Congress\uc2 , Obama's options are limited. Like making small repairs on a totaled vehicle, he's left tinkering around the edges of a broken system so long as \uc2 Congress\uc2  remains deadlocked. Still, even relatively small fixes could improve the lot of millions of immigrants and smooth out some of the rough patches in our overly restrictive system.\par \par \uc2 For example, Obama could allow some illegal\u160\'00\'A0immigrants to apply for green cards through the current immigration system. Currently, unlawful immigrants can't earn a green card because, in order to apply, they have to leave the country. This then triggers a legal catch-22 that bars them from re-entering.\par \par \uc2 The president could institute a "parole in place" for unlawful immigrants who are minors, parents or spouses of U.S. citizens \u8212\'20\'14 people who are otherwise eligible for green cards \u8212\'20\'14 and allow them to apply for green cards without leaving the country.\u160\'00\'A0Stuart Anderson of the National Foundation for American Policy estimates that this reform could legalize 3.5 to 5 million current unauthorized immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Obama could also pressure federal agencies to repeal the onerous regulations they've created that stymie current guest worker visas for lower-skilled immigrants. These administrative rules go beyond what the law requires.\par \par \uc2 For instance, regulations enacted in 2010 significantly raised the costs for farmers to employ guest workers.\u160\'00\'A0The agricultural guest worker visa is theoretically has no cap, but complex regulations imposed by four different federal agencies have stymied the system so much that only 74,192 visas were issued in 2013.\u160\'00\'A0According to a special survey conducted in 2011, 59 percent\u160\'00\'A0of farmers in Georgia said that the program was too costly, too bureaucratically complex, and unworkable.\par \par \uc2 One farmer\u160\'00\'A0complained\u160\'00\'A0that after his wife spent two months filling out the application for guest workers, the government changed the wage rate. Instead of simply amending their application, the farmer said, "we had to start over, and to top it off, our workers were late."\par \par \uc2 Recognizing the burden this placed on both farmers and immigrants, the \uc2 Georgia Department of Agriculture\uc2  suggested creating a new government program to help farmers apply for agricultural guest workers. Instead, Obama should relieve this bureaucratic burden unilaterally by pressing the Department of Labor to streamline and deregulate the program as much as possible. This would decrease demand for unauthorized immigrant workers and relieve the pressure to immigrate illegally.\u160\'00\'A0When the government reformed agricultural guest worker visas in the 1950s, the unauthorized immigrant population dropped by over 90 percent because they were channeled into the legal system and new migrants were able to come legally.\par \par \uc2 It's not just agriculture. Employers in some seasonal hospitality and service sector jobs have access to 66,000. For the H-2B visa, the Department of Labor shortened the work period from 11 months in 2009 to 10 months in 2012 and required the employer to be financially responsible for all inbound and outbound travel to the United States.\par \par \uc2 Such rules decrease the incentive to hire lawful guest workers and thus exacerbate the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  worker problem. The good news is that \uc2 Congress\uc2  has not mandated it to be this way. Obama can easily pressure federal agencies to reverse or loosen these obstructive administrative regulations and escape accusations from Republicans that he is exceeding his authority.\par \par \uc2 Most of the public debate over immigration reform centers on the 11 to 12 million unauthorized immigrants who are already here. Solving this mess requires long-term solutions that channel immigrants into the legal immigration system, instead of providing incentives for them to come illegally.\par \par \uc2 But with a \uc2 Congress\uc2  that's afraid to tackle immigration reform, the President is left to take practical, and legal, steps in the meantime to improve the system as it currently exists.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020140709ea79000jj\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 President Obama seems poised to act on immigration, with or without the help of Congress. Last week, he\u160\'00\'A0announced that he's "beginning a new effort to fix as much of our immigration system as I can on my own, without Congress." Critics have decried this very pledge as illegal. But there are legal executive actions he can take to improve our dysfunctional immigration system now.\par \par \uc2 Granted, without Congress, Obama's options are limited. Like making small repairs on a totaled vehicle, he's left tinkering around the edges of a broken system so long as Congress remains deadlocked. Still, even relatively small fixes could improve the lot of millions of immigrants and smooth out some of the rough patches in our overly restrictive system.\par \par \uc2 For example, Obama could allow some illegal\u160\'00\'A0immigrants to apply for green cards through the current immigration system. Currently, unlawful immigrants can't earn a green card because, in order to apply, they have to leave the country. This then triggers a legal catch-22 that bars them from re-entering.\par \par \uc2 The president could institute a "parole in place" for unlawful immigrants who are minors, parents or spouses of U.S. citizens \u8212\'20\'14 people who are otherwise eligible for green cards \u8212\'20\'14 and allow them to apply for green cards without leaving the country.\u160\'00\'A0Stuart Anderson of the National Foundation for American Policy estimates that this reform could legalize 3.5 to 5 million current unauthorized immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Obama could also pressure federal agencies to repeal the onerous regulations they've created that stymie current guest worker visas for lower-skilled immigrants. These administrative rules go beyond what the law requires.\par \par \uc2 For instance, regulations enacted in 2010 significantly raised the costs for farmers to employ guest workers.\u160\'00\'A0The agricultural guest worker visa is theoretically has no cap, but complex regulations imposed by four different federal agencies have stymied the system so much that only 74,192 visas were issued in 2013.\u160\'00\'A0According to a special survey conducted in 2011, 59 percent\u160\'00\'A0of farmers in Georgia said that the program was too costly, too bureaucratically complex, and unworkable.\par \par \uc2 One farmer\u160\'00\'A0complained\u160\'00\'A0that after his wife spent two months filling out the application for guest workers, the government changed the wage rate. Instead of simply amending their application, the farmer said, "we had to start over, and to top it off, our workers were late."\par \par \uc2 Recognizing the burden this placed on both farmers and immigrants, the \uc2 Georgia Department of Agriculture\uc2  suggested creating a new government program to help farmers apply for agricultural guest workers. Instead, Obama should relieve this bureaucratic burden unilaterally by pressing the Department of Labor to streamline and deregulate the program as much as possible. This would decrease demand for unauthorized immigrant workers and relieve the pressure to immigrate illegally.\u160\'00\'A0When the government reformed agricultural guest worker visas in the 1950s, the unauthorized immigrant population dropped by over 90 percent because they were channeled into the legal system and new migrants were able to come legally.\par \par \uc2 It's not just agriculture. Employers in some seasonal hospitality and service sector jobs have access to 66,000. For the H-2B visa, the Department of Labor shortened the work period from 11 months in 2009 to 10 months in 2012 and required the employer to be financially responsible for all inbound and outbound travel to the United States.\par \par \uc2 Such rules decrease the incentive to hire lawful guest workers and thus exacerbate the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  worker problem. The good news is that Congress has not mandated it to be this way. Obama can easily pressure federal agencies to reverse or loosen these obstructive administrative regulations and escape accusations from Republicans that he is exceeding his authority.\par \par \uc2 Most of the public debate over immigration reform centers on the 11 to 12 million unauthorized immigrants who are already here. Solving this mess requires long-term solutions that channel immigrants into the legal immigration system, instead of providing incentives for them to come illegally.\par \par \uc2 But with a Congress that's afraid to tackle immigration reform, the President is left to take practical, and legal, steps in the meantime to improve the system as it currently exists.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020140708ea78005k8\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Two months ago, Lucy Cabrera's adolescent son and daughter called her from Honduras in tears. They said gangs had threatened to kidnap them, and they begged her to help them flee to the United States. She borrowed $6,000 and wired the money to a series of guides in Guatemala and Mexico. On Saturday, her kids called again \u8212\'20\'14 from a U.S. detention facility in Arizona. This time, there were no tears.\par \par \uc2 "Thank God they are safe now. It all happened so fast," said Cabrera, who sells homemade tortillas in the District. Although she is in the country illegally, she said she has been contacted by federal authorities so that both children can eventually be released to her custody. "It's truly a miracle," she marveled.\par \par \uc2 U.S. officials are scrambling to understand and manage the exodus of unaccompanied minors from Central America who have turned up at the southern U.S. border over the past few months. The surge has overwhelmed detention facilities, forcing the Obama administration to take emergency measures to provide shelter, hire attorneys and locate sponsors to receive the children.\par \par \uc2 The number of such minors entering the United States has crept upward since 2011, but last fall it began to skyrocket. Since October, 47,000 have arrived; officials expect another 60,000 by the end of this year.\par \par \uc2 The new surge is partly seasonal, with early summer being the easiest time to travel across the region. But it is mainly driven by two other factors. One is an epidemic of gang violence across El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala that has put many children at risk, especially when parents are not there to protect them. The second is a perception, fueled by certain U.S. policies and by critics of the Obama administration, that the government is treating young illegal immigrants with unprecedented leniency.\par \par \uc2 As a result, thousands of parents like Cabrera sense both an urgent need and a unique opportunity to be reunited with children they left behind years ago to flee conflict or seek a better life. With no legal means to import their children from abroad, many of these undocumented families are putting their hopes in an unexpected source of salvation: the U.S. immigration system.\par \par \uc2 Driven by a mix of rumor, fact and political hyperbole, word has spread through Latino communities in the Washington area and elsewhere that if their children reach the U.S. border alone, they will be allowed to go free.\par \par \uc2 The families' hopes are partly justified because officials have sped up processing the new arrivals to relieve crowded shelters and release as many as possible to relatives or guardians. Unlike children from Mexico, who can be sent back across the border right away, the law allows minors arriving from more distant countries to be sheltered and then handed over to a sponsor while awaiting court hearings.\par \par \uc2 The Washington region, with more than 400,000 residents of Central American origin, is one of several metropolitan areas in the United States where the newly arrived minors are most likely to be sent. Social and legal aid agencies said they have helped hundreds of families petition to receive minors from border detention over the past year.\par \par \uc2 But the speculation that these minors simply will be set free is unfounded. All of them are subject to deportation, and none are eligible for the administration's Dream Act program, which allows some illegal youths to remain if they have lived in the United States for at least five years and can meet other requirements. The newcomers, by contrast, are ordered to appear in immigration court and have no guarantee of being allowed to stay.\par \par \uc2 "The fact that they arrive in the U.S. and are released doesn't give them any legal status at all," said Wendy Young, a lawyer in the District with Kids in Need of Defense, a nonprofit group that provides free legal help for such minors. Some are eligible for special visas or legal protection, such as victims of abuse or trafficking, but Young said at least 60 percent do not qualify and eventually are ordered to be deported.\par \par \uc2 "This is not a slam dunk," she said.\par \par \uc2 Senior administration officials sought to reinforce that message in a teleconference with journalists this week. They said their humanitarian concern for children fleeing "extraordinary violence" in Central America does not change the legal requirement to place them in "removal proceedings," like adults who enter the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 The temptation, of course, is that families whose children face deportation may simply hide them away, shuttling them among friends and relatives in different states. On the other hand, parents or guardians must supply immigration officials with detailed information about themselves in order to receive a child from government custody, making such evasion more difficult.\par \par \uc2 Before they even reach the United States, children face extreme hazards while traveling across Mexico and trying to cross the border. Smugglers often rob, abuse and abandon them; girls are sometimes raped. But more divided families are calculating that the risk is worth it. Once the children reach the border, some parents are instructing them to surrender to once-feared U.S. Border Patrol agents as soon as they can.\par \par \uc2 Susana, a factory worker in Fredericksburg, Va., said she heard last month that minors would be "saved" and let go if they reached the United States. She said she paid $2,800 for guides to bring her 15-year-old daughter from Honduras across Guatemala and Mexico \u8212\'20\'14 where they were expected to "throw her in the river." The girl was quickly picked up by U.S. agents and is now in a federally run secure shelter in Texas.\par \par \uc2 "She was only 5 when I left her, and she has suffered a lot. Everyone was saying, this is the time to send for your kids, the government is letting them go, so I decided to do it," said Susana, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who asked that her full name not be used.\par \par \uc2 Susana said her daughter calls her often from the shelter, where she shares a room with six other girls and takes English classes. Meanwhile, social workers have sent Susana lists of questions and documents to fill out while she readies a bedroom for the daughter she has not seen in a decade. "They want to know about my income and my house and what school she will go to," Susana said. "They say I should be patient and not to worry, soon I will be her guardian."\par \par \uc2 Some parents who are here illegally and are reluctant to allow their children to travel alone have tried to go home and accompany them back \u8212\'20\'14 with disastrous results. Last winter, a house cleaner in Hyattsville, Md., saved up as much money as she could and returned to El Salvador for her two teenage daughters, who were being abused by male relatives and harassed by gangs.\par \par \uc2 According to the woman's mother, the smugglers demanded more than she could pay, and she was worried about the three younger children she had left back in the United States. So in March, she reluctantly left her older girls behind once more and tried to sneak back into the United States. She was caught at the border and now is in federal detention in Texas, unable to care for any of her children.\par \par \uc2 Even when long-separated families are successfully united, they often face daunting adjustment problems. There are stepfathers and younger siblings whom the newly arrived teenagers have never met. There are language barriers and old feelings of anger, jealousy and abandonment. There are crowded apartments and long workdays that offer little chance for special attention. And often, there are the added tensions and uncertainty of the parents being illegal.\par \par \uc2 "In many cases, things turn out to be a disaster," said Dilsia Molina, a counselor at La Clinica del Pueblo in the District who helps dozens of immigrant women with family problems. "I tell all the women that when a child arrives from home after a long time apart, it is like getting pregnant and giving birth all over again."\par \par \uc2 Young said she worries that the accelerated screening process will miss potential problems with sponsors, such as histories of abuse or crime. She noted that proposed guardians are no longer required to provide fingerprints. "We are not pro-detention, but this does create concerns," she said.\par \par \uc2 Another problem is the lack of attorneys available to represent arriving minors who may qualify for deportation relief, asylum or special visas. The White House announced this week that it is setting up an emergency program with funds for about 300 lawyers, but Young said far more are needed.\par \par \uc2 One Salvadoran woman in Prince George's County left her daughter as a small child a decade ago. Last year, the budding adolescent was sent north by grandparents who feared she would be abused by gangs. In Texas, scared and abandoned by smugglers, she turned herself in to the Border Patrol; after several months in custody, she was sent to live with a mother she barely knew.\par \par \uc2 "She seemed more like a sister than a mother," said the girl, now 14, who can manage only a few words of English. The mother, a store cashier, sat close to her on a sofa, looking pensive as the daughter recounted her ordeal in the desert. Both face possible deportation, but both clearly cherish their new relationship. "I was desperately worried about her, but it was definitely worth the risk," the mother confided with a shy glance at the girl. "She is everything to me."\par \par \uc2 pamela.constable@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020140612ea6c007n5\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 "Can anyone spell candidate?"\par \par \uc2 Three boys stood on one side of a worn pool table. Russ Sullivan quizzed them from the other side.\par \par \uc2 "C .\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09. a .\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09. n .\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09. a" ventured the 10-year-old, who was sandwiched between his 9- and 11-year-old brothers. Sullivan, 53, nodded in encouragement, leaning forward, telling him to keep going.\par \par \uc2 "d .\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09. e .\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09. t?"\par \par \uc2 Sullivan smiled and shook his head: "Not. Even. Close!"\par \par \uc2 The boys, and the six 20-something men who have promised to help Sullivan watch, feed and educate his young charges, erupted in laughter. The winner of the weekly session \u8212\'20\'14 with rounds in math, spelling and social studies \u8212\'20\'14 was promised ice cream. The losers' tutors agreed to do push-ups.\par \par \uc2 The oldest boy won, but all three bounced around happily, jumping on their mentors' backs while they hit the floor.\par \par \uc2 For the past decade, Sullivan, a \uc2 McGuireWoods\uc2  lobbyist and former top staffer on the Senate Finance Committee, has come home from long days crafting health-care and tax reform to a gaggle of displaced youngsters in need of guidance and a place to live. In August, he hopes to take on a new challenge: adopting these three boys, whose mother died of breast cancer in January. He has temporary custody.\par \par \uc2 "Russ has two personas," said Sean Neary, a former aide. "He has this persona of being the buttoned-up professional on Capitol Hill who knows the ins-and-outs of every piece of information and really is a deal maker. .\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09. What people didn't realize was that he had this whole other side of him, which is one that cared for some children that were at risk for many, many years."\par \par \uc2 So far, 21 boys and young men have been a part of Sullivan's unconventional family. Some lost their parents, some were abandoned, some had behavioral or substance-abuse issues. Most are in college now; a few dropped out of high school and are working toward GEDs.\par \par \uc2 The oldest calls him Dad. The others call him Pops or Mr. Russ.\par \par \uc2 "There's a huge need here, and somebody's got to fill it," Sullivan said. "Once I started doing it, the joy of seeing the light bulb go off in their mind \u8212\'20\'14 that they can actually get a job, they can function in the business world, they can go to college, they can succeed in sports, or whatever it is they decide they want to do \u8212\'20\'14 is really an in\u173\'00\'ADcred\u173\'00\'ADible thing."\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18I learned to be a parent\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 Sullivan was known on the Hill for his seriousness and humility \u8212\'20\'14 eschewing an office in favor of a desk among the interns, for example. While he is happy to talk about the complicated logistics of guardianship or the dearth of foster parents, he downplays the scope of his undertaking.\par \par \uc2 To hear him tell it, "Son No. 1" came along by chance a little over a decade ago.\par \par \uc2 Sean Jackson was the 16-year-old friend of Sullivan's then-girlfriend's son. She took the boy in when his father died, but she couldn't handle his lying, sneaking out and taking her car. Sullivan said he understood such "teenage boy" behavior: He had worked with kids through church since he was in his 20s. He became Jackson's legal guardian.\par \par \uc2 "The worst two years of my life," Sullivan said. "I learned to be a parent, and unfortunately I had to practice on him." As soon as Jackson turned 18, he moved in with his pregnant girlfriend. Sullivan vowed to try again, to do better.\par \par \uc2 They didn't see each other for years, but eventually reconnected. And on a recent Sunday, Sullivan was at church to see Jackson's child, now 11, baptized.\par \par \uc2 "What did you tell me?" Sullivan teased.\par \par \uc2 "That everything you said was pretty much right," Jackson answered.\par \par \uc2 "That's my favorite line," Sullivan said with satisfaction.\par \par \uc2 Sullivan has met most of the kids through Capitol Area REACH, a mentoring program he helped found. But his name has gotten out to counselors at high schools in Alexandria and Annandale. Few people want to take in teens. Historically, children 9 and older are more likely to age out of the system than be adopted.\par \par \uc2 His drive to foster comes from a deep Christian faith.\par \par \uc2 "Moses was a foster child," he said. "Jesus was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  in Egypt. .\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09. You can't tell me that every kid who comes to America for whatever reason or has a family challenge can't turn out to be one of our leaders."\par \par \uc2 Over the years, Sullivan built his life around the boys. Colleagues on the Hill eventually stopped inviting him to social events he never attended. He left the Senate last year because he needed to make more money to pay for college.\par \par \uc2 Sullivan has moved around in Northern Virginia several times so boys he took in could stay in their local schools. In the Arlington split-level he now shares with the young boys and four adult helpers, Sullivan sleeps on a mattress in the unfinished basement, his suits hanging from a metal beam.\par \par \uc2 He would show up on basketball courts in Alexandria, asking if anyone wanted to go bowling or see a movie.\par \par \uc2 He finds them odd jobs and encourages community service.\par \par \uc2 Abu Massaquoi, 28, or "Son No. 3," recalls Sullivan stopping by his mom's house on Saturday mornings to take him to volunteer.\par \par \uc2 "This African lady is thinking, 'Who's this white man coming into my house to wake up my son?'\u8201\'20\'09" Massaquoi said. Like many of Sullivan's kids, he's Sierra Leonean. "I was kind of rough around the edges. So she knew that if I was trusting him, it was a big deal." Massaquoi ended up living with Sullivan after high school and joining his church.\par \par \uc2 At one point, Sullivan had seven teenage boys living with him in a three-bedroom apartment on Hampton Court in Alexandria.\par \par \uc2 The house rules for the boys were strict and frequently broken: no alcohol, no girls without supervision, a curfew of 10 p.m. on weeknights and 1 a.m. on weekends. Church every Sunday, unless you went to mosque on Friday. No cursing, a rule Sullivan also imposed on his Senate staff. For teens who often had little supervision in their lives, it rankled.\par \par \uc2 "It was like raising a pack of wild hyenas," said Maligie Conteh, 24, who moved in with Sullivan his sophomore year of high school. The now-grown boys discuss Sullivan's ability to learn of transgressions with a mix of annoyance and awe. "Somebody would always tell," said Noble Maduakor, 24, one of a couple kids who were kicked out several times. "And even if you figured out who it was, he'd have somebody else."\par \par \uc2 But if you told him the truth, the boys said, Sullivan would do anything for you. When Conteh was found guilty in 2009 of a robbery he said he didn't commit, Sullivan marshaled lawyers who got the conviction overturned. Those who have left home for school still get regular check-ins by phone. Every year, he takes the whole clan back to his hometown in Arkansas for Christmas with his extended family.\par \par \uc2 Beyond his investigative powers and indefatigability, Sullivan is blessed with a seeming complete lack of self-consciousness. The boys fondly remember a West Virginia ski trip where he cleared the room by asking if any of them wanted to talk about sex. Less fondly, they recall the time he offered to drop them off at a party, then walked in and demanded to speak to the parents. Learning that there were none around, he rounded up his kids and ushered them out.\par \par \uc2 A tragedy in the family only increased his intensity. In fall 2011, A.J. Hassan, another of the young men Sullivan took in, suffered a severe head injury during a fight outside a bar in Morgantown, W.Va., where he was a college student. Deep in negotiations over the debt ceiling in the Senate, Sullivan traveled back and forth from West Virginia to visit Hassan in the hospital. Hassan survived for eight months before dying in a D.C. hospital of complications from surgery.\par \par \uc2 "It finally clicked after my brother passed away," said Loretta Hassan, A.J.'s sister and a 21-year-old college student. She is the only girl who considers Russ a father. "He was there. All these years, Russ has been just the most important person in my life."\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18It just felt right\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 Once his last set of kids graduated from high school, Sullivan planned to take a break. He and his girlfriend were talking about marriage and adopting together \u8212\'20\'14 maybe girls.\par \par \uc2 Then the three boys came into the picture.\par \par \uc2 Rashid Fullah, one of Sullivan's charges who is about to graduate from George Mason, had coached the boys in football for about five years. When their mother died and their father was unable to care for them, Fullah knew where they could find a home.\par \par \uc2 At first, Sullivan worried the skills he has developed wouldn't translate to a younger set of children.\par \par \uc2 "Teenage boys need boundaries. They need fences to make sure they don't do something really stupid," Sullivan said. "None of us are really good at that emotional side of what these 9-, 10-, 11-year-old boys need."\par \par \uc2 Fullah changed his mind, promising he and the others would help.\par \par \uc2 "Russ has been there for me. So to be able to do that for someone else, it's a blessing," Fullah said. "It just felt right."\par \par \uc2 rachel.weiner@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020140614ea6e003s6\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved   \par \par \uc2 Amanda Voisard For The Washington Post Over the years, Russ Sullivan has been a guardian to nearly two dozen teenage boys. He is now taking on the task of raising three young boys whose mother died. "There's a huge need here, and somebody's got to fill it," Sullivan said.\par \par \uc2 "Can anyone spell candidate?"\par \par \uc2 Three boys stood on one side of a worn pool table. Russ Sullivan quizzed them from the other side.\par \par \uc2 "C . . . a . . . n . . . a" ventured the 10-year-old, who was sandwiched between his 9- and 11-year-old brothers. Sullivan, 53, nodded in encouragement, leaning forward, telling him to keep going.\par \par \uc2 "d . . . e . . . t?"\par \par \uc2 Sullivan smiled and shook his head: "Not. Even. Close!"\par \par \uc2 The boys, and the six 20-something men who have promised to help Sullivan watch, feed and educate his young charges, erupted in laughter. The winner of the weekly session - with rounds in math, spelling and social studies - was promised ice cream. The losers' tutors agreed to do push-ups.\par \par \uc2 The oldest boy won, but all three bounced around happily, jumping on the mentors' backs while they hit the floor.\par \par \uc2 For the past decade, Sullivan, a \uc2 McGuireWoods\uc2  lobbyist and former top staffer on the Senate Finance Committee, has come home from long days crafting health-care and tax proposals to a gaggle of displaced youngsters in need of guidance and a place to live. In August, he hopes to take on a new challenge: adopting these three boys, whose mother died of breast cancer in January. He has temporary custody.\par \par \uc2 "Russ has two personas," said Sean Neary, a former aide. "He has this persona of being the buttoned-up professional on Capitol Hill who knows the ins and outs of every piece of information and really is a dealmaker. . . . What people didn't realize was that he had this whole other side of him, which is one that cared for some children that were at risk for many, many years."\par \par \uc2 Amanda Voisard For The Washington Post Sullivan walks home with the three young boys he recently began acting as guardian to following the death of their mother. Christopher Adjepong, a friend to the family, joins the group in the stroll.\par \par \uc2 So far, 21 boys and young men have been a part of Sullivan's unconventional family. Some lost their parents, some were abandoned, some had behavioral or substance-abuse issues. Most are in college now; a few dropped out of high school and are working toward GEDs.\par \par \uc2 The oldest calls him Dad. The others call him Pops or Mr. Russ.\par \par \uc2 "There's a huge need here, and somebody's got to fill it," Sullivan said. "Once I started doing it, the joy of seeing the light bulb go off in their mind - that they can actually get a job, they can function in the business world, they can go to college, they can succeed in sports or whatever it is they decide they want to do - is really an incredible thing."\par \par \uc2 Sullivan was known on the Hill for his seriousness and humility - eschewing an office in favor of a desk among the interns, for example. While he is happy to talk about the complicated logistics of guardianship or the dearth of foster parents, he plays down the scope of his undertaking.\par \par \uc2 To hear him tell it, "Son No. 1" came along by chance a little over a decade ago.\par \par \uc2 Sean Jackson was the 16-year-old friend of Sullivan's then-girlfriend's son. She took the boy in when his father died, but she couldn't handle his lying, sneaking out and taking her car. Sullivan said he understood such "teenage boy" behavior: He had worked with kids through church since he was in his 20s. He became Jackson's legal guardian.\par \par \uc2 "The worst two years of my life," Sullivan said. "I learned to be a parent, and unfortunately I had to practice on him." As soon as he turned 18, Jackson moved in with his pregnant girlfriend. Sullivan vowed to try again, to do better.\par \par \uc2 They didn't see each other for years, but they eventually reconnected. And on a recent Sunday, Sullivan was at church to see Jackson's child, now 11, baptized.\par \par \uc2 Amanda Voisard For The Washington Post Sullivan, middle, speaks with his grandson, Sean Jackson Jr. , before his baptism, which was conducted by Pastor Jim Johnson, left, at the Church of Clarendon. Sullivan's drive to foster comes from a deep Christian faith.\par \par \uc2 "What did you tell me?" Sullivan teased.\par \par \uc2 "That everything you said was pretty much right," Jackson answered.\par \par \uc2 "That's my favorite line," Sullivan said with satisfaction.\par \par \uc2 Sullivan has met most of the kids through Capital Area REACH, a mentoring program he helped found. But his name has gotten out to counselors at high schools in Alexandria and Annandale, Va. Few people want to take in teens. Historically, children 9 and older are more likely to age out of the system than be adopted.\par \par \uc2 His drive to foster comes from a deep Christian faith.\par \par \uc2 "Moses was a foster child," he said. "Jesus was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  in Egypt. . . . You can't tell me that every kid who comes to America for whatever reason or has a family challenge can't turn out to be one of our leaders."\par \par \uc2 Over the years, Sullivan built his life around the boys. Colleagues on the Hill eventually stopped inviting him to social events he never attended. He left the Senate last year because he needed to make more money to pay for college.\par \par \uc2 Sullivan has moved around in Northern Virginia several times so that the boys he took in could stay in their local schools. In the Arlington split-level he now shares with the young boys and four adult helpers, Sullivan sleeps on a mattress in the unfinished basement, his suits hanging from a metal beam.\par \par \uc2 Amanda Voisard For The Washington Post Sullivan said he chose to use the unfinished bedroom in the basement as his living quarters so that he can hear everything that is happening in the house.\par \par \uc2 He would show up on basketball courts in Alexandria, asking if anyone wanted to go bowling or see a movie.\par \par \uc2 He finds them odd jobs and encourages community service.\par \par \uc2 Abu Massaquoi, 28, or "Son No. 3," recalls Sullivan stopping by his mom's house on Saturday mornings to take him to volunteer.\par \par \uc2 "This African lady is thinking, 'Who's this white man coming into my house to wake up my son?' " Massaquoi said. Like many of Sullivan's kids, he's from Sierra Leone. "I was kind of rough around the edges. So she knew that if I was trusting him, it was a big deal." Massaquoi ended up living with Sullivan after high school and joining his church.\par \par \uc2 At one point, Sullivan had seven teenage boys living in his three-bedroom apartment on Hampton Court in Alexandria.\par \par \uc2 The house rules for the boys were strict and frequently broken: No alcohol, no girls without supervision, a curfew of 10 on weeknights and 1 a.m. on weekends. Church every Sunday, unless you went to mosque on Friday. No cursing, a rule Sullivan also imposed on his Senate staff. For teens who often had little supervision in their lives, it rankled.\par \par \uc2 "It was like raising a pack of wild hyenas," said Maligie Conteh, 24, who moved in with Sullivan his sophomore year of high school. The now-grown boys discuss Sullivan's ability to learn of transgressions with a mix of annoyance and awe. "Somebody would always tell," said Noble Maduakor, 24, one of a couple kids who were kicked out several times. "And even if you figured out who it was, he'd have somebody else."\par \par \uc2 Amanda Voisard For The Washington Post Sullivan and Maligie Conteh, 24, who moved in with Sullivan when he was a sophomore in high school. Every year, Sullivan takes the whole clan back to his hometown in Arkansas for Christmas with his extended family.\par \par \uc2 But if you told him the truth, they said, Sullivan would do anything for you. When Conteh was found guilty in 2009 of a robbery he said he didn't commit, Sullivan marshaled lawyers who got the conviction overturned. Those who have left home for school still get regular check-ins by phone. Every year, he takes the whole clan back to his home town in Arkansas for Christmas with his extended family.\par \par \uc2 Beyond his investigative powers and indefatigability, Sullivan has a seeming complete lack of self-consciousness. They fondly remember a West Virginia ski trip when he cleared the room by asking if any of them wanted to talk about sex. Less fondly, they recall the time he offered to drop them off at a party, then walked in and demanded to speak to the parents. Learning that there were none around, he rounded up his kids and ushered them out.\par \par \uc2 A tragedy in the family only increased his intensity. In fall 2011, A.J. Hassan, another of the young men Sullivan took in, suffered a severe head injury during a fight outside a bar in Morgantown, W.Va., where he was a college student. Deep in negotiations over the debt ceiling in the Senate, Sullivan traveled back and forth from West Virginia to visit Hassan in the hospital. Hassan survived for eight months before dying in a D.C. hospital of complications from surgery.\par \par \uc2 Amanda Voisard For The Washington Post Rashid Fullah, 28, holds a photo of A.J. Hassan, 20, who was killed in a fight while attending \uc2 West Virginia University\uc2 . Sullivan traveled back and forth from West Virginia to visit Hassan in the hospital. Hassan survived for eight months before dying in a D.C. hospital of complications from surgery.\par \par \uc2 "It finally clicked after my brother passed away," said Loretta Hassan, A.J.'s sister and a 21-year-old college student. She is the only female who considers Russ a father. "He was there. All these years, Russ has been just the most important person in my life."\par \par \uc2 Once his last set of kids graduated from high school, Sullivan planned to take a break. He and his girlfriend were talking about marriage and adopting together - maybe girls.\par \par \uc2 Then the three boys came into the picture.\par \par \uc2 Rashid Fullah, one of Sullivan's charges who is about to graduate from George Mason, had coached the boys in football for about five years. When their mother died and their father was unable to care for them, Fullah knew where they could find a home.\par \par \uc2 At first, Sullivan worried that the skills he has developed wouldn't translate to a younger set of children.\par \par \uc2 "Teenage boys need boundaries. They need fences to make sure they don't do something really stupid," Sullivan said. "None of us are really good at that emotional side of what these 9-, 10-, 11-year-old boys need."\par \par \uc2 Fullah changed Sullivan's mind, promising that he and the others would help.\par \par \uc2 "Russ has been there for me. So to be able to do that for someone else, it's a blessing," Fullah said. "It just felt right."\par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com\par \par \uc2 WP20140615fosterdad0615\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020140615ea6f0001j\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved   \par \par \uc2 Two months ago, Lucy Cabrera's adolescent son and daughter called her from Honduras in tears. They said gangs had threatened to kidnap them, and they begged her to help them flee to the United States. She borrowed $6,000 and wired the money to a series of guides in Guatemala and Mexico. On Saturday, her kids called again - from a U.S. detention facility in Arizona. This time, there were no tears.\par \par \uc2 "Thank God they are safe now. It all happened so fast," said Cabrera, who sells homemade tortillas in the District. Although she is in the country illegally, she said she has been contacted by federal authorities so that both children can eventually be released to her custody. "It's truly a miracle," she marveled.\par \par \uc2 U.S. officials are scrambling to understand and manage the exodus of unaccompanied minors from Central America who have turned up at the southern U.S. border in recent months. The surge has overwhelmed detention facilities, forcing the Obama administration to take emergency measures to provide shelter, hire attorneys and locate sponsors to receive the children.\par \par \uc2 The number of such minors entering the United States has crept upward since 2011, but last fall it began to skyrocket. Since October, 47,000 have arrived, and officials expect the surge to continue.\par \par \uc2 The new surge is partly seasonal, with early summer being the easiest time to travel across the region. But it is mainly driven by two other factors. One is an epidemic of gang violence across El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala that has put many children at risk, especially when parents are not there to protect them. The second is a perception, fueled by certain U.S. policies and by critics of the Obama administration, that the government is treating young illegal immigrants with unprecedented leniency.\par \par \uc2 As a result, thousands of parents like Cabrera sense both an urgent need and a unique opportunity to be reunited with children they left behind years ago to flee conflict or seek a better life. With no legal means to import their children from abroad, many of these undocumented families are putting their hopes in an unexpected source of salvation: the U.S. immigration system.\par \par \uc2 Driven by a mix of rumor, fact and political hyperbole, word has spread through Latino communities in the Washington area and elsewhere that if their children reach the U.S. border alone, they will be allowed to go free.\par \par \uc2 The families' hopes are partly justified because officials have sped up processing the new arrivals to relieve crowded shelters and release as many as possible to relatives or guardians. Unlike children from Mexico, who can be sent back across the border right away, the law allows minors arriving from more distant countries to be sheltered and then handed over to a sponsor while awaiting court hearings.\par \par \uc2 The Washington region, with more than 400,000 residents of Central American origin, is one of several metropolitan areas in the United States where the newly arrived minors are most likely to be sent. Social- and legal-aid agencies said they have helped hundreds of families petition to receive minors from border detention over the past year.\par \par \uc2 But the speculation that these minors simply will be set free is unfounded. All of them are subject to deportation, and none are eligible for the administration's Dream Act program, which allows some illegal youths to remain if they have lived in the United States for at least five years and can meet other requirements. The newcomers, by contrast, are ordered to appear in immigration court and have no guarantee of being allowed to stay.\par \par \uc2 "The fact that they arrive in the U.S. and are released doesn't give them any legal status at all," said Wendy Young, a lawyer in the District with Kids in Need of Defense, a nonprofit group that provides free legal help for such minors. Some are eligible for special visas or legal protection, such as victims of abuse or trafficking, but Young said at least 60 percent do not qualify and eventually are ordered to be deported.\par \par \uc2 "This is not a slam dunk," she said.\par \par \uc2 Senior administration officials sought to reinforce that message in a teleconference with journalists this week. They said their humanitarian concern for children fleeing "extraordinary violence" in Central America does not change the legal requirement to place them in "removal proceedings," as with adults who enter the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 The temptation, of course, is that families whose children face deportation may simply hide them away, shuttling them among friends and relatives in different states. On the other hand, parents or guardians must supply immigration officials with detailed information about themselves to receive a child from government custody, making such evasion more difficult.\par \par \uc2 Before they even reach the United States, children face extreme hazards while traveling across Mexico and trying to cross the border. Smugglers often rob, abuse and abandon them; girls are sometimes raped. But more divided families are calculating that the risk is worth it. Once the children reach the border, some parents are instructing them to surrender to once-feared U.S. Border Patrol agents as soon as they can.\par \par \uc2 Susana, a factory worker in Fredericksburg, Va., said she heard last month that minors would be "saved" and let go if they reached the United States. She said she paid $2,800 for guides to bring her 15-year-old daughter from Honduras across Guatemala and Mexico - where they were expected to "throw her in the river." The girl was quickly picked up by U.S. agents and is now in a federally run secure shelter in Texas.\par \par \uc2 "She was only 5 when I left her, and she has suffered a lot. Everyone was saying, this is the time to send for your kids, the government is letting them go, so I decided to do it," said Susana, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who asked that her full name not be used.\par \par \uc2 Susana said her daughter calls her often from the shelter, where she shares a room with six other girls and takes English classes. Meanwhile, social workers have sent Susana lists of questions and documents to fill out while she readies a bedroom for the daughter she has not seen in a decade. "They want to know about my income and my house and what school she will go to," Susana said. "They say I should be patient and not to worry, soon I will be her guardian."\par \par \uc2 Some parents who are here illegally and are reluctant to allow their children to travel alone have tried to go home and accompany them back - with disastrous results. Last winter, a house cleaner in Hyattsville, Md., saved up as much money as she could and returned to El Salvador for her two teenage daughters, who were being abused by male relatives and harassed by gangs.\par \par \uc2 According to the woman's mother, the smugglers demanded more than she could pay, and she was worried about the three younger children she had left back in the United States. So in March, she reluctantly left her older girls behind once more and tried to sneak back into the United States. She was caught at the border and now is in federal detention in Texas, unable to care for any of her children.\par \par \uc2 Even when long-separated families are successfully united, they often face daunting adjustment problems. There are stepfathers and younger siblings whom the newly arrived teenagers have never met. There are language barriers and old feelings of anger, jealousy and abandonment. There are crowded apartments and long workdays that offer little chance for special attention. And often, there are the added tensions and uncertainty of the parents being illegal.\par \par \uc2 "In many cases, things turn out to be a disaster," said Dilsia Molina, a counselor at La Clinica del Pueblo in the District who helps dozens of immigrant women with family problems. "I tell all the women that when a child arrives from home after a long time apart, it is like getting pregnant and giving birth all over again."\par \par \uc2 Young said she worries that the accelerated screening process will miss potential problems with sponsors, such as histories of abuse or crime. She noted that proposed guardians are no longer required to provide fingerprints. "We are not pro-detention, but this does create concerns," she said.\par \par \uc2 Another problem is the lack of lawyers available to represent arriving minors who may qualify for deportation relief, asylum or special visas. The White House announced this week that it is setting up an emergency program with funds for about 300 lawyers, but Young said far more are needed.\par \par \uc2 One Salvadoran woman in Prince George's County left her daughter as a small child a decade ago. Last year, the adolescent was sent north by grandparents who feared that she would be abused by gangs. In Texas, scared and abandoned by smugglers, she turned herself in to the Border Patrol; after several months in custody, she was sent to live with a mother she barely knew.\par \par \uc2 "She seemed more like a sister than a mother," said the girl, now 14, who can manage only a few words of English. The mother, a store cashier, sat close to her on a sofa, looking pensive as the daughter recounted her ordeal in the desert. Both face possible deportation, but both clearly cherish their new relationship. "I was desperately worried about her, but it was definitely worth the risk," the mother confided with a shy glance at the girl. "She is everything to me."\par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com\par \par \uc2 WP20140614minors0614\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020140614ea6e0002x\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 At 14, Julio Martinez was a fatherless boy in El Salvador who fell in with a neighborhood gang. Soon, he said, he found himself a virtual prisoner in a larger, violent criminal organization known as MS-13. Gang leaders ordered him to extort his neighbors, beat him when he resisted and threatened him with death when he tried to quit.\par \par \uc2 Today, at 34, Martinez is again a prisoner, this time in federal immigration custody at the Howard County Detention Center. The government is seeking to deport him, but he has mounted a controversial defense that is being closely watched by human rights experts and lawmakers as his case plays out in the federal courts.\par \par \uc2 Technically, Martinez is only being held because he is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 ; after a decade of living and working quietly in Maryland, he was stopped by police in 2011 for making an illegal left turn and then arrested. But as a repentant former gang member in El Salvador who fled to the United States at age 20, he has requested asylum on the grounds that he deserves permanent protection from his former associates.\par \par \uc2 If he wins his case, it could dramatically expand U.S. asylum laws that are mostly used to protect victims of political or religious persecution. He has a bond hearing scheduled for Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 "I ran away from my country to save my life, and I never did any harm," Martinez said in Spanish during a telephone interview from the detention center in Jessup. "The gang leaders said we were all brothers, but it was a lie. They just want to use you. Once you're in, the only way you leave is dead. They already tried to kill me twice, and if I am sent back, they will still be hunting for me."\par \par \uc2 Although the chances of former gang members such as Martinez obtaining permanent asylum might appear to be slim, the courts remain divided on the issue. In several recent rulings on his case and two others, federal immigration and appeals courts have given contradictory answers as to whether such people deserve American sanctuary from the violent consequences of their former lives.\par \par \uc2 One issue is how to decide whether the person is truly repentant; another is the more technical question of how to define a gang. Currently, asylum-seekers must belong to a recognizable class of people who are vulnerable to persecution based on their race, religion, ideology or membership in a "particular social group." Does a gang qualify as a social group?\par \par \uc2 Maureen Sweeney, director of the immigration clinic at the University of Maryland's Carey School of Law, is representing Martinez. She thinks U.S. asylum law should be changed to allow such immigrants to seek protection if they renounce gang life at their peril. Thousands of gang members in the United States have been deported to El Salvador in the past two decades; there is no estimate of how many others have attempted to repudiate their past.\par \par \uc2 "One foundation of our asylum law is that someone's conscience should not have to be sacrificed for their safety," Sweeney said. "The burden of proof in asylum cases is difficult to meet, but if someone can convince a judge they genuinely left a gang and face danger as a result, they have met that burden of proof and should be protected."\par \par \uc2 The other side of the argument is that members of violent gangs should never be rewarded, and that granting asylum to those who claim repentance would open the floodgates to predatory immigrants who want to avoid deportation.\par \par \uc2 Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, objected strongly to a February court ruling in Martinez's favor, saying it "encourages fraud and creates a new loophole where gang members can simply claim they are no longer a member of a gang in order to game the immigration system." The result, he added, would be to "endanger our communities" through the scourge of gang violence.\par \par \uc2 Attempts on his life\par \par \uc2 Despite his off-putting r\u233\'00\'E9sum\u233\'00\'E9 and the gang initials MS (for Mara Salvatrucha) tattooed on his stomach when he was 14, Martinez is in some ways a perfect example for his cause.\par \par \uc2 According to Martinez, he was lured into gang life at a young age, committed no serious crimes and made extraordinary attempts to escape the gang once he realized its coldblooded agenda of extorting money from ordinary people and brutally enforcing members' fealty.\par \par \uc2 "They wanted me to take money from people I had known all my life, but I didn't want to," he said. As punishment for his change of heart, gang leaders ordered his execution. One group of enforcers stabbed him and left him for dead, he said. After recovering, he fled to a relative's village, but gang members tracked him down, shot at him and threatened his family.\par \par \uc2 Finally, he fled to the United States and moved in with his oldest sister, Melva Ordonez, a housecleaner in Baltimore. Last week, Ordonez recounted the hardships and terrors of their childhood \u8212\'20\'14 growing up without parents, fleeing from crossfire between Salvadoran soldiers and guerrillas. She left for the United States as soon as she could, while her adolescent brother gravitated to a local gang.\par \par \uc2 "We all suffered, but we were still innocent back then," she said. "The gangs seemed to offer so much. They had come from America with their promises and their tattoo machines. But all they really offered was death."\par \par \uc2 Still close to Martinez, she visits him often at Jessup. "I don't justify what he did, but I ask God to help him," she said. "The gangs are much worse now. I know after 20 years, even 40 years, they will still come after him."\par \par \uc2 Martinez's track record in the United States has been far from flawless. He accumulated multiple traffic citations, missed court dates and filing deadlines after an initial run-in with immigration authorities, and was finally jailed after the 2011 traffic violation. But for a full decade, he also avoided serious trouble and worked steadily \u8212\'20\'14 cutting grass, hanging drywall, washing dishes, driving a cab \u8212\'20\'14 until his arrest.\par \par \uc2 Mixed signals from courts\par \par \uc2 His legal case has been protracted and dizzying. Last year, two immigration courts ruled he was not eligible for legal protection, but in January they were overruled by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit. In that decision, Judge Paul Niemeyer found that Martinez risked being killed if forced to return to El Salvador, and that his earlier gang involvement did not disqualify him from protection.\par \par \uc2 "Martinez is not a gang member. Rather, the social group he has identified is defined by rejection of gang membership and its attendant violence," the judge wrote, adding that Martinez had repudiated gang life as a matter of "conscience" and should not be penalized for it.\par \par \uc2 Two other appeals courts have issued similar rulings, but the 1st Circuit reached an opposite conclusion in October in the case of Kevin Claros, a Salvadoran who came to the United States as a child, spent two years in a violent Latino gang in Boston and claimed he feared reprisals from related gang members if deported to his homeland.\par \par \uc2 Although they found Claros "sincere" in wanting to leave the gang, the judges in that case did not think he would face persecution in El Salvador. They also found that Congress, in passing humanitarian laws, never meant to "grant asylum to those whose association with a criminal syndicate has caused them to run into danger." To do so, the court added, would "offer an incentive for aliens to join gangs here as a path to legal status."\par \par \uc2 But immigration lawyers and rights groups said the threats of harm to people such as Martinez and Claros are real, and that the lethal reach of Central American gangs is wide and persistent, with ex-members and their families often hunted across multiple borders and killed. The two largest gangs \u8212\'20\'14 MS-13 and 18th Street \u8212\'20\'14 have between 50,000 and 85,000 members in El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala. MS-13 also has an entrenched presence in the United States, including in the Washington region.\par \par \uc2 The groups point out that U.S. law bars anyone with a history of serious or violent crime from obtaining asylum or other forms of exemption from deportation. In some cases, they contend, former gang members are more victims of gang predations than willing participants.\par \par \uc2 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2  officials declined to comment on Martinez's case, citing the pending appeals, and also rejected a reporter's request to visit Martinez in detention.\par \par \uc2 After three years of being shifted among detention centers around the country, Martinez said he has spent a lot of time thinking about how he fell into gang life, and how he would advise other young Latinos to avoid it. He has met other former gang members who became more deeply involved than he did and are even less likely to find safety.\par \par \uc2 "I would tell young boys stay in school, stay close to their families, and not believe what the gangs tell them," Martinez said. "For a lot of the older ones, it is too late. By the time they realize what's going on, they are in a hole and they can never climb out."\par \par \uc2 pamela.constable@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020140518ea5i005xx\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved   \par \par \uc2 At 14, Julio Martinez was a fatherless boy in El Salvador who fell in with a neighborhood gang. Soon, he said, he found himself a virtual prisoner in a larger, violent criminal organization known as MS-13. Gang leaders ordered him to extort his neighbors, beat him when he resisted and threatened him with death when he tried to quit.\par \par \uc2 Today, at 34, Martinez is again a prisoner, this time in federal immigration custody at the Howard County Detention Center. The government is seeking to deport him, but he has mounted a controversial defense that is being closely watched by human rights experts and lawmakers as his case plays out in the federal courts.\par \par \uc2 Technically, Martinez is only being held because he is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 ; after a decade of living and working quietly in Maryland, he was stopped by police in 2011 for making an illegal left turn and then arrested. But as a repentant former gang member in El Salvador who fled to the United States at age 20, he has requested asylum on the grounds that he deserves permanent protection from his former associates.\par \par \uc2 If he wins his case, it could dramatically expand U.S. asylum laws that are mostly used to protect victims of political or religious persecution. He has a bond hearing scheduled for Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 "I ran away from my country to save my life, and I never did any harm," Martinez said in Spanish during a telephone interview from the detention center in Jessup. "The gang leaders said we were all brothers, but it was a lie. They just want to use you. Once you're in, the only way you leave is dead. They already tried to kill me twice, and if I am sent back, they will still be hunting for me."\par \par \uc2 Although the chances of former gang members such as Martinez obtaining permanent asylum might appear to be slim, the courts remain divided on the issue. In several recent rulings on his case and two others, federal immigration and appeals courts have given contradictory answers as to whether such people deserve American sanctuary from the violent consequences of their former lives.\par \par \uc2 One issue is how to decide whether the person is truly repentant; another is the more technical question of how to define a gang. Currently, asylum-seekers must belong to a recognizable class of people who are vulnerable to persecution based on their race, religion, ideology or membership in a "particular social group." Does a gang qualify as a social group?\par \par \uc2 Maureen Sweeney, director of the immigration clinic at the University of Maryland's Carey School of Law, is representing Martinez. She thinks U.S. asylum law should be changed to allow such immigrants to seek protection if they renounce gang life at their peril. Thousands of gang members in the United States have been deported to El Salvador in the past two decades; there is no estimate of how many others have attempted to repudiate their past.\par \par \uc2 "One foundation of our asylum law is that someone's conscience should not have to be sacrificed for their safety," Sweeney said. "The burden of proof in asylum cases is difficult to meet, but if someone can convince a judge they genuinely left a gang and face danger as a result, they have met that burden of proof and should be protected."\par \par \uc2 The other side of the argument is that members of violent gangs should never be rewarded, and that granting asylum to those who claim repentance would open the floodgates to predatory immigrants who want to avoid deportation.\par \par \uc2 Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, objected strongly to a February court ruling in Martinez's favor, saying it "encourages fraud and creates a new loophole where gang members can simply claim they are no longer a member of a gang in order to game the immigration system." The result, he added, would be to "endanger our communities" through the scourge of gang violence.\par \par \uc2 Despite his off-putting r\u233\'00\'E9sum\u233\'00\'E9 and the gang initials MS (for Mara Salvatrucha) tattooed on his stomach when he was 14, Martinez is in some ways a perfect example for his cause.\par \par \uc2 According to Martinez, he was lured into gang life at a young age, committed no serious crimes and made extraordinary attempts to escape the gang once he realized its coldblooded agenda of extorting money from ordinary people and brutally enforcing members' fealty.\par \par \uc2 "They wanted me to take money from people I had known all my life, but I didn't want to," he said. As punishment for his change of heart, gang leaders ordered his execution. One group of enforcers stabbed him and left him for dead, he said. After recovering, he fled to a relative's village, but gang members tracked him down, shot at him and threatened his family.\par \par \uc2 Finally, he fled to the United States and moved in with his oldest sister, Melva Ordonez, a housecleaner in Baltimore. Last week, Ordonez recounted the hardships and terrors of their childhood - growing up without parents, fleeing from crossfire between Salvadoran soldiers and guerrillas. She left for the United States as soon as she could, while her adolescent brother gravitated to a local gang.\par \par \uc2 "We all suffered, but we were still innocent back then," she said. "The gangs seemed to offer so much. They had come from America with their promises and their tattoo machines. But all they really offered was death."\par \par \uc2 Still close to Martinez, she visits him often at Jessup. "I don't justify what he did, but I ask God to help him," she said. "The gangs are much worse now. I know after 20 years, even 40 years, they will still come after him."\par \par \uc2 Martinez's track record in the United States has been far from flawless. He accumulated multiple traffic citations, missed court dates and filing deadlines after an initial run-in with immigration authorities, and was finally jailed after the 2011 traffic violation. But for a full decade, he also avoided serious trouble and worked steadily - cutting grass, hanging drywall, washing dishes, driving a cab - until his arrest.\par \par \uc2 His legal case has been protracted and dizzying. Last year, two immigration courts ruled he was not eligible for legal protection, but in January they were overruled by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit. In that decision, Judge Paul Niemeyer found that Martinez risked being killed if forced to return to El Salvador, and that his earlier gang involvement did not disqualify him from protection.\par \par \uc2 "Martinez is not a gang member. Rather, the social group he has identified is defined by rejection of gang membership and its attendant violence," the judge wrote, adding that Martinez had repudiated gang life as a matter of "conscience" and should not be penalized for it.\par \par \uc2 Two other appeals courts have issued similar rulings, but the 1st Circuit reached an opposite conclusion in October in the case of Kevin Claros, a Salvadoran who came to the United States as a child, spent two years in a violent Latino gang in Boston and claimed he feared reprisals from related gang members if deported to his homeland.\par \par \uc2 Although they found Claros "sincere" in wanting to leave the gang, the judges in that case did not think he would face persecution in El Salvador. They also found that Congress, in passing humanitarian laws, never meant to "grant asylum to those whose association with a criminal syndicate has caused them to run into danger." To do so, the court added, would "offer an incentive for aliens to join gangs here as a path to legal status."\par \par \uc2 But immigration lawyers and rights groups said the threats of harm to people such as Martinez and Claros are real, and that the lethal reach of Central American gangs is wide and persistent, with ex-members and their families often hunted across multiple borders and killed. The two largest gangs - MS-13 and 18th Street - have between 50,000 and 85,000 members in El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala. MS-13 also has an entrenched presence in the United States, including in the Washington region.\par \par \uc2 The groups point out that U.S. law bars anyone with a history of serious or violent crime from obtaining asylum or other forms of exemption from deportation. In some cases, they contend, former gang members are more victims of gang predations than willing participants.\par \par \uc2 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2  officials declined to comment on Martinez's case, citing the pending appeals, and also rejected a reporter's request to visit Martinez in detention.\par \par \uc2 After three years of being shifted among detention centers around the country, Martinez said he has spent a lot of time thinking about how he fell into gang life, and how he would advise other young Latinos to avoid it. He has met other former gang members who became more deeply involved than he did and are even less likely to find safety.\par \par \uc2 "I would tell young boys stay in school, stay close to their families, and not believe what the gangs tell them," Martinez said. "For a lot of the older ones, it is too late. By the time they realize what's going on, they are in a hole and they can never climb out."\par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com\par \par \uc2 WP20140519gangcase0519\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020140519ea5j0000q\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 A Florida gubernatorial candidate who won the governor's mansion by appealing to the far right on everything from immigration to health care reform is singing a surprisingly different tune as he seeks office again. But it's not former governor \uc2 Charlie Crist\uc2 , the Republican-turned-Democrat who's changed his position on issues across the ideological landscape; it's Crist's successor, Gov. Rick Scott (R).\par \par \uc2 Scott, whose approval ratings are dismally underwater and who trails Crist in the governor's race in most public polls, has said this week he will sign legislation allowing the children of undocumented workers to pay in-state tuition when they attend universities. He also signaled he will sign a measure to legalize the use of a medical marijuana extract to treat patients suffering from epilepsy and other diseases.\par \par \uc2 Both positions stand at odds with Scott's earlier actions. In 2010, Scott advocated a crackdown on illegal immigrants living in Florida, on par with a similar bill that generated controversy in Arizona. Last year, he vetoed legislation that would allow undocumented immigrants to obtain a driver's license.\par \par \uc2 And just a few months ago, Scott said he would vote against a ballot initiative that would legalize marijuana for medical uses.\par \par \uc2 "Having seen the terrible effects of alcohol and drug abuse first-hand, I cannot endorse sending Florida down this path, and I would personally vote against [the initiative]," Scott said in January. "No matter my personal beliefs, however, a ballot initiative would be up to the voters to decide."\par \par \uc2 This week, Scott reversed himself. "I'm a parent and a grandparent," Scott told the Associated Press. "I want to make sure my children, my grandchildren have access to the health care they want."\par \par \uc2 Scott has even reversed himself on part of the Affordable Care Act. Scott initially said he would not move to expand Medicaid in Florida after the Supreme Court left the decision up to states. Less than a year later, in 2013, Scott said he would press legislators to expand Medicaid for three years.\par \par \uc2 "While the federal government is committed to paying 100 percent of the cost of new people in Medicaid, I cannot, in good conscience, deny the uninsured access to care," Scott said at the time (The legislature has so far resisted Scott's call to expand Medicaid.)\par \par \uc2 Democrats say Scott's flip-flops are little more than an election year gambit for votes. "It's fair to assume every decision he is making right now is to stay in office, and not for the people," said Kevin Cate, a spokesman for Crist's campaign.\par \par \uc2 Scott's campaign said the governor has been clear about his priorities \u8212\'20\'14 "lower taxes for our families, lower tuition for our students and fair access to education for all Floridians," said Greg Blair, a campaign spokesman. "Gov. Scott has delivered those major victories and will proudly spend the next six months comparing his accomplishments with \uc2 Charlie Crist\uc2 's record."\par \par \uc2 Scott is not a man of half-measures. His first foray into politics involved spending millions of his own dollars on advertisements against the Affordable Care Act. He spent $78 million more to win the governorship in 2010 and pushed a conservative-backed legislative agenda.\par \par \uc2 Now, facing daunting poll numbers \u8212\'20\'14 a \uc2 Quinnipiac University\uc2  survey released earlier this week showed Scott trailing Crist by 48 percent to 38 percent\u8212\'20\'14 Scott is reaching out to the center, and especially to Hispanic voters crucial to winning statewide in Florida.\par \par \uc2 Scott won a bare majority, 50 percent, of the Hispanic vote in 2010, when he beat Democrat Alex Sink by a single percentage point. The Quinnipiac poll showed Scott trailing Crist among Hispanics by a\u160\'00\'A046 percent to 28 percent margin.\u160\'00\'A0That alone could be enough to hand Crist the election.\par \par \uc2 Repairing the damage means embracing the in-state tuition bill: The Quinnipiac poll showed 55 percent of voters agreed that an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who attended high school in Florida should be allowed to pay in-state tuition at a state university.\par \par \uc2 It also means embracing medical marijuana. Some Democrats hoped that the initiative, which qualified for the ballot earlier this year, would drive turnout among younger voters, who are more likely to sit out midterm elections. A Quinnipiac poll from last year showed 82 percent of Floridians thought marijuana should be legal for medical use.\par \par \uc2 But don't expect Crist to attack Scott's evolving positions. After all, the candidate once known as "Chain Gang Charlie" now backs legalizing marijuana for medical uses.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020140502ea52006va\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

Lou Barletta, from small-town mayor to \uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2  basher to \b0\par\par\uc2 By Al Kamen   \par \uc2 292 \uc2 words\par \uc2 5 March 2014\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2014, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Before he took his place as a rank-and-file congressman, Rep. Lou Barletta (R-Pa.) was a go-it-alone, \uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2 -busting, small-town mayor of Hazleton, Pa., population about 25,000.\par \par \uc2 Hazleton, nestled in Northeast Pennsylvania's coal region, hit the national stage in 2006 when Barletta pushed through one of the nation's strictest anti-illegal immigration ordinances, including a provision that penalizes landlords who knowingly rent to illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 A lawsuit over the never-enforced statute has ping-ponged through the court system since then, with a Philadelphia-based federal appeals court most recently striking it down. The Supreme Court declined to hear Hazleton's appeal Monday.\par \par \uc2 Barletta, now nationally well-known (or infamous, depending on perspective), rode chest-puffed to Congress on the 2010 Republican wave. He told the Loop on Monday that while "very disappointed" in the high court's decision, he will not give up his quest to weed out illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 "That's the end of it," Barletta said sourly, though he cited another federal appeals court ruling that upheld a similar law.\par \par \uc2 Congress has all but thrown in the towel on reconciling any immigration bill this year, but Barletta vows to continue to fight from the back benches. He's now able to craft legislation, not just to save one town but the entire nation from "terrorists and drug dealers," he says. Which, he adds, is an "even bigger role than the role I had as mayor."\par \par \uc2 Given the GOP need to attract Latino voters in 2014 and beyond, the party leadership may decide to relegate him to a cameo rather than center stage.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020140304ea340050l\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved   \par \par \uc2 Seems Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) has taken of late to smacking his "friend" Secretary of State John Kerry for being an overly frequent flier.\par \par \uc2 In November, McCain made some news.\par \par \uc2 "This guy has been a human wrecking ball," he said of Kerry in an interview with Jeffrey Goldberg at the Washington Ideas Forum.\par \par \uc2 "They don't know from one hour to the next where the plane is going," McCain said. Washington's Mideast policy "is in such disarray," he added. "Fly into Riyadh and talk to the king of Saudi Arabia. Fly into Egypt and praise their steps toward democracy."\par \par \uc2 Kerry reportedly called McCain after that blast and the two talked it over. We had hoped they had worked things out.\par \par \uc2 Apparently not. A couple of weeks ago, McCain renewed the criticism after Kerry spoke in Indonesia about climate change as "a weapon of mass destruction."\par \par \uc2 "So he has to go over to Asia" and talk about that? McCain asked on Mike Broomhead's Phoenix radio show, noting more immediate concerns Kerry should focus on, such as the massive carnage in Syria, Iranian nuclear ambitions and so on. He accused Kerry of "butterflying around the world," asking: "Hello? On what planet does he reside?"\par \par \uc2 Yikes!\par \par \uc2 Well, we used to think substantial travel came with the job of being secretary of state. So let's look at the travel data. According to the State Department's Web site, Kerry took 20 trips abroad in 2013. Ten were to the Middle East. In addition, some of the European trips also involved negotiations on Mideast issues.\par \par \uc2 As it turns out, McCain, who is the ranking Republican on the Senate Homeland Security Committee's investigations subcommittee, does a pretty solid amount of traveling himself, according to the Senate's quarterly reports.\par \par \uc2 We counted 12 foreign trips by McCain in 2013. By way of comparison, that's about twice as many as the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's top GOP member, Sen. \uc2 Bob Corker\uc2  (Tenn.), took last year.\par \par \uc2 Like Kerry, half of McCain's trips (six) took him to the Middle East. He also did an Asia swing through Japan, China, Mongolia and South Korea, and he made a trip to Ukraine.\par \par \uc2 McCain's fact-finding trips, as we've often noted, are business, not boondoggles. But he and his accompanying staff have racked up more than a couple hundred thousand dollars in travel expenses - not counting the costs of any military jets.\par \par \uc2 We can safely assume Kerry's trips on his plane are hugely expensive, but working on deals on Mideast peace, Syria's chemical weapons and Iran's nukes might be worth going an extra mile or two.\par \par \uc2 The chief difference, of course, is that while McCain can assess and investigate, Kerry has to do some very heavy lifting in a lot of difficult places.\par \par \uc2 In any event, this year's looking pretty good on the travel front. Kerry was in super-tony Davos, Switzerland, in January for the World's Greatest Gabfest (WGG).\par \par \uc2 Hey! So was McCain.\par \par \uc2 Before he took his place as a rank-and-file congressman, Rep. Lou Barletta (R-Pa.) was the go-it-alone, \uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2 -busting mayor of Hazleton, Pa., population about 25,000.\par \par \uc2 Hazleton, nestled in eastern Pennsylvania's coal region, hit the national stage in 2006 when Barletta pushed through one of the nation's strictest anti-illegal-immigration ordinances, including a provision that penalized landlords who knowingly rent to illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 A lawsuit over the never-enforced statute has ping-ponged through the court system since then, with a Philadelphia-based federal appeals court most recently striking it down. On Monday, the Supreme Court declined to hear Hazleton's appeal.\par \par \uc2 Barletta, now nationally well known (or infamous, depending on your perspective), rode chest-puffed to Congress on the 2010 Republican wave. He told the Loop on Monday that while he's "very disappointed" in the high court's decision, he will not give up his quest to weed out illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 "That's the end of it," Barletta said sourly about Hazleton's embattled ordinance. Though he cited another federal appeals court ruling that upheld a similar law as a legal contradiction.\par \par \uc2 Congress has all but thrown in the towel on reconciling any immigration bill this year, but Barletta vows to continue to fight from the back benches. He's now able to craft legislation, to save not just one town but the entire nation from "terrorists and drug dealers," he says.\par \par \uc2 Which, he adds, is an "even bigger role than the role I had as mayor."\par \par \uc2 Given the GOP need to attract Latino voters in 2014 and beyond, the party leadership may decide to relegate him to a cameo rather than center stage.\par \par \uc2 One surefire way to get an issue in front of a congressional committee? Hire a lobbyist with the same last name as the chairman.\par \par \uc2 In the transportation world, the surname Shuster is as golden as Kennedy. So it's little wonder companies looking to infiltrate Capitol Hill would turn to a law firm that employs a Shuster.\par \par \uc2 Last time we checked in with Robert Shuster - brother to House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman Bill Shuster (R-Pa.) and son of Bud Shuster (known for unapologetically shoveling money at Pennsylvania public works projects when he chaired the same panel in the mid- to late 1990s) - he'd been hired by the town of Chevy Chase as a lawyer against the Purple Line light-rail project.\par \par \uc2 Now another of Robert Shuster's clients has the undivided attention of brother Bill's committee. The president of Canada Steamship Lines, which lobbying disclosure data tells us has hired Shuster to lobby Congress on its behalf, testified Tuesday before a T&I subcommittee.\par \par \uc2 The inland shipping operation opposes new \uc2 Environmental Protection Agency\uc2  fuel-emissions standards.\par \par \uc2 Shuster e-mailed us to say he's had only "very limited" action with the steamship line and he told them, as he does with all clients, "that I do not and will not lobby my brother."\par \par \uc2 But when transportation is the family business, it's hard to imagine shipping issues aren't the focus of dinnertime chatter around the Thanksgiving table.\par \par \uc2 - With Colby Itkowitz\par \par \uc2 The blog: washingtonpost.com/intheloop. \uc2 Twitter\uc2 : @InTheLoopWP. \par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com\par \par \uc2 WP20140305f-loop0305\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020140305ea350004a\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 JUST A week ago, House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) issued a set of Republican principles that established a framework for reforming the nation's broken immigration system. Now, in a whirlwind about-face, the speaker declares that the prospects for immigration legislation this year are slight because Republicans don't trust President Obama to enforce laws the House might pass.\par \par \uc2 The suggestion that the president doesn't or wouldn't enforce immigration laws is transparently false. In the very near future, the Obama administration will deport its 2 millionth \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , a pace much faster than that of President \uc2 George W. Bush\uc2  or any previous president. Under Mr. Obama, apprehensions along the Southwest frontier \u8212\'20\'14 a reflection of illegal border crossing activity \u8212\'20\'14 have fallen to a four-decade low. The number of Border Patrol agents has doubled in the past decade, to say nothing of sharply higher spending on other agencies and resources meant to stop illegal crossings.\par \par \uc2 Has all of this been lost on Mr. Boehner?\par \par \uc2 No, the speaker's assertion is a smoke screen designed to obscure the fact that rank-and-file Republicans refuse to tackle immigration reform. Many persist in the fantasy that 11.7\u8201\'20\'09million illegal immigrants, among them at least 7\u8201\'20\'09million with jobs, should be forced to leave the country, and that anything short of that amounts to amnesty. Some might not buy into the self-deportation myth but fear a primary challenge if they appear lax. Others, more calculatingly, are loath to debate an issue that could prompt a venomous internecine fight, divert attention from what they see as the debacle of the Affordable Care Act and diminish GOP prospects in this fall's midterm elections.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Boehner might have summoned the spine to quiet those doubts and coax his party toward immigration reform anyway. Or he could have acknowledged that despite his best efforts, he found the political problems within his party insurmountable. Instead, he blamed the GOP's paralysis on Mr. Obama \u8212\'20\'14 concocting a weak excuse about the president's supposed trustworthiness \u8212\'20\'14 in hopes that the best defense is an aggressive offense.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Boehner appears to genuinely support immigration reform and to grasp that it is a slow-motion demographic and political disaster for his party to continue to obstruct it. Perhaps his strategy is to wait and grapple with his caucus another day. But he undercuts his case when he lends credence to the canard that immigration law is not being enforced. The reality of enforcement under the Obama administration is measured in deportations that have fractured hundreds of thousands of families and upended hundreds of thousands of lives. It is apparent in long stretches of the border, once highly permeable, that are now so highly militarized that illegal crossings are difficult to impossible. It is reflected in the fact that for the first time in years, as many or more illegal immigrants have been leaving the country as entering it.\par \par \uc2 By recycling the lie about lax enforcement, Mr.\u8201\'20\'09Boehner encourages those in his party who would demand unattainable levels of border impermeability as a precondition for reform. That's a recipe for paralysis.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020140208ea28005pp\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 HOUSE REPUBLICANS, who have dug in their heels against immigration reform for months, may be running out of excuses.\par \par \uc2 Congress has cleared the decks for action on non-fiscal issues by passing a budget deal that lifts the threat of further government shutdowns for the time being. In New Jersey, the Republican governor, \uc2 Chris Christie\uc2 , after waffling for a few weeks, signed a bill granting in-state college tuition subsidies to undocumented students brought to the United States as children by their \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  parents.\par \par \uc2 And in a new survey by the Pew Research Center, Hispanics, by a 5-to-3 margin, said it was more important to allow unauthorized immigrants to work and live in this country without fear of deportation than to put them on a path to citizenship. That idea \u8212\'20\'14 granting legal status short of citizenship to illegal immigrants \u8212\'20\'14 has been percolating in Washington for months. The fact that it is backed by a majority of Latinos, who are the nation's largest minority group as well as the largest chunk of illegal immigrants, provides an opening for compromise in Congress, if both sides will take it.\par \par \uc2 House Republican leaders have refused to take up the immigration overhaul passed in June by the Senate, despite the fact that it would probably pass if it were allowed a vote on the floor. The main impediment is hostility from the GOP's rank-and-file to a pathway to citizenship, even one drawn out over 13 or more years, because many conservatives regard it as amnesty.\par \par \uc2 Republican hard-liners could still insist (and many no doubt would) that providing deportation relief to more than 11 million illegal immigrants amounts to amnesty, too, even without the hope of citizenship. They would prefer mass round-ups or, for the more politically correct, "self-deportation" \u8212\'20\'14 a polite way of saying that local authorities should make life so miserable for undocumented immigrants, most of whom have lived and worked in this country for years, that they will simply pack up and leave. That's a fantasy.\par \par \uc2 More realistic House Republicans, who appear to include the leadership, realize that the nation must come to terms with illegal immigrants, who are deeply woven into the fabric of communities and the economy across America. Deportation relief without citizenship may achieve that goal.\par \par \uc2 It's not an ideal solution, and many Democrats will bristle at it. It would create a caste of what would amount to second-class citizens, authorized to stay and work but not to vote or, perhaps, qualify for certain other privileges of full-fledged citizenship. Nonetheless, something has to move the ball on immigration in Congress, where it has been stalled for more than seven years. The status quo, which during the Obama administration has included deporting around 400,000 people annually, often breaking up families in the process, is unworkable and counterproductive; it neither fixes a broken system nor meets the economy's demand for labor. In 2014, House Republicans will be out of excuses.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020131222e9cm004pj\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 New Jersey Gov. \uc2 Chris Christie\uc2  (R) forcefully denied Monday that he has switched positions on in-state tuition for young illegal immigrants, saying he continues to support the idea but won't sign the specific bill passed by the state legislature.\par \par \uc2 Christie said during his 2013 reelection campaign that he supported the concept of the legislation, commonly known as the Dream Act. He wound up winning 51 percent of the Latino vote, according to exit polls.\par \par \uc2 But when the state legislature initially passed the legislation, Christie said it went too far -- including offering financial aid for these students -- and risked making New Jersey a magnet for young illegal immigrants. He asked the Democratic-controlled state legislature to make changes to the measure and said he wouldn't sign it without them. The legislature declined, leading to a stalemate.\par \par \uc2 On Sunday, the state's largest newspaper, the Star-Ledger, accused Christie of flip-flopping on the issue because he wants to run for the GOP nomination for president in 2016.\par \par \uc2 Christie reiterated Monday that he won't sign the bill as it's currently written but said it has everything to do with the other parts of the bill and not in-state tuition. He said his position during this year's campaign pertained to the general idea and not a specific piece of legislation and, thus, has been consistent.\par \par \uc2 "I didn't support any particular piece of legislation, and I still support tuition equality," Christie said, according to a transcript. "Here's what I don't support: I don't support tuition aid grants in addition to in-state tuition rates; never said that I did, and don't as we stand here today."\par \par \uc2 While 16 states provide in-state tuition for young illegal immigrants, only three go a step further and provide financial aid, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. New Jersey would be the fourth.\par \par \uc2 Christie also argued that the New Jersey legislation would give young illegal immigrants a benefit that isn't even available to U.S. citizens. He said that if an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from outside the state attended a New Jersey school for three years, the bill would allow for him or her to get in-state tuition, while a U.S. citizen from outside the state in the same situation wouldn't get that benefit.\par \par \uc2 "So that's an inequity that is pretty easily cleared up and cleaned up, and they've refused to do that," Christie said of the state legislature.\par \par \uc2 Christie also said that the legislation needs to only apply to illegal immigrants who were in the United States by 2012, so that it doesn't lead to more illegal immigration in the future.\par \par \uc2 Absent those changes, he said, "I won't sign it. And so I don't think this is any different position than I've had all along. I am for tuition equality as I said that night at the Latino Leadership Alliance. I am for tuition equality. I am not for adding tuition aid grants."\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020131202e9c2006my\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved   \par \par \uc2 Bicyclists face numerous dangers as they struggle to share already congested roads with drivers. In the United States, a cyclist is killed every 12.6 hours.\par \par \uc2 But for women, gay men and transgender people, the dangers can be compounded by harassment and the threat of assault.\par \par \uc2 For Kate, a 28-year-old cycling enthusiast, summer is always the worst. Pedestrians feel free to yell what they perceive as compliments: "Yeah, you look good!" or "Can I ride with you?"\par \par \uc2 "As a woman, I'm constantly operating with the low-level fear that any man might attack me," said Kate, a resident of the Brookland neighborhood in Northeast Washington, who asked that her last name not be used because of safety concerns.\par \par \uc2 Once, a male cyclist pulled up alongside her on the C&O Canal towpath, presumably thinking she wanted company. He asked her to stop because he needed to urinate - not in the bushes, but on the trail, exposing himself for anyone to see. She sped away, but he chased her down. He asked her out; she declined.\par \par \uc2 Stop Street Harassment, an international nonprofit organization, works to combat gender-based street harassment, which it defines as "any action or comment between strangers in public places that is disrespectful, unwelcome, threatening and/or harassing and is motivated by gender or sexual orientation."\par \par \uc2 Recently, the Washington Area Bicyclist Association (WABA) partnered with Collective Action for Safe Spaces (CASS) in the District to give cyclists a safe place to vent and discuss harassment prevention and empowerment strategies, said Nelle Pierson, WABA's coordinator of outreach programs.\par \par \uc2 "A lot of women start biking because it is empowering, but also because they can just get away from a situation," said Zosia Sztykowski, 28, of Columbia Heights, the lead outreach coordinator for CASS, a grass-roots organization dedicated to building awareness and ending sexual assault and harassment on the streets. The organization produces a blog that curates women's experiences with street harassment. "A lot of people think street harassment happens just to them and that they're alone," she said.\par \par \uc2 Workshop participants were asked in an online survey about their experiences with street harassment and public transportation. "The most frequent type of street harassment seems to be having someone from a car or sidewalk shout rude and disrespectful things at you," whether the victim's on a bike or a pedestrian, one person said. A CASS study in May found that 90 percent of women and members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community had experienced some form of harassment while biking.\par \par \uc2 Bikers shared anecdotes about harassment, their stories ranging from being shouted at to being followed by motorists.\par \par \uc2 Last year, Liz Gorman, 26, of Adams Morgan was walking in Dupont Circle when she was groped by a man later identified as Oscar Mauricio Cornejo-Pena, who police learned regularly rode his bicycle through the District and sexually assaulted women. Gorman wrote a blog post about the incident, which led to a police investigation. The Washington Post republished Gorman's post and wrote a series of articles about Cornejo-Pena, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Nicaragua.\par \par \uc2 Although Gorman's blog post brought Cornejo-Pena to the attention of authorities, her case was not one of the four counts of misdemeanor sex abuse he was charged with; she didn't see his face.\par \par \uc2 Cornejo-Pena was arrested and later deported, but that doesn't mean Gorman is no longer fearful when she walks or bikes.\par \par \uc2 "I've also dealt with harassment as a bicyclist, by both pedestrians and men in cars," said Gorman. "I am actually surprised on days that it doesn't happen."\par \par \uc2 Workshop participants also learned about ways to respond to harassers. "There is no wrong way to respond to harassment, and no magic bullet, but if you respond in a way that is authentic to you, that is a good thing," said Julie Strange of CASS.\par \par \uc2 CASS's techniques are adapted from the 1993 book "Back Off: How to Confront and Stop Sexual Harassment and Harassers" by Martha Langelan, an activist, self-defense expert and former president of the D.C. Rape Crisis Center. In the 1980s, the rape crisis center was an integral part of a campaign to turn the District into a "hassle-free zone" by educating residents about the dangers of public sexual harassment.\par \par \uc2 Sztykowski said there are several methods to engage the harasser, including employing a response such as: "Stop harassing people. I don't like it. No one likes it. Show some respect."\par \par \uc2 One of the workshop participants worried that she would laugh under the pressure of confronting a perpetrator - a nervous habit - or would face reproach and be the target of a slur. Sztykowski and Strange said those fears may be rooted in women having been socialized to be "nice."\par \par \uc2 Strange also pointed out that women have been taught to "protect themselves from being victimized." She said that point of view is problematic because it places the onus of prevention on the victim. The goal now is to focus on the perpetrator to change the behavior.\par \par \uc2 Bystanders can help by confronting or distracting the perpetrator or seeking help from law enforcement on the victim's behalf. Often, bystanders avoid getting involved because they worry that they have misread the situation, think someone else will step in to help or believe that the target attracted the negative attention due to some fault of his or her own, according to Strange.\par \par \uc2 Strange said bystander intervention can be proactive - for example, confronting a friend who makes an abusive or offensive comment.\par \par \uc2 A few of the participants liked the idea of placing the shame back on the harasser with a comment like: "When you comment on my body, it makes me barf." Another participant suggested using the clinical terms for body parts. In her experience, the word "vagina" makes harassers especially uncomfortable.\par \par \uc2 Mount Pleasant resident Cristina Huidobro, who moved to the D.C. area four years ago to attend the \uc2 University of Maryland\uc2 , found out about the workshop from her WABA newsletter. She said she had become desensitized to public harassment in her home country, Chile, because it was so frequent, and she was not aware that it was considered to be such a pressing issue here.\par \par \uc2 Hearing other women voice their aversion to harassment changed her mind.\par \par \uc2 "Some things may not bother me, but they bother other women. I have to respect that and support them," she said.\par \par \uc2 McEwen is a former correspondent for the Stop Street Harassment blog. \par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com\par \par \uc2 WP20131201commuter1201\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020131201e9c10003e\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

D.C. area groups teach empowerment tactics.; Apart from motorists\u8217\'20\'19 road rage and scant bicycle lanes, women cyclists face public sexual harassment.\b0\par\par\uc2 By Lauren McEwen;Michael Livingston II   \par \uc2 1,133 \uc2 words\par \uc2 30 November 2013\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2013, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Bicyclists face numerous dangers as they struggle to share already congested roads with drivers. In the United States, a cyclist is killed every 12.6\u160\'00\'A0hours.\par \par \uc2 But for gay men, women and transgender bikers, the dangers can be compounded by harassment and the threat of assault.\par \par \uc2 For Kate, a 28-year-old cycling enthusiast, summer is always the worst. Pedestrians feel free to yell what they perceive as compliments: "Yeah, you look good!" or "Can I ride with you?"\par \par \uc2 "As a woman, I'm constantly operating with the low-level fear that any man might attack me," said Kate, a resident of the Brookland neighborhood in Northeast Washington, who asked that her last name not be used because of safety concerns.\par \par \uc2 Once, a male cyclist pulled up alongside her on the C&O Canal towpath, presumably thinking she wanted company. He asked her to stop because he needed to urinate \u8212\'20\'14 not in the bushes, but on the trail, exposing himself for anyone to see. She sped away, but he chased her down. He asked her out; she declined.\par \par \uc2 Stop Street Harassment, an international nonprofit organization, works to combat gender-based street harassment, which it defines as "any action or comment between strangers in public places that is disrespectful, unwelcome, threatening and/or harassing and is motivated by gender or sexual orientation."\par \par \uc2 Recently, the Washington Area Bicyclist Association partnered with Collective Action for Safe Spaces (CASS) in the District to give cyclists a safe place to vent and discuss harassment prevention and empowerment strategies, said Nelle Pierson, WABA's coordinator of outreach programs.\par \par \uc2 "A lot of women start biking because it is empowering, but also because they can just get away from a situation," said Zosia Sztykowski, 28, of Columbia Heights, the lead outreach coordinator for CASS, a grassroots organization dedicated to building awareness and ending sexual assault and harassment on the streets. The organization produces a blog that curates women's experiences with street harassment. "A lot of people think street harassment happens just to them and that they're alone," she said.\par \par \uc2 Workshop participants were asked in an online survey about their experiences with street harassment and public transportation. "The most frequent type of street harassment seems to be having someone from a car or sidewalk shout rude and disrespectful things at you," whether the victim's on a bike or a pedestrian, one person said. A CASS study in May found that 90\u160\'00\'A0percent of women and members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community had experienced some form of harassment while biking.\par \par \uc2 Bikers shared anecdotes about harassment, their stories ranging from being shouted at to being followed by motorists.\par \par \uc2 Last year, Liz Gorman, 26, of Adams Morgan was walking in Dupont Circle when she was groped by a man later identified as Oscar Mauricio Cornejo-Pena, who police learned regularly rode his bicycle through the District and sexually assaulted women. Gorman wrote a blog post about the incident, which led to a police investigation. The Washington Post republished Gorman's post and wrote a series of articles about Cornejo-Pena, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Nicaragua.\par \par \uc2 Although Gorman's blog post brought Cornejo-Pena to the attention of authorities, her case was not one of the four counts of misdemeanor sex abuse he was charged with; she didn't see his face. Cornejo-Pena was arrested and later deported, but that doesn't mean Gorman is no longer fearful when she walks or bikes.\par \par \uc2 "I've also dealt with harassment as a bicyclist, by both pedestrians and men in cars," said Gorman. "I am actually surprised on days that it doesn't happen."\par \par \uc2 Workshop participants also learned about ways to respond to harassers. "There is no wrong way to respond to harassment, and no magic bullet, but if you respond in a way that is authentic to you, that is a good thing," said Julie Strange of CASS.\par \par \uc2 CASS's techniques are adapted from the 1993 book "Back Off: How to Confront and Stop Sexual Harassment and Harassers" by Martha Langelan, an activist, self-defense expert and former president of the D.C. Rape Crisis Center. In the 1980s, the rape crisis center was an integral part of a campaign to turn the District into a "hassle-free zone" by educating residents about the dangers of public sexual harassment.\par \par \uc2 Sztykowski said there are several methods to engage the harasser, including employing a response such as: "Stop harassing people. I don't like it. No one likes it. Show some respect."\par \par \uc2 One of the workshop participants worried that she would laugh under the pressure of confronting a perpetrator \u8212\'20\'14 a nervous habit \u8212\'20\'14 or would face reproach and be the target of a slur. Sztykowski and Strange said those fears may be rooted in women having been socialized to be "nice."\par \par \uc2 Strange also pointed out that women have been taught to "protect themselves from being victimized." She said that point of view is problematic because it places the onus of prevention on the victim. The goal now is to focus on the perpetrator to change the behavior.\par \par \uc2 Bystanders can help by confronting or distracting the perpetrator or seeking help from law enforcement on the victim's behalf. Often, bystanders avoid getting involved because they worry that they have misread the situation, think someone else will step in to help or believe that the target attracted the negative attention due to some fault of his or her own, according to Strange.\par \par \uc2 Strange said bystander intervention can be proactive \u8212\'20\'14 for example, confronting a friend who makes an abusive or offensive comment.\par \par \uc2 A few of the participants liked the idea of placing the shame back on the harasser with a comment like: "When you comment on my body, it makes me barf." Another participant suggested using the clinical terms for body parts. In her experience, the word "vagina" makes harassers especially uncomfortable.\par \par \uc2 Mount Pleasant resident Cristina Huidobro, who moved to the D.C. area four years ago to attend the \uc2 University of Maryland\uc2 , found out about the workshop from her WABA newsletter. She said she had become desensitized to public harassment in her home country, Chile, because it was so frequent, and she was not aware that it was considered to be such a pressing issue here.\par \par \uc2 Hearing other women voice their aversion to harassment changed her mind.\par \par \uc2 "Some things may not bother me, but they bother other women. I have to respect that and support them," she said.\par \par \uc2 lauren.mcewen@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 michael.livingston@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 McEwen is a former correspondent for the Stop Street Harassment blog.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020131130e9bu000p1\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 In the new Virginia, in parts of Prince William County where people have arrived from Fairfax and New Jersey and India and El Salvador, all to find yards for the kids and houses they could afford, there's a nightly ritual this time of year.\par \par \uc2 The TV is on, and tired parents are barely paying attention, but the ads are the same, hour after hour, and the images sink in: Two men running for governor slime each other in 30-second blasts of venom that speak about everything but what matters. There's nothing about what it's like to spend four hours a day commuting so your kids can go to good schools, or about what roads could be built so it might not suck an hour out of your Saturday to go to the dry cleaner, or about how to lure jobs to Prince William so you don't have to haul out to Tysons or into the District five times a week.\par \par \uc2 These are the voters who will decide who is elected governor Tuesday. Many of them don't follow politics closely, but they know enough to be annoyed. They're people like Julie Gloster, a single mother of three, a widow at 30 who can't get over how politicians refuse to work together, even when it hurts Americans.\par \par \uc2 "You can't always win, sometimes you have to lose," she said. "Sometimes, you turn on the news and everything upsets you." She'll vote for Terry McAuliffe, the Democrat.\par \par \uc2 And they're people like David DePerro, an IT guy who is trying to make it as a screenwriter, who sees his neighbors' lives paralyzed by traffic and wonders why "I don't hear anybody talking about transportation in this race. How can that be?" He's voting for Ken Cuccinelli II, the Republican, whom he knows from church and considers honest and principled.\par \par \uc2 A couple of decades ago, Prince William was relatively insignificant to politicians in Richmond or Washington \u8212\'20\'14 a rural outpost that supplied milk and meat to the D.C. area, a reliably Republican place with not many voters. Now, this is one of the most vital spots on any political map.\par \par \uc2 It's where President Obama started and ended his 2012 campaign. It's where Cuccinelli moved after his Fairfax County district became more Democratic. In his part of the county, in Nokesville, he got more space, an easier commute to his job as attorney general in Richmond, and a welcoming community of conservative churchgoers.\par \par \uc2 Five miles north, in the Haymarket precinct, the new townhouse developments are filled with transplants and immigrants, young singles and new parents, Christians and Muslims. Prince William is home to 430,000 residents, and, according to the Census Bureau, it's been growing lately at more than double Virginia's 2percent growth rate. Incomes have been climbing, too; the median household level is now $94,000, 50 percent higher than statewide.\par \par \uc2 All that growth has shifted the county's political complexion, turning it from the last conservative stronghold in Northern Virginia \u8212\'20\'14 Prince William won national attention for its 2007 crackdown on illegal immigrants \u8212\'20\'14 into a remarkably accurate bellwether for a changing state. The county voted for Obama, twice, and for Gov. Robert F. McDonnell (R), and for President \uc2 George W. Bush\uc2 , twice.\par \par \uc2 Prince William became a \u173\'00\'ADmajority-minority county a few years ago; its non-Hispanic white population has shrunk to 47 percent. Hispanics are the next largest group, at 21 percent, followed by African Americans at 20 percent and Asians at 8 percent. More than 21 percent are foreign born, almost double the proportion in the rest of Virginia.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18I don\u8217\'20\'19t have a good job\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 Navdeep Kaur, 34, who immigrated to Virginia from India about 15 years ago, lives in a three-story brick townhouse in a section of the Haymarket precinct just north of Interstate 66. She and her husband, Manjit Singh, 40 \u8212\'20\'14 theirs was an arranged marriage \u8212\'20\'14 lived in Alexandria at first but moved to Prince William for safer neighborhoods and more attention at school for their two children.\par \par \uc2 "If you don't have a complete education, you can't have a good job," she said. "So I don't have a good job." She works part time in a county public school's cafeteria; her husband delivers newspapers in the mornings and pizzas in the evenings.\par \par \uc2 Kaur's job allows her to be home with her children after school and over the summer \u8212\'20\'14 but it does not provide health insurance she can afford. (The plan costs at least $400 a month.) So when Kaur and her daughter suffered neck pain after a car accident, the family paid $2,000 to see a doctor. Even a simple sinus infection recently cost $150.\par \par \uc2 "I pay cash; it's very hard," she said. "Sometimes you don't have cash, and you have to put it on a credit card."\par \par \uc2 When the Affordable Care Act was enacted, Kaur excitedly called her relatives around the world.\par \par \uc2 Since becoming a U.S. citizen six years ago, she has voted for Democrats because "they know the middle class. Republicans are all rich. They don't understand the middle class."\par \par \uc2 She doesn't know much about the candidates for governor but was impressed to get mail last week from someone she admires. "Michelle Obama sent me a letter," she said. "I love Michelle Obama." Kaur will vote for McAuliffe on Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 When Muneer Baig came to America from India 25 years ago, he found a political home in the Republican Party. He and his wife home-school their five children, and he appreciates the party's devotion to school choice. A computer consultant, he has always liked how his party stands up for business.\par \par \uc2 "But over the last four or five years, I looked at my party and every single opportunity they got, somehow the Muslims were bad," said Baig, whose family is Muslim and lives in a development of large homes south of Manassas. "People who come to this country leave everything behind and want to devote everything to our new home. My neighbors are my life, and then I'm told by these politicians, 'You don't belong here.'\u8200\'20\'08"\par \par \uc2 Prince William's immigration ordinance initially required police to check the status of anyone they detained who they thought might be an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . Thousands of immigrants left the county in response to the enforcement drive. For those in Virginia legally who stayed in Prince William, "it still feels like we are being painted as evil or suspect," Baig says. "I was sad to see my party behind this, becoming just the party of no, no, no."\par \par \uc2 Baig is no fan of McAuliffe, whom he sees as a wheeler-dealer, but he views Cuccinelli as an extremist on social issues and immigration. "McAuliffe's black spots affect his own life," he said. "Cuccinelli's dark spots directly affect me." Baig will vote for McAuliffe.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18Here for the same things\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 Near the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, the county's Haymarket precinct is home to the last burst of development east of the rural preserve that the county has created to maintain its farm economy.\par \par \uc2 The precinct includes the historic downtown, with its federal-style houses and old town hall, and a fast-growing jumble of big-box stores, estate houses on large lots, and townhouse communities with long lines of nearly identical houses, many of which are priced at less than $300,000. Voters here gave Obama majorities in 2008 and again in 2012; immediately to the west, precincts in the agricultural zone gave \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2  his biggest wins in the county last year, with some areas going 2-to-1 for the Republican.\par \par \uc2 As school buses dropped students off just outside Haymarket one afternoon last week, two mothers chatted in Spanish, then switched to English when another friend walked up. An Indian mother arranged to borrow a ladder from a neighbor.\par \par \uc2 "There is a tension sometimes," said Donna Widawski, 53, a retired Secret Service agent who grew up in Arlington County and found that in Haymarket, she could get a house with a view of mountains, a lake and a golf course. Her community has attracted immigrants from Asia and Latin America, and she says neighbors get along well, but as a Republican, she also knows that many of her foreign-born neighbors think her party opposes their presence.\par \par \uc2 "We all came out here for the same things, the schools and the bucolic setting," Widawski said. And many of her neighbors left Arlington and Fairfax to get away from high taxes and high prices.\par \par \uc2 So she figures they're all natural Republicans \u8212\'20\'14 "except that we need to do a better job of countering that narrative about immigration. I myself am the wife, daughter and granddaughter of immigrants. Republicans need to tell people that we are the party that if you work hard, you'll succeed. A lot of them are Democrats because they've been promised gifts \u8212\'20\'14 immigration reform, Medicaid expansion, benefits."\par \par \uc2 Widawski will vote for Cuccinelli, mainly because she thinks he will fight for family values and against raising taxes.\par \par \uc2 In his five years in the county, DePerro, 41, has seen the influx from Fairfax and beyond bang up against the quieter, cheaper life that attracted many newcomers in the first place. There are conflicts over land use, traffic and taxes, and, in each case, DePerro sees a relentless slide toward the kind of conditions that led many new residents to leave their former homes.\par \par \uc2 "I don't want to see this area turn into California or New York," he said, "with all that debt and taxes. This is the exurbs, where people come because they can't afford enough house in Arlington or Fairfax."\par \par \uc2 DePerro thinks the way to hold the line is to keep taxes low and government small. So he will vote for Cuccinelli, even though "he's got bigger fish to fry now \u8212\'20\'14 the health-care thing." DePerro doesn't have insurance and doesn't want anyone telling him he has to get it, so he's grateful for Cuccinelli's strong stance against the health-care law.\par \par \uc2 Gloster, who lives in a three-story brick townhouse near Haymarket, has also been thinking about health care, and the other ways government helps those who have hit rough patches. When Gloster's husband died suddenly last year, she had to support her three children, ages 13, 5 and 2, on her salary as a production manager at a mortgage company.\par \par \uc2 She works hard and doesn't like depending on anyone else, but a few years back, when she lost a job and her health insurance and her daughter got sick, Medicaid covered that cost. Now she is receiving Social Security survivors benefits.\par \par \uc2 "I need it, and I use it for them," Gloster said, nodding toward her children. "I'm using the system the way I'm supposed to, and I'm just grateful. I'm so grateful."\par \par \uc2 She's willing to pay a little more in taxes to ensure that such protections are there for others. "Sometimes when you've got a little to give, you have to, because it all evens out in the end," she said.\par \par \uc2 Her job has been demanding lately, so she hasn't focused on anything but work and kids. But she always makes it a point to vote.\par \par \uc2 She will vote for McAuliffe and the other Democrats on the ballot, because she thinks they'll push for better schools, because they don't rail against paying for benefits that people sometimes need, and because she has no patience for politicians who want government to decide whether women have access to birth control and abortion.\par \par \uc2 "I have the right to make my own decisions," she said. "Nobody is going to tell me what I can and cannot do."\par \par \uc2 marc.fisher@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 jenna.johnson@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 Justin Jouvenal and Carol Morello contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020131104e9b300001\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved   \par \par \uc2 In the new Virginia, in parts of Prince William County where people have arrived from Fairfax and New Jersey and India and El Salvador, all to find yards for the kids and houses they could afford, there's a nightly ritual this time of year.\par \par \uc2 The TV is on, and tired parents are barely paying attention, but the ads are the same, hour after hour, and the images sink in: Two men running for governor slime each other in 30-second blasts of venom that speak about everything but what matters. There's nothing about what it's like to spend four hours a day commuting so your kids can go to good schools, or about what roads could be built so it might not suck an hour out of your Saturday to go to the dry cleaner, or about how to lure jobs to Prince William so you don't have to haul out to Tysons or into the District five times a week.\par \par \uc2 These are the voters who will decide who is elected governor Tuesday. Many of them don't follow politics closely, but they know enough to be annoyed. They're people like Julie Gloster, a single mother of three, a widow at 30 who can't get over how politicians refuse to work together, even when it hurts Americans.\par \par \uc2 "You can't always win, sometimes you have to lose," she said. "Sometimes, you turn on the news and everything upsets you." She'll vote for Terry McAuliffe, the Democrat.\par \par \uc2 And they're people like David DePerro, an IT guy who is trying to make it as a screenwriter, who sees his neighbors' lives paralyzed by traffic and wonders why "I don't hear anybody talking about transportation in this race. How can that be?" He's voting for Ken Cuccinelli II, the Republican, whom he knows from church and considers honest and principled.\par \par \uc2 A couple of decades ago, Prince William was relatively insignificant to politicians in Richmond or Washington - a rural outpost that supplied milk and meat to the D.C. area, a reliably Republican place with not many voters. Now, this is one of the most vital spots on any political map.\par \par \uc2 It's where President Obama started and ended his 2012 campaign. It's where Cuccinelli moved after his Fairfax County district became more Democratic. In his part of the county, in Nokesville, he got more space, an easier commute to his job as attorney general in Richmond, and a welcoming community of conservative churchgoers.\par \par \uc2 Five miles north, in the Haymarket precinct, the new townhouse developments are filled with transplants and immigrants, young singles and new parents, Christians and Muslims. Prince William is home to 430,000 residents, and, according to the Census Bureau, it's been growing lately at more than double Virginia's 2 percent growth rate. Incomes have been climbing, too; the median household level is now $94,000, 50 percent higher than statewide.\par \par \uc2 All that growth has shifted the county's political complexion, turning it from the last conservative stronghold in Northern Virginia - Prince William won national attention for its 2007 crackdown on illegal immigrants - into a remarkably accurate bellwether for a changing state. The county voted for Obama, twice, and for Gov. Robert F. McDonnell (R), and for President \uc2 George W. Bush\uc2 , twice.\par \par \uc2 Prince William became a majority-minority county a few years ago; its non-Hispanic white population has shrunk to 47 percent. Hispanics are the next largest group, at 21 percent, followed by African Americans at 20 percent and Asians at 8 percent. More than 21 percent are foreign born, almost double the proportion in the rest of Virginia.\par \par \uc2 Navdeep Kaur, 34, who immigrated to Virginia from India about 15 years ago, lives in a three-story brick townhouse in a section of the Haymarket precinct just north of Interstate 66. She and her husband, Manjit Singh, 40 - theirs was an arranged marriage - lived in Alexandria at first but moved to Prince William for safer neighborhoods and more attention at school for their two children.\par \par \uc2 "If you don't have a complete education, you can't have a good job," she said. "So I don't have a good job." She works part time in a county public school's cafeteria; her husband delivers newspapers in the mornings and pizzas in the evenings.\par \par \uc2 Kaur's job allows her to be home with her children after school and over the summer - but it does not provide health insurance she can afford. (The plan costs at least $400 a month.) So when Kaur and her daughter suffered neck pain after a car accident, the family paid $2,000 to see a doctor. Even a simple sinus infection recently cost $150.\par \par \uc2 "I pay cash; it's very hard," she said. "Sometimes you don't have cash, and you have to put it on a credit card."\par \par \uc2 When the Affordable Care Act was enacted, Kaur excitedly called her relatives around the world.\par \par \uc2 Since becoming a U.S. citizen six years ago, she has voted for Democrats because "they know the middle class. Republicans are all rich. They don't understand the middle class."\par \par \uc2 She doesn't know much about the candidates for governor but was impressed to get mail last week from someone she admires. "Michelle Obama sent me a letter," she said. "I love Michelle Obama." Kaur will vote for McAuliffe on Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 When Muneer Baig came to America from India 25 years ago, he found a political home in the Republican Party. He and his wife home-school their five children, and he appreciates the party's devotion to school choice. A computer consultant, he has always liked how his party stands up for business.\par \par \uc2 "But over the last four or five years, I looked at my party and every single opportunity they got, somehow the Muslims were bad," said Baig, whose family is Muslim and lives in a development of large homes south of Manassas. "People who come to this country leave everything behind and want to devote everything to our new home. My neighbors are my life, and then I'm told by these politicians, 'You don't belong here.'\u710\'02\'C6"\par \par \uc2 Prince William's immigration ordinance initially required police to check the status of anyone they detained who they thought might be an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . Thousands of immigrants left the county in response to the enforcement drive. For those in Virginia legally who stayed in Prince William, "it still feels like we are being painted as evil or suspect," Baig says. "I was sad to see my party behind this, becoming just the party of no, no, no."\par \par \uc2 Baig is no fan of McAuliffe, whom he sees as a wheeler-dealer, but he views Cuccinelli as an extremist on social issues and immigration. "McAuliffe's black spots affect his own life," he said. "Cuccinelli's dark spots directly affect me." Baig will vote for McAuliffe.\par \par \uc2 Near the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, the county's Haymarket precinct is home to the last burst of development east of the rural preserve that the county has created to maintain its farm economy.\par \par \uc2 The precinct includes the historic downtown, with its federal-style houses and old town hall, and a fast-growing jumble of big-box stores, estate houses on large lots, and townhouse communities with long lines of nearly identical houses, many of which are priced at less than $300,000. Voters here gave Obama majorities in 2008 and again in 2012; immediately to the west, precincts in the agricultural zone gave \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2  his biggest wins in the county last year, with some areas going 2-to-1 for the Republican.\par \par \uc2 As school buses dropped students off just outside Haymarket one afternoon last week, two mothers chatted in Spanish, then switched to English when another friend walked up. An Indian mother arranged to borrow a ladder from a neighbor.\par \par \uc2 "There is a tension sometimes," said Donna Widawski, 53, a retired Secret Service agent who grew up in Arlington County and found that in Haymarket, she could get a house with a view of mountains, a lake and a golf course. Her community has attracted immigrants from Asia and Latin America, and she says neighbors get along well, but as a Republican, she also knows that many of her foreign-born neighbors think her party opposes their presence.\par \par \uc2 "We all came out here for the same things, the schools and the bucolic setting," Widawski said. And many of her neighbors left Arlington and Fairfax to get away from high taxes and high prices.\par \par \uc2 So she figures they're all natural Republicans - "except that we need to do a better job of countering that narrative about immigration. I myself am the wife, daughter and granddaughter of immigrants. Republicans need to tell people that we are the party that if you work hard, you'll succeed. A lot of them are Democrats because they've been promised gifts - immigration reform, Medicaid expansion, benefits."\par \par \uc2 Widawski will vote for Cuccinelli, mainly because she thinks he will fight for family values and against raising taxes.\par \par \uc2 In his five years in the county, DePerro, 41, has seen the influx from Fairfax and beyond bang up against the quieter, cheaper life that attracted many newcomers in the first place. There are conflicts over land use, traffic and taxes, and, in each case, DePerro sees a relentless slide toward the kind of conditions that led many new residents to leave their former homes.\par \par \uc2 "I don't want to see this area turn into California or New York," he said, "with all that debt and taxes. This is the exurbs, where people come because they can't afford enough house in Arlington or Fairfax."\par \par \uc2 DePerro thinks the way to hold the line is to keep taxes low and government small. So he will vote for Cuccinelli, even though "he's got bigger fish to fry now - the health-care thing." DePerro doesn't have insurance and doesn't want anyone telling him he has to get it, so he's grateful for Cuccinelli's strong stance against the health-care law.\par \par \uc2 Gloster, who lives in a three-story brick townhouse near Haymarket, has also been thinking about health care, and the other ways government helps those who have hit rough patches. When Gloster's husband died suddenly last year, she had to support her three children, ages 13, 5 and 2, on her salary as a production manager at a mortgage company.\par \par \uc2 She works hard and doesn't like depending on anyone else, but a few years back, when she lost a job and her health insurance and her daughter got sick, Medicaid covered that cost. Now she is receiving Social Security survivors benefits.\par \par \uc2 "I need it, and I use it for them," Gloster said, nodding toward her children. "I'm using the system the way I'm supposed to, and I'm just grateful. I'm so grateful."\par \par \uc2 She's willing to pay a little more in taxes to ensure that such protections are there for others. "Sometimes when you've got a little to give, you have to, because it all evens out in the end," she said.\par \par \uc2 Her job has been demanding lately, so she hasn't focused on anything but work and kids. But she always makes it a point to vote.\par \par \uc2 She will vote for McAuliffe and the other Democrats on the ballot, because she thinks they'll push for better schools, because they don't rail against paying for benefits that people sometimes need, and because she has no patience for politicians who want government to decide whether women have access to birth control and abortion.\par \par \uc2 "I have the right to make my own decisions," she said. "Nobody is going to tell me what I can and cannot do."\par \par \uc2 Justin Jouvenal and Carol Morello contributed to this report. \par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com\par \par \uc2 WP20131104voters1104\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020131104e9b40000p\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved   \par \par \uc2 An antiwar protest display that has been a fixture outside the White House for more than three decades was removed early Sunday after a volunteer abandoned watch during the night.\par \par \uc2 Activist Concepcion Picciotto, 77, and volunteers from the Peace House, a group dedicated to peace efforts in the District, spent the morning hours trying to figure out how to quickly recover and rebuild the display.\par \par \uc2 Lawyer Ann Wilcox, who represents Picciotto and works with the Peace House, said the U.S. Park Police apparently seized the protest materials after the volunteer walked away. When another volunteer showed up to work the morning shift, the vigil was gone.\par \par \uc2 "It has to be continually attended. Someone has to be there. Otherwise it can be seized," said Wilcox, referring to the laws that regulate protest efforts. "We will see what we can do. Obviously we want to reclaim it, recover it and have a better support system."\par \par \uc2 A similar situation happened last month when another volunteer abandoned the protest, Wilcox said.\par \par \uc2 A spokesman for the U.S. Park Police did not return a request for comment.\par \par \uc2 Last month, the vigil's disappearance swiftly gained attention from the White House press corps, and stories about the missing display made national news.\par \par \uc2 A shooting in Gaithersburg injured two people Saturday night, Montgomery County police said Sunday.\par \par \uc2 The shooting occurred about 10:30 p.m. in the 7700 block of Prince Hall Court, a police spokesman said. The location is near the Flower Hill Shopping Center.\par \par \uc2 One victim was injured in the leg, and the other in the hip, the spokesman said. The injuries are not considered life-threatening, he said. No details of the incident were released.\par \par \uc2 No arrests have been made in the case.\par \par \uc2 A 17-year-old died Sunday from injuries suffered during a shooting Friday morning in Reston, Fairfax County police said.\par \par \uc2 Detectives were still investigating whether the shooting of Juan Carlos Godoy in the 2200 block of Marginella Drive was an accident, police said in a news release.\par \par \uc2 They have charged Javier DeJesus Martinez, 26, with illegal possession of a firearm by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , authorities said.\par \par \uc2 DeJesus was an acquaintance of Godoy's, police said.\par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com\par \par \uc2 WP20131021regbriefs1021\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020131021e9al0000t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 THE DISTRICT\par \par \uc2 Antiwar display removed again\par \par \uc2 An antiwar protest display that has been a fixture outside the White House for more than three decades was removed early Sunday after a volunteer abandoned watch during the night.\par \par \uc2 Activist Concepcion Picciotto, 77, and volunteers from the Peace House, a group dedicated to peace efforts in the District, spent the morning hours trying to figure out how to quickly recover and rebuild the display.\par \par \uc2 Lawyer Ann Wilcox, who represents Picciotto and works with the Peace House, said the U.S. Park Police apparently seized the protest materials after the volunteer walked away. When another volunteer showed up to work the morning shift, the vigil was gone.\par \par \uc2 "It has to be continually attended. Someone has to be there. Otherwise it can be seized," said Wilcox, referring to the laws that regulate protest efforts. "We will see what we can do. Obviously we want to reclaim it, recover it and have a better support system."\par \par \uc2 A similar situation happened last month when another volunteer abandoned the protest, Wilcox said.\par \par \uc2 A spokesman for the U.S. Park Police did not return a request for comment.\par \par \uc2 Last month, the vigil's disappearance swiftly gained attention from the White House press corps, and stories about the missing display made national news.\par \par \uc2 MARYLAND\par \par \uc2 Shooting injures 2in Gaithersburg\par \par \uc2 A shooting in Gaithersburg injured two people Saturday night, Montgomery County police said Sunday.\par \par \uc2 The shooting occurred about 10:30 p.m. in the 7700 block of Prince Hall Court, a police spokesman said. The location is near the Flower Hill Shopping Center.\par \par \uc2 One victim was injured in the leg, and the other in the hip, the spokesman said. The injuries are not considered life-threatening, he said. No details of the incident were released.\par \par \uc2 No arrests have been made in the case.\par \par \uc2 VIRGINIA\par \par \uc2 Teen dies fromshooting injuries\par \par \uc2 A 17-year-old died Sunday from injuries sustained during a shooting Friday morning in Reston, Fairfax County police said.\par \par \uc2 Detectives were still investigating whether the shooting of Juan Carlos Godoy in the 2200 block of Marginella Drive was an accident, police said in a news release.\par \par \uc2 They have charged Javier DeJesus Martinez, 26, with illegal possession of a firearm by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , authorities said.\par \par \uc2 DeJesus was an acquaintance of Godoy's, police said.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020131020e9ak0058y\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved   \par \par \uc2 Two Turkish pilots held hostage in Lebanon and nine Lebanese pilgrims abducted in Syria returned home Saturday night, part of an ambitious three-way deal cutting across the Syrian civil war.\par \par \uc2 The Shiite pilgrims, some in dress shirts and others in suit jackets, embraced well-wishers at Beirut's international airport. Meanwhile, a plane carrying the two freed \uc2 Turkish Airlines\uc2  pilots landed in Istanbul, where Prime Minister \uc2 Recep Tayyip Erdogan\uc2  and other officials greeted them.\par \par \uc2 The double release came as part of a negotiated hostage deal that includes the freeing of dozens of women held in Syrian government jails. It wasn't immediately clear whether any of the women had been released.\par \par \uc2 Lebanese, Turkish and Syrian officials declined to provide more details of the complicated multilateral exchange. The deal appeared to have been mediated mostly by Qatar, which has supported Syrian rebels against the government of President Bashar al-Assad. Palestinian officials also mediated.\par \par \uc2 The nine Shiite pilgrims were kidnapped in May 2012 while on their way from Iran to Lebanon. The \uc2 Turkish Airlines\uc2  pilots had been held since they were kidnapped in Lebanon in August by Shiites hoping to pressure Turkey to help free the pilgrims.\par \par \uc2 Syrian rebels using a car bomb blew up an army checkpoint outside Damascus on Saturday, and more than 30 combatants from both sides died in the blast and ensuing clashes, a monitoring group said.\par \par \uc2 The pro-opposition \uc2 Syrian Observatory for Human Rights\uc2  said 15 rebels and at least 16 soldiers were killed.\par \par \uc2 Elsewhere near the capital, Syrian forces tried to storm the suburb of Moadamiya, which the army has blockaded for months, causing a spate of deaths from hunger and malnutrition.\par \par \uc2 The Britain-based Observatory said the checkpoint explosion, near Mleiha and Jaramana, was detonated by a suicide bomber from the al Qaeda-linked group Jabhat al-Nusra.\par \par \uc2 Expelled Roma girl can return to France, alone: Under fire from the far left and members of his Socialist Party, French President Franois Hollande said that a 15-year-old girl who was detained in front of her classmates and expelled as an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  can return to France but that her family cannot come with her. Leonarda Dibrani, however, said she would not return without her family, who are Roma, or Gypsies.\par \par \uc2 Hamas\uc2  leader calls for a renewed uprising against Israel: Hamas Prime Minister \uc2 Ismail Haniyeh\uc2 , in a speech in Gaza City, urged all Palestinian factions to oppose the recently restarted peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians, and take up "armed resistance." Israel, which the Islamist group does not recognize, is negotiating with the West Bank government of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. Israel recently discovered a pair of tunnels from Gaza that it says were intended to facilitate attacks.\par \par \uc2 At least 16 killed in suicide blast in Somali cafe: A suicide bomber killed at least 16 people in an attack on a cafe in a Somali town close to the Ethiopian border that is frequented by local and foreign soldiers fighting al-Qaeda-linked rebels. The Islamist militant group al-Shabab said it had carried out the bombing in the town of Beledweyne, targeting troops participating in an \uc2 African Union\uc2  peacekeeping force.\par \par \uc2 Italian protesters take aim at Finance Ministry: Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched in Rome against cuts to welfare programs and a shortage of low-income housing. Some hooded demonstrators who infiltrated a mostly peaceful protest threw smoke bombs, eggs and bottles at the Finance Ministry. More than 4,000 riot police were dispatched to maintain order, and 11 people were detained.\par \par \uc2 Skydivers' plane crashes in Belgium, killing 11: A plane carrying parachutists for a skydiving trip crashed in southern Belgium, killing all 11 people aboard, officials said. Minutes after the aircraft took off from a small airfield near the city of Namur, witnesses saw part of a wing break off, sending the plane into a spiraling nose dive.\par \par \uc2 Argentine train crashes into station, again: An Argentine commuter train slammed into the end of the line Saturday at the same station in Buenos Aires where 52 people were killed in a similar crash last year. There was no immediate report of deaths, but at least 80 people were injured.\par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com\par \par \uc2 WP20131020foreign1020\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020131020e9ak0007c\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

The incident could have turned fatal, a fire official said. But Prince George's County police officers arrived in time to put the blaze out, and firefighters soon removed the driver from the car with injuries not believed to be life-threatening, the official said.\par \par \uc2 "Putting out that fire probably had a marked difference in saving this guy's life," said Mark Brady, a spokesman for the Prince George's County Fire/EMS Department. "Apparently there was enough damage to the vehicle that prevented him from getting out."\par \par \uc2 The incident began about 12:30 a.m., Brady said, when an SUV left the roadway and crashed into a pump at a gas station in the 6100 block of Oxon Hill Road.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 VIRGINIA ATTORNEY General Ken Cuccinelli II, the Republican candidate for governor, has been trying to scrub his \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 -bashing past, which appears badly out of sync with the views of most Virginians, according to polls. As The Post's \uc2 David Nakamura\uc2  reported, all mention of immigration was dropped from the candidate's Web site in the spring.\par \par \uc2 That's a sharp departure from Mr. Cuccinelli's passionate stance on the issue as a state lawmaker and as attorney general. At various times, he has led the charges to deny citizenship to the \u173\'00\'ADAmerican-born children of illegal immigrants; to authorize lawsuits against employers who would hire illegal immigrants; to prevent undocumented students, even if they grew up in Virginia, from qualifying for in-state tuition at public colleges and universities; and even to block legal immigrant workers from collecting unemployment benefits if they are fired for not speaking English on the job.\par \par \uc2 "It is beyond debate that these people do not have the right to be in this country," he wrote, referring to illegal immigrants, while running for attorney general four years ago. Today, more than two-thirds of Virginians support eventual citizenship for most illegal immigrants, according to a survey conducted in the spring by Harper Polling, a Republican firm.\par \par \uc2 In the past, Mr. Cuccinelli has trumpeted most of those stances on the Web sites he maintained as a state senator, as a candidate for attorney general and as attorney general. Now, his allies insist that immigration is hardly a state issue at all \u8212\'20\'14 despite the copious legislation that Mr. Cuccinelli and other conservatives sponsored and voted for \u8212\'20\'14 and that critics are unfairly maligning him on the issue.\par \par \uc2 Immigration is one of a number of subjects where Mr. Cuccinelli has made ample use of editing to play down his record as a crusading social conservative \u8212\'20\'14 an effort he continued Wednesday in a debate with Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic gubernatorial candidate.\par \par \uc2 As attorney general, he tormented homosexuals, whom he once scorned as inviting "nothing but self-destruction, not only physically but of their soul." He tried energetically to preserve a law banning oral and anal sex, a measure long regarded as targeting homosexuals. Yet as a candidate for governor, he has cast his defense of Virginia's anti-sodomy law as an effort to shield children from predators. That's a stretch. And in Wednesday's debate, he said the suggestion that he had called gays "soulless" was "offensively false."\par \par \uc2 He has muted his longtime position doubting the science on climate change. On guns, although he has been a a steadfast advocate for expanding permission to carry concealed weapons (for example, on the campus of the \uc2 University of Virginia\uc2 ), he now says he understands that "many people have reasonable concerns about the misuse of firearms." He sponsored a state constitutional amendment granting protection to the "preborn" from "the moment of fertilization," which would have opened the way to challenges to common methods of birth control, including the pill and intrauterine devices. Now Mr. Cuccinelli insists he intended no such outcome.\par \par \uc2 It's not a bad thing that the general election has prompted Mr. Cuccinelli to move toward the center; if he is elected, many Virginians would hope he governs from there. Still, it's worth bearing in mind the considerable distance that Mr. Cuccinelli must move to reach the center \u8212\'20\'14 and the passion with which he has defended his views in the past.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020130926e99q007sl\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

He's just not going to do it this time. Instead, he's going to Congress to ask for permission he does not need.\par \par \uc2 The ambivalence towards the president's war powers hasn't left anyone particularly happy. Advocates of a more restrained executive wish Obama had gone to Congress from the start, and gone to Congress for authorization to attack Libya, and they wish Obama would stop saying that he has the authority to strike even if Congress rejects his plans. As for those who want to see the president's war-making powers preserved and even stretched, they're furious for all the obvious reasons.\par \par \uc2 But part of the danger is that President Obama's ambivalence towards the process on Syria appears to come from an ambivalence towards the policy on Syria. There is little enthusiasm inside the Obama administration for this strike, which is being carried out almost entirely for reasons of "credibility" and serves no larger purpose in protecting civilians or ending the conflict (indeed, it might make matters on-the-ground worse).\par \par \uc2 Which isn't to say the White House isn't aggressively lobbying for Congress's imprimatur. Obama's been personally pushing key lawmakers, and on Monday, secured the (tentative, conditional) support of Sen. \uc2 John McCain\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 But the sum result of the president's approach has been to sow confusion on and off the Hill. It appears to many in Congress that Obama has come to them less to receive their blessing than to spread the blame for an intervention he doesn't feel comfortable being solely responsible for. In this, the act of going to Congress -- or at least the way Obama went to Congress -- has weakened the case for going to war in Congress's eyes.\par \par \uc2 The irony now is that just as the best reasons for striking Syria are abstract, so too are many of the best reasons for Congress to back the president.\par \par \uc2 "If the Congress does support the President, it will only be after we have openly faltered, and after having rushed forward before deciding on a course of delay," writes Anthony Cordesman of the \uc2 Center for Strategic and International Studies\uc2 . "The President will have set a uniquely dangerous precedent by turning to Congress only after he appeared weak."\par \par \uc2 But "if the Congress does not support the President, or should split openly in front of the world, the message will be far worse. A bad set of signals to the world will become a near disaster. Doubts about the U.S. and this President will reach dangerous levels among both friend and foe, and our failure to deal with Syria will spillover into Asia, the Afghan conflict, Iran, and any effort to bring an Arab-Israel peace."\par \par \uc2 This, however, piles abstraction upon abstraction. President Obama feels the need to enter Syria not to solve a terrible conflict but to protect America's credibility and enforce international norms against chemical weapons. Congress might vote to enter Syria not because they believe the strikes make strategic or moral sense but because they feel the need to protect the president's credibility and quiet international doubts about the role America intends to play in the world going forward.\par \par \uc2 Missing on all counts is a strong belief that striking Syria is, on its own merits, a good idea.\par \par \uc2 Wonkbook's Number of the Day: 23. That, according to a Washington Post tally, is the current number of U.S. senators who have stated publicly that they favor a strike on Syria. 20 have said they do not.\par \par \uc2 Wonkbook's Graph of the Day: These two maps are incredibly important to Obamacare.\par \par \uc2 Wonkbook's Top 5 Stories: 1) Syria resolution in the works; 2) how is Labor doing; 3) the NSA is outdone; 4) the price of carbon; and 5) what they say on the border about immigration reform.\par \par \uc2 1) Top story: Your full top-of-the-week briefing on Syria\par \par \uc2 New Syria plan in Senate limits Obama. "Aides to Reid and Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) have set aside a proposed Syria resolution submitted by the White House on Saturday night. That draft resolution \u8212\'20\'14 developed without congressional input \u8212\'20\'14 is seen as far too broad by lawmakers in both parties Some of the options being considered for the revised Authorization for the Use of Military Force include a 60-day period for Obama to launch "narrow, limited" strikes against Assad's regime with the potential for a 30-day extension of that deadline. Language barring the insertion of U.S. ground troops \u8212\'20\'14 but crafted to allow special forces operations or the rescue of a downed American flier, for instance \u8212\'20\'14 is also being considered, the sources said. And Obama would be prohibited from making the toppling of Assad's government the goal of any U.S. military effort in Syria, as some some hawkish lawmakers have supported." John Bresnahan in Politico.\par \par \uc2 White House OK with changing language on Syria resolution. "As the Obama administration launched what it described as a "flood the zone" campaign to persuade Congress to authorize military action against Syria, officials said Monday that they are willing to rewrite the proposed resolution to clarify that any operation would be limited in scope and duration and would not include the use of ground troops. Their signal of flexibility came amid indications that Obama is picking up tentative, conditional support in what promises to be a difficult battle for approval of military strikes The administration's openness to negotiating new language for its proposed resolution is an attempt to address concerns, voiced on the left and the right, that the draft is too vague. Doing so would also put into writing some of the reassurances that Obama has offered in his statements." \uc2 Karen Tumulty\uc2  and Anne Gearan in The Washington Post.\par \par \uc2 @strobetalbott: While Congress debates Syria, US is already at war with North Waziristan a/k/a Talibanistan a/k/a AlQaedistan, #1 target zone for drones.\par \par \uc2 U.S. has not armed Syrian rebels. "In June, the White House authorized the \uc2 Central Intelligence Agency\uc2  to help arm moderate fighters battling the Assad regime, a signal to Syrian rebels that the cavalry was coming. Three months later, they are still waiting. The delay, in part, reflects a broader U.S. approach rarely discussed publicly but that underpins its decision-making, according to former and current U.S. officials: The Obama administration doesn't want to tip the balance in favor of the opposition for fear the outcome may be even worse for U.S. interests than the current stalemate." Adam Entous and Nour Malas in The Wall Street Journal.\par \par \uc2 Explainer: What to expect on Capitol Hill re: Syria this week. Ed O'Keefe in The Washington Post.\par \par \uc2 An early test for Obama's Syria push will come at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee panel. "President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 's political test over Syria begins Tuesday afternoon in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and the deep divides within that panel reflect the broader struggle on Capitol Hill over whether the U.S. should intervene militarily in Syria. Secretary of State John Kerry and Defense Secretary \uc2 Chuck Hagel\uc2  will appear before the panel to make Obama's case for "limited, narrow" strikes by U.S. forces in retaliation for Syrian President \uc2 Bashar Assad\uc2 's alleged use of chemical weapons against Syrian civilians When the Foreign Relations Committee will actually vote on the revised Syria resolution, and its exact wording, is still unclear. Senate Democratic aides said a panel vote may come later in the week with the resolution reaching the Senate floor by early next week." John Bresnahan in Politico.\par \par \uc2 @markknoller: Tomorrow's meeting part of the WH effort to win congressional support for bill authorizing use of force against Syria.\par \par \uc2 Whip count: Where the votes stand on Syria. "As the debate unfolds over the next week-plus, The Fix will be keeping a close eye on the vote count and whether Congress will sign off on the so-called "use of force" resolution. Below are our whip counts for both the House and Senate, based on public statements made by each member. The graphic includes all 100 senators and will include all House members once they all weigh in publicly. [Senate is so far 23-20-57, for-against-undecided. House is 16-98-90.]" \uc2 Aaron Blake\uc2  in The Washington Post.\par \par \uc2 Sen. McCain meets with Obama on Syria. ""A rejection of this resolution would be catastrophic, not just for him but for the institution of the presidency and the credibility of the United States," McCain said after meeting with President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  "I'm already talking to a lot of my colleagues, but before I can persuade them to support this, I have to be persuaded," McCain said. "I'm saying that I think the president made sense in a lot of things he had to say, but we are a long way from achieving what I think would be a most effective strategy."" Reid J. Epstein in Politico.\par \par \uc2 Obama's proposed Syria strikes are 'largely divorced from the interests of the Syrian people.' "The ICG argues that the Obama administration's proposed strikes are "largely divorced from the interests of the Syrian people" and a real solution requires a much larger political component, including "reaching out to both Russia and Iran in a manner capable of eliciting their interest."" \uc2 Ezra Klein\uc2  in The Washington Post.\par \par \uc2 Here's what Syria itself is saying. "Syrian President Bashar al-Assad dismissed evidence the United States and France said shows his regime used chemical weapons on Syrian civilians, warning that any planned military response could result in a "regional war." In excerpts from an interview with French newspaper Le Figaro published Monday, Assad suggested it was illogical to think his army would have employed chemical weapons on Aug. 21 in Damascus, where its own soldiers were stationed. "Someone who makes accusations needs proof," Assad said, as translated by Al Jazeera. "We challenged the U.S. and France to show us proof. Mr. Obama and Hollande were incapable even when asked to do so by their own peoples."" Catherine Thompson in Talking Points Memo.\par \par \uc2 And Syrians are confused by U.S. delay. "Two days after President Obama shocked Syrians by delaying expected American missile strikes, the country remains off balance, with the military still bracing, the rebels still hoping to capitalize on the confusion, civilians increasingly fleeing across the borders and everyone uncertain whether the attack has been called off for good. Businesses were open and shops busy in government-held areas around the country on Monday, residents said, but not all government troops had moved out of the schools and other civilian areas they had moved into ahead of the attacks that were expected Saturday. Anxiety and anticipation from that day lingered." Anne Barnard in The \uc2 New York Times\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 @ianbremmer: Ready, Aim, F Not Ready #Syria\par \par \uc2 Russia may send delegation to U.S. to talk Syria. "The Russian news agency Interfax says President \uc2 Vladimir Putin\uc2  hopes to send a delegation of lawmakers to the U.S. to discuss the situation in Syria with members of Congress. Russian legislators Valentina Matvienko and Sergei Naryshkin proposed that to Putin on Monday, saying polls have shown little support among Americans for armed intervention in Syria to punish its regime for an alleged chemical weapons attack." The Associated Press.\par \par \uc2 And they rejected U.S. evidence for chemical-weapons use in Syria. "Russia's foreign minister dismissed as unconvincing the evidence presented by Secretary of State John Kerry of chemical weapons use by the Syrian government, saying on Monday that the United States had fallen far short of making a case for international cooperation on military strikes against the government of President Bashar al-Assad. "We were shown certain pieces of evidence that did not contain anything concrete, neither geographical locations, nor names, nor evidence that samples had been taken by professionals," Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov said in a speech at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations." David M. Herszenhorn in The \uc2 New York Times\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Israel supports U.S. action in Syria. "President \uc2 Shimon Peres\uc2  of Israel offered strong support on Monday for President Obama's decision to seek Congressional approval before taking military action in response to Syria's apparent use of chemical weapons, saying he had "full faith" in his "moral and operational stance."" Jodi Rudoren in The \uc2 New York Times\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 How a Syria war could matter for the economy. "In recent decades, potential U.S. military action in the Middle East has tended to spark heightened worries in markets\u8212\'20\'14boosting oil prices, in particular\u8212\'20\'14in advance of any operations. Those concerns often abated rapidly once action began, with the drop in oil costs and relief rally in stocks actually giving the economy a boost Fears of conflict in the Middle East often lead oil traders to push up prices in futures markets, and expectations of U.S.-led strikes on Syria are no exception. Oil prices rose to a two-year high over the past week\u8212\'20\'14trading above $110 a barrel in New York before retreating\u8212\'20\'14and contributed to sharp swings in equity markets. U.S. retail gasoline prices have followed oil higher. A gallon of regular unleaded averaged $3.59 across the U.S. on Saturday \uc2 J.P. Morgan Chase\uc2  economists, in their weekly note to clients Friday, said that, if sustained, the 10% increase in the price of oil over the past three months could shave as much as 0.3 percentage point off the annualized global growth rate in the second half of the year." Sudeep Reddy in The Wall Street Journal.\par \par \uc2 How do war powers work? "For the most part, presidents have sought congressional authorization when contemplating major military campaigns of potentially long duration. They rarely have requested Congress's permission before ordering shorter engagements That makes President Obama's position on Syria somewhat of an anomaly. Administration officials have indicated they envision a limited set of airstrikes to punish the Assad regime for using chemical weapons\u8212\'20\'14the type of attack presidents rarely have telegraphed in advance." Jess Bravin in The Wall Street Journal.\par \par \uc2 A big part of the Syria conversation: the limits on executive power. "The Syria debate in Congress is providing a new opportunity for a recent alliance of conservative and liberal lawmakers [i.e. libertarians] to cement their common interest in placing limits on executive authority. Already, House members from the political right and left have come together in an attempt to rein in the \uc2 National Security Agency\uc2 's surveillance of telephone-call data. They share other principles, such as a wariness, or in some cases opposition, to the use of drone strikes overseas, particularly to target U.S. citizens." Corey Boles in The Wall Street Journal.\par \par \uc2 @yeselson: If Dems and R's asked themselves how they would vote on Syria if the president was a Republican, they'd come to an honest position on merits\par \par \uc2 That includes a clash within the GOP between neocons and libertarians. "Syria, an issue on which Mr. McCain, a former Republican presidential candidate, and Mr. Paul, a possible contender in 2016, will almost certainly be the leading spokesmen for their party's two wings But even Republicans who are not active supporters of Mr. Paul recognize that the country and their party are susceptible to a come-home-America message at a moment of war weariness and, among conservatives, profound distrust toward Mr. Obama." Jonathan Martin in The \uc2 New York Times\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 POLK: A deep briefing on Syria. "My hunch is that Syria, like Afghanistan, would be torn apart not only into large chunks such as the Kurds in the northeast but even neighborhood by neighborhood as in the Iraqi cities If we are worried about a haven for terrorists or drug traffickers, Syria would be hard to beat. And if we are concerned about a sinkhole for American treasure, Syria would compete well with Iraq and Afghanistan. It would probably be difficult or even impossible to avoid "boots on the ground" there." William R. Polk in The Atlantic.\par \par \uc2 HAASS: America must pick a course of action on Syria. Now. "Foreign policy is often difficult, as the crisis in Syria all too regularly shows. But the Obama administration has made a difficult situation much worse by articulating a series of objectives ("Bashar al-Assad must go"; "Chemical weapons use crosses a red line") and policies ("we will arm the opposition") and then failing to follow them through. Requiring authority from Congress at the eleventh hour introduced further undesirable uncertainty. Improvisation and policy making on the fly can be disastrous The real interests at stake in Syria include stopping a humanitarian nightmare that has claimed more than 100,000 lives; frustrating the designs of Iran and its partners; reinforcing the norm that chemical weapons cannot be used with impunity; and demonstrating that what the US says is to be taken to the bank by friend and foe alike." \uc2 Richard N. Haass\uc2  in The Financial Times.\par \par \uc2 STAVRIDIS: Obama, call NATO. "The \uc2 North Atlantic Treaty Organization\uc2  must be part of an international effort to respond to the crisis in Syria, beginning immediately with punitive strikes following the highly probable use of chemical weapons by President \uc2 Bashar Al-Assad\uc2 's regime. The president, the secretaries of defense and state, and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff should all approach their counterparts to secure NATO action." \uc2 James G. Stavridis\uc2  in The \uc2 New York Times\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 SEIB: How Obama intends to get Congress's support. "The formula for legislative victory starts not with the opposition Republicans but with his own Democrats, runs through the still-powerful pro-Israel caucus and ends with a band of Republican hawks who have been far more eager for action in Syria than has the president now seeking their help Ultimately, the president's ability to achieve this feat may well depend on whether there is any life remaining in a time-honored idea, not recently tested: that politics ends at water's edge. The cost of failure would be high, nothing less than a blow to the proposition that a war-weary and economically strained U.S. is still capable of, or even interested in, leading the world." Gerald F. Seib in The Wall Street Journal.\par \par \uc2 DRUM: Syria and virtue. "Inspiring, isn't it? Why, it's almost as if the only thing anyone really cares about is their own narrow parochial interest. Enforcing a century-old ban against the use of chemical weapons may sound high-minded in the abstract, but down on the ground there's virtually no one who (a) actually cares about that and (b) would view a U.S. strike through that lens. You're for it because you're a Democrat or a Sunni or an Israeli or a member of the rebel army. You're against it if you're a Republican or a Shiite or an Egyptian or \uc2 Vladimir Putin\uc2 . Hardly anyone truly cares about American credibility or international norms or foreign policy doctrines or any of the other usual talking points. They've just chosen sides, that's all." Kevin Drum in Mother Jones.\par \par \uc2 CILLIZZA: Why Obama's decision to ask Congress about Syria is a high-stakes gamble. "There is little certainty of the outcome of the vote, which is expected to come the week of Sept. 9 when both houses of Congress return to Washington after the August recess First, consider that roughly 40 percent of House Democrats voted against the use of force resolution against Iraq in 2002."

"The Administration doesn't seem to have created contingency plans with its allies, prepared joint plans for military action it was ready to explain and defend, or to have laid the groundwork for releasing intelligence data. Instead, our British ally released one intelligence report talking about "at least 350 fatalities." Secretary Kerry was sandbagged into using an absurdly over-precise number like 1429 dead (of which an equally precise 426 were children); number which seem to have been taken from an unreliable Syrian source called the Local Coordination Committees and which did not agree with other Syrian opposition sources like the \uc2 Syrian Observatory for Human Rights\uc2 .""

For instance, the recent explosion in data analytics has sparked demand for data scientists in health care and retail What's perhaps most perplexing about the claim of a STEM worker shortage is that many studies have directly contradicted it, including reports from \uc2 Duke University\uc2 , the Rochester Institute of Technology, the \uc2 Alfred P. Sloan Foundation\uc2 , and the \uc2 Rand Corp\uc2 . A 2004 Rand study, for example, stated that there was no evidence "that such shortages have existed at least since 1990, nor that they are on the horizon." That report argued that the best indicator of a shortfall would be a widespread rise in salaries throughout the STEM community. But the price of labor has not risen, as you would expect it to do if STEM workers were scarce." Robert N. Charette in IEEE Spectrum.\par \par \uc2 DELONG: Whose central bank? "One camp, call it the Banking Camp, regards a central bank as a bank for bankers. Its clients are the banks; it is a place where banks can go to borrow money when they really need to; and its functions are to support the banking sector The other camp, call it the Macroeconomic Camp, views central banks as stewards of the economy as a whole. A central bank's job is to uphold in practice Say's Law In terms of the US public interest and that of the world it is very important that whoever President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  nominates to succeed Federal Reserve Chairman \uc2 Ben Bernanke\uc2  when his term expires at the beginning of 2014 is from the Macroeconomic Camp. The world does not need a bankers' central banker any more today than it did five years ago." J. Bradford DeLong in Project Syndicate.\par \par \uc2 ROGOFF: Are emerging markets submerging? "The market has been particularly brutal to countries that need to finance significant ongoing current-account deficits, such as Brazil, India, South Africa, and Indonesia. Fortunately, a combination of flexible exchange rates, strong international reserves, better monetary regimes, and a shift away from foreign-currency debt provides some measure of protection A narrowing of growth differentials has made emerging markets a bit less of a no-brainer for investors, and this is naturally producing sizable effects on these countries' asset prices." \uc2 Kenneth Rogoff\uc2  in Project Syndicate.\par \par \uc2 KRUGMAN: Love for labor lost. "It wasn't always about the hot dogs. Originally, believe it or not, Labor Day actually had something to do with showing respect for labor [W]hat's unimaginable now is that Congress would unanimously offer even an empty gesture of support for workers' dignity. For the fact is that many of today's politicians can't even bring themselves to fake respect for ordinary working Americans." \uc2 Paul Krugman\uc2  in The \uc2 New York Times\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 DIONNE: A comeback for labor? "The genius of the labor movement has always been its insistence that if the law genuinely empowered workers to defend their own interests, the result would be a more just society requiring fewer direct interventions by government. This Labor Day could be remembered as the moment when that idea rose again." E.J. Dionne in The Washington Post.\par \par \uc2 FOLBRE: Not really Labor's Day. "In the classical terminology of Marx, a large reserve army of labor reduces both the individual and the collective bargaining power of workers, enabling capital to take a bigger piece of the economic pie.

Millions more have abandoned their job searches, hiding from the economic storm in school or turning to government programs for support. A growing body of economic research suggests that the longer they remain on the sidelines, the less likely they will be to work again; for many, it may already be too late [M]ore worrisome to economists are signs of a bifurcation in the labor market: For those unemployed less than six months, the odds of finding a job have improved steadily over the past year; the long-term unemployed have made almost no progress at all."

Pakistan appears at the top of charts listing critical U.S. intelligence gaps. It is named as a target of newly formed analytic cells. And fears about the security of its nuclear program are so pervasive that a budget section on containing the spread of illicit weapons divides the world into two categories: Pakistan and everybody else." \uc2 Greg Miller\uc2 , Craig Whitlock and Barton Gellman in The Washington Post.\par \par \uc2 U.S. intelligence agencies spend millions to hunt for insider threats, document shows.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 President \uc2 Obama\uc2  delivered the following remarks at the "Let Freedom Ring" ceremony to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington on Aug. 28, 2013, at the Lincoln Memorial.\par \par \uc2 PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA:To the King family, who have sacrificed and inspired so much, to President Clinton, President Carter, Vice President Biden, Jill, fellow Americans, five decades ago today, Americans came to this honored place to lay claim to a promise made at our founding.\par \par \uc2 We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\par \par \uc2 In 1963, almost 200 years after those words were set to paper, a full century after a great war was fought and emancipation proclaimed, that promise, those truths remained unmet. And so they came by the thousands, from every corner of our country -- men and women, young and old, blacks who longed for freedom and whites who could no longer accept freedom for themselves while witnessing the subjugation of others. Across the land, congregations sent them off with food and with prayer. In the middle of the night, entire blocks of Harlem came out to wish them well.\par \par \uc2 With the few dollars they scrimped from their labor, some bought tickets and boarded buses, even if they couldn't always sit where they wanted to sit. Those with less money hitchhiked, or walked. They were seamstresses, and steelworkers, and students, and teachers, maids and pullman porters. They shared simple meals and bunked together on floors.\par \par \uc2 And then, on a hot summer day, they assembled here, in our nation's capital, under the shadow of the great emancipator, to offer testimony of injustice, to petition their government for redress and to awaken America's long-slumbering conscience.\par \par \uc2 We rightly and best remember Dr. King's soaring oratory that day, how he gave mighty voice to the quiet hopes of millions, how he offered a salvation path for oppressed and oppressors alike. His words belong to the ages, possessing a power and prophecy unmatched in our time.\par \par \uc2 But we would do well to recall that day itself also belonged to those ordinary people whose names never appeared in the history books, never got on TV.\par \par \uc2 Many had gone to segregated schools and sat at segregated lunch counters, had lived in towns where they couldn't vote, in cities where their votes didn't matter. There were couples in love who couldn't marry, soldiers who fought for freedom abroad that they found denied to them at home. They had seen loved ones beaten and children fire- hosed. And they had every reason to lash out in anger or resign themselves to a bitter fate.\par \par \uc2 And yet they chose a different path. In the face of hatred, they prayed for their tormentors. In the face of violence, they stood up and sat in with the moral force of nonviolence. Willingly, they went to jail to protest unjust laws, their cells swelling with the sound of freedom songs. A lifetime of indignities had taught them that no man can take away the dignity and grace that God grants us. They had learned through hard experience what Frederick Douglas once taught: that freedom is not given; it must be won through struggle and discipline, persistence and faith.\par \par \uc2 That was the spirit they brought here that day.\par \par \uc2 That was the spirit young people like John Lewis brought that day. That was the spirit that they carried with them like a torch back to their cities and their neighborhoods, that steady flame of conscience and courage that would sustain them through the campaigns to come, through boycotts and voter registration drives and smaller marches, far from the spotlight, through the loss of four little girls in Birmingham, the carnage of Edmund Pettus Bridge and the agony of Dallas, California, Memphis. Through setbacks and heartbreaks and gnawing doubt, that flame of justice flickered and never died.\par \par \uc2 And because they kept marching, America changed. Because they marched, the civil rights law was passed. Because they marched, the voting rights law was signed. Because they marched, doors of opportunity and education swung open so their daughters and sons could finally imagine a life for themselves beyond washing somebody else's laundry or shining somebody else's shoes. (Applause.) Because they marched, city councils changed and state legislatures changed and Congress changed and, yes, eventually the White House changed. (Cheers, applause.)\par \par \uc2 Because they marched, America became more free and more fair, not just for African-Americans but for women and Latinos, Asians and Native Americans, for Catholics, Jews and Muslims, for gays, for Americans with disabilities.\par \par \uc2 America changed for you and for me.\par \par \uc2 And the entire world drew strength from that example, whether it be young people who watched from the other side of an Iron Curtain and would eventually tear down that wall, or the young people inside South Africa who would eventually end the scourge of apartheid. (Applause.) Those are the victories they won, with iron wills and hope in their hearts. That is the transformation that they wrought with each step of their well-worn shoes. That's the depth that I and millions of Americans owe those maids, those laborers, those porters, those secretaries -- folks who could have run a company, maybe, if they had ever had a chance; those white students who put themselves in harm's way even though they didn't have to -- (applause) -- those Japanese- Americans who recalled their own interment, those Jewish Americans who had survived the Holocaust, people who could have given up and given in but kept on keeping on, knowing that weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning -- (cheers, applause) -- on the battlefield of justice, men and women without rank or wealth or title or fame would liberate us all, in ways that our children now take for granted as people of all colors and creeds live together and learn together and walk together, and fight alongside one another and love one another, and judge one another by the content of our character in this greatest nation on Earth.\par \par \uc2 To dismiss the magnitude of this progress, to suggest, as some sometimes do, that little has changed -- that dishonors the courage and the sacrifice of those who paid the price to march in those years. (Applause.) Medgar Evers, James Chaney, Andrew Goodman, Michael Schwerner, Martin Luther King Jr., they did not die in vain. (Applause.) Their victory was great.\par \par \uc2 But we would dishonor those heroes as well to suggest that the work of this nation is somehow complete. The arc of the moral universe may bend towards justice, but it doesn't bend on its own. To secure the gains this country has made requires constant vigilance, not complacency. Whether it's by challenging those who erect new barriers to the vote or ensuring that the scales of justice work equally for all in the criminal justice system and not simply a pipeline from underfunded schools to overcrowded jails -- (applause) -- it requires vigilance.\par \par \uc2 (Cheers, applause.)\par \par \uc2 And we'll suffer the occasional setback. But we will win these fights. This country has changed too much. (Applause.) People of good will, regardless of party, are too plentiful for those with ill will to change history's currents. (Applause.)\par \par \uc2 In some ways, though, the securing of civil rights, voting rights, the eradication of legalized discrimination -- the very significance of these victories may have obscured a second goal of the march, for the men and women who gathered 50 years ago were not there in search of some abstract idea. They were there seeking jobs as well as justice -- (applause) -- not just the absence of oppression but the presence of economic opportunity. For what does it profit a man, Dr. King would ask, to sit at an integrated lunch counter if he can't afford the meal?\par \par \uc2 This idea that -- that one's liberty is linked to one's livelihood, that the pursuit of happiness requires the dignity of work, the skills to find work, decent pay, some measure of material security -- this idea was not new.\par \par \uc2 Lincoln himself understood the Declaration of Independence in such terms, as a promise that in due time, the weights should be lifted from the shoulders of all men and that all should have an equal chance.\par \par \uc2 Dr. King explained that the goals of African-Americans were identical to working people of all races: decent wages, fair working conditions, livable housing, old age security, health and welfare measures -- conditions in which families can grow, have education for their children and respect in the community.\par \par \uc2 What King was describing has been the dream of every American. It's what's lured for centuries new arrivals to our shores. And it's along this second dimension of economic opportunity, the chance through honest toil to advance one's station in life, that the goals of 50 years ago have fallen most short.\par \par \uc2 Yes, there have been examples of success within black America that would have been unimaginable a half-century ago. But as has already been noted, black unemployment has remained almost twice as high as white employment (sic), Latino unemployment close behind. The gap in wealth between races has not lessened, it's grown.\par \par \uc2 As President Clinton indicated, the position of all working Americans, regardless of color, has eroded, making the dream Dr. King described even more elusive.\par \par \uc2 For over a decade, working Americans of all races have seen their wages and incomes stagnate. Even as corporate profits soar, even as the pay of a fortunate few explodes, inequality has steadily risen over the decades. Upward mobility has become harder. In too many communities across this country in cities and suburbs and rural hamlets, the shadow of poverty casts a pall over our youth, their lives a fortress of substandard schools and diminished prospects, inadequate health care and perennial violence.\par \par \uc2 And so as we mark this anniversary, we must remind ourselves that the measure of progress for those who marched 50 years ago was not merely how many blacks had joined the ranks of millionaires; it was whether this country would admit all people who were willing to work hard, regardless of race, into the ranks of a middle-class life. (Applause.) The test was not and never has been whether the doors of opportunity are cracked a bit wider for a few. It was whether our economic system provides a fair shot for the many, for the black custodian and the white steelworker, the immigrant dishwasher and the Native American veteran. To win that battle, to answer that call -- this remains our great unfinished business.\par \par \uc2 We shouldn't fool ourselves. The task will not be easy. Since 1963 the economy's changed.\par \par \uc2 The twin forces of technology and global competition have subtracted those jobs that once provided a foothold into the middle class, reduced the bargaining power of American workers.\par \par \uc2 And our politics has suffered. Entrenched interests -- those who benefit from an unjust status quo resisted any government efforts to give working families a fair deal, marshaling an army of lobbyists and opinion makers to argue that minimum wage increases or stronger labor laws or taxes on the wealthy who could afford it just to fund crumbling schools -- that all these things violated sound economic principles.\par \par \uc2 We'd be told that growing inequality was the price for a growing economy, a measure of the free market -- that greed was good and compassion ineffective, and those without jobs or health care had only themselves to blame.\par \par \uc2 And then there were those elected officials who found it useful to practice the old politics of division, doing their best to convince middle-class Americans of a great untruth, that government was somehow itself to blame for their growing economic insecurity -- that distant bureaucrats were taking their hard-earned dollars to benefit the welfare cheat or the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 And then, if we're honest with ourselves, we'll admit that during the course of 50 years, there were times when some of us, claiming to push for change, lost our way. The anguish of assassinations set off self-defeating riots.\par \par \uc2 Legitimate grievances against police brutality tipped into excuse- making for criminal behavior. Racial politics could cut both ways as the transformative message of unity and brotherhood was drowned out by the language of recrimination. And what had once been a call for equality of opportunity, the chance for all Americans to work hard and get ahead was too often framed as a mere desire for government support, as if we had no agency in our own liberation, as if poverty was an excuse for not raising your child and the bigotry of others was reason to give up on yourself. All of that history is how progress stalled. That's how hope was diverted. It's how our country remained divided.\par \par \uc2 But the good news is, just as was true in 1963, we now have a choice. We can continue down our current path in which the gears of this great democracy grind to a halt and our children accept a life of lower expectations, where politics is a zero-sum game, where a few do very well while struggling families of every race fight over a shrinking economic pie. That's one path. Or we can have the courage to change.\par \par \uc2 The March on Washington teaches us that we are not trapped by the mistakes of history, that we are masters of our fate.\par \par \uc2 But it also teaches us that the promise of this nation will only be kept when we work together. We'll have to reignite the embers of empathy and fellow feeling, the coalition of conscience that found expression in this place 50 years ago.\par \par \uc2 And I believe that spirit is there, that true force inside each of us. I see it when a white mother recognizes her own daughter in the face of a poor black child. I see it when the black youth thinks of his own grandfather in the dignified steps of an elderly white man. It's there when the native born recognizing that striving spirit of a new immigrant, when the interracial couple connects the pain of a gay couple who were discriminated against and understands it as their own. That's where courage comes from, when we turn not from each other or on each other but towards one another, and we find that we do not walk alone. That's where courage comes from. (Applause.)\par \par \uc2 And with that courage, we can stand together for good jobs and just wages. With that courage, we can stand together for the right to health care in the richest nation on earth for every person. (Applause.) With that courage, we can stand together for the right of every child, from the corners of Anacostia to the hills of Appalachia, to get an education that stirs the mind and captures the spirit and prepares them for the world that awaits them. (Applause.) With that courage, we can feed the hungry and house the homeless and transform bleak wastelands of poverty into fields of commerce and promise.\par \par \uc2 America, I know the road will be long, but I know we can get there. Yes, we will stumble, but I know we'll get back up. That's how a movement happens. That's how history bends. That's how, when somebody is faint of heart, somebody else brings them along and says, come on, we're marching. (Cheers, applause.)\par \par \uc2 There's a reason why so many who marched that day and in the days to come were young, for the young are unconstrained by habits of fear, unconstrained by the conventions of what is. They dared to dream different and to imagine something better. And I am convinced that same imagination, the same hunger of purpose serves in this generation.\par \par \uc2 We might not face the same dangers as 1963, but the fierce urgency of now remains. We may never duplicate the swelling crowds and dazzling processions of that day so long ago, no one can match King's brilliance, but the same flames that lit the heart of all who are willing to take a first step for justice, I know that flame remains. (Applause.)\par \par \uc2 That tireless teacher who gets to class early and stays late and dips into her own pocket to buy supplies because she believes that every child is her charge -- she's marching. (Applause.) That successful businessman who doesn't have to, but pays his workers a fair wage and then offers a shot to a man, maybe an ex-con, who's down on his luck -- he's marching.\par \par \uc2 (Cheers, applause.) The mother who pours her love into her daughter so that she grows up with the confidence to walk through the same doors as anybody's son -- she's marching. (Cheers, applause.) The father who realizes the most important job he'll ever have is raising his boy right, even if he didn't have a father, especially if he didn't have a father at home -- he's marching. (Applause.) The battle-scarred veterans who devote themselves not only to helping their fellow warriors stand again and walk again and run again, but to keep serving their country when they come home -- they are marching. (Applause.) Everyone who realizes what those glorious patriots knew on that day, that change does not come from Washington but to Washington, that change has always been built on our willingness, we, the people, to take on the mantle of citizenship -- you are marching. (Applause.)\par \par \uc2 And that's the lesson of our past, that's the promise of tomorrow, that in the face of impossible odds, people who love their country can change it. And when millions of Americans of every race and every region, every faith and every station can join together in a spirit of brotherhood, then those mountains will be made low, and those rough places will be made plain, and those crooked places, they straighten out towards grace, and we will vindicate the faith of those who sacrificed so much and live up to the true meaning of our creed as one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. (Cheers, applause.)\par \par \uc2 More to come.\par \par \uc2 Transcript courtesy of Federal News Service.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020130828e98s00568\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 California Republican Rep. \uc2 Gary Miller\uc2  has earned a reputation as an immigration hardliner, but when confronted by a group of young immigrants Friday at a public event in Rancho Cucamonga (which had a $12 entry fee), Miller told them he understands their plight because he, too, is an immigrant, of sorts, moving with his family from Arkansas to California as a young child.\par \par \uc2 DREAMers, the children of undocumented immigrants, face deportation and other legal persecution (a threat delayed, at least for now, by President Obama's 2012 deferred action policy), but Miller explained that he personally understands the difficulty they face because he moved across the country.\par \par \uc2 "You know, I've talked to a lot of young people like [you]," Miller told the young activists, captured in footage taken by a Democratic tracker. "I mean, I understand the difficulty. Just like I was born in Arkansas. I came here when I was a year old."\par \par \uc2 The pro-Democratic House Majority PAC provided the video, which you can watch here (key exchange begins around 1:23):\par \par \uc2 But, of course, there's a big difference between moving across state lines and across international borders. "It's stunning in its ignorance and revealing in how out of touch some Republicans are with the experience of undocumented immigrants," said \uc2 Frank Sharry\uc2 , the executive director of America's Voice, a pro-immigration reform group. "And this is a guy who represents a district in California, the state that has the largest number of undocumented immigrants in the country."\par \par \uc2 "So for him to say, I get your experience, I came from Arkansas to California, as if that is equivalent to a young kid coming from Mexico or El Salvador and growing up in the American school system and having opportunities denied to you because of your family's immigration status, I mean, oh my God," Sharry continued. "I'm going from finding it really hilarious to really disturbing."\par \par \uc2 Miller's San Bernardino County district is nearly half Latino, and immigration reform is popular, but he spent years cultivating a hardline anti-\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  position when he represented another, more conservative district that covered parts of Orange and Los Angeles counties. And old version of his campaign Web site stated that there were "12 to 20 million law breakers who flaunt our immigration laws" living in the country. His solution was simple: "Send Them Home."\par \par \uc2 But as he heads into the 2014 election defending a seat that Obama won by 17 points, he seems to be changing his tune. He told Univision he no longer believes that it's possible to deport all undocumented immigrants, and \uc2 BuzzFeed\uc2 's Andrew Kaczynski caught Miller quietly scrubbing old \uc2 YouTube\uc2  videos and statements from his Web sites that advocated a tougher stance on immigration. The scrubbed material blamed immigrants to taking American jobs and referenced "anchor babies," "illegals" and "amnesty."\par \par \uc2 Miller's spokesperson could not immediately provide a statement, but we'll update with one as soon we get it.\par \par \uc2 UPDATE: Miller spokeswoman Megan Bush sent the following statement:\par \par \uc2 Congressman Miller recognizes that when it comes to our nation's immigration laws, the status quo is unacceptable. He believes we need an immigration system that is effective, fair, enhances public safety, and supports economic growth.\par \par \uc2 While the vast majority of individuals seeking entry into the United States are hard-working men and women who want to make a better life for their families, there are some who would come here to engage in drug trafficking, human smuggling, and other violent crimes that put our communities at risk. As such, Congressman Miller believes that any reform proposal must make securing our ports and northern and southern borders a top priority. In addition, he believes that we need a mandatory, effective and workable employment verification system to increase job opportunities for Americans and prevent the exploitation of undocumented workers.\par \par \uc2 Congressman Miller is proud to represent the hard-working men and women of the 31st District and takes his responsibility to represent the views of his constituents very seriously. Since January, he has met with over thirty groups and hundreds of individuals to discuss this complex issue. As the immigration debate moves to the House, he will continue to listen to the concerns of residents, business leaders, and local law enforcement and will carefully review any proposed legislation before he casts his vote to ensure that it meets the needs of the 31st District.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020130827e98r003pj\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 right-turn\par {\*\bkmkstart toc94}{\*\bkmkend toc94}\b \uc2 The myth of 'showing up'\b0\par\par\uc2 By Jennifer Rubin   \par \uc2 514 \uc2 words\par \uc2 23 August 2013\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2013, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Conservatives who oppose any policy revision, especially immigration reform, that they deem to be "selling out" will tell you that the way to win minority voters is to "show up." That is condescending and wrong.\par \par \uc2 Minority voters, like all voters, care about what you say. They aren't merely flattered to be visited; they want something. Hard-right conservatives have gotten the idea that it is not conservative to "give" voters things. But of course, all government is designed to "give" voters something, even if the ends are conservative (e.g. tax cuts, school vouchers). We see no evidence that stark appeals to entrepreneurship or purely ideological conservative nostrums move minority voters.\par \par \uc2 Take, for example, the semi-disastrous appearance by Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) at \uc2 Howard University\uc2 , where he was greeted with stony silence. The African American students didn't like being lectured about the political history of African Americans, and they didn't seem to warm to a strident libertarian theme.\par \par \uc2 And it doesn't make any difference if that strident rhetoric is delivered by a minority candidate. If this really did work, then Alan Keyes would have been elected to something or former congressman Allen West (R-Fla.) would have held his seat.\par \par \uc2 Take instead GOP governors like Susana Martinez (New Mexico), Brian Sandoval (Nevada), \uc2 Chris Christie\uc2  (New Jersey) and others who show up with something that might actually attract minority voters -- better schools, more jobs and the like. When Christie was in Camden on Wednesday, African American elected officials, religious leaders and parents weren't cheering the governor for showing up; they were cheering his move to take over the failing schools, put in good people and a decent curriculum and insist those schools work.\par \par \uc2 And here is where the most ideological pols on the right fail. These are people who regard transactional politics as debased and think the highest calling of a politician is to reject deal-making. Even if the ideologues show up in minority areas, they don't have anything minority voters want to hear. A lecture on "free-market economics" or a tutorial on the "rule of law"? Puleez. These voters already think Republicans are out to lunch and don't understand them.\par \par \uc2 And I wonder what minority voters in a Democratic enclave would say if a pol argued that no \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  should have a way of attaining citizenship and the best thing to do is to shut down the government so they can get rid of Obamacare with no replacement in mind. Oh, they wouldn't talk about that stuff? Well, the conversation then would be short and dishonest. And "showing up" wouldn't make up for a message that these voters find offensive or harmful.\par \par \uc2 Talk about things that will improve their lives and they may perk up; deliver on those promises and they'll applaud.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 FOR THE crime of appearing Hispanic, Roxana Santos, a native of El Salvador, attracted the attention of Frederick County sheriff's deputies in 2008. At the time she was noticed and racially profiled by the deputies, Ms. Santos was doing nothing more than sitting on a curb and eating a sandwich outside the food co-op in Frederick where she worked as a dishwasher.\par \par \uc2 In Frederick, where Sheriff \uc2 Charles Jenkins\uc2  has publicly pledged to make life unfriendly for undocumented immigrants, it's open season for law enforcement on anyone who looks the part \u8212\'20\'14 meaning anyone who looks Hispanic.\par \par \uc2 The deputies, Kevin Lynch and Jeffrey Openshaw, acted on no suspicion of criminal conduct. Indeed, Ms. Santos, who is undocumented, has no criminal history. Nonetheless, they approached her, asked for her identification and, after a considerable wait, told her to sit tight while a federal data base digested her name. No, she would not be on time for her shift.\par \par \uc2 On Wednesday, a federal appeals court slapped down Mr. Jenkins and the county sheriff's department. The appeals court said that law enforcement officers may not go around accosting people merely on the suspicion that they may lack immigration documents, no matter what they look like or how limited their facility with English. As the court pointed out, an individual's unauthorized presence in the United States is not a crime; it's a civil violation of immigration law.\par \par \uc2 The ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit, in Richmond, is consistent with last year's \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2  ruling on Arizona's anti-immigrant statute. In that case, the \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2  allowed police to determine the immigration status of people they stop or arrest for other reasons. But Justice \uc2 Anthony Kennedy\uc2 , writing for the court's majority, noted it is not a crime for an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  to be present in the country. "Detaining individuals solely to verify their immigration status would raise constitutional concerns," he wrote.\par \par \uc2 In the case of Ms. Santos, the appeals court pointed out that police who start asking questions based solely on the race or ethnicity of their interlocutor may also run afoul of the Fourth Amendment's equal protection clause.\par \par \uc2 All this may come as news to Mr. Jenkins, whose tough-guy political persona is wrapped up in harassing illegal immigrants, whom he blames for all sorts of problems, including Maryland's budgetary travails.\par \par \uc2 About 8 percent of Frederick County's 240,000 people are Hispanic, and minorities generally have contributed heavily to the county's rapid growth. That may be jarring to some county residents; it surely has presented political opportunities to officials such as Mr. Jenkins, who have gotten mileage from bashing illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Nonetheless, it is the sheriff's job to uphold the law. And in the absence of probable cause to suspect criminal activity, the Fourth Amendment prohibition of unreasonable searches and seizures forbids police from harassing people based solely on their presumed immigration status.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Santos, a mother of three, remains in the country while her court case continues, although she may still face deportation. In the meantime, the appeals court has determined that her constitutional rights were violated. Let's hope Mr. Jenkins gets the message.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020130810e98a0043c\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 A federal appeals court, in a strong rebuff to local law enforcement agencies that aggressively pursue people they suspect of being illegal immigrants, ruled Wednesday that the Frederick County Sheriff's Office did not have the right to arrest Roxana Santos, a Salvadoran dishwasher who was seized while eating a sandwich outside her workplace in the fall of 2008 and jailed for the next 45 days.\par \par \uc2 The ruling, from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit, based in Richmond, appeared to clarify and strengthen a somewhat ambiguous Supreme Court decision last year in Arizona v. United States, in which the high court expressed reservations but did not explicitly state how far local police may go when they seek to identify, arrest and aid in deporting individuals who might be in the country illegally but are not involved in criminal activity.\par \par \uc2 The high-profile issue of whether police can enforce federal immigration law also was raised last year in Alabama and several other states where officers had been accused of harassing illegal immigrants at traffic stops and in other situations, either to force them to leave the area or to have them deported.\par \par \uc2 "We hold that, absent express direction or authorization by federal officials, state and local law enforcement officers may not detain or arrest an individual solely based on known or suspected civil violations of federal immigration law," the court concluded after a long and detailed analysis of the encounter between Santos and the officers.\par \par \uc2 Officials from pro-immigrant groups in Maryland, who helped Santos pursue a legal complaint in the incident, described the ruling as a reinforcement of their longtime allegations that Frederick authorities, under the leadership of Sheriff \uc2 Chuck Jenkins\uc2 , had attempted to drive out illegal immigrants in ways that broke the law.\par \par \uc2 "Sheriff Jenkins really declared war on the most rapidly growing population in Frederick County," said \uc2 Kim Propeack\uc2 , a spokeswoman for Casa of Maryland, an immigrant advocacy group. "This ruling definitely vindicates Roxana and the many hundreds of people there who have been pulled over on a pretext, even a broken taillight, in order to push them into deportation."\par \par \uc2 Jenkins's office said Wednesday evening that he would have no comment on the ruling. An outspoken opponent of illegal immigration, Jenkins has been a longtime lightning rod in the divisive issue. His department was the only law enforcement agency in Maryland to sign on to a program of formal cooperation with federal immigration authorities in which local officers detained and turned over suspected illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Santos filed a lawsuit against Frederick County through pro-immigrant groups and sympathetic law firms, claiming that her constitutional rights had been violated when she was arrested. The lawsuit was dismissed by the U.S. District Court in Maryland last year, but the Wednesday ruling overturned that order.\par \par \uc2 In detailed and precise language, the court re-created the entire encounter between Santos and two deputy sheriffs. It found that they had illegally "seized" Santos when she tried to get up from her bench and walk away and that they did not have the right to arrest her merely because they had ascertained, after questioning her while she sat eating a sandwich in a public park, that she was facing a federal deportation order as an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Santos, a mother of three who speaks little English, was released from federal custody while the court case was continuing, but she still could face deportation. The court found, however, that even though she is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , her constitutional rights to protection from "unreasonable search and seizure" were violated.\par \par \uc2 The defendants had argued that the officers had not harmed or threatened her and that they had arrested her only after learning there was a deportation order pending against her.\par \par \uc2 pamela.constable@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020130808e988000dx\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Vivek Wadhwa is Vice President of Innovation and Research at Singularity University and Arthur & Toni Rembe Rock Center for Corporate Governance at \uc2 Stanford University\uc2 . His other academic appointments include Duke and Emory Universities as well as past appointments at Harvard and the University of California Berkeley. This piece reflects his opinion.\par \par \uc2 I used to believe that clearing up the skilled-immigrant backlog and creating a startup visa should be Congress's top legislative priorities. This is what I focused on in my book, "Immigrant Exodus". If you had told me a documentary could shift my mindset, I would have said you were crazy. That was before I watched "Documented" a film that made me realize there is a piece of legislation even more desperately in need of passage: the DREAM Act.\par \par \uc2 There are an estimated 1.8 million children in the U.S. who could be classified as "illegal aliens", according to the Immigration Policy Center. They didn't knowingly break any laws. Their parents brought them to this country to give them a better future. These "DREAMers" as they are called, grew up as Americans, believing they were entitled to the same rights and freedoms as their friends. But, because they don't have the proper paperwork, they are forced to live in the shadows of society\u8212\'20\'14as second-class human beings with limits on where they can work and study, and what they can do. Until recently, they would also fear being rounded up in the middle of the night to be deported to a land that they don't even remember.\par \par \uc2 This is unconscionable in a country that prides itself on being a champion of human rights.\par \par \uc2 This reality was brought to life for me in the film by Jose Antonio Vargas, a Filipino immigrant brought to this country when he was twelve years old. Vargas studied at San Francisco State University and became a journalist. He shared a Pulitzer Prize for a story he wrote while working at The Washington Post in 2007, and he made headlines two years ago by revealing in a \uc2 New York Times Magazine\uc2  article that he is an undocumented immigrant.\par \par \uc2 In "Documented," Vargas tells of how he didn't know that he was illegal until he was 16, when he went to apply for a driver's license. He lived, from that point on, in constant fear of being deported. At every turn, through his days at school and his rise through the ranks of journalism, he would have to lie about his status. Most troublesome was the way he was cut off from his mother, who sent him away to live with his grandparents in America. He couldn't travel back to the Philippines and she couldn't get a visa to travel to America. So, for over 20 years, they drifted apart. Vargas became conflicted and confused. The most touching scene in the film was when his mother cried in her kitchen in Manila lamenting that her son wouldn't even accept her as a friend on \uc2 Facebook\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 It isn't that I haven't read about the plight of the undocumented or don't know any DREAMers. I know several people who have overstayed their visas or who were brought illegally to the United States as children. I have always been sympathetic to their cause. But Vargas's story changed me, giving me clearer window on the life of an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . His story and the manner in which it is told makes you better understand their emotions and hardships.\par \par \uc2 I hope all of our political leaders watch this film. They need to understand that skilled immigration is an economic issue that is directly tied to the health of our economy. But this is about more than the economy: providing basic human rights to the millions of undocumented children who live in the shadows of U.S. society is something we must do to heal the soul of this nation.\par \par \uc2 Comprehensive immigration reform is caught in the quagmire of partisan politics. At best, the odds are 50-50 that any legislation will pass. It is bad enough that we are gambling with the economic future of this country. Let's not gamble with the lives of its DREAMers. Congress should approve the DREAM Act as a down payment. This can't wait.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020130807e9870043b\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved   \par \par \uc2 A federal appeals court, in a strong rebuff to local law enforcement agencies that aggressively pursue people they suspect of being illegal immigrants, ruled Wednesday that the Frederick County Sheriff's Office did not have the right to arrest Roxana Santos, a Salvadoran dishwasher who was seized while eating a sandwich outside her workplace in the fall of 2008 and jailed for the next 45 days.\par \par \uc2 The ruling, from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit, based in Richmond, appeared to clarify and strengthen a somewhat ambiguous Supreme Court decision last year in Arizona v. United States, in which the high court expressed reservations but did not explicitly state how far local police may go when they seek to identify, arrest and aid in deporting individuals who might be in the country illegally but are not involved in criminal activity.\par \par \uc2 The high-profile issue of whether police can enforce federal immigration law also was raised last year in Alabama and several other states where officers had been accused of harassing illegal immigrants at traffic stops and in other situations, either to force them to leave the area or to have them deported.\par \par \uc2 "We hold that, absent express direction or authorization by federal officials, state and local law enforcement officers may not detain or arrest an individual solely based on known or suspected civil violations of federal immigration law," the court concluded after a long and detailed analysis of the encounter between Santos and the officers.\par \par \uc2 Officials from pro-immigrant groups in Maryland, who helped Santos pursue a legal complaint in the incident, described the ruling as a reinforcement of their longtime allegations that Frederick authorities, under the leadership of Sheriff \uc2 Chuck Jenkins\uc2 , had attempted to drive out illegal immigrants in ways that broke the law.\par \par \uc2 "Sheriff Jenkins really declared war on the most rapidly growing population in Frederick County," said \uc2 Kim Propeack\uc2 , a spokeswoman for Casa of Maryland, an immigrant advocacy group. "This ruling definitely vindicates Roxana and the many hundreds of people there who have been pulled over on a pretext, even a broken taillight, in order to push them into deportation."\par \par \uc2 Jenkins's office said Wednesday evening that he would have no comment on the ruling. An outspoken opponent of illegal immigration, Jenkins has been a longtime lightning rod in the divisive issue. His department was the only law enforcement agency in Maryland to sign on to a program of formal cooperation with federal immigration authorities in which local officers detained and turned over suspected illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Santos filed a lawsuit against Frederick County through pro-immigrant groups and sympathetic law firms, claiming that her constitutional rights had been violated when she was arrested. The lawsuit was dismissed by the U.S. District Court in Maryland last year, but the Wednesday ruling overturned that order.\par \par \uc2 In detailed and precise language, the court re-created the entire encounter between Santos and two deputy sheriffs. It found that they had illegally "seized" Santos when she tried to get up from her bench and walk away and that they did not have the right to arrest her merely because they had ascertained, after questioning her while she sat eating a sandwich in a public park, that she was facing a federal deportation order as an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Santos, a mother of three who speaks little English, was released from federal custody while the court case was continuing, but she still could face deportation. The court found, however, that even though she is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , her constitutional rights to protection from "unreasonable search and seizure" were violated.\par \par \uc2 The defendants had argued that the officers had not harmed or threatened her and that they had arrested her only after learning there was a deportation order pending against her.\par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com\par \par \uc2 WP20130808santos8\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020130808e98800009\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

Steve King\u8217\'20\'19s controversial claim about undocumented youth, and find it wanting.\b0\par\par\uc2 By Glenn Kessler   \par \uc2 1,434 \uc2 words\par \uc2 29 July 2013\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2013, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 "For everyone who's a valedictorian, there's another hundred out there who weigh a hundred and thirty pounds\u8212\'20\'14and they've got calves the size of cantaloupes because they're hauling seventy-five pounds of marijuana across the desert. Those people would be legalized with the same act."\par \par \uc2 --Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa), interview with NewsMax, July 18, 2013\par \par \uc2 "You know, you only get one valedictorian per class per year. And they aren't all dreamers. And a lot of other American kids out here that are competing for that valedictorian status. But every night there are dozens and scores of people that are smuggling drugs across our border. \u8230\'20\'26 This isn't something that just was made up out of thin air. This is something I get from the people enforcing the law down on the border."\par \par \uc2 --King, interview on CNN, July 24\par \par \uc2 "I got a call from them [border control agents] yesterday, and I said, 'Did I need to come back down and refresh myself?' They said, 'No, you're spot on with what you're saying but maybe you got the weight ten pounds up.'"\par \par \uc2 --King, interview on Fox News, July 27\par \par \uc2 Despite being lambasted by top Republican officials for his initial "cantaloupe" remarks in a Newsmax interview, Rep. Steve King has stood his ground. He insists that for every child of an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who is a valedictorian, there are another hundred who are drug smugglers\u8212\'20\'14a claim that he says was not "made up out of thin air." In fact, he added, it "was probably understated."\par \par \uc2 King's claim is aimed at undercutting support for providing a pathway to citizenship for so-called "DREAMers," people who came to the United States illegally as children. Under the proposed DREAM Act, people between the ages of 12 and 35 who came to the United States aged 15 and younger and meet a list of qualifications, as such obtaining a high school degree and having "good moral character," can eventually become citizens.\par \par \uc2 He also asserted over the weekend that many of his Republican colleagues privately tell him that his facts are correct.\par \par \uc2 Here at The Fact Checker, we place the burden on politicians to provide evidence for incendiary claims. But King's office has not responded to our queries\u8212\'20\'14or to requests from our colleagues at PolitiFact and FactCheck.org, who have also tried to vet this claim.\par \par \uc2 But King has offered clues about why he believes in this claim, so let's explore what we know. Does the math (one valedictorian to every 100 drug smugglers) even begin to add up?\par \par \uc2 The Facts\par \par \uc2 King's reference to valedictorians is likely a knock at the Democrats who highlighted one such case-- Benita Veliz of San Antonio\u8212\'20\'14at last year's Democratic National Convention. Veliz was the first undocumented immigrant who spoke at a national political convention.\par \par \uc2 King, incidentally, is wrong in saying that "you only get one valedictorian per class per year." There's actually a trend now in awarding many students with the coveted title, including more than 100 at some schools or even more than 10 percent of the class.\par \par \uc2 But this points out a basic fallacy in King's claim. He is comparing one number against another. The first figure is for valedictorians. But as far as we know, there is no figure for the number of valedictorians in any given year\u8212\'20\'14let alone the number of "DREAMer" valedictorians. So it's hard to do the math if you are missing one part of the equation (the "1").\par \par \uc2 But the second part\u8212\'20\'14the 100 who are drug smugglers\u8212\'20\'14is even more problematic. The only evidence that King has submitted for this claim is an Associated Press article that he inserted in the Congressional Record on July 24. We're not sure if King read this article very closely, because it undercuts his assertion.\par \par \uc2 Here are some of the facts in the article:\par \par \uc2 n "Between 2008 and 2011, the number of youths aged 14 to 18 caught trying to cross the border between Tijuana and San Diego to sell drugs has grown tenfold."\par \par \uc2 n "The number of youths 18 and younger detained for drug-related crimes in Mexico has climbed from 482 in 2006, when President \uc2 Felipe Calderon\uc2  launched his offensive against drug traffickers, to 810 by 2009."\par \par \uc2 Interestingly, King seemed to echo those facts when he was interviewed on CNN: "We're seeing that the numbers of those arrested have grown a multiple of 10 times over the last year and a half or so, and in Mexico, there are the multiples also, 800 to 900 a year in Mexico arrested smuggling drugs and for drug-related crimes."\par \par \uc2 But here's the problem: The article is talking about Mexican youth, not undocumented youth living in the United States. These facts have nothing to do with King's initial assertion. The only American connection in the article is a reference to Edgar Jimenez Lugo, known as "El Ponchis," who was arrested at age 14 on charges related to four drug-related murders. But Lugo was actually born a U.S. citizen, and then was mostly raised in Mexico. He is the opposite of a "DREAMer"\u8212\'20\'14someone born in another country but raised in the United States.\par \par \uc2 Indeed, a report by the Center for Investigative Reporting found that four out of five arrests for drug smuggling involve U.S. citizens, which also would exclude "DREAMers." (Note to King: these people were generally caught driving a car or truck; few people these days seem to haul marijuana over the desert by foot, cantaloupe calves or not).\par \par \uc2 Okay, you get the picture. There's no way to substantiate the other part of the equation either.\par \par \uc2 In fact, King's fact says much less than he thinks it does. Estimates suggest that there might be about 2 million people who could eventually be eligible under the DREAM Act, almost evenly split between men and women. Let's assume, for the sake of argument, that 1,000 (1/20th of one percent) are valedictorians. That would mean King assumes 100,000\u8211\'20\'13or one-tenth of all "DREAMers" or about 20 percent of the men\u8212\'20\'14are drug smugglers.\par \par \uc2 But the \uc2 American Immigration Council\uc2 , a pro-immigration group, cites a 2007 study that found that "for every ethnic group, without exception, incarceration rates among young men are lowest for immigrants, even those who are the least educated. This holds especially true for the Mexicans, Salvadorians and Guatemalans who make up the bulk of the unauthorized population."\par \par \uc2 Alternatively, maybe there are only five valedictorians, so there would be 500 smugglers\u8212\'20\'14which tells you little out of a population of 2 million people.\par \par \uc2 Even King seems to realize the numbers don't add up. In his CNN interview, King tried to back off the ratio, while at the same time asserting he was still right.\par \par \uc2 "I wasn't talking about the ratio. Border Patrol agents don't know how many valedictorians we have that are also 'DREAMers.' In fact, I don't know that the public knows either," he said. "But I can tell you it's not nearly as many as the advocates for the DREAM Act would like to have you believe."\par \par \uc2 Of course, he offered no evidence for why the percentage of valedictorians among "DREAMers" would be any less than in the general population.\par \par \uc2 The Pinocchio Test\par \par \uc2 King's claim about valedictorians and smugglers is a nonsense fact, designed to suggest an aura of authenticity to an otherwise objectionable statement. It appears King heard something, from someone he has not named, and had blown it into "facts" for which he feels little need to provide evidence.\par \par \uc2 We would certainly revisit this issue if King supplies us with additional material to bolster his claim. If a politician is going to say stuff like this, he or she has to be prepared to back it up with actual facts.\par \par \uc2 Otherwise the claim has as much authority as the number 57 in the classic movie, "The Manchurian Candidate." For readers unfamiliar with the reference, that's when the number of alleged "card-carrying communists" in the Defense Department was determined by the "57" on a Heinz Ketchup bottle.\par \par \uc2
