All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 "\uc2 Joe Biden\uc2  tried to cut Social Security and Medicare for decades. \u8230\'20\'26 Now Biden's promising your benefits to illegal immigrants."\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 Trump campaign ad, airing in battleground states\par \par \uc2 This is a confusing ad. The core of it is a misleading clip from Biden in the mid-1990s. But the tagline \u8212\'20\'14 "Now Biden's promising your benefits to illegal immigrants" \u8212\'20\'14 is a head-scratcher.\par \par \uc2 The ad cites a Fox News article from 2019 as the source for that claim. But that article recounts Biden saying he would support allowing undocumented immigrants access to health care. (The Biden campaign has a policy position that undocumented immigrants should be able to purchase insurance on the Affordable Care Act exchanges, but without receiving any subsidies.) In other words, it was not about Social Security.\par \par \uc2 Apparently, the ad is supposed to address a different point \u8212\'20\'14 that Biden proposes a pathway to citizenship for an estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants, and thus eventually they would be eligible to get Social Security.\par \par \uc2 The Facts\par \par \uc2 First, let's look at the misleading clip. Here, the Trump campaign is borrowing a talking point from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and his supporters. But the complaint lacks context \u8212\'20\'14 and is odd, coming from a Republican.\par \par \uc2 In the mid-1980s, bipartisan alarm grew over soaring federal budget deficits under President \uc2 Ronald Reagan\uc2 . Biden, working with Sens. \uc2 Charles E. Grassley\uc2  (R-Iowa), Nancy Landon Kassebaum (R-Kan.) and Max Baucus (D-Mont.), proposed a simple solution: a one-year freeze on all spending, including defense spending and social programs such as Social Security.\par \par \uc2 Biden pitched it as the "last best chance" to keep deficits from undermining the economic recovery and dropping the country into another recession. He also said it would avoid having to "make other significant changes in Medicare and significant changes in Social Security generally." The plan was rejected 33 to 65, though more Democrats than Republicans voted for it.\par \par \uc2 The Trump ad takes a clip of Biden speaking on the Senate floor in 1995, recalling that fight at a time when Republicans had taken control of the House and Senate and were pressing for passage of a balanced-budget amendment. But the ad misleadingly edits the clip to remove the context that Biden called for a freeze on all federal spending, not just Social Security and Medicare. Here's Biden's full statement, with quotes in the ad signified in bold.\par \par \uc2 "When I argued that we should freeze federal spending, I meant Social Security as well. I meant Medicare and Medicaid. I meant veterans benefits. I meant every single solitary thing in the government. And I not only tried it once. I tried it twice. I tried it a third time, and I tried it a fourth time."\par \par \uc2 Under our guide to manipulated video, this type of deceptive editing is known as omission.\par \par \uc2 What's the evidence for "Biden's promising your benefits to illegal immigrants?" It's pretty technical \u8212\'20\'14 and slim. It also involves a bit of ancient history.\par \par \uc2 People only earn Social Security benefits if they pay into the system. (Social Security is designed to provide workers with a basic level of income in retirement, as well as disability pay and life insurance while they work.)\par \par \uc2 The benefits are progressive, meaning lower-income workers get a relatively better deal than higher-income workers; however, workers making above a certain salary ($137,700 in 2020) don't have to pay as much of their income into the system, though their benefits are capped, too. The benefits are inflation-adjusted after initial receipt, a feature that is almost impossible to find in the U.S. annuity market.\par \par \uc2 The suggestion that some other worker, let alone illegal immigrants, can receive "your benefits" is simply wrong. Your benefits are established under the law, depending how long you have worked and for how much. Maybe the ad means "the same benefits," but as phrased it is misleading.\par \par \uc2 Biden has called for a path for citizenship for some 11 million undocumented immigrants \u8212\'20\'14 a standard position for a Democrat. If these people ever become citizens, they too would be eligible to earn Social Security benefits.\par \par \uc2 Undocumented workers currently are not eligible for Social Security. Yet with few exceptions, workers in the United States must pay a portion of their earnings to Social Security, which is matched by their employer. Thus workers in the country illegally who have fraudulent or unauthorized Social Security numbers are paying into the system but do not get any benefits.\par \par \uc2 Until the law was changed in 2008, the \uc2 Social Security Administration\uc2  would process claims for credit for those payments in benefit calculations if a formerly \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  became a legal resident \u8212\'20\'14 and the worker could prove he or she had made payments to the Social Security system.\par \par \uc2 When this issue was being debated in the Senate in 2006 and 2007, Biden voted to kill the amendment banning the policy once, voted against a procedural motion to block it another time and then was absent the day it was added to a spending bill. In 2013, Biden described it as "just mean" that "even if you've been working and paying into Social Security once you come out of the shadows and you are on the path to citizenship you don't get credit for all the money you paid to the government."\par \par \uc2 As a candidate, Biden does not appear to have taken a position on this issue. So there is not much of a "promise" that can be found.\par \par \uc2 The Trump campaign also points to Biden's support for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, established under Obama for the so-called Dreamers \u8212\'20\'14 undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children. After paying taxes for 10 years, like all other Social Security taxpayers, the Obama White House said, Dreamers would become eligible for Social Security. The Social Security actuary determined that the long-term actuarial balance of the Social Security Trust Funds would be "improved slightly" because of the additional payroll taxes paid by DACA workers. (Trump has sought to terminate DACA.)\par \par \uc2 "\uc2 Joe Biden\uc2  has not put forward a policy that entitles undocumented immigrants to Social Security benefits," a Biden campaign aide said. "\uc2 Joe Biden\uc2  is in support of helping families stay together by providing a road map to citizenship for undocumented immigrants in our nation. American citizens are entitled to accessing Social Security benefits that they have already paid into."\par \par \uc2 "There is no question that \uc2 Joe Biden\uc2  has openly pledged to provide government benefits to illegal immigrants, including student loans and access to his government-run health plan," Ali Pardo, the Trump campaign's deputy communications director, said in an emailed statement. "Social Security is no different. Biden supports reinstituting the unconstitutional DACA and DAPA programs, which Social Security's Chief Actuary and the Obama White House said would make illegal immigrants eligible for Social Security. Unlike Biden, President Trump will always protect Social Security and the seniors who rely on it."\par \par \uc2 The Pinocchio Test\par \par \uc2 Overall, the ad is confusing. It never mentions Biden's support of a pathway to citizenship and cites a news article about another issue, but supposedly that's the message. We suspect the Trump campaign was trying to shoehorn illegal immigration into an attack on Biden's Social Security record but did not quite pull it off.\par \par \uc2 Once undocumented immigrants become U.S. citizens or permanent residents, under the law, they eventually will be eligible to earn Social Security. Dreamers covered under DACA were also allowed to become eligible, which the Social Security actuary said would improve the long-term financial health of the program, allowing it to continue to pay full benefits. Technically, DACA recipients are still in the United States illegally, though most solutions to the issue envision a path to citizenship for people who came to here as children.\par \par \uc2 The Trump ad takes an old Biden clip out of context. That's strike one.\par \par \uc2 Then it claims Biden has promised something \u8212\'20\'14 but there is no such promise. That's strike two.\par \par \uc2 Finally, it falsely suggests illegal immigrants will receive "your" Social Security benefits. With the narrow exception of DACA recipients, they would not receive the same benefits until they become legal. That's strike three.\par \par \uc2 Four Pinocchios\par \par \uc2 (About our rating scale)\par \par \uc2 Send us facts to check by filling out this form\par \par \uc2 Sign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletter\par \par \uc2 The Fact Checker is a verified signatory to the International Fact-Checking Network code of principles\par \par \uc2 This fact check is available at IFCN's 2020 US Elections #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click here for more.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020200918eg9i001e1\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 This article was originally published on July 21, 2020.\par \par \uc2 Over the course of \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 's five-year journey from unlikely candidate to president, only one night has given him exactly what he was looking for when it began.\par \par \uc2 On July 21, 2016, he walked onto the stage at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland before a raucous crowd of supporters. He'd vanquished more than a dozen opponents, however messily, upending the party establishment and sending experienced politicians into retirement. That night was a celebration of his victory \u8212\'20\'14 one deliberately tailored to his ego. It was constrained as he wanted it to be constrained and excessive the way he wanted it to be excessive. A forest of American flags were perfectly aligned at the back of the stage under a massive screen that at one point said nothing more than exactly what Trump would have wanted it to: Trump.\par \par \uc2 In that moment, it seemed unlikely that Trump's campaign would end successfully. He trailed \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  relatively narrowly, but history suggested that his insurgent campaign would founder as the election approached. Despite his assertively unapologetic primary campaign, it seemed fair to expect that the speech he gave on that evening would attempt to establish a general-election campaign aimed at broadening his base.\par \par \uc2 It didn't. The speech Trump gave four years ago was, like so many other parts of Trump's campaign, dark, angry, deceptive and aimed at riling up the people who already supported his candidacy. He offered a slew of projections and promises that, four years later, seem as bizarre and unlikely as they did then. Importantly, he detailed an approach to the job that seemed dissonant at the time but has been an undercurrent ever since.\par \par \uc2 And, of course, he promised that he alone could fix the problems the nation faced. In November, voters will be asked to evaluate how he did.\par \par \uc2 The speech began as one might expect. Trump formally accepted the nomination and then celebrated having received more primary votes than any previous Republican nominee. It was an accomplishment boosted both by high turnout, the relatively small number of prior candidates in the modern era and the expansion of the population of the United States. But it was a metric that could be parlayed into a victory lap, and so it was.\par \par \uc2 Those niceties complete, Trump offered a concise summary of his thesis.\par \par \uc2 "Together, we will lead our party back to the White House, and we will lead our country back to safety, prosperity and peace," he said. "We will be a country of generosity and warmth. But we will also be a country of law and order."\par \par \uc2 There had been two events in the preceding several weeks that amplified that latter message. In mid-June, a man claiming loyalty to the Islamic State entered a gay nightclub in Orlando and killed more than 50 people. A few weeks later, a man in Dallas shot and killed five police officers as a Black Lives Matter protest was happening nearby.\par \par \uc2 To Trump, these weren't isolated acts of violence. They were evidence of a deep-seated danger.\par \par \uc2 "Our convention occurs at a moment of crisis for our nation," Trump continued. "The attacks on our police, and the terrorism in our cities, threaten our very way of life. Any politician who does not grasp this danger is not fit to lead our country."\par \par \uc2 He offered the country a promise.\par \par \uc2 "I have a message for all of you: The crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soon \u8212\'20\'14 and I mean very soon \u8212\'20\'14 come to an end," he said. "Beginning on January 20th, 2017, safety will be restored."\par \par \uc2 To many observers in the moment, it was a bit perplexing. Beyond the aforementioned incidents, it didn't seem as though there was any particularly chaotic situation in the country. But it served Trump's purposes to suggest that there was and that it demanded an immediate solution, so a speech that might have been expected to be an effort to embrace Democrats was instead largely a warning about what Democrats had wrought.\par \par \uc2 The pattern Trump used in elevating the issue of crime was the pattern he used over and over throughout the rest of his speech. Present and exaggerate a problem, often using cherry-picked statistics. Insist that he \u8212\'20\'14 and only he \u8212\'20\'14 could and would quickly bring it to an end. His infamous "I alone can fix it" comment that came later in the speech referred somewhat narrowly to what he presented as a thorough corruption in Washington. While the line has been regularly offered out of that context, as we did above, the sentiment it encapsulates was pervasive.\par \par \uc2 It's hard not to consider Trump's focus on crime and danger outside the context of the current moment. Trump's reelection campaign has produced ads warning that his presumptive 2020 opponent, former vice president \uc2 Joe Biden\uc2 , would preside over similarly dangerous times should he win in November. To make that point, Trump's campaign repeatedly highlights recent acts of violence \u8212\'20\'14 violence that, of course, has occurred under Trump.\par \par \uc2 Four years ago, he isolated a few data points to suggest a country growing more dangerous. He noted increases in homicides in large cities, including Chicago and Washington, something he attributed to the Obama administration's "rollback of criminal enforcement." That violent crime had reached 40-year lows under President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  went unmentioned.\par \par \uc2 In his first two years in office, the only two for which data are complete, the violent crime rate didn't drop below the low point seen under Obama. It didn't even match that low.\par \par \uc2 Trump also revisited the theme that probably earned him the nomination in the first place.\par \par \uc2 "The number of new \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  families who have crossed the border so far this year already exceeds the entire total from 2015," he said. "They are being released by the tens of thousands into our communities with no regard for the impact on public safety or resources."\par \par \uc2 He then told a story about a young woman who was killed by an undocumented immigrant, something that would become a staple of his speeches as president.\par \par \uc2 When Trump similarly focused on immigration during his speech announcing his candidacy the prior June, his announcement was viewed as a lark. So his accusations that immigrants from Mexico were criminals and rapists led to a private-sector blowback, with business partners cutting ties with the \uc2 Trump Organization\uc2  and its chief executive. That, though, elevated awareness of Trump's fiercely anti-immigrant campaign rhetoric, rhetoric that matched what conservative media outlets had been telling Republican voters but that Republican elected officials avoided both as a political calculation and, well, because it was largely false.\par \par \uc2 Trump's speech at the convention was one of a few he has given over the past five years that deliberately tried to remain within the boundaries of accuracy, territory in which Trump isn't always comfortable. ("I will present the facts plainly and honestly," Trump said. "We cannot afford to be so politically correct anymore.") Doing so meant making a relatively unremarkable situation on the border seem alarming. The number of apprehensions at the border in 2015 was also near a 40-year low. But the number of families apprehended was higher, so Trump focused on that.\par \par \uc2 After Trump took office, the number of families apprehended at the southern border first declined and then soared, pushing total apprehensions to levels not seen in decades. This was the catalyst for Trump's national-emergency declaration aimed at building a wall on the border, and thereby upholding a promise he made repeatedly in 2016, including during that speech. The number of family apprehensions soon declined (well before the wall was actually built), but the national emergency remains.\par \par \uc2 Trump then turned his attention to the economy.\par \par \uc2 Under Obama, the Great Recession, which began in 2008, ended and the nation slowly began to regain steam. Again, though, Trump cherry-picked numbers, this time highlighting data points aimed at appealing to nonwhite listeners.\par \par \uc2 "Nearly 4 in 10 African American children are living in poverty," Trump said, "while 58 percent of African American youth are now not employed. Two million more Latinos are in poverty today than when President Obama took his oath of office less than eight years ago."\par \par \uc2 That figure about African American youth is misleading, as The Washington Post has repeatedly documented. It includes anyone who isn't working at all \u8212\'20\'14 including students or others not actually looking for jobs. In 2019, by comparison, 76 percent of black Americans younger than 20 were unemployed. By pegging the Hispanic poverty level to the day Obama took office, Trump's rhetoric benefited from the fact that poverty levels lagged the economic crisis, meaning that the number of people in poverty grew after the recession ended.\par \par \uc2 In 2018, it's estimated that the rate of poverty among black children had fallen to about 30 percent. Where that figure stands in the current economic climate is unknown.\par \par \uc2 Trump also criticized Obama for the trade deficit in goods (which grew under Trump) and for increasing the national debt to more than $19 trillion. (It's now more than $26 trillion.)\par \par \uc2 "And yet, what do we have to show for it?" Trump asked. "Our roads and bridges are falling apart, our airports are Third World condition, and 43 million Americans are on food stamps."\par \par \uc2 That latter figure fell to about 36 million last year. The promised infrastructure improvements, though, failed to materialize.\par \par \uc2 After a brief riff on foreign policy, rattling off a number of Fox News-friendly accusations against Obama and Clinton (including a pointed mention of the 2012 attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya), he pivoted to his proposals.\par \par \uc2 "The problems we face now \u8212\'20\'14 poverty and violence at home, war and destruction abroad \u8212\'20\'14 will last only as long as we continue relying on the same politicians who created them in the first place," Trump said. "A change in leadership is required to get a change in outcomes. Tonight, I will share with you my plan of action for America.\par \par \uc2 "The most important difference between our plan and that of our opponent is that our plan will put America first," Trump said. "Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo."\par \par \uc2 That included an overhaul of trade policy. Voters who supported Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) would "join our movement," Trump predicted, "because we will fix his biggest single issue: trade deals that strip our country of our jobs and strip us of our wealth as a country."\par \par \uc2 Sanders supporters overwhelmingly voted for Clinton. Beyond killing the Trans-Pacific Partnership, Trump's main trade achievement was replacing the \uc2 North American Free Trade Agreement\uc2  (\uc2 NAFTA\uc2 ) with the U.S.-Canada-Mexico Agreement \u8212\'20\'14 which is mostly just an update to \uc2 NAFTA\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Some of the most jarring comments from Trump's speech center on race.\par \par \uc2 "The irresponsible rhetoric of our president, who has used the pulpit of the presidency to divide us by race and color, has made America a more dangerous environment for everyone than, frankly, I have ever seen and anybody in this room has ever watched or seen," Trump said.\par \par \uc2 Obama's administration had "failed America's inner cities," he said, using his preferred shorthand for black Americans.\par \par \uc2 "It's failed them on education," Trump said. "It's failed them on jobs. It's failed them on crime. It's failed them on every single level."\par \par \uc2 "When I am president, I will work to ensure that all of our kids are treated equally, and protected equally," he insisted. "Every action I take, I will ask myself: Does this make life better for young Americans in Baltimore, in Chicago, in Detroit, in Ferguson, who have as much of a right to live out their dreams as any other child in America?"\par \par \uc2 This is presumably part of the "generosity and warmth" Trump insisted would be part of his presidency. It can be judged as a promise on its own merits.\par \par \uc2 Trump then switched to the issue of terrorism. He pledged to eradicate the Islamic State, the last territorial vestiges of which were eliminated in early 2019. He also pledged to stamp out "Islamic terrorism" more broadly, insisting that the United States would "win fast."\par \par \uc2 To that end, he reiterated his pledge to "suspend immigration from any nation that has been compromised by terrorism until such time as proven vetting mechanisms have been put in place."\par \par \uc2 "We don't want them in our country," he added off the cuff.\par \par \uc2 As president, Trump did implement multiple versions of his travel ban, after moderating it to be less specifically about adherents of Islam.\par \par \uc2 His speech then pivoted back to immigration, looping the acceptance of refugees from conflict-ridden areas such as Syria in with immigrants crossing into the United States illegally.\par \par \uc2 "We are going to be considerate and compassionate to everyone," he said. "But my greatest compassion will be for our own struggling citizens." Another pattern: I will be nice, but, more important, I will be tough.\par \par \uc2 He has been the latter, at least. As president, Trump sharply reduced refugee immigration into the country. He moved to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which offered those who'd come to the United States illegally as children a way to remain here legally.\par \par \uc2 Trump accused Clinton of supporting policies that offered economic advantages to immigrants over U.S.-born workers, bringing him back to the economy.\par \par \uc2 "I have made billions of dollars in business making deals \u8212\'20\'14 now I'm going to make our country rich again," he said. He promised new trade deals (see above) as well as a battery of other proposals.\par \par \uc2 But governing is trickier than orating. For example, Trump said he would "bring our jobs back to Ohio and Pennsylvania and New York and Michigan and all of America." Because of the coronavirus pandemic, the number of people working in each of those states is lower than when Trump took office. In fact, it's lower than when Obama took office.\par \par \uc2 At another point, he promised he would "never, ever sign bad trade deals." Trump has expressed frustration about the parameters of the preliminary trade deal he signed with China.\par \par \uc2 On other economic points, Trump hit closer to the mark. He promised massive tax cuts, which he delivered \u8212\'20\'14 although his pledge that "middle-income Americans will experience profound relief" doesn't capture what happened, and his pledge to simplify filing was abandoned.\par \par \uc2 "We will repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare," Trump said at another point. "You will be able to choose your own doctor again."\par \par \uc2 An effort to replace the Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare, failed in the summer of 2017. Congress did repeal the individual coverage mandate it included as part of the aforementioned tax law, but as recently as Sunday, Trump was still promising that his administration would soon reveal a full replacement to the law.\par \par \uc2 He promised to help relieve student debt, which didn't happen. He promised to rebuild the military, which he often insists he did. He promised to provide veterans with the ability to choose their own doctor or hospital, something Obama had already done. He promised to get rid of the Johnson Amendment, which limits the ability of religious institutions to weigh in on politics. He says he did this, but he didn't.\par \par \uc2 After more than an hour and after recognizing his family both present and departed, Trump reached his conclusion.\par \par \uc2 "History is watching us now," he said. "It's waiting to see if we will rise to the occasion, and if we will show the whole world that America is still free and independent and strong. I'm asking for your support tonight so that I can be your champion in the White House."\par \par \uc2 He ended with the now-familiar refrain: "We will Make America Great Again!"\par \par \uc2 But his actual conclusion, the moment in which he most fully summarized his feelings in the moment, came a bit before that, as he was winding up to the soaring rhetoric plugged into his teleprompter.\par \par \uc2 "Remember: All of the people telling you that you can't have the country you want are the same people that wouldn't stand" \u8212\'20\'14 a brief stumble \u8212\'20\'14 "I mean, they said Trump doesn't have a chance of being here tonight," Trump said, ad-libbing. "Not a chance! The same people. Oh, we love defeating those people, don't we? Love it, love it, love it."\par \par \uc2 That was what Trump was there to celebrate. A few minutes later, he was onstage with wife Melania Trump and Mike and \uc2 Karen Pence\uc2 , and balloons were falling and people were shouting and clapping and hurrahing at the four of them and their families.\par \par \uc2 It's hard to imagine that Trump has enjoyed any moment more in the four years since.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020200827eg8r005k1\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

Binder \par \uc2 1,126 \uc2 words\par \uc2 19 February 2020\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2020, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 President Trump's fervent base of supporters is concentrated among whites over 50 years old, whites without college degrees and white evangelicals. But Trump also appeals to some (but not all) younger, more educated voters, many still in college \u8212\'20\'14 the cohort that is likely to lead conservatism in the future.\par \par \uc2 As it happens, different strains of right-leaning activism on college campuses are engaged in a bitter contest for domination. So, what's coming to the main stage of U.S. conservative politics in the coming years? Here's what you need to know.\par \par \uc2 The internal battles of campus conservatism have changed\par \par \uc2 During the 2016 election, several prominent chapters of the College Republicans denounced Trump's nomination. Many others chose not to formally endorse his candidacy. While these chapters are technically independent of the Republican Party, they usually maintain close ties with the local and state GOP \u8212\'20\'14 making the snubs significant.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, other campus political clubs rose up to promote Trump and his politics. An organization called Turning Point USA, for example, attracted attention through headline-grabbing tactics and a wholehearted embrace of the president and his administration. Similarly, Young America's Foundation, or YAF, has spent years holding provocative campus events like "Catch an \uc2 Illegal Immigrant\uc2  Day" and "Affirmative Action Bake Sales."\par \par \uc2 Moderate and traditional campus conservatives have lost ground as populists and nationalists (as well as more forthright racists) have begun showing up. Yesterday's fire-breathing conservatives are finding themselves dismayed by those who want to go still further to the right.\par \par \uc2 Turning Point and YAF had until recently been at the furthest-right edge of conservative activism in higher education. Over the past several months, however, Turning Point and YAF have been attacked for failing to espouse the more extreme "America First" populism advocated by figures like conservative columnist Michelle Malkin and conservative podcaster Nick Fuentes. Fuentes and his followers, called the "Groyper Army," made waves last year by heckling \uc2 Donald Trump Jr\uc2 . at UCLA and \uc2 Rep. Dan Crenshaw\uc2  (R-Tex.) at \uc2 Arizona State University\uc2 . "Groyper" refers to a variant of Pepe the Frog, an illustrated meme appropriated by the alt-right.\par \par \uc2 Fuentes claimed that Trump and Crenshaw were not anti-immigrant enough, supported Israel too much and did not adequately denounce the LBGTQ community. Malkin positioned herself as Fuentes's ardent backer \u8212\'20\'14 which led YAF to cut ties with her.\par \par \uc2 Here's how we did our research\par \par \uc2 Between the fall of 2017 and the spring of 2018, the first full school year Trump was in office, we visited the flagship public universities of Arizona, Colorado, North Carolina and Virginia to learn about young people involved in contentious campus political events.\par \par \uc2 Our 77 student interviewees were activists involved with political clubs on their campuses. We sat down with anarchists and communists, libertarians and populists, and everyone in between to ask open-ended questions about the direction of American democracy, the value they put on civic debate and their feelings about civil dialogue.\par \par \uc2 Trump, unsurprisingly, loomed large in their minds. Progressives were universally opposed to the current president. Not all conservatives were ardent Trump fans; students on the right were divided on how to respond to Trump and unsure of what his leadership meant for the Republican Party.\par \par \uc2 We observed that students' approaches to politics were shaped by the clubs they participated in. Political groups don't just reflect their members' interests. They provide a context and a set of "styles" that help mold students' ideologies and beliefs about the norms of activism.\par \par \uc2 Consider the University of Virginia's College Republicans, a chapter that has focused on training future party leaders. Members described how belonging to the group tempered their more extreme impulses. Meeting and working for politicians helped them appreciate electability over fiery rhetoric, while debating public policy with visiting experts led them to see compromise as a way toward the greater good.\par \par \uc2 Turning Point had the opposite effect, centering group membership on making provocative claims and publicly inciting outrage. As one University of North Carolina Turning Point member complained, "I don't see any leadership from the College Republicans for doing any type of activism work on campus or trying to persuade anyone [to vote for Trump] or get people riled up to go out and do stuff. \u8230\'20\'26 [College Republicans] don't really like to be controversial at all."\par \par \uc2 Getting "people riled up," for this campus club, included going to anti-gun rallies to hand out \uc2 NRA\uc2  tchotchkes and inviting white nationalists to speak. But the national leadership of Turning Point distanced itself from the chapter's more alt-right activities. Nevertheless, members explained that their chapter would not be deterred from countering UNC's "bias against white people."\par \par \uc2 Now, the provokers are being out-provoked\par \par \uc2 Activists across a variety of conservative groups explained how Turning Point normalized a vision of conservatism that resonated with Trump's approach to campaigning and governing, embracing populism and emphasizing provocation to create viral social media content as the right's primary strategy on campus.\par \par \uc2 Two years later, many College Republican chapters are now following in Turning Point's footsteps and running toward Trumpism \u8212\'20\'14 by which we mean not only supporting the current president but also replicating the political stylings of his campaign rhetoric.\par \par \uc2 But the tide could turn quickly.\par \par \uc2 Although the Groyper critique of "Conservative Inc." may push College Republicans, Turning Point and even Trump's own son to be Trumpier, the ideological shift could be short-lived. Other political swings have been reversed. After President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 's reelection, for example, College Republicans headed the opposite way, promising to make the GOP more inclusive, an approach now abandoned. In other words, searing moments \u8212\'20\'14 like the election of an African American or a reality TV star to the presidency \u8212\'20\'14 can upend conventional wisdom in a heartbeat.\par \par \uc2 Student-led groups do have a cultural inertia that can remain even as membership changes. At the same time, any one club's trajectory is negotiable. It is hard to predict where conservative students will end up in four years, but the College Republicans' current course represents a radical departure from the pragmatic "socially liberal, fiscally conservative" mantra we heard in interview after interview when we were talking with students during Trump's first full school year in office.\par \par \uc2 Don't miss anything!

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 This is what we've come to.\par \par \uc2 The publisher of a novel titled "American Dirt," by Jeanine Cummins, has canceled the remainder of a national book tour because Cummins and the bookstores set to host her have received threats of physical violence.\par \par \uc2 This is what we've come to. In the United States of America.\par \par \uc2 More than 30 years after the Ayatollah Khomeini issued a fatwa demanding the assassination of Salman Rushdie for writing "The Satanic Verses," here we are terrorizing one of our own novelists.\par \par \uc2 If you've been distracted lately by the presidential impeachment trial, you may have missed this tertiary symptom of the collapse of our democracy.\par \par \uc2 "American Dirt" was published last week in a paroxysm of rage and praise that racked the literati and generated almost 50,000 hardcover sales in its first five days.\par \par \uc2 Cummins's novel tells the story of a Mexican bookstore owner named Lydia and her 8-year-old son trying to escape a poem-writing drug lord. The novel opens with his men killing 16 members of Lydia's family during a quincea\u241\'00\'F1era, and now they want to finish the job. With gunshots ringing in their ears, Lydia and her boy flee. They sneak onto buses, they jump onto moving trains, they trudge across deadly deserts, hoping against hope to reach the promised land: America.\par \par \uc2 It's just a melodramatic thriller tarted up with flowery ornaments and freighted with earnest political relevance. The book might have fallen unremarked into the great vat of sentimental suspense fiction that New York pumps out every year, except for an unprecedented collision of promotion and denunciation.\par \par \uc2 Early on, the publisher, Flatiron, a division of Macmillan, decided to aim for the stars. It reportedly paid more than a million dollars for "American Dirt," which isn't so much an estimate of its value as an investment in the future publicity that such an absurd advance inevitably generates in Places That Matter. Flatiron determined that "American Dirt" would not just be another thriller; it would be the defining novel of the immigrant experience \u8212\'20\'14 an emotional story powerful enough to galvanize the sympathy of a nation. An Olympian field of blurbers was assembled, including John Grisham, Stephen King, Ann Patchett, Julia Alvarez and Sandra Cisneros. Don Winslow called it "a 'Grapes of Wrath' for our time," which is ludicrous but hardly out of bounds in the make-believe realm of blurbs. Movie rights were sold. \uc2 Barnes & Noble\uc2  picked it for the chain's national book club. And finally, Oprah announced that "American Dirt" was her next book club pick.\par \par \uc2 But more than a month ago, long before most of us had heard of this book, Chicana writer Myriam Gurba posted a take-no-prisoners review on a website titled Tropics of Meta. Gurba exposed the novel's cliches, stereotypes and clumsiness, and then she went after Cummins for appropriating the story of Mexican migrants and exploiting their suffering. It's a fierce critique, full of insight and anger \u8212\'20\'14 the kind of urgency one almost never sees in the pages of the nation's hand-patting book reviews. Other writers noticed \u8212\'20\'14 particularly people of color \u8212\'20\'14 and by the time the novel was released on Jan. 21, the Internet was full of smart commentary that not only delineated the flaws in "American Dirt" but also the deleterious effects of baking mawkish racial stereotypes in sweet nuggets for a largely white, ill-informed audience. Other commentators pointed out the problems in a publishing community that could so enthusiastically promote such a flawed novel. And some writers helpfully suggested better novels and works of nonfiction about migrants and the border crisis.\par \par \uc2 That's how the cultural system is supposed to work. It was heartening to see people so engaged with a work of fiction. But the cruel design of our attention-based economy means that we end up promoting loudest what we hate most.\par \par \uc2 And in the current climate, hate quickly becomes weaponized. Gurba told Vox this week that she had received death threats after posting her review of "American Dirt." And the ad hominem comments about Cummins flying around the Web have been brutal. From the start, too much of the discussion of this mediocre novel has been snarled up in identity politics \u8212\'20\'14 a poisonous tendency encouraged by the author herself. In a pleading afterword to "American Dirt," Cummins confesses that she wished "someone slightly browner than me would write it."\par \par \uc2 Cummins has been attacked for exaggerating her ethnic background and for failing to note that her Irish husband \u8212\'20\'14 once an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  \u8212\'20\'14 didn't belong to a sufficiently repressed minority group. (That complaint is so clouded by historical amnesia that I don't know where to start.) Listening to the anger directed at Cummins for having only one Latina grandparent, I suppose future novelists will have to submit their manuscripts along with a \uc2 23andMe\uc2  genetic profile.\par \par \uc2 More than 120 prominent writers \u8212\'20\'14 many of whom I idolize \u8212\'20\'14 signed a petition this week asking Oprah to cancel her book club selection because, they write, "American Dirt" "has not been imagined well nor responsibly, nor has it been effectively researched." Such judgments on this novel have and should be made, but now, to read "American Dirt" or even to tolerate others reading it is to risk being regarded as a participant in its "harmful" effect.\par \par \uc2 I heard Cummins speak at a Politics and Prose bookstore last week. The friendly, standing-room-only audience included her old neighbors, friends, teachers and even the mayor of Gaithersburg, Md., where she was raised. Cummins began by saying, sometimes through tears, that her father died while she was working on "American Dirt," and the relationship between her protagonists reflects the love between her and her dad. She went on to explain that the trauma described in the novel was informed by the pain her brother suffered during a horrific crime in St. Louis that almost killed him and left her two cousins gang raped and murdered.\par \par \uc2 Although she claimed not to have read the negative critiques of "American Dirt," she was clearly cognizant of the complaints \u8212\'20\'14 and she wasn't timid about pushing back. "I did five years of research," she said. "I went to the border. I went to Mexico. I traveled throughout the borderlands. I visited Casa del Migrante in Mexico. I visited orphanages. I volunteered at a desayunador, which is like a soup kitchen for migrants. I met with the people who have devoted their lives on the front line to the work of protecting vulnerable people. .\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09. And despite the fact that it has grown into this crazy moment that I never anticipated and that feels as if I'm in the eye of the hurricane, I know for a fact that this book is moving people."\par \par \uc2 It's worth recalling an earlier melodramatic thriller tarted up with flowery ornaments and freighted with earnest political relevance by a white woman named Harriet Beecher Stowe. We can debate how egregiously Stowe appropriated the lives of black people and exploited their suffering, but President \uc2 Abraham Lincoln\uc2  said that "Uncle Tom's Cabin" sparked the Civil War. If "American Dirt" similarly motivates some Americans to fight against this country's immoral immigration actions along the southern border, then more power to Cummins.\u160\'00\'A0And once engaged in that struggle, these readers might move on to better books.\par \par \uc2 But some detractors are determined to short-circuit such a possibility \u8212\'20\'14 or any discussion sparked by this novel. Fortunately, Flatiron remains committed to serious debate. Although Cummins's bookstore tour has been canceled, the publisher has announced plans to conduct town hall meetings involving Cummins and "some of the groups who have raised objections to the book." Let's hope those discussions can move forward without bullying, intimidation or violence.\par \par \uc2 The co-owner of Politics and Prose, Lissa Muscatine, articulated that goal when she introduced Cummins last week. She noted that "American Dirt" raises questions such as: "Who is entitled to tell whose story? What is the purpose of literary fiction? Does a white-dominated publishing world perpetuate cultural bias in its choices of authors and books to promote?" Before turning over the microphone to Cummins, she reminded us, "Here at P and P, our only requirement is that we all remain respectful and generous as we listen to and hear from one another, even when we disagree."\par \par \uc2 How grotesquely that modest requirement of liberal society has been soiled this week. And we can't blame the threats against Cummins on President Trump's race-baiting rhetoric or his obscene immigration abuses. The best critics of "American Dirt" are clearly motivated by a desire to defend the integrity of Mexican culture and the humanity of our most vulnerable residents. But in today's toxic atmosphere, those valuable critiques have been drowned out by a cowardly chorus of violence.\par \par \uc2 This is what we've come to. And it's terrifying.\par \par \uc2 ron.charles@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 Ron Charles writes about books for The Washington Post and hosts TotallyHipVideoBookReview.com.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020200130eg1u004xt\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 BookWorld\par {\*\bkmkstart toc5}{\*\bkmkend toc5}\b \uc2 What to read in 2020 based on the books you loved in 2019\b0\par\par\uc2 By Angela Haupt \par \uc2 1,149 \uc2 words\par \uc2 30 December 2019\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2019, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 If you read it and loved it in 2019, read more like it in 2020. Here are 12 books, from a variety of genres, to consider based on recent favorites.\par \par \uc2 If you enjoyed "City of Girls," by Elizabeth Gilbert, read "The Forgotten Letters of Esther Durrant," by Kayte Nunn (March 3)\par \par \uc2 In 1951, young mother Esther Durrant thought she was going on vacation; instead, her husband committed her to a mental asylum on a remote island. Nearly seven decades later, a feisty marine scientist takes shelter there and discovers a suitcase of long-lost love letters. The book's narration alternates between the '50s and the present, unfolding a family mystery and, ultimately, a love story.\par \par \uc2 If you enjoyed "All This Could Be Yours," by Jami Attenberg, read "All Adults Here," by Emma Straub (May 5)\par \par \uc2 There are three generations of Stricks at the center of Straub's new novel: Astrid, a 60-something widow and newly out bisexual; her three adult children; and her teenage granddaughter, Cecelia. After witnessing a bus accident, Astrid is grappling with the notion that perhaps she wasn't quite the parent she imagined herself to be \u8212\'20\'14 and everyone else is struggling to figure out, well, everything else. Prepare for a smart, of-the-moment take on a family in turmoil.\par \par \uc2 If you enjoyed "Know My Name," by Chanel Miller, read "Whistleblower," by \uc2 Susan Fowler\uc2  (Feb. 18)\par \par \uc2 In 2017, then-25-year-old \uc2 Susan Fowler\uc2  wrote a blog post about the "very, very strange year" she spent as an engineer at Uber \u8212\'20\'14 rocking Silicon Valley with accusations of sexual harassment and retaliation. It went viral and started a reckoning: Uber's chief executive and 20 additional employees were forced out, and other tech companies began looking inward. In her memoir, Fowler, who's remained mostly quiet since then, opens up about the decision to share her story and the ramifications of going public.\par \par \uc2 If you enjoyed "Evvie Drake Starts Over," by Linda Holmes, read "In Five Years," by Rebecca Serle (March 3)\par \par \uc2 Dannie Cohan, a Type A lawyer, gets engaged right on time \u8212\'20\'14 of course she does; it's part of her five-year plan. But she wakes up afterward in a different apartment with a very different man, which is not part of the plan, even if he is attractive.

\par\par \uc2 Magazine\par {\*\bkmkstart toc6}{\*\bkmkend toc6}\b \uc2 The Democrats are moving left. Will America follow? 32 perspectives on the party's dramatic turn \b0\par\par\uc2 By Richard Just \par \uc2 12,097 \uc2 words\par \uc2 18 November 2019\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2019, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Perhaps the great unknown of 2020 is how the tenor of the Democratic nomination contest will affect the general election. The outcome of the primaries and caucuses, of course, is far from clear \u8212\'20\'14 the nominee may ultimately lean to the center or the left \u8212\'20\'14 but what is clear is that the party has shifted in fundamental ways since the last presidential election. You can see it in the policy positions being discussed and embraced by Democrats, many of which go well beyond the positions taken by previous Democratic presidents and nominees \u8212\'20\'14 from banning private insurance to free college to a wealth tax to the Green New Deal. You can see it in the left-populist worldviews and solid poll numbers of two of the three leading candidates, Sens. Elizabeth Warren and \uc2 Bernie Sanders\uc2 . And you can see it in the substantial popularity among the Democratic rank-and-file of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and her allies in Congress.\par \par \uc2  In this issue of the magazine, journalists, wonks, activists and politicians \u8212\'20\'14 from a variety of ideological perspectives \u8212\'20\'14 reflect on how all of this might play out in the months and years to come, and how Americans should feel about it. \u8212\'20\'14 Richard Just\par \par \uc2 It\u8217\'20\'19s about time Democrats moved left\par \par \uc2 By Brittney Cooper\par \par \uc2 Since 2011, we have watched a spate of social movements \u8212\'20\'14 the Arab Spring, SlutWalk, Occupy Wall Street, Black Lives Matter, the Women's March and #MeToo \u8212\'20\'14 remind Americans of how essential protest is to shoring up the integrity of democratic politics. If you understand the history this way, Democrats have taken a decade to arrive at what has by all accounts been a pretty raucous party, what with flesh-baring feminists demanding sexual autonomy, young black folks fighting the power again, and radical white kids mad as hell about capitalism robbing them of their American Dreams. To the Democrats' credit, they have made a fashionably late entrance, bringing the power of formal and established American politics to a table set by those who usually, to paraphrase \uc2 Shirley Chisholm\uc2 , have to bring their own chair.\par \par \uc2 When we ask the question of whether Americans will follow, it begets for me a different question: Which Americans do you mean? Young Americans of all races, and especially those of color, have been sounding the death knell of capitalist excess since they formed the first encampments in New York's Zuccotti Park. When we see presidential candidates laying out policies and affirming their belief in reproductive justice, reparations and Medicare-for-all, this leftward shift is the direct result of the leadership of 21st-century rabble-rousers and dissenters. The question of whether Americans will follow really asks whether older generations, baby boomers in particular, will get on board with a vision that fundamentally challenges their belief in the myth of American meritocracy \u8212\'20\'14 that if you work hard, you can have everything you want. The country simply does not work that way for undocumented folks, for black folks, for the poor, or for trans people.\par \par \uc2 Do I believe Americans will follow? Americans like me \u8212\'20\'14 first-generation college kids, 40-year-old xennials squeezed by the care-taking of children and elders, and those mortified by the persistence of patriarchy, our brazen return to violent white nationalism and our swift if predictable descent into fascism \u8212\'20\'14 absolutely will. It's the only way to a future in which we all get to live and thrive.\par \par \uc2 Brittney Cooper is an associate professor of women's and gender studies and Africana studies at \uc2 Rutgers University\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The left isn\u8217\'20\'19t making it easy to vote Democratic\par \par \uc2 By \uc2 Linda Chavez\par \par \uc2 For conservatives like me who are alarmed at President Trump's unprecedented assaults on the Constitution, the unthinkable has become a near imperative. For the first time since 1968, when I voted for Vice President Hubert Humphrey, I may cast a vote for a Democrat for president. In the last election, I wrote in my own Republican preference \u8212\'20\'14 \uc2 Marco Rubio\uc2  \u8212\'20\'14 but this time, the stakes are simply too high to throw away my vote. The Democrats aren't making my choice easier.\par \par \uc2 The Democratic Party's lurch to the left will undermine what should be a chance to win against a deeply unpopular president. Trump has exploded the national debt and is running deficits unheard of outside major wars. But Democrats' plans for trillions of dollars in spending on everything from climate change to free college to expanded Medicare-for-all with no way to pay for it is a turnoff for voters who wouldn't think of buying a bigger house or a new car if they couldn't afford it. Yet perhaps the biggest problem for Democrats is cultural: They are tone deaf when it comes to the values that matter to many religious and socially conservative voters, including significant numbers of Latinos and blacks.\par \par \uc2 Sen. Elizabeth Warren's snarky reply at a recent debate about what she would tell a faith voter who believes marriage should be between one man and one woman was a case in point: "I'm going to assume it's a guy who said that. And I'm going to say, 'Then just marry one woman,' '' she said, capping off with, "assuming you can find one." \uc2 Beto O'Rourke\uc2  upped the ante, saying his administration would take tax-exempt status away from churches and organizations that did not recognize same-sex marriage. On abortion, even \uc2 Joe Biden\uc2 , who previously opposed government funding of abortions, has changed his stance in the face of the Democratic Party's uncompromising opposition to any restrictions on the procedure. These positions may be popular in Democratic primaries, but come November 2020, they could help ensure \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 's reelection.\par \par \uc2 Linda Chavez\uc2  is a senior fellow at the Niskanen Center.\par \par \uc2 Rural Americans will welcome this shift\par \par \uc2 By Elizabeth Catte\par \par \uc2 On an electoral map, I live in Staunton, Va., a dot of blue in a sea of red \u8212\'20\'14 a small city surrounded by a large rural county that should be, according to conventional political wisdom, filled with the kind of unexciting, middle-of-the-road voters that \uc2 Joe Biden\uc2  dreams of and the centrist wing of the Democratic Party mythologizes. Our local Democratic candidates, hampered by gerrymandering, lose gracefully to their Republican rivals. Our assistance to the Democrats in state and national elections is reliable but delivered in modest numbers. We are the kind of people the party likes to seek donations from but never listen to. We are folks who know our place.\par \par \uc2 Except in 2019, our local Democrats decided to write their own platform, to step up and articulate a vision amid what to them felt like an absence of coherent principles and values from the national party. As working issues, their platform included the abolition of \uc2 Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2 , divestment from fossil fuels, universal health care, total student loan forgiveness and the repeal of right-to-work laws. Their collective direction on more than 60 issues covered by the new platform puts our local organization squarely to the left of both the state and national party, as well as many of the current primary candidates. It was adopted by a unanimous vote.\par \par \uc2 Nationally, with an eye toward 2020, Sens. \uc2 Bernie Sanders\uc2  and Elizabeth Warren are the best hope for the left on the narrow electoral terms through which they might succeed. They will face a dangerous terrain where voter apathy will collide with voter suppression and modern misinformation campaigns from the right. Godspeed to them both. But ordinary Americans, not elected representatives or political parties, are at the forefront of progressive politics in the United States. If the Democrats are moving left, it is because they are following, not leading.\par \par \uc2 Elizabeth Catte is a public historian and author of "What You Are Getting Wrong About Appalachia."\par \par \uc2 The necessity and political savvy of the Green New Deal\par \par \uc2 By \uc2 Bill McKibben\par \par \uc2 On climate change, the party is not moving left \u8212\'20\'14 it's moving to where the populace is, especially those segments of it under the age of 40. The polling shows a spiking level of concern, which is about what one would expect in a nation ever more buffeted by the effects of rising temperatures. No one who watched a city literally called Paradise turn into hell last year has forgotten those images; the farmers who endured the wettest year in American history and couldn't get tractors into the field know better than most how fast the world is changing.\par \par \uc2 And they all know how little the government has done to face this crisis. In fact, some surveys show that President Trump and the Republicans are more out of touch with popular sentiment on the environment than on anything else.\par \par \uc2 That's why all the thinking that falls under the general rubric of the Green New Deal is so smart. It understands the climate crisis as a lens through which to view the world \u8212\'20\'14 a chance to address not only its rising temperature but the rising inequality that roils our politics. If your own life is insecure, it's harder to imagine change of the kind we need to deal with this moment. Ideas like a federal job guarantee for anyone who wants to help with the renewables transition are important precisely because they give people a chance to get their feet on the ground.\par \par \uc2 It all comes with political danger, of course. If the history of the past 30 years teaches us anything, it's that those in the fossil fuel industry will do all they can to defend their business model, and since they more or less own one of our political parties, expect endless diatribes about taking away your hamburgers. Up against the growing press of flood and fire, however, I think and hope they'll fail.\par \par \uc2 Bill McKibben\uc2  is an environmentalist and author of, most recently, "Falter: Has the Human Game Begun to Play Itself Out?"\par \par \uc2 For the lockdown generation, it\u8217\'20\'19s about lives \u8212\'20\'14 not left or right\par \par \uc2 By \uc2 Emma Gonz\u225\'00\'E1lez\par \par \uc2 Young Americans have plenty of reasons to be scared, anxious and mad as hell. Adults and elected officials have done basically nothing to address the gun violence in our country, and the problems we face are only getting worse. Our country's addiction to guns has created a culture of violence that has taken the lives of far too many \u8212\'20\'14 nearly 40,000 in 2017, the most recent year for which complete data is available, and the highest annual total in 50 years. It has touched not only my community, but communities everywhere.\par \par \uc2 Many have called our generation the lockdown generation, but this problem has existed long before us. However, it is up to us to elect people who value life over politics. We aren't looking for someone on the left or on the right; we are looking for someone who will help us move forward. Our generation has lost its childhood due to gun violence and injustice. We have grown up afraid to exist. Yet, in our fear and our anger, we find strength and the courage to fight. While our innocence has been lost to unspeakable violence and ever-deepening grief, we haven't lost our ability to speak up and speak out.\par \par \uc2 Our power comes from knowing that our voices and our votes have shifted a narrative and a nation to bring needed change at local and national levels. In response to an epidemic of gun-related suicides and mass shootings, March for Our Lives wrote "The Peace Plan for a Safer America" \u8212\'20\'14 a comprehensive plan to cut gun violence deaths in half in 10 years. Twenty thousand lives could be saved annually.\par \par \uc2 Each day is a march. Each day is our chance to be heard and to stand for our rights. We deserve to live free of fear. We deserve to live free of gun violence.\par \par \uc2 Emma Gonz\u225\'00\'E1lez\uc2  is a co-founder of March for Our Lives.\par \par \uc2 The far left is too pessimistic about the American Dream\par \par \uc2 By Avik Roy\par \par \uc2 If you spend a lot of time watching cable news, it's easy to conclude that Americans are hopelessly divided about what our country stands for. But we're actually deeply united on a fundamental American principle: the principle of equal opportunity for all. \uc2 Bill Clinton\uc2  used to say, "If you work hard and play by the rules, you should be given a chance to go as far as your God-given ability will take you." \uc2 Ronald Reagan\uc2  said, "The American dream [is] that wealth is denied to no one, that each individual has the right to fly as high as his strength and ability will take him." It's no accident that both Clinton and Reagan were popular two-term presidents.\par \par \uc2 One of the major differences between the far left and the rest of the country is that the far left is deeply pessimistic about the state of equal opportunity. A survey by a group called More in Common found that 54 percent of Americans agreed that "people who work hard can find success no matter what situation they were born into." By contrast, just 5 percent of "Progressive Activists" \u8212\'20\'14 the poll's most left-leaning respondents \u8212\'20\'14 agreed with this statement.\par \par \uc2 It's not surprising that some Democratic presidential contestants reflect this pessimism. There remain inequalities of opportunity, such as the persistence of poverty among African Americans, and the decreasing affordability of health care, housing and college.\par \par \uc2 But hard work still succeeds in America. There are 1.4 million more job openings in America than there are unemployed people. American entrepreneurs have given us access to previously unimaginable goods and services, and our political leaders can open up more areas for innovation.\par \par \uc2 Voters have always rewarded politicians of both parties who have faith in the American Dream. This was true in 1980, it was true in 2008, and it will be true in 2020.\par \par \uc2 Avik Roy is president of the Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity, an Austin-based think tank.\par \par \uc2 Only progressive economics can stop future Trumps\par \par \uc2 By \uc2 Dani Rodrik\par \par \uc2 Somewhat less than a third of likely voters say they will support President Trump in the 2020 election regardless of the Democratic Party nominee, according to the annual American Values Survey, conducted in recent months by the Public Religion Research Institute. This leaves more than two-thirds of the electorate up for grabs.\par \par \uc2 Whether progressive candidates on the left \u8212\'20\'14 Elizabeth Warren and \uc2 Bernie Sanders\uc2  \u8212\'20\'14 can claim a large enough share of these potential swing voters will depend less on inherent ideological predispositions than on the framing of the policy issues. True, the term "socialism" evokes mostly negative connotations among Republican-leaning voters. At the same time, according to the PRRI survey, nearly half (47 percent) of Republicans think "progressive" describes them somewhat or very well. And health care and jobs are two of the top three critical issues for uncommitted Americans. (The other is terrorism.)\par \par \uc2 Academic studies show that the disappearance of good jobs and attendant economic anxieties are key drivers behind the rejection of centrist politicians at the polls in both the United States and Europe. The areas of the country that went for Trump in 2016 after having voted for \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  in 2008 and 2012 lagged significantly behind the rest of the country in expanding employment and economic opportunity. Their relative position has continued to deteriorate in the first two years of Trump's administration.\par \par \uc2 Trump won in those "flipped counties" by wrapping a nativist narrative around their residents' discontent. A progressive Democratic candidate would instead offer remedies that directly treat the causes \u8212\'20\'14 by redressing fundamental power imbalances in the economy and through public investment in education, social programs, infrastructure and job creation financed by more-progressive taxation.\par \par \uc2 The choice that the Democratic Party faces is this: It can treat \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  as an aberration and prop up an economic regime that reproduces the status quo ante with cosmetic fixes. Or it can treat Trump as a symptom of an unsustainably unjust economic system that needs to be reformed at its core. Only the latter path will prevent the emergence of future Trumps.\par \par \uc2 Dani Rodrik\uc2  is a professor at the \uc2 Harvard Kennedy School\uc2  and co-director of Economics for Inclusive Prosperity.\par \par \uc2 Americans want a break from chaos \u8212\'20\'14 but also something more\par \par \uc2 By Marcia Davis\par \par \uc2 As a journalist, I'm not in the prediction business. It's too early to say what will happen in the Democratic nomination contest. Yet here is what I do know: American voters want more.\par \par \uc2 Even those folks who are supporters of President Trump want more, whether they know it or not. And I'm not talking about those folks who would like black and brown people, and others of color, to float away. I'm talking about the salvageable people. And there are more than a few, including those folks who voted for Trump on the down low.\par \par \uc2 The president's chaotic leadership style is exhausting. In some ways, this impeachment business is representative of that fatigue. We see the \uc2 U.S. House of Representatives\uc2  is gearing up to send articles of impeachment to the Senate, but I'm not anticipating a vote for his removal.\par \par \uc2 People who will be voting Democratic \u8212\'20\'14 including some independents, some "Never-Trumpers" and dyed-in-the-wool Dems \u8212\'20\'14 will be voting for a breather, a chance for calm. They want a break from all the chaos.\par \par \uc2 But many Democratic voters want more. They're looking for real help on health-care costs. Opportunity and job training. Immigration reform. Some help on education. And women's equality. (It's time, too, for a female president.) More effort on criminal justice. Real work on climate change. And they'd like some restoration of the country's international reputation.\par \par \uc2 Will Americans follow the Democratic Party's shift to the left? Yes. The question is just how much of a shift we are talking about. Either American voters will sink into an abyss of a downward spiral, or they will climb upward. Democratic voters aren't ready to storm the barricades, but they are ready to take the stairs, at least two at a time, to meaningful social change.\par \par \uc2 Americans want normalcy. But they also want progress.\par \par \uc2 Marcia Davis is a writer in Washington and a former articles editor and writer at the Post Magazine.\par \par \uc2 The shift to the left will work \u8212\'20\'14 if everyone can vote\par \par \uc2 By Rebecca Solnit\par \par \uc2 I'd invert this question to say: America is far to the left of its political representation, and if we're lucky the Democrats will catch up with us. That is, the Americans who are eligible to vote believe far more sincerely in the importance of climate action, human rights and equality, social services, gun control and economic justice than the Americans who actually do vote. That's often cast as "why didn't those young/brown/black/poor people vote" by people uninterested in the answer. We know the answer.\par \par \uc2 Decades ago, Republicans faced a choice: They could adapt to an increasingly nonwhite America and try to win votes from people of color, or they could do their damnedest to prevent those people from voting. As we all know, they chose the second option. Former Kansas secretary of state \uc2 Kris Kobach\uc2 's Interstate Voter Registration Crosscheck program was a cynical means to remove legitimate voters from the rolls, as are some red states' new tactic of striking from the rolls anyone who didn't vote in a recent election. Voter identification laws disproportionately affected poor, nonwhite people. In many places, polls were closed, forcing voters to travel great distances; poorer places often had shoddy equipment; college students and people in poor precincts sometimes had to wait in line for hours \u8212\'20\'14 if they could afford to miss class or work or have someone watch the kids while they did so. As of 2016, 6 million citizens with felony convictions had their right to vote taken away \u8212\'20\'14 in Florida that meant 1 in 5 black voters before the laws were changed in 2018.\par \par \uc2 The country we live in has been shaped by the choices made by a disproportionately older, whiter, wealthier electorate \u8212\'20\'14 which is to say, more conservative. If this were a country where registering to vote and voting were protected as they should be, the voice of the voters would be heard. And that voice, or rather those voices, would choose to respond meaningfully to climate change, protect the most vulnerable and defend human rights. So the first job of a progressive agenda for 2020 is to protect the right to vote.\par \par \uc2 San Francisco writer, historian and activist Rebecca Solnit is the author of more than 20 books about geography, community, art, politics, hope and feminism. Her recent works include "Whose Story Is This? Old Conflicts, New Chapters" and a forthcoming memoir, "Recollections of My Nonexistence."\par \par \uc2 The case for cultural moderation\par \par \uc2 By Jonathan Rauch\par \par \uc2 I'll take the liberty of rephrasing the question two ways. First: "Democratic primary voters are moving left. Will the general electorate follow?" In 2020, the answer is: very possibly, even probably. But not because the general electorate is on board with the Sanders-Warren-AOC worldview; rather, it's because the voters get only two choices, and the alternative is \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 . His "Make America Great Again" base, though intense, is too small to carry him to a second term. He needs a contingent of pragmatic-minded voters, and he may be alienating them to the point where they will take a chance on a normally-too-far-left Democrat.\par \par \uc2 Which begs a second version of the question: "Democrats are moving left on economic and cultural issues. Will the country follow?" There, the likeliest answers are: definitely yes and probably no. In 2020, no one with a shot at winning (sorry, Bill Weld) is campaigning on a free-market, small-government agenda, because there's no demand for one. Trump's own economic agenda \u8212\'20\'14 big spending, big deficits, trade protectionism, interventionist subsidies \u8212\'20\'14 confirms the bipartisan collapse of Reagan-Thatcherism (except on tax cuts). On cultural issues, however, the country is not swinging left but bifurcating. Big coastal cities and college-educated voters are going one way; rural and heartland places and working-class voters are going the other. Younger voters are more culturally left-leaning, but a lot of minority voters are culturally conservative, so demographic change won't settle this argument anytime soon. And in the short run, Democrats need some of those rural and heartland working-class votes.\par \par \uc2 The takeaway from both answers? A smart formula for Democrats would be to lean left on economics but toward the center on culture. A good place to start might be by pushing back against politically correct thought-policing online and on campus. For, say, \uc2 Joe Biden\uc2  or \uc2 Pete Buttigieg\uc2 , a "Sister Souljah" moment or two could go a long way.\par \par \uc2 Jonathan Rauch is a senior fellow at the \uc2 Brookings Institution\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 On foreign policy, left and right are scrambled\par \par \uc2 By \uc2 Anne-Marie Slaughter\par \par \uc2 Democrats are actually moving both left and right on foreign policy. Democratic presidential candidates largely tilt left on both climate change and pulling back from foreign wars and global leadership (with the exception of \uc2 Joe Biden\uc2  and \uc2 Pete Buttigieg\uc2 ). On the other hand, they are almost all China hawks and mostly protectionist, at least relative to both \uc2 Bill Clinton\uc2  and \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 . That is ground that President Trump has staked out and held, so it's hard to describe it purely as "left."\par \par \uc2 The country is likely to follow. The majority of Americans agree that climate change is increasingly an existential threat, one that we are experiencing already. Fighting climate change is a domestic as well as global subject, but measures like a carbon tax with dividends returned to the public, which is attracting support on the right and the left, would require global agreement to avoid countries profiting from tax differentials.\par \par \uc2 The question of America's role in the world is framed as "should America be the global policeman" by people who would say no and as "should America continue to aspire to global leadership" by people who would say yes. Democrats have been questioning the value of leading through use of force and the deployment of troops since 2008, when the fault line of support for or opposition to the Iraq War helped Obama become the nominee over \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 . Even more important, the post-World War II vision of activist American leadership designed to rally our allies to help cool down hot spots and fight tyrants around the world is fading with the baby boomers who embraced it \u8212\'20\'14 on the right and the left.\par \par \uc2 Americans who think that our troops are overdeployed and our dollars are underappreciated abroad will be content with a foreign policy that seeks to lead more by the "power of our example" than the "example of our power," to borrow a line used by Democrats over the years. The majority will want to shore up our alliances and strengthen our diplomatic clout, but when it becomes apparent just how much that clout depends on the credible use of force, they are likely to balk. And for this Democrat, at least, some of the money we spend on making that threat credible is better spent on education, equity and energy \u8212\'20\'14 of the renewable kind.\par \par \uc2 Anne-Marie Slaughter\uc2  is CEO of New America.\par \par \uc2 Yes to moving left. No to ideological bubbles.\par \par \uc2 By Joshua DuBois\par \par \uc2 Democrats are right to find the injustices that remain in our country and work to root them out. If that focus is described as a "move to the left," then that move is a good and moral thing. More than 100 Americans die every day because of gun violence. Our climate is changing, and marginalized communities are threatened most by that change. Families are working well over 40 hours per week and still struggling to make ends meet. Individuals still face discrimination because of the color of their skin, whom they love or simply who they are. A country where we face fewer of these problems with each passing day is a country where I want to live.\par \par \uc2 However, we have to be careful to pipeline those priorities from people in communities themselves. This does not mean that we should slow the march toward progress. I believe strongly in what the \uc2 Rev. Martin Luther King Jr\uc2 . said in his "Letter From a Birmingham Jail": "Freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed. Frankly, I have never yet engaged in a direct action movement that was 'well timed.' " But leaders in our party, and influential voices in the broader progressive movement, must constantly assess not just the demands we are making but the source material for those demands. Are we rooting our causes in communities, or amplifying an existing echo chamber? Are we camouflaging self- or organizational interest as community interest?\par \par \uc2 The only way to check those motivations is to spend disproportionate time listening and learning stories from communities affected the most. Those stories \u8212\'20\'14 and the solutions that arise from them \u8212\'20\'14 are often more nuanced, careful, hopeful and ultimately righteous than the simple, uncompromising messages we tend to share in our own circles, online and offline.\par \par \uc2 Joshua DuBois was a White House adviser to President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  on faith, race and community partnerships. He now leads a consulting and marketing research firm and provides political commentary on CNN.\par \par \uc2 General-election voters will not be pleased\par \par \uc2 By Lanhee J. Chen\par \par \uc2 Americans won't follow the Democrats to the left because the policy solutions that come with that move are ultimately unappealing. While the proposals being touted by leading progressive Democrats may sound good at first, further analysis almost always exposes their flaws.\par \par \uc2 A prime example of this is the way in which Elizabeth Warren and \uc2 Bernie Sanders\uc2  have been widely criticized \u8212\'20\'14 by Democrats and Republicans alike \u8212\'20\'14 for the Medicare-for-all plans that they support. The plans will displace current private insurance arrangements for hundreds of millions of Americans and are so expensive that neither Sanders nor Warren can honestly explain how they'll be paid for. Quite simply, Americans aren't ready to follow Democrats to the left if it means wrecking the health-care system we have now.\par \par \uc2 And there are other policy examples, too. Take Democrats' movement toward decriminalizing border crossings and their criticism of physical barriers at America's southern border. Or their support of wealth taxes that have rarely worked in any other country where they've been tried and often lead not to more tax revenue but more tax evasion. Or progressives' advocacy for policies to fight climate change that could raise the price of energy for many households, cost up to tens of trillions of dollars, and result in dramatic changes to the ways we live and work.\par \par \uc2 While these policies are appealing to the progressive Democrats who will largely populate the primaries and caucuses, they will be a challenge for Democrats once a broader electorate examines them more closely. It's hard to imagine that Americans will follow Democrats to the left if it means supporting the far-left ideas we've heard espoused by many presidential candidates this year. That's why we can expect the Democratic nominee for president \u8212\'20\'14 whoever she or he is \u8212\'20\'14 to pivot to a more palatable middle ground once the general-election campaign begins in earnest.\par \par \uc2 Lanhee J. Chen is the David and Diane Steffy Fellow in American Public Policy Studies at the \uc2 Hoover Institution\uc2  and director of domestic policy studies in the public policy program at \uc2 Stanford University\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Latinx voters are leading the shift to the left\par \par \uc2 By Natalia Salgado\par \par \uc2 For black and brown communities across our country, the question of whether America will follow the leftward surge is a question of life or death. \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  is denying immigrants, specifically Latinx immigrants, a life in this country, or a life at all. The shootings in Ohio and El Paso are proof that the Trump presidency has put Latinx lives at risk by emboldening those who think that this country should work just for white people.\par \par \uc2 We \u8212\'20\'14 as Latinx voters and, more broadly, voters of color \u8212\'20\'14 are leading the move to the left. We are demanding that the Democratic Party follow. This is a huge shift for a party that has historically ignored us except for last-ditch efforts leading up to an election. Through grass-roots organizations and networks like the Center for Popular Democracy Action, Mijente, Texas Organizing Project, CASA, Make the Road and others, we are pushing the Democratic Party to take our votes seriously and propose policies that create a future for all of us in this country. The movement of the Democratic Party to the left is a necessary step, but a reactive one.\par \par \uc2 Voters of color, including Latinx voters, are an increasing percentage of the American electorate \u8212\'20\'14 and our share will only grow bigger. There are 32 million Latinx voters who will be eligible to vote in the 2020 election. For us to turn out, we need a candidate who will commit to undoing the damage that Trump has caused us and to proactively promoting a vision for this country that includes us and allows us to thrive.\par \par \uc2 If a leftward move of the Democratic Party means a move to represent our voices, our perspectives and our interests, then that is the direction we should be headed.\par \par \uc2 Natalia Salgado is the national political director of the Center for Popular Democracy Action, a liberal organizing group based in New York.\par \par \uc2 The left-right spectrum has lost all meaning\par \par \uc2 By Katherine Mangu-Ward\par \par \uc2 The left-right spectrum is worse than useless for understanding the American ideological landscape. We live in a world where Fox News pundit and unofficial presidential adviser \uc2 Tucker Carlson\uc2  has kind words to say about Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren's extremely progressive economic policy proposals, but only because he thinks they will help restore traditional family structure and bring back blue-collar manufacturing jobs.\par \par \uc2 The snake isn't just eating its own tail, it appears to be vomiting it back up as well.\par \par \uc2 Since \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  became president and embarked on his convoluted trade war, Democrats have a newfound skepticism about tariffs. Republicans, meanwhile, are no longer troubled by deficit spending and even seem keen on some new entitlements, such as mandatory paid parental leave. Every major-party 2020 hopeful is campaigning on regulation of free speech online; Democrats want to bar hate speech on social media while Republicans are mad at massive corporations (!) for what they perceive as "censorship" of conservative opinions. Things are even more topsy-turvy in foreign policy, where a sitting Republican champions antiwar views (while oscillating wildly on implementation) and powerful Democrats take to the nation's op-ed pages to urge him to listen to the wise generals who favor the interventionist status quo.\par \par \uc2 All of which is to say: I'm not at all sure what it means to say the Democrats (or Americans) are moving left. But Americans seem increasingly comfortable with reactionary authoritarianism in its various guises. Both socialism and nationalism are experiencing resurgences in popularity after having spent decades in the doghouse for very good reasons. There is a bipartisan consensus emerging in favor of a larger, stronger and more-intrusive government. And that's a more telling \u8212\'20\'14 and worrying \u8212\'20\'14 trend than whatever the polls say about left or right.\par \par \uc2 Katherine Mangu-Ward is editor in chief of Reason magazine.\par \par \uc2 You can\u8217\'20\'19t defeat Trumpism without a broad coalition\par \par \uc2 By Neera Tanden\par \par \uc2 Under Trump's presidency, most Democrats \u8212\'20\'14 and much of the country \u8212\'20\'14 feel that America faces an existential threat to progressive values and to our democracy as a whole. That is why electability has become such a central issue in the Democratic primaries. But this debate is not just about the best candidate to beat Trump. It is also about the best kind of campaign and agenda to defeat him.\par \par \uc2 Part of the debate concerns ideology: whether the best strategy for winning is a left agenda that could energize the base, or a broader and more practical agenda that could attract swing voters. However, this is a false choice.\par \par \uc2 Only mobilizing the Democratic base may not be enough in 2020, since we know Trump will likely motivate his own core supporters. In fact, Trump's recent campaigning in the Louisiana governor's race turned out an additional 200,000 voters compared with the last election in 2015 \u8212\'20\'14 many of them white and rural \u8212\'20\'14 helping to force a runoff for the Democratic incumbent.\par \par \uc2 In 2020, Democrats can \u8212\'20\'14 and should \u8212\'20\'14 turn out their base, while simultaneously making their case to swing voters. That's precisely what happened in 2018. Participation rates among millennials and people of color soared, with the number of Latino voters nearly doubling from the previous midterm elections in 2014. But persuadable Trump voters played the more important role: According to Catalist, a progressive firm that tracks voter data, "Democratic gains were \u8230\'20\'26 largely driven by voters who voted for Trump in 2016 and voted Democratic in 2018."\par \par \uc2 We can have a bold agenda that also appeals to a wide spectrum of voters. For example, the \uc2 Center for American Progress\uc2  has released a proposal that would achieve universal health care by creating a national health plan similar to Medicare that's open to everyone, while allowing those who receive private insurance through their employers to keep their current plans. This approach receives broad support across the political landscape, including from a majority of Democrats in Iowa. What's more, it would not raise taxes on the middle class \u8212\'20\'14 making it less vulnerable to attacks from Trump while still providing coverage for all.\par \par \uc2 To end Trumpism, not just beat Trump, will take a major electoral defeat. That is possible, but it means building a broad coalition with a broad agenda.\par \par \uc2 Neera Tanden is president of the Center for American Progress Action Fund.\par \par \uc2 A centrist\u8217\'20\'19s case for a leftward tilt\par \par \uc2 By Elaine C. Kamarck\par \par \uc2 America is already there. Which is why, as an avowed centrist, I have no problem with my party's leftward tilt, especially on economic issues.\par \par \uc2 In recent decades the country has undergone what is often called the "financialization" of the economy: People who make money playing with money have become richer and more important than people who make things that we like and use such as iPhones and washing machines. Think of it as Wall Street takes out Main Street. This doctrine encompassed a set of behaviors that emphasized short-term returns to investors over long-term growth. The economist William Lazonick of the University of Massachusetts at Lowell has summed up these changes as a shift from "retain-and-reinvest to downsize-and-distribute." The results have cost Americans good jobs and hollowed out the middle class while increasing returns to an obscenely rich 1 percent.\par \par \uc2 This "vulture capitalism" plays out in several ways. One is through the work of so-called activist investors. Indeed, an activist-investor drama is taking place as I write. \uc2 Elliott Management Corp\uc2 ., a large hedge fund, has been buying stock in \uc2 AT&T\uc2 . Elliott has recently put \uc2 AT&T\uc2  on notice that it could be more profitable (i.e., have a higher short-term stock price) if it divested landline businesses and closed retail stores. The \uc2 Communications Workers of America\uc2 , a labor union, estimates that these suggestions could negatively affect 30,000 workers.\par \par \uc2 Average Americans have seen this happen hundreds of times in their own towns. It was one of the biggest reasons that, in 2012, \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2  lost the presidential election. I am neutral in the Democratic presidential race, but it is clear that anger at a capitalism that guts corporations and kills jobs to enrich the 1 percent is fueling the campaign of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, one of the first people to blow the whistle on it. When it comes to correcting the abuses of vulture capitalism, the Democratic Party's leftward tilt is a very real response to what has happened to Americans and their jobs.\par \par \uc2 Elaine C.

And yet, this gesture \u8212\'20\'14 like other similar ones by her campaign \u8212\'20\'14 was a necessary symbolic act of fealty to a specific mode of politics. Warren was deferring to the activist cadres that run and staff the organs of the institutional left. This faction is situated at critical choke points of the nonprofit and governmental civil rights apparatus, which derives its power and authority from the manufacture of new protected classes on whose behalf the latest moral crusade requiring federal intervention can be launched. These factions in turn are axially allied with a novelty-seeking media that has a role in reporting what happened, but an even larger role, as the writer Ben Sixsmith has put it, in "memeing trends into existence."\par \par \uc2 The California state legislature recently tabled a model ethnic studies curriculum for public high school students, which the same body has repeatedly tried to make a graduation requirement. The curriculum calls on students to "critique empire and its relationship to white supremacy, racism, patriarchy, cisheteropatriarchy, capitalism, ableism, anthropocentrism and other forms of power and oppression," in order to "connect ourselves to past and contemporary resistance movements that struggle for social justice." This is the language around which this new administrative class has coalesced.\par \par \uc2 When the \uc2 Working Families Party\uc2  made the surprising choice to endorse Warren over \uc2 Bernie Sanders\uc2 , it was likely motivated by the concerns and interests of these cadres, who are pursuing the "intersectional" practice of stitching together a tapestry of identity groups in shared pursuit of the power vested in the federal government to regulate. Sanders is an old white man fixed in a mid-20th-century class politics that this coalition regards as essentially anachronistic, not just because of who he is but because, as an outsider to the institutional Democratic Party, he is a stranger to the administrative classes for whom the language of "ableism" and "cisheteropatriarchy" is the coin of the realm.\par \par \uc2 This intersectional approach is excellent at acquiring power through intramural struggle within institutions. It has been less successful in winning national elections. Whether the country follows the Democratic Party on its left turn largely depends on whether Warren or whoever the party picks as its standard-bearer can preserve some room to maneuver apart from the implacable demands of this faction. At the moment, I'm not optimistic.\par \par \uc2 Wesley Yang is a columnist for Tablet and the author of "The Souls of Yellow Folk."\par \par \uc2 Democrats are finally catching up on racial justice\par \par \uc2 By Peniel Joseph\par \par \uc2 Since at least Lyndon Johnson's Great Society, the Democratic Party, to both the benefit and the ill of its electoral prospects, has been identified as the party of social justice and racial equality. Losing five of six presidential contests between 1968 and 1988 prompted a rightward shift exemplified by \uc2 Bill Clinton\uc2 's politically deft yet morally reprehensible triangulation on the question of black America. Easily the most striking aspect of today's Democratic primary race has been the distance traveled, especially by some contenders, from the days when Clinton triumphantly passed criminal justice and welfare reform that penalized the black poor. The candid discussion of reparations for descendants of enslaved African Americans shows how far we've come since Democrats believed that racial scapegoating was necessary for electoral success.\par \par \uc2 The Obama coalition built its political strength on demographic transformations combined with the implicit belief that the election of a black president could both represent racial progress and contribute to the eradication of institutional racism. \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 's electoral coalition, based on explicit and ugly appeals to white nationalism, upended the racial optimism of 2008-2009 and liberated Democrats from speaking politely about racial equality while largely ignoring the promotion of racial justice as a policy agenda. The rise of Kamala Harris, \uc2 Ayanna Pressley\uc2  and \uc2 Stacey Abrams\uc2  has highlighted the fact that black women represent the party's "stickiest" voter, a loyal constituency that Democrats now need more than ever to reclaim the White House. On race matters, Democratic support of reparations, ending mass incarceration, universal health care and a living wage for all Americans recognizes right as well as reality.\par \par \uc2 Ultimately, for Democrats to regain the White House they must offer a political vision that recognizes the centrality of race to our national politics, but in a manner that pushes us closer to, rather than farther from, the "beloved community" that the \uc2 Rev. Martin Luther King Jr\uc2 . often evoked. For King that community required elected officials and ordinary citizens to wrestle with the legacy of slavery, the impact of Jim Crow and the prevalence of inequality throughout society. Contemporary Democrats bold enough to discuss the structural nature of racial inequality and the way race continues to shape positive and negative social, economic and political outcomes recognize that to achieve our country's highest aspirations requires plumbing the depths of its lowest historical moments. That means that Democrats are on the right path to not only electoral success but also a long overdue reckoning about the relationship between race and democracy. Will America follow? If Americans of all races and backgrounds who proudly joined the Obama coalition are given free and unfettered access to the polls next year, the answer promises to be a resounding yes.\par \par \uc2 Peniel Joseph is a professor of history and public affairs at the University of Texas at Austin, where he directs the Center for the Study of Race and Democracy.\par \par \uc2 Actually, Democrats are moving to the center\par \par \uc2 By Howard Dean\par \par \uc2 Much has been made of the supposed movement of the Democratic Party to the left. But the evidence suggests that the Democratic Party as a whole is more centrist than it was four years ago, while the electorate is moving from center-right to center-left.\par \par \uc2 First, while the four dynamic and outspoken women who make up "The Squad" were winning seats in Congress in 2018, Americans were also electing more than 30 other new representatives from Orange County, Calif., as well as Texas, Kansas, Oklahoma and Virginia, replacing very conservative members like Dave Brat, Dana Rohrabacher and Pete Sessions. These members, like \uc2 Conor Lamb\uc2 , who won two congressional elections in rural Pennsylvania last year, are centrist Democrats. Many of them are veterans.\par \par \uc2 Second, it is fair to say that the debate among presidential contenders skews left given the strong showings by Elizabeth Warren and \uc2 Bernie Sanders\uc2 . But \uc2 Joe Biden\uc2 , Amy Klobuchar and \uc2 Pete Buttigieg\uc2  have staked out more-moderate positions, and the latter two are climbing. Kamala Harris also appears to be portraying herself as a practical progressive.\par \par \uc2 Finally, the Democrats' rise is entirely because our party base is increasingly young, female and of color. But the younger generation, which elected \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 , is in many ways more moderate than mine. Gay rights, diversity, climate change and women's reproductive freedom are critical issues for them, but they also don't trust big institutions \u8212\'20\'14 including political parties, government, religious authoritarians, big corporations and labor unions.\par \par \uc2 The most interesting phenomenon to me, however, is that roughly 70 percent of under-35s, independent of ethnicity and gender, vote for Democrats, not because they love the party but because our values and their values are mostly a good fit. Republican values are too authoritarian, too spendthrift and too oriented toward corporate donors to appeal to this generation anytime soon. This new generation is fiscally moderate and socially very progressive with a streak of libertarianism, and they are now the largest voting bloc in the electorate. Even as they are dragging the Democrats toward the center, they are also dragging the politics of the country as a whole leftward because they are so overwhelmingly socially conscious compared with the more authoritarian and much older generation of Republican voters.\par \par \uc2 Howard Dean served as governor of Vermont from 1991 to 2003 and as chair of the Democratic National Committee from 2005 to 2009.

My experiences as a former undercover CIA officer and member of Congress have convinced me that to solve these challenges we must understand that way more unites us than divides us as a country. The most successful politicians of the future will have to defy the political truism that, as summarized by author Tim Alberta, "elections in modern America are won principally by mobilizing the base, not persuading the middle."\par \par \uc2 As you are reading this, China is working to replace the United States as the most important economy in the world, and our adversaries are challenging us around the globe. If they are successful, the quality of life of every American will decline. To meet this challenge, we should strengthen alliances, not weaken them, and be prepared to fight the wars of the future, not the wars of the past. America is successful only when our enemies fear us and our friends trust us.\par \par \uc2 According to a \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2  survey, 39 percent of Americans would struggle to cover an unexpected $400 expense. To ease these burdens we should empower people, not the government; however, many Democrats have proposed policies like taking away private health insurance from millions of people or ending the energy revolution we are currently benefiting from. These policies will negatively affect all Americans by weakening our economy and national security. For every family to have a chance at the American Dream, we must promote prosperity through free markets, not socialism.\par \par \uc2 Representing one of the most swing districts in the country, I know that reasonable Democrats and independents share these concerns and agree on the solutions.

Friedberg\par \par \uc2 Democrats may be running hard to the left on domestic policy, but on foreign policy at least the more "progressive" among them appear to be headed in the same direction as President Trump: toward a greatly diminished U.S. world role.\par \par \uc2 Like their arch-nemesis, progressive Democrats want to end the nation's "endless" wars and to avoid future military interventions, especially in the Middle East. Like Trump, they are skeptical of the benefits of free trade and believe that the international economic system has been "rigged" to benefit "globalist" elites. And, like Trump, they want to focus on "making America great again" or, as they might prefer, on "nation-building at home."\par \par \uc2 There are differences, of course. Trump is scornful of international institutions, denigrates America's traditional allies and defines the nation's interests in narrowly material terms. Progressives, by contrast, speak the lofty language of human rights and universal values, and hope to find cooperative, multilateral solutions to every global problem. Trump's desire to put "America first" risks leaving it isolated. The progressives' inclination to turn inward, cut defense spending and unfurl massive social welfare programs risks allowing external challenges to grow unchecked.\par \par \uc2 There are less-extreme voices to be heard on both sides of the political aisle, including from a few of the Democratic candidates and some congressional Republicans, as well as many former Democratic officials and their currently exiled "Never Trump" Republican counterparts. Dismissed by their parties' populists as out-of-touch and irrelevant, the views of these centrists may actually be closer to those of most Americans. A recent report by the \uc2 Chicago Council on Global Affairs\uc2  shows that significant majorities \u8212\'20\'14 despite favoring a measure of restraint \u8212\'20\'14 still express support for preserving military superiority, maintaining alliances, pursuing trade and promoting democracy. In other words, although the necessary leadership may be lacking at the moment among both Republicans and Democrats, public support for an active, engaged U.S. foreign policy remains strong.\par \par \uc2 Aaron L. Friedberg is a professor of politics and international affairs at Princeton University.\par \par \uc2 One of the two Americas is shifting left\par \par \uc2 By Tanzina Vega\par \par \uc2 It depends on which America you're talking about. Despite the Mueller report, the impeachment inquiry, multiple allegations of sexual misconduct and abuse, racial animus toward immigrants and asylum seekers, and deeply unpopular foreign policy initiatives, support for President Trump has remained around 40 percent. Expecting his base to shift is useless.\par \par \uc2 As a nation, however, we're becoming more racially diverse and less religious. We are also less able to get and sustain wealth. The yawning inequality gap in the United States has many Americans, young and old, disillusioned about the so-called American Dream. From digital media companies in cities like New York to factory floors in the Midwest, workers across the country are demanding better pay and protections from an increasingly automated economy. Americans are also scarred from the exorbitant costs of health care and prescription drugs, and from an opioid crisis that has devastated families and communities. All of these things have pushed younger Democrats further from the political center than their parents, and have invigorated marginalized groups to become more vocal in the fight for civil rights and economic justice.\par \par \uc2 The majority of Americans disapprove of the job this president is doing, and they want to see change. We already hear Democratic presidential candidates talking about concepts like the racial wealth gap, growing income inequality, criminal justice reform and LGBTQ rights in far more progressive terms than would have been thinkable during the last election cycle.\par \par \uc2 There is a fierce debate happening among Democratic voters about which candidate they'd prefer to have as a nominee. Younger voters of color seem captivated by Juli\u225\'00\'E1n Castro's progressive stances on many of these issues as opposed to \uc2 Joe Biden\uc2 's centrist and at times rambling approach to maintaining the status quo. Kamala Harris, a woman of color, has taken her share of criticism for her prosecutorial past, while \uc2 Bernie Sanders\uc2 , a white man in his 70s, nabbed an endorsement from progressive millennial icon Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. But in the end, I suspect Democrats will have no choice but to vote for whoever runs against Trump, regardless of how progressive (or not) they happen to be.\par \par \uc2 Tanzina Vega is host of the nationally syndicated public radio show "The Takeaway" from WNYC and PRX.\par \par \uc2 Voters want an end to our rigged economic system\par \par \uc2 By \uc2 Sheila Bair\par \par \uc2 The tango requires close synchronization between two partners. For decades, the government and moneyed interests have been performing a political version of it, gliding across a ballroom strewn with special breaks, boondoggles and bailouts. The failure of the Democratic ticket to acknowledge this unseemly pas de deux led to its defeat in 2016. This time around, most of the Democratic presidential candidates have felt the public's not-so-gentle tap on their shoulders and have vowed that their administration will partner with the public electorate who brought them to the ball. Yet, to do so, they promise a bigger and more powerful government \u8212\'20\'14 the same government that has been so willing to let profiteers fill its dance card in the past.\par \par \uc2 Democrats have been as willing as Republicans to tango with the rent-reaping lounge lizards. Time and again, well-intended government programs aimed at expanded public access to health care, education or homeownership are co-opted by profit-seeking concerns. Tax breaks meant to spur economic growth instead exacerbate yawning economic inequality while inflating bubbles, as tax-advantaged dollars chase too few opportunities for real economic growth. Government regulators become captive of the regulated. Whether it's plane crashes or financial crashes, the public is put at risk.\par \par \uc2 The general electorate wants to break up the dance party. This includes many business leaders who are also fed up with government waste and favoritism. But they will be skeptical of more government as the solution. \uc2 Andrew Yang\uc2 's idea for giving financial support directly to families \u8212\'20\'14 cutting out the government and industry middlemen \u8212\'20\'14 may have particular appeal. Ultimately, the person will be more important than the policy, giving the edge to a candidate such as Elizabeth Warren, who has made restoring independence, integrity and trust in government a centerpiece of her campaign. That is the kind of leadership Americans need to bounce the cronies off the dance floor.\par \par \uc2 Sheila Bair\uc2  is director of the Volcker Alliance, a nonpartisan group that aims to improve the efficiency of government.

But nothing suggests that the Democratic candidates are especially "left" on immigration. In fact, they are very mainstream. Rather than wondering if America will follow, it's more accurate to say that the Democrats are following America.\par \par \uc2 What do Democratic candidates and many Americans find deeply troubling? Not just separating children from parents, but sidestepping the rules in U.S. immigration law requiring full asylum hearings before immigration judges. Not just keeping spouses from living together in the United States, but doing so with a "travel ban" targeting six Muslim countries. Not just ending the humane treatment of young undocumented immigrants under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy, but ignoring Congress's requirements that any administration articulate rational reasons for policy changes. Broad public revulsion with the administration's immigration policies has nothing to do with open borders. The Democrats are actually defending borders and U.S. sovereignty \u8212\'20\'14 by insisting on borders with justice.\par \par \uc2 Borders allow us to promote equality and dignity on the inside, as a way to build a stronger America. But if borders are to help create a just society, they must be ethical borders. This means that presidents must not weaponize immigration to stoke racial and religious prejudice or to divide Americans. Presidents must not use race, ethnicity or religion to treat some Americans better than others. It cannot matter if you are from Nigeria or Norway, Syria or Slovenia. Enforcement cannot be especially harsh against migrants from Latin America. Presidents must not ride roughshod over the immigration framework that Congress has enacted into statutes. Presidents must not ignore the basic principles of fairness that make sure enforcement is consistent with the rule of law.\par \par \uc2 But this administration is guilty of all these fundamental violations, undermining why we have borders in the first place. When Democratic candidates object, they aren't supporting open borders. If Democrats make it clearer that they want borders with justice, they will be on the same page as the vast majority of Americans.\par \par \uc2 Hiroshi Motomura is a professor at the UCLA School of Law specializing in immigration and citizenship.\par \par \uc2 Democrats must refuse to be (falsely) called radicals\par \par \uc2 By \uc2 Mois\u233\'00\'E9s Na\u237\'00\'EDm\par \par \uc2 Americans will not follow politicians who fit the caricature that \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  and Fox News use to depict opponents of the incumbent president.\par \par \uc2 America-hating, \uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2 -loving, soft-on-crime radical socialists will not do well with voters. Fortunately, these radical socialists are scarce and not very influential. Unfortunately, they are omnipresent in Trump's speeches and tweets.\par \par \uc2 Politicians with credible proposals to solve the concrete problems that besiege Americans will do well with voters who are unwilling to take the president's claims at face value. That is why persuading voters to double-check the president's accusations and denounce his exaggerations and falsehoods will be important goals of his adversaries. But that will not be enough. The attacks of the president and his supporters need to be answered with a pragmatic stance and concrete solutions. For example, Democrats should keep reminding voters that a more affordable health care that is available to more Americans is not a left- or right-wing issue. It is what any citizen of one of the richest countries in the world has the right to expect.\par \par \uc2 Contrary to the \uc2 National Rifle Association\uc2 's rhetoric, banning assault rifles designed to massacre a large number of people in a short period of time or requiring background checks for gun buyers are not measures promoted by the left to undermine America. These are treated as common-sense ideas anywhere else in the world \u8212\'20\'14 and, increasingly, by American voters as well.\par \par \uc2 Suspending U.S. foreign aid to the Central American countries where hellish living conditions prompt hundreds of thousands of people to seek refuge in the United States is not a smart, hawkish right-wing, anti-\uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2  policy. It is, instead, a self-inflicted wound that weakens America because it boosts the pressures Central Americans have to leave their homes and flee north.\par \par \uc2 Defending the human rights of oppressed people everywhere is not a right or left issue either. It is one of the goals that the foreign policy of the world's most powerful democracy should never abandon even if, at times, it may conflict with other national interests.\par \par \uc2 Americans are pragmatists, not ideologues. Voters will follow candidates who speak to their concrete needs and aspirations. The challenge for Democrats is to show that Trump's policies, while at times seductive, are in fact poisonous and often hurt the great majority of Americans. And to show that the policies he routinely denounces as radical are no such thing.\par \par \uc2 Mois\u233\'00\'E9s Na\u237\'00\'EDm\uc2  is a distinguished fellow at the \uc2 Carnegie Endowment for International Peace\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 LGBT equality isn\u8217\'20\'19t a left-right issue anymore\par \par \uc2 By Sharon McGowan\par \par \uc2 As significant as our legal victories have been since the Stonewall riots 50 years ago, perhaps more important has been the increase in social acceptance for LGBT people and our families. While there are certainly far too many places where anti-LGBT discrimination is rampant, it is no longer possible to describe support for LGBT civil rights as some kind of radical "lefty" position. We know this because a majority of people support marriage equality in 44 of the 50 states; 71 percent support transgender people serving in the military; over two-thirds support laws that "would protect gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender people against discrimination in jobs, public accommodations, and housing"; and six in 10 Americans are also opposed to businesses refusing to provide products and services to gay and lesbian people for religious reasons. In other words, far from causing "social upheaval," the vindication of LGBT civil rights sits comfortably within the political mainstream.\par \par \uc2 Unfortunately, however, we continue to see anti-LGBT forces fighting this wave of public acceptance with every tool in their arsenal. For example, as cities in red states across the country increasingly try to expand protections against discrimination, deeply conservative \u8212\'20\'14 and often highly gerrymandered \u8212\'20\'14 state legislatures shut down these efforts by claiming that such local ordinances are preempted by state law.\par \par \uc2 Perhaps the most troubling trend is the packing of our federal judiciary with anti-LGBT ideologues. Notwithstanding far-reaching acceptance for our civil rights, this administration has succeeded in confirming judges at a record pace. Because these are lifetime appointments, we are now facing a generation or more of a federal judiciary that will be taking aim at our civil rights, and not surprisingly, our opponents are more emboldened than ever. Therefore, we cannot become complacent, and must recommit ourselves to the fight for full equality.\par \par \uc2 But make no mistake about it: This is no longer an issue of left vs. right. We know it, and the rest of the country does, too.\par \par \uc2 Sharon McGowan is chief strategy officer and legal director at Lambda Legal, the nation's oldest civil rights organization for LGBT rights and people with HIV.\par \par \uc2 Voters are ready for bold action\par \par \uc2 By Richard Cordray\par \par \uc2 The American people are demanding progress toward real answers for the major problems we face. They want bold action. Most of us want a lasting solution to the constant threat that health-care costs pose to our families. The Trump administration utterly failed to "repeal and replace" Obamacare yet is still trying to dismantle the gains made to broaden coverage, control costs and protect those with preexisting conditions. On climate change, most people accept the overwhelming evidence and recognize the growing frequency of extreme weather events. They want meaningful action on renewable energy and new leadership to rebuild our global alliances to address this existential threat to our planet. Families want their children to be able to get the education and training they need to compete in our fast-moving economy without drowning in debt. And people are chafing at the dramatic and increasing income inequality that is driving down prospects for the middle class.\par \par \uc2 Despite inheriting a strong economy, the Trump administration has pushed the deficit to nearly a trillion dollars this year, with little to show for it except irresponsible tax cuts that benefit those who are already wealthy. On the major issues \u8212\'20\'14 health care, climate change, access to higher education and job training, income inequality and so much more \u8212\'20\'14 most Americans believe that we need to deliver big structural changes to move our country forward. They want practical reforms, but they will not be content with small half-measures. This same feeling gripped the country with the progressive movement, the New Deal and the Reagan Revolution. Americans seek real leadership on these issues, and the Democrats must offer a persuasive vision with the courage and determination to make it happen.\par \par \uc2 Richard Cordray was the 2018 Democratic gubernatorial candidate in Ohio.

In July 2017, former congressman \uc2 Joe Crowley\uc2  told the Associated Press that the party's message was still "being worked on." Almost a year later Crowley, the fourth most powerful Democrat in the House, was ousted by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a 28-year-old democratic socialist. After her primary victory, Ocasio-Cortez told MSNBC, "We have to stick to the message: What are we proposing to the American people? Not, 'What are we fighting against?' " Within a year, the once-fringe ideas she championed \u8212\'20\'14 like the Green New Deal \u8212\'20\'14 have forced Democratic presidential candidates to move left.\par \par \uc2 Of course, many party leaders still are not on board with this shift, and recent polls indicate that almost half of Americans find the party too radical. Yet if Democratic leaders run back to the center, as they have in the past, they will risk repeating the mistakes of \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  and handing another victory to Trump. Rather than chase the elusive swing Republican voter, Democratic leadership should lean harder into a movement that is so clearly animating its base.\par \par \uc2 Republicans have normalized right-wing extremism, both in rhetoric and policy. If America is to follow Democrats to the left (or even back to the center), Democrats must unify behind a strong, bold vision; they must reframe public debates around abortion, democratic socialism, immigration and climate change; and they must find a way to translate their values into terms that resonate with working-class people, people of color and young people \u8212\'20\'14 even in deeply red pockets. Gen Z is the most ethnically and racially diverse generation in U.S. history.

Will America follow?" is no, because America is already there. Poll after poll shows that the large majority of progressive policies are already deeply popular.\par \par \uc2 Take the minimum wage. Pollsters have always found broad support for minimum-wage increases. Polls conducted earlier this year show a majority of Americans support increasing the minimum wage to $15, which is where the vast majority of Democratic presidential candidates stand on the issue.\par \par \uc2 What about unions? Many Democratic candidates have very progressive labor platforms \u8212\'20\'14 which is exactly what workers want, since although less than 12 percent of workers are in a union, the share jumps to over 50 percent if you include nonunion workers who report they want to be in a union.\par \par \uc2 Polling shows that most Republicans and Democrats support maintaining or increasing spending on Social Security, and that most Americans support higher taxes on the wealthy and corporations, paid family and medical leave, and on and on. In proposing these things, the Democrats are simply catching up to what America wants.\par \par \uc2 This doesn't mean the work of progressive leaders is completely done. For example, while a large majority of Americans say they support Medicare "for all who want it," support drops to less than 50 percent when respondents are asked whether they support Medicare-for-all that eliminates private insurance. In other words, on some things, more work will be needed to pull people along, and Democrats need a plan to convince the skeptical. But these are the exceptions, not the rule. On most progressive policies, Democrats' move to the left has simply moved them closer to where America was all along.\par \par \uc2 Heidi Shierholz is a senior economist and director of policy at the Economic Policy Institute.

With rampant racism and historic inequality, this is a time for strong leadership.\par \par \uc2 The last few election cycles in Florida prove we can energize a broad coalition of young people, black and brown communities, women and more around dynamic leaders with transformative policies. In 2016, Democrats lost Florida after nominating a candidate who did not motivate our base. Many of our voters stayed home, while the other side used fear and division to galvanize its base. In comparison, 2018 saw the biggest upset in Florida in the past 20 years when a bold, progressive black candidate won the Democratic nomination for governor, even after being heavily outspent by a large number of well-known middle-of-the-road candidates. Floridians heard \uc2 Andrew Gillum\uc2  and saw themselves represented in his story, his values and his vision for a state where we all belong. While he narrowly lost the governor's mansion by less than half a percentage point, he garnered more votes than any Democratic contender in the past 20 years. He engaged and inspired young voters and voters of color, who don't vote at the same rates as their white counterparts.\par \par \uc2 In Florida, we are coming together to build a new majority of voters that is demanding real leadership, not politicians who don't come from our communities and are too afraid to talk about what is really affecting our lives. Will Democrats follow?\par \par \uc2 Andrea Mercado is executive director of the New Florida Majority.\par \par \uc2 Democrats are in danger of going too far\par \par \uc2 By Ruy Teixeira\par \par \uc2 Is the country moving to the left? Absolutely. Are the Democrats moving to the left? Absolutely. Could the Democrats move too far to the left? Absolutely.\par \par \uc2 Consider the evidence. According to political scientist James Stimson's public policy mood index \u8212\'20\'14 which measures sentiment across a wide range of policies \u8212\'20\'14 Americans' support for government action is now at its highest level since the 1960s. Thus the idea that the country is moving to the left is not wishful thinking on the part of liberal pundits and politicians.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, it can scarcely be disputed that the Democrats are moving to the left. Simply look at the range of measures under discussion in the primary debates. Even the leading "moderate" candidate, \uc2 Joe Biden\uc2 , is pushing policies substantially to the left of what \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  ran on in 2016, including a public health insurance plan open to all Americans.\par \par \uc2 But it also cannot be disputed that Democrats could run too far to the left for even a country that is moving leftward. Take some of the policies that have been under discussion in the Democratic debates and pushed by Democratic activists:\par \par \uc2 1. Reparations for the descendants of slaves. This is massively unpopular. It would be more consistent with a country moving leftward to advocate needed social programs that happen to disproportionately benefit black Americans because of their income, education or location.\par \par \uc2 2. Decriminalizing the border or abolishing ICE. Neither of these measures is remotely consistent with the views of the public. It would make more sense for Democrats to advocate for reforming the enforcement agency plus a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants plus a humane immigration policy that still includes border security.\par \par \uc2 3. Medicare-for-all that eliminates private insurance. The polling could not be clearer: What the public really wants is Medicare-for-anyone or Medicare-for-all-who-want-it. This is embodied in the DeLauro-Schakowsky Medicare for America bill, as well as in the positions of some of the more moderate Democratic candidates.\par \par \uc2 4. A Green New Deal that commits to 100 percent renewable energy within 10 years. The public is not on board with anything quite so ambitious, but there is significant support for a Green New Deal that would focus on jobs, infrastructure and research.\par \par \uc2 In my view, these are the "four don'ts" of the 2020 campaign.

\par\par \uc2 Magazine\par {\*\bkmkstart toc7}{\*\bkmkend toc7}\b \uc2 The Democrats are moving left. Will America follow?\b0\par\par\uc2 Richard Just \par \uc2 12,090 \uc2 words\par \uc2 17 November 2019\par \uc2 The Washington Post\par \uc2 WP\par \uc2 FINAL\par A35\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2019, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved \par \par \uc2 Perhaps the great unknown of 2020 is how the tenor of the Democratic nomination contest will affect the general election. The outcome of the primaries and caucuses, of course, is far from clear - the nominee may ultimately lean to the center or the left - but what is clear is that the party has shifted in fundamental ways since the last presidential election. You can see it in the policy positions being discussed and embraced by Democrats, many of which go well beyond the positions taken by previous Democratic presidents and nominees - from banning private insurance to free college to a wealth tax to the Green New Deal. You can see it in the left-populist worldviews and solid poll numbers of two of the three leading candidates, Sens. Elizabeth Warren and \uc2 Bernie Sanders\uc2 . And you can see it in the substantial popularity among the Democratic rank-and-file of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and her allies in Congress.\par \par \uc2  In this issue of the magazine, journalists, wonks, activists and politicians - from a variety of ideological perspectives - reflect on how all of this might play out in the months and years to come, and how Americans should feel about it. - Richard Just\par \par \uc2 It's about time Democrats moved left\par \par \uc2 By Brittney Cooper\par \par \uc2 Since 2011, we have watched a spate of social movements - the Arab Spring, SlutWalk, Occupy Wall Street, Black Lives Matter, the Women's March and #MeToo - remind Americans of how essential protest is to shoring up the integrity of democratic politics. If you understand the history this way, Democrats have taken a decade to arrive at what has by all accounts been a pretty raucous party, what with flesh-baring feminists demanding sexual autonomy, young black folks fighting the power again, and radical white kids mad as hell about capitalism robbing them of their American Dreams. To the Democrats' credit, they have made a fashionably late entrance, bringing the power of formal and established American politics to a table set by those who usually, to paraphrase \uc2 Shirley Chisholm\uc2 , have to bring their own chair.\par \par \uc2 When we ask the question of whether Americans will follow, it begets for me a different question: Which Americans do you mean? Young Americans of all races, and especially those of color, have been sounding the death knell of capitalist excess since they formed the first encampments in New York's Zuccotti Park. When we see presidential candidates laying out policies and affirming their belief in reproductive justice, reparations and Medicare-for-all, this leftward shift is the direct result of the leadership of 21st-century rabble-rousers and dissenters. The question of whether Americans will follow really asks whether older generations, baby boomers in particular, will get on board with a vision that fundamentally challenges their belief in the myth of American meritocracy - that if you work hard, you can have everything you want. The country simply does not work that way for undocumented folks, for black folks, for the poor, or for trans people.\par \par \uc2 Do I believe Americans will follow? Americans like me - first-generation college kids, 40-year-old xennials squeezed by the care-taking of children and elders, and those mortified by the persistence of patriarchy, our brazen return to violent white nationalism and our swift if predictable descent into fascism - absolutely will. It's the only way to a future in which we all get to live and thrive.\par \par \uc2 Brittney Cooper is an associate professor of women's and gender studies and Africana studies at \uc2 Rutgers University\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The left isn't making it easy to vote Democratic\par \par \uc2 By \uc2 Linda Chavez\par \par \uc2 For conservatives like me who are alarmed at President Trump's unprecedented assaults on the Constitution, the unthinkable has become a near imperative. For the first time since 1968, when I voted for Vice President Hubert Humphrey, I may cast a vote for a Democrat for president. In the last election, I wrote in my own Republican preference - \uc2 Marco Rubio\uc2  - but this time, the stakes are simply too high to throw away my vote. The Democrats aren't making my choice easier.\par \par \uc2 The Democratic Party's lurch to the left will undermine what should be a chance to win against a deeply unpopular president. Trump has exploded the national debt and is running deficits unheard of outside major wars. But Democrats' plans for trillions of dollars in spending on everything from climate change to free college to expanded Medicare-for-all with no way to pay for it is a turnoff for voters who wouldn't think of buying a bigger house or a new car if they couldn't afford it. Yet perhaps the biggest problem for Democrats is cultural: They are tone deaf when it comes to the values that matter to many religious and socially conservative voters, including significant numbers of Latinos and blacks.\par \par \uc2 Sen. Elizabeth Warren's snarky reply at a recent debate about what she would tell a faith voter who believes marriage should be between one man and one woman was a case in point: "I'm going to assume it's a guy who said that. And I'm going to say, 'Then just marry one woman,' '' she said, capping off with, "assuming you can find one." \uc2 Beto O'Rourke\uc2  upped the ante, saying his administration would take tax-exempt status away from churches and organizations that did not recognize same-sex marriage. On abortion, even \uc2 Joe Biden\uc2 , who previously opposed government funding of abortions, has changed his stance in the face of the Democratic Party's uncompromising opposition to any restrictions on the procedure. These positions may be popular in Democratic primaries, but come November 2020, they could help ensure \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 's reelection.\par \par \uc2 Linda Chavez\uc2  is a senior fellow at the Niskanen Center.\par \par \uc2 Rural Americans will welcome this shift\par \par \uc2 By Elizabeth Catte\par \par \uc2 On an electoral map, I live in Staunton, Va., a dot of blue in a sea of red - a small city surrounded by a large rural county that should be, according to conventional political wisdom, filled with the kind of unexciting, middle-of-the-road voters that \uc2 Joe Biden\uc2  dreams of and the centrist wing of the Democratic Party mythologizes. Our local Democratic candidates, hampered by gerrymandering, lose gracefully to their Republican rivals. Our assistance to the Democrats in state and national elections is reliable but delivered in modest numbers. We are the kind of people the party likes to seek donations from but never listen to. We are folks who know our place.\par \par \uc2 Except in 2019, our local Democrats decided to write their own platform, to step up and articulate a vision amid what to them felt like an absence of coherent principles and values from the national party. As working issues, their platform included the abolition of \uc2 Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2 , divestment from fossil fuels, universal health care, total student loan forgiveness and the repeal of right-to-work laws. Their collective direction on more than 60 issues covered by the new platform puts our local organization squarely to the left of both the state and national party, as well as many of the current primary candidates. It was adopted by a unanimous vote.\par \par \uc2 Nationally, with an eye toward 2020, Sens. \uc2 Bernie Sanders\uc2  and Elizabeth Warren are the best hope for the left on the narrow electoral terms through which they might succeed. They will face a dangerous terrain where voter apathy will collide with voter suppression and modern misinformation campaigns from the right. Godspeed to them both. But ordinary Americans, not elected representatives or political parties, are at the forefront of progressive politics in the United States. If the Democrats are moving left, it is because they are following, not leading.\par \par \uc2 Elizabeth Catte is a public historian and author of "What You Are Getting Wrong About Appalachia."\par \par \uc2 The necessity and political savvy of the Green New Deal\par \par \uc2 By \uc2 Bill McKibben\par \par \uc2 On climate change, the party is not moving left - it's moving to where the populace is, especially those segments of it under the age of 40. The polling shows a spiking level of concern, which is about what one would expect in a nation ever more buffeted by the effects of rising temperatures. No one who watched a city literally called Paradise turn into hell last year has forgotten those images; the farmers who endured the wettest year in American history and couldn't get tractors into the field know better than most how fast the world is changing.\par \par \uc2 And they all know how little the government has done to face this crisis. In fact, some surveys show that President Trump and the Republicans are more out of touch with popular sentiment on the environment than on anything else.\par \par \uc2 That's why all the thinking that falls under the general rubric of the Green New Deal is so smart. It understands the climate crisis as a lens through which to view the world - a chance to address not only its rising temperature but the rising inequality that roils our politics. If your own life is insecure, it's harder to imagine change of the kind we need to deal with this moment. Ideas like a federal job guarantee for anyone who wants to help with the renewables transition are important precisely because they give people a chance to get their feet on the ground.\par \par \uc2 It all comes with political danger, of course. If the history of the past 30 years teaches us anything, it's that those in the fossil fuel industry will do all they can to defend their business model, and since they more or less own one of our political parties, expect endless diatribes about taking away your hamburgers. Up against the growing press of flood and fire, however, I think and hope they'll fail.\par \par \uc2 Bill McKibben\uc2  is an environmentalist and author of, most recently, "Falter: Has the Human Game Begun to Play Itself Out?"\par \par \uc2 For the lockdown generation, it's about lives - not left or right\par \par \uc2 By Emma Gonz\u224\'00\'E0\u161\'00\'A1lez\par \par \uc2 Young Americans have plenty of reasons to be scared, anxious and mad as hell. Adults and elected officials have done basically nothing to address the gun violence in our country, and the problems we face are only getting worse. Our country's addiction to guns has created a culture of violence that has taken the lives of far too many - nearly 40,000 in 2017, the most recent year for which complete data is available, and the highest annual total in 50 years. It has touched not only my community, but communities everywhere.\par \par \uc2 Many have called our generation the lockdown generation, but this problem has existed long before us. However, it is up to us to elect people who value life over politics. We aren't looking for someone on the left or on the right; we are looking for someone who will help us move forward. Our generation has lost its childhood due to gun violence and injustice. We have grown up afraid to exist. Yet, in our fear and our anger, we find strength and the courage to fight. While our innocence has been lost to unspeakable violence and ever-deepening grief, we haven't lost our ability to speak up and speak out.\par \par \uc2 Our power comes from knowing that our voices and our votes have shifted a narrative and a nation to bring needed change at local and national levels. In response to an epidemic of gun-related suicides and mass shootings, March for Our Lives wrote "The Peace Plan for a Safer America" - a comprehensive plan to cut gun violence deaths in half in 10 years. Twenty thousand lives could be saved annually.\par \par \uc2 Each day is a march. Each day is our chance to be heard and to stand for our rights. We deserve to live free of fear. We deserve to live free of gun violence.\par \par \uc2 Emma Gonz\u224\'00\'E0\u161\'00\'A1lez is a co-founder of March for Our Lives.\par \par \uc2 The far left is too pessimistic about the American Dream\par \par \uc2 By Avik Roy\par \par \uc2 If you spend a lot of time watching cable news, it's easy to conclude that Americans are hopelessly divided about what our country stands for. But we're actually deeply united on a fundamental American principle: the principle of equal opportunity for all. \uc2 Bill Clinton\uc2  used to say, "If you work hard and play by the rules, you should be given a chance to go as far as your God-given ability will take you." \uc2 Ronald Reagan\uc2  said, "The American dream [is] that wealth is denied to no one, that each individual has the right to fly as high as his strength and ability will take him." It's no accident that both Clinton and Reagan were popular two-term presidents.\par \par \uc2 One of the major differences between the far left and the rest of the country is that the far left is deeply pessimistic about the state of equal opportunity. A survey by a group called More in Common found that 54 percent of Americans agreed that "people who work hard can find success no matter what situation they were born into." By contrast, just 5 percent of "Progressive Activists" - the poll's most left-leaning respondents - agreed with this statement.\par \par \uc2 It's not surprising that some Democratic presidential contestants reflect this pessimism. There remain inequalities of opportunity, such as the persistence of poverty among African Americans, and the decreasing affordability of health care, housing and college.\par \par \uc2 But hard work still succeeds in America. There are 1.4 million more job openings in America than there are unemployed people. American entrepreneurs have given us access to previously unimaginable goods and services, and our political leaders can open up more areas for innovation.\par \par \uc2 Voters have always rewarded politicians of both parties who have faith in the American Dream.

This leaves more than two-thirds of the electorate up for grabs.\par \par \uc2 Whether progressive candidates on the left - Elizabeth Warren and \uc2 Bernie Sanders\uc2  - can claim a large enough share of these potential swing voters will depend less on inherent ideological predispositions than on the framing of the policy issues. True, the term "socialism" evokes mostly negative connotations among Republican-leaning voters. At the same time, according to the PRRI survey, nearly half (47 percent) of Republicans think "progressive" describes them somewhat or very well. And health care and jobs are two of the top three critical issues for uncommitted Americans. (The other is terrorism.)\par \par \uc2 Academic studies show that the disappearance of good jobs and attendant economic anxieties are key drivers behind the rejection of centrist politicians at the polls in both the United States and Europe. The areas of the country that went for Trump in 2016 after having voted for \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  in 2008 and 2012 lagged significantly behind the rest of the country in expanding employment and economic opportunity. Their relative position has continued to deteriorate in the first two years of Trump's administration.\par \par \uc2 Trump won in those "flipped counties" by wrapping a nativist narrative around their residents' discontent. A progressive Democratic candidate would instead offer remedies that directly treat the causes - by redressing fundamental power imbalances in the economy and through public investment in education, social programs, infrastructure and job creation financed by more-progressive taxation.\par \par \uc2 The choice that the Democratic Party faces is this: It can treat \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  as an aberration and prop up an economic regime that reproduces the status quo ante with cosmetic fixes. Or it can treat Trump as a symptom of an unsustainably unjust economic system that needs to be reformed at its core. Only the latter path will prevent the emergence of future Trumps.\par \par \uc2 Dani Rodrik\uc2  is a professor at the \uc2 Harvard Kennedy School\uc2  and co-director of Economics for Inclusive Prosperity.\par \par \uc2 Americans want a break from chaos - but also something more\par \par \uc2 By Marcia Davis\par \par \uc2 As a journalist, I'm not in the prediction business. It's too early to say what will happen in the Democratic nomination contest. Yet here is what I do know: American voters want more.\par \par \uc2 Even those folks who are supporters of President Trump want more, whether they know it or not. And I'm not talking about those folks who would like black and brown people, and others of color, to float away. I'm talking about the salvageable people. And there are more than a few, including those folks who voted for Trump on the down low.\par \par \uc2 The president's chaotic leadership style is exhausting. In some ways, this impeachment business is representative of that fatigue. We see the \uc2 U.S. House of Representatives\uc2  is gearing up to send articles of impeachment to the Senate, but I'm not anticipating a vote for his removal.\par \par \uc2 People who will be voting Democratic - including some independents, some "Never-Trumpers" and dyed-in-the-wool Dems - will be voting for a breather, a chance for calm. They want a break from all the chaos.\par \par \uc2 But many Democratic voters want more. They're looking for real help on health-care costs. Opportunity and job training. Immigration reform. Some help on education. And women's equality. (It's time, too, for a female president.) More effort on criminal justice. Real work on climate change. And they'd like some restoration of the country's international reputation.\par \par \uc2 Will Americans follow the Democratic Party's shift to the left? Yes. The question is just how much of a shift we are talking about. Either American voters will sink into an abyss of a downward spiral, or they will climb upward. Democratic voters aren't ready to storm the barricades, but they are ready to take the stairs, at least two at a time, to meaningful social change.\par \par \uc2 Americans want normalcy. But they also want progress.\par \par \uc2 Marcia Davis is a writer in Washington and a former articles editor and writer at the Post Magazine.\par \par \uc2 The shift to the left will work -\par \par \uc2 if everyone can vote\par \par \uc2 By Rebecca Solnit\par \par \uc2 I'd invert this question to say: America is far to the left of its political representation, and if we're lucky the Democrats will catch up with us. That is, the Americans who are eligible to vote believe far more sincerely in the importance of climate action, human rights and equality, social services, gun control and economic justice than the Americans who actually do vote. That's often cast as "why didn't those young/brown/black/poor people vote" by people uninterested in the answer. We know the answer.\par \par \uc2 Decades ago, Republicans faced a choice: They could adapt to an increasingly nonwhite America and try to win votes from people of color, or they could do their damnedest to prevent those people from voting. As we all know, they chose the second option. Former Kansas secretary of state \uc2 Kris Kobach\uc2 's Interstate Voter Registration Crosscheck program was a cynical means to remove legitimate voters from the rolls, as are some red states' new tactic of striking from the rolls anyone who didn't vote in a recent election. Voter identification laws disproportionately affected poor, nonwhite people. In many places, polls were closed, forcing voters to travel great distances; poorer places often had shoddy equipment; college students and people in poor precincts sometimes had to wait in line for hours - if they could afford to miss class or work or have someone watch the kids while they did so. As of 2016, 6 million citizens with felony convictions had their right to vote taken away - in Florida that meant 1 in 5 black voters before the laws were changed in 2018.\par \par \uc2 The country we live in has been shaped by the choices made by a disproportionately older, whiter, wealthier electorate - which is to say, more conservative. If this were a country where registering to vote and voting were protected as they should be, the voice of the voters would be heard. And that voice, or rather those voices, would choose to respond meaningfully to climate change, protect the most vulnerable and defend human rights. So the first job of a progressive agenda for 2020 is to protect the right to vote.\par \par \uc2 San Francisco writer, historian and activist Rebecca Solnit is the author of more than 20 books about geography, community, art, politics, hope and feminism. Her recent works include "Whose Story Is This? Old Conflicts, New Chapters" and a forthcoming memoir, "Recollections of My Nonexistence."\par \par \uc2 The case for cultural moderation\par \par \uc2 By Jonathan Rauch\par \par \uc2 I'll take the liberty of rephrasing the question two ways. First: "Democratic primary voters are moving left. Will the general electorate follow?" In 2020, the answer is: very possibly, even probably. But not because the general electorate is on board with the Sanders-Warren-AOC worldview; rather, it's because the voters get only two choices, and the alternative is \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 . His "Make America Great Again" base, though intense, is too small to carry him to a second term. He needs a contingent of pragmatic-minded voters, and he may be alienating them to the point where they will take a chance on a normally-too-far-left Democrat.\par \par \uc2 Which begs a second version of the question: "Democrats are moving left on economic and cultural issues. Will the country follow?" There, the likeliest answers are: definitely yes and probably no. In 2020, no one with a shot at winning (sorry, Bill Weld) is campaigning on a free-market, small-government agenda, because there's no demand for one. Trump's own economic agenda - big spending, big deficits, trade protectionism, interventionist subsidies - confirms the bipartisan collapse of Reagan-Thatcherism (except on tax cuts). On cultural issues, however, the country is not swinging left but bifurcating. Big coastal cities and college-educated voters are going one way; rural and heartland places and working-class voters are going the other. Younger voters are more culturally left-leaning, but a lot of minority voters are culturally conservative, so demographic change won't settle this argument anytime soon. And in the short run, Democrats need some of those rural and heartland working-class votes.\par \par \uc2 The takeaway from both answers? A smart formula for Democrats would be to lean left on economics but toward the center on culture. A good place to start might be by pushing back against politically correct thought-policing online and on campus. For, say, \uc2 Joe Biden\uc2  or \uc2 Pete Buttigieg\uc2 , a "Sister Souljah" moment or two could go a long way.\par \par \uc2 Jonathan Rauch is a senior fellow at the \uc2 Brookings Institution\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 On foreign policy, left and right are scrambled\par \par \uc2 By \uc2 Anne-Marie Slaughter\par \par \uc2 Democrats are actually moving both left and right on foreign policy. Democratic presidential candidates largely tilt left on both climate change and pulling back from foreign wars and global leadership (with the exception of \uc2 Joe Biden\uc2  and \uc2 Pete Buttigieg\uc2 ). On the other hand, they are almost all China hawks and mostly protectionist, at least relative to both \uc2 Bill Clinton\uc2  and \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 . That is ground that President Trump has staked out and held, so it's hard to describe it purely as "left."\par \par \uc2 The country is likely to follow. The majority of Americans agree that climate change is increasingly an existential threat, one that we are experiencing already. Fighting climate change is a domestic as well as global subject, but measures like a carbon tax with dividends returned to the public, which is attracting support on the right and the left, would require global agreement to avoid countries profiting from tax differentials.\par \par \uc2 The question of America's role in the world is framed as "should America be the global policeman" by people who would say no and as "should America continue to aspire to global leadership" by people who would say yes. Democrats have been questioning the value of leading through use of force and the deployment of troops since 2008, when the fault line of support for or opposition to the Iraq War helped Obama become the nominee over \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 . Even more important, the post-World War II vision of activist American leadership designed to rally our allies to help cool down hot spots and fight tyrants around the world is fading with the baby boomers who embraced it - on the right and the left.\par \par \uc2 Americans who think that our troops are overdeployed and our dollars are underappreciated abroad will be content with a foreign policy that seeks to lead more by the "power of our example" than the "example of our power," to borrow a line used by Democrats over the years. The majority will want to shore up our alliances and strengthen our diplomatic clout, but when it becomes apparent just how much that clout depends on the credible use of force, they are likely to balk. And for this Democrat, at least, some of the money we spend on making that threat credible is better spent on education, equity and energy - of the renewable kind.\par \par \uc2 Anne-Marie Slaughter\uc2  is CEO of New America.\par \par \uc2 Yes to moving left. No to ideological bubbles.\par \par \uc2 By Joshua DuBois\par \par \uc2 Democrats are right to find the injustices that remain in our country and work to root them out. If that focus is described as a "move to the left," then that move is a good and moral thing. More than 100 Americans die every day because of gun violence. Our climate is changing, and marginalized communities are threatened most by that change. Families are working well over 40 hours per week and still struggling to make ends meet. Individuals still face discrimination because of the color of their skin, whom they love or simply who they are. A country where we face fewer of these problems with each passing day is a country where I want to live.\par \par \uc2 However, we have to be careful to pipeline those priorities from people in communities themselves. This does not mean that we should slow the march toward progress. I believe strongly in what the \uc2 Rev. Martin Luther King Jr\uc2 . said in his "Letter From a Birmingham Jail": "Freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed. Frankly, I have never yet engaged in a direct action movement that was 'well timed.' " But leaders in our party, and influential voices in the broader progressive movement, must constantly assess not just the demands we are making but the source material for those demands. Are we rooting our causes in communities, or amplifying an existing echo chamber? Are we camouflaging self- or organizational interest as community interest?\par \par \uc2 The only way to check those motivations is to spend disproportionate time listening and learning stories from communities affected the most. Those stories - and the solutions that arise from them - are often more nuanced, careful, hopeful and ultimately righteous than the simple, uncompromising messages we tend to share in our own circles, online and offline.\par \par \uc2 Joshua DuBois was a White House adviser to President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  on faith, race and community partnerships.

Chen\par \par \uc2 Americans won't follow the Democrats to the left because the policy solutions that come with that move are ultimately unappealing. While the proposals being touted by leading progressive Democrats may sound good at first, further analysis almost always exposes their flaws.\par \par \uc2 A prime example of this is the way in which Elizabeth Warren and \uc2 Bernie Sanders\uc2  have been widely criticized - by Democrats and Republicans alike - for the Medicare-for-all plans that they support. The plans will displace current private insurance arrangements for hundreds of millions of Americans and are so expensive that neither Sanders nor Warren can honestly explain how they'll be paid for. Quite simply, Americans aren't ready to follow Democrats to the left if it means wrecking the health-care system we have now.\par \par \uc2 And there are other policy examples, too. Take Democrats' movement toward decriminalizing border crossings and their criticism of physical barriers at America's southern border. Or their support of wealth taxes that have rarely worked in any other country where they've been tried and often lead not to more tax revenue but more tax evasion. Or progressives' advocacy for policies to fight climate change that could raise the price of energy for many households, cost up to tens of trillions of dollars, and result in dramatic changes to the ways we live and work.\par \par \uc2 While these policies are appealing to the progressive Democrats who will largely populate the primaries and caucuses, they will be a challenge for Democrats once a broader electorate examines them more closely. It's hard to imagine that Americans will follow Democrats to the left if it means supporting the far-left ideas we've heard espoused by many presidential candidates this year. That's why we can expect the Democratic nominee for president - whoever she or he is - to pivot to a more palatable middle ground once the general-election campaign begins in earnest.\par \par \uc2 Lanhee J.

The shootings in Ohio and El Paso are proof that the Trump presidency has put Latinx lives at risk by emboldening those who think that this country should work just for white people.\par \par \uc2 We - as Latinx voters and, more broadly, voters of color - are leading the move to the left. We are demanding that the Democratic Party follow. This is a huge shift for a party that has historically ignored us except for last-ditch efforts leading up to an election. Through grass-roots organizations and networks like the Center for Popular Democracy Action, Mijente, Texas Organizing Project, CASA, Make the Road and others, we are pushing the Democratic Party to take our votes seriously and propose policies that create a future for all of us in this country. The movement of the Democratic Party to the left is a necessary step, but a reactive one.\par \par \uc2 Voters of color, including Latinx voters, are an increasing percentage of the American electorate - and our share will only grow bigger. There are 32 million Latinx voters who will be eligible to vote in the 2020 election. For us to turn out, we need a candidate who will commit to undoing the damage that Trump has caused us and to proactively promoting a vision for this country that includes us and allows us to thrive.\par \par \uc2 If a leftward move of the Democratic Party means a move to represent our voices, our perspectives and our interests, then that is the direction we should be headed.\par \par \uc2 Natalia Salgado is the national political director of the Center for Popular Democracy Action, a liberal organizing group based in New York.\par \par \uc2 The left-right spectrum has lost all meaning\par \par \uc2 By Katherine Mangu-Ward\par \par \uc2 The left-right spectrum is worse than useless for understanding the American ideological landscape. We live in a world where Fox News pundit and unofficial presidential adviser \uc2 Tucker Carlson\uc2  has kind words to say about Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren's extremely progressive economic policy proposals, but only because he thinks they will help restore traditional family structure and bring back blue-collar manufacturing jobs.\par \par \uc2 The snake isn't just eating its own tail, it appears to be vomiting it back up as well.\par \par \uc2 Since \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  became president and embarked on his convoluted trade war, Democrats have a newfound skepticism about tariffs. Republicans, meanwhile, are no longer troubled by deficit spending and even seem keen on some new entitlements, such as mandatory paid parental leave. Every major-party 2020 hopeful is campaigning on regulation of free speech online; Democrats want to bar hate speech on social media while Republicans are mad at massive corporations (!) for what they perceive as "censorship" of conservative opinions. Things are even more topsy-turvy in foreign policy, where a sitting Republican champions antiwar views (while oscillating wildly on implementation) and powerful Democrats take to the nation's op-ed pages to urge him to listen to the wise generals who favor the interventionist status quo.\par \par \uc2 All of which is to say: I'm not at all sure what it means to say the Democrats (or Americans) are moving left. But Americans seem increasingly comfortable with reactionary authoritarianism in its various guises. Both socialism and nationalism are experiencing resurgences in popularity after having spent decades in the doghouse for very good reasons. There is a bipartisan consensus emerging in favor of a larger, stronger and more-intrusive government. And that's a more telling - and worrying - trend than whatever the polls say about left or right.\par \par \uc2 Katherine Mangu-Ward is editor in chief of Reason magazine.\par \par \uc2 You can't defeat Trumpism without a broad coalition\par \par \uc2 By Neera Tanden\par \par \uc2 Under Trump's presidency, most Democrats - and much of the country - feel that America faces an existential threat to progressive values and to our democracy as a whole. That is why electability has become such a central issue in the Democratic primaries. But this debate is not just about the best candidate to beat Trump. It is also about the best kind of campaign and agenda to defeat him.\par \par \uc2 Part of the debate concerns ideology: whether the best strategy for winning is a left agenda that could energize the base, or a broader and more practical agenda that could attract swing voters. However, this is a false choice.\par \par \uc2 Only mobilizing the Democratic base may not be enough in 2020, since we know Trump will likely motivate his own core supporters. In fact, Trump's recent campaigning in the Louisiana governor's race turned out an additional 200,000 voters compared with the last election in 2015 - many of them white and rural - helping to force a runoff for the Democratic incumbent.\par \par \uc2 In 2020, Democrats can - and should - turn out their base, while simultaneously making their case to swing voters. That's precisely what happened in 2018. Participation rates among millennials and people of color soared, with the number of Latino voters nearly doubling from the previous midterm elections in 2014. But persuadable Trump voters played the more important role: According to Catalist, a progressive firm that tracks voter data, "Democratic gains were \u8230\'20\'26 largely driven by voters who voted for Trump in 2016 and voted Democratic in 2018."\par \par \uc2 We can have a bold agenda that also appeals to a wide spectrum of voters. For example, the \uc2 Center for American Progress\uc2  has released a proposal that would achieve universal health care by creating a national health plan similar to Medicare that's open to everyone, while allowing those who receive private insurance through their employers to keep their current plans. This approach receives broad support across the political landscape, including from a majority of Democrats in Iowa. What's more, it would not raise taxes on the middle class - making it less vulnerable to attacks from Trump while still providing coverage for all.\par \par \uc2 To end Trumpism, not just beat Trump, will take a major electoral defeat. That is possible, but it means building a broad coalition with a broad agenda.\par \par \uc2 Neera Tanden is president of the Center for American Progress Action Fund.\par \par \uc2 A centrist's case for a leftward tilt\par \par \uc2 By Elaine C. Kamarck\par \par \uc2 America is already there. Which is why, as an avowed centrist, I have no problem with my party's leftward tilt, especially on economic issues.\par \par \uc2 In recent decades the country has undergone what is often called the "financialization" of the economy: People who make money playing with money have become richer and more important than people who make things that we like and use such as iPhones and washing machines. Think of it as Wall Street takes out Main Street. This doctrine encompassed a set of behaviors that emphasized short-term returns to investors over long-term growth. The economist William Lazonick of the University of Massachusetts at Lowell has summed up these changes as a shift from "retain-and-reinvest to downsize-and-distribute." The results have cost Americans good jobs and hollowed out the middle class while increasing returns to an obscenely rich 1 percent.\par \par \uc2 This "vulture capitalism" plays out in several ways. One is through the work of so-called activist investors. Indeed, an activist-investor drama is taking place as I write. \uc2 Elliott Management Corp\uc2 ., a large hedge fund, has been buying stock in \uc2 AT&T\uc2 . Elliott has recently put \uc2 AT&T\uc2  on notice that it could be more profitable (i.e., have a higher short-term stock price) if it divested landline businesses and closed retail stores. The \uc2 Communications Workers of America\uc2 , a labor union, estimates that these suggestions could negatively affect 30,000 workers.\par \par \uc2 Average Americans have seen this happen hundreds of times in their own towns. It was one of the biggest reasons that, in 2012, \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2  lost the presidential election. I am neutral in the Democratic presidential race, but it is clear that anger at a capitalism that guts corporations and kills jobs to enrich the 1 percent is fueling the campaign of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, one of the first people to blow the whistle on it. When it comes to correcting the abuses of vulture capitalism, the Democratic Party's leftward tilt is a very real response to what has happened to Americans and their jobs.\par \par \uc2 Elaine C. Kamarck is a senior fellow at the \uc2 Brookings Institution\uc2 , where she edited a series titled "The Initiative on 21st Century Capitalism."\par \par \uc2 Fealty to intersectional politics spells doom\par \par \uc2 By Wesley Yang\par \par \uc2 At the recent LGBTQ candidates forum, Elizabeth Warren promised a 9-year-old transgender boy input into whom she would name to run the Department of Education.\par \par \uc2 Trans people make up a minuscule percentage of the electorate. And yet, this gesture - like other similar ones by her campaign - was a necessary symbolic act of fealty to a specific mode of politics. Warren was deferring to the activist cadres that run and staff the organs of the institutional left. This faction is situated at critical choke points of the nonprofit and governmental civil rights apparatus, which derives its power and authority from the manufacture of new protected classes on whose behalf the latest moral crusade requiring federal intervention can be launched. These factions in turn are axially allied with a novelty-seeking media that has a role in reporting what happened, but an even larger role, as the writer Ben Sixsmith has put it, in "memeing trends into existence."\par \par \uc2 The California state legislature recently tabled a model ethnic studies curriculum for public high school students, which the same body has repeatedly tried to make a graduation requirement. The curriculum calls on students to "critique empire and its relationship to white supremacy, racism, patriarchy, cisheteropatriarchy, capitalism, ableism, anthropocentrism and other forms of power and oppression," in order to "connect ourselves to past and contemporary resistance movements that struggle for social justice." This is the language around which this new administrative class has coalesced.\par \par \uc2 When the \uc2 Working Families Party\uc2  made the surprising choice to endorse Warren over \uc2 Bernie Sanders\uc2 , it was likely motivated by the concerns and interests of these cadres, who are pursuing the "intersectional" practice of stitching together a tapestry of identity groups in shared pursuit of the power vested in the federal government to regulate. Sanders is an old white man fixed in a mid-20th-century class politics that this coalition regards as essentially anachronistic, not just because of who he is but because, as an outsider to the institutional Democratic Party, he is a stranger to the administrative classes for whom the language of "ableism" and "cisheteropatriarchy" is the coin of the realm.\par \par \uc2 This intersectional approach is excellent at acquiring power through intramural struggle within institutions. It has been less successful in winning national elections. Whether the country follows the Democratic Party on its left turn largely depends on whether Warren or whoever the party picks as its standard-bearer can preserve some room to maneuver apart from the implacable demands of this faction. At the moment, I'm not optimistic.\par \par \uc2 Wesley Yang is a columnist for Tablet and the author of "The Souls of Yellow Folk."\par \par \uc2 Democrats are finally catching up on racial justice\par \par \uc2 By Peniel Joseph\par \par \uc2 Since at least Lyndon Johnson's Great Society, the Democratic Party, to both the benefit and the ill of its electoral prospects, has been identified as the party of social justice and racial equality. Losing five of six presidential contests between 1968 and 1988 prompted a rightward shift exemplified by \uc2 Bill Clinton\uc2 's politically deft yet morally reprehensible triangulation on the question of black America. Easily the most striking aspect of today's Democratic primary race has been the distance traveled, especially by some contenders, from the days when Clinton triumphantly passed criminal justice and welfare reform that penalized the black poor. The candid discussion of reparations for descendants of enslaved African Americans shows how far we've come since Democrats believed that racial scapegoating was necessary for electoral success.\par \par \uc2 The Obama coalition built its political strength on demographic transformations combined with the implicit belief that the election of a black president could both represent racial progress and contribute to the eradication of institutional racism. \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 's electoral coalition, based on explicit and ugly appeals to white nationalism, upended the racial optimism of 2008-2009 and liberated Democrats from speaking politely about racial equality while largely ignoring the promotion of racial justice as a policy agenda. The rise of Kamala Harris, \uc2 Ayanna Pressley\uc2  and \uc2 Stacey Abrams\uc2  has highlighted the fact that black women represent the party's "stickiest" voter, a loyal constituency that Democrats now need more than ever to reclaim the White House. On race matters, Democratic support of reparations, ending mass incarceration, universal health care and a living wage for all Americans recognizes right as well as reality.\par \par \uc2 Ultimately, for Democrats to regain the White House they must offer a political vision that recognizes the centrality of race to our national politics, but in a manner that pushes us closer to, rather than farther from, the "beloved community" that the \uc2 Rev. Martin Luther King Jr\uc2 . often evoked. For King that community required elected officials and ordinary citizens to wrestle with the legacy of slavery, the impact of Jim Crow and the prevalence of inequality throughout society. Contemporary Democrats bold enough to discuss the structural nature of racial inequality and the way race continues to shape positive and negative social, economic and political outcomes recognize that to achieve our country's highest aspirations requires plumbing the depths of its lowest historical moments. That means that Democrats are on the right path to not only electoral success but also a long overdue reckoning about the relationship between race and democracy. Will America follow? If Americans of all races and backgrounds who proudly joined the Obama coalition are given free and unfettered access to the polls next year, the answer promises to be a resounding yes.\par \par \uc2 Peniel Joseph is a professor of history and public affairs at the University of Texas at Austin, where he directs the Center for the Study of Race and Democracy.\par \par \uc2 Actually, Democrats are moving to the center\par \par \uc2 By Howard Dean\par \par \uc2 Much has been made of the supposed movement of the Democratic Party to the left. But the evidence suggests that the Democratic Party as a whole is more centrist than it was four years ago, while the electorate is moving from center-right to center-left.\par \par \uc2 First, while the four dynamic and outspoken women who make up "The Squad" were winning seats in Congress in 2018, Americans were also electing more than 30 other new representatives from Orange County, Calif., as well as Texas, Kansas, Oklahoma and Virginia, replacing very conservative members like Dave Brat, Dana Rohrabacher and Pete Sessions. These members, like \uc2 Conor Lamb\uc2 , who won two congressional elections in rural Pennsylvania last year, are centrist Democrats. Many of them are veterans.\par \par \uc2 Second, it is fair to say that the debate among presidential contenders skews left given the strong showings by Elizabeth Warren and \uc2 Bernie Sanders\uc2 . But \uc2 Joe Biden\uc2 , Amy Klobuchar and \uc2 Pete Buttigieg\uc2  have staked out more-moderate positions, and the latter two are climbing. Kamala Harris also appears to be portraying herself as a practical progressive.\par \par \uc2 Finally, the Democrats' rise is entirely because our party base is increasingly young, female and of color. But the younger generation, which elected \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 , is in many ways more moderate than mine. Gay rights, diversity, climate change and women's reproductive freedom are critical issues for them, but they also don't trust big institutions - including political parties, government, religious authoritarians, big corporations and labor unions.\par \par \uc2 The most interesting phenomenon to me, however, is that roughly 70 percent of under-35s, independent of ethnicity and gender, vote for Democrats, not because they love the party but because our values and their values are mostly a good fit. Republican values are too authoritarian, too spendthrift and too oriented toward corporate donors to appeal to this generation anytime soon. This new generation is fiscally moderate and socially very progressive with a streak of libertarianism, and they are now the largest voting bloc in the electorate. Even as they are dragging the Democrats toward the center, they are also dragging the politics of the country as a whole leftward because they are so overwhelmingly socially conscious compared with the more authoritarian and much older generation of Republican voters.\par \par \uc2 Howard Dean served as governor of Vermont from 1991 to 2003 and as chair of the Democratic National Committee from 2005 to 2009.

To ease these burdens we should empower people, not the government; however, many Democrats have proposed policies like taking away private health insurance from millions of people or ending the energy revolution we are currently benefiting from. These policies will negatively affect all Americans by weakening our economy and national security. For every family to have a chance at the American Dream, we must promote prosperity through free markets, not socialism.\par \par \uc2 Representing one of the most swing districts in the country, I know that reasonable Democrats and independents share these concerns and agree on the solutions. That's how I've defied the odds and continued to win.\par \par \uc2 Rep.

Friedberg\par \par \uc2 Democrats may be running hard to the left on domestic policy, but on foreign policy at least the more "progressive" among them appear to be headed in the same direction as President Trump: toward a greatly diminished U.S. world role.\par \par \uc2 Like their arch-nemesis, progressive Democrats want to end the nation's "endless" wars and to avoid future military interventions, especially in the Middle East. Like Trump, they are skeptical of the benefits of free trade and believe that the international economic system has been "rigged" to benefit "globalist" elites. And, like Trump, they want to focus on "making America great again" or, as they might prefer, on "nation-building at home."\par \par \uc2 There are differences, of course. Trump is scornful of international institutions, denigrates America's traditional allies and defines the nation's interests in narrowly material terms. Progressives, by contrast, speak the lofty language of human rights and universal values, and hope to find cooperative, multilateral solutions to every global problem. Trump's desire to put "America first" risks leaving it isolated. The progressives' inclination to turn inward, cut defense spending and unfurl massive social welfare programs risks allowing external challenges to grow unchecked.\par \par \uc2 There are less-extreme voices to be heard on both sides of the political aisle, including from a few of the Democratic candidates and some congressional Republicans, as well as many former Democratic officials and their currently exiled "Never Trump" Republican counterparts. Dismissed by their parties' populists as out-of-touch and irrelevant, the views of these centrists may actually be closer to those of most Americans. A recent report by the \uc2 Chicago Council on Global Affairs\uc2  shows that significant majorities - despite favoring a measure of restraint - still express support for preserving military superiority, maintaining alliances, pursuing trade and promoting democracy. In other words, although the necessary leadership may be lacking at the moment among both Republicans and Democrats, public support for an active, engaged U.S. foreign policy remains strong.\par \par \uc2 Aaron L. Friedberg is a professor of politics and international affairs at Princeton University.\par \par \uc2 One of the two Americas is shifting left\par \par \uc2 By Tanzina Vega\par \par \uc2 It depends on which America you're talking about. Despite the Mueller report, the impeachment inquiry, multiple allegations of sexual misconduct and abuse, racial animus toward immigrants and asylum seekers, and deeply unpopular foreign policy initiatives, support for President Trump has remained around 40 percent. Expecting his base to shift is useless.\par \par \uc2 As a nation, however, we're becoming more racially diverse and less religious. We are also less able to get and sustain wealth. The yawning inequality gap in the United States has many Americans, young and old, disillusioned about the so-called American Dream. From digital media companies in cities like New York to factory floors in the Midwest, workers across the country are demanding better pay and protections from an increasingly automated economy. Americans are also scarred from the exorbitant costs of health care and prescription drugs, and from an opioid crisis that has devastated families and communities. All of these things have pushed younger Democrats further from the political center than their parents, and have invigorated marginalized groups to become more vocal in the fight for civil rights and economic justice.\par \par \uc2 The majority of Americans disapprove of the job this president is doing, and they want to see change. We already hear Democratic presidential candidates talking about concepts like the racial wealth gap, growing income inequality, criminal justice reform and LGBTQ rights in far more progressive terms than would have been thinkable during the last election cycle.\par \par \uc2 There is a fierce debate happening among Democratic voters about which candidate they'd prefer to have as a nominee. Younger voters of color seem captivated by Juli\u224\'00\'E0\u161\'00\'A1n Castro's progressive stances on many of these issues as opposed to \uc2 Joe Biden\uc2 's centrist and at times rambling approach to maintaining the status quo. Kamala Harris, a woman of color, has taken her share of criticism for her prosecutorial past, while \uc2 Bernie Sanders\uc2 , a white man in his 70s, nabbed an endorsement from progressive millennial icon Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. But in the end, I suspect Democrats will have no choice but to vote for whoever runs against Trump, regardless of how progressive (or not) they happen to be.\par \par \uc2 Tanzina Vega is host of the nationally syndicated public radio show "The Takeaway" from WNYC and PRX.\par \par \uc2 Voters want an end to our rigged economic system\par \par \uc2 By \uc2 Sheila Bair\par \par \uc2 The tango requires close synchronization between two partners. For decades, the government and moneyed interests have been performing a political version of it, gliding across a ballroom strewn with special breaks, boondoggles and bailouts. The failure of the Democratic ticket to acknowledge this unseemly pas de deux led to its defeat in 2016. This time around, most of the Democratic presidential candidates have felt the public's not-so-gentle tap on their shoulders and have vowed that their administration will partner with the public electorate who brought them to the ball. Yet, to do so, they promise a bigger and more powerful government - the same government that has been so willing to let profiteers fill its dance card in the past.\par \par \uc2 Democrats have been as willing as Republicans to tango with the rent-reaping lounge lizards. Time and again, well-intended government programs aimed at expanded public access to health care, education or homeownership are co-opted by profit-seeking concerns. Tax breaks meant to spur economic growth instead exacerbate yawning economic inequality while inflating bubbles, as tax-advantaged dollars chase too few opportunities for real economic growth. Government regulators become captive of the regulated. Whether it's plane crashes or financial crashes, the public is put at risk.\par \par \uc2 The general electorate wants to break up the dance party. This includes many business leaders who are also fed up with government waste and favoritism. But they will be skeptical of more government as the solution. \uc2 Andrew Yang\uc2 's idea for giving financial support directly to families - cutting out the government and industry middlemen - may have particular appeal. Ultimately, the person will be more important than the policy, giving the edge to a candidate such as Elizabeth Warren, who has made restoring independence, integrity and trust in government a centerpiece of her campaign. That is the kind of leadership Americans need to bounce the cronies off the dance floor.\par \par \uc2 Sheila Bair\uc2  is director of the Volcker Alliance, a nonpartisan group that aims to improve the efficiency of government. She was the chair of the \uc2 Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) \uc2 from 2006 to 2011.\par \par \uc2 Borders with justice are in sync with America\par \par \uc2 By Hiroshi Motomura\par \par \uc2 Republicans try hard to cast Democratic presidential candidates as "open borders" advocates, feeding the narrative that Democrats are "moving left." But nothing suggests that the Democratic candidates are especially "left" on immigration. In fact, they are very mainstream. Rather than wondering if America will follow, it's more accurate to say that the Democrats are following America.\par \par \uc2 What do Democratic candidates and many Americans find deeply troubling? Not just separating children from parents, but sidestepping the rules in U.S. immigration law requiring full asylum hearings before immigration judges. Not just keeping spouses from living together in the United States, but doing so with a "travel ban" targeting six Muslim countries. Not just ending the humane treatment of young undocumented immigrants under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy, but ignoring Congress's requirements that any administration articulate rational reasons for policy changes. Broad public revulsion with the administration's immigration policies has nothing to do with open borders. The Democrats are actually defending borders and U.S. sovereignty - by insisting on borders with justice.\par \par \uc2 Borders allow us to promote equality and dignity on the inside, as a way to build a stronger America. But if borders are to help create a just society, they must be ethical borders. This means that presidents must not weaponize immigration to stoke racial and religious prejudice or to divide Americans. Presidents must not use race, ethnicity or religion to treat some Americans better than others. It cannot matter if you are from Nigeria or Norway, Syria or Slovenia. Enforcement cannot be especially harsh against migrants from Latin America. Presidents must not ride roughshod over the immigration framework that Congress has enacted into statutes. Presidents must not ignore the basic principles of fairness that make sure enforcement is consistent with the rule of law.\par \par \uc2 But this administration is guilty of all these fundamental violations, undermining why we have borders in the first place. When Democratic candidates object, they aren't supporting open borders. If Democrats make it clearer that they want borders with justice, they will be on the same page as the vast majority of Americans.\par \par \uc2 Hiroshi Motomura is a professor at the UCLA School of Law specializing in immigration and citizenship.\par \par \uc2 Democrats must refuse to be (falsely) called radicals\par \par \uc2 By Mois\u233\'00\'E9s Na\u224\'00\'E0\u173\'00\'ADm\par \par \uc2 Americans will not follow politicians who fit the caricature that \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  and Fox News use to depict opponents of the incumbent president.\par \par \uc2 America-hating, \uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2 -loving, soft-on-crime radical socialists will not do well with voters. Fortunately, these radical socialists are scarce and not very influential. Unfortunately, they are omnipresent in Trump's speeches and tweets.\par \par \uc2 Politicians with credible proposals to solve the concrete problems that besiege Americans will do well with voters who are unwilling to take the president's claims at face value. That is why persuading voters to double-check the president's accusations and denounce his exaggerations and falsehoods will be important goals of his adversaries. But that will not be enough. The attacks of the president and his supporters need to be answered with a pragmatic stance and concrete solutions. For example, Democrats should keep reminding voters that a more affordable health care that is available to more Americans is not a left- or right-wing issue. It is what any citizen of one of the richest countries in the world has the right to expect.\par \par \uc2 Contrary to the \uc2 National Rifle Association\uc2 's rhetoric, banning assault rifles designed to massacre a large number of people in a short period of time or requiring background checks for gun buyers are not measures promoted by the left to undermine America. These are treated as common-sense ideas anywhere else in the world - and, increasingly, by American voters as well.\par \par \uc2 Suspending U.S. foreign aid to the Central American countries where hellish living conditions prompt hundreds of thousands of people to seek refuge in the United States is not a smart, hawkish right-wing, anti-\uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2  policy. It is, instead, a self-inflicted wound that weakens America because it boosts the pressures Central Americans have to leave their homes and flee north.\par \par \uc2 Defending the human rights of oppressed people everywhere is not a right or left issue either. It is one of the goals that the foreign policy of the world's most powerful democracy should never abandon even if, at times, it may conflict with other national interests.\par \par \uc2 Americans are pragmatists, not ideologues. Voters will follow candidates who speak to their concrete needs and aspirations. The challenge for Democrats is to show that Trump's policies, while at times seductive, are in fact poisonous and often hurt the great majority of Americans. And to show that the policies he routinely denounces as radical are no such thing.\par \par \uc2 Mois\u233\'00\'E9s Na\u224\'00\'E0\u173\'00\'ADm is a distinguished fellow at the \uc2 Carnegie Endowment for International Peace\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 LGBT equality isn't a left-right issue anymore\par \par \uc2 By Sharon McGowan\par \par \uc2 As significant as our legal victories have been since the Stonewall riots 50 years ago, perhaps more important has been the increase in social acceptance for LGBT people and our families. While there are certainly far too many places where anti-LGBT discrimination is rampant, it is no longer possible to describe support for LGBT civil rights as some kind of radical "lefty" position. We know this because a majority of people support marriage equality in 44 of the 50 states; 71 percent support transgender people serving in the military; over two-thirds support laws that "would protect gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender people against discrimination in jobs, public accommodations, and housing"; and six in 10 Americans are also opposed to businesses refusing to provide products and services to gay and lesbian people for religious reasons. In other words, far from causing "social upheaval," the vindication of LGBT civil rights sits comfortably within the political mainstream.\par \par \uc2 Unfortunately, however, we continue to see anti-LGBT forces fighting this wave of public acceptance with every tool in their arsenal. For example, as cities in red states across the country increasingly try to expand protections against discrimination, deeply conservative - and often highly gerrymandered - state legislatures shut down these efforts by claiming that such local ordinances are preempted by state law.\par \par \uc2 Perhaps the most troubling trend is the packing of our federal judiciary with anti-LGBT ideologues. Notwithstanding far-reaching acceptance for our civil rights, this administration has succeeded in confirming judges at a record pace. Because these are lifetime appointments, we are now facing a generation or more of a federal judiciary that will be taking aim at our civil rights, and not surprisingly, our opponents are more emboldened than ever. Therefore, we cannot become complacent, and must recommit ourselves to the fight for full equality.\par \par \uc2 But make no mistake about it: This is no longer an issue of left vs. right. We know it, and the rest of the country does, too.\par \par \uc2 Sharon McGowan is chief strategy officer and legal director at Lambda Legal, the nation's oldest civil rights organization for LGBT rights and people with HIV.\par \par \uc2 Voters are ready for bold action\par \par \uc2 By Richard Cordray\par \par \uc2 The American people are demanding progress toward real answers for the major problems we face. They want bold action. Most of us want a lasting solution to the constant threat that health-care costs pose to our families. The Trump administration utterly failed to "repeal and replace" Obamacare yet is still trying to dismantle the gains made to broaden coverage, control costs and protect those with preexisting conditions. On climate change, most people accept the overwhelming evidence and recognize the growing frequency of extreme weather events. They want meaningful action on renewable energy and new leadership to rebuild our global alliances to address this existential threat to our planet. Families want their children to be able to get the education and training they need to compete in our fast-moving economy without drowning in debt. And people are chafing at the dramatic and increasing income inequality that is driving down prospects for the middle class.\par \par \uc2 Despite inheriting a strong economy, the Trump administration has pushed the deficit to nearly a trillion dollars this year, with little to show for it except irresponsible tax cuts that benefit those who are already wealthy. On the major issues - health care, climate change, access to higher education and job training, income inequality and so much more - most Americans believe that we need to deliver big structural changes to move our country forward. They want practical reforms, but they will not be content with small half-measures. This same feeling gripped the country with the progressive movement, the New Deal and the Reagan Revolution. Americans seek real leadership on these issues, and the Democrats must offer a persuasive vision with the courage and determination to make it happen.\par \par \uc2 Richard Cordray was the 2018 Democratic gubernatorial candidate in Ohio. He was the first director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and is a former Ohio attorney general.\par \par \uc2 'Not \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 ' isn't enough\par \par \uc2 By Prachi Gupta\par \par \uc2 In the wake of Trump's election, establishment Democrats struggled to find a more compelling vision than just "We are not \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 ." In July 2017, former congressman \uc2 Joe Crowley\uc2  told the Associated Press that the party's message was still "being worked on." Almost a year later Crowley, the fourth most powerful Democrat in the House, was ousted by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a 28-year-old democratic socialist. After her primary victory, Ocasio-Cortez told MSNBC: "We have to stick to the message: What are we proposing to the American people? Not, 'What are we fighting against?' " Within a year, the once-fringe ideas she championed - like the Green New Deal - have forced Democratic presidential candidates to move left.\par \par \uc2 Of course, many party leaders still are not on board with this shift, and recent polls indicate that almost half of Americans find the party too radical. Yet if Democratic leaders run back to the center, as they have in the past, they will risk repeating the mistakes of \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  and handing another victory to Trump. Rather than chase the elusive swing Republican voter, Democratic leadership should lean harder into a movement that is so clearly animating its base.\par \par \uc2 Republicans have normalized right-wing extremism, both in rhetoric and policy. If America is to follow Democrats to the left (or even back to the center), Democrats must unify behind a strong, bold vision; they must reframe public debates around abortion, democratic socialism, immigration and climate change; and they must find a way to translate their values into terms that resonate with working-class people, people of color and young people - even in deeply red pockets. Gen Z is the most ethnically and racially diverse generation in U.S. history. To lead them, Democrats need to offer a brighter future, rather than simply trying to avoid the past.\par \par \uc2 Prachi Gupta is author of the upcoming biography "AOC: Fighter, Phenom, Changemaker," and has written for such publications as Jezebel, Cosmopolitan.com and Salon.\par \par \uc2 On the economy, Americans are already there\par \par \uc2 By Heidi Shierholz\par \par \uc2 The answer to "The Democrats are moving left. Will America follow?" is no, because America is already there. Poll after poll shows that the large majority of progressive policies are already deeply popular.\par \par \uc2 Take the minimum wage. Pollsters have always found broad support for minimum-wage increases. Polls conducted earlier this year show a majority of Americans support increasing the minimum wage to $15, which is where the vast majority of Democratic presidential candidates stand on the issue.\par \par \uc2 What about unions? Many Democratic candidates have very progressive labor platforms - which is exactly what workers want, since although less than 12 percent of workers are in a union, the share jumps to over 50 percent if you include nonunion workers who report they want to be in a union.\par \par \uc2 Polling shows that most Republicans and Democrats support maintaining or increasing spending on Social Security, and that most Americans support higher taxes on the wealthy and corporations, paid family and medical leave, and on and on. In proposing these things, the Democrats are simply catching up to what America wants.\par \par \uc2 This doesn't mean the work of progressive leaders is completely done. For example, while a large majority of Americans say they support Medicare "for all who want it," support drops to less than 50 percent when respondents are asked whether they support Medicare-for-all that eliminates private insurance. In other words, on some things, more work will be needed to pull people along, and Democrats need a plan to convince the skeptical. But these are the exceptions, not the rule. On most progressive policies, Democrats' move to the left has simply moved them closer to where America was all along.\par \par \uc2 Heidi Shierholz is a senior economist and director of policy at the Economic Policy Institute.

With rampant racism and historic inequality, this is a time for strong leadership.\par \par \uc2 The last few election cycles in Florida prove we can energize a broad coalition of young people, black and brown communities, women and more around dynamic leaders with transformative policies. In 2016, Democrats lost Florida after nominating a candidate who did not motivate our base. Many of our voters stayed home, while the other side used fear and division to galvanize its base. In comparison, 2018 saw the biggest upset in Florida in the past 20 years when a bold, progressive black candidate won the Democratic nomination for governor, even after being heavily outspent by a large number of well-known middle-of-the-road candidates. Floridians heard \uc2 Andrew Gillum\uc2  and saw themselves represented in his story, his values and his vision for a state where we all belong. While he narrowly lost the governor's mansion by less than half a percentage point, he garnered more votes than any Democratic contender in the past 20 years. He engaged and inspired young voters and voters of color, who don't vote at the same rates as their white counterparts.\par \par \uc2 In Florida, we are coming together to build a new majority of voters that is demanding real leadership, not politicians who don't come from our communities and are too afraid to talk about what is really affecting our lives. Will Democrats follow?\par \par \uc2 Andrea Mercado is executive director of the New Florida Majority.\par \par \uc2 Democrats are in danger of going too far\par \par \uc2 By Ruy Teixeira\par \par \uc2 Is the country moving to the left? Absolutely. Are the Democrats moving to the left? Absolutely. Could the Democrats move too far to the left? Absolutely.\par \par \uc2 Consider the evidence. According to political scientist James Stimson's public policy mood index - which measures sentiment across a wide range of policies - Americans' support for government action is now at its highest level since the 1960s. Thus the idea that the country is moving to the left is not wishful thinking on the part of liberal pundits and politicians.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, it can scarcely be disputed that the Democrats are moving to the left. Simply look at the range of measures under discussion in the primary debates. Even the leading "moderate" candidate, \uc2 Joe Biden\uc2 , is pushing policies substantially to the left of what \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  ran on in 2016, including a public health insurance plan open to all Americans.\par \par \uc2 But it also cannot be disputed that Democrats could run too far to the left for even a country that is moving leftward. Take some of the policies that have been under discussion in the Democratic debates and pushed by Democratic activists:\par \par \uc2 1. Reparations for the descendants of slaves. This is massively unpopular. It would be more consistent with a country moving leftward to advocate needed social programs that happen to disproportionately benefit black Americans because of their income, education or location.\par \par \uc2 2. Decriminalizing the border or abolishing ICE. Neither of these measures is remotely consistent with the views of the public. It would make more sense for Democrats to advocate for reforming the enforcement agency plus a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants plus a humane immigration policy that still includes border security.\par \par \uc2 3. Medicare-for-all that eliminates private insurance. The polling could not be clearer: What the public really wants is Medicare-for-anyone or Medicare-for-all-who-want-it. This is embodied in the DeLauro-Schakowsky Medicare for America bill, as well as in the positions of some of the more moderate Democratic candidates.\par \par \uc2 4. A Green New Deal that commits to 100 percent renewable energy within 10 years. The public is not on board with anything quite so ambitious, but there is significant support for a Green New Deal that would focus on jobs, infrastructure and research.\par \par \uc2 In my view, these are the "four don'ts" of the 2020 campaign. Avoiding these are the key to Democrats moving smoothly to the left along with the country as a whole.\par \par \uc2 Ruy Teixeira is a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress Action Fund.\par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com\par \par \uc2 WP20191117left1117\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020191117efbh00047\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National-Politics\par {\*\bkmkstart toc8}{\*\bkmkend toc8}\b \uc2 Democrats extend their dominance of the suburbs, with an eye to 2020\b0\par\par\uc2 By Robert Costa;Michael Scherer \par \uc2 1,476 \uc2 words\par \uc2 7 November 2019\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2019, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 New flashes of Democratic electoral strength Tuesday from the outskirts of Memphis, Cincinnati and Philadelphia to the neighborhoods of Northern Virginia marked an advancement of the party's dominance across America's fast-changing suburbs.\par \par \uc2 The results underscored the profound electoral realignment that has been unfolding since President Trump's ascent upended the nation's political dynamics, marking the third time since his 2016 victory that Republicans lost ground in those communities while solidifying their hold on rural areas.\par \par \uc2 An apparent Democratic win Tuesday in Kentucky's gubernatorial race, as well as the Democratic takeover of the Virginia state legislature, left Republicans stumbling and increasingly uncertain about their own political fates.\par \par \uc2 "It was a rough night," said Scott Reed, the chief political strategist for the \uc2 U.S. Chamber of Commerce\uc2 . "There is a lot of positive news around President Trump's governing on the economy, on regulations and judges, and it seems to be overwhelmed by the drama."\par \par \uc2 Sky-blue campaign signs in Delaware County, Pa., a historically Republican Philadelphia suburb where Democrats swept the ballot box, told the story of how even local council contests had been nationalized.\par \par \uc2 "Had enough Trump? Flip Delco Nov. 5th," said the signs, which were stuck on roadsides and outside polling places.\par \par \uc2 "The state is flipping its political identity," said Larry Ceisler, a Democratic media consultant in Philadelphia. "The suburbs that used to be moderate Republican suburbs, controlled by the GOP, are almost totally blue, going all the way down to seats on the school boards. Individuals did not matter."\par \par \uc2 Many Republican candidates across the country, meanwhile, fell back on the polarizing campaign style that Trump has embraced, denouncing Democratic rivals as "socialist" and warning of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  invasions, a strategy that, while spurned in the suburbs, helped them succeed in more rural places such as southwestern Pennsylvania, where Republicans made gains in local elected offices.\par \par \uc2 Trump's rural strength helped him flip Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan, traditionally Democratic states, to gain his electoral college victory. But since then, the losses in suburban areas have had far greater electoral impact, driving the nation's political shift since the 2016 election. As president, Trump has seen a 47-seat Republican advantage in the U.S. House become a 36-seat deficit, largely because of suburban defections. The number of Republican-held governorships has fallen from 33 to 26, and the percentage of state legislative seats controlled by the party has fallen from 57 to 52.\par \par \uc2 "Republicans aren't leaning in on the issues that affect suburban, affluent voters like gun safety and the environment," said former congressman Ryan Costello (R), who retired from his Chester County, Pa., seat in 2018 rather than face reelection. "Plus, Trump is not a benefit but a burden. That forces Republicans to have to ask voters to really hear them out on issues like taxes and school safety even if those voters don't like Trump and that's not easy."\par \par \uc2 Trump is showing no sign of shifting his approach, and his campaign, always wary of broadcasting weakness, defiantly made the case of Trump's strength as Tuesday's Republican setbacks became apparent.\par \par \uc2 Over three tweets or retweets in one hour on Tuesday night, Trump claimed that \uc2 Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin\uc2  had been down "at least 15\u160\'00\'A0points," "17 points" and "maybe 20!" before he visited the state on Monday for a rally.\par \par \uc2 A mid-October poll by Mason-Dixon found the race tied, 46\u160\'00\'A0percent to 46 percent. Bevin, who has refused to concede defeat and called for a recanvassing of ballots, was trailing by less than a single percentage point Wednesday morning.\par \par \uc2 Trump's campaign manager, \uc2 Brad Parscale\uc2 , dismissed the journalistic analysis of Bevin's Democratic rival, \uc2 Andy Beshear\uc2 , the son of a former governor who declared victory, as "full of crap."\par \par \uc2 "The Democrats nominated a moderate, who's dad was a moderate, who didn't talk about impeachment or Trump, and who acts like a Republican," Parscale wrote. "Talk about Kentucky when an actual Democrat runs."\par \par \uc2 But county-level results in the state showed that regardless of Beshear's strengths and Bevin's weakness, suburban areas, particularly outside of Cincinnati, underperformed historical trends for Republicans.\par \par \uc2 The same shift was also evident in Mississippi, where Republican \uc2 Tate Reeves\uc2  easily won the governorship. Outside Memphis, Reeves carried 61 percent of the vote, compared with four years ago when the Republican candidate for governor won 80 percent of the vote, according to an analysis by Inside Elections. In Madison County, Miss., which includes tony suburbs of Jackson, the Republican vote margin in the gubernatorial race fell from 69 percent to 49 percent.\par \par \uc2 The same problems continue to roil Republican politics in other states. Texas House Speaker Dennis Bonnen (R) recently announced he would step aside after he was caught on tape admitting to concerns about Trump's weakness. "With all due respect to Trump, who I love by the way \u8212\'20\'14 he's killing us in the urban-suburban districts," Bonnen said in the recording, according to a transcript.\par \par \uc2 Trump's campaign hopes those shifts will not prove decisive in 2020, when Trump's reelection will depend on his success in swing states such as Wisconsin, Michigan, Florida and Pennsylvania, where there are large rural and non-college-educated populations to offset suburban voters.\par \par \uc2 Republicans also are hoping for help in 2020 from the Democratic nominee for president, given the liberal tilt of high-polling candidates such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and \uc2 Sen. Bernie Sanders\uc2  (I-Vt.), who are calling for a Medicare-for-all plan that would replace the current health insurance system.\par \par \uc2 "We need good candidates who run good campaigns who can speak to college-educated voters," said Corry Bliss, a Republican strategist, who ran a super PAC for House candidates in 2018. "Thankfully for us, the only other party in American politics is the Democratic Party, and their front-runner just released a proposal that will cost $30 trillion and eliminate private health insurance."\par \par \uc2 A Washington Post-ABC News poll released last week found sharp differences in views of Trump between college-educated voters and those who did not get a college degree. About 6 in 10 college graduates strongly disapprove of Trump's job performance, compared with 42 percent of those without college degrees.\par \par \uc2 The divide is also sharp when it comes to the underlying facts driving the impeachment investigation now targeting Trump. While 64 percent of college graduates said Trump had done something wrong in his dealings with Ukraine, half of those without degrees said the same thing, according to the poll.\par \par \uc2 Of next year's likely swing states, Pennsylvania may provide the most significant challenge to Trump, given the large suburban voting pools within commuting distance of Philadelphia and Pittsburgh.\par \par \uc2 "GOP should be most concerned about what happened in local elections in Chester, Delaware and Bucks County, PA," tweeted Josh Holmes, a confidant of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). "That is genuinely alarming if you know the voting history."\par \par \uc2 Trump's campaign and White House staff have launched fitful efforts to reach out to suburban voters around issues including prescription drugs, student loans and teenage e-cigarette usage. They also hope to drive turnout among more rural parts of the state.\par \par \uc2 "Trump's base is rural and small-town Pennsylvania, white working-class voters whose ancestors worked in the mines and in the mills," said G. Terry Madonna, a political science professor at Franklin and Marshall College. "Voters in the suburbs and rural, small-town America are on very different paths when it comes to the future of the country.The real fear that the Republicans have is that if the suburbs are the most populous areas and if this trend continues, the problems could worsen."\par \par \uc2 Democratic strategists, as they did in 2018, coached candidates to focus on messages about health care and other pocketbook matters, with issues such as Medicaid expansion bolstering Beshear in Kentucky and playing a central role in Democratic victories in Virginia.\par \par \uc2 Scott Kosar, a Democratic consultant who had multiple winning candidates in Virginia, said he was shocked to see some of them being attacked as \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 -loving socialists by their Republican rivals in places where that sort of politics did not work in state elections in 2017 and seemed unlikely to succeed this year.\par \par \uc2 "It sure seems that Republicans have forgotten how to run persuasion campaigns. All they do is polarize the electorate," Kosar said. "If you look at their success over the last 10 years, they have won by winning in places with historical Democrats who now vote like federal Republicans. That is now over."\par \par \uc2 robert.costa@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 michael.scherer@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 Aaron Blake contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020191107efb700002\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved \par \par \uc2 New flashes of Democratic electoral strength Tuesday from the outskirts of Memphis, Cincinnati and Philadelphia to the neighborhoods of Northern Virginia marked a new advancement of the party's dominance across America's fast-changing suburbs.\par \par \uc2 The results underscored the profound electoral realignment that has been unfolding since President Trump's ascent upended the nation's political dynamics, marking the third time since his 2016 victory that Republicans lost ground in those communities while solidifying their hold on rural areas.\par \par \uc2 An apparent Democratic win Tuesday in Kentucky's gubernatorial race, as well as the Democratic takeover of the Virginia state legislature, left Republicans stumbling and increasingly uncertain about their own political fates.\par \par \uc2 "It was a rough night," said Scott Reed, the chief political strategist for the \uc2 U.S. Chamber of Commerce\uc2 . "There is a lot of positive news around President Trump's governing on the economy, on regulations and judges, and it seems to be overwhelmed by the drama."\par \par \uc2 Sky-blue campaign signs in Delaware County, Pa., a historically Republican Philadelphia suburb where Democrats swept the ballot box, told the story of how even local council contests had been nationalized.\par \par \uc2 "Had enough Trump? Flip Delco Nov. 5th," said the signs, which were stuck on roadsides and outside polling places.\par \par \uc2 "The state is flipping its political identity," said Larry Ceisler, a Democratic media consultant in Philadelphia. "The suburbs that used to be moderate Republican suburbs, controlled by the GOP, are almost totally blue, going all the way down to seats on the school boards. Individuals did not matter."\par \par \uc2 Many Republican candidates across the country, meanwhile, fell back on the polarizing campaign style that Trump has embraced, denouncing Democratic rivals as "socialist" and warning of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  invasions, a strategy that, while spurned in the suburbs, helped them succeed in more rural places such as southwestern Pennsylvania, where Republicans made gains in local elected offices.\par \par \uc2 Trump's rural strength helped him flip Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan, traditionally Democratic states, to gain his electoral college victory. But since then, the losses in suburban areas have had far greater electoral impact, driving the nation's political shift since the 2016 election. As president, Trump has seen a 47-seat Republican advantage in the U.S. House become a 36-seat deficit, largely because of suburban defections. The number of Republican-held governorships has fallen from 33 to 26, and the percentage of state legislative seats controlled by the party has fallen from 57 to 52.\par \par \uc2 "Republicans aren't leaning in on the issues that affect suburban, affluent voters like gun safety and the environment," said former congressman Ryan Costello (R), who retired from his Chester County, Pa., seat in 2018 rather than face reelection. "Plus, Trump is not a benefit but a burden. That forces Republicans to have to ask voters to really hear them out on issues like taxes and school safety even if those voters don't like Trump and that's not easy."\par \par \uc2 Trump is showing no sign of shifting his approach, and his campaign, always wary of broadcasting weakness, defiantly made the case of Trump's strength as Tuesday's Republican setbacks became apparent.\par \par \uc2 Over three tweets or retweets in one hour on Tuesday night, Trump claimed that \uc2 Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin\uc2  had been down "at least 15 points," "17 points" and "maybe 20!" before he visited the state on Monday for a rally.\par \par \uc2 A mid-October poll by Mason-Dixon found the race tied, 46 percent to 46 percent. Bevin, who has refused to concede defeat and called for a recanvassing of ballots, was trailing by less than a single percentage point Wednesday morning.\par \par \uc2 Trump's campaign manager, \uc2 Brad Parscale\uc2 , dismissed the journalistic analysis of Bevin's Democratic rival, \uc2 Andy Beshear\uc2 , the son of a former governor who declared victory, as "full of crap."\par \par \uc2 "The Democrats nominated a moderate, who's dad was a moderate, who didn't talk about impeachment or Trump, and who acts like a Republican," Parscale wrote. "Talk about Kentucky when an actual Democrat runs."\par \par \uc2 But county-level results in the state showed that regardless of Beshear's strengths and Bevin's weakness, suburban areas, particularly outside of Cincinnati, underperformed historical trends for Republicans.\par \par \uc2 The same shift was also evident in Mississippi, where Republican \uc2 Tate Reeves\uc2  easily won the governorship. Outside Memphis, Reeves carried 61 percent of the vote, compared with four years ago when the Republican candidate for governor won 80 percent of the vote, according to an analysis by Inside Elections. In Madison County, Miss., which includes tony suburbs of Jackson, the Republican vote margin in the gubernatorial race fell from 69 percent to 49 percent.\par \par \uc2 The same problems continue to roil Republican politics in other states. Texas House Speaker Dennis Bonnen (R) recently announced he would step aside after he was caught on tape admitting to concerns about Trump's weakness. "With all due respect to Trump, who I love by the way - he's killing us in the urban-suburban districts," Bonnen said in the recording, according to a transcript.\par \par \uc2 Trump's campaign hopes those shifts will not prove decisive in 2020, when Trump's reelection will depend on his success in swing states such as Wisconsin, Michigan, Florida and Pennsylvania, where there are large rural and non-college-educated populations to offset suburban voters.\par \par \uc2 Republicans also are hoping for help in 2020 from the Democratic nominee for president, given the liberal tilt of high-polling candidates such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and \uc2 Sen. Bernie Sanders\uc2  (I-Vt.), who are calling for a Medicare-for-all plan that would replace the current health insurance system.\par \par \uc2 "We need good candidates who run good campaigns who can speak to college-educated voters," said Corry Bliss, a Republican strategist, who ran a super PAC for House candidates in 2018. "Thankfully for us, the only other party in American politics is the Democratic Party, and their front-runner just released a proposal that will cost $30 trillion and eliminate private health insurance."\par \par \uc2 A Washington Post-ABC News poll released last week found sharp differences in views of Trump between college-educated voters and those who did not get a college degree. About 6 in 10 college graduates strongly disapprove of Trump's job performance, compared with 42 percent of those without college degrees.\par \par \uc2 The divide is also sharp when it comes to the underlying facts driving the impeachment investigation now targeting Trump. While 64 percent of college graduates said Trump had done something wrong in his dealings with Ukraine, half of those without degrees said the same thing, according to the poll.\par \par \uc2 Of next year's likely swing states, Pennsylvania may provide the most significant challenge to Trump, given the large suburban voting pools within commuting distance of Philadelphia and Pittsburgh.\par \par \uc2 "GOP should be most concerned about what happened in local elections in Chester, Delaware and Bucks County, PA," tweeted Josh Holmes, a confidant of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). "That is genuinely alarming if you know the voting history."\par \par \uc2 Trump's campaign and White House staff have launched fitful efforts to reach out to suburban voters around issues including prescription drugs, student loans and teenage e-cigarette usage. They also hope to drive turnout among more rural parts of the state.\par \par \uc2 "Trump's base is rural and small-town Pennsylvania, white working-class voters whose ancestors worked in the mines and in the mills," said G. Terry Madonna, a political science professor at Franklin and Marshall College. "The real fear that the Republicans have is that if the suburbs are the most populous areas and if this trend continues, the problems could worsen."\par \par \uc2 Democratic strategists, as they did in 2018, coached candidates to focus on messages about health care and other pocketbook matters, with issues such as Medicaid expansion bolstering Beshear in Kentucky and playing a central role in Democratic victories in Virginia.\par \par \uc2 robert.costa@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 michael.scherer@washpost.com \par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com\par \par \uc2 WP20191107electionsuburbs\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020191107efb70003m\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Georgia Clark, a veteran high school English teacher in Fort Worth, had an urgent request for President Trump: She needed help pulling undocumented immigrants from her school.\par \par \uc2 "Mr. President, Fort Worth Independent School District is loaded with illegal students from Mexico," Clark wrote May 17 on her now-deleted \uc2 Twitter\uc2  account, @Rebecca1939, in tweets that led to her termination.\par \par \uc2 "Anything you can do to remove the illegals from Fort Worth would be greatly appreciated," she wrote in another tweet.\par \par \uc2 Clark was careful in her approach, she believed, and told the president she needed guarantees her identity would be protected when action was taken. "Texas will not protect whistle blowers. The Mexicans refuse to honor our flag," she wrote.\par \par \uc2 Clark says she didn't mean for everyone to see her thoughts and requests on immigration. She says she believed the tweets were private between her and the president.\par \par \uc2 "Ms. Clark stated she did not realize the tweets were public," the Fort Worth Independent School District said in a review, a copy of which was obtained by The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2 . Clark acknowledged that the tweets were hers, the review said.\par \par \uc2 The very public messages have now embroiled her school district in scandal \u8212\'20\'14 and less than three weeks after she authored them, they got her fired.\par \par \uc2 But Clark "intends to request a hearing for the purpose of contesting the proposed action against her contract," her attorney Brandon Brim said Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 At a Tuesday meeting, eight school board members voted unanimously to terminate Clark's contract after more than a dozen people spoke out against her during public comments.\par \par \uc2 No one spoke in her defense.\par \par \uc2 "Her comments were hurtful, irresponsible, misleading and distrustful to the students she is supposed to protect and educate," one woman told the board. Speaking after the decision, District Superintendent \uc2 Kent P. Scribner\uc2  said Clark's conduct "warranted our recommendation for termination."\par \par \uc2 The inquiry substantiated "inappropriate behavior" in violation of district regulations. Clark was placed on administrative leave with pay on May 29, two days before the last day of school, district spokesman \uc2 Clint Bond\uc2  said.\par \par \uc2 Clark's tweets angered parents and others, prompting a response from Scribner.\par \par \uc2 "Let me reiterate our commitment that every child in the District is welcome and is to be treated with dignity and respect," Scribner wrote May 29 on \uc2 Facebook\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The response was so strong that the district, in a later post, urged parents and guardians to refrain from harsh language.\par \par \uc2 "I'm very surprised and concerned that this cruel woman has been berating our precious children for years," a woman wrote in response to Scribner. "Where was FWISD???" she asked, referring to the Fort Worth Independent School District.\par \par \uc2 The Supreme Court ruled in Plyler v. Doe that public schools are required to provide schooling for children regardless of their immigration status. Schools cannot ask students about their immigration status or report them or family members to federal immigration authorities.\par \par \uc2 Clark, an English teacher at Carter-Riverside High School, has worked with the district since 1998, the review said, and has a history of violations \u8212\'20\'14 including insulting her students' ethnicity. Even before the tweets came to light, the district was already investigating separate allegations of derogatory remarks by Clark in the classroom.\par \par \uc2 Last month, when one student asked to go to the bathroom, Clark told the student to "show me your papers that are saying you are legal," a student told investigators in an account corroborated by another student.\par \par \uc2 She denied to investigators that she made the comment, which the report claims occurred May 17 \u8212\'20\'14 the same day Clark tweeted at Trump multiple times about what she perceived as illegal immigration in Fort Worth and in the school district.\par \par \uc2 Fort Worth's population is about a third Hispanic, according to city data.\par \par \uc2 In 2007, Clark kicked a student, the review said, though an investigation determined it was "without malice." In 2013, she was disciplined for referring to a group of students as "little Mexico" and called another student "white bread." Those allegations proved to be true, according to the review.\par \par \uc2 Julio Argueta, a graduate of a Fort Worth high school and student at nearby \uc2 Texas Christian University\uc2 , told the board he was an immigrant student and said Clark's behavior could have severe and lasting impacts.\par \par \uc2 "Why did we wait until now?" Argueta asked the board, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported. "We need to fire this teacher, and we need to prevent her from ever teaching again."\par \par \uc2 Clark had some defenders online. Fort Worth Republican Women, a \uc2 Facebook\uc2  group, asked members to contact district officials to counter what they view as overreach.\par \par \uc2 "The students were offended by a teacher asking the President, \uc2 Donald J. Trump\uc2 , to enforce the law so she's disciplined?" the group wrote. "Would the same be true if another teacher supported illegal immigration? FWISD has its priorities confused."\par \par \uc2 Clark's former \uc2 Twitter\uc2  account was filled with messages directed to Trump in January and May and containing invective about undocumented immigrants, according to the report.\par \par \uc2 "Do you have someone who has looked at the crime statistics across our great nation and documented the number of time an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  has committed an act of robbery or murder on American citizens?" she wrote to Trump.\par \par \uc2 The president has inaccurately linked violence to unlawful immigrants, who commit crimes at lower rates than U.S.-born Americans.\par \par \uc2 But Clark assured Trump that her concerns were legitimate, the tweets show, and on May 17, she left her cellphone number for the White House to call.\par \par \uc2 "Georgia Clark is my real name," she wrote.\par \par \uc2 Reis Thebault contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 Read more:\par \par \uc2 A Muslim school board candidate was pepper-sprayed during a traffic stop. She decried it as police brutality. Police say she resisted arrest.\par \par \uc2 Useful or foolhardy?

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 THE PROGNOSIS\par \par \uc2 In an address scheduled shortly before noon today, President Trump will call on Congress to pass legislation protecting Americans from the all-too-common problem of surprise medical bills, incurred after a patient receives care from a doctor who is outside his or her health plan's network.\par \par \uc2 The president \u8212\'20\'14 who in January directed Health and Human Services Secretary \uc2 Alex Azar\uc2  and Labor Secretary \uc2 Alex Acosta\uc2  to pursue a fix \u8212\'20\'14 is expected to lay out principles he wants upheld in any legislation on surprise billing Congress might consider, lobbyists and advocates confirmed to The Health 202.\par \par \uc2 Trump's remarks come as a bipartisan group of six senators work to finalize a bill outlining how insurers and doctors should go about settling billing disputes resulting from out-of-network care. That effort is being led by \uc2 Sen. Bill Cassidy\uc2  (R-La.) and by \uc2 Sen. Maggie Hassan\uc2  (D-N.H.), whose offices confirmed they\u160\'00\'A0will attend today's address at the White House. The group is expected to roll out legislation by the end of May.\par \par \uc2 Lawmakers aren't targeting\u160\'00\'A0just any medical bills that catch people unaware. They are seeking to curtail medical bills widely\u160\'00\'A0regarded as truly unfair because patients couldn't avoid them despite their best efforts.\par \par \uc2 Even when patients carefully select a hospital in their network, they may still end up receiving care during\u160\'00\'A0a hospital\u160\'00\'A0stay from a radiologist, anesthesiologist or pathologist who isn't part of their insurance's coverage network. As a result, they'll receive higher bills reflecting out-of-network rates \u8212\'20\'14 charges that can amount to thousands or even tens of thousands of dollars.\par \par \uc2 "The pricing is hurting patients, and we've stopped a lot of it, but we're going to stop all of it," Trump said during a January roundtable on the subject.\par \par \uc2 Joe Grogan, director of the White House Domestic Policy Council, told hospitals in March they had better address the problem or else expect action from policymakers and lawmakers.\par \par \uc2 "If hospitals, providers and issuers don't protect these patients from financial harm, Congress and the administration will need to act," Grogan said at the \uc2 Federation of American Hospitals\uc2 ' annual conference.\par \par \uc2 Insurers, doctors and hospitals all publicly say they agree that patients should be protected from these kinds of charges. But the effort sets up a potential fight among different stakeholders, as they each try to duck the extra costs that would be shifted away from patients.\par \par \uc2 Both providers and insurers agree there should be a process to determine payment rates. The goal here is to bridge the gap between the charge from a hospital or doctor and what insurers say they're willing to pay for out-of-network care. But there are a few different ways to get there.\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 Several previous bills have proposed an arbitration process, where an impartial arbiter examines the figures presented by each side and selects one as the final payment. Proponents of this approach point to New York's baseball-style arbitration process in place\u160\'00\'A0since 2015, which has prompted a major decline in out-of-network medical bills in the state.\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 Another approach is to set a fixed standard\u160\'00\'A0in which out-of-network care would be reimbursed at a rate such as 125 percent of Medicare rates, or the 80th percentile of rates paid by commercial plans.\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 Some economists have also suggested\u160\'00\'A0that bundling payments for hospitals and their on-site doctors could help solve the problem.\par \par \uc2 The trick with all these possible approaches is to make sure the payments aren't set too high,\u160\'00\'A0which could incentivize doctors to leave a hospital's network,\u160\'00\'A0nor too low,\u160\'00\'A0to ensure providers still get adequately compensated and that insurers don't gain too much leverage.\par \par \uc2 America's Health Insurance Plans\uc2 , the major health insurers association, favors a set payment method, warning that an arbitration process could lead to higher premiums. Doctors appear favorably inclined\u160\'00\'A0to both methods, but they've stress\u160\'00\'A0that insurers should be required to contract with a sufficient number of doctors and specialists \u8212\'20\'14 a further way to shield patients from encountering an out-of-network physician during a hospital stay.\par \par \uc2 "Overly narrow provider networks \u8212\'20\'14 particularly those that lack sufficient numbers of specialists \u8212\'20\'14 are a major factor in unanticipated billing," \uc2 Barbara McAneny\uc2 , president of the American Medical Association, wrote in an op-ed published Tuesday by the Hill.\par \par \uc2 AHH, OOF and OUCH AHH: Drugmakers will be required to display the list price of medications in television advertisements, according to a rule finalized yesterday by \uc2 HHS\uc2 . The\u160\'00\'A0advertisements must also display the sentence "If you have health insurance that covers drugs, your cost may be different," as an acknowledgment that list prices are usually much\u160\'00\'A0higher than what insured consumers must pay out-of-pocket for their medications. It will apply to medicines that cost more than $35 for a month supply.\par \par \uc2 The regulation, which the pharmaceutical industry decried yesterday, is among a basket of steps the Trump administration is taking to improve transparency in the drug pricing system and put pressure on drugmakers to ease their prices.\par \par \uc2 "Requiring drug companies\u160\'00\'A0to level with American patients\u160\'00\'A0about their prices is about working toward a system where the patient \u8212\'20\'14 not the insurer, not the drug company, not the government but the patient\u160\'00\'A0\u8212\'20\'14 is the one in control of her health care," Azar told reporters.\par \par \uc2 OOF: Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said she would donate the $4,500 in campaign contributions she has previously accepted from the prominent Sackler family, which owns one of the country's top opioid manufacturers, \uc2 Purdue Pharma\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 In a Medium post announcing a plan to use $100 billion in federal funding to address the opioid epidemic, Warren criticized the family and its\u160\'00\'A0role in the crisis.\par \par \uc2 "The opioid epidemic teaches us that too often in America today, if you have money and power, you can take advantage of everyone else without consequence. I think it's time to change that," she wrote. "That's the America we deserve \u8230\'20\'26 An America where, when people like the Sacklers destroy millions of lives to make money, they don't get museum wings named after them, they go to jail."\par \par \uc2 It's not clear to what groups Warren will donate the funds, the Wall Street Journal's\u160\'00\'A0Joshua Jamerson reports, adding the Massachusetts Democrat has received money from numerous members of the family going back to 2012.\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 Warren's $100 billion plan to tackle the opioid epidemic is also an "eye-catching amount that reflects a broader strategy by Democrats to focus on issues important to President Trump's base where they say he has fallen short," our Post colleagues Annie Linskey and Katie Zezima report.\par \par \uc2 Yesterday the Trump administration\u160\'00\'A0released a report\u160\'00\'A0listing action it has\u160\'00\'A0taken to address the opioid crisis, including securing $6 billion in funding from Congress, upping the number of prosecutions of fentanyl traffickers and increasing the availability of medication-assisted treatments and overdose-reversing medication. James Carroll, director of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, claimed\u160\'00\'A0"significant progress" in combating the epidemic.\par \par \uc2 "The spotlight thrown on the topic by leaders of both parties shows the potency of addiction as a political issue and the continued impact of an overdose crisis that resulted in roughly 70,000 deaths in 2017, most of them from opioids," Annie and Katie write.\par \par \uc2 But in an interview, Warren insisted Trump "has been all talk and no action" and dismissed a question about whether the Trump administration has increased attention on opioids. "It doesn't matter if you don't back it up with real resources and help for the people who need it," Warren said. "He hasn't made it a priority."\par \par \uc2 OUCH: People living in rural areas are increasingly responsible for the rise in global obesity rates. Our\u160\'00\'A0Post colleague William Wan reports a consortium of researchers found in the past three decades, the global rise in obesity has mostly been propelled by unhealthy weight gain in rural pockets, rather than in urban areas.\par \par \uc2 "The study \u8212\'20\'14 a massive collaboration by more than 1,000 researchers, drawing on more than 2,000 studies of 200 countries \u8212\'20\'14 found that more than 55 percent of the global increase in body mass index in the past 30 years has come from rural populations," he reports. "The trend was even sharper in low- and middle-income countries, with more than 80 percent of the worsening BMI driven by rural populations."\par \par \uc2 Barry M. Popkin, a University of North Carolina food science researcher who was not involved in the new study, told William: "It means we need to think of policies that address rural areas or have an effect in rural and urban areas equally. We can't just ignore it anymore."\par \par \uc2 AGENCY ALERT \u8212\'20\'14 Robert Pear, a 40-year veteran of the New York Times and relentless health-care reporter, died this week at age 69. He was, as our Post colleague Emily Langer writes, "one of the most relentlessly probing journalists on the health-care beat, enlightening readers and rankling partisans with the clarity of his reportage and his savantlike understanding of the federal government and its arcana. With a seemingly ever-present byline on Page One of the Times, Mr. Pear was a constant and authoritative presence in Washington for four decades."\par \par \uc2 As the \uc2 New York Times\uc2 's Sam Roberts writes, Pear tenaciously pursued scoop after scoop, and in the course of more than 6,700 Times articles "went about his reporting meticulously and, to the wider public, inconspicuously." In his memory, the \uc2 New York Times\uc2  is retiring the slug "HEALTH," because as editors said: "it can only be by Pear."\par \par \uc2 Many in the health-care industry, fellow reporters and lawmakers reacted to\u160\'00\'A0Pear's death, including Senate Minority Leader \uc2 Chuck Schumer\uc2  (D-N.Y.):\par \par \uc2 From the Times's\u160\'00\'A0Maggie Astor:\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Soon-to-be-Times reporter \uc2 Sarah Kliff\uc2 :\par \par \uc2 Andy Slavitt, who headed CMS under President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 :\par \par \uc2 HEALTH ON THE HILL \u8212\'20\'14 Democrats on the \uc2 House Appropriations Committee\uc2  batted down a Republican effort to block funding to entities that provide abortions unless certain requirements were met related to babies born alive after attempted abortions, as our Post colleague Erica Werner reports.\par \par \uc2 The 23-29 defeat of the amendment by \uc2 Rep. Tom Cole\uc2  (R-Okla.) followed impassioned remarks from \uc2 Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler\uc2  (R-Wash.) in support of the measure. She detailed how multiple health-care providers told her to end her pregnancy with her first child, now 6 years-old, who was born without her kidneys. Her first daughter, Abigail, is now doing well and \uc2 Herrera Beutler\uc2  is expecting her third child this month.\par \par \uc2 "I just think how many other instances are there?" the Washington Republican told the committee. "Most of these are moms who want these babies.

Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.)\u160\'00\'A0dismissed the Republican effort as a "ruse to ban safe and legal abortion in the United States."\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 Later in the day, the \uc2 House Appropriations Committee\uc2  also voted to block a new Trump administration rule aimed at\u160\'00\'A0protecting health-care providers, insurers and employers who object to providing or paying for services like abortion that violate religious beliefs.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 "The measure by Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) would prevent spending to implement the new rule, which Trump announced last week during a speech before faith leaders," Erica writes. Lee's amendment passed on a 30-23 vote along party lines.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 "This dangerous and discriminatory rule attempts to enshrine discrimination in virtually all facets of health care by granting new rights to those who believe their personal beliefs should determine the care a patient receives," Lee said. Meanwhile, Republicans called Lee's measure a "poison pill" that would hinder passage of the broader spending bill being debated.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 And the full Democrat-led House plans to vote today on a bill\u160\'00\'A0blocking \uc2 HHS\uc2  from granting states Affordable Care Act waivers that could make way for some health plans with fewer protections\u160\'00\'A0for individuals with preexisting conditions. The White House threatened to veto it.\par \par \uc2 In a policy statement\u160\'00\'A0threatening a veto, the White House suggested the bill's title \u8212\'20\'14 the Protecting Americans with Preexisting Conditions Act of 2019 \u8212\'20\'14 was "misleading." "This bill would not extend any additional protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Rather, it would harm the ability of States to improve coverage for people both with and without pre-existing conditions," the statement read.\par \par \uc2 In response, Protect Our Care chair \uc2 Leslie Dach\uc2  also pointed to Republican efforts to undermine the health-care law and its protections for people with preexisting conditions, including a GOP-backed lawsuit aiming to invalidate the ACA: "[T]he record shows they'll do everything they can to let insurance companies gut coverage for patients with pre-existing conditions."\par \par \uc2 From House Speaker \uc2 Nancy Pelosi\uc2  (D-Calif.):\par \par \uc2 Sen.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 House Democrats exploded in recriminations Thursday over moderates bucking the party, with liberal Rep. AlexandriaOcasio-Cortez threatening to put those voting with Republicans "on a list" for a primary challenge.\par \par \uc2 In a closed-door session, a frustrated Speaker \uc2 Nancy Pelosi\uc2  (D-Calif.) lashed out at about two dozen moderates and pressured them to get on board. "We are either a team or we're not, and we have to make that decision," Pelosi said, according to two people present but not authorized to discuss the remarks publicly.\par \par \uc2 But Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), the unquestioned media superstar of the freshman class, upped the ante, admonishing the moderates and indicating she would help liberal activists unseat them in the 2020 election.\par \par \uc2 Corbin Trent, a spokesman for Ocasio-Cortez, said she told her colleagues that Democrats who side with Republicans "are putting themselves on a list."\par \par \uc2 "She said that when activists ask her why she had to vote for a gun safety bill that also further empowers an agency that forcibly injects kids with psychotropic drugs, they're going to want a list of names and she's going to give it to them," Trent said, referring to \uc2 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Ocasio-Cortez on Friday disputed that she had directly threatened her colleagues, saying in a tweet that Democrats were "inadvertently making a list of targets for the GOP and for progressive advocates" by voting with Republicans.\par \par \uc2 Triggering the blowup was Wednesday's votes on a bill to expand federal background checks for gun purchases.Twenty-six moderate Democrats joined Republicans in amending the legislation, adding a provision requiring that ICE be notified if an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  seeks to purchase a gun.\par \par \uc2 That infuriated liberals who have railed against ICE's role in conducting mass deportations and embarrassed Democratic leaders who couldn't keep their members in line on a high-profile bill.\par \par \uc2 The Democratic infighting reflects a fractured caucus and diverse freshman class, with dozens of moderates elected in districts that President Trump won in 2016 at odds with hard-charging liberals. The split has exposed divisions among Pelosi and her top lieutenants, Majority Leader \uc2 Steny H. Hoyer\uc2  (Md.) and Majority Whip James E. Clyburn (S.C.), over the party strategy to keep its newfound majority.\par \par \uc2 Republicans have capitalized on the divide, using legislative tactics to split politically vulnerable moderates from the party leadership. In the coming months, votes on health care, the environment and spending bills could cause more extreme breaks in the Democratic ranks.\par \par \uc2 While the party's left wing has gotten outsize attention for its aggressive moves to push Democrats in their direction, the splinter faction is made up of the party's moderates \u8212\'20\'14 many of them freshmen taking their first congressional votes.\par \par \uc2 They insist they are not going to be dissuaded from voting with their districts, and many are warning that majority control is at stake.\par \par \uc2 "It's this class of members that got elected that are the reason we have the majority," said Rep. Stephanie Murphy (D-Fla.), a co-chairman of the moderate Blue Dog Coalition. "Many of them come from these [moderate] districts, and their promise to their constituents was that they were going to put people over politics."\par \par \uc2 Inside the Democratic meeting, one of those freshmen \u8212\'20\'14 Rep. Xochitl Torres Small (N.M.) \u8212\'20\'14 reacted sharply to Ocasio-Cortez's comments and rose to urge her colleagues to respect the political reality of representing a swing district, according to multiple people present. A spokesman for Torres Small did not respond to a request for comment.\par \par \uc2 Several are also pushing to reform or eliminate the procedural tactic that has prompted the uproar \u8212\'20\'14 the "motion to recommit," which essentially gives the minority party one final opportunity to amend a bill moments before it comes up for a final vote.\par \par \uc2 Pelosi trained much of her closed-door frustrations on veteran lawmakers, noting that some held seats on coveted committees. "What is this?" she asked, according to the aides.\par \par \uc2 Later, when one lawmaker talked about the peril of persistently voting with party leaders on these motions, Pelosi responded that the party stood ready to help team players: "We have a massive MASH operation and, frankly, it should be there for those who have the courage to take the vote."\par \par \uc2 Publicly and privately, Pelosi has urged members to treat the Republican motions as procedural feints that should be routinely ignored. "Vote no \u8212\'20\'14 just vote no," she told reporters Thursday, "because the fact is, a vote yes is to give leverage to the other side." But Hoyer and Clyburn believe that is untenable when Republicans stand ready to use those votes as political cudgels against vulnerable Democrats.\par \par \uc2 Republicans, during their past eight-year majority, maintained remarkable discipline on these procedural votes. Democrats did not manage to pass a single one from 2011 through 2018. But Democrats have already lost two this year, and during their previous majority from 2007 through 2010, they lost roughly one in every five.\par \par \uc2 "The fact of the matter is, it didn't affect our ability to pass substantive legislation that was very positive and had a positive effect on the American people," Hoyer said, recalling the last Democratic majority and playing down the importance of those votes.\par \par \uc2 But others say routine Democratic defections threaten to have more serious consequences when the party considers more sensitive bills \u8212\'20\'14 and perhaps has a Democratic Senate and president to pass them into law. Already some said they are fretting about the possibility of more Republican mischief.\par \par \uc2 "People need to be aware that coming down the road will be 'gotcha' amendments that actually gut the bill, and if we want to be able to move legislation forward, we're going to have to figure out a way to deal with it," said \uc2 House Rules Committee\uc2  Chairman \uc2 Jim McGovern\uc2  (D-Mass.).\par \par \uc2 The philosophical differences between the three leaders have frustrated some incoming freshmen, who are already bewildered by the practice of voting on the surprise Republican amendments. Members typically have only a few minutes' notice before having to cast votes on motions that, in recent practice, are crafted to be as politically uncomfortable as possible for the majority party.\par \par \uc2 "We hear lots of different things from lots of different members of our leadership about their views on this issue, and they should get together and figure it out," said Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.).\par \par \uc2 A few Democrats said Thursday that the motion to recommit should be jettisoned entirely. "It's archaic, it's ridiculous, and it only shows our stupidity that we still have it," Rep. Juan Vargas (D-Calif.) said.\par \par \uc2 But others in party leadership were more wary of eroding one of the few tools handed to the minority in an institution where the majority typically enjoys absolute power. "What goes around comes around \u8212\'20\'14 you have to keep that in mind," McGovern said.\par \par \uc2 Hoyer has offered support for changing the procedure surrounding motions to recommit, giving members more time to review the minority amendment. But Democratic leaders have made no final decision about whether to pursue that, and lawmakers left Washington on Thursday saying only that there would be further conversations about it.\par \par \uc2 Republican leaders, meanwhile, warned against any changes. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) told reporters Thursday that changes "would be a nuclear option" and "would leave a stain on this majority just two months in."\par \par \uc2 "Never once did we discuss, did we bring up the option or even entertain the idea," McCarthy said about the GOP's past majority. "Less than 60 days into a majority, they want to silence a minority? That is wrong."\par \par \uc2 mike.debonis@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020190301ef31000gp\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved \par \par \uc2 House Democrats exploded in recriminations Thursday over moderates bucking the party, with liberal Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez threatening to put those voting with Republicans "on a list" for a primary challenge.\par \par \uc2 In a closed-door session, a frustrated Speaker \uc2 Nancy Pelosi\uc2  (D-Calif.) lashed out at about two dozen moderates and pressured them to get on board. "We are either a team or we're not, and we have to make that decision," Pelosi said, according to two people present but not authorized to discuss the remarks publicly.\par \par \uc2 But Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), the unquestioned media superstar of the freshman class, upped the ante, admonishing the moderates and indicating she would help liberal activists unseat them in the 2020 election.\par \par \uc2 Corbin Trent, a spokesman for Ocasio-Cortez, said she told her colleagues that Democrats who side with Republicans "are putting themselves on a list."\par \par \uc2 "She said that when activists ask her why she had to vote for a gun safety bill that also further empowers an agency that forcibly injects kids with psychotropic drugs, they're going to want a list of names and she's going to give it to them," Trent said, referring to \uc2 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Triggering the blowup was Wednesday's votes on a bill to expand federal background checks for gun purchases. Twenty-six moderate Democrats joined Republicans in amending the legislation, adding a provision requiring that ICE be notified if an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  seeks to purchase a gun.\par \par \uc2 That infuriated liberals who have railed against ICE's role in conducting mass deportations and embarrassed Democratic leaders who couldn't keep their members in line on a high-profile bill.\par \par \uc2 The Democratic infighting reflects a fractured caucus and diverse freshman class, with dozens of moderates elected in districts that President Trump won in 2016 at odds with hard-charging liberals. The split has exposed divisions among Pelosi and her top lieutenants, Majority Leader \uc2 Steny H. Hoyer\uc2  (Md.) and Majority Whip James E. Clyburn (S.C.), over the party strategy to keep its newfound majority.\par \par \uc2 Republicans have capitalized on the divide, using legislative tactics to split politically vulnerable moderates from the party leadership. In the coming months, votes on health care, the environment and spending bills could cause more extreme breaks in the Democratic ranks.\par \par \uc2 While the party's left wing has gotten outsize attention for its aggressive moves to push Democrats in their direction, the splinter faction is made up of the party's moderates - many of them freshmen taking their first congressional votes.\par \par \uc2 They insist they are not going to be dissuaded from voting with their districts, and many are warning that majority control is at stake.\par \par \uc2 "It's this class of members that got elected that are the reason we have the majority," said Rep. Stephanie Murphy (D-Fla.), a co-chairman of the moderate Blue Dog Coalition. "Many of them come from these [moderate] districts, and their promise to their constituents was that they were going to put people over politics."\par \par \uc2 Inside the Democratic meeting, one of those freshmen - Rep. Xochitl Torres Small (N.M.) - reacted sharply to Ocasio- Cortez's comments and rose to urge her colleagues to respect the political reality of representing a swing district, according to multiple people present. A spokesman for Torres Small did not respond to a request for comment.\par \par \uc2 Several are also pushing to reform or eliminate the procedural tactic that has prompted the uproar - the "motion to recommit," which essentially gives the minority party one final opportunity to amend a bill moments before it comes up for a final vote.\par \par \uc2 Pelosi trained much of her closed-door frustrations on veteran lawmakers, noting that some held seats on coveted committees. "What is this?" she asked, according to the aides.\par \par \uc2 Later, when one lawmaker talked about the peril of persistently voting with party leaders on these motions, Pelosi responded that the party stood ready to help team players: "We have a massive MASH operation and, frankly, it should be there for those who have the courage to take the vote."\par \par \uc2 Publicly and privately, Pelosi has urged members to treat the Republican motions as procedural feints that should be routinely ignored. "Vote no - just vote no," she told reporters Thursday, "because the fact is, a vote yes is to give leverage to the other side." But Hoyer and Clyburn believe that is untenable when Republicans stand ready to use those votes as political cudgels against vulnerable Democrats.\par \par \uc2 Republicans, during their past eight-year majority, maintained remarkable discipline on these procedural votes. Democrats did not manage to pass a single one from 2011 through 2018. But Democrats have already lost two this year, and during their previous majority from 2007 through 2010, they lost roughly one in every five.\par \par \uc2 "The fact of the matter is, it didn't affect our ability to pass substantive legislation that was very positive and had a positive effect on the American people," Hoyer said, recalling the last Democratic majority and playing down the importance of those votes.\par \par \uc2 But others say routine Democratic defections threaten to have more serious consequences when the party considers more sensitive bills - and perhaps has a Democratic Senate and president to pass them into law. Already some said they are fretting about the possibility of more Republican mischief.\par \par \uc2 "People need to be aware that coming down the road will be 'gotcha' amendments that actually gut the bill, and if we want to be able to move legislation forward, we're going to have to figure out a way to deal with it," said \uc2 House Rules Committee\uc2  Chairman \uc2 Jim McGovern\uc2  (D-Mass.).\par \par \uc2 The philosophical differences between the three leaders have frustrated some incoming freshmen, who are already bewildered by the practice of voting on the surprise Republican amendments. Members typically have only a few minutes' notice before having to cast votes on motions that, in recent practice, are crafted to be as politically uncomfortable as possible for the majority party.\par \par \uc2 "We hear lots of different things from lots of different members of our leadership about their views on this issue, and they should get together and figure it out," said Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.).\par \par \uc2 A few Democrats said Thursday that the motion to recommit should be jettisoned entirely. "It's archaic, it's ridiculous, and it only shows our stupidity that we still have it," Rep. Juan Vargas (D- Calif.) said.\par \par \uc2 But others in party leadership were more wary of eroding one of the few tools handed to the minority in an institution where the majority typically enjoys absolute power. "What goes around comes around - you have to keep that in mind," McGovern said.\par \par \uc2 Hoyer has offered support for changing the procedure surrounding motions to recommit, giving members more time to review the minority amendment. But Democratic leaders have made no final decision about whether to pursue that, and lawmakers left Washington on Thursday saying only that there would be further conversations about it.\par \par \uc2 Republican leaders, meanwhile, warned against any changes. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) told reporters Thursday that changes "would be a nuclear option" and "would leave a stain on this majority just two months in."\par \par \uc2 "Never once did we discuss, did we bring up the option or even entertain the idea," McCarthy said about the GOP's past majority. "Less than 60 days into a majority, they want to silence a minority? That is wrong."\par \par \uc2 mike.debonis@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com\par \par \uc2 WP20190301houseedems0301\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020190301ef310002f\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 THE PROGNOSIS\par \par \uc2 The silence from some progressive activists and lawmakers as House progressives unfurled an expansive new Medicare-for-all bill was perhaps more telling than the applause it received.\par \par \uc2 Don't get us wrong \u8212\'20\'14 there's undoubtedly\u160\'00\'A0fresh, unprecedented energy behind what was once regarded as a liberal fringe idea of replacing the country's largely privately run health-insurance system with a single\u160\'00\'A0government-run plan. \uc2 Rep. Pramila Jayapal\uc2  (D-Wash.) touted support from 107 House co-sponsors as she rolled out her bill outside the U.S. Capitol, promising it would fix a host of ills by providing all Americans with a broad array of benefits.\par \par \uc2 "We have a bill, and it is a real plan," Jayapal said\u160\'00\'A0to cheers from onlookers. "First of all, we cover everyone, not just children, not just seniors, not just those who are healthy \u8230\'20\'26everyone, because health care is a human right."\par \par \uc2 But Democrats' internal disputes starting poking through the debate over how to expand health coverage to more people, if you read between the lines. Key players whose support would be vital to the success of Jayapal's bill were muted, while a group of moderate House Democrats called for instead improving the Affordable Care Act and expanding existing\u160\'00\'A0private channels of health coverage.\par \par \uc2 A spokesman for House Speaker \uc2 Nancy Pelosi\uc2  (D-Calif.) didn't respond to a question about whether she would bring the bill to the floor. Influential groups on the political left,\u160\'00\'A0including the \uc2 Center for American Progress\uc2 , AARP and\u160\'00\'A0Protect Our Care,\u160\'00\'A0declined requests for comment about Jayapal's bill.\par \par \uc2 And a group of 101 centrist Democrats\u160\'00\'A0dubbed the New Democrats\u160\'00\'A0asked House leaders in a letter sent Wednesday to focus on improving the ACA marketplaces by reinstating extra subsidies for out-of-pocket costs, providing reinsurance dollars to help insurers with the sickest patients and letting states auto-enroll patients in the individual marketplaces. Those ideas stand a chance of some Republican buy-in, in contrast to Jayapal's proposal.\par \par \uc2 "We think we can drive the caucus agenda because we are open to working with Republicans," Rep. Ami Bera (D-Calif.) told reporters. "There is an urgency to addressing this issue."\par \par \uc2 Jayapal's bill has yet to gain as much support as the Medicare-for-all bill proposed in the last Congress, which had 124 co-sponsors. Twenty-six Democrats who signed on to that shorter, vaguer measure from then-\uc2 Rep. John Conyers\uc2  (D-Mich.) haven't yet thrown their backing behind Jayapal's more specific and extensive legislation. They include Rep. Ann Eshoo\u160\'00\'A0(Calif.), the top Democrat on the Energy and Commerce Health subcommittee, along with House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn (S.C.) and Budget Committee Chairman \uc2 John Yarmuth\uc2  (Ky.).\par \par \uc2 Jayapal did pick up 17 new co-sponsors for her bill from among the 64 House Democratic freshman. But just seven of the 42 Democrats who flipped Republican seats in the midterm elections \u8212\'20\'14 Reps. Ann Kirkpatrick of Arizona, Jared Golden of Maine, Susan Wild of Pennsylvania, and California's \uc2 Josh Harder\uc2 , Katie Hill, \uc2 Katie Porter\uc2  and Mike Levin \u8212\'20\'14 are co-sponsors of the Jayapal bill.\par \par \uc2 Jayapal delayed introducing her bill for two weeks as she worked to get more co-sponsors. But yesterday, she appeared buoyant over the support it has received so far and predicted she'll keep making inroads among her House colleagues.\par \par \uc2 "I am confident we will just continue to increase that number," she said.\par \par \uc2 The Hill's Peter Sullivan:\par \par \uc2 Reporter Matt Laslo:\par \par \uc2 Ryan Grim, D.C.\u160\'00\'A0bureau chief for the Intercept:\par \par \uc2 The Washington Democrat's bill incorporates key policy demands of single-payer activists, aiming to overhaul the country's health-care system even faster and more dramatically than the first Medicare-for-all bill proposed a year and a half ago by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), my \uc2 Washington Post\uc2  colleague Jeff Stein notes\u160\'00\'A0in a piece explaining the measure.\par \par \uc2 "Jayapal's Medicare-for-all would move every American onto one government insurer in two years, while providing everyone with medical, vision, dental and long-term care at no cost," Jeff writes. "Similar proposals have been projected to\u160\'00\'A0increase federal expenditures by at least $30 trillion but virtually eradicate individuals' health spending by eliminating payments such as premiums and deductibles."\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Jayapal didn't propose\u160\'00\'A0how to pay for her bill, which includes a massively expensive proposal not even Sanders included in his Medicare-for-all measure: coverage of long-term care to help aging Americans and those with disabilities.\par \par \uc2 "The number of Americans who require long-term care is expected to explode over the next few decades as the baby-boom generation ages, with the number of Americans with a disability projected to more than double from 2015 to 2065," Jeff notes. "Jayapal's new Medicare-for-all bill, unlike the one Sanders introduced in the Senate in 2017, would guarantee free long-term care, including home health care, for Americans with disabilities as part of the single-payer system."\par \par \uc2 That provision \u8212\'20\'14\u160\'00\'A0combined with several other elements in Jayapal's plan such as the promise of zero co-payments for health services \u8212\'20\'14\u160\'00\'A0raises challenging questions about how the government could manage to pay for such a generous measure.\par \par \uc2 It's an argument Republicans, industry heads and other opponents of Medicare-for-all will keep hitting over and over again.\par \par \uc2 "I look forward to hearing from the members \u8230\'20\'26 about how they plan to pay for a $32 trillion proposal," said \uc2 Rep. Steve Womack\uc2  (Ark.), the ranking Republican on\u160\'00\'A0the House Budget Committee, which is expected to hold a hearing this spring on the impact of Medicare-for-all measures.\par \par \uc2 Womack isn't referencing an official cost estimate. The Congressional Budget Offfice is expected to review and estimate the price tag of a number of Medicare-for-all proposals.\par \par \uc2 AHH, OOF and OUCH AHH: House Democrats and gun-control advocates celebrated the passage of a bill expanding federal background checks for firearm purchases and transfers, even with a veto threat from President Trump and little likelihood it will be be considered in the Republican-controlled Senate.\par \par \uc2 The Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019 passed\u160\'00\'A0240 to 190\u160\'00\'A0with mostly Democratic votes, our Post colleague Mike DeBonis reports, adding it is the "first major new firearm restrictions to advance in a generation."\par \par \uc2 The bill amends federal gun laws to mandate background checks for all gun sales and most gun transfers, requiring federally licensed dealers to run background checks on buyers. Private sellers who are not federally licensed would not be required to do so.\par \par \uc2 "In an embarrassment for Democratic leaders, Republicans successfully used a floor maneuver to amend the bill \u8212\'20\'14 requiring the notification of \uc2 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2  if an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  seeks to buy a gun," Mike adds. "Twenty-six Democrats joined Republicans to support the amendment."\par \par \uc2 But Pelosi\u160\'00\'A0said the move is "not to eclipse a tremendous victory."\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 "We're grateful, again, to the young people, parents, survivors across America who have told their stories, marched for their lives and demanded change," Pelosi said on the House floor. "This bill delivers that change: ensuring that people who are a danger to themselves and others cannot purchase a gun and perpetuate violence in our communities."\par \par \uc2 OOF: A new report from the \uc2 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\uc2  found the decline in HIV infections nationwide has\u160\'00\'A0stalled in recent years.\par \par \uc2 The report comes just weeks after President Trump vowed during his State of the Union address\u160\'00\'A0to end the HIV epidemic within the next decade.\par \par \uc2 "Together, we will defeat aids in America. And beyond," Trump said. \u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 After about five years of marked declines, the number of new infections has remained steady at about 39,000 each year since 2013, the CDC reports.\par \par \uc2 In a news release, CDC Director \uc2 Robert Redfield\uc2  praised the president's plan.\u160\'00\'A0"Now is the time for our Nation to take bold action. We strongly support President Trump's plan to end the HIV epidemic in America," he said. "We must move beyond the status quo to end the HIV epidemic in America."\par \par \uc2 OUCH: In the past year, at least 17 people have been hospitalized after getting injected with products derived from umbilical cord blood, an unproven treatment that's marketed as a miracle cure for various conditions.\u160\'00\'A0Such products, which are not approved by federal regulators or backed by clinical research, are a little-known but growing part of the stem cell industry, our Post colleagues William Wan and Laurie McGinley report\u160\'00\'A0in an extensive look at this\u160\'00\'A0growing trend.\par \par \uc2 After people got sick in five different states, health officials are warning about the risks.\par \par \uc2 "All but two of the illnesses have been linked to a single company: Liveyon of Yorba Linda, Calif," William and Laurie write. "\uc2 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\uc2  issued a report in December tying 12 cases in multiple states to treatments sold by the company. Three additional patients in Texas and Maine have filed lawsuits against Liveyon claiming the company's product infected them with bacteria."\par \par \uc2 The company, which sells vials of a solution it says is derived from umbilical cord blood, issued a recall after the \uc2 Food and Drug Administration\uc2 \u160\'00\'A0and other health officials inquired about infected patients last September. But internal company records show Liveyon received reports of ill patients, and some who tested positive for E. coli, as early as four months before the recall.\par \par \uc2 After the recall, Liveyon executives blamed the\u160\'00\'A0manufacturing company. "We're a victim as much as the patients who were infected," Liveyon's founder and chief executive, John Kosolcharoen, told our colleagues.\par \par \uc2 HEALTH ON THE HILL \u8212\'20\'14 Trump's former fixer and personal lawyer \uc2 Michael Cohen\uc2  testified before the House Oversight Committee yesterday, at one point\u160\'00\'A0explaining\u160\'00\'A0details of his $1.2 million contract with Swiss pharmaceutical giant \uc2 Novartis\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 He told lawmakers the company wanted him to lobby, which he said he refused to do. "\uc2 Novartis\uc2  sent me their contract, which stated specifically that they wanted me to lobby. \u8230\'20\'26 That paragraph was crossed out by me," he said.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 When pressed by \uc2 Rep. Mark Meadows\uc2  (R-N.C.) about Cohen's consulting contracts with various companies, including \uc2 Novartis\uc2 , Cohen insisted it was "not something that's unusual in Washington."\par \par \uc2 "They came to me based on my knowledge of the enigma Donald Trump," Cohen said of \uc2 Novartis\uc2 . He estimated\u160\'00\'A0he spoke to company officials\u160\'00\'A0six times.\par \par \uc2 "Meadows tried to portray the situation as one in which the firm used Cohen as an unregistered lobbyist, a characterization Cohen denied," Stat's Matthew Herper writes. "\uc2 Novartis\uc2 ' relationship with Cohen has become a repeated reputational headache for the drug giant \u8230\'20\'26 Initially, \uc2 Novartis\uc2  said that it had ceased contact with Cohen immediately after having a first meeting in which it became clear that he did not understand health policy well.\u160\'00\'A0 The case cropped up again last July, when a congressional investigation revealed that the contacts between \uc2 Novartis\uc2  and Cohen had been more numerous than had been previously suggested."\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 Meanwhile, the House Energy and Commerce Oversight subcommittee\u160\'00\'A0gathered to discuss the nationwide measles outbreak\u160\'00\'A0in a hearing that at times turned rowdy. Rep. Diana DeGette (D-Colo.) banged her gavel and called twice for order over shouts from anti-vaccination activists in the audience, some dressed in red, who voiced their disagreement with\u160\'00\'A0two experts who testified.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Many of the outbreaks have occurred in close-knit communities with lower vaccination rates, said Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. She said unvaccinated people risk contracting measles while abroad and bringing the disease back home. She emphasized the safety of the vaccine that protects against measles, mumps and rubella, saying the most common side effect is a sore arm.\par \par \uc2 Anthony Fauci\uc2 , director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health, agreed the measles vaccine is highly effective. During his testimony, he also warned social media plays a large role in perpetuating misinformation.\par \par \uc2 "People refer to things that have been proven to be false," he said about the spread of claims that vaccines can cause complications such as autism. "I think that's a major contribution to the problem that we're discussing."\par \par \uc2 Fauci said vaccination levels need to be high\u160\'00\'A0to eradicate measles. He referenced the current outbreak in Madagascar, where vaccination rates are low and measles has caused over 900 deaths since September, according to the \uc2 World Health Organization\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Fauci also warned about the loss of herd immunity\u160\'00\'A0if vaccination rates drop too low, explaining high vaccination levels in a community help protect those who are too young or medically vulnerable to get vaccinated themselves.\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 Ilana Marcus\par \par \uc2 AGENCY ALERT \u8212\'20\'14 FDA\u160\'00\'A0Commissioner \uc2 Scott Gottlieb\uc2  said he would support raising the minimum age to purchase tobacco products from 18 to 21.\par \par \uc2 "We would support that," Gottlieb said during a hearing before the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, \uc2 Food and Drug Administration\uc2 , and Related Agencies. "A lot of the youth access isn't just 14-year-olds and 15-year-olds going into convenience stores and buying these products. This is enterprising 18-year-olds in high school buying them legally, and creating a business in their high school selling them back to 16-year-olds and 15-year-olds."\par \par \uc2 He said raising the purchase age to 21 could help address that\u160\'00\'A0issue and help combat youth tobacco use.\par \par \uc2 Gottlieb was also grilled about youth e-cigarette use. House Appropriations Chair \uc2 Nita Lowey\uc2  (D-N.Y.) pointed fingers at Gottlieb for delaying a regulation that would have removed e-cigarettes from the market this year, a move she said contributed to the booming rate of teen use. "The \uc2 FDA\uc2 's decision to take its foot off the gas while thousands of products have entered market has led to the epidemic we face today," Lowey said.\par \par \uc2 Gottlieb stressed that addressing youth e-cigarette use is a priority at the agency. "We're trying to thread a public health needle here where we preserve some element of the availability of these products for adults while foreclosing them for kids, or at least really dramatically curtailing the availability of kids to access these products," he said.\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 And here are a few more good reads:\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 TRUMP TEMPERATURE REPRODUCTIVE WARS MEDICAL MISSIVES INDUSTRY RX DAYBOOK Today\par \par \uc2 * The House Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies holds a\u160\'00\'A0hearing\u160\'00\'A0on female veterans access to VA.\par \par \uc2 * The Alliance for Health Policy holds a\u160\'00\'A0briefing\u160\'00\'A0on Capitol Hill on biosimilars.\par \par \uc2 SUGAR RUSH During his public congressional testimony, President Trump's former lawyer \uc2 Michael Cohen\uc2  repeatedly clashed with Republican lawmakers:\par \par \uc2 Rep.

All Rights Reserved \par \par \uc2 "This is a deep intellectual problem that is plaguing this city, which is that we've had thousands of Americans die year after year after year because of threats crossing our southern border."\par \par \uc2 - \uc2 Stephen Miller\uc2 , senior adviser to President Trump, in an interview with "Fox News Sunday," Feb. 17\par \par \uc2 Miller slipped in this line in the final seconds of his contentious interview with host Chris Wallace over Trump's emergency declaration to fund a wall along the southern border, so some viewers might have missed it. But it's an astonishing statement, suggesting that undocumented immigrants kill thousands of Americans every year.\par \par \uc2 Other anti-immigration advocates have made similar claims. Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) claimed in December that there are "thousands of Americans who are dead each year because [of] the Democrats' refusal to secure our borders." Trump said in 2018 that 63,000 Americans have been killed by illegal immigrants since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, which works out to about 3,700 a year.\par \par \uc2 But there is no evidence these claims are true. In fact, the available evidence suggests these claims are false. This is a good example about how a paucity of data allows political advocates to jump to conclusions.\par \par \uc2 The Facts\par \par \uc2 First, some context: There is no nationwide data set on crime committed by undocumented immigrants, so researchers have tried to tease the answer from less-than-complete data. Yet study after study shows that illegal immigration does not lead to increased crime, violence or drug problems. In fact, the studies indicate that undocumented immigrants commit crimes at lower rates than native-born Americans.\par \par \uc2 A 2018 study published in the peer-reviewed journal Criminology, led by Michael Light, a criminologist at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, examined whether places with higher percentages of undocumented immigrants have higher rates of violent crime such as murder or rape. The answer: States with larger shares of undocumented immigrants tended to have lower crime rates than states with smaller shares in the years 1990 through 2014. Similar results were found in another peer-reviewed study by the same researchers that looked at nonviolent crime, such as drug arrests and driving under the influence (DUI) arrests.\par \par \uc2 Similarly, the libertarian \uc2 Cato Institute\uc2  in 2018 looked at 2015 criminal conviction data among undocumented immigrants in Texas - one of the few states to record whether a person who has been arrested is in the country illegally or not. Researcher Alex Nowrasteh found that criminal conviction and arrest rates in Texas for undocumented immigrants were lower than those of native-born Americans for homicide, sexual assault and larceny.\par \par \uc2 "As a percentage of their respective populations, there were 50 percent fewer criminal convictions of illegal immigrants than of native-born Americans in Texas in 2015," Nowrasteh wrote. "The criminal conviction rate for legal immigrants was about 66 percent below the native-born rate."\par \par \uc2 In 2015, there were 785 homicide convictions in Texas. Of those, native-born Americans were convicted of 709 homicides (a conviction rate of 3.1 per 100,000), illegal immigrants were convicted of 46 homicides (2.6 per 100,000), and legal immigrants were convicted of 30 homicides (1 per 100,000). In other words, homicide conviction rates for illegal and legal immigrants were 16 percent and 67 percent below those of native-born Americans, respectively.\par \par \uc2 Some advocates of restraining immigration have sought to make the case that undocumented immigrants commit more crimes by relying on data from the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP), a federal program that offers states and localities some reimbursement for the cost of incarcerating certain criminal non-U. S. citizens. The \uc2 Government Accountability Office\uc2  (GAO) in July issued an updated report on SCAAP data, but GAO (and SCAAP) only counts total incarcerations, not individuals. Thus the numbers are not helpful for drawing conclusions about the criminality of undocumented immigrants.\par \par \uc2 In other words, the available research indicates that, when compared with U.S. citizens, illegal immigrants commit fewer crimes. But we understand that some people might argue that any crime committed by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  is one too many. Miller is involved in a counting exercise - thousands of deaths that in theory would not otherwise have happened if the undocumented immigrant had not set foot on U.S. soil.\par \par \uc2 But the available evidence does not support a count of thousands of deaths a year, either.\par \par \uc2 Nowrasteh pointed The Fact Checker to the Texas data. For the five years from 2014 through the end of 2018, there were 200 homicide convictions of illegal immigrants. We'll assume each conviction represents one person, although, of course, someone could have been convicted of multiple murders.\par \par \uc2 According to the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2  Estimate of the Illegal Alien Population Residing in the United States, in January 2015 there were 1.9 million illegal residents in Texas, or about 16 percent of the 12 million undocumented immigrants estimated by the agency nationwide. If one assumes that the homicide conviction rate is the same across the country - admittedly a big assumption - then that adds up to 1,250 homicide convictions over a five-year period, or 250 a year.\par \par \uc2 In the same five-year period, there were about 75,000 murders in the United States. The United States has a 70 percent conviction rate for murder, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, so that translates to illegal immigrants accounting for about 2.3 percent of homicide convictions from 2014 to 2018 while accounting for about 3.8 percent of the population.\par \par \uc2 Miller said "thousands of Americans" die each year. People tend to murder who they know and live with, so odds are many of these 250 or so murders are of other illegal immigrants, not Americans.\par \par \uc2 We should note that Brooks has justified his figure by citing people "murdered by illegal aliens, vehicular homicides by illegal aliens, or the illegal narcotics that are shipped into our country by illegal aliens and their drug cartels."\par \par \uc2 That slippery wording can be used to justify just about any American death from heroin. Although 90 percent of the heroin sold in the United States comes from Mexico, virtually all of it comes through legal points of entry. "A small percentage of all heroin seized by [Customs and Border Protection] along the land border was between Ports of Entry (POEs)," the \uc2 Drug Enforcement Administration\uc2  said in a 2018 report.\par \par \uc2 Miller spoke vaguely about "threats crossing our southern border," adding: "We have families and communities that are left unprotected and undefended. We have international narco terrorist organizations." The clear implication, especially with the use of the word "terrorist," was that people were being murdered. Adding drug deaths to the total is not justifiable given that Trump's proposed wall would not stem the flow of drugs.\par \par \uc2 The White House defended Miller's statement.\par \par \uc2 "\uc2 Stephen Miller\uc2 's comment is 100 percent correct because, sadly, thousands die every year from threats crossing our Southern Border," said White House principal deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley. He stated that "in the last two years alone, ICE arrested criminal aliens charged or convicted of approximately 4,000 homicides (and those are only the offenders authorities could track down)."\par \par \uc2 We've noted before that this 4,000 figure is misleading in this context. It conflates charges and convictions, and there is no indication how long ago homicides may have taken place.\par \par \uc2 Gidley also referenced drugs, even though, as we noted, most drugs come through ports of entry. "Three hundred Americans die every week from heroin overdoses - 90 percent of which enters from the Southern Border - and that horrific number doesn't even take into account deaths from cocaine, fentanyl and meth pouring across at record amounts. This is a dangerous and deadly situation that needlessly kills thousands of Americans every single year - and while the sad statistical truth may not aid The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2 's political agenda, the fact remains."\par \par \uc2 There's a website of victims that says it's "in honor of the thousands of American citizens killed each year by Illegal Aliens." There are entries as recently as January, but fewer than 300 people are listed even though entries date as far back as 1994. The anecdotal stories are moving, but one would expect a much longer list if thousands of people were really killed each year.\par \par \uc2 The Pinocchio Test\par \par \uc2 Miller is the senior presidential adviser responsible for immigration policy in the White House, so it's especially important for him to stick to verifiable facts on such an important issue. There's no evidence that thousands of Americans are killed by undocumented immigrants, especially in light of credible studies showing they commit crimes at lower rates than native-born Americans. He earns Four Pinocchios.\par \par \uc2 glenn.kessler@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com\par \par \uc2 WP20190224factchecker0224\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020190224ef2o0001t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National-Politics\par {\*\bkmkstart toc16}{\*\bkmkend toc16}\b \uc2 Trump once advocated a 'huge financial penalty' for those employing undocumented immigrants \b0\par\par\uc2 By Philip Bump \par \uc2 1,473 \uc2 words\par \uc2 8 February 2019\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2019, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 During the recent government shutdown, a number of people who worked for Trump National Golf Club in Westchester County, N.Y., were summoned to the facility \u8212\'20\'14 then closed for the season \u8212\'20\'14 for a meeting with their bosses. There, they were fired, some after years of service, because they were in the country illegally. The terminations followed a similar action at Trump's golf club in Bedminster, N.J., last year.\par \par \uc2 On Friday, The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2  reported that there are entire communities of former \uc2 Trump Organization\uc2  employees in Central America, people who once worked illegally for President Trump's sprawling resort empire as undocumented immigrants, often with their supervisors' knowledge. People who helped build the \uc2 Trump Organization\uc2  as it now is, some of whom were lucky to avoid the fate of those staffers in Westchester, moving back home before the politics of a president railing against illegal immigration while profiting from undocumented immigrants' work became untenable.\par \par \uc2 This issue came up during the campaign, too, on several occasions. As with so many other controversies that Trump faced during 2016, the question of his employing undocumented immigrants \u8212\'20\'14 as when The Post talked to people building his hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington \u8212\'20\'14 was quickly washed away by some other newer or bigger controversy. But when it came up, it prompted Trump to assert repeatedly that he was doing something he clearly wasn't: Screening his employees to make sure they could work legally in the United States.\par \par \uc2 At one point, in fact, he suggested that those who employ immigrants in the country illegally should face "a huge financial penalty" \u8212\'20\'14 or that it "could be beyond a financial penalty."\par \par \uc2 Trump repeatedly claimed on the campaign trail that his properties used a government program called E-Verify to ensure that \uc2 Trump Organization\uc2  employees were allowed to work in the country. As our David Fahrenthold points out, though, only some Trump properties used the system, while some others used a third-party system aimed at the same ostensible goal. The hotel in D.C., for example, does not appear to currently be using E-Verify, according to a search of the program's database.\par \par \uc2 In Beaumont, Tex., in November 2015, Trump told a rally audience that he ensured his business wouldn't hire undocumented employees. He was making a case for getting such immigrants out of the country, first endorsing a highly controversial Eisenhower-era deportation program and then claiming that, by shutting off employment opportunities, immigrants would leave of their own volition.\par \par \uc2 "Today we have things like E-Verify, where the employer will say, I'm sorry, I can't do it. I use now E-Verify in most of my jobs," Trump told the audience. "I have thousands and thousands of employees. I have hired tens of thousands of employees, many Hispanic, over the years. Many, many. They're fantastic. Many from Mexico. Today, many, many employees from Mexico. They're great."\par \par \uc2 "But I have \u8212\'20\'14 and I think, to me, it's very important \u8212\'20\'14 E-Verify," he continued. "So now I find out: Are they legal or not? Now, if they can't get a job, they're moving out. They're going to move out \u8212\'20\'14 No one has to \u8212\'20\'14 you don't need soldiers, they're going to move out. It's so simple. But a politician doesn't know this. A politician doesn't know it. They're all talk, they're no action. All they know how to do is get reelected."\par \par \uc2 At another point in the speech he allowed that some immigrants should be allowed to come in since, as he put it, the people in the audience there weren't going to pick grapes.\par \par \uc2 "If we need some people, we can bring people in on work visas," he said. From 2013 to 2016, the \uc2 Trump Organization\uc2  sought more than 500 visas for foreign workers. It has continued to do so.\par \par \uc2 Once the Republican primaries got underway in February 2016, Trump's opponents pointed to The Post's report about his hotel in Washington and to old reports about the construction of Trump Tower to link Trump to the hiring of undocumented workers. In an appearance on NBC's "Meet the Press" at the end of the month, host Chuck Todd asked Trump about it.\par \par \uc2 "Basically, the charge is this, Mr. Trump: You don't practice what you preach on immigration," Todd said.\par \par \uc2 Trump dismissed the Trump Tower story as old news. As for the hotel, he said that it was "one of the great hotels in the world that's currently being built on Pennsylvania Avenue."\par \par \uc2 "We do checks like you wouldn't believe," Trump said. "And they didn't name any names, they didn't give any information. We are very, very careful. We have an excellent contractor, one of the best in the country, works with me, because we build them, I negotiate everything. And that's why that job, by the way, is two years ahead of schedule and under budget."\par \par \uc2 "Do you use E-Verify in everything you do?" Todd asked a bit later.\par \par \uc2 "Yeah, I have it. I have E-Verify. Yes, I do," Trump said. "And I use E-Verify in that building. And The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2  mentioned that they spoke to people. There's no names. I read the story. It was from a few months ago. There were no names whatsoever, they have no proof, they have no evidence, no nothing. They saw people. And there were people coming out of the building."\par \par \uc2 "And they were absolutely, we go with E-Verify," he continued. "I am extremely strong on it, every time I have a contractor meeting on that building, and we're good fantastically well, you know, we're going to open that building in September, which will be very exciting, just before the election."\par \par \uc2 At the end of March, during a town hall meeting with MSNBC's Chris Matthews, an audience member asked about his immigration policy. Trump and Matthews soon got into a back-and-forth.\par \par \uc2 Matthews disparaged the wall.\par \par \uc2 "If you had to get here to get a job, you'd get here," he said. "And my question is this: What are we going to do about illegal hiring?"\par \par \uc2 "Well, you can do that with E-Verify and the various methods," Trump replied.\par \par \uc2 "Oh, you're for it?" Matthews asked about E-Verify.\par \par \uc2 "I'm for it," Trump said. "I use it."\par \par \uc2 "What should be the punishment for hiring someone \u8212\'20\'14 what should be the punishment for, really, you're collaborating with an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 ?" Matthews asked.\par \par \uc2 "You can be very, very strong," Trump replied. "It can be a huge financial penalty. It could be beyond a financial penalty."\par \par \uc2 What's beyond a financial penalty, of course, is a criminal penalty. Trump, apparently to mask what his own organization was doing, was advocating that those who, like him, employed undocumented immigrants, face steep fines or criminal charges.\par \par \uc2 "You know, I'm using E-Verify on just about every job, on Doral I'm using it, but I'm using it on the building, the old Post Office on Pennsylvania Avenue that I'm building into what will soon be a phenomenal hotel," Trump continued. "And I'm using E-Verify, and I'm telling you it works."\par \par \uc2 "But in principle," Matthews replied, "the person who hires someone illegally \u8212\'20\'14 I'm not talking about leaf-raking in front of the house or I'm going to push the snow out of the way \u8212\'20\'14 I'm talking about somebody who hires them to save money on labor. ... You're basically encouraging illegal immigration, because that's why this guy or woman is coming here, right?"\par \par \uc2 "Yes," Trump said, "and you can solve the problem with E-Verify and other systems."\par \par \uc2 In October, after \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  raised the question of Trump's use of undocumented workers at the D.C. hotel, Trump insisted he hadn't, for two reasons.\par \par \uc2 "Number one, I didn't want to," Trump said. "And number two, I'm running for president, why would I do that? So I went with the E-Verify system. We didn't have one \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  on the job. Everybody knows it. ... I would have saved probably a lot of money, right? But I have the E-Verify system. I didn't hire one \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  to build Trump International Hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue."\par \par \uc2 Late last month, the \uc2 Trump Organization\uc2  made an announcement: It would expand its use of E-Verify.\par \par \uc2 Voters who took Trump at his word that he'd used the system to ensure he wasn't being hypocritical about employing undocumented immigrants can now be more confident in 2020 that it's actually true.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020190208ef2800akm\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

Matt Gaetz\uc2  calls for Parkland fathers to be removed from House hearing on gun violence\b0\par\par\uc2 By Felicia Sonmez \par \uc2 649 \uc2 words\par \uc2 7 February 2019\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2019, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 A congressional hearing on gun violence erupted into recriminations on Wednesday after \uc2 Rep. Matt Gaetz\uc2  (R-Fla.) argued for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and called for the removal of two fathers whose children were killed in last year's mass shooting in Parkland, Fla.\par \par \uc2 Gaetz, one of President Trump's most vocal supporters on Capitol Hill, prompted an outcry from the Parkland fathers when he argued at a House Judiciary Committee hearing that illegal immigration is a greater threat to public safety than gun violence.\par \par \uc2 The panel was discussing H.R. 8, a bipartisan measure introduced in the House last month that would require background checks for all gun sales and most gun transfers.\par \par \uc2 "As we hear the stories and circumstances for those here, I hope we do not forget the pain and anguish and sense of loss felt by those all over the country who have been the victims of violence at the hands of illegal aliens," Gaetz said. "H.R. 8 would not have stopped many of the circumstances I raised, but a wall \u8212\'20\'14 a barrier on the southern border \u8212\'20\'14 may have, and that's what we're fighting for."\par \par \uc2 Two Parkland fathers, Manuel Oliver and Fred Guttenberg, were seated in the audience. Oliver, who lost his son Joaquin in the shooting, stood up and protested Gaetz's remarks; Guttenberg, whose daughter Jaime was killed, also spoke out.\par \par \uc2 Seventeen students and staff members were killed in the Feb. 14, 2018, shooting at \uc2 Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The committee's chairman, \uc2 Rep. Jerrold Nadler\uc2  (D-N.Y.), called for order and reminded audience members not to speak out during hearings. But moments later, as Gaetz resumed speaking and argued that undocumented immigrants are a greater threat than firearms, he again prompted a retort from Oliver.\par \par \uc2 After another admonition from Nadler, the room quieted down, and Rep. David N. Cicilline (D-R.I.) posed a question.\par \par \uc2 "Is there any committee rule that prevents a member of Congress from reciting false statements in a committee hearing that are unsupported by the evidence, or are members of Congress entitled to just make things up in support of specious arguments?" he asked, prompting applause from some in the room.\par \par \uc2 Later, Gaetz pointed his finger at Oliver and Guttenberg, asking whether there is a committee process that calls for audience members to be ejected for repeatedly interrupting members.\par \par \uc2 The hearing was the first on gun control in years. Democrats have made the issue a priority since retaking control of the House last month. Any gun-control legislation stands little chance of proceeding in the Senate, however, where Republicans retain the majority.\par \par \uc2 Both Guttenberg and Oliver were in the House chamber on Tuesday night for Trump's State of the Union address. Guttenberg was a guest of House Speaker \uc2 Nancy Pelosi\uc2  (D-Calif.), while Oliver was a guest of \uc2 Rep. Ted Deutch\uc2  (D-Fla.).\par \par \uc2 Oliver, an artist, has taken on the role of an activist in the year since the shooting. He recently performed a stand-up routine in which he denounced comedian Louis C.K. for mocking the Parkland victims; he and his wife have also started a gun-control group called Change the Ref.\par \par \uc2 Guttenberg, who has founded a group called Orange Ribbons for Jaime, has also been vocal on the issue of gun violence. He voiced disappointment in an op-ed for \uc2 Newsweek\uc2  on Wednesday that Trump "stayed silent" on the issue during his speech on Tuesday night.\par \par \uc2 "While watching this speech, sadly, I realized that had my daughter's killer been an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , the president would have mentioned it," Guttenberg said. "He failed to mention it because like so many victims of gun violence, she was killed by an American male."\par \par \uc2 felicia.sonmez@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020190207ef27000rt\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The Americans invited to sit with the first lady during the State of the Union on Tuesday night provide a window into the various themes the president will touch on during his annual address.\par \par \uc2 Some topics are obvious, such as illegal immigration. Others may suggest a departure from a typical Trump speech. The White House has already said President Trump will call for unity and bipartisanship before the joint session of Congress \u8212\'20\'14 though it's difficult to imagine such sentiments ringing true.\par \par \uc2 Hanging over the speech is Trump's insistence that there is a crisis of illegal immigration at the border that is threatening national security, although undocumented immigrants commit fewer violent crimes than native-born Americans. Still, Trump is definitely going to focus on his claims of a persistent risk to public safety when he talks about Nevada couple Gerald and Sharon David, who were killed in their home last month, allegedly by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . The couple's daughter, granddaughter and great-granddaughter are all attending the speech.\par \par \uc2 In contrast, several Democrats have invited immigrants hurt by Trump's hard-line approach to immigration, including a mother who was separated at the border from her children because of the administration's "zero-tolerance policy" that detained any person seeking to cross the border, even those declaring asylum at legal ports of entry.\par \par \uc2 Trump will also highlight two of his legislative achievements: passage of a criminal justice bill that allows for early release of low-level offenders, and a package of programs and policies meant to curb the nation's opioid epidemic. He has invited Matthew Charles, sentenced to 35 years in prison for selling crack cocaine and other related offenses in 1996. Charles was released in early January, thanks to the new law. Trump also invited Ashley Evans, an Ohio woman in recovery from opioid abuse.\par \par \uc2 Two of the worst shootings in the United States in 2018 will be represented, but the guests are meant to convey two different messages.\par \par \uc2 Trump invited an elderly Jewish man who survived the Tree of Life synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh. Timothy Matson, a police officer who responded to the scene and suffered gunshot wounds saving lives, will also be in attendance. But if Trump brings up gun violence at all, expect it to be focused on problems with mental health care in the United States, not access to firearms.\par \par \uc2 Democrats have invited people affected by the shooting at \uc2 Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School\uc2  in Parkland, Fla., including a student survivor turned anti-gun-violence activist and a father who lost his son in the massacre.\par \par \uc2 What's more likely is that Trump will use the synagogue shooting to bring up anti-Semitism or hate crimes generally, a topic he's been criticized for not coming out forcefully enough against. He's even been accused of fanning the flames.\par \par \uc2 To that end, Trump is going to talk about divisiveness in U.S. politics as an ill. He's invited a young boy who shares his last name and who has been subjected to bullying at school because of it. What singling out this boy does is allow Trump to show that it's not just his supporters with animus.\par \par \uc2 But this strategy could backfire by drawing more attention to how Trump's language and personal attacks have coarsened discourse.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020190205ef2500911\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 President Trump gives his third State of the Union address Tuesday night. (Well, technically his second. The first year's speech is an address to a joint session of Congress, because the president has been in office only a month at that point, so how can he already give a sweeping speech on what state the union is in?)\par \par \uc2 This is Trump's first speech to Congress with House Speaker \uc2 Nancy Pelosi\uc2  (D-Calif.) literally looking over his shoulder. It was originally scheduled for Jan. 29, but Pelosi refused to let Trump use the House chamber while the government was partially shut down. The speech is now occurring during a three-week reprieve in which Congress is supposed to figure out how to fund the government and secure the southern border in a way that both Trump and Democrats can support. That tension hanging over the speech will only add to the already fraught political climate in the room.\par \par \uc2 Here are six things to watch for during Trump's speech:\par \par \uc2 1. Will Trump double down on his demand for a wall?\par \par \uc2 As congressional negotiators try to avert another shutdown by making a deal on border security, Trump has made it clear that he could declare a national emergency if he doesn't get a border wall out of it. How much of the speech will be Trump making his case to the American people yet again that the border is in crisis and the only way to solve it is by building a wall?\par \par \uc2 If he does make a strong case for the wall, how will Republicans respond? Many of them don't want to have this fight any longer. Will they give a wall a rousing standing ovation as the Democrats sit stone-faced? Or will they just politely clap? That could say a lot about the mind-set of Republicans when it comes to building Trump's wall.\par \par \uc2 2. Will Democrats stand for anything?\par \par \uc2 The Trump White House is touting this State of the Union as a message of unity and bipartisanship. Those are themes that are difficult not to applaud for, but it's hard to imagine any Democrats standing for anything Trump has to say. Maybe, maybe they'll stand when he touts passage of the criminal justice bill and opioids package as examples of what can be accomplished when the parties work together.\par \par \uc2 But when he says, according to an excerpt of his prepared remarks, "Together we can break decades of political stalemate. We can bridge old divisions, heal old wounds, build new coalitions, forge new solutions and unlock the extraordinary promise of America's future. The decision is ours to make," will any Democrats give that a standing ovation? The words are likely to ring hollow to most Democrats in the room.\par \par \uc2 A number of Democrats who boycotted Trump's speech last year plan to do so again. \uc2 Rep. Earl Blumenauer\uc2  (D-Ore.) said in a statement: "The thought of spending Tuesday night in the House Chamber listening to the reckless, self-centered man who occupies the White House holds no interest for me. Just like in past years, I plan to skip a speech that will be filled with lies, deception and divisiveness."\par \par \uc2 3. What will the expression on Pelosi\u8217\'20\'19s face be?\par \par \uc2 Pelosi is the consummate professional, and she's unlikely to show her emotions. But from her perch beside Vice President Pence, staring at the back of Trump's head and into a sea of her colleagues, will she be able to avoid a smirk, an eye roll or a grimace? She'll most likely sit there stoically, not betraying her inner monologue. But it'll be fun to imagine what she's thinking, especially since she's still riding high after Trump allowed the government to reopen without his border wall money.\par \par \uc2 4. Who are the guests?\par \par \uc2 Members of Congress are allowed to bring guests to watch the State of the Union from the wrap-around balcony that overlooks the floor, and usually their invitations are symbolic of current politics. The same is true of the White House's guests, who are invited to sit with the first lady to watch the address.\par \par \uc2 The Trump's guests, announced Monday night, provide a hint at some topics the president will touch on in his speech. For instance, there's a family whose loved ones were killed by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 ; a man convicted on drug charges released early due to criminal justice reforms; a woman who struggled with opioid addiction; and a little boy named Joshua Trump who has been bullied at school because of his name.\par \par \uc2 Some of the guests announced by Democrats send a very pointed message to the president. There are two associated with the Parkland, Fla., high school massacre: \uc2 Cameron Kasky\uc2 , a student who survived the shooting and became an anti-gun-violence activist, and Manny Oliver, whose son Joaquin was killed. Several lawmakers are bringing transgender service members. There's an immigrant mother who was separated from her children at the border last summer, individuals furloughed during the shutdown and young immigrant "dreamers." \uc2 Washington Post\uc2  colleague Elise Viebeck has more details about all the guests here.\par \par \uc2 Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) is bringing Ana Maria Archila, one of the women who, in the midst of the \uc2 Brett Kavanaugh\uc2  accusations, confronted \uc2 Sen. Jeff Flake\uc2  (R-Ariz.) as he was getting into an elevator to tearfully describe to him their own experiences with sexual assault. After the encounter, carried live on television, Flake demanded a one-week \uc2 FBI\uc2  investigation into Kavanaugh before the Senate voted on his Supreme Court nomination. Flake ultimately supported him, but it was a watershed moment.\par \par \uc2 Speaking of Kavanaugh ...\par \par \uc2 5. How will lawmakers greet Kavanaugh?\par \par \uc2 Assuming he attends, as most Supreme Court justices do, Kavanaugh will be in the chamber Tuesday night for Trump's speech. Now, there's a good chance he has no direct interaction with any Democrats. Typically, lawmakers who want face time with the principals who parade down the center aisle stake out a seat early in the day. I don't imagine many Democrats are going to be falling over themselves to get a chance to shake Trump's hand on national television. But just Kavanaugh's presence could be uncomfortable for some. Additionally, how will Republicans greet him? Will there be a lot of back slapping and handshakes? And how will Kavanaugh respond to their greetings?\par \par \uc2 6. Will anything unexpected happen?\par \par \uc2 State of the Unions are pretty straightforward affairs. They follow the same script year after year, no matter who the president is. Trump's first two joint-session addresses were by and large unexciting, save for when he led an extended standing ovation for a soldier's recent widow. But otherwise they were cookie cutter. Trump read from a teleprompter. Republicans clapped. Democrats did not.\par \par \uc2 But with a new crop of lawmakers in the audience, and a broad spectrum of guests in the gallery with a lot of grievances, it's not hard to imagine an outburst or other disturbance. Though probably not.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020190205ef25005ej\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

Maurits van der Veen \par \uc2 847 \uc2 words\par \uc2 23 January 2019\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2019, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 In President Trump's Oval Office address on Jan. 8, he argued that "thousands of Americans have been brutally killed by those who illegally entered our country" and that "uncontrolled, illegal migration \u8230\'20\'26 strains public resources and drives down wages," particularly for "African Americans and Hispanic Americans."\par \par \uc2 These statements link Latinos to illegality, criminality and economic threat. Many researchers have found that when the U.S. news media discusses Latinos, it often emphasizes such highly negative themes.\par \par \uc2 But is that usually true? Is most media coverage of Latinos negative?\par \par \uc2 When we examined this question, the results surprised us. As we expected, some U.S. newspaper coverage of Latinos is highly negative. But not all. In fact, most articles aren't negative. Many, in fact, are full of positive references to Latino achievements and culture.\par \par \uc2 Here's how we did our research\par \par \uc2 To gauge newspaper coverage, we used dictionaries of positive and negative words (such as "beautiful" or "attack") to calculate the tone of individual articles. Roughly speaking, the more positive words in an article, the more positive we rate the article, and vice versa. We established a baseline for "neutrality" in the U.S. print media by finding the average tone of a representative sample of more than 48,000 articles drawn from a range of U.S. newspapers between 1996 and 2016.\par \par \uc2 We then collected more than 185,000 articles published in those same years by searching for variations on the root words "Latino" and "Hispanic" in 17 U.S. newspapers. Our newspapers included nationally circulating publications such as The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2  and the Wall Street Journal, regional papers like the San Jose Mercury News and Minneapolis Star Tribune, and tabloids like the New York Post and Philadelphia Daily News.\par \par \uc2 To understand how often these articles mentioned a particular theme, we tagged each article that contained words related to a topic. For example, any article that mentioned "\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 " or "illegal immigration" was tagged for that theme. Articles containing root words such as "unemployment," "welfare," or "poverty" were tagged for economic threat, and so on.\par \par \uc2 The negative newspaper coverage of Latinos\par \par \uc2 We first examined how often articles mention different topics. We found that 53 percent of the articles contained words related to the three prominent negative themes, with some touching on more than just one. Criminality is mentioned in 37 percent of the articles; economic threat in 21 percent; and illegal immigration in just 12 percent of articles about Latinos.\par \par \uc2 As you can see in the graph below, two-thirds of all articles tagged for criminality are negative \u8212\'20\'14 and more than a third of the articles mention criminality. Moreover, the average negative article mentioning Latino crime is highly negative \u8212\'20\'14 more negative than 7 out of 8 randomly selected newspaper articles.\par \par \uc2 The upbeat coverage of Latinos\par \par \uc2 At the same time, more than half of our 185,000 articles were positive.\par \par \uc2 Two topics stood out as sources of positive media coverage of Latinos. We tagged articles that mentioned "achievement," which note excellence and social contributions; grouped in that category were articles that included the words "achievement," "contribution," "award," "excellence," "qualified," "nominated," "scored," "talent," "wise" and "stride." We tagged another category "culture," for pieces about group culture or Latino communities; in that category were articles including the words "flair," "pride," "quincea\u241\'00\'F1era," "flavor," "fest," "tradition," "culture," "heritage" and "authentically." One culture article, for example, discusses the Denver Film Society's second annual CineLatino festival, describing it as a "small but energetic event celebrating Latino filmmakers."\par \par \uc2 Many articles that mentioned Latinos had one of these two positive themes. We found words noting achievements in 23 percent of all articles and words about culture in 32 percent.\par \par \uc2 Moreover, articles using these words were especially positive. As the figure below shows, 70 percent of articles tagged for culture and 73 percent of those tagged for achievement are positive. The difference between positive and negative topics is striking.\par \par \uc2 Overall, which tone dominates?\par \par \uc2 While U.S. newspapers offer a noteworthy amount of positive coverage of Latinos and Hispanics, it may not fully offset the negative coverage. The front pages probably include much of the negative coverage, in keeping with the television news slogan "If it bleeds, it leads"; the sports, arts and features inside sections are a more natural home for much of the positive cultural coverage. Research has also shown that negative information has a greater impact on attitudes than positive ones.\par \par \uc2 In the end, while the news about Latinos is not all bad, pronouncements like Trump's \u8212\'20\'14 and stories about criminality in particular \u8212\'20\'14 are likely to continue to color readers' perspectives on Latinos for years to come.\par \par \uc2 Erik Bleich is Charles A.

This includes a new system to allow Central American minors to apply for asylum in their home countries, and reform to promote family reunification for unaccompanied children, thousands of whom wind up on our border doorstep."\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 President Trump, in remarks at the White House , Jan. 19, 2019\par \par \uc2 "We have asked Congress to close border security loopholes so that \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  children can be safely and humanely returned back home."\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 Trump, in an Oval Office address on immigration , Jan. 8, 2019\par \par \uc2 "We want to save lives. We want children to be safe. The children are being decimated. And I'm not talking about necessarily children in our country. I'm talking about wonderful children that are coming up from other places, whether it's Honduras or Guatemala, or El Salvador or Mexico, or other places. And we have to take care of those children also. We can't let them die on the way up."\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 Trump, in a Rose Garden news conference , Jan. 4, 2019\par \par \uc2 President Trump says he's concerned for Central American children making a potentially hazardous trek to the United States. But his noble sentiments and honeyed words are at odds with the tough-love solution he's proposing.\par \par \uc2 The journey from Central America to the U.S.-Mexico border comes with risks. The White House notes that "nearly one-third of women are sexually assaulted." This statistic comes from \uc2 Doctors Without Borders\uc2 , which interviewed 56 women for a report in 2017 and found that 31.4 percent were "sexually abused" on the journey; 10.7 percent were raped.\par \par \uc2 The same report says: "The violence experienced by the population of the NTCA [Northern Triangle of Central America] is not unlike that of individuals living through war. Citizens are murdered with impunity, kidnappings and extortion are daily occurrences. Non-state actors perpetuate insecurity and forcibly recruit individuals into their ranks, and use sexual violence as a tool of intimidation and control. This generalized and pervasive threat of violence contributes to an increasingly dire reality for the citizens of these countries."\par \par \uc2 Many Central American children and families are fleeing to the United States because of safety concerns and high poverty. The journey is risky, but for many of them, so is the prospect of staying home. Trump's proposal would require these children to stay home and grant asylum to 15,000 minors at most from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras per year.\par \par \uc2 There's a disconnect between Trump's concern for child safety and what his proposal would mean for children. So, we're going to outline six big changes his bill would make to the asylum system for Central American minors.\par \par \uc2 The Facts\par \par \uc2 Trump's plan to reopen the government comes with a sweeping rewrite of U.S. humanitarian laws. One of the biggest changes would reduce opportunities for Central American minors to obtain asylum. That could violate international law on protections for refugees, according to experts and pro-immigration groups.\par \par \uc2 Applying from home\par \par \uc2 Under current law, immigrants who fear persecution may apply for asylum in the United States, regardless of how they entered the country. Trump's proposal \u8212\'20\'14 the "Central American Minors Protection Act of 2019" \u8212\'20\'14 would bar asylum claims by minors from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras who show up at the border.\par \par \uc2 These minors would have to apply for asylum while remaining in their home countries or another country. The total number of asylum grants for Guatemalan, Honduran and Salvadoran minors would be capped at 15,000 per year.\par \par \uc2 "This is a major change to asylum law that will block tens of thousands of children who are now showing up at our borders from ever getting protection," said Greg Chen, director of government relations for the \uc2 American Immigration Lawyers Association\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 There's no breakdown of how many Central American minors obtain asylum each year under current law, but it's well known that tens of thousands such children are showing up at the border seeking entry. Nearly 58,600 unaccompanied children, and thousands more who came with family members, were encountered at the southern border in fiscal 2018, according to Customs and Border Protection data.\par \par \uc2 Immigration judges granted asylum to 20,524 individuals (both children and adults) from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras in fiscal 2018. That total doesn't include unaccompanied children who obtained asylum through a separate process run by \uc2 U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 What would happen to Central American minors who showed up at the border anyway and requested asylum?\par \par \uc2 The United Nations Convention and Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees says governments should not return refugees to the places where they face threats. "The principle of nonrefoulement is so fundamental that no reservations or derogations may be made to it," the \uc2 U.N\uc2 . agreement says. "It provides that no one shall expel or return ('refouler') a refugee against his or her will, in any manner whatsoever, to a territory where he or she fears threats to life or freedom."\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 U.N\uc2 . protocol on refugees also says governments should not discriminate based on "country of origin," but Trump wants carve-outs in the asylum laws for El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras.\par \par \uc2 It's possible that the Trump administration would grant a lesser form of asylum known as "withholding of removal" to Central American minors at the border. But that's not in the text of the legislation, so it's an open question for now, said Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, a policy analyst at the \uc2 American Immigration Council\uc2 . Reichlin-Melnick said Trump's proposal would invite legal challenges.\par \par \uc2 The Trump administration has said the \uc2 U.N\uc2 . refugee protocol is "not directly enforceable in U.S. law." But it has noted that the \uc2 U.S. government\uc2  avoided refoulement issues in the past by using "withholding of removal," according to a rule proposal submitted in November.\par \par \uc2 "These treaties are not directly enforceable in U.S. law, but some of the obligations they contain have been implemented through domestic implementing legislation," the rule proposal says. "For example, the United States has implemented the non-refoulement provisions of these treaties \u8212\'20\'14 i.e., provisions prohibiting the return of an individual to a country where he or she would face persecution or torture \u8212\'20\'14 through the withholding of removal provisions."\par \par \uc2 Representatives for the Senate sponsor of the legislation, Appropriations Committee Chairman \uc2 Richard C. Shelby\uc2  (R-Ala.), referred questions to the Trump administration. The White House did not respond to our questions.\par \par \uc2 Having a process to request asylum from outside the United States is not a new idea. What makes Trump's proposal unique is that he would do this while simultaneously barring asylum claims from Central American children who present themselves in the United States. (According to the Daily Beast, Central American minors at the border would still be able to seek Special Immigrant Juvenile Status, but that system is already backlogged and requires children to "prove in family court that they were abandoned or abused by a parent.")\par \par \uc2 Qualified parent or guardian\par \par \uc2 Under another change Trump wants, minors from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras seeking asylum would need to have "a qualified parent or guardian in the United States capable of taking custody and care of the minor upon arrival."\par \par \uc2 That provision could bar many asylum claims. The bill does not define what it means to be a "qualified" parent or guardian. For context, border officials encountered 58,600 unaccompanied minors in fiscal 2018, most of them from Central America. In addition, thousands more Central American minors at the border were traveling with parents or legal guardians. There's no breakdown, but the total for all children and adults encountered as family units was 161,113 in fiscal 2018.\par \par \uc2 'National interest'\par \par \uc2 The Trump bill says the secretary of Homeland Security may approve asylum applications for minors from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras "consistent with the national interest." The term "national interest" is not defined in the bill and, as we've noted, neither the Senate sponsor nor the White House answered our questions.\par \par \uc2 Fee\par \par \uc2 Reichlin-Melnick said that under current law, Central American minors do not pay a fee to apply for asylum. "Asylum applications and refugee applications do not cost money, because people fleeing persecution often don't flee with assets," he said.\par \par \uc2 Trump's bill would impose a fee to cover "the cost of processing the application" and also an "amount necessary to deter frivolous applications." It's unclear what this fee would total; the bill leaves those particulars to the secretary of Homeland Security.\par \par \uc2 Judicial review\par \par \uc2 Trump's proposal would restrict opportunities for Central American minors to challenge the administration's asylum decisions in court. The legislation says "no court or immigration judge shall have jurisdiction to review a determination of the Secretary of Homeland Security" on whether to grant asylum to minors from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. Under current law, asylum decisions by executive branch officials can be appealed to the U.S. judicial branch up to the Supreme Court.\par \par \uc2 Trafficking protection\par \par \uc2 The Trump proposal would relax a key provision in the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (TVPRA), a law that gives safe harbor to victims of human trafficking.\par \par \uc2 As a provision of the TVPRA, unaccompanied children from noncontiguous countries such as El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras remain in the United States while their cases are evaluated. Trump's proposal would change that, allowing U.S. officials to return children from those three countries promptly unless an "immigration officer determines that it is more probable than not that the unaccompanied alien child will be trafficked on return to his or her country" or determines that the child could qualify for asylum.\par \par \uc2 The Bottom Line\par \par \uc2 Those worried for the safety of Central American children should keep in mind that many of them are in danger whether they journey to the United States or remain in Central America.\par \par \uc2 Trump says the humane solution is: Stay home, wait your turn. That turn might never come under the bill he's proposing, since it's loaded with new obstacles. What the bill does is put the problem at someone else's door, using safety concerns as a fig leaf.\par \par \uc2 (About our rating scale)\par \par \uc2 Send us facts to check by filling out this form\par \par \uc2 Sign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletter\par \par \uc2 The Fact Checker is a verified signatory to the International Fact-Checking Network code of principles\par \par \uc2 Share the Facts 2019-01-23 15:38:04 UTC \uc2 Washington Post\uc2  -1 -1 -1 \uc2 Washington Post\uc2  Rating: Not the whole story "We want to save lives.

\par\par \uc2 National-Politics\par {\*\bkmkstart toc22}{\*\bkmkend toc22}\b \uc2 Trump seeks to resurrect a long-dormant phrase: 'illegal alien' \b0\par\par\uc2 By Aaron Blake \par \uc2 503 \uc2 words\par \uc2 14 January 2019\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2019, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 President Trump's rhetoric on immigration has been contentious from Day One of his campaign \u8212\'20\'14 literally. He rode down that golden elevator in Trump Tower and declared undocumented immigrants to be "criminals," "rapists" and drug-pushers. He commenced a campaign in which crimes committed by undocumented immigrants would take center stage. Separately, he called for a total ban on immigration by Muslims. As president, his administration forced the separation of families at the border, before a backlash pushed them to reverse course.\par \par \uc2 But through it all, even Trump largely avoided an antiquated phrase for these immigrants \u8212\'20\'14 until now, that is.\par \par \uc2 Even as politicians and the media have increasingly shifted away from the phrase "\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 " and toward "undocumented immigrant," Trump over the past several months has taken a hard turn in the other direction. With increasing regularity, he is employing the phrase "illegal alien" \u8212\'20\'14 a term that appears throughout the legal code but has been almost completely absent from the words of politicians in recent years.\par \par \uc2 According to Factba.se's tracking of Trump's public comments, he used the phrase in his own words twice in 2015 and five times in 2016 \u8212\'20\'14 a total of seven times as a candidate, even as he was campaigning hard and talking about illegal immigration nearly every day. Then he used it only twice in his first year as president. That's nine total mentions in two and a half years.\par \par \uc2 Over the past six months, though, Trump has used the phrase on at least 35 different occasions. It all culminated last week when he used the phrase four times in 10 minutes in his first prime-time Oval Office address. He also tweeted it three times over the weekend, including twice in someone else's words and once in his own \u8212\'20\'14 only the third time he has used the phrase on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  without quoting someone else.\par \par \uc2 The reason for the rhetorical shift from "illegal alien" to "\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 " was similar to the reason for the shift from "\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 " to "undocumented immigrant." While many politicians (mostly Democrats) have decided people can't be "illegal" \u8212\'20\'14 even if their method of entry was \u8212\'20\'14 almost all politicians have made the decision that "alien" unfairly connoted invaders who were not human.\par \par \uc2 A \uc2 Pew Research Center\uc2  study in 2013 found that just 5 percent of newspaper references used the term "illegal alien" \u8212\'20\'14 down from about 1 in 5 references in both 2007 and 1996. The study was conducted as news organizations were shifting from "illegal" to "undocumented."\par \par \uc2 The law, though, still refers to "illegal aliens," and the Justice Department last year (under the guidance of immigration hard-liner Jeff Sessions) issued guidance making sure U.S. attorneys used the phrase. And a president who has shown an ability to move the public discourse appears to be trying to resurrect an old-fashioned phrase \u8212\'20\'14 in the service of pursuing an old-fashioned solution to illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020190114ef1e00c9p\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National-Politics\par {\*\bkmkstart toc23}{\*\bkmkend toc23}\b \uc2 Fact-checking President Trump's Oval Office address on immigration \b0\par\par\uc2 By Salvador Rizzo \par \uc2 2,443 \uc2 words\par \uc2 10 January 2019\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2019, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The first misleading statement in President Trump's Oval Office address Tuesday night came in the first sentence.\par \par \uc2 Trump, addressing a national television audience from behind his desk, warned of a "security crisis at the southern border" \u8212\'20\'14 even though the number of people caught trying to cross illegally is near 20-year lows.\par \par \uc2 Another false claim came moments later, when Trump said border agents "encounter thousands of illegal immigrants trying to enter our country" every day, though his administration puts the daily average for 2018 in the hundreds. A few sentences later, he said 90 percent of the heroin in the United States comes across the border with Mexico, ignoring the fact that most of the drugs come through legal entry points and wouldn't be stopped by the border wall that he is demanding as the centerpiece of his showdown with Democrats.\par \par \uc2 Over the course of his nine-minute speech, Trump painted a misleading and bleak picture of the situation at the U.S.-Mexico border. He pumped up some numbers, exaggerated the public safety risks of immigration and repeated false claims regarding how to fund a border wall.\par \par \uc2 The appearance, coming as a partial federal government shutdown resulting from the wall fight enters its third week, underscored the extent to which Trump has relied on false and misleading claims to justify what has long been his signature political issue.\par \par \uc2 One false claim noticeably absent from the speech was the assertion made by the president and many of his allies in recent days that terrorists are infiltrating the country by way of the southern border. Fact-checkers and TV anchors, including those on Fox News, spent days challenging the truthfulness of the claim.\par \par \uc2 Below are the truths behind Trump's claims from the Oval Office address:\par \par \uc2 "Tonight I am speaking to you because there is a growing humanitarian and security crisis at our southern border."\par \par \uc2 By any available measure, there is no new security crisis at the border.\par \par \uc2 Apprehensions of people trying to cross the southern border peaked most recently at 1.6 million in 2000 and have been in decline since, falling to just under 400,000 in fiscal 2018. The decline is partly because of technology upgrades; tougher penalties in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks; a decline in migration rates from Mexico; and a sharp increase in the number of Border Patrol officers. The fiscal 2018 number was up from just over 300,000 apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border for fiscal 2017, the lowest level in more than 45 years.\par \par \uc2 There are far more cases of travelers overstaying their visas than southern border apprehensions. In fiscal 2017, the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2  reported 606,926 suspected in-country overstays, or twice the number of southern border apprehensions. In fiscal 2016, U.S. officials reported 408,870 southern border apprehensions and 544,676 suspected in-country overstays.\par \par \uc2 While overall numbers of migrants crossing illegally are down, since 2014 more families from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras have begun to trek to the United States in search of safer conditions or economic opportunities, creating a humanitarian crisis.\par \par \uc2 "Record numbers of migrant families are streaming into the United States, overwhelming border agents and leaving holding cells dangerously overcrowded with children, many of whom are falling sick," The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2  reported Jan. 5. "Two Guatemalan children taken into U.S. custody died in December."\par \par \uc2 "Every day Customs and Border Patrol agents encounter thousands of illegal immigrants trying to enter our country."\par \par \uc2 Southern border apprehensions in fiscal 2018 averaged 30,000 a month (or 1,000 a day). They ticked up in the first two months of fiscal 2019, but it's a stretch to say "thousands" a day. Better to say "hundreds."\par \par \uc2 "America proudly welcomes millions of lawful immigrants who enrich our society and contribute to our nation, but all Americans are hurt by uncontrolled illegal migration. It strains public resources and drives down jobs and wages. Among those hardest hit are African Americans and Hispanic Americans."\par \par \uc2 Some context here: In general, economists say illegal immigration tends to affect less-educated and low-skilled American workers the most, which disproportionately encompasses black men and recently arrived, low-educated legal immigrants, including Latinos.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 U.S. Commission on Civil Rights\uc2  in 2010 found that illegal immigration has tended to depress wages and employment for black men. However, there are other factors at play, and "halting illegal immigration is not a panacea even for the problem of depressed wage rates for low-skilled jobs," the commission found.\par \par \uc2 The consensus among economic research studies is that the impact of immigration is primarily a net positive for the U.S. economy and to workers overall, especially over the long term. According to a comprehensive 2016 report by the \uc2 National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine\uc2  on the economic impacts of the U.S. immigration system, studies on the impact of immigration showed "the seemingly paradoxical result that although larger immigration flows may generate higher rates of unemployment in some sectors, overall, the rate of unemployment for native workers declines."\par \par \uc2 "Our southern border is a pipeline for vast quantities of illegal drugs, including meth, heroin, cocaine and fentanyl. Every week, 300 of our citizens are killed by heroin alone, 90 percent of which floods across from our southern border."\par \par \uc2 In 2017, more than 15,000 people died of drug overdoses involving heroin in the United States, according to the \uc2 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\uc2 . That works out to about 300 a week.\par \par \uc2 But while 90 percent of the heroin sold in the United States comes from Mexico, virtually all of it comes through legal points of entry. "A small percentage of all heroin seized by [Customs and Border Protection] along the land border was between Ports of Entry (POEs)," the \uc2 Drug Enforcement Administration\uc2  said in a 2018 report. So Trump's wall would do little to halt drug trafficking. Trump's repeated claim that the wall would stop drug trafficking is a Bottomless Pinocchio claim.\par \par \uc2 "In the last two years, ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of aliens with criminal records, including those charged or convicted of 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 violent killings. Over the years, thousands of Americans have been brutally killed by those who illegally entered our country, and thousands more lives will be lost if we don't act right now."\par \par \uc2 Trump warns about dangerous criminals, but the numbers he's citing involve a mix of serious and nonviolent offenses such as immigration violations. \uc2 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2  reports yearly arrest totals without breaking down the type of offense, which could be anything from homicide to a DUI to illegal entry.\par \par \uc2 Notice how Trump switches quickly from the 266,000 arrests over two years to charges and convictions: "100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 violent killings." In many cases, the people arrested face multiple counts, so that switch gives a confusing picture.\par \par \uc2 In fiscal 2018, ICE conducted 158,581 administrative arrests for civil immigration violations. The agency's year-end report says two-thirds (105,140) of those involved people with criminal convictions and one-fifth (32,977) involved people with pending criminal charges. Of the 143,470 administrative arrests in 2017, 74 percent involved people with criminal records and 15.5 percent involved people who had pending charges. But these totals cover all types of offenses \u8212\'20\'14 including illegal entry or reentry.\par \par \uc2 In the fiscal 2018 breakdown, 16 percent of all the charges and convictions were immigration and related offenses.\par \par \uc2 "Last month, 20,000 migrant children were illegally brought into the United States, a dramatic increase. These children are used as human pawns by vicious coyotes and ruthless gangs."\par \par \uc2 No government statistic tracks children smuggled in by bad actors, "coyotes" or drug gangs. What Trump is referring to is CBP's number for family unit apprehensions and unaccompanied minors. The family unit by definition must include at least one parent or legal guardian and one minor. (There's a separate figure for unaccompanied alien children.)\par \par \uc2 DHS spokeswoman Katie Waldman said the December total for apprehensions of unaccompanied children and those with family members was 19,313. But it's wrong to describe it as a statistic that represents children being smuggled into the country.\par \par \uc2 Trump describes this as children being smuggled in by coyotes or gangs, but border officials screen for false claims of parentage. To imply as Trump does that a child's mother, father or legal guardian is or hired a smuggler, coyote or gang member in all of these cases is wrong.\par \par \uc2 (Correction: A previous version of this story said Trump understated the number of migrant children apprehended last month at the southern border, based on November data. The December data, which DHS released after Trump's speech, show the number is around 20,000, as Trump said. The story incorrectly described the way \uc2 U.S. Customs and Border Protection\uc2  counts children and family members who are caught attempting to cross the border, or "family unit apprehensions." The term refers to a monthly tally published by the agency of the total number of children, parents or legal guardians who are caught together at the border, not the number of families.)\par \par \uc2 "Furthermore, we have asked Congress to close border security loopholes so that \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  children can be safely and humanely returned back home."\par \par \uc2 The Trump administration considers the Flores settlement agreement a loophole. That policy requires the government to release unaccompanied immigrant children who are caught crossing the border within 20 days to family members, foster homes or "least restrictive" settings.\par \par \uc2 The president also wants to tighten U.S. asylum laws generally and the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act, with the goal of restricting some immigrants' opportunities to file asylum petitions. Trump describes these asylum provisions as "border security loopholes," but supporters call them core provisions of U.S. laws that cover refugees.\par \par \uc2 "Finally, as part of an overall approach to border security, law enforcement professionals have requested $5.7 billion for a physical barrier. At the request of Democrats, it will be a steel barrier rather than a concrete wall."\par \par \uc2 Trump suggests that Democrats requested a steel barrier rather than a concrete wall, but the proposed switch to steel was an idea the Trump administration brought up. No Democrats are on record demanding a steel barrier along the U.S.-Mexico border.\par \par \uc2 "This is just common sense. The border wall would very quickly pay for itself. The cost of illegal drugs exceeds $500 billion a year, vastly more than the $5.7 billion we have requested from Congress."\par \par \uc2 Trump tweeted a similar claim in March, citing a study from the Center for Immigration Studies, which supports more restrictive immigration policies. Essentially, the claim that the wall pays for itself turns on three numbers: a) estimated savings from each undocumented immigrant blocked by the wall, b) the total number of undocumented immigrants stopped over 10 years and, and c) the cost of the wall.\par \par \uc2 It's (a) $75,000 multiplied by (b) 160,000 to 200,000 equals (c) $12 billion to $15 billion. So, if the wall actually costs $25 billion, the number of undocumented immigrants halted by the wall would need to be doubled, or one has to assume it would take 20 years to earn the money back. But other experts offer different estimates for each of those numbers.\par \par \uc2 Plus, as we've previously reported, the wall would do little to stop drugs from entering the United States, since they primarily come in through legal points of entry, making the cost of illegal drugs irrelevant to this issue.\par \par \uc2 "The wall will also be paid for indirectly by the great new trade deal we have made with Mexico."\par \par \uc2 This is a Four Pinocchio claim. During the campaign, Trump more than 200 times promised Mexico would pay for the wall, which the administration says would cost at least $18 billion. Now he says a minor reworking of the \uc2 North American Free Trade Agreement\uc2  (\uc2 NAFTA\uc2 ) will earn enough money for pay for the wall.\par \par \uc2 This betrays a misunderstanding of economics. Countries do not "lose" money on trade deficits, so there is no money to earn; the size of a trade deficit or surplus can be determined by other factors besides trade. Congress must still appropriate the money, and the trade agreement has not been ratified.\par \par \uc2 "Senator \uc2 Chuck Schumer\uc2 , who you will be hearing from later tonight, has repeatedly supported a physical barrier in the past, along with many other Democrats. They changed their mind only after I was elected president."\par \par \uc2 Schumer, \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  and many other Democrats voted for the Secure Fence Act of 2006, which authorized building a fence along nearly 700 miles of the border between the United States and Mexico. But the fence they voted for is not as substantial as the wall Trump is proposing. Trump himself has called the 2006 fence a "nothing wall."\par \par \uc2 Michelle Ye Hee Lee and Meg Kelly contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 Share the Facts 2019-01-09 19:11:56 UTC \uc2 Washington Post\uc2  -1 -1 -1 \uc2 Washington Post\uc2  Rating: Not the whole story "Our southern border is a pipeline for vast quantities of illegal drugs, including meth, heroin, cocaine and fentanyl.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Mark Morgan, a career \uc2 FBI\uc2  official who served as Border Patrol chief for the last six months of the Obama administration before being removed once President Trump took office, has come out this week in support of a border wall.\par \par \uc2 Morgan, who has kept a low profile since he was forced to step down, first gave an interview to Law and Crime in which he defended the White House's desire to build a wall along the U.S. southern border.\par \par \uc2 The morning after Trump reiterated in a prime-time address to the nation why wall funding was worth shutting down 25 percent of the federal government, Morgan told The Fix that he's breaking his silence because, in his view, the wall is an important piece in a group of policy changes needed to secure the border.\par \par \uc2 "I was removed. I'm standing up and saying, 'I should have disdain for them, but I don't because they are right,' " Morgan said. "I can stand up and say they are right because it's the right thing to do for this country. I'm begging the president to stay the course."\par \par \uc2 Morgan's comments, which have been widely disseminated by right-leaning media, are sure to embolden Republicans as Trump heads to Capitol Hill to encourage GOP members to stick with him as some reportedly begin to lose patience as the shutdown enters its 19th day.\par \par \uc2 When Morgan was pushed out in January 2017, it was reported that the Border Patrol union, which has been loyal to Trump and his policies since his candidacy, didn't believe Morgan was making border security a priority and lobbied the administration for him to be replaced.\par \par \uc2 Morgan says now that some "wires got crossed" and that he had supported Trump's call for a wall since "day one." But during a congressional hearing, he was asked whether he supported "comprehensive immigration reform," and he said, "yes." What he meant, he says now, was a holistic approach to how immigrants come into the country, which would include a barrier, enhanced technology and more personnel, as well as more bed space in holding facilities, more immigration judges and aid to Central American countries to help them improve their quality of life. What he didn't mean, and what many misinterpreted, was a path to citizenship or permanent status.\par \par \uc2 Echoing many of the GOP's recent talking points, Morgan said he didn't understand why Democrats supported a border fence in 2006 but now say a border wall is "immoral."\par \par \uc2 "The issue is political, so we have to be honest about that," he said. "The substantive issue is what is important, it doesn't matter whether it's called the Secure Fence, Secure Wall, or Secure Barrier Act, the reason it was approved on a bipartisan front is because it was needed. What changed is that at one point it was wanted and needed, and now, because we call it a wall, it's immoral. Really? That's what we're talking about now? The size and width of the barrier is the delineation of what is moral or not?"\par \par \uc2 Democrats have defended their support for the 700 miles of fencing that was constructed between the United States and Mexico as different from the 2,000 miles of concrete wall the president had originally proposed (he has since amended his offer to "steel slats") and that the 2006 bill was a lesser of two evils compared with what Republicans really wanted, which was to charge any \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  as a felon.\par \par \uc2 Morgan said Trump may have called for a wall along the entire border, but no one actually believes it's needed for the entire 2,000 miles. But there are areas that remain porous, he said, that encourage illegal immigration rather than coming through legal ports of entry.\par \par \uc2 For years, Trump has portrayed the issue at the border as one of national security, but in his address to the nation, he also tried to sell it as a humanitarian crisis.\par \par \uc2 On the former, Morgan said he doesn't understand why politicians are arguing over the number of criminals or terrorists crossing the border \u8212\'20\'14 the Trump administration has been called out for claiming 4,000 terrorists were stopped at the southern border when the actual number is six. The goal, Morgan argued, shouldn't be to wait for a single terrorist to come into the country, but to be proactive so that it doesn't happen. Asked about the fact that more terrorists actually come into the country through the northern border with Canada, Morgan said issues there should be part of the conversation as well.\par \par \uc2 Morgan said he's most frustrated by how children are brought into the country illegally under perilous conditions because coyotes exploit vulnerabilities at the border. He said agents perform thousands of water rescues when families are left at a body of water that isn't safe to cross.\par \par \uc2 "I don't understand why anyone would be against developing a process that stops that from happening," he said.\par \par \uc2 Democrats have said they are willing to have a debate over border security but not while unrelated agencies are being held for ransom by the shutdown. But Morgan said the shutdown is a necessary last stand for the president to force a solution to a problem that Washington has failed to fully address for decades.\par \par \uc2 "In my heart of hearts, I truly believe we have to resolve this issue: It's in the best interest of this country," Morgan said. "We have to stop looking at the issue through our own ideological lens, setting aside our emotions, and it's not being done."\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020190109ef19007sl\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Neither President Trump's televised Oval Office address arguing for his border wall nor the rebuttal from Democratic congressional leaders appeared to move either party any closer to ending the 19-day partial government shutdown, according to the reactions of lawmakers across the political spectrum late Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 Instead, a review of dozens of written statements and interviews indicated, the parties have only become more entrenched in their positions \u8212\'20\'14 while a few wondered aloud about the point of the dueling prime-time statements carried live by the television networks.\par \par \uc2 "Nobody convinced anybody," tweeted Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan, an iconoclastic Republican, moments after the conclusion of the Democratic response from House Speaker \uc2 Nancy Pelosi\uc2  and Senate Minority Leader \uc2 Charles E. Schumer\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Their televised remarks were vivid. "How much more American blood must we shed before Congress does its job?" Trump asked, rattling off questionable facts and figures about \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  crime. "We don't govern by temper tantrum," said Schumer, demanding alongside Pelosi that Trump reopen the government.\par \par \uc2 But neither Trump nor the Democrats put forth any basis for compromise, even a kernel to spark further discussions, which are set to resume Wednesday at the White House. Instead, each party's leading voices quickly echoed their respective leaders.\par \par \uc2 Speaking on Fox News Channel's "Hannity," Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) said "the only way we lose is to give in."\par \par \uc2 "If we stand firm, put deals on the table that make sense, we will win this on behalf of the American people," he said. "But if we undercut the president, that's the end of his presidency and the end of our party, and we deserve to be punished if we give in now."\par \par \uc2 Over on MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show," superstar freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) attacked Trump's human rights record and questioned not only the border wall but the whole immigration enforcement apparatus.\par \par \uc2 "The president should not be asking for more money to an agency that has systematically violated human rights," she said, referring to \uc2 Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2 . "The president should be really defending why we are funding such an agency at all. Right now, what we are seeing is death. Right now, what we are seeing is the violation of human rights."\par \par \uc2 Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) offered a 12-minute rebuttal that was streamed live on social media networks, though not carried live on television. After dismissing Trump's border wall and lambasting the shutdown, he pivoted to other "crises" \u8212\'20\'14 climate change, economic inequality, uneven health care and rising student debt.\par \par \uc2 "We don't have to create artificial crises," he said. "We have enough real crises."\par \par \uc2 Congressional leaders were hardly more measured. House Majority Leader \uc2 Steny H. Hoyer\uc2  (D-Md.) accused Trump in a statement of having "peddled falsehoods to the American people live from the Oval Office" and stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Pelosi and Schumer in demanding the government be reopened before border negotiations take place: "This shutdown must end, and only President Trump has the power to end it."\par \par \uc2 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), meanwhile, backed Trump's claims of a "humanitarian and security crisis" at the border and said his wall proposal "suits the reality on the ground."\par \par \uc2 "The past 18 days have shown that Democrats' refusal to negotiate is not due to any principled objection, but simply due to partisan spite for the president," he said.\par \par \uc2 The messaging war is set to continue through the week. On Wednesday morning, Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Schumer (D-N.Y.) are set to appear in the Capitol with furloughed federal workers before heading to an afternoon negotiating session at the White House with Trump and Republican leaders.\par \par \uc2 On Thursday, Trump is scheduled to visit the southern border to highlight what he described as a "humanitarian crisis" in his Tuesday night address. "A crisis of the heart and a crisis of the soul," he called it.\par \par \uc2 Among the congressional rank and file, the warnings were dire and the rhetoric was occasionally apocalyptic. For Republicans, the threat was crime and drugs.\par \par \uc2 "Mexican meth is coming into Montana and destroying families across our state," said Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.), while colleague \uc2 Joni Ernst\uc2  (R-Iowa) accused Democrats of "playing games with the safety and security of each and every town in America."\par \par \uc2 "As long as border officials refer 50 migrants for medical care each day and 300 Americans are overdosing on heroin each week, there's no time for the Democrats to continue to ignore this crisis and oppose clear solutions to it," said Rep. Douglas A. Collins (R-Ga.), the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee.\par \par \uc2 Democrats, meanwhile, mainly leveled their harsh attacks on the president himself.\par \par \uc2 "Much like the TV dramas that typically air during prime time, the president's speech was fiction," said \uc2 Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto\uc2  (D-Nev.), while \uc2 Rep. Pramila Jayapal\uc2  (D-Wash.) said "Trump sounds like a broken record. He reverts to the same old script \u8212\'20\'14 demagoguery and xenophobia \u8212\'20\'14 because that's all he knows how to do."\par \par \uc2 Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) accused Trump of "seeking to protect his own ego and pander to his base," while \uc2 Sen. Patrick J. Leahy\uc2  (D-Vt.) called the address "simply fact-free fearmongering and data-distorting demagoguery."\par \par \uc2 "Let's be very clear," \uc2 Sen. Jeff Merkley\uc2  (D-Ore.) said. "The only 'crisis' at the southern border is the humanitarian crisis President Trump and his administration created by ripping babies away from their parents' arms and locking up children."\par \par \uc2 The chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, \uc2 Rep. Bennie Thompson\uc2  (D-Miss.), also slammed Trump's "fearmongering and lies" but also sought to debunk his case for the wall: "A wall will not stop the flow of illegal drugs he talks about, which overwhelmingly come through legal ports of entry. A wall is ineffective and a waste of taxpayer dollars."\par \par \uc2 "I see no indication tonight that the president is willing to negotiate in good faith," Thompson added.\par \par \uc2 More moderate lawmakers \u8212\'20\'14 who tend to be more interested in solving thorny problems like an extended shutdown \u8212\'20\'14 might have been less shrill, but they were hardly extending hands of friendship in light of Trump's address.\par \par \uc2 Sen. Thom Tillis\uc2  (R-N.C.), who has long advocated a broad immigration deal that would trade wall funding for legal status for some illegal immigrants, called for just that on Tuesday. But he said it was on Democrats to act, not the GOP: "Speaker Pelosi and Minority Leader Schumer have yet to put forward a single serious alternative to open our government and fund border security."\par \par \uc2 And Sen. Christopher A. Coons (D-Del.), an erstwhile negotiating partner of Tillis's, rejected a "costly and ineffective border wall" outright: "The president's continued insistence on building a wall along our southern border, which he justifies with misleading and even false information, is not productive and only serves to further divide our country."\par \par \uc2 mike.debonis@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 David Weigel contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020190109ef19003pd\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 President Trump delivered his first prime-time Oval Office address as president on Tuesday. It was a speech about 10 minutes long in which he addressed his demand for border wall funding that has led to a partial shutdown of the \uc2 U.S. government\uc2  for more than two weeks.\par \par \uc2 Below is the full transcript, with fact checks and annotations in yellow.\par \par \uc2 My fellow Americans, tonight I am speaking to you because there is a growing humanitarian and security crisis at our southern border. Every day, Customs and Border Patrol agents encounter thousands of illegal immigrants trying to enter our country.\par \par \uc2 We are out of space to hold them, and we have no way to promptly return them back home to their country. America proudly welcomes millions of lawful immigrants who enrich our society and contribute to our nation, but all Americans are hurt by uncontrolled illegal migration. It strains public resources and drives down jobs and wages.\par \par \uc2 Among those hardest hit are African Americans and Hispanic Americans. Our southern border is a pipeline for vast quantities of illegal drugs, including meth, heroin, cocaine and fentanyl. Every week, 300 of our citizens are killed by heroin alone, 90 percent of which floods across from our southern border. More Americans will die from drugs this year than were killed in the entire Vietnam War.\par \par \uc2 In the last two years, ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of aliens with criminal records, including those charged or convicted of 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes and 4,000 violent killings. Over the years, thousands of Americans have been brutally killed by those who illegally entered our country, and thousands more lives will be lost if we don't act right now.\par \par \uc2 This is a humanitarian crisis, a crisis of the heart and a crisis of the soul. Last month, 20,000 migrant children were illegally brought into the United States, a dramatic increase. These children are used as human pawns by vicious coyotes and ruthless gangs.\par \par \uc2 One in 3 women are sexually assaulted on the dangerous trek up through Mexico. Women and children are the biggest victims, by far, of our broken system. This is the tragic reality of illegal immigration on our southern border. This is the cycle of human suffering that I am determined to end.\par \par \uc2 My administration has presented Congress with a detailed proposal to secure the border and stop the criminal gangs, drug smugglers, and human traffickers. It's a tremendous problem. Our proposal was developed by law enforcement professionals and border agents at the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2 . These are the resources they have requested to properly perform their mission and keep America safe \u8212\'20\'14 in fact, safer than ever before.\par \par \uc2 The proposal from Homeland Security includes cutting-edge technology for detecting drugs, weapons, illegal contraband and many other things. We have requested more agents, immigration judges and bed space to process the sharp rise in unlawful migration fueled by our very strong economy.\par \par \uc2 Our plan also contains an urgent request for humanitarian assistance and medical support. Furthermore, we have asked Congress to close border security loopholes so that \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  children can be safely and humanely returned back home.\par \par \uc2 Finally, as part of an overall approach to border security, law enforcement professionals have requested $5.7 billion for a physical barrier. At the request of Democrats, it will be a steel barrier rather than a concrete wall. This barrier is absolutely critical to border security. It's also what our professionals at the border want and need.\par \par \uc2 This is just common sense. The border wall would very quickly pay for itself. The cost of illegal drugs exceeds $500 billion a year, vastly more than the $5.7 billion we have requested from Congress.\par \par \uc2 The wall will also be paid for indirectly by the great new trade deal we have made with Mexico. Senator \uc2 Chuck Schumer\uc2 , who you will be hearing from later tonight, has repeatedly supported a physical barrier in the past, along with many other Democrats. They changed their mind only after I was elected president.\par \par \uc2 Democrats in Congress have refused to acknowledge the crisis, and they have refused to provide our brave border agents with the tools they desperately need to protect our families and our nation.\par \par \uc2 The federal government remains shut down for one reason and one reason only: because Democrats will not fund border security. My administration is doing everything in our power to help those impacted by the situation, but the only solution is for Democrats to pass a spending bill that defends our borders and reopens the government.\par \par \uc2 This situation could be solved in a 45-minute meeting. I have invited congressional leadership to the White House tomorrow to get this done. Hopefully we can rise above partisan politics in order to support national security.\par \par \uc2 Some have suggested a barrier is immoral. Then why do wealthy politicians build walls, fences and gates around their homes? They don't build walls because they hate the people on the outside, but because they love the people on the inside. The only thing that is immoral is the politicians to do nothing and continue to allow more innocent people to be so horribly victimized.\par \par \uc2 America's heart broke the day after Christmas, when a young police officer in California was savagely murdered in cold blood by an illegal alien who just came across the border. The life of an American hero was stolen by someone who had no right to be in our country.\par \par \uc2 Day after day, precious lives are cut short by those who have violated our borders. In California, an Air Force veteran was raped, murdered and beaten to death with a hammer by an illegal alien with a long criminal history.\par \par \uc2 In Georgia, an illegal alien was recently charged with murder for killing, beheading and dismembering his neighbor.\par \par \uc2 In Maryland, MS-13 gang members who arrived in the United States as unaccompanied minors were arrested and charged last year after viciously stabbing and beating a 16-year-old girl.\par \par \uc2 Over the last several years, I've met with dozens of families whose loved ones were stolen by illegal immigration. I've held the hands of the weeping mothers and embraced the grief-stricken fathers. So sad. So terrible.\par \par \uc2 I will never forget the pain in their eyes, the tremble in their voices and the sadness gripping their souls. How much more American blood must we shed before Congress does its job?\par \par \uc2 To those who refuse to compromise in the name of border security, I would ask: Imagine if it was your child, your husband or your wife whose life was so cruelly shattered and totally broken?\par \par \uc2 To every member of Congress, pass a bill that ends this crisis. To every citizen, call Congress and tell them to finally, after all of these decades, secure our border. This is a choice between right and wrong, justice and injustice. This is about whether we fulfill our sacred duty to the American citizens we serve.\par \par \uc2 When I took the oath of office, I swore to protect our country, and that is what I will always do, so help me God. Thank you, and good night.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020190109ef19001md\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved \par \par \uc2 Following are the transcripts of President Trump's address to the nation from the Oval Office on Tuesday night, and the response from Capitol Hill by House Speaker \uc2 Nancy Pelosi\uc2  and Senate Minority Leader \uc2 Charles E. Schumer\uc2 :\par \par \uc2 PRESIDENT TRUMP:\par \par \uc2 My Fellow Americans.\par \par \uc2 Tonight I am speaking to you because there is a growing humanitarian and security crisis at our southern border. Every day Customs and Border Patrol agents encounter thousands of illegal immigrants trying to enter our country.\par \par \uc2 We are out of space to hold them, and we have no way to promptly return them back home to their country.\par \par \uc2 America proudly welcomes millions of lawful immigrants who enrich our society and contribute to our nation, but all Americans are hurt by uncontrolled illegal migration. It strains public resources and drives down jobs and wages.\par \par \uc2 Among those hardest hit are African Americans and Hispanic Americans. Our southern border is a pipeline for vast quantities of illegal drugs, including meth, heroin, cocaine and fentanyl. Every week, 300 of our citizens are killed by heroin alone, 90 percent of which floods across from our southern border. More Americans will die from drugs this year than were killed in the entire Vietnam War.\par \par \uc2 In the last two years, ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of aliens with criminal records, including those charged or convicted of 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes and 4,000 violent killings. Over the years, thousands of Americans have been brutally killed by those who illegally entered our country, and thousands more lives will be lost if we don't act right now.\par \par \uc2 This is a humanitarian crisis, a crisis of the heart and a crisis of the soul. Last month, 20,000 migrant children were illegally brought into the United States, a dramatic increase. These children are used as human pawns by vicious coyotes and ruthless gangs.\par \par \uc2 One in three women are sexually assaulted on the dangerous trek up through Mexico. Women and children are the biggest victims, by far, of our broken system. This is the tragic reality of illegal immigration on our southern border. This is the cycle of human suffering that I am determined to end.\par \par \uc2 My administration has presented Congress with a detailed proposal to secure the border and stop the criminal gangs, drug smugglers and human traffickers. It's a tremendous problem. Our proposal was developed by law enforcement professionals and border agents at the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2 . These are the resources they have requested to properly perform their mission and keep America safe - in fact, safer than ever before.\par \par \uc2 The proposal from Homeland Security includes cutting-edge technology for detecting drugs, weapons, illegal contraband and many other things. We have requested more agents, immigration judges and bed space to process the sharp rise in unlawful migration fueled by our very strong economy.\par \par \uc2 Our plan also contains an urgent request for humanitarian assistance and medical support. Furthermore, we have asked Congress to close border security loopholes so that \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  children can be safely and humanely returned back home.\par \par \uc2 Finally, as part of an overall approach to border security, law enforcement professionals have requested $5.7 billion for a physical barrier. At the request of Democrats, it will be a steel barrier rather than a concrete wall. This barrier is absolutely critical to border security. It's also what our professionals at the border want and need.\par \par \uc2 This is just common sense. The border wall would very quickly pay for itself. The cost of illegal drugs exceeds $500 billion a year, vastly more than the $5.7 billion we have requested from Congress.\par \par \uc2 The wall will also be paid for indirectly by the great new trade deal we have made with Mexico. Senator \uc2 Chuck Schumer\uc2 , who you will be hearing from later tonight, has repeatedly supported a physical barrier in the past, along with many other Democrats. They changed their mind only after I was elected president.\par \par \uc2 Democrats in Congress have refused to acknowledge the crisis, and they have refused to provide our brave border agents with the tools they desperately need to protect our families and our nation.\par \par \uc2 The federal government remains shut down for one reason and one reason only: Because Democrats will not fund border security. My administration is doing everything in our power to help those impacted by the situation, but the only solution is for Democrats to pass a spending bill that defends our borders and reopens the government.\par \par \uc2 This situation could be solved in a 45-minute meeting. I have invited congressional leadership to the White House tomorrow to get this done. Hopefully we can rise above partisan politics in order to support national security.\par \par \uc2 Some have suggested a barrier is immoral. Then why do wealthy politicians build walls, fences and gates around their homes? They don't build walls because they hate the people on the outside, but because they love the people on the inside. The only thing that is immoral is the politicians to do nothing and continue to allow more innocent people to be so horribly victimized.\par \par \uc2 America's heart broke the day after Christmas when a young police officer in California was savagely murdered in cold blood by an illegal alien who just came across the border. The life of an American hero was stolen by someone who had no right to be in our country.\par \par \uc2 Day after day, precious lives are cut short by those who have violated our borders. In California, an Air Force veteran was raped, murdered and beaten to death with a hammer by an illegal alien with a long criminal history.\par \par \uc2 In Georgia, an illegal alien was recently charged with murder for killing, beheading and dismembering his neighbor.\par \par \uc2 In Maryland, MS-13 gang members who arrived in the United States as unaccompanied minors were arrested and charged last year after viciously stabbing and beating a 16-year-old girl.\par \par \uc2 Over the last several years, I've met with dozens of families whose loved ones were stolen by illegal immigration. I've held the hands of the weeping mothers and embraced the grief-stricken fathers. So sad. So terrible.\par \par \uc2 I will never forget the pain in their eyes, the tremble in their voices, and the sadness gripping their souls. How much more American blood must we shed before Congress does its job?\par \par \uc2 To those who refuse to compromise in the name of border security, I would ask: Imagine if it was your child, your husband, or your wife whose life was so cruelly shattered and totally broken?\par \par \uc2 To every member of Congress, pass a bill that ends this crisis. To every citizen, call Congress and tell them to finally, after all of these decades, secure our border. This is a choice between right and wrong, justice and injustice. This is about whether we fulfill our sacred duty to the American citizens we serve.\par \par \uc2 When I took the oath of office, I swore to protect our country, and that is what I will always do, so help me God. Thank you, and good night.\par \par \uc2 NANCY PELOSI\uc2 :\par \par \uc2 Good evening. I appreciate the opportunity to speak directly to the American people tonight about how we can end this shutdown and meet the needs of the American people.\par \par \uc2 Sadly, much of what we heard from President Trump throughout this senseless shutdown has been full of misinformation and even malice.\par \par \uc2 The president has chosen fear. We want to start with the facts.\par \par \uc2 The fact is, on the very first day of this Congress, House Democrats passed Senate Republican legislation to reopen government and fund smart, effective border security solutions.\par \par \uc2 But the president is rejecting these bipartisan bills, which would reopen government, over his obsession with forcing American taxpayers to waste billions of dollars on an expensive and ineffective wall, a wall he always promised Mexico would pay for.\par \par \uc2 The fact is, President Trump has chosen to hold hostage critical services for the health, safety and well-being of the American people and withhold the paychecks of 800,000 innocent workers across the nation, many of them veterans.\par \par \uc2 He promised to keep government shut down for "months or years," no matter whom it hurts. That's just plain wrong.\par \par \uc2 The fact is, we all agree we need to secure our borders, while honoring our values. We can build the infrastructure and roads at our ports of entry. We can install new technology to scan cars and trucks for drugs coming into our nation. We can hire the personnel we need to facilitate trade and immigration at the border. We can fund more innovation to detect unauthorized crossings.\par \par \uc2 The fact is, the women and children at the border are not a security threat. They are a humanitarian challenge, a challenge that President Trump's own cruel and counterproductive policies have only deepened.\par \par \uc2 And the fact is, President Trump must stop holding the American people hostage, must stop manufacturing a crisis, and must reopen the government.\par \par \uc2 Thank you.\par \par \uc2 Leader Schumer?\par \par \uc2 CHARLES E. SCHUMER\uc2 :\par \par \uc2 Thank you, Speaker Pelosi.\par \par \uc2 My fellow Americans, we address you tonight for one reason only: The president of the United States, having failed to get Mexico to pay for his ineffective, unnecessary border wall, and unable to convince the Congress or the American people to foot the bill, has shut down the government.\par \par \uc2 American democracy doesn't work that way. We don't govern by temper tantrum. No president should pound the table and demand he gets his way or else the government shuts down, hurting millions of Americans who are treated as leverage.\par \par \uc2 Tonight - and throughout this debate and throughout his presidency - President Trump has appealed to fear, not facts, division, not unity.\par \par \uc2 Make no mistake. Democrats and the president both want stronger border security. However, we sharply disagree with the president about the most effective way to do it.\par \par \uc2 So how do we untangle this mess?\par \par \uc2 Well, there's an obvious solution: Separate the shutdown from arguments over border security. There is bipartisan legislation - supported by Democrats and Republicans - to reopen government while allowing debate over border security to continue.\par \par \uc2 There is no excuse for hurting millions of Americans over a policy difference. Federal workers are about to miss a paycheck. Some families can't get a mortgage to buy a new home. Farmers and small businesses won't get loans they desperately need.\par \par \uc2 Most presidents have used Oval Office addresses for noble purposes. This president just used the backdrop of the Oval Office to manufacture a crisis, stoke fear and divert attention from the turmoil in his administration.\par \par \uc2 My fellow Americans, there is no challenge so great that our nation cannot rise to meet it. We can reopen the government and continue to work through disagreements over policy. We can secure our border without an ineffective, expensive wall. And we can welcome legal immigrants and refugees without compromising safety and security.\par \par \uc2 The symbol of America should be the Statue of Liberty, not a 30-foot wall.\par \par \uc2 So our suggestion is a simple one: Mr. President, reopen the government and we can work to resolve our differences over border security.\par \par \uc2 But end this shutdown now.\par \par \uc2 Thank you.\par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com\par \par \uc2 WP20190109speechtext0109\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020190109ef190002h\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

Leonnig \par \uc2 1,293 \uc2 words\par \uc2 4 January 2019\par \uc2 The Washington Post\par \uc2 WP\par \uc2 FINAL\par A07\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2019, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved \par \par \uc2 A former kitchen employee at one of President Trump's golf clubs in New Jersey said her superiors kept her name and those of other undocumented workers off a list of people to be vetted by the Secret Service before a Trump visit to the club in 2016.\par \par \uc2 Emma Torres, 43, an immigrant from Ecuador, said that she informed a human resources official at the club that she did not have papers to live legally in the United States when she was asked to submit her information for a clearance check. She said the names of undocumented workers were then excised from a list turned over to the Secret Service.\par \par \uc2 Torres could not recall the name of the person who modified the list or the exact date of the incident. But she said she continued in her job at the club and was later working in the kitchen when Trump visited the club under Secret Service protection.\par \par \uc2 Torres's account, first reported by the \uc2 New York Times\uc2 , suggests that the presence of undocumented workers at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J., was known by at least some managers. Last month, several women went public to say that they worked at the club without legal immigration status.\par \par \uc2 Trump Organization\uc2  officials and White House officials declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 The presence of undocumented workers at one of the president's signature golf clubs stands in sharp juxtaposition to his staunch rhetoric against illegal immigration. Since launching his White House bid, Trump has vowed to build a border wall with Mexico to keep out undocumented migrants, accusing them of bringing drugs and crime into the country. His demand for more than $5 billion to build the wall has led to the ongoing partial shutdown of the federal government.\par \par \uc2 During his presidential campaign, Trump touted his company's hiring practices. In the fall of 2016, when he opened a new Trump hotel in Washington, he told the assembled audience: "We didn't have one \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  on the job. Everybody knows it."\par \par \uc2 Anibal Romero, a Newark-based immigration attorney, said he now represents five immigrants who say they had worked at Trump's Bedminster club without legal status in recent years. Investigators with the \uc2 FBI\uc2  and the New Jersey attorney general's office have collected employment documents on his clients in recent months, he said, an indication that the agencies may be scrutinizing the hiring practices of the president's club.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, Torres's experience and that of another worker suggest that the Secret Service may not have had a full picture of who was in proximity to Trump and his guests when they visited the Bedminster club.\par \par \uc2 Victorina Morales, 45, an undocumented immigrant from Guatemala who said she worked as a housekeeper cleaning Trump's villa, said Secret Service agents gave her a pin to wear every time Trump visited.\par \par \uc2 "I had to wear the pin to get into the golf club," Morales said in an interview Thursday. Morales said she recalls one pin having an American flag and another with a design that she did not recall.\par \par \uc2 Secret Service spokeswoman Catherine Milhoan said a Secret Service pin bearing the U.S. flag is a novelty item and "is not used by the Secret Service as a means of identification, verification or access control." She declined to discuss what kind of pins agents may have provided Morales.\par \par \uc2 Official pins indicating someone has permission to enter secure areas have other designs; they are provided to venue staffers by the Secret Service only after a background check, according to former officials.\par \par \uc2 It is unclear whether Morales received such a screening. She said she did not recall being asked to submit her information in advance but said she assumed her supervisor provided it.\par \par \uc2 "If that person got a pin without being screened, that's a serious violation of the protocol," according to a person familiar with the Secret Service screening process who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.\par \par \uc2 Milhoan said the agency "does not comment on our protective operations, including the administration of our name-check program." She declined to say whether officials ever screened Morales or Torres for a Trump visit to the Bedminster club.\par \par \uc2 The revelations about undocumented workers at Bedminster surfaced publicly in the Times last month, when Morales and Sandra Diaz, a 46-year-old Costa Rican native, said they were hired by the New Jersey club despite their lack of legal immigration status.\par \par \uc2 Morales said Thursday that she told a supervisor when she applied for the housekeeping job in 2013 that she did not have proper immigration papers to work legally in the United States. She recalled being told: "It's no problem here. You don't need papers."\par \par \uc2 Romero, her attorney, provided The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2  with payroll and tax documents from recent years that list her employment at the Bedminster golf course.\par \par \uc2 Trump Organization\uc2  officials have repeatedly declined to address the specific allegations by the workers. Last month, spokeswoman Amanda Miller said in a statement: "We have tens of thousands of employees across our properties and have very strict hiring practices. If any employee submitted false documentation in an attempt to circumvent the law, they will be terminated immediately."\par \par \uc2 A person close to the organization said an internal investigation of claims made by former workers at Bedminster produced no credible information to support a range of allegations they made, including that managers were aware of employees without legal status.\par \par \uc2 Torres said she began working at the club in early 2015 doing housekeeping and then moved to the kitchen staff, first as a dishwasher and later in food preparation, earning $14.50 per hour. She said she got the job with a fake Social Security number.\par \par \uc2 Morales said she worked with Torres in housekeeping and said she recalled her transferring to the kitchen staff.\par \par \uc2 Trump visited Bedminster at least a half-dozen times during the 2016 campaign, according to news coverage of his travel. Around the time he became the Republican nominee, Torres said, security got tighter at the golf club, particularly when he was visiting.\par \par \uc2 For presidential candidates under Secret Service protection, the agency seeks to check the backgrounds and criminal records of anyone who will be in proximity to the candidate at events.\par \par \uc2 At one point, Secret Service agents arrived at the Bedminster club and kitchen supervisors asked all kitchen staffers to put their names, ages and Social Security numbers on a list, Torres said.\par \par \uc2 Torres said she and other undocumented employees gave their information but then grew concerned that it would be used to discover their immigration status.\par \par \uc2 She said she grabbed a golf cart and drove to an administrative office, where she asked a human resources employee to remove her name from the list. When asked why, she recalled, she said: "Because I'm undocumented. I don't have papers."\par \par \uc2 Torres said the human resources official agreed to take her and several other undocumented Hispanics off the list. "She took a pen and crossed it out," she said. "She crossed out our names."\par \par \uc2 Torres said she was later working at the club on occasions when Trump visited. At times, Secret Service agents who accompanied him were Hispanic, Torres said, and the kitchen staffers would chat with them in Spanish.\par \par \uc2 Torres said she left her job in Bedminster in 2017 because she felt uncomfortable as a woman in a mostly male kitchen. She also said she did not like Trump's comments about immigrants.\par \par \uc2 joshua.partlow@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 tom.hamburger@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 carol.leonnig@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 Alice Crites contributed to this report. \par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com\par \par \uc2 WP20190104bedminster0104\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020190104ef1400005\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 A former kitchen employee at one of President Trump's golf clubs in New Jersey said her superiors kept her name and those of other undocumented workers off a list of people to be vetted by the Secret Service before a Trump visit to the club in 2016.\par \par \uc2 Emma Torres, 43, an immigrant from Ecuador, said that she informed a human resources official at the club that she did not have papers to live legally in the United States when she was asked to submit her information for a clearance check. She said the names of undocumented workers were then excised from a list turned over to the Secret Service.\par \par \uc2 Torres could not recall the name of the person who modified the list or the exact date of the incident. But she said she continued in her job at the club and was later working in the kitchen when Trump visited the club under Secret Service protection.\par \par \uc2 Torres's account, first reported by the \uc2 New York Times\uc2 , suggests that the presence of undocumented workers at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J., was known by at least some managers. Last month, several women went public to say that they worked at the club without legal immigration status.\par \par \uc2 Trump Organization\uc2  officials and White House officials declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 The presence of undocumented workers at one of the president's signature golf clubs stands in sharp juxtaposition to his staunch rhetoric against illegal immigration. Since launching his White House bid, Trump has vowed to build a border wall with Mexico to keep out undocumented migrants, accusing them of bringing drugs and crime into the country. His demand for more than $5\u160\'00\'A0billion to build the wall has led to the ongoing partial shutdown of the federal government.\par \par \uc2 During his presidential campaign, Trump touted his company's hiring practices. In the fall of 2016, when he opened a new Trump hotel in Washington, he told the assembled audience: "We didn't have one \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  on the job. Everybody knows it."\par \par \uc2 Anibal Romero, a Newark-based immigration attorney, said he now represents five immigrants who say they had worked at Trump's Bedminster club without legal status in recent years. Investigators with the \uc2 FBI\uc2  and the New Jersey attorney general's office have collected employment documents on his clients in recent months, he said, an indication that the agencies may be scrutinizing the hiring practices of the president's club.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, Torres's experience and that of another worker suggest that the Secret Service may not have had a full picture of who was in proximity to Trump and his guests when they visited the Bedminster club.\par \par \uc2 Victorina Morales, 45, an undocumented immigrant from Guatemala who said she worked as a housekeeper in a different part of the club cleaning Trump's villa, said Secret Service agents gave her a pin to wear every time Trump visited.\par \par \uc2 "I had to wear the pin to get into the golf club," Morales said in an interview Thursday.\par \par \uc2 Her supervisor asked her to sign her name to receive a pin, but Morales said she explained that she did not know how to write, so she didn't sign. "I told them I couldn't write, so they let me go at that," she said.\par \par \uc2 Morales said she recalls one pin having an American flag and another with a design that she did not recall.\par \par \uc2 Secret Service spokeswoman Catherine Milhoan said a Secret Service pin bearing the U.S. flag is a novelty item and "is not used by the Secret Service as a means of identification, verification or access control." She declined to discuss what kind of pins agents may have provided Morales.\par \par \uc2 Official pins indicating someone has permission to enter secure areas have other designs; they are provided to venue staffers by the Secret Service only after a background check, according to former officials.\par \par \uc2 It is unclear whether Morales received such a screening. She said she did not recall being asked to submit her information in advance but said she assumed her supervisor provided it.\par \par \uc2 "If that person got a pin without being screened, that's a serious violation of the protocol," according to a person familiar with the Secret Service screening process who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.\par \par \uc2 Milhoan said the agency "does not comment on our protective operations, including the administration of our name-check program." She declined to say whether officials ever screened Morales or Torres for a Trump visit to the Bedminster club.\par \par \uc2 The revelations about undocumented workers at Bedminster surfaced publicly in the Times last month, when Morales and Sandra Diaz, a 46-year-old Costa Rican native, said they were hired by the New Jersey club despite their lack of legal immigration status.\par \par \uc2 Morales said Thursday that she told a Bedminster supervisor when she applied for the housekeeping job in 2013 that she did not have proper immigration papers to work legally in the United States. She recalled being told: "It's no problem here. You don't need papers."\par \par \uc2 "They knew I didn't have good papers," said Morales, who worked at the club until last month. Romero, her attorney, provided The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2  with payroll and tax documents from recent years that list her employment at the Bedminster golf course.\par \par \uc2 Trump Organization\uc2  officials have repeatedly declined to address the specific allegations by the workers. Last month, spokeswoman Amanda Miller said in a statement: "We have tens of thousands of employees across our properties and have very strict hiring practices. If any employee submitted false documentation in an attempt to circumvent the law, they will be terminated immediately."\par \par \uc2 A person close to the organization said that an internal investigation of claims made by former workers at Bedminster produced no credible information to support a range of allegations they made, including that managers were aware of employees without legal status.\par \par \uc2 Torres said she began working at the club in early 2015 doing housekeeping and then moved to the kitchen staff, first as a dishwasher and later in food preparation, earning $14.50 per hour. She said she got the job with a fake Social Security number.\par \par \uc2 Morales said she worked with Torres in housekeeping and said she recalled her transferring to the kitchen staff.\par \par \uc2 Trump visited Bedminster at least a half-dozen times during the 2016 campaign, according to news coverage of his travel. Around the time he became the Republican nominee, Torres said, security got tighter at the golf club, particularly when he was visiting.\par \par \uc2 For presidential candidates under Secret Service protection, the agency seeks to check the backgrounds and criminal records of anyone who will be in proximity to the candidate at events. Agents from a local field office who are preparing for a candidate visit require the management of the venue hosting the visit \u8212\'20\'14 whether it is a hotel, a convention center or a golf club \u8212\'20\'14 to provide, several days before, the names of all employees who will prepare food, entertain or wait on the candidate.\par \par \uc2 The Secret Service's protective intelligence division then runs those names through a national \uc2 FBI\uc2  database to determine whether anyone is wanted for a bench warrant or has any history of arrests or convictions for drugs or violent crimes.\par \par \uc2 At one point, Secret Service agents arrived at the Bedminster club and kitchen supervisors asked all kitchen staffers to put their names, ages and Social Security numbers on a list, Torres said. She said she could not recall exactly when that occurred.\par \par \uc2 Torres said she and other undocumented employees gave their information but then grew concerned that it would be used to discover their immigration status.\par \par \uc2 She said she grabbed a golf cart and drove to an administrative office, where she asked a human resources employee to remove her name from the list. When asked why, she recalled, she said: "Because I'm undocumented. I don't have papers."\par \par \uc2 Torres said the human resources official agreed to take her and several other undocumented Hispanics off the list.\par \par \uc2 "She took a pen and crossed it out," she said. "She crossed out our names."\par \par \uc2 Torres said she was later working at the club on occasions when Trump visited. At times, Secret Service agents who accompanied him were Hispanic, Torres said, and the kitchen staffers would chat with them in Spanish.\par \par \uc2 Torres said she left her job in Bedminster in 2017 because she felt uncomfortable as a woman in a mostly male kitchen. She said she was also stressed out by the intensity of working during Trump visits, when she would arrive at 8 a.m. but often not leave until late at night. She also said she did not like Trump's comments about immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Her experience with Trump personally, she added, was not unpleasant. At one point, she recalled, he shook her hand and told her she was doing a good job, before giving her a $50 tip.\par \par \uc2 joshua.partlow@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 tom.hamburger@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 carol.leonnig@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 Alice Crites contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020190104ef14000gq\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) said that Democratic leaders in Congress have "American blood" on their hands by not providing funding for a proposed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\par \par \uc2 President Trump has requested $5 billion in funding for the wall \u8212\'20\'14 which he has called integral for border security \u8212\'20\'14 prompting a partial government shutdown that began Dec. 22. The president has continued to push for the wall, tweeting Monday morning that the border has long been an "'Open Wound' where drugs, criminals (including human traffickers) and illegals" could enter the United States.\par \par \uc2 In an interview with WAAY Tv, Brooks, a representative for Alabama's 5th Congressional District, took Trump's sentiment a step further. He specifically blamed presumptive House speaker \uc2 Nancy Pelosi\uc2  (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader \uc2 Charles E. Schumer\uc2  (D-N.Y.) for the deaths of "thousands" of Americans each year because of illegal immigrants. He did not offer facts or statistics to support his claim.\par \par \uc2 "It's a very tough position that the Democrats have put us in. One the one hand, you've got thousands of Americans who are dead each year because the Democrats' refusal to secure our borders. Those Americans are dying either because they've been murdered by illegal aliens, vehicular homicides by illegal aliens, or the illegal narcotics that are shipped into our country by illegal aliens and their drug cartels with the drug overdoses that are in the tens of thousands of lost American lives per year."\par \par \uc2 "The question's going to be, how much American blood do you have to have on the hands of Democrat leaders like \uc2 Nancy Pelosi\uc2  and \uc2 Chuck Schumer\uc2  before they will help us with border security? Or is their craving for power such that they're willing to accept the loss of American life."\par \par \uc2 A call to Brooks's office was not returned Monday afternoon, and a recording indicated its voice mail box was full. An email sent to his spokesman requesting more information on Brooks's claims was not immediately returned.\par \par \uc2 In June, The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2 's Philip Bump reported that data shows immigrants \u8212\'20\'14 including those who enter the country illegally \u8212\'20\'14 commit crimes at lower rates than native-born Americans. Trump has rejected that idea.\par \par \uc2 The full context of the question that sparked Brooks's response wasn't immediately clear. In December, Schumer and Pelosi met with Trump in an Oval Office meeting, where Trump said a wall "totally solves the problem" of border security.\par \par \uc2 "Yes, we need border security. The wall is a part of border security. You can't have very border security without the wall," Trump said during the meeting.\par \par \uc2 Last week, California authorities announced the arrest of a suspect and seven others in connection with the shooting death of a California police officer, Ronil Singh. The man charged with shooting Singh, Gustavo Perez Arriaga, had entered the United States illegally, police say, adding fuel to debates about sanctuary laws and immigration.\par \par \uc2 Trump tweeted about the case amid authorities' full-scale manhunt for Perez Arriaga, writing: "There is right now a full scale manhunt going on in California for an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  accused of shooting and killing a police officer during a traffic stop. Time to get tough on Border Security.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The U.S. soldier was ready to deploy across the world at a moment's notice, but when the orders came down weeks ago to mobilize on the southern border, it sparked a flash of concern.\par \par \uc2 He knew the mission was in support of border agents combing harsh borderland terrain to arrest anyone unlawfully in the country.\par \par \uc2 People like him.\par \par \uc2 "I'm an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 ," the Chinese-born soldier told The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2  by phone.\par \par \uc2 His duties do not often intersect with Customs and Border Protection agents, he said, but he has avoided them out of fear they will learn that one of 5,400 troops in their orbit is in violation of immigration law.\par \par \uc2 That has placed him in the unusual situation of serving a nation that has not recognized him as a citizen, despite promises from the Pentagon to quickly naturalize skilled immigrants in exchange for service, as they had done for thousands of troops since 2009.\par \par \uc2 The Post is withholding the soldier's name and certain details, including his duty location, because he fears discipline for speaking to the media.\par \par \uc2 The soldier, now in his late 20s, began his path to the United States nearly a decade ago, after high school.\par \par \uc2 His home in southeastern China is beautiful, he said, the region dotted with lakes and towering limestone karst formations. But it is also stifling. He felt trapped by family expectations, and a passion for engineering could take him only so far there.\par \par \uc2 There were better opportunities in America, he believed.\par \par \uc2 He joined his sister in California on a student visa and enrolled in college. The military seemed like a place to further his career, he said, and the Pentagon's immigrant recruit program guaranteed something more than job security: "A sense of pride," he said.\par \par \uc2 His enlistment would also harness something that makes him especially valuable to the military \u8212\'20\'14 his voice. He speaks Mandarin Chinese, which is among several languages the Pentagon has deemed strategically vital but in short supply among U.S.-born troops.\par \par \uc2 And as the Pentagon has increasingly worried about China's military ambitions, it seemed like the perfect time, then, for the Chinese-born soldier to offer his skills. He was scheduled to begin training in August 2016, according to documents obtained by The Post.\par \par \uc2 That's about when everything started to go very wrong. The Pentagon program he enlisted through, Military Accessions Vital to the National Interest, was beginning its year-long implosion.\par \par \uc2 Immigrant recruits commonly timed their enlistment so their student and visitor visas could carry them through with enough time to legally protect them. The Chinese soldier enlisted when he was still a lawful immigrant with a valid visa \u8212\'20\'14 in compliance with MAVNI requirements.\par \par \uc2 But the Pentagon's security screening was so slow that "some number of 4,300 MAVNI applicants" had fallen out of lawful status as they waited, according to an internal agency memo dated Sept. 30, 2016.\par \par \uc2 The agency later said the number crested at 1,000 recruits. That number included the Chinese soldier, whose enlistment date slid back amid the chaos. Many recruits waited months, or years, to move forward.\par \par \uc2 The Chinese soldier did not even have weeks. In September 2016, the Pentagon introduced vastly more complicated security checks amid fears of foreign infiltrators.\par \par \uc2 Weeks later, in October, his legal status expired, making him an unlawful immigrant.\par \par \uc2 He picked up fares as a Lyft driver while he waited for his enlistment to move forward, he said, and took pains to avoid the border when he ventured to San Diego. He wouldn't risk flying, either.\par \par \uc2 In August 2017, after nine grueling months under threat of deportation, he was granted deferred action by \uc2 Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS)\uc2 , but that already expired, he said, putting him back into the crosshairs of immigration enforcement.\par \par \uc2 The MAVNI program was shuttered last fall, crushed by its own bureaucratic inertia, and remaining applicants in the system trickled through enlistment.\par \par \uc2 Military naturalizations plummeted just as the Chinese soldier readied for training, and USCIS closed its offices at three basic training sites in January 2018, \uc2 BuzzFeed\uc2  reported.\par \par \uc2 The agency said it did so after rule changes mandated 180 days of service to naturalize. In response, it moved to a roving model to perform naturalization services, though it did not say how troops like the Chinese soldier could fall through the cracks.\par \par \uc2 Congress mandated faster naturalizations established after a U.S. soldier from Trinidad was killed in Iraq on his way to gather paperwork for his citizenship. A Pentagon spokeswoman did not return a request for comment on how and why immigrant troops may arrive at their units without being naturalized.\par \par \uc2 Soon after the January closures, the Chinese soldier made it to basic training.\par \par \uc2 His drill sergeants told him he would not be naturalized during basic training in Missouri, he said.\par \par \uc2 He then moved to advanced training in Texas. He said he was told the base was not set up for naturalizations, either.\par \par \uc2 And then, soon after he arrived at his home station, he was mobilized for the border deployment.\par \par \uc2 In China, his parents have worried about his status and his safety after seeing images of Central American migrants fleeing tear gas. He feels sympathetic to fellow immigrants, he said, who like him left their home to pursue opportunities elsewhere.\par \par \uc2 "At the same time," he said, "a massive group rushing in wasn't the best way to do so, I think."\par \par \uc2 At his new unit, he said paperwork for his naturalization was underway but that the border deployment has paused the process while he is gone.\par \par \uc2 Troops on the border were scheduled to leave by Dec. 15. But on Tuesday, the Pentagon extended forces there to the end of January, leaving him more time to ponder the risks of interacting with federal agents there.\par \par \uc2 He has kept busy in his down time by working out, reading and studying for certification tests on his smartphone, he said.\par \par \uc2 Sometimes he will catch a sunset of brilliant orange and pink.\par \par \uc2 It's wondrous out there, he said, in the big, beautiful country not quite his home.\par \par \uc2 This story has been updated.\par \par \uc2 Read More:\par \par \uc2 Inmates posing as women online blackmailed hundreds of troops in 'sextortion' scheme\par \par \uc2 Pentagon identifies Special Operations troops killed in Afghanistan\par \par \uc2 A woman's daring escape from a Border Patrol agent helped reveal a 'serial killer,' police say\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020181205eec500b9l\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Metro\par {\*\bkmkstart toc32}{\*\bkmkend toc32}\b \uc2 Va. 10th could go blue again\b0\par\par\uc2 Jenna Portnoy \par \uc2 1,839 \uc2 words\par \uc2 2 November 2018\par \uc2 The Washington Post\par \uc2 WP\par \uc2 FINAL\par B05\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2018, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved \par \par \uc2 In a Northern Virginia swing district that is one of the most watched in this midterm election, one-quarter of the electorate can't really say what they think of state Sen. Jennifer Wexton. But in most polls, the Democrat is comfortably ahead of \uc2 Rep. Barbara Comstock\uc2 , the two-term Republican who is ubiquitous.\par \par \uc2 That phenomenon says plenty about this particular moment in this particular suburban district across the river from Washington, heavy with college-educated, affluent voters and growing immigrant communities. Voters in Virginia's 10th Congressional District say they want to vote for a Democrat - any Democrat - as a check on President Trump.\par \par \uc2 Johannah MacBain, a 38-year-old public school teacher, couldn't remember if she had voted for Comstock in 2016, but she said Trump's election has propelled her to vote for Wexton. Asked why, she said, "If I'm going to be really honest here, [it's] that she's not \uc2 Barbara Comstock\uc2 ."\par \par \uc2 But if anyone can withstand a blue wave, it's Comstock, her supporters say. She has stayed closely connected to community groups throughout her sprawling district and is a tenacious campaigner. \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  swept her district in 2016 by 10 percentage points but Comstock survived, and when the dust cleared, she had outperformed Trump by 16 points.\par \par \uc2 "She is going to win again. Because she's \uc2 Barbara Comstock\uc2 . She has her own brand. She's tough!" said John Fredericks, a conservative radio host and Trump loyalist.\par \par \uc2 Wexton has run a cautious campaign, trying to avoid any fumbles that could jeopardize Democrats' chances to flip a district that has been in Republican hands for nearly 40 years. A lack of a bold message may be why one out of every four voters said they didn't have an opinion of her as recently as early October.\par \par \uc2 "She's competent, she's experienced, she's not going to cause any unforced errors," said former Virginia congressman Jim Moran, a Democrat who recently hosted a fundraiser for her.\par \par \uc2 Wexton's campaign boils down to this: Comstock has voted with Trump 98 percent of the time. Republicans want to destroy your health care. Only Democrats can enact gun control. Her ads call the congresswoman "Barbara Trumpstock."\par \par \uc2 Comstock says she is running as an independent who breaks with Trump when necessary, cares about federal employees and worked to combat sexual harassment. She has embraced the slogan "results, not resistance" and said the vast majority of votes she has cast also had support of at least a few Democrats, including four to address the opioid crisis and 11 to cut government red tape.\par \par \uc2 "These are good policies that are making our country stronger economically, stronger [on] national security and a safer place to live, that people should be embracing [and] not resisting," she said on Fredericks' radio show.\par \par \uc2 The sprawling district contains the affluent, neatly manicured communities of McLean and Ashburn and the liberal enclaves in parts of Loudoun County as well as red, rural stretches of the Shenandoah Valley where voters applaud the president.\par \par \uc2 'A very good prosecutor'\par \par \uc2 Wexton, 50, grew up in Bethesda and earned a bachelor's degree at the University of Maryland and a law degree at William and Mary. From 2001 to 2005, she worked as an assistant commonwealth's attorney in Loudoun County, where she tried cases concerning homicide and domestic abuse.\par \par \uc2 She prosecuted high-profile cases, including the 2002 trial of Clara Jane Schwartz, a college student sentenced to 48 years in prison for orchestrating her father's slaying.\par \par \uc2 "You want to put your A-team on a case like Schwartz," said Tom Mulrine, a lawyer who worked alongside Wexton. "It took a very good prosecutor, a very good prosecutor."\par \par \uc2 The National Republican Congressional Committee seized on Wexton's work in a TV ad that accused her of reducing charges against violent criminals, "even the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who abducted and raped his victim four times."\par \par \uc2 The ad cites two cases where Wexton dropped charges as part of plea bargains, among hundreds of cases she handled.\par \par \uc2 "It's another example of \uc2 Barbara Comstock\uc2  distorting and falsifying my record," Wexton said. "I'm the only person in this race who has put violent criminals in prison."\par \par \uc2 She also served as a court-appointed attorney representing children in abuse and neglect cases, among other duties, as well as serving as a substitute judge in Loudoun in 2010.\par \par \uc2 She stepped down the following year to challenge Loudoun Commonwealth's Attorney Jim Plowman. She lost by about 2,000 votes out of 50,000 votes cast.\par \par \uc2 She had an easier time in back-to-back state Senate races. She won a 2014 special election for the seat \uc2 Mark Herring\uc2  vacated to serve as attorney general and won a full term the next year.\par \par \uc2 In three sessions in Richmond, she has sponsored more than 40 bills that became law, including measures to increase oversight of day-care centers, make it easier for victims of revenge porn to sue, and allow community groups to dispense naloxone, a drug used to treat an opioid overdose.\par \par \uc2 Rebecca Geller of Fairfax Station got to know Wexton in 2015 after a store clerk told Geller to stop breast-feeding her baby. Virginia was one of only three states at the time that didn't protect breast-feeding mothers.\par \par \uc2 Geller left the store and immediately started a push for a law to protect breast-feeding in public. She said Wexton's personal lobbying of her colleagues, especially Republicans, helped calm conservatives worried that it would infringe on the rights of businesses. The bill passed unanimously.\par \par \uc2 "She made it really clear if I'm putting my name on something I'm going to work really hard to get it through," said Geller, who has hosted an open house for Wexton and plans to vote for her.\par \par \uc2 #MeToo in the 10th\par \par \uc2 At a Sterling community festival last month, MacBain, the public school teacher, said she was casting her vote for Wexton as a protest against Comstock and ticked off a list of grievances: Comstock won't hold town halls. She only does photo ops.\par \par \uc2 And then she got to the issue that she felt most strongly about: Comstock's support for the nomination of \uc2 Brett M. Kavanaugh\uc2  to the \uc2 U.S. Supreme Court\uc2 , after he was accused of sexually assaulting Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.\par \par \uc2 "That tells me all I need to know," MacBain said.\par \par \uc2 For MacBain and voters like her, Comstock's backing of Kavanaugh contradicted the congresswoman's claim to be a champion of women who experienced sexual harassment.\par \par \uc2 A Comstock campaign ad that aired shortly after the contentious Kavanaugh hearings features Melissa Richmond, who said Comstock believed her claim after she lost a Hill internship because she declined to meet former congressman \uc2 Trent Franks\uc2  (R-Ariz.) at night at his home. Franks, who is not mentioned in the ad, has denied Richmond's account.\par \par \uc2 "When I came forward to share my story, the first person to support me was \uc2 Barbara Comstock\uc2 ," Richmond says in the ad, which aired shortly after Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in an appearance that riveted the nation. "She believed me. And she stood with me."\par \par \uc2 Richmond said in an interview that she met Comstock while they were both working on \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2 's presidential campaign and Comstock reached out to her after reading Richmond's account in The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 A spokesman for Comstock did not respond to requests for an interview.\par \par \uc2 But Comstock has said her support for Kavanaugh never wavered because she has known him for 20 years and knows women who have worked extensively with him.\par \par \uc2 "I do believe that Dr. Ford, you know, had a trauma in her life," she said in an interview last month with \uc2 Fox\uc2  5. "But I think it's important that she was treated by the committee, by Chairman Grassley, with respect, she was able to come forward."\par \par \uc2 Comstock's legislative wins\par \par \uc2 Comstock, 59, grew up in Massachusetts and earned a bachelor's degree at \uc2 Middlebury College\uc2  and a law degree from Georgetown University Law Center. In the 1990s, she quickly ascended from a volunteer for longtime Rep. Frank Wolf, a moderate Republican who represented the 10th District, to senior aide and then to chief investigative counsel for a House committee investigating President \uc2 Bill Clinton\uc2  and his wife, Hillary.\par \par \uc2 From there, she professionalized the opposition research team at the \uc2 Republican National Committee\uc2 , helped President \uc2 George W. Bush\uc2  win in 2000 and ran the Office of Public Affairs at the Justice Department under Attorney General \uc2 John Ashcroft\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 She was first elected to the state legislature in 2009 and served for five years before running for Wolf's seat when he retired.\par \par \uc2 She introduced and Trump signed into law a measure that directs \uc2 NASA\uc2  to continue to support programs designed to encourage women and girls to study science, technology, engineering and math.\par \par \uc2 The president also signed Comstock's bill devoting $50 million to gang task forces, including one in Northern Virginia that works to combat MS-13.\par \par \uc2 The House passed a more controversial bill introduced by Comstock that would expand the authority of the federal government to deport or detain noncitizen immigrants who are gang members or suspected of gang activity.\par \par \uc2 Trump signed a sweeping opioids package, including a measure previously introduced by Comstock that would make it easier to collect data on opioid alternatives.\par \par \uc2 Melody Ferry, 47, a self-employed marking strategist who moved to Sterling four years ago from California, judges Comstock on what she's achieved, not the fact that she shares a party with Trump.\par \par \uc2 "Personally, I consider him a pig of a man," she said. "He offends people and he doesn't really care, which I understand because the older I get the more my give-a-damn gets broken."\par \par \uc2 But, she said, the economy is booming and the borders need protection.\par \par \uc2 "In order for our nation to become [the] economic power that [it] used to be, we need politicians to make hard decisions," she said.\par \par \uc2 Yet for Democrats in the 10th, Trump remains the most effective strategy for galvanizing voters.\par \par \uc2 John Fabris, a 69-year-old retiree from Asburn, considers himself a fiscal conservative and voted for Romney in 2012, but Trump's election made him rethink his 2014 and 2016 votes for Comstock.\par \par \uc2 "How he gets away with the things he gets away with is beyond me," he said before calling voters on behalf of Wexton. "He's an embarrassment."\par \par \uc2 Fabris said he would forfeit the money he made from Trump's tax breaks because he worries there will be a long-term fiscal and environmental fallout. When it comes to his vote for Wexton, it's not personal.\par \par \uc2 "I don't know that I'm anti-Comstock, but she supports him," he said, referring to Trump. "That in and of itself is enough for me to go the other way."\par \par \uc2 jenna.portnoy@washpost.com \par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com\par \par \uc2 WP20181102va10profile\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020181102eeb20001n\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Local-Politics\par {\*\bkmkstart toc33}{\*\bkmkend toc33}\b \uc2 In a Northern Va. swing district, will Trump be enough for Democrats to unseat Rep. Comstock?\b0\par\par\uc2 By Jenna Portnoy \par \uc2 1,851 \uc2 words\par \uc2 2 November 2018\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2018, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 In a Northern Virginia swing district that is one of the most watched in this midterm election, one-quarter of the electorate can't really say what they think of state Sen. Jennifer Wexton. But in most polls, the Democrat is comfortably ahead of \uc2 Rep. Barbara Comstock\uc2 , the two-term Republican who is ubiquitous.\par \par \uc2 That phenomenon says plenty about this particular moment in this particular suburban district across the river from Washington, heavy with college-educated, affluent voters and growing immigrant communities. Voters in Virginia's 10th Congressional District say they want to vote for a Democrat \u8212\'20\'14 any Democrat \u8212\'20\'14 as a check on President Trump.\par \par \uc2 Johannah MacBain, a 38-year-old public school teacher, couldn't remember if she had voted for Comstock in 2016, but she said Trump's election has propelled her to vote for Wexton. Asked why, she said, "If I'm going to be really honest here, [it's] that she's not \uc2 Barbara Comstock\uc2 ."\par \par \uc2 But if anyone can withstand a blue wave, it's Comstock, her supporters say. She has stayed closely connected to community groups throughout her sprawling district and is a tenacious campaigner. \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  swept her district in 2016 by 10\u8201\'20\'09percentage points but Comstock survived, and when the dust cleared, she had outperformed Trump by 16 points.\par \par \uc2 "She is going to win again. Because she's \uc2 Barbara Comstock\uc2 . She has her own brand. She's tough!" said John Fredericks, a conservative radio host and Trump loyalist.\par \par \uc2 Wexton has run a cautious campaign, trying to avoid any fumbles that could jeopardize Democrats' chances to flip a district that has been in Republican hands for nearly 40 years. A lack of a bold message may be why one out of every four voters said they didn't have an opinion of her as recently as early October.\par \par \uc2 "She's competent, she's experienced, she's not going to cause any unforced errors," said former Virginia congressman Jim Moran, a Democrat who recently hosted a fundraiser for her.\par \par \uc2 Wexton's campaign boils down to this: Comstock has voted with Trump 98\u8201\'20\'09percent of the time. Republicans want to destroy your health care. Only Democrats can enact gun control. Her ads call the congresswoman "Barbara Trumpstock."\par \par \uc2 Comstock says she is running as an independent who breaks with Trump when necessary, cares about federal employees and worked to combat sexual harassment. She has embraced the slogan "results, not resistance" and said the vast majority of votes she has cast also had support of at least a few Democrats, including four to address the opioid crisis and 11 to cut government red tape.\par \par \uc2 "These are good policies that are making our country stronger economically, stronger [on] national security and a safer place to live, that people should be embracing [and] not resisting," she said on Fredericks' radio show.\par \par \uc2 The sprawling district contains the affluent, neatly manicured communities of McLean and Ashburn and the liberal enclaves in parts of Loudoun County as well as red, rural stretches of the Shenandoah Valley where voters applaud the president.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18A very good prosecutor\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 Wexton, 50, grew up in Bethesda and earned a bachelor's degree at the University of Maryland and a law degree at William and Mary. From 2001 to 2005, she worked as an assistant commonwealth's attorney in Loudoun County, where she tried cases concerning homicide and domestic abuse.\par \par \uc2 She prosecuted high-profile cases, including the 2002 trial of Clara Jane Schwartz, a college student sentenced to 48 years in prison for orchestrating her father's slaying.\par \par \uc2 "You want to put your A-team on a case like Schwartz," said Tom Mulrine, a lawyer who worked alongside Wexton. "It took a very good prosecutor, a very good prosecutor."\par \par \uc2 The National Republican Congressional Committee seized on Wexton's work in a TV ad that accused her of reducing charges against violent criminals, "even the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who abducted and raped his victim four times."\par \par \uc2 The ad cites two cases where Wexton dropped charges as part of plea bargains, among hundreds of cases she handled.\par \par \uc2 "It's another example of \uc2 Barbara Comstock\uc2  distorting and falsifying my record," Wexton said. "I'm the only person in this race who has put violent criminals in prison."\par \par \uc2 She also served as a court-appointed attorney representing children in abuse and neglect cases, among other duties, as well as serving as a substitute judge in Loudoun in 2010.\par \par \uc2 She stepped down the following year to challenge Loudoun Commonwealth's Attorney Jim Plowman. She lost by about 2,000 votes out of 50,000 votes cast.\par \par \uc2 She had an easier time in back-to-back state Senate races. She won a 2014 special election for the seat \uc2 Mark Herring\uc2  vacated to serve as attorney general and won a full term the next year.\par \par \uc2 In three sessions in Richmond, she has sponsored more than 40 bills that became law, including measures to increase oversight of day-care centers, make it easier for victims of revenge porn to sue, and allow community groups to dispense naloxone, a drug used to treat an opioid overdose.\par \par \uc2 Rebecca Geller of Fairfax Station got to know Wexton in 2015 after a store clerk told Geller to stop breast-feeding her baby. Virginia was one of only three states at the time that didn't protect breast-feeding mothers.\par \par \uc2 Geller left the store and immediately started a push for a law to protect breast-feeding in public. She said Wexton's personal lobbying of her colleagues, especially Republicans, helped calm conservatives worried that it would infringe on the rights of businesses. The bill passed unanimously.\par \par \uc2 "She made it really clear if I'm putting my name on something I'm going to work really hard to get it through," said Geller, who has hosted an open house for Wexton and plans to vote for her.\par \par \uc2 #MeToo in the 10thVA10\par \par \uc2 At a Sterling community festival last month, MacBain, the public school teacher, said she was casting her vote for Wexton as a protest against Comstock and ticked off a list of grievances: Comstock won't hold town halls. She only does photo ops.\par \par \uc2 And then she got to the issue that she felt most strongly about: Comstock's support for the nomination of \uc2 Brett M. Kavanaugh\uc2  to the \uc2 U.S. Supreme Court\uc2 , after he was accused of sexually assaulting Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.\par \par \uc2 "That tells me all I need to know," MacBain said.\par \par \uc2 For MacBain and voters like her, Comstock's backing of Kavanaugh contradicted the congresswoman's claim to be a champion of women who experienced sexual harassment.\par \par \uc2 A Comstock campaign ad that aired shortly after the contentious Kavanaugh hearings features Melissa Richmond, who said Comstock believed her claim after she lost a Hill internship because she declined to meet former congressman \uc2 Trent Franks\uc2  (R-Ariz.) at night at his home. Franks, who is not mentioned in the ad, has denied Richmond's account.\par \par \uc2 "When I came forward to share my story, the first person to support me was \uc2 Barbara Comstock\uc2 ," Richmond says in the ad, which aired shortly after Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in an appearance that riveted the nation. "She believed me. And she stood with me."\par \par \uc2 Richmond said in an interview that she met Comstock while they were both working on \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2 's presidential campaign and Comstock reached out to her after reading Richmond's account in The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 A spokesman for Comstock did not respond to requests for an interview.\par \par \uc2 But Comstock has said her support for Kavanaugh never wavered because she has known him for 20 years and knows women who have worked extensively with him.\par \par \uc2 "I do believe that Dr. Ford, you know, had a trauma in her life," she said in an interview last month with \uc2 Fox\uc2  5. "But I think it's important that she was treated by the committee, by Chairman Grassley, with respect, she was able to come forward."\par \par \uc2 Comstock\u8217\'20\'19s legislative wins\par \par \uc2 Comstock, 59, grew up in Massachusetts and earned a bachelor's degree at \uc2 Middlebury College\uc2  and a law degree from Georgetown University Law Center. In the 1990s, she quickly ascended from a volunteer for longtime Rep. Frank Wolf, a moderate Republican who represented the 10th District, to senior aide and then to chief investigative counsel for a House committee investigating President \uc2 Bill Clinton\uc2  and his wife, Hillary.\par \par \uc2 From there, she professionalized the opposition research team at the \uc2 Republican National Committee\uc2 , helped President \uc2 George W. Bush\uc2  win in 2000 and ran the Office of Public Affairs at the Justice Department under Attorney General \uc2 John Ashcroft\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 She was first elected to the state legislature in 2009 and served for five years before running for Wolf's seat when he retired.\par \par \uc2 She introduced and Trump signed into law a measure that directs \uc2 NASA\uc2  to continue to support programs designed to encourage women and girls to study science, technology, engineering and math.\par \par \uc2 The president also signed Comstock's bill devoting $50 million to gang task forces, including one in Northern Virginia that works to combat MS-13.\par \par \uc2 The House passed a more controversial bill introduced by Comstock that would expand the authority of the federal government to deport or detain non\u173\'00\'ADcitizen immigrants who are gang members or suspected of gang activity.\par \par \uc2 Trump signed a sweeping opioids package, including a measure previously introduced by Comstock that would make it easier to collect data on opioid alternatives.\par \par \uc2 Melody Ferry, 47, a self-employed marking strategist who moved to Sterling four years ago from California, judges Comstock on what she's achieved, not the fact that she shares a party with Trump.\par \par \uc2 "Personally, I consider him a pig of a man," she said. "He offends people and he doesn't really care, which I understand because the older I get the more my give-a-damn gets broken."\par \par \uc2 But, she said, the economy is booming and the borders need protection.\par \par \uc2 "In order for our nation to become [the] economic power that [it] used to be, we need politicians to make hard decisions," she said.\par \par \uc2 Yet for Democrats in the 10th, Trump remains the most effective strategy for galvanizing voters.\par \par \uc2 John Fabris, a 69-year-old retiree from Asburn, considers himself a fiscal conservative and voted for Romney in 2012, but Trump's election made him rethink his 2014 and 2016 votes for Comstock.\par \par \uc2 "How he gets away with the things he gets away with is beyond me," he said before calling voters on behalf of Wexton. "He's an embarrassment."\par \par \uc2 Fabris said he would forfeit the money he made from Trump's tax breaks because he worries there will be a long-term fiscal and environmental fallout. When it comes to his vote for Wexton, it's not personal.\par \par \uc2 "I don't know that I'm anti-Comstock, but she supports him," he said, referring to Trump. "That in and of itself is enough for me to go the other way."\par \par \uc2 jenna.portnoy@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020181101eeb100fid\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Pinned at the top of President Trump's \uc2 Twitter\uc2  feed Wednesday was a video. The man on the screen has a shaved head and a mustache and long chin hair. Smiling, he announces, "I killed f\u8208\'20\'10\u8208\'20\'10\u8208\'20\'10--- cops."\par \par \uc2 The man is Luis Bracamontes, a twice-deported Mexican immigrant who was given the death penalty in April for killing two California law enforcement officers in 2014. At the time of the shootings, Bracamontes was in the United States illegally \u8212\'20\'14 and now, with the midterm election approaching, he's the star of the GOP's latest campaign ad.\par \par \uc2 "\uc2 Illegal immigrant\uc2 , Luis Bracamontes, killed our people!" reads text on the 53-second video, which is filled with audible expletives. "Democrats let him into our country. . . . Democrats let him stay."\par \par \uc2 The text is superimposed over videos of Bracamontes appearing to show no remorse for his crimes, and even declaring, "I'm going to kill more cops soon."\par \par \uc2 More footage follows: Throngs of unidentified people rioting in unidentified streets and pushing down fences in undisclosed locations. A Fox News Channel correspondent interviewing a man identified only as "deported immigrant in caravan," who asks to be pardoned for attempted murder.\par \par \uc2 "Who else would Democrats let in?" the video asks. An image of Bracamontes smiling reappears before being replaced by text, "President \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  and Republicans are making America safe again."\par \par \uc2 The video, which the president promoted Wednesday afternoon to his 55.5 million \uc2 Twitter\uc2  followers, came with a message from Trump to "Vote Republican now!" As of early Thursday morning, the video had been viewed more than 1.8 million times, drawing widespread condemnation.\par \par \uc2 (Note: The following video posted by Trump contains graphic language.)\par \par \uc2 Trump and Republicans were criticized for "fearmongering," and the ad has been decried as "racist," with many likening it to the infamous "Willie Horton" ads supporting George H.W. Bush in the 1988 presidential election. Only the video Trump shared, critics say, is "far worse."\par \par \uc2 About 30 years ago, William Horton, a relatively unknown African American felon in Massachusetts, became "Willie Horton," the focal point of attack ads from Bush's campaign against Michael Dukakis, the Democratic presidential nominee and governor of Massachusetts.\par \par \uc2 Horton, a convicted murderer serving a life sentence, was temporarily released from prison in June 1986 as part of Massachusetts's weekend furlough program, which Dukakis supported. Horton escaped while on furlough and in April 1987, he raped a white woman and stabbed her white fiance.\par \par \uc2 The "Revolving Door" TV ad accusing Dukakis of being soft on crime showed convicts coming in and out of prison through a revolving door made of prison bars, and was meant to allude to Horton, \uc2 Rolling Stone\uc2  reported. The ad was largely masterminded by Roger Ailes, who founded Fox News Channel in 1996.\par \par \uc2 "The only question is whether we depict Willie Horton with a knife in his hand \u8212\'20\'14 or without it," Ailes once told a reporter, according to \uc2 Rolling Stone\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Another ad called "Weekend Passes," run by the National Political Action Committee, took things a step further and included Horton's mug shot. That ad was created by Larry McCarthy, who had worked under Ailes for six years during the 1980s, the New Yorker reported.\par \par \uc2 "This was a classic example of racial cuing," Claire Jean Kim, a political-science professor at the University of California at Irvine, said in a 2012 \uc2 PBS\uc2  special. "The insinuation is, if you elect Governor Dukakis as president, we're going to have black rapists running amok in the country. It's playing to white fears about black crime."\par \par \uc2 Whether it was simply an attempt to criticize Dukakis's crime policies or if it was an appeal to racial fears, the "Willie Horton" ads worked. "Willie Horton was devastating to Mr. Dukakis," the \uc2 New York Times\uc2  wrote in 1990.\par \par \uc2 Kim, who described the ad's strategy as "incredibly effective" and "masterful," said even decades later, it still "sets the bar for racial cuing."\par \par \uc2 "Candidates talk about not wanting to be Willie Hortonized," she said.\par \par \uc2 On Wednesday, critics slammed Trump and Republicans for promoting what was described as a "Willie Horton redux" by both \uc2 CNN\uc2 's Chris Cuomo and the New Republic, a left-leaning magazine.\par \par \uc2 "This may be the most desperate and vile ad since Willie Horton," tweeted former Labor Secretary Robert Reich.\par \par \uc2 One \uc2 Twitter\uc2  user wrote that the Bracamontes video made "the willie horton ad look sensitive."\par \par \uc2 The ad was even criticized by \uc2 Sen. Jeff Flake\uc2  (R-Ariz.).\par \par \uc2 "This is just a new low in campaigning" Flake said, according to a tweet from \uc2 CNN\uc2 's Jake Tapper. "It's sickening."\par \par \uc2 Jamie Weinstein, host of a podcast at the conservative National Review Online, tweeted, "This is, without question, a racist ad."\par \par \uc2 A number of people pushed back against characterizing the ad as "racist."\par \par \uc2 "Not racist but definitely nationalist, and in the accurate sense of the word," one \uc2 Twitter\uc2  user wrote in response to Weinstein, "not the hyped up new definition which conflates it with ethno-nationalism."\par \par \uc2 Another person tweeted, "The ad is 100% truthful."\par \par \uc2 The video was discussed at length by Cuomo and Don Lemon on \uc2 CNN\uc2  on Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 After pointing out that "much of the footage" in the ad "comes from \uc2 Fox\uc2 ," a network often praised by Trump and once helmed by Ailes, the "Willie Horton" ad creator, Cuomo called both ads "grossly distorted, bigoted, but also effective."\par \par \uc2 "At a time when the president says he's calling for unity, all he seems to be pushing for real is fear and division," Cuomo said.\par \par \uc2 Trump, Cuomo said, is attempting to send the message that "Democrats are responsible for the atrocious act" Bracamontes committed.\par \par \uc2 Tom Perez\uc2 , chairman of the Democratic National Committee, hit back at Trump during an appearance on "Cuomo Prime Time" on Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 "This is distracting, divisive Donald at his worst," said Perez, who later noted that immigration is Trump's "dog whistle of all dog whistles." He added: "This is fearmongering."\par \par \uc2 With only five days until the midterm election, Trump has returned to immigration with renewed gusto. His anti-immigration stance was critical to his success during the 2016 presidential campaign and "he is counting on similarly inflammatory words and images to help the GOP hold its congressional majorities," The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2 's Seung Min Kim reported. Just this week, Trump publicly vowed to end birthright citizenship and said he would deploy as many as 15,000 active-duty troops to the border.\par \par \uc2 Conservative commentator Scott Jennings told Cuomo that he wasn't surprised by the ad.\par \par \uc2 "I don't see anything in this video that I haven't heard from the president consistently for the past couple of years," Jennings said. But, he added, "it's not the message I would be closing the campaign on."\par \par \uc2 Lemon echoed his fellow anchor when rebuking the ad.\par \par \uc2 "It's a naked appeal to fear and hate, and it is racist," he said.\par \par \uc2 Douglas Brinkley, a history professor at Rice University, brought up Willie Horton on Lemon's show, noting that although the 1988 ad was effective in the sense that Bush won the election, it did little to help the former president's personal image.\par \par \uc2 "The Willie Horton ad gave George Herbert Walker Bush his one big black eye in history," Brinkley said.\par \par \uc2 More from Morning Mix:\par \par \uc2 Police believe a Ferguson protester's son killed himself. His mother insists he was lynched.\par \par \uc2 Steve King's critics call him a 'white supremacist.' His Democratic opponent? 'Not my place.'\par \par \uc2 Willie McCovey, Charlie Brown, and the hit-that-wasn't in the 1962 World Series. Neither could forget it.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020181101eeb1003h1\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 erik-wemple\par {\*\bkmkstart toc35}{\*\bkmkend toc35}\b \uc2 CNN\uc2  correctly calls Trump's new immigration-fear ad 'racist' ; If you won't call this thing 'racist,' what good is the word?\b0\par\par\uc2 By Erik Wemple \par \uc2 781 \uc2 words\par \uc2 1 November 2018\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2018, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The \uc2 CNN\uc2  headline regarding a new anti-immigration ad posted on President Trump's \uc2 Twitter\uc2  account doesn't sit above an opinion piece. It's a news story, and the byline belongs to Stephen Collinson, who is a\u160\'00\'A0reporter for the network who covers the White House and politics. But it's not every day that such a mainstream news outlet adorns a news story with this sort of headline: "Trump shocks with racist new ad days before midterms."\par \par \uc2 Then again, it's not every day, of course, that a U.S. president promotes such clear-cut racism in pursuit of political gains \u8212\'20\'14 though, to be honest, it has become more routine recently. This particular ad dispenses with whatever restraint Trump may have exercised with his divisive immigration rhetoric. It features footage of Luis Bracamontes, a Mexican citizen who entered the United States illegally more than once and was convicted of killing two law enforcement officers in Northern California. As he received his verdict this year, Bracamontes vowed to "kill more cops soon."\par \par \uc2 In his tweet promoting the video ad, Trump writes, "It is outrageous what the Democrats are doing to our Country. Vote Republican now!" As the ad cycles through Bracamontes's chilling threats in the courtroom, a banner reads, "DEMOCRATS LET HIM INTO OUR COUNTRY." The focus then switches to footage of a migrant caravan overwhelming fences at a checkpoint, and then to a Fox News clip in which a migrant tells a translator that he plans on seeking a pardon for the "felony he committed \u8230\'20\'26 attempted murder." Again, the multitudes splash across the screen, with this banner, "WHO ELSE WOULD DEMOCRATS LET IN?"\par \par \uc2 So the \uc2 CNN\uc2  headline checks out: The video stigmatizes a large group of people of color as criminals \u8212\'20\'14 killers bent on coming in and killing the law-abiding residents of the United States. It's another in the long list of shocking-but-not-surprising developments in the Trump presidency. This is Trump's remarks about Mexico's "rapists" in video format.\par \par \uc2 Most of the ad's coverage draws an inescapable parallel with the infamous "Willie Horton" ad that ran in the 1988 presidential contest between George H.W. Bush and Michael Dukakis. The New Yorker's Jane Mayer summed it up this way:\par \par \uc2 Its key image was a mug shot of Horton\u8212\'20\'14a scowling black man with a dishevelled Afro. Horton, a convicted murderer, had escaped while on a weekend pass issued by a Massachusetts furlough program. A decade earlier, Dukakis had vetoed a bill that would have forbidden furloughs for murderers. After escaping, Horton raped a white woman and stabbed her fianc\u233\'00\'E9. [Ad creator Larry] McCarthy knew that showing Horton's menacing face would make voters feel viscerally that Dukakis was soft on crime.\par \par \uc2 Political guru \uc2 Lee Atwater\uc2 , manager of Bush's campaign, apologized for the politics of Willie Horton:\u160\'00\'A0"In 1988, fighting Dukakis, I said that I 'would strip the bark off the little bastard' and 'make Willie Horton his running mate.' I am sorry for both statements: the first for its naked cruelty, the second because it makes me sound racist, which I am not." The ad's impact is a matter of some dispute; what's not disputed is that the ad was racist.\par \par \uc2 If anything, Trump's Bracamontes ad is worse.\par \par \uc2 Thirty years ago, George H.W. Bush released his infamous fear-mongering, racist ad on Willie Horton.\par \par \uc2 This Trump ad is worse. Far worse. {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://t.co/jLFbhU8FLs"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://t.co/jLFbhU8FLs}}}\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 Eric Umansky (@ericuman) November 1, 2018\par \par \uc2 Other outlets have gone with headlines of varying degrees of honesty:\par \par \uc2 * The Post: "Trump revives 'Willie Horton' tactic with ad linking \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  killer to Democrats"\par \par \uc2 * \uc2 USA Today\uc2 : "Outrage erupts over Trump campaign ad blaming Democrats for immigrant who 'killed our people'\u160\'00\'A0"\par \par \uc2 * HuffPost: "Trump Compares Migrants In Caravan To Cop Killer In Fearmongering Ad"\par \par \uc2 * NBC News: "Trump, in racially divisive ad, blames Democrats for undocumented immigrant convicted of killing police"\par \par \uc2 * BBC: "US mid-terms latest: Trump's immigration ad draws criticism"\par \par \uc2 Here's an ideal time to ditch the hedge of "racially charged," "racially divisive" and the perennial fudge word "controversial."

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 With Joanie Greve\par \par \uc2 THE BIG IDEA:\par \par \uc2 ROME, N.Y. \u8212\'20\'14 More television commercials have aired this fall in New York's 22nd Congressional District than any other House race in the country, but they haven't moved the needle at all. It's an illustration of how much individual candidate quality still matters even in a nationalized political environment.\par \par \uc2 Two years ago, President Trump won this blue-collar district by 16 points after \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2  carried it by less than half a percentage point in 2012. He remains popular, with a job approval rating in the mid-50s.\par \par \uc2 But a Siena College poll conducted at the end of August found Democratic Assemblyman Anthony Brindisi leading Rep. Claudia Tenney (R) by two points, which is within the margin of error. That survey was conducted shortly after a presidential visit to the district.\par \par \uc2 Between mid-September and mid-October, both parties spent almost $3 million to air 12,426 commercials in the district, according to the Wesleyan Media Project.\par \par \uc2 Another Siena poll conducted after that barrage showed Brindisi still ahead by one point, not a statistically significant change. Internal polling by both parties shows the race remains a toss-up.\par \par \uc2 "I've represented this area for the last seven years in the state assembly, and I was born and raised in this community, so when people see some of the lies being told on television, it's hard for them to believe because they know it's not my record," Brindisi said in an interview Wednesday afternoon. "People here are not talking about impeachment \u8230\'20\'26 but the enthusiasm level on our side is through the roof. I don't think I've been asked once at a town hall meeting about \uc2 Nancy Pelosi\uc2 ."\par \par \uc2 -- Senior Democratic strategists say candidates like Brindisi have been an under-covered element of their strategy to win the majority. There are several moderate white men who have deep roots in their local communities that have positioned them well to pick off Republican-held districts, but they've gotten less national attention than minorities, females and military veterans who in many cases are poised to make history and tend to make for better copy. Others in this category include Paul Davis in Kansas, Ben McAdams in Utah and Brendan Kelly in Illinois.\par \par \uc2 -- In the neighboring 24th Congressional District to the west, which includes Syracuse, Trump lost by four points in 2016. Yet Democrat Dana Balter trails Rep. John Katko (R) by 14 points in the latest Siena poll. Brindisi, 39, was one of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee's top recruits this cycle while Balter defeated the DCCC's preferred candidate in the June primary. (That was overshadowed by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's upset of \uc2 Rep. Joe Crowley\uc2  the same night.) The 42-year-old Balter is an unabashed progressive who decided to run last year after being involved with the anti-Trump protest movement. She moved to the area in the mid-2000s for graduate studies and then stayed to teach at \uc2 Syracuse University\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 -- The primary results set the stage for a fascinating tale of two districts. Brindisi is a stronger challenger, and Tenney is a weaker incumbent. Balter is a weaker challenger on paper, and Katko is a stronger incumbent. One of the questions going into next Tuesday is which matters more in 2018: Will midterm races like these be decided more by the candidates or the demographics of the districts? In an environment where races have become so nationalized, to what extent do voters return to their partisan corners as they make final decisions? It is still possible both Brindisi and Balter win \u8212\'20\'14 or lose \u8212\'20\'14 next Tuesday. It seems more probable, though, that a Democrat could win in a district Trump carried by 16 points but lose next door in a district he lost by four.\par \par \uc2 -- One ground truth of 2018 is that it's much easier for incumbents in either party to defy the partisan lean of their district or state if they have a well enough established brand that predates Trump. West Virginians remember \uc2 Sen. Joe Manchin\uc2  (D) as a moderate governor, for example, which is partly why he's favored to get reelected in a state Trump carried by 42 points.\par \par \uc2 Brindisi has never held statewide office, but he's developed a strong local identity in Utica, which is at the heart of the district. He worked at McDonalds during high school and went to Mohawk Valley Community College before transferring to a four-year university. Then he ran for school board soon after his first child was born and two years later got elected to the legislature, where he was soon being recognized as a rising star.\par \par \uc2 -- On the campaign trail, Brindisi emphasizes his independent streak \u8212\'20\'14 including times in Albany that he broke with \uc2 Gov. Andrew Cuomo\uc2  (D) on education and economic development and examples of when he's worked with his GOP counterpart in the state Senate to bring home the bacon for Utica. He's pledged not to support \uc2 Nancy Pelosi\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 He's also sought to localize the race as much as possible. Several of his ads highlight his fight against the unpopular local cable company when it raised rates.\par \par \uc2 Brindisi has eschewed surrogates from outside the district. While NRA President \uc2 Oliver North\uc2 , most famous for his role in the Iran-contra affair, stumped with Tenney on Monday, Brindisi rolled out an endorsement from the firefighter's union. To bracket a high-dollar fundraiser the president hosted for his opponent in August during his visit to Central New York, Brindisi held a small-dollar event at a popular restaurant in Utica where supporters could chip in $10 for his campaign.\par \par \uc2 While GOP commercials say that a vote for him is really a vote for Pelosi, Brindisi's ads highlight endorsements he's received from Republicans. One features the Republican mayor of Frankfort praising him for bringing jobs to the city. The other stars a volunteer firefighter who credits Brindisi with getting him disability benefits.\par \par \uc2 -- Several local elected Republicans who have not endorsed Brindisi nonetheless like the guy and have kept their power dry as a result.\par \par \uc2 As you might guess, in a city called Rome, there is a massive Italian-American community. You might not know that bocce ball remains hugely popular locally. So popular, in fact, that Rome, N.Y., has been hosting the World Series of Bocce for 45 years now.\par \par \uc2 After Brindisi joined the state assembly in 2011, he entered a four-man team for the competition. "It wasn't pretty," he said. "We lost in the first round, and then we were out of it. Bocce is not as easy as it looks. You've got to really practice a lot of be good, and I didn't practice."\par \par \uc2 Every year since then, Brindisi has come by to shake hands and greet participants. The weekend event is a local homecoming of sorts every summer, where you can get $2 draft beers. As they waited to take the stage for the opening ceremony, Brindisi yukked it up with three elected Republicans: the mayor of Rome, the state senator who represents the area and Oneida County Executive Anthony Picente.\par \par \uc2 In addition to sharing the same first name, the conservative county executive has an uncanny resemblance to Brindisi, and people confuse the two all the time. Despite being in different parties, the two men have a good rapport. Picente, who has stayed neutral in the congressional race, told Brindisi that a man on the street had recently walked up to him and asked if he was running for \uc2 U.S. Senate\uc2 . "Congress actually," the county executive replied, not telling the guy that he wasn't actually Brindisi.\par \par \uc2 The candidate thought that was hilarious. "Sometimes the Democrats accuse me of being a Republican," Brindisi joked.\par \par \uc2 "Democrat or Republican, it doesn't really make a difference to us locally," said Jacqueline Izzo, the GOP mayor of Rome. "We're more interested in the people and what we can accomplish. We're a united front when it comes to fighting for the area."\par \par \uc2 -- Brindisi treads carefully around Trump. "I think he still maintains pretty strong popularity in this region, and I've said all along my goal when I get to Washington will be to try to find areas that I can work with the president," he said yesterday, citing infrastructure and prescription drug prices as examples. "But people in this area are not looking for a rubber stamp of any agenda, and they want their representatives to fight for this community as opposed to always being in lockstep with the administration."\par \par \uc2 In contrast, Balter doesn't hesitate to hit Trump. "Trump is not particularly popular here, and people are frustrated with him as always and angry that \uc2 John Katko\uc2  doesn't stand up to him," she said in an interview last night. "\uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  is doing a yeoman's job of trying to distract us from [pocketbook] issues, but we can't take the bait. We have to talk about the things that are happening that are putting residents at risk."\par \par \uc2 -- Balter has turned out to be a much stronger candidate than national Democrats initially feared when she won the primary. She's raised a good amount of money, and her progressive bona fides \u8212\'20\'14 especially in a college town \u8212\'20\'14 have motivated a grass-roots army of more than 1,200 volunteers. She's also gotten establishment support. Yesterday she campaigned with House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, the No. 2 in Democratic leadership. "Everything is going as well as we could possibly want," Balter said.\par \par \uc2 Some in the consultant class have complained that Balter focuses excessively on national issues, such as special counsel \uc2 Bob Mueller\uc2 's probe, which do not move persuadable voters. But she pushes back that people want to make sure there's a check on the president, and that many see a culture of corruption in Washington. "To me, the issue isn't national vs. local," Balter said. "It's understanding that the national issues have local impacts, and that's why people care about them.\par \par \uc2 "In terms of how long I've been here, it means something to people that I am here because I chose to be here," she added. "I chose to make it home because I love it here, I love the history, and I love everything about central New York. I am running for Congress because I want to do everything I can to make this a better place for all of us."\par \par \uc2 Balter argued there's no way that the only recent public poll of the race is accurate. She correctly observed that, if she was actually down double digits, outside Republican groups would not still be pouring in money and launching fresh attack ads against her this week. "It's the same polling outfit that had me 13 points down two weeks before I won by 25 in the primary," she said.\par \par \uc2 -- Candidates matter on both sides: Tenney is gaffe prone while Katko has been disciplined and on message. Tenney attracted widespread criticism in February for saying after the shooting in Parkland, Fla., that Democrats are more prone to be mass shooters. "It's interesting that so many of these people that commit the mass murders end up being Democrats," she told a local radio station. "But the media doesn't talk about that."\par \par \uc2 In a March radio interview, Tenney blamed the "deep state" for Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson acquiring a $31,000 dining set bought for his office.\par \par \uc2 On another call-in show last month, the congresswoman said: "Any dairy farmer that supports my opponent is not a legitimate business owner."\par \par \uc2 Last week, she referred to \uc2 Colgate University\uc2 , her alma mater, as "a left-wing crazy school."\par \par \uc2 Tenney declined an interview request for this story.\par \par \uc2 -- Tenney was elected in 2016 to replace Republican Rep. Richard Hanna. Tenney had challenged Hanna from his right in a 2014 primary, attacking him among other things over his support for same-sex marriage, and he beat her by seven points. Hanna retired in 2016 to avoid another primary challenge. He said his internal polling showed he could have won a three-way race as an independent.\par \par \uc2 Hanna has endorsed Brindisi. "She declared herself all things Trump before Trump. She's unabashed, unqualified and unreserved in her support of him," said Hanna, an outspoken Never Trumper, in an interview yesterday. "In 1519, Cortez's Navy was invading Mexico and he said burn the ships. That's Claudia. She's burning the ships. She's all in for Trump in every imaginable way. \u8230\'20\'26 She's had almost every member of the Trump family up here. The guy doesn't own a dog, so she didn't have that. But everything else."\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, Hanna also endorsed his former GOP colleague Katko. "If I had to pick 10 people that I think could actually get things done and work across the aisle in the House, Katko would be one," he said.\par \par \uc2 WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:\par \par \uc2 -- The latest Post-Schar School poll of battleground districts found Democrats are in a strong position to regain control of the House.Scott Clement and Dan Balz report: "Across 69 congressional districts identified by the Cook Political Report and The Post as competitive in late August, the Post-Schar School poll finds 50 percent of likely voters support the Democratic candidate, while 46 percent support the Republican. The Democrats' four-point edge represents a superficial advantage with Republicans, given the poll's 3.5-point margin of error. Still, the finding marks a sharp turn from 2016, when voters in these districts backed Republicans by a margin of 15 percentage points. With 63 of the battleground districts held by Republicans, that kind of shift in sentiment would be sufficient for Democrats to take control of the House. \u8230\'20\'26 [But] the dynamics of individual districts and uncertainties about turnout make for a wide range in the potential number of seats Democrats will gain Tuesday."\par \par \uc2 GET SMART FAST:\u8203\'20\'0B\u8203\'20\'0B\par \par \uc2 * New research suggests that global warming has advanced far more than previously believed.

'Nobody's coming in. We're not allowing people to come in.' \u8230\'20\'26 If the deployment reaches 15,000 troops, it would be roughly equivalent to the size of the U.S. military's presence in Afghanistan and three times the size of the presence in Iraq. Already, the deployment is believed to be the largest of its kind in more than a century."\par \par \uc2 -- Trump said at a\u160\'00\'A0Florida rally last night that Republican congressional majorities would allow him to enact his immigration agenda, including ending birthright citizenship.Philip Rucker reports: "The president spoke at length about birthright citizenship, which he called 'this crazy policy' that he said allowed 'hundreds of thousands of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  children' born on U.S. soil to automatically become U.S. citizens and therefore eligible for every privilege and benefit of citizenship. \u8230\'20\'26 'We're getting prepared for the caravan, folks,' Trump said. \u8230\'20\'26 He called the migrants 'the opposition,' but added, 'We're tougher than anybody.' Trump then suggested that border agents might imprison migrants seeking asylum. 'They're not going to be released,' the president said. 'It's called catch, but we take the word 'release' out. We're not going to be releasing them.' The crowd cheered."\par \par \uc2 -- Trump's singular focus on immigration has scrambled many campaigns' strategies in the final days before Nov. 6.Seung Min Kim reports: "Trump's legally questionable call to revoke birthright citizenship through a unilateral executive order has drawn ... rejections from House Republicans in competitive reelection contests, such as Reps. Mike Coffman (R-Colo.) and \uc2 Carlos Curbelo\uc2  (R-Fla.). \u8230\'20\'26 On the Democratic side, \uc2 Sen. Joe Donnelly\uc2  (D-Ind.), a moderate running for reelection in a conservative state, appeared to leave the door open to legislation that would end birthright citizenship \u8230\'20\'26 In an interview with Fox News on Monday, Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) urged Trump to 'use every tool he has at his disposal' to halt the caravan of migrants traveling north to the United States, adding, 'I 100 percent back him up on that.'"\par \par \uc2 -- The blame game: On\u160\'00\'A0\uc2 Twitter\uc2 , Trump continued to lay the groundwork for\u160\'00\'A0blaming congressional leaders if the GOP loses the House. He\u160\'00\'A0lashed\u160\'00\'A0out\u160\'00\'A0against Speaker \uc2 Paul Ryan\uc2  (R-Wis.), who stated what most legal scholars believe: The president cannot end birthright citizenship with an executive order.\u160\'00\'A0"\uc2 Paul Ryan\uc2  should be focusing on holding the Majority rather than giving his opinions on Birthright Citizenship, something he knows nothing about!" Trump tweeted. "Our new Republican Majority will work on this, Closing the Immigration Loopholes and Securing our Border!"\u160\'00\'A0(Felicia Sonmez and John Wagner)\par \par \uc2 -- An ad that Trump promoted on his \uc2 Twitter\uc2  page links Democrats to Luis Bracamontes, a Mexican immigrant who was given the death penalty for killing two Sacramento County sheriff's deputies in 2014.Allyson Chiu reports: "At the time of the shooting, Bracamontes was in the U.S. illegally \u8230\'20\'26 '\uc2 Illegal immigrant\uc2 , Luis Bracamontes, killed our people!' reads text on the 53-second video, which is littered with audible expletives. 'Democrats let him into our country .\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09. Democrats let him stay.' \u8230\'20\'26 Trump and Republicans were criticized for 'fearmongering,' and the ad has been decried as 'racist,' with many likening it to the infamous 'Willie Horton' ads supporting George H.W. Bush in the 1988 presidential election. Only the video shared by Trump, critics say, is 'far worse.'"\par \par \uc2 -- Trump's critics accuse him of using the official term "national emergency" to stoke fear among his supporters.David Nakamura reports: "Aiming his ire at [the caravan], Trump vowed he was 'bringing out the military for a National Emergency.' \u8230\'20\'26 But Trump has filed no legal proclamation declaring a national crisis as required under a 1976 law enacted to rein in abuses of executive power by granting presidents additional authorities only in specific instances and for a limited time frame. For Trump, the caravan is an emergency merely because he said so."\par \par \uc2 -- Trump and House GOP leaders said they will not try to pursue a middle-class tax cut until next year, contradicting what the president has said repeatedly.Damian Paletta reports: "'We are committed to delivering an additional 10 percent tax cut to middle-class workers across the country,' Trump and \uc2 Rep. Kevin Brady\uc2  (R-Tex.), chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said in [a] joint statement. 'And we intend to take swift action on this legislation at the start' of the new Congress next year. Trump said last week that he would pursue a 10 percent tax cut and deliver some sort of resolution this week, though he gave no further details about how that would happen."\par \par \uc2 -- The narrative: On the campaign trail, Trump has offered voters "a litany of misleading statements and falsehoods that exaggerate even legitimate accomplishments and distort opponents' views beyond the typical bounds of political spin,"the \uc2 New York Times\uc2 's Peter Baker and Linda Qiu report. "In the past couple of weeks alone, the president has spoken of riots that have not happened, claimed deals that have not been reached, cited jobs that have not been created and spun dark conspiracies that have no apparent basis in reality. He has pulled figures seemingly out of thin air, rewritten history and contradicted his own past comments. \u8230\'20\'26 [E]ven some in Mr. Trump's orbit acknowledge that this campaign season has brought out a torrent of untruths that, they worry, distracts from a record he should be proud to outline factually."\par \par \uc2 MORE ON THE MIDTERMS:\par \par \uc2 -- Record turnout: Early and absentee voting numbers in at least 17 states have already surpassed the total number of such ballots cast in 2014.Amy Gardner reports: "In some cases, early and absentee vote totals are on track to double since four years ago. The numbers are so high in some states that early voting may exceed total vote counts \u8212\'20\'14 including Election Day tallies \u8212\'20\'14 from four years ago. The heightened participation reflects in part a surge of interest among Democrats \u8230\'20\'26 But data from several battleground states with marquee Senate or governor's races show Republicans are also very engaged \u8212\'20\'14 as much as they were four years ago \u8212\'20\'14 suggesting many hard-fought races could be even closer than surveys are predicting."\par \par \uc2 -- A new round of Fox News polls shows the Senate races in Indiana, Arizona and Missouri remain\u160\'00\'A0toss-ups,\u160\'00\'A0while Republicans have pulled ahead in North Dakota and Tennessee.Fox News's Dana Blanton reports: "Democrat Kyrsten Sinema and Republican \uc2 Martha McSally\uc2  tie at 46 percent apiece among Arizona likely voters. \u8230\'20\'26 Incumbent Democrat \uc2 Sen. Joe Donnelly\uc2  bests Republican challenger \uc2 Mike Braun\uc2  by seven points among Indiana likely voters, 45-38 percent.\u160\'00\'A0 His lead is at the poll's margin of error. \u8230\'20\'26 Democratic incumbent Sen. Claire McCaskill and her Republican challenger \uc2 Josh Hawley\uc2  tie at 43 percent apiece. \u8230\'20\'26 Republican \uc2 Marsha Blackburn\uc2  is pulling away from Democrat Phil Bredesen in the race to fill retiring Republican Sen.

Scott Walker and Democrat Tony Evers tied at 47 percent each among likely voters, the stage is now set for a frenetic closing sprint ... 'Well, it couldn't be any closer,' Marquette poll director Charles Franklin said. 'We had exactly the same number of respondents picking each side.' \u8230\'20\'26 In the race for \uc2 U.S. Senate\uc2 , Democratic incumbent Tammy Baldwin led Republican challenger Leah Vukmir by 54 percent to 43 percent."\par \par \uc2 -- \uc2 Sen. Joe Donnelly\uc2  (D-Ind.) was criticized for how he phrased his praise for his staff members who are people of color. "Our state director is Indian American, but he does an amazing job. Our director of all constituent services, she's African American. But she does an even more incredible job than you could ever imagine. It isn't the race or religion, it's the incredible person that they are," Donnelly said during a debate. \uc2 Politico\uc2 's Burgess Everett reports: "The \uc2 National Republican Senatorial Committee\uc2  said Donnelly's comments are 'exactly the type of gaffe he couldn't afford to make a week out from Election Day.' A low-key lawmaker not prone to making spontaneous comments, Donnelly said his phrasing was a mistake and attacked Braun for supporting a lawsuit to scuttle Obamacare. 'I misspoke.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), which could point to trouble for her eventual 2020 bid.The \uc2 Boston Globe\uc2 's Liz Goodwin reports: "The comments from the two red-state lawmakers ahead of Election Day also illustrate how the Massachusetts senator has become something of a political pinata for moderate Democrats trying to show their independence from the liberal resistance wing of the party. \u8230\'20\'26 McCaskill pointed the finger at her colleague Monday when asked to identify the 'crazy Democrats' she had referred to in a radio ad as politicians she had little in common with. \u8230\'20\'26 [Tester] took a swipe at Warren's recent DNA test that showed evidence she had a distant Native American ancestor."\par \par \uc2 -- The activities of Republican Senate candidate \uc2 Josh Hawley\uc2 's out-of-state political consultants shortly after he became Missouri attorney general may raise legal concerns.Lindsay Wise, Jason Hancock and Steve Vockrodt report for the Kansas City Star: "[W]ithin weeks of Hawley's swearing in as the state's top law enforcement official, the high-powered political team that would go on to run his \uc2 U.S. Senate\uc2  campaign had stepped in to help direct the office of the Missouri attorney general \u8212\'20\'14 and raise his national profile. Hawley's out-of-state political consultants gave direct guidance and tasks to his taxpayer-funded staff, and followed up to ensure the tasks were completed, according to emails, text messages and other records \u8230\'20\'26 The campaign-led strategy sessions, which began in January 2017, raised legal and ethical concerns at the time among some of Hawley's employees, who worried about mixing politics with public business."\par \par \uc2 -- New Jersey Democrats are scrambling to save \uc2 Bob Menendez\uc2 's Senate seat in the reliably blue state.The \uc2 New York Times\uc2 's Nick Corasaniti and Jonathan Martin report: "In New Jersey, many of the suburbanites who are backing Democratic House candidates from Republican-leaning areas are still uneasy about embracing Mr. Menendez after his 2017 federal corruption trial, which ended in a mistrial. And these voters have been reminded of that case most every day by a monthslong, $30 million ad campaign financed by \uc2 Bob Hugin\uc2 , a wealthy former pharmaceutical executive who is Mr. Menendez's Republican opponent. \u8230\'20\'26 New Jersey's leading Democrats \u8230\'20\'26 are pleading for voters to rally behind Mr. Menendez. \u8230\'20\'26 And most remarkably, Senate Majority PAC, a principal Democratic super PAC, has spent about $7 million on commercials in the expensive New York and Philadelphia television markets[.]"\par \par \uc2 -- Campaign staffers for Democratic congressional candidate \uc2 Abigail Spanberger\uc2  confronted a volunteer working undercover for the conservative group Project Veritas.Laura Vozzella reports: "The campaign said a young woman working for Project Veritas posed as a Democratic volunteer and spent every day over the past several weeks in Spanberger's suburban Richmond campaign office, performing basic office tasks \u8212\'20\'14 and peppering her office mates with questions that eventually raised red flags. Campaign staffers on Wednesday confronted her and asked her to leave, a video released by the campaign shows. \u8230\'20\'26 James O'Keefe, founder of New York-based Project Veritas, suggested that the undercover work had borne fruit but also lamented that it was cut short by the ouster of the mole, whom the Spanberger campaign identified as Marisa Jorge."\par \par \uc2 -- A Democratic congressional candidate in Ohio dismissed some of his staffers after one was accused of infiltrating his opponent's campaign.Mike DeBonis reports: "Aftab Pureval, who is running against GOP Rep.

His sudden rise is reminiscent of [Trump] \u8230\'20\'26 Now his coffers were full. In the most recent quarter, he raised $1.4 million in campaign donations. The [DCCC] was sending consultants to southern West Virginia to help with more professional looking campaign ads and media buys. The money and attention were helping Ojeda to blast out his pro-union, anti-establishment message. But [Madalin] Sammons, a key aide, worried the scripted ads and outside consultants were making Ojeda sound too much like a conventional politician."\par \par \uc2 -- Liberal groups are pushing House Democrats to make a government-overhaul bill their first priority if they regain the majority.Mike DeBonis reports: "The effort has gotten at least tentative backing from top House Democratic leaders. \u8230\'20\'26 But the demand from outside groups \u8212\'20\'14 including influential organizations such as the \uc2 Service Employees International Union\uc2 , \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2 , and the \uc2 Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights\uc2  \u8212\'20\'14 who have signed a 'Declaration for American Democracy' stands to make an overhaul bill a top priority, even as Democratic candidates campaign mainly on preserving affordable health care and Social Security.

While a gain of two to five members is not much at face value, the House Republican Conference will most likely be a lot smaller in the next Congress. \u8230\'20\'26 So the more seats Republicans lose in the midterms, the larger the Freedom Caucus will be as a percentage of the conference."\par \par \uc2 -- Some of \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 's supporters wonder if the idealism he continues to espouse is the wrong fit for Democratic candidates in the Trump era.The \uc2 New York Times\uc2 's Astead W.

Hsu reports: "The release of the referral \u8212\'20\'14 delivered in 1974 as impeachment proceedings were being weighed \u8212\'20\'14 came after a former member of Nixon's defense team and three prominent legal analysts filed separate lawsuits seeking its unsealing after more than four decades under grand jury secrecy rules.

The special counsel has evidence that suggests Corsi may have had advance knowledge that the email account of Clinton's campaign manager, \uc2 John Podesta\uc2 , had been hacked and that \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  had obtained a trove of damning emails from it, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter [said]."\par \par \uc2 PITTSBURGH FALLOUT:\par \par \uc2 -- Synagogue shooting suspect Robert Bowers was charged in a 44-count indictment accusing him of federal hate crimes.Matt Zapotosky, Devlin Barrett and Mark Berman report: "The indictment charges Bowers, a truck driver, with killing 11 people, and for each of those victims he faces separate counts of obstruction of free exercise of religion resulting in death and of using a firearm to commit murder during a crime of violence. He also faces charges of attempting to kill people exercising their religious beliefs and civil rights charges related to injuring several police officers who responded to the attack. The charges carry a possible death sentence, and the Justice Department has said previously that federal prosecutors in Pittsburgh had initiated the process to seek such a punishment."\par \par \uc2 -- Trump was criticized for focusing on himself in tweets about his visit to Pittsburgh.Felicia Sonmez reports: "'Melania and I were treated very nicely yesterday in Pittsburgh,' Trump tweeted Wednesday morning. 'The Office of the President was shown great respect on a very sad & solemn day. We were treated so warmly. Small protest was not seen by us, staged far away. The Fake News stories were just the opposite-Disgraceful!' The 'small' protest he referenced was actually made up of about 2,000 people. Trump followed up with another tweet later Wednesday in which he urged voters to back \uc2 Rep. Keith Rothfus\uc2  (R-Pa.) in next week's midterm elections because of the 'inspiring' compassion he showed for victims of the shooting."\par \par \uc2 -- Trump likely did not see the protest of thousands while he was in Pittsburgh.Avi Selk and Kyle Swenson report: "Police wouldn't allow the march to come near the synagogue, and Trump's motorcade took a different route when it departed for a hospital, where the president visited police officers wounded in the shooting. Of the small, impromptu crowds Trump would have seen along the way, a few even cheered him."\par \par \uc2 FLORIDA FALLOUT:\par \par \uc2 -- Federal prosecutors accused mail-bomb suspect Cesar Sayoc of committing "a domestic terrorist attack" and running Web searches for his alleged targets' home addresses.Matt Zapotosky reports: "Prosecutors also revealed that investigators seized a laptop from Sayoc's van that contained a list of addresses matching those on the packages prosecutors say he mailed \u8230\'20\'26 Federal prosecutors wrote that the Internet search history on Sayoc's phone shows he searched 'hilary Clinton hime address' on July 15 and 'address Debbie wauserman Shultz' on July 26. Each of the packages listed Shultz \u8212\'20\'14 a likely misspelling of \uc2 Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz\uc2  (D-Fla.) \u8212\'20\'14 in the return address.

The perpetrators of this share of hate crimes are largely white men who hold the belief, exacerbated by rhetoric in politics and media, that they are protecting their culture, race and an endangered way of life that has historically \u8212\'20\'14 and, in their view, rightly \u8212\'20\'14 placed them at the top.

Managed by [DHS], the program was given $10 million to distribute. \u8230\'20\'26 But weeks after [Trump] took office, the funding was put on hold.

Employing barely coded anti-Semitism, they have built a warped portrayal of him as the mastermind of a 'globalist' movement, a left-wing radical who would undermine the established order and a proponent of diluting the white, Christian nature of their societies through immigration.

\par\par \uc2 National-Enterprise\par {\*\bkmkstart toc37}{\*\bkmkend toc37}\b \uc2 Steve King\uc2 's critics call him a 'white supremacist.' His Democratic opponent? 'Not my place.' \b0\par\par\uc2 By Isaac Stanley-Becker \par \uc2 1,623 \uc2 words\par \uc2 1 November 2018\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2018, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 When \uc2 Rep. Steve King\uc2  (R-Iowa) took to \uc2 Twitter\uc2  to declare his support for ethnic nationalism, writing last year, "We can't restore our civilization with somebody else's babies," J.D. Scholten's friends from out of state bombarded him with questions.\par \par \uc2 "Is this where you're from?" they asked. "Is this you?"\par \par \uc2 The former minor league pitcher didn't know how to respond. "I would love to say, 'That doesn't represent us,' but 'representative' is his job title," he said.\par \par \uc2 Scholten, 38, is the Democrat trying to wrest that title from King, who has been engulfed in controversy this week over his racially incendiary rhetoric, as the nation remains on high alert following the massacre on Saturday of 11 Jews in Pittsburgh. Meanwhile, the nonpartisan Cook Political Report has moved the race for Iowa's 4th Congressional District, which lies in the northwest quadrant of the state, from "likely" to "lean" Republican.\par \par \uc2 King has compared immigrants to dogs and said young migrants had "calves the size of cantaloupes" because they were transporting heavy loads of marijuana. He tweeted a cartoon depicting former president \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  wearing a turban. His party didn't rebuke him in June when he retweeted a message from a self-described "Nazi sympathizer." Last month, he voiced support for Faith Goldy, an unsuccessful Toronto mayoral candidate who has promoted the notion that a "white genocide" is underway. And last week, reports surfaced that King had met in August with members of an Austrian political party founded by former Nazis, during a trip funded by a group that promotes awareness of the Holocaust.\par \par \uc2 "I don't know really how to define it other than selfish," Scholten said in an interview with The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2 , when asked how he would describe the conduct of his opponent.\par \par \uc2 The Democratic candidate pointedly refrained from calling King a "racist" or a "white nationalist" \u8212\'20\'14 terms that others, and not just Democrats, have used, opening the door for Scholten to pounce. Instead, he framed his opponent's association with far-right figures abroad and his inflammatory statements at home as an abdication of leadership, noting that King wasn't named to the cross-chamber committee hashing out the terms of the farm bill, which is critical to a district where agriculture is king.\par \par \uc2 "I don't get into name-calling," he said. "I'm absolutely disgusted with a lot of what he stands for, but I didn't run for Congress to call him anything. It's not my place to do it. I'll let the voters decide on what's appropriate and not appropriate. I'm not the one who defines what a racist is."\par \par \uc2 His restraint points to a different tack in a campaign season convulsed by debates over identity \u8212\'20\'14 debates that have driven the two parties further apart. Examples abound. Georgia could elect the country's first female African American governor, who is a Democrat, or the Republican, who has pledged to "round up 'illegals.' " The Republican candidate for Senate in Arizona said her opponent, who is bisexual, supported "treason" because of comments she had made about war in the Middle East. In Vermont, Democrats made \uc2 Christine Hallquist\uc2  the country's first openly transgender major-party nominee for governor, as the Trump administration considers narrowly defining gender as linked to biological sex.\par \par \uc2 The divisions are stark, and some Democrats have tried to use them to their advantage. "I'm not calling Mr. DeSantis a racist. I'm simply saying the racists believe he's a racist," concluded \uc2 Andrew Gillum\uc2 , the Democratic nominee for governor in Florida, during a heated debate last month, referring to a record of statements dogging his Republican opponent, \uc2 Rep. Ron DeSantis\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Scholten \u8212\'20\'14 who, unlike Gillum, is white \u8212\'20\'14 said he doesn't feel the need to level such a blunt accusation.\par \par \uc2 "It's not that I'm uncomfortable. I believe the district needs new, moral leadership from someone who unequivocally rejects white nationalism and racism," he said. "I feel things are clear. It doesn't matter what I say one way or the other. He is who he is. It speaks for itself."\par \par \uc2 Rep. Steve Stivers\uc2  (R-Ohio), the chairman of the House Republican campaign arm, on Tuesday assailed King for "white supremacy and hate," and the fundraising group he heads said it wouldn't "play" in King's race. \uc2 Land O'Lakes\uc2 , the dairy giant, pulled its financial support the same day, citing the "company's values."\par \par \uc2 And on Wednesday, another fellow Republican, \uc2 Rep. Carlos Curbelo\uc2  of Florida, said on MSNBC that he would never vote for "someone like \uc2 Steve King\uc2 ," even if it meant forfeiting control of the House, calling his colleague's statements and actions "disgusting." The same day, the head of the \uc2 Anti-Defamation League\uc2 , \uc2 Jonathan Greenblatt\uc2 , called on House Speaker \uc2 Paul D. Ryan\uc2  (R-Wis.) to censure King for statements and affiliations "that are anti-Semitic and offensive not just to the Jewish community, but to all Americans." Ryan did not do so.\par \par \uc2 The harsh reproach enforced a degree of accountability for King. But his hard-line views on race and cultural identity have moved further into the mainstream during the presidency of \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 , who has aimed to make the final days of the midterm campaign about polarizing issues of immigration and national belonging. King, an eight-term congressman, parroted the president's rhetoric in responding to the criticism, blaming the "fake news" and "Establishment Never Trumpers."\par \par \uc2 A poll released Tuesday by Change Research, a Democratic firm, found that King had only a one-point lead over Scholten, a first-time candidate. David Wasserman, Cook's House editor, called Scholten King's "first credible challenger in six years." He has massively outraised the incumbent, his campaign coffers lined by contributions from national donors \u8212\'20\'14 from Florida to Texas to Massachusetts \u8212\'20\'14 some of whom view King as a "white supremacist" and a "bigot."\par \par \uc2 Scholten has forcefully denounced King's comments and has called on Republicans to join him. But the lifelong Democrat, who has worked as a paralegal in Minneapolis and Seattle, is speaking to a specific audience. Since 2012, King has been reelected seven times in a district where voters favored Trump to \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  roughly 2 to 1.\par \par \uc2 The candidate has left the sharper barbs to the American Values PAC, a group targeting King and \uc2 Rep. Devin Nunes\uc2  (R-Calif.), the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. One ad called King "Klan and neo-Nazi approved."\par \par \uc2 That enables Scholten to present himself as a "healthy alternative," as he described his campaign in a phone interview from the road north of Sioux City, the city of about 80,000 where he grew up.\par \par \uc2 He graduated from the University of Nebraska and pursued professional baseball, playing abroad as well as for his hometown team, the Sioux City Explorers. He stands at 6 foot 6 but never made it to the major leagues.\par \par \uc2 Between seasons, Scholten began a career as a paralegal. But he moved home nearly two years ago, at the encouragement of his grandmother, who asked him to take over the family farm shortly before she died. When the farm passed to his mother's generation, Scholten returned and purchased his family home from his parents. The best job he could find paid $15 an hour and came without benefits, so he created a position of his own, as a freelance paralegal.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, a candidate willing to take on King had yet to emerge. "That's when I was like, 'You know what, I cannot let \uc2 Steve King\uc2  just go without an opponent,'" he said. He announced his candidacy last summer.\par \par \uc2 Scholten said he has visited each of the district's 39 counties at least three times. Residents, he said, weren't worried about birthright citizenship or the migrant caravan heading toward the southern border. "Kitchen-table topics," such as health care, were at the center of conversations. People in the district want border security, he said, but the area also has a labor shortage. A grain elevator recently needed 39 employees to help with the harvest, "and they didn't get one American citizen to apply," he said.\par \par \uc2 In a deep-red district, he is running as an outsider and a populist. He has the endorsement of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), as well as that of the Sioux City Journal, which has favored King in the past.\par \par \uc2 "The average person in Congress is 58 years old, with a net worth of $1 million," Scholten said in an ad from earlier this year. "Well, I'm different. I'm 20 years younger and just shy of $1 million short of that average."\par \par \uc2 He dared viewers, "Tell me this race is unwinnable."\par \par \uc2 National Democrats long saw it that way, he said. Before this week's poll, King was recently shown to have anywhere from a six to a 20-point lead. "For the longest time, I've been trying to scream to say, 'Hey, we're on pace to beat this guy,' and nobody was making much noise about it," Scholten said.\par \par \uc2 He sees some signs of change. His campaign manager texted him Wednesday to say that the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which has faced criticism for discounting progressive candidates, had "responded with more than just a sentence this time," Scholten said.\par \par \uc2 More from Morning Mix:\par \par \uc2 Trump revives 'Willie Horton' with ad linking \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  killer to Democrats\par \par \uc2 Police believe a Ferguson protester's son killed himself. His mother insists he was lynched.\par \par \uc2 Willie McCovey, Charlie Brown, and the hit-that-wasn't in the 1962 World Series.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 ESTERO, Fla. \u8212\'20\'14 President Trump introduced the polarizing issue of birthright citizenship as a central plank of his closing argument to voters here Wednesday night as he began his final campaign sprint to Election Day.\par \par \uc2 Trump said illegal immigration was the driving issue of the midterm elections and vowed that with enlarged Republican congressional majorities he would achieve his immigration priorities, including eliminating the constitutional right to citizenship for those born in the United States to undocumented immigrant parents.\par \par \uc2 The president spoke at length about birthright citizenship, which he called "this crazy policy" that he said allowed "hundreds of thousands of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  children" born on U.S. soil to automatically become U.S. citizens and therefore eligible for every privilege and benefit of citizenship.\par \par \uc2 "Birthright citizenship \u8212\'20\'14 you know all about it \u8212\'20\'14 we will keep the criminals, the drug dealers, we will keep them all out of our country," Trump said. "We will get rid of all of this. We will end, finally, birthright citizenship. It's costing us so many billions of dollars."\par \par \uc2 Trump said this week that he was considering signing an executive order ending birthright citizenship, though he acknowledged earlier Wednesday that it was likely to result in a legal challenge that could go all the way to the Supreme Court.\par \par \uc2 Most legal scholars \u8212\'20\'14 as well as House Speaker \uc2 Paul D. Ryan\uc2  (R-Wis.) \u8212\'20\'14 have said the president does not have the power to eliminate the policy with the stroke of his pen because it is a constitutional right spelled out in the 14th Amendment.\par \par \uc2 But Trump argued otherwise during his rollicking campaign rally at a Florida sports arena.\par \par \uc2 "The Constitution does not require it," the president said, because "illegal aliens are not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States."\par \par \uc2 The standing crowd of several thousand roared with approval.\par \par \uc2 Trump has focused on the issue of immigration in the home stretch of the campaign as part of a strategy to stoke fear and galvanize his core supporters to turn out in support of Republican candidates for the Senate, House and governorships.\par \par \uc2 As he has for days now, here at his Wednesday rally, Trump warned of the caravan of Central American migrants making its way north toward the U.S.-Mexico border. Though the migrants are hundreds of miles from the border, Trump this week deployed 5,200 U.S. troops there and said he was planning to send more.\par \par \uc2 Trump seemed to preview action at the border. "It's going to be very interesting over the next week," he told the rally crowd, though the commander in chief did not offer any details of what he might have in store.\par \par \uc2 "We're getting prepared for the caravan, folks," Trump said. "We've got a lot of rough people in those caravans. They are not angels. They are not." He called the migrants "the opposition," but added, "We're tougher than anybody."\par \par \uc2 Trump then suggested that border agents might imprison migrants seeking asylum. "They're not going to be released," the president said. "It's called catch, but we take the word 'release' out. We're not going to be releasing them." The crowd cheered.\par \par \uc2 The president kicked off his sprint to Election Day with plans to hold at least 11 "Make America Great Again" rallies in Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Missouri, Montana, Ohio, Tennessee and West Virginia.\par \par \uc2 Trump won each of these states in 2016 and is trying to leverage his popularity in them to lift Republican candidates for the \uc2 U.S. Senate\uc2  and governorships to victory. He cast the election as a referendum on his presidency, saying, "Everything we have achieved" is at stake. He called this "one of the most important elections of our entire lives \u8212\'20\'14 though I will say, not as important as 2016."\par \par \uc2 Trump spotlighted Florida Republican candidates, including two who joined him on stage: \uc2 Gov. Rick Scott\uc2 , who is running for the Senate, and \uc2 Rep. Ron DeSantis\uc2 , who is running for governor. He also singled out two congressmen up for reelection, Reps. \uc2 Francis Rooney\uc2  and \uc2 Matt Gaetz\uc2 , though he notably said nothing about their records on behalf of Floridians. Rather, he praised their defense of him on cable television.\par \par \uc2 "So great to me on television," Trump said of Rooney. "I love it when he defends me. He's brutal. He gets the job done."\par \par \uc2 Both Scott and DeSantis used their turn on Trump's stage \u8212\'20\'14 behind the presidential lectern, with thousands of his devoted supporters watching from around the arena \u8212\'20\'14 to bash their respective Democratic opponents, \uc2 Sen. Bill Nelson\uc2  and Tallahassee Mayor \uc2 Andrew Gillum\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 DeSantis called Gillum a "failed mayor" and said Gillum was "running on impeaching the president." Then he brought up the federal public-corruption investigation of Tallahassee \u8212\'20\'14 Gillum has said he did nothing wrong \u8212\'20\'14 and said, "Maybe we should impeach Gillum as mayor of Tallahassee!"\par \par \uc2 That inspired the crowd to chant, "Lock him up!"\par \par \uc2 Trump opened his rally by condemning the massacre of 11 Jewish worshipers last Saturday at a synagogue in Pittsburgh, which the president visited Tuesday. The president denounced "the vile poison of anti-Semitism" but almost immediately turned to attack the news media for its coverage of the community's peaceful protests of his visit. He accused the media of using the tragedy to sow anger.\par \par \uc2 "We have forcefully condemned hatred, racism, bigotry and prejudice in all of its forms, but the media doesn't want you to hear your story," Trump said. "It's not my story; it's your story. And that's why 33\u160\'00\'A0percent of the people in this country believe the fake news is in fact \u8212\'20\'14 and I hate to say this \u8212\'20\'14 in fact the enemy of the people."\par \par \uc2 The crowd chanted in response, "\uc2 CNN\uc2  Sucks!" One woman in the stands could be heard loudly screaming the name of Jim Acosta, the network's chief White House correspondent, who was covering the rally.\par \par \uc2 Even as his fans shouted down journalists, chanted for a Democratic mayor to be jailed and cheered for the end of birthright citizenship, Trump tried to portray his movement \u8212\'20\'14 "the greatest movement in the history of our country," as he put it \u8212\'20\'14 as one of harmony and inclusiveness.\par \par \uc2 "Our movement is about love for fellow Americans," Trump said. "Our movement is where everyone belongs."\par \par \uc2 philip.rucker@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020181101eeb1000m9\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

He regrets it again. \b0\par\par\uc2 By Michael Brice-Saddler \par \uc2 675 \uc2 words\par \uc2 1 November 2018\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2018, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Harry M. Reid appeared impassioned \u8212\'20\'14 even upset, at times \u8212\'20\'14 when he took the Senate floor in 1993 and declared "no sane country" would grant birthright citizenship to children born on its soil to parents who lack legal status.\par \par \uc2 The then-Nevada senator had recently introduced the Immigration Stabilization Act of 1993, which challenged the clause in the 14th Amendment that grants automatic citizenship to any child born within U.S. borders.\par \par \uc2 "If making it easy to be an illegal alien isn't enough, how about offering a reward to be an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . No sane country would do that, right?" Reid, a Democrat, asked his peers on Sept. 20, 1993. "Guess again. If you break our laws by entering this country without permission and give birth to a child, we reward that child with U.S. citizenship and guarantee a full access to all public and social services this society provides \u8212\'20\'14 and that's a lot of services."\par \par \uc2 [ Trump vows executive order to end birthright citizenship, a move most legal experts say would run afoul of the Constitution ]\par \par \uc2 Now, more than 25 years later, President Trump is using Reid's speech to support his own push to end birthright citizenship in the United States, echoing a similar strategy used during the nomination process for Supreme Court Justice \uc2 Brett M. Kavanaugh\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 On Wednesday, Trump tweeted out a segment of Reid's Senate-floor speech and wrote, "Harry M. Reid, when he was sane, agreed with us on Birthright Citizenship!"\par \par \uc2 The tweet was one of several in which Trump criticized birthright citizenship, claiming without evidence that it "costs our country billions of dollars and is very unfair to our citizens," and "will be ended one way or the other." The president in recent days has questioned the constitutionality of birthright citizenship, vowing to sign an executive order that would end the right to citizenship for children born in the country to noncitizens. The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2 's Fact Checker gave Trump's claims, first made in an interview with Axios, three Pinocchios, and most legal experts agree that the 14th Amendment grants citizenship to those born on U.S. soil, The Post's John Wagner and Felicia Sonmez reported.\par \par \uc2 Top Democrats have dismissed Trump's assertion, with House Minority Leader \uc2 Nancy Pelosi\uc2  (D-Calif) calling it an attempt to pull attention away from pressing issues such as health care. On Tuesday, House Speaker \uc2 Paul D. Ryan\uc2  (R-Wis.) said in a radio interview that "you cannot end birthright citizenship with an executive order."\par \par \uc2 [ Birthright citizenship: A Trump-inspired history lesson on the 14th Amendment ]\par \par \uc2 The Immigration Stabilization Act that Reid championed died in committee. During a House floor speech in 2006, Reid apologized for introducing the measure, calling it a mistake and the "low point" of his legislative career. According to the Las Vegas Sun, Reid also said in 2006 he'd been persuaded by a group of people who "convinced us that the thing to do would be to close the borders between Mexico and the United States."\par \par \uc2 As The Post's Jacqueline Alemany noted, the debate over birthright citizenship has come up anew over the years, with Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R.-S.C.) bringing it up in 2010, \uc2 Rep. Steve King\uc2  (R-Iowa) last year, and Trump himself bringing it up repeatedly himself.\par \par \uc2 On Wednesday, Reid, who served as the Senate majority leader from 2007 to 2015, reiterated in a statement that his 1993 comments were a "mistake."\par \par \uc2 "After I proposed that awful bill, my wife Landra immediately sat me down and said, 'Harry, what are you doing, don't you know that my father is an immigrant?' She set me straight," Reid wrote, adding that immigrants are the "lifeblood" of the United States.\par \par \uc2 "This president wants to destroy not build, to stoke hatred instead of unify. He can tweet whatever he wants while he sits around watching TV, but he is profoundly wrong."\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020181031eeav00g1t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 A-Section\par {\*\bkmkstart toc40}{\*\bkmkend toc40}\b \uc2 An American echo in father and daughter's divide\b0\par\par\uc2 Greg Jaffe \par \uc2 1,942 \uc2 words\par \uc2 31 October 2018\par \uc2 The Washington Post\par \uc2 WP\par \uc2 FINAL\par A01\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2018, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved \par \par \uc2 PITTSBURGH - For Julia Santucci, there was without question a connection between what she saw as President Trump's "fearmongering" about an immigrant invasion and the deadliest attack on American Jews in the nation's history, a few miles from her home.\par \par \uc2 "You're fomenting a type of hatred that others take too far," said Julia, a senior lecturer at the University of Pittsburgh, of the president and his most ardent backers.\par \par \uc2 Her father, an insurance broker and lifelong Republican, believed that line of thought made little sense. Trump could often be blunt and crude, but Rocco Santucci did not believe he was racist, anti- Semitic or even anti-immigrant. In his view, Trump was no more to blame for the killings than Democratic politicians who also stoked Americans' fears.\par \par \uc2 "Trump's a shrewd guy," Rocco said of the president. "He picks what sells."\par \par \uc2 The debate between father and daughter this week mirrored the one that played out in bars, houses of worship, universities and at dinner tables in this city that Trump has held up as a metaphor for his kind of America.\par \par \uc2 "I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris," he said a little more than a year ago when he withdrew the United States from a global accord on climate change.\par \par \uc2 Trump's view of Pittsburgh as a symbol of the might of American manufacturing was largely misplaced. The last big steel mill here was abandoned in 1998. Today, the land it occupied, just across the street from a test track for driverless cars, is being redeveloped as a low-carbon-footprint technology park.\par \par \uc2 But Pittsburgh and its surrounding suburbs are a reflection of something else - a country so divided that many here are asking whether the president, his raucous "build the wall" rallies and his most ardent and angry supporters bear some culpability for one of the worst tragedies in the city's history. Others bristle with anger at the suggestion.\par \par \uc2 That dispute played out most publicly in the disagreement over whether Trump should come to the city and play the traditional consoling role expected of presidents in moments of tragedy. On Monday, before Trump and the first lady announced that they would come here on Tuesday, Mayor \uc2 Bill Peduto\uc2  (D) said the White House should consider the "will of the families" of those who died. He asked that a presidential visit not happen "while we are burying the dead."\par \par \uc2 But the divide is also evident in more subtle ways. One involved Julia, 38, who on the Monday after the shooting was thinking about her 69-year-old father. He had been the chairman of the Ross Township Republican Committee in the 1980s and had volunteered on behalf of President \uc2 Ronald Reagan\uc2 . Through the 1990s and the 2000s, they argued - sometimes heatedly - about politics.\par \par \uc2 Lately, though, they had found it harder and harder to even discuss Trump. "My dad is a lifelong Republican but not a Trump Republican," she said, pausing. "I think." She knew with certainty that her father had voted for Reagan, both Bushes, \uc2 John McCain\uc2  and \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 But in the 2016 election, for the first time in her life, she wasn't certain who he voted for. "I didn't ask," she said.\par \par \uc2 Did she really want to know?\par \par \uc2 "I don't know," she said. "It's hard not to take these things personally. . . . It's hard not to view a vote for Trump as a rejection of the things I value."\par \par \uc2 America's biggest tragedies often provoke moments of "thoughtful introspection and self-examination that we so rarely see in public life," President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  said in the wake of the killing of nine worshipers at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C., three years ago.\par \par \uc2 The Charleston shooting provoked a discussion about race and the Confederate battle flag. In the aftermath of the attack, South Carolina lawmakers, led by then-Gov. Nikki Haley (R), voted overwhelmingly to remove the banner from the state capitol.\par \par \uc2 The 2012 slaughter of 20 children and six adult staff members at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut renewed a national debate about whether private ownership of assault weapons and high-capacity magazines should be permitted and whether mental-health-care services in the country should be bolstered.\par \par \uc2 The killing of 11 worshipers from ages 54 to 97 in Pittsburgh has made some of those debates resurface. The "common denominator of every mass shooting in America" is guns, said Peduto, the mayor of this overwhelmingly Democratic city, in the immediate aftermath of the tragedy. Trump countered that the answer was more guns and more armed guards in places that might be vulnerable.\par \par \uc2 But this violent incident, far more than any previous attack, has opened a fresh discussion: about the role that America's toxic politics may have played in radicalizing the suspected shooter.\par \par \uc2 Taylor Seybolt, an international affairs professor at the University of Pittsburgh, dedicated his class Monday to the shooting. "What is it you want or need to know?" he asked his students.\par \par \uc2 Many wondered whether the suspect's anti-Semitic beliefs were inflamed by the heated political rhetoric surrounding a caravan of several thousand immigrants coming from Latin America and headed to the United States, Seybolt said. Trump has often characterized the caravan as an "invasion," and others such as \uc2 Rep. Matt Gaetz\uc2  (R-Fla.) speculated before the killings that \uc2 George Soros\uc2  - the wealthy Jewish philanthropist - might be funding the caravan.\par \par \uc2 Beyond the university's walls, the discussion quickly morphed into a debate over whether Trump should visit Pittsburgh. "President Trump, you are not welcome in Pittsburgh until you cease your assault on immigrants and refugees," a group of Jewish progressive leaders called Bend The Arc wrote in an open letter to the president. The group's online petition gathered more than 40,000 signatures.\par \par \uc2 The debate also played out on local talk radio, where it was broken up by ads for host Glenn Beck's "Addicted to Outrage" tour, which was scheduled to make a stop in Pittsburgh on Saturday.\par \par \uc2 "Should Trump come?" one KDKA radio host asked Monday morning. "Would he be welcome?"\par \par \uc2 "I need him now," said a caller, who identified herself as a Jewish resident of Squirrel Hill, the close-knit neighborhood where the killings happened. "It's horrible that I have to go to all these people's shiva houses and hold them."\par \par \uc2 On Monday, Rabbi Jeffrey Myers of Tree of Life synagogue, the site of the shooting, weighed in.\par \par \uc2 "Hate is not political," Myers told The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2 . "It is not blue or red, it's not male or female, it doesn't know any of those divisions."\par \par \uc2 For Julia and her father, Rocco, the debate over whether Trump should visit Pittsburgh led someplace more personal.\par \par \uc2 She and her father often argued heatedly about politics, particularly after her politics shifted left in college, but they shared a common belief in the importance of a strong national defense. After graduate school at the \uc2 University of Arizona\uc2 , Julia joined the CIA as an analyst. She did a stint at the White House from 2012 to 2014, where she focused on Egypt policy.\par \par \uc2 "In Egypt, you could see how political leaders create a culture that allowed violence to flourish," she said.\par \par \uc2 As the years passed, her father made a vow not to talk about politics with his daughter on the phone, where they both grew too heated.\par \par \uc2 "We love each other very much," he said. "But our differences in politics are many."\par \par \uc2 One exception came the day after the election in November 2016. On the phone that day, her father said, a devastated Julia told him that Trump's election made her feel "unsafe" as a woman.\par \par \uc2 To her father, her concerns seemed overstated and even foolish. "The country is not going to change because this guy is president," he recalled telling her.\par \par \uc2 In August 2017, Julia and her husband returned home to Pittsburgh, where they had both grown up.\par \par \uc2 She and her father couldn't avoid Trump's divisive presidency. Rocco had initially brushed off Trump's candidacy as "a joke." But he saw a lot to like in the way Trump was running the country. "He says things to stir people up, and, boy, does he ever," Rocco said. "But what's happening in the country is good. The economy has gone well. Internationally, things are going well."\par \par \uc2 Julia got the news of the killings from an alert on her phone. "Horror, but not surprise" is how she described her reaction. "It's become all too common in America."\par \par \uc2 Rocco's Internet was down, so he found out about the attack from the Verizon repairman. He quickly checked the news on his phone, and a short time later, he learned that one of the dead was his longtime dentist, Richard Gottfried, whose wife, Peg, sometimes attended his church.\par \par \uc2 At Mass on Sunday, Rocco's priest called the attack an act of "utter horror and total cowardice." On Monday, the news on Rocco's phone was still full of reports about the killings in Pittsburgh and the immigrant caravan headed toward the southern border of the United States. The website he was reading said the convoy was growing larger, although reporters at the scene said it was actually shrinking.\par \par \uc2 Rocco had helped raise money for refugee families through Catholic Charities of Pittsburgh. He didn't consider himself anti-immigrant. Nor did he think Trump's views were significantly out of step with the country.\par \par \uc2 "A majority of Americans are not anti-immigrant. They are anti-\uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2 ," he said. But, he asked, "does anyone really believe that we should let all these people in?"\par \par \uc2 The answer, he said, was to stop it "by any means necessary."\par \par \uc2 Julia saw Trump's rhetoric on this issue and so many others differently. Earlier this month, the president had described the caravan as being full of criminals and "Middle Easterners" and warned that its approach was a "national emergency."\par \par \uc2 To Julia, such hysteria inflamed the worst passions in Americans. And now that hysteria has spilled into a synagogue in her hometown.\par \par \uc2 "Can you support a Republican candidate and not support the fearmongering aspects of the party?" she asked on Monday, two days after the shooting. "It's really hard. I personally would say no. But I can look at people like my parents. They are not hate-filled people. . . . This type of hate spewing is not who they are."\par \par \uc2 Julia never asked her father about his vote in 2016, and he never volunteered it. They talked often and avoided the topic.\par \par \uc2 Rocco said he believed that \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  was "dangerous" and that Trump would be better for the country. But in the privacy of the voting booth, he said, he pulled the lever for Clinton "for Julia's sake."\par \par \uc2 On Monday, after telling a Post reporter who he had voted for, Rocco called his daughter.\par \par \uc2 "It surprised me, too," Julia wrote in an email after learning of his father's decision two years earlier. "Although I am not surprised he prioritized family over politics."\par \par \uc2 That division healed, they both returned to the news of the day, refracted through the lens of Trump's unconventional presidency and the nation's unsettling politics.\par \par \uc2 Julia blamed Trump. Rocco saw a larger problem. "There are people on both sides of the spectrum who can't behave civilly, and that filters down to people," Rocco said. "That's why Trump was elected. People are just fed up."\par \par \uc2 greg.jaffe@washpost.com \par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com\par \par \uc2 WP20181031dividedpittsburgh\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020181031eeav0001q\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved \par \par \uc2 President Trump resurrected a much-debated but rarely tested legal question when he said he planned to issue an executive order that would end the automatic grant of citizenship to those born in this country to noncitizens.\par \par \uc2 Legal experts have debated for years how to interpret the citizenship clause of the Constitution's 14th Amendment, but the consensus is one-sided: Most agree with the long-held tradition that it grants citizenship to those born on U.S. soil.\par \par \uc2 The first section of the amendment says: "All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside."\par \par \uc2 Some legal scholars argue that the phrase "and subject to the jurisdiction thereof" seems to give the government some leeway to restrict the right, just as other constitutional principles can be limited.\par \par \uc2 But the mainstream opinion from both right and left is that it is more likely that a constitutional amendment, rather than federal legislation or an executive order, would be needed to change the birthright conferred on people born here.\par \par \uc2 "Regardless of whether birthright citizenship is a good idea, it's enshrined in the 14th Amendment and so would take another constitutional amendment to change," said Ilya Shapiro of the libertarian \uc2 Cato Institute\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "There's an active academic debate over whether mere legislation could change it with respect to illegal immigrants and tourists, but regardless it's not something that can be done by executive action alone," he said.\par \par \uc2 House Speaker \uc2 Paul D. Ryan\uc2  (R-Wis.) and other conservatives generally favorable to Trump agreed with that assessment. Some wondered if such an executive order was actually being drafted, but it is a certainty that it would be immediately challenged.\par \par \uc2 "Aside from being unconstitutional, such an executive order would exacerbate racial tensions, exploit fears and drive further polarization across the country at a moment that calls for unity and inclusion," said \uc2 Kristen Clarke\uc2 , president and executive director of the \uc2 Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law\uc2 . "It is hard to imagine an executive order that would be more ill-timed or misguided given recent events across the country."\par \par \uc2 Trump has made immigration a favorite topic in advance of next week's midterm elections, and he said in an interview released Tuesday that advisers have told him that he has the power to end birthright citizenship.\par \par \uc2 "It was always told to me that you needed a constitutional amendment. Guess what? You don't," Trump told Axios in an interview scheduled to air as part of a new HBO series starting this weekend.\par \par \uc2 When told that his view is disputed, Trump asserted: "You can definitely do it with an act of Congress. But now they're saying I can do it just with an executive order."\par \par \uc2 In the part of the interview that was released, it was not clear whether Trump would seek to deny citizenship to the baby of any noncitizen or just to the children of people who are in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 The most-cited Supreme Court decision on the issue is the 1898 case United States v. Wong Kim Ark. The court held that a child born to Chinese immigrants who were legal residents was a birthright U.S. citizen under the 14th Amendment.\par \par \uc2 Related, but less directly on point, was the 1982 case Plyler v. Doe, which held that denying \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  children admission to public schools would violate the 14th Amendment's equal-protection clause.\par \par \uc2 Justice William Brennan, writing for the majority in the 5-to-4 decision, noted language from the Wong Kim Ark decision.\par \par \uc2 He said that "no plausible distinction with respect to Fourteenth Amendment 'jurisdiction' can be drawn between resident aliens whose entry into the United States was lawful, and resident aliens whose entry was unlawful."\par \par \uc2 But modern Supreme Courts simply have not been presented with the issue, so it is unclear how the current justices would see it.\par \par \uc2 Some legal experts question whether the 14th Amendment provides such a broad mandate and say the law granting citizenship has developed without real input from Congress.\par \par \uc2 The 14th Amendment granted citizenship to recently freed slaves, and it was an answer to the Supreme Court's now-discredited Dred Scott ruling, which said that no person of African descent, even if born in this country, could ever become a citizen.\par \par \uc2 But some legal analysts have said that does not mean all born in this country are automatically citizens.\par \par \uc2 Michael Anton, a former national security official in the Trump administration, made the case in an op-ed in The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2 : "The notion that simply being born within the geographical limits of the United States automatically confers U.S. citizenship is an absurdity - historically, constitutionally, philosophically and practically," he wrote.\par \par \uc2 Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) applauded Trump for raising the issue.\par \par \uc2 "This policy is a magnet for illegal immigration, out of the mainstream of the developed world, and needs to come to an end," he said. "I plan to introduce legislation along the same lines as the proposed executive order from president."\par \par \uc2 In 1995, under President \uc2 Bill Clinton\uc2 , the \uc2 Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel\uc2  took the position that birthright citizenship could not be denied absent a constitutional change. "Because the rule of citizenship acquired by birth within the United States is the law of the Constitution, it cannot be changed through legislation, but only by amending the Constitution," then-Assistant Attorney General Walter Dellinger told Congress.\par \par \uc2 He said congressional attempts to deny citizenship would be unconstitutional. "We cannot and should not try to solve the difficult problems illegal immigration poses by denying citizenship to persons whose claim to be recognized as Americans rests on the same constitutional footing as that of any natural-born citizen," he said.\par \par \uc2 Even some conservative legal analysts favored by Trump said that the 14th Amendment grant of citizenship was beyond dispute.\par \par \uc2 James C. Ho, a conservative recently nominated by Trump and confirmed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, is among them.\par \par \uc2 "Birthright citizenship is guaranteed by the 14th Amendment," he wrote in a 2006 essay. "That birthright is protected no less for children of undocumented persons than for descendants of Mayflower passengers."\par \par \uc2 robert.barnes@washpost.com \par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com\par \par \uc2 WP20181031birthright1031\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020181031eeav0001d\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National-Politics\par {\*\bkmkstart toc42}{\*\bkmkend toc42}\b \uc2 A mass shooting in Pittsburgh and a Trump visit expose a divided America\b0\par\par\uc2 By Greg Jaffe \par \uc2 1,948 \uc2 words\par \uc2 31 October 2018\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2018, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 PITTSBURGH \u8212\'20\'14 For Julia Santucci, there was without question a connection between what she saw as President Trump's "fearmongering" about an immigrant invasion and the deadliest attack on American Jews in the nation's history, a few miles from her home.\par \par \uc2 "You're fomenting a type of hatred that others take too far," said Julia, a senior lecturer at the University of Pittsburgh, of the president and his most ardent backers.\par \par \uc2 Her father, an insurance broker and lifelong Republican, believed that line of thought made little sense. Trump could often be blunt and crude, but Rocco Santucci did not believe he was racist, anti-Semitic or even anti-immigrant. In his view, Trump was no more to blame for the killings than Democratic politicians who also stoked Americans' fears.\par \par \uc2 "Trump's a shrewd guy," Rocco said of the president. "He picks what sells."\par \par \uc2 The debate between father and daughter this week mirrored the one that played out in bars, houses of worship, universities and at dinner tables in this city that Trump has held up as a metaphor for his kind of America.\par \par \uc2 "I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris," he said a little more than a year ago when he withdrew the United States from a global accord on climate change.\par \par \uc2 Trump's view of Pittsburgh as a symbol of the might of American manufacturing was largely misplaced. The last big steel mill here was abandoned in 1998. Today, the land it occupied, just across the street from a test track for driverless cars, is being redeveloped as a low-carbon-footprint technology park.\par \par \uc2 But Pittsburgh and its surrounding suburbs are a reflection of something else \u8212\'20\'14 a country so divided that many here are asking whether the president, his raucous "build the wall" rallies and his most ardent and angry supporters bear some culpability for one of the worst tragedies in the city's history. Others bristle with anger at the suggestion.\par \par \uc2 That dispute played out most publicly in the disagreement over whether Trump should come to the city and play the traditional consoling role expected of presidents in moments of tragedy. On Monday, before Trump and the first lady announced that they would come here on Tuesday, Mayor \uc2 Bill Peduto\uc2  (D) said the White House should consider the "will of the families" of those who died. He asked that a presidential visit not happen "while we are burying the dead."\par \par \uc2 But the divide is also evident in more subtle ways. One involved Julia, 38, who on the Monday after the shooting was thinking about her 69-year-old father. He had been the chairman of the Ross Township Republican Committee in the 1980s and had volunteered on behalf of President \uc2 Ronald Reagan\uc2 . Through the 1990s and the 2000s, they argued \u8212\'20\'14 sometimes heatedly \u8212\'20\'14 about politics.\par \par \uc2 Lately, though, they had found it harder and harder to even discuss Trump. "My dad is a lifelong Republican but not a Trump Republican," she said, pausing. "I think." She knew with certainty that her father had voted for Reagan, both Bushes, \uc2 John McCain\uc2  and \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 But in the 2016 election, for the first time in her life, she wasn't certain who he voted for. "I didn't ask," she said.\par \par \uc2 Did she really want to know?\par \par \uc2 "I don't know," she said. "It's hard not to take these things personally. .\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09. It's hard not to view a vote for Trump as a rejection of the things I value."\par \par \uc2 America's biggest tragedies often provoke moments of "thoughtful introspection and self-examination that we so rarely see in public life," President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  said in the wake of the killing of nine worshipers at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C., three years ago.\par \par \uc2 The Charleston shooting provoked a discussion about race and the Confederate battle flag. In the aftermath of the attack, South Carolina lawmakers, led by then-Gov. Nikki Haley (R), voted overwhelmingly to remove the banner from the state capitol.\par \par \uc2 The 2012 slaughter of 20 children and six adult staff members at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut renewed a national debate about whether private ownership of assault weapons and high-capacity magazines should be permitted and whether mental-health-care services in the country should be bolstered.\par \par \uc2 The killing of 11 worshipers from ages 54 to 97 in Pittsburgh has made some of those debates resurface. The "common denominator of every mass shooting in America" is guns, said Peduto, the mayor of this overwhelmingly Democratic city, in the immediate aftermath of the tragedy. Trump countered that the answer was more guns and more armed guards in places that might be vulnerable.\par \par \uc2 But this violent incident, far more than any previous attack, has opened a fresh discussion: about the role that America's toxic politics may have played in radicalizing the suspected shooter.\par \par \uc2 Taylor Seybolt, an international affairs professor at the University of Pittsburgh, dedicated his class Monday to the shooting. "What is it you want or need to know?" he asked his students.\par \par \uc2 Many wondered whether the suspect's anti-Semitic beliefs were inflamed by the heated political rhetoric surrounding a caravan of several thousand immigrants coming from Latin America and headed to the United States, Seybolt said. Trump has often characterized the caravan as an "invasion," and others such as \uc2 Rep. Matt Gaetz\uc2  (R-Fla.) speculated before the killings that \uc2 George Soros\uc2  \u8212\'20\'14 the wealthy Jewish philanthropist \u8212\'20\'14 might be funding the caravan.\par \par \uc2 Beyond the university's walls, the discussion quickly morphed into a debate over whether Trump should visit Pittsburgh. "President Trump, you are not welcome in Pittsburgh until you cease your assault on immigrants and refugees," a group of Jewish progressive leaders called Bend The Arc wrote in an open letter to the president. The group's online petition gathered more than 80,000 signatures as of Tuesday night.\par \par \uc2 The debate also played out on local talk radio, where it was broken up by ads for host Glenn Beck's "Addicted to Outrage" tour, which was scheduled to make a stop in Pittsburgh on Saturday.\par \par \uc2 "Should Trump come?" one KDKA radio host asked Monday morning. "Would he be welcome?"\par \par \uc2 "I need him now," said a caller, who identified herself as a Jewish resident of Squirrel Hill, the close-knit neighborhood where the killings happened. "It's horrible that I have to go to all these people's shiva houses and hold them."\par \par \uc2 On Monday, Rabbi Jeffrey Myers of Tree of Life synagogue, the site of the shooting, weighed in.\par \par \uc2 "Hate is not political," Myers told The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2 . "It is not blue or red, it's not male or female, it doesn't know any of those divisions."\par \par \uc2 For Julia and her father, Rocco, the debate over whether Trump should visit Pittsburgh led someplace more personal.\par \par \uc2 She and her father often argued heatedly about politics, particularly after her politics shifted left in college, but they shared a common belief in the importance of a strong national defense. After graduate school at the \uc2 University of Arizona\uc2 , Julia joined the CIA as an analyst. She did a stint at the White House from 2012 to 2014, where she focused on Egypt policy.\par \par \uc2 "In Egypt, you could see how political leaders create a culture that allowed violence to flourish," she said.\par \par \uc2 As the years passed, her father made a vow not to talk about politics with his daughter on the phone, where they both grew too heated.\par \par \uc2 "We love each other very much," he said. "But our differences in politics are many."\par \par \uc2 One exception came the day after the election in November 2016. On the phone that day, her father said, a devastated Juliatold him that Trump's election made her feel "unsafe" as a woman.\par \par \uc2 To her father, her concerns seemed overstated and even foolish. "The country is not going to change because this guy is president," he recalled telling her.\par \par \uc2 In August 2017, Julia and her husband returned home to Pittsburgh, where they had both grown up.\par \par \uc2 She and her father couldn't avoid Trump's divisive presidency. Rocco had initially brushed off Trump's candidacy as "a joke." But he saw a lot to like in the way Trump was running the country. "He says things to stir people up, and, boy, does he ever," Rocco said. "But what's happening in the country is good. The economy has gone well. Internationally, things are going well."\par \par \uc2 Julia got the news of the killings from an alert on her phone. "Horror, but not surprise" is how she described her reaction. "It's become all too common in America."\par \par \uc2 Rocco's Internet was down, so he found out about the attack from the Verizon repairman. He quickly checked the news on his phone, and a short time later, he learned that one of the dead was his longtime dentist, Richard Gottfried, whose wife, Peg, sometimes attended his church.\par \par \uc2 At Mass on Sunday, Rocco's priest called the attack an act of "utter horror and total cowardice." On Monday, the news on Rocco's phone was still full of reports about the killings in Pittsburgh and the immigrant caravan headed toward the southern border of the United States. The website he was reading said the convoy was growing larger, although reporters at the scene said it was actually shrinking.\par \par \uc2 Rocco had helped raise money for refu\u173\'00\'ADgee families through Catholic Charities of Pittsburgh. He didn't consider himself anti-immigrant. Nor did he think Trump's views were significantly out of step with the country.\par \par \uc2 "A majority of Americans are not anti-immigrant. They are anti-\uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2 ," he said. But, he asked, "does anyone really believe that we should let all these people in?"\par \par \uc2 The answer, he said, was to stop it "by any means necessary."\par \par \uc2 Julia saw Trump's rhetoric on this issue and so many others differently. Earlier this month, the president had described the caravan as being full of criminals and "Middle Easterners" and warned that its approach was a "national emergency."\par \par \uc2 To Julia, such hysteria inflamed the worst passions in Americans. And now that hysteria has spilled into a synagogue in her hometown.\par \par \uc2 "Can you support a Republican candidate and not support the fearmongering aspects of the party?" she asked on Monday, two days after the shooting. "It's really hard. I personally would say no. But I can look at people like my parents. They are not hate-filled people. .\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09. This type of hate spewing is not who they are."\par \par \uc2 Julia never asked her fatherabout his vote in 2016,and he never volunteered it. They talked often and avoided the topic.\par \par \uc2 Rocco saidhe believed that \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  was "dangerous" and that Trump would be better for the country. But in the privacy of the voting booth, he said, he pulled the lever for Clinton "for Julia's sake."\par \par \uc2 On Monday, after telling a Post reporter who he had voted for, Rocco called his daughter.\par \par \uc2 "It surprised me, too," Julia wrote in an email after learning of his father's decision two years earlier. "Although I am not surprised he prioritized family over politics."\par \par \uc2 That division healed, they both returned to the news of the day, refracted through the lens of Trump's unconventional presidency and the nation's unsettling politics.\par \par \uc2 Julia blamed Trump. Rocco saw a larger problem. "There are people on both sides of the spectrum who can't behave civilly, and that filters down to people," Rocco said. "That's why Trump was elected. People are just fed up."\par \par \uc2 greg.jaffe@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020181030eeau00hld\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 President Trump resurrected a much-debated but rarely tested legal question when he said he planned to issue an executive order that would end the automatic grant of citizenship to those born in this country to noncitizens.\par \par \uc2 Legal experts have debated for years how to interpret the citizenship clause of the Constitution's 14th Amendment, but the consensus is one-sided: Most agree with the long-held tradition that it grants citizenship to those born on U.S. soil.\par \par \uc2 The first section of the amendment says: "All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside."\par \par \uc2 Some legal scholars argue that the phrase "and subject to the jurisdiction thereof" seems to give the government some leeway to restrict the right, just as other constitutional principles can be limited.\par \par \uc2 But the mainstream opinion from both right and left is that it is more likely that a constitutional amendment, rather than federal legislation or an executive order, would be needed to change the birthright conferred on people born here.\par \par \uc2 "Regardless of whether birthright citizenship is a good idea, it's enshrined in the 14th Amendment and so would take another constitutional amendment to change," said Ilya Shapiro of the libertarian \uc2 Cato Institute\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "There's an active academic debate over whether mere legislation could change it with respect to illegal immigrants and tourists, but regardless it's not something that can be done by executive action alone," he said.\par \par \uc2 House Speaker \uc2 Paul D. Ryan\uc2  (R-Wis.) and other conservatives generally favorable to Trump agreed with that assessment. Some wondered if such an executive order was actually being drafted, but it is a certainty that it would be immediately challenged.\par \par \uc2 "Aside from being unconstitutional, such an executive order would exacerbate racial tensions, exploit fears and drive further polarization across the country at a moment that calls for unity and inclusion," said \uc2 Kristen Clarke\uc2 , president and executive director of the \uc2 Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law\uc2 . "It is hard to imagine an executive order that would be more ill-timed or misguided given recent events across the country."\par \par \uc2 Trump has made immigration a favorite topic in advance of next week's midterm elections, and he said in an interview released Tuesday that advisers have told him that he has the power to end birthright citizenship.\par \par \uc2 "It was always told to me that you needed a constitutional amendment. Guess what? You don't," Trump told Axios in an interview scheduled to air as part of a new HBO series starting this weekend.\par \par \uc2 When told that his view is disputed, Trump asserted: "You can definitely do it with an act of Congress. But now they're saying I can do it just with an executive order."\par \par \uc2 In the part of the interview that was released, it was not clear whether Trump would seek to deny citizenship to the baby of any noncitizen or just to the children of people who are in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 The most-cited Supreme Court decision on the issue is the 1898 case United States v. Wong Kim Ark. The court held that a child born to Chinese immigrants who were legal residents was a birthright U.S. citizen under the 14th Amendment.\par \par \uc2 Related, but less directly on point, was the 1982 case Plyler v. Doe, which held that denying \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  children admission to public schools would violate the 14th Amendment's equal-protection clause.\par \par \uc2 Justice William Brennan, writing for the majority in the 5-to-4 decision, noted language from the Wong Kim Ark decision.\par \par \uc2 He said that "no plausible distinction with respect to Fourteenth Amendment 'jurisdiction' can be drawn between resident aliens whose entry into the United States was lawful, and resident aliens whose entry was unlawful."\par \par \uc2 But modern Supreme Courts simply have not been presented with the issue, so it is unclear how the current justices would see it.\par \par \uc2 Some legal experts question whether the 14th Amendment provides such a broad mandate and say the law granting citizenship has developed without real input from Congress.\par \par \uc2 The 14th Amendment granted citizenship to recently freed slaves, and was an answer to the Supreme Court's now-discredited Dred Scott ruling, which said that no person of African descent, even if born in this country, could ever become a citizen.\par \par \uc2 But some legal analysts have said that does not mean all born in this country are automatically citizens.\par \par \uc2 Michael Anton, a former national security official in the Trump administration, made the case in an op-ed in The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2 : "The notion that simply being born within the geographical limits of the United States automatically confers U.S. citizenship is an absurdity \u8212\'20\'14 historically, constitutionally, philosophically and practically," he wrote.\par \par \uc2 Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) applauded Trump for raising the issue.\par \par \uc2 "This policy is a magnet for illegal immigration, out of the mainstream of the developed world, and needs to come to an end," he said. "I plan to introduce legislation along the same lines as the proposed executive order from president."\par \par \uc2 In 1995, under President \uc2 Bill Clinton\uc2 , the \uc2 Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel\uc2  took the position that birthright citizenship could not be denied absent a constitutional change. "Because the rule of citizenship acquired by birth within the United States is the law of the Constitution, it cannot be changed through legislation, but only by amending the Constitution," then-Assistant Attorney General Walter Dellinger told Congress.\par \par \uc2 He said congressional attempts to deny citizenship would be unconstitutional. "We cannot and should not try to solve the difficult problems illegal immigration poses by denying citizenship to persons whose claim to be recognized as Americans rests on the same constitutional footing as that of any natural-born citizen," he said.\par \par \uc2 Even some conservative legal analysts favored by Trump said that the 14th Amendment grant of citizenship was beyond dispute.\par \par \uc2 James C. Ho, a conservative recently nominated by Trump and confirmed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, is among them.\par \par \uc2 "Birthright citizenship is guaranteed by the 14th Amendment," he wrote in a 2006 essay. "That birthright is protected no less for children of undocumented persons than for descendants of Mayflower passengers."\par \par \uc2 robert.barnes@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020181030eeau005h9\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 President Trump launched his long-shot presidential campaign in 2015 by declaring Mexican immigrants were drug dealers, criminals and rapists.\par \par \uc2 Three years later, Trump is again facing a tough campaign in which he \u8212\'20\'14 or, more accurately, his party \u8212\'20\'14 seems likely to face some heavy losses. And so, in the final weeks before November's midterm elections, Trump is falling back into his trademark hard-line anti-immigrant rhetoric.\par \par \uc2 The Fix compared Trump's Monday night speech in Texas to one he made as a presidential candidate and found that what Trump is saying in the past few weeks makes some of his 2016 rhetoric look fairly tame.\par \par \uc2 Whereas Trump in 2016 allowed for some nuance that, say, "some" immigrants in the country illegally might be good people, in 2018, he routinely describes cities "overrun" with violent, \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  gangs. In 2016, he focused plenty on murders allegedly committed at the hands of immigrants in the country illegally, but now, he seems to revel in describing the violence committed at the hands of immigrants in the country illegally. Whereas in 2016, the Washington establishment was to blame for all this, in 2018, it's the Democrats.\par \par \uc2 Driving votes through fear isn't a strategy Trump created, but it's one he's taken to a degree not seen before in national politics. This time it's driven by an urgency to help Republicans keep control of Congress.\par \par \uc2 Here's our look at Trump's rhetoric on illegal immigration in 2016, from a speech he gave in August after meeting with the president of Mexico, and from Monday night, from a rally he gave in Houston for Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.).\par \par \uc2 Trump, then: The politicians, in general. "The fundamental problem with the immigration system in our country is that it serves the needs of wealthy donors, political activists and powerful politicians. Let me tell you who it doesn't serve: It doesn't serve you, the American people."\par \par \uc2 Trump, now: The Democrats, unequivocally. Trump repeats blatant falsehoods that Democrats want to allow undocumented immigrants to vote or are giving a caravan of Central American migrants in Mexico money to continue. "As we speak, the Democrat Party is openly encouraging millions of illegal aliens to break our laws, violate our borders and overwhelm our nation. That's what's happening. The Democrats have launched an assault on the sovereignty of our country, the security of our nation and the safety of every single American."\par \par \uc2 Trump, then: He wasn't really that specific. "Immigration reform should mean something else entirely: It should mean improvements to our laws and policies to make life better for American citizens."\par \par \uc2 Trump, now: Closed borders! Or else . . . "We have to protect our borders. We don't have borders, we don't have a country. We have to protect our borders."\par \par \uc2 Trump, then: Let's talk about it. "We also have to be honest about the fact that not everyone who seeks to join our country will be able to successfully assimilate. It is our right as a sovereign nation to choose immigrants that we think are the likeliest to thrive and flourish here."\par \par \uc2 Trump, now: He consistently bashes two immigration laws that most members of Congress, Republicans included, have long supported: family migration and a visa-lottery system. "You know what visa lottery is? Countries put name in a batch and you pick them. You pick them. You keep picking them. And then you got nothing but problems, because you think those countries are putting their finest? I don't think so. It's a great way to dispose of their problems. Visa lottery. And then you have chain migration."\par \par \uc2 Trump, then: It was a big focus of his campaign. He routinely highlighted some of the most gruesome murders, allegedly at the hands of undocumented immigrants. "In California, a 64-year-old Air Force veteran, Marilyn Pharis, was sexually assaulted and beaten to death with a hammer. Her killer had been arrested on multiple occasions, but was never deported."\par \par \uc2 Trump, now: He seems to revel in describing the violence, which he dwells on in even more detail. " A guy comes in, as an example, West Side Highway in Manhattan. That's where I am. Beautiful park, beautiful highway. This animal is driving a car down, and he decides he's going to make a right, right into the park where everyone is working out, exercising, running, bicycling. And he knocks everything down, including kills eight people. And badly wounds \u8212\'20\'14 you ever notice they never talk about the people that are wounded, where they lose their arms, and their legs, and their lives can never be the same? They never talk. They say eight people died. They don't talk about the 12 people that lost something so important.\par \par \uc2 "These are people that are in a park where they go to exercise so they can be in perfect shape. And they go home months later without their legs, without their arms. Because this animal going at a very fast speed just decided he's going to make a right into the park and run people over.\par \par \uc2 "So he has 22 people that came in, because he's here. So he's here. It's called chain, a chain, nice name, chain migration. He's here. His mother comes with him, his father then comes, his uncle, his aunt, his brother, his nephew, his sister, 22 people. No jobs. Just 22 people."\par \par \uc2 Trump, then: He allowed for some nuance. "While there are many illegal immigrants in our country who are good people, this doesn't change the fact that most illegal immigrants are lower-skilled workers with less education who compete directly against vulnerable American workers, and that these illegal workers draw much more out from the system than they will ever pay in.\par \par \uc2 Trump, now: Definitely not. This week he described a group of Central American families walking through Mexico seeking asylum as an "onslaught of illegal aliens," even suggesting in veiled language some might be terrorists. And he talks about cities being "overrun" with gangs of illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 "We've removed thousands, thousands of them. They came in through the wonderful Obama administration. We removed thousands and thousands of these people. And the towns are liberated. And you see the people, they're clapping from their window. I'm telling you, it's like a war. It's like a war zone."\par \par \uc2 Later: "They're people. They carve you up with a knife, but they're people."\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020181023eean00565\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National-Politics\par {\*\bkmkstart toc45}{\*\bkmkend toc45}\b \uc2 Welcome to the Fear Election (for the third election in a row) \b0\par\par\uc2 By Philip Bump \par \uc2 1,105 \uc2 words\par \uc2 23 October 2018\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2018, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 President Trump's intent is not subtle.\par \par \uc2 When Trump tweets, as he did Monday morning, that "criminals and unknown Middle Easterners are mixed in" with the caravan of migrants that crossed into Mexico over the weekend, you know what he's getting at. He's getting at the same thing he's been getting at since June 16, 2015, when he walked up to the microphone at his campaign launch in Trump Tower and proceeded to excoriate immigrants from Mexico as criminal by default. He's getting at the same thing he got at in December that year, when he called for a ban on Muslim migrants to the United States, implying that Muslims were inherently dangerous in other ways. It was his campaign platform explicitly: I will protect you from the scary things out there in the world \u8212\'20\'14 and here are some things to be scared of.\par \par \uc2 To those who've been reporting on the caravan, the announcement of infiltration by criminals and "Middle Easterners" came as a surprise. Out of a group of several thousand, there are likely to be some people who have committed crimes. As for the alleged "Middle Easterners," reporters have expressed some bafflement.\par \par \uc2 There were some people from Bangladesh in the caravan who had been detained, according to a Daily Caller report citing a reporter from \uc2 Univision\uc2 . The Daily Caller report seemed aimed at bolstering the president's tweet, including a section noting the existence of terrorism linked to Islam in Bangladesh. But, of course, Trump didn't technically say terrorists \u8212\'20\'14 he said "Middle Easterners," and, if nothing else, Bangladesh isn't in the Middle East.\par \par \uc2 There have been reports centered on the caravan claiming that the Islamic State has a presence in it. They appear to be focused on comments from the president of Guatemala, who, over the weekend, said that the country had captured 100 Islamic State terrorists but did not identify where or when. Right-wing sites quickly connected that claim to the caravan that was passing through Guatemala, often willfully blurring the two together.\par \par \uc2 (\uc2 Politico\uc2 's Blake Hounshell made a valid point about this: If you're an Islamic State terrorist from the Middle East, why would you join one of the most public and scrutinized migrations northward if you're seeking entry to the United States?)\par \par \uc2 Asked why he'd made the assertion, Trump offered an ironic response: "Take your cameras, go into the middle, and search" for them, he said. Trump has spent several weeks insisting that first his Supreme Court nominee \uc2 Brett M. Kavanaugh\uc2  and then the Saudi government should be considered innocent until proven guilty of allegations each faced. Here, as in June 2015, the presumption is guilt and the proof of innocence is up to others.\par \par \uc2 Again: The intent of Trump's tweet about the caravan is not subtle. Illegal immigration is the biggest problem identified by Republicans in a recent \uc2 Pew Research Center\uc2  survey, making the existence of the caravan a potent political tool. But with his tweets, Trump is also hoping to repeat an effective tactic for Republicans during the past two cycles: Make the election about fear of immigrants surging across the border.\par \par \uc2 In 2014, the fears were twofold. First was the Islamic State itself, often referred to as ISIS, which had surged into the public imagination with gruesome killings. Then, about a month before the midterm election that year, the Ebola virus reached the United States, overhauling the American public's fear hierarchy. Cable news networks quickly switched from one topic to the other \u8212\'20\'14 and then, after the election, mostly stopped talking about both of them.\par \par \uc2 In part, that was because the threats evolved or waned in the United States. In part, of course, it was also because their utility in the political conversation evaporated after the election was over. The threat of Ebola-infected or terrorism-sympathetic migrants \u8212\'20\'14 or both? \u8212\'20\'14 crossing the border was raised regularly by Republican candidates, however unlikely. (Among those using Ebola to criticize the administration of \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  was \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 , who advocated, among other things, barring any entry into the United States from West Africa.)\par \par \uc2 The total number of people who contracted Ebola in the United States and died in 2014, combined with the number of Americans killed by terrorists from the Islamic State that year, was zero.\par \par \uc2 Two years later, Trump deployed the rhetoric of fear more directly.\par \par \uc2 "I have a message for all of you: The crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soon \u8212\'20\'14 and I mean very soon \u8212\'20\'14 come to an end," Trump said while accepting his party's nomination in July 2016. "Beginning on January 20th, 2017, safety will be restored."\par \par \uc2 What was the "crime and violence" afflicting the United States? Per Trump's speech, it was "the attacks on our police, and the terrorism in our cities."\par \par \uc2 "The number of police officers killed in the line of duty has risen by almost 50 percent compared to this point last year," he said. "Nearly 180,000 illegal immigrants with criminal records, ordered deported from our country, are tonight roaming free to threaten peaceful citizens. The number of new \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  families who have crossed the border so far this year already exceeds the entire total from 2015."\par \par \uc2 There are plenty of asterisks to those assertions, but the politics were clear. On Election Day, \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  won voters whose biggest concern was the economy. Those who identified immigration or terrorism as the biggest issue facing the country \u8212\'20\'14 about 3 in 10 voters \u8212\'20\'14 backed Trump by 31 and 17 percentage points, respectively.\par \par \uc2 Trump has spent most of his presidency focused on what he presents as his successes \u8212\'20\'14 mainly the strength of the economy. But contentment is not a powerful motivator for voters. Now Trump presents a country that's under threat. Immigrants surging to the border, terrorists embedded among them. Angry Democratic mobs intent on turning the United States into Venezuela, as he likes to say. It's a tricky balancing act, arguing that the nation is at risk even as he is its steward.\par \par \uc2 But from a political standpoint, it's so unsurprising as to have been predictable. Nearly Trump's entire career in politics has been about presenting a tough face to a perceived threat.\par \par \uc2 Usually, though, that fear is only indirectly tied to politics. In another tweet Monday morning, Trump dropped whatever subtlety might have existed before.\par \par \uc2 If you're wondering what his reelection campaign will focus on in the final weeks, we have a guess.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020181022eeam00asy\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved \par \par \uc2 Joe Gomez didn't listen to his abuelita.\par \par \uc2 "What did I tell you, Joseph?" his grandmother asked him after Gomez's mistake made news. "What you're making is blood money."\par \par \uc2 Last year, Gomez, 32, left his job as a radio journalist to take a well-paid gig with the \uc2 Federation for American Immigration Reform\uc2  (FAIR), an organization that paints itself as moderate but has been called a hate group.\par \par \uc2 That's what worried Grandma.\par \par \uc2 "She's not someone you mess with. She's one of those rough-and-tumble grandmothers," he said, chastised and repentant.\par \par \uc2 After months of hoping to prove her wrong, after working in a place where "spic" and "hola hombre" were allegedly part of the workday, he finally told his grandma she was right.\par \par \uc2 Gomez quit, and last week he filed a complaint with the D.C. Office of Human Rights over what he described as the toxic work environment at FAIR.\par \par \uc2 "I was very optimistic, I thought I could make a difference," Gomez said. "There was change to be made, but I couldn't do it."\par \par \uc2 This is more than a cautionary tale about listening to your grandma.\par \par \uc2 And it's also more than a Trump voter with buyer's remorse. Gomez isn't Latinx Omarosa. No book deal, so far.\par \par \uc2 The frightening kernel inside Gomez's story and the point he wants to make is the septic and contagious polarity of Washington and how little it has to do with the majority of Americans' thinking.\par \par \uc2 We are, primarily, a nation of moderates, no matter how flaming your \uc2 Facebook\uc2  feed looks. A whopping 42 percent of Americans polled by Gallup last year said they were politically independent. The same poll had 29 percent going Democratic and 27 percent Republican.\par \par \uc2 But you look at Twitter or get to the District, and it feels like Fort Sumter on the eve of a second Civil War.\par \par \uc2 Gomez said he did not find a moderate middle at FAIR. Instead, according to the complaint he filed, he found himself in an extremist organization where jabs at people of color - like one woman who offered to smear mud on her face to look more like an immigrant - were more common than rational talk about immigration reform.\par \par \uc2 FAIR disputed Gomez's claim that he was treated unfairly.\par \par \uc2 "At all times Mr. Gomez was treated with dignity and respect at FAIR," said the organization's communications director, David Ray. "He was valued and sent around the country and given high-profile assignments."\par \par \uc2 Ray said that Gomez's formal complaint was the first FAIR heard about any problems and that its own investigation "reveals that his allegations against FAIR are, in all essentials, untrue."\par \par \uc2 Gomez said he started getting pushback at the job when he tried to say "\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 " on the air, rather than the "illegal alien" FAIR used. The bosses reprimanded him for not using their lingo, he said.\par \par \uc2 He stayed on, though. Not because he was a subversive leftie going undercover for the resistance - he's a Republican who voted for President Trump.\par \par \uc2 When he worked as a correspondent for radio stations like NBC News, he talked to people across the country, at the border and in Mexico. And he found most folks had genuinely middle-of-the-road philosophies. They're not all "round 'em up and kick them out," he said.\par \par \uc2 "Ultimately, people do believe in some sort of moderate immigration reform."\par \par \uc2 But that's not what he found in the caustic world of extreme Washington politics.\par \par \uc2 "The organizations have polarized," Gomez said. "Not the people. And the polarizing is very frightening."\par \par \uc2 When he showed up at FAIR to interview, the folks there couldn't believe their luck, he said. A man named Gomez? That would be gold for a place like FAIR.\par \par \uc2 "In the interview, they told me, 'You know we're a hate group,' " Gomez said, referring to the designation given to the organization by the \uc2 Southern Poverty Law Center\uc2 , which FAIR disputes.\par \par \uc2 The group was founded in 1979 and has since had quiet ties to white supremacist groups, while looking moderate during at least 100 appearances by its representatives to testify before congressional hearings, according to the SPLC.\par \par \uc2 "FAIR's founder, \uc2 John Tanton\uc2 , has expressed his wish that America remain a majority-white population: a goal to be achieved, presumably, by limiting the number of nonwhites who enter the country," according to the SPLC's description.\par \par \uc2 Growing up in Colorado, with an African American father and a Mexican American mother who were both in the military, Gomez said, he was never stung by bigotry and didn't believe folks could be so extreme. His fourth-generation American world felt pretty colorblind.\par \par \uc2 Then he got to FAIR. And no matter how many appearances he made for them on TV, no matter how many pro-Trump tweets he sent and no matter how many times he went out for drinks with colleagues, he said they treated him like an outsider.\par \par \uc2 The harassment got so bad, Gomez said, that he saw a doctor and began taking medication for his anxiety-driven, uncontrollable shaking.\par \par \uc2 Then, according to his complaint, his bosses made fun of his shaking.\par \par \uc2 "The bottom line was that my last name was Gomez," he said. "And no matter how much money I made for them, they still saw the color of my skin."\par \par \uc2 Gomez is suing for lost wages. FAIR also takes issue with the money part of the complaint, couching the whole affair as a cash grab. Gomez said that if he gets any cash, he'll donate it to an advocacy group.\par \par \uc2 And yes. Go ahead, get it out of the way. He's heard all the "I told you so's" one man can take.\par \par \uc2 "I've heard it all," he said. You lay with dogs, you'll get fleas. You hang out with vipers, you'll get bitten. He knows he looked naive when he took the job.\par \par \uc2 He prefers to believe he was being optimistic.\par \par \uc2 He went to the West Virginia mountains over the long weekend to get away and breathe. And think. And plan.\par \par \uc2 Gomez would like to go back to work. But not for a newsroom. And not for a place that says it's moderate.\par \par \uc2 "Advocacy. I think I would like to do that," he said. "Because now I've experienced hate firsthand."\par \par \uc2 He still believes he can make a difference.\par \par \uc2 petula.dvorak@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 Twitter: @petulad \par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com\par \par \uc2 WP20180904dvorak0904\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020180904ee940001h\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 In the days since Mollie Tibbetts's body was found covered with cornstalks in an Iowa field, her family has chosen to mourn mostly in private.\par \par \uc2 But on Saturday, nearly a week after burying the \uc2 University of Iowa\uc2  student, her family broke its silence to deliver a message to every politician who has used her death as an election-year talking point to attack illegal immigration:\par \par \uc2 Stop.\par \par \uc2 "I encourage the debate on immigration; there is great merit in its reasonable outcome," her father, Rob Tibbetts, wrote in an opinion column in the Des Moines Register. "But do not appropriate Mollie's soul in advancing views she believed were profoundly racist."\par \par \uc2 Rob Tibbetts said his family still needs time to mourn, and he asked for continued privacy. But he said he felt compelled to speak because politicians were using his daughter's name to promote views that she would be opposed to, actions he called "heartless," "despicable" and "shameless." The piece expanded on some of the comments he made at his daughter's funeral defending the Hispanic community.\par \par \uc2 "My stepdaughter, whom Mollie loved so dearly, is Latina. Her sons \u8212\'20\'14 Mollie's cherished nephews and my grandchildren \u8212\'20\'14 are Latino," Rob Tibbetts wrote in the piece, which ran a day after a column by Donald Trump Jr. in the same publication. " . . . To knowingly foment discord among races is a disgrace to our flag."\par \par \uc2 Mollie Tibbetts disappeared in July after she left for a jog. The man accused of killing her is in the country illegally and had worked on a dairy farm in Brooklyn, Iowa. He told detectives that he chased after her but that he blacked out and doesn't remember the assault. His only memory was finding a piece of her earphones in his lap and her body in his trunk, police said in court documents.\par \par \uc2 He led authorities to a spot deep in the cornfield where he had hidden the 20-year-old's body.\par \par \uc2 News of the dramatic and tragic discovery spread as President Trump's former campaign chairman and personal attorney were convicted of crimes in federal court. But in Tibbetts's death, the president and some conservatives found ammunition to defend his statements on illegal immigration \u8212\'20\'14 and, some say, a distraction from damaging news.\par \par \uc2 "You saw what happened to that beautiful, incredible young woman. Should have never happened. Illegally in our country," Trump said at a rally in West Virginia that night. "The immigration laws are such a disgrace. We're getting them changed."\par \par \uc2 White House press secretary \uc2 Sarah Huckabee Sanders\uc2  highlighted Tibbetts's death at the beginning of her press briefing on Aug. 21, before facing an avalanche of questions about the convictions of Trump personal attorney \uc2 Michael Cohen\uc2  and ex-campaign chairman \uc2 Paul Manafort\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "Sadly, the individual believed to be responsible for the murder is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 ," Sanders said, "making this an unfortunate reminder of why we need to strengthen our broken immigration laws."\par \par \uc2 On Friday, a day before Rob Tibbetts's guest column was published, Donald Trump Jr. used Mollie Tibbetts's name to rail against Democrats in the Des Moines Register.\par \par \uc2 "The reaction from some Democrats and others on the left to the murder of Mollie Tibbetts is as despicable as it is revealing," he began. "The mask is off and the true radical face of the Democrats has been exposed. They are seemingly more concerned with protecting their radical open-borders agenda than the lives of innocent Americans."\par \par \uc2 But Rob Tibbetts said his enduring memory of the nation's response to his daughter's disappearance and death is not one of division but of unity. The nation, he said, came together, pooling its knowledge, time and resources to help find his daughter.\par \par \uc2 "For most of the summer, the search for Mollie brought this nation together like no other pursuit," he said. "There was a common national will that did transcend opinion, race, gender and geography. Let's not lose sight of that miracle. Let's not lose sight of Mollie."\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020180902ee92003ux\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Federal law enforcement officials arrested the five people found with 11 children at a remote New Mexico compound in early August, charging them with violating federal firearm and conspiracy laws, they announced Friday.\par \par \uc2 The case involving the group, Siraj Ibn Wahhaj, 40; Jany Leveille, 35; Hujrah Wahhaj, 37; Subhannah Wahhaj, 35; and Lucas Morton, 40, has been subject to wide scrutiny after law enforcement officials raided the compound and said the group members were Muslim "extremists," and charged them with nearly a dozen counts each of child abuse. But multiple judges said that prosecutors had done little to prove the claims made in the case, and recently, two judges dismissed the child abuse charges against the group after state prosecutors missed a window for presenting evidence at preliminary hearing. Three of the defendants, Hujrah Wahhaj, Subhannah Wahhaj, and Lucas Morton, had been released from jail on Thursday.\par \par \uc2 One judge, Sarah Backus, said that there was no evidence presented in court that the guns seized from the group were illegally possessed. But federal officials said that Leveille, who is from Haiti, is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , and charged her with possession of a firearm and ammunition as it related to her lack of lawful residency. The other four defendants are charged with aiding, abetting and conspiring with her in the alleged offense. Leveille faces a potential sentence of as many as 10 years if convicted; the rest could face as many as 15 years in prison. All are being detained before a hearing Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 The arrests mark the latest twist in the case, which has drawn wide attention for its lurid details and allegations about connections to terrorism. It has also attracted conspiracy theories and a day of violent threats against a judge that were so severe that a New Mexico courthouse was put on lockdown for an afternoon.\par \par \uc2 Law enforcement officers said they found 11 guns on the squalid property in Amalia, near the state's border with Colorado, earlier this month. They also said they found ammunition, high-capacity magazines, a bulletproof vest, and 11 children between ages 1 and 15 in what police described as neglected condition. The body of Ibn Wahhaj's 3-year-old son, Abdul-Ghani, who suffered from severe health problems including seizures, was found on the property as well. Though the case was initially built by the Taos County Sheriff's Office and the district attorney who represents the area, federal authorities had been involved for some of that time, officials said after the raid. But the sheriff's office also said that federal authorities "didn't feel there was enough probable cause to get on the property," at the time.\par \par \uc2 At least five of the guns were transported in Leveille's car from Georgia or Alabama to New Mexico, the federal complaint against her says. According to an anonymous source cited in the complaint, Leveille had trained with a gun and fired it once at the compound, as well.\par \par \uc2 Elizabeth Martinez, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's office in New Mexico, said the defendants did not yet have attorneys in the federal case. Lawyers from the suspects' dismissed cases could not immediately be reached.\par \par \uc2 Tom Clark, a lawyer for Ibn Wahhaj, told Reuters that the charges were not a good development for the group.\par \par \uc2 "Anytime somebody gets in the crosshairs of the federal government it's problematic," he said. "It never goes well when you find yourself under federal indictment."\par \par \uc2 The complaint also included more allegations about the nature of the compound and the suspects' supposed intentions.\par \par \uc2 According to an anonymous witness cited in the federal complaint, Leveille wanted to take a child to the property to perform an exorcism on him to cast the demons from his body. After he was resurrected, the boy would instruct them what corrupt institutions they needed to get rid of, which the witness said included teachers, military, law enforcement and financial institutions, the complaint said. That witness, as well as one more who was also not named, said that they believed that meant killing or imprisoning people who did not believe as they did, the complaint alleges.\par \par \uc2 The first witness also told investigators that Ibn Wahhaj wanted to get an army together and train them for "jihad," which the witness believed meant to kill people in the name of Allah. That witness and Ibn Wahhaj were both engaged in weapons training at the compound, the complaint alleges.\par \par \uc2 Leveille was the leader at the compound, who ordered the group to surrender when they were confronted by law enforcement authorities during the raid, according to the complaint. She entered the country in New York on a tourist visa that allowed for a six-month stay in 1998 but had never obtained lawful residency, the complaint says.\par \par \uc2 Read more:\par \par \uc2 Judge's move to grant bail in New Mexico compound case draws a \uc2 Twitter\uc2  mob \u8212\'20\'14 and death threats\par \par \uc2 Former 'ER' actress Vanessa Marquez fatally shot by police doing wellness check\par \par \uc2 Her daughter was killed in the Parkland shooting.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 \u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 About US is an initiative by The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2  to cover issues of identity in the United States. Sign up for the newsletter.\par \par \uc2 "Go back to where you came from," screamed a door-to-door salesman, slamming the door on me and my mother after we told him we didn't want to buy his cleaning products.\par \par \uc2 It was decades ago, when I was in elementary school and the number of immigrant families in my neighborhood was increasing. But what I couldn't reconcile was that I was already where I came from \u8212\'20\'14 Northern California. This country was the only place I had ever lived.\par \par \uc2 Mandarin was my first language, because that's what my parents spoke at home, so I had to suffer through English as a Second Language classes instead of enjoying recess. I attended Chinese class every weekend, as much for cultural enrichment as language skills, missing Saturday morning cartoons.\par \par \uc2 Since I lived in the Bay Area, all of my friends were Asian. We snacked on dumplings, Pocky and boba, made fun of our parents' accents and drove souped-up Hondas. The cool kids in my high school scored perfect SATs and played badminton, not football.\par \par \uc2 So I thought I was very Chinese \u8212\'20\'14 until I decided to move to Hong Kong.\par \par \uc2 Some young Chinese Americans during the U.S. recession decided to immigrate to China, where the economy was booming. The motherland offered opportunities that some of us struggled to find in the United States, including stable, well-paying jobs and a society where our appearance wasn't labeled "other."\par \par \uc2 "China, and Asia in general, was on the rise economically," said \uc2 Peter Yu\uc2 , 49, who grew up in San Jose and moved to Hong Kong in 2008.\par \par \uc2 "The opportunities, dynamism and personal heritage connection there appealed to my constant urge to explore, learn, and grow both professionally and personally," Yu said in an email. On top of that, "I wanted to work in Greater China so I could get my ROI from all of those lost Saturday mornings."\par \par \uc2 Ironically, our parents had made the opposite journey in search of economic security. Many objected to our return, worried that we were no longer Chinese enough.\par \par \uc2 But for some, there was an additional draw. As a 2013 China Daily story put it, some immigrants arriving from the United States and other Western countries were in search of "a sense of belonging."\par \par \uc2 I left last year to pursue a romantic tale of working as a foreign correspondent. I was finally going "home."\par \par \uc2 But when I arrived in Hong Kong, I discovered that I didn't fit in there, either.\par \par \uc2 Life was hard. I stuck out. I was yelled at for not understanding the local dialect and glared at for my blue hair. I learned to cope by paying with bigger bills when I couldn't understand the price, and pointed to other people's meals when I couldn't read the menu. I stayed in the more expatriate neighborhoods of Hong Kong or made sure I shopped and ate with a local when I ventured out. Sometimes, it was just easier to stay in.\par \par \uc2 I spoke conversational Mandarin, not the Hong Kong dialect of Cantonese. When restaurants got my order wrong, the workers took their frustrations out on me, shouting about how slow I was ordering buns. Since I spoke China's main dialect, I represented their enemy. I had to go out of my way to explain that I'm American and my parents are from Taiwan \u8212\'20\'14 either that or never buy buns there again.\par \par \uc2 "You're always a foreigner if you are not born or raised there, legally and conceptually," said Jason Chang, who, after working as a contract attorney for a few years in the District of Columbia, moved to Shanghai at age 31 for a "bare-bones Chinese salary" at a local law firm. It was the only viable option when the financial crisis hit after he graduated from law school in 2008.\par \par \uc2 Chang's bet paid off when he was hired at an international law firm in his second year in China. He now splits his time between San Francisco and Shanghai.\par \par \uc2 Chang attended Chinese school while growing up and majored in Asian studies at the \uc2 University of California at Berkeley\uc2 , but he struggled with basic tasks in Shanghai, such as using the washing machine, whose instructions were in Chinese.\par \par \uc2 For me, it wasn't just the language gap. I also had trouble fitting in because I wasn't familiar with certain customs, such as the practice of saying less to mean more in some settings.\par \par \uc2 Business communication in Asia can be implied and indirect, said Tim Tu, who has done business in China since 2002. He moved to Hong Kong from Los Angeles in 2009, then to Shenzhen, China, to start the study-tour company Mind Over Mandarin.\par \par \uc2 "Sometimes things are better left unsaid but understood," he said. "In America, unclear communication is frowned upon."\par \par \uc2 After years of working in the United States, I had been conditioned to speak up. So while I may be a quiet American, I am a very loud and direct Chinese American. When people stared, I glared right back. Then I changed my hair from bright blue to bright green.\par \par \uc2 My parents left everything behind to come to America and now have lived in the United States longer than in their homelands. My father started as a busboy, walking to work in his only pair of shoes. He climbed the ranks, attending graduate school at Texas A&M and becoming an executive in a technology company. My mother studied biochemistry at the \uc2 University of Tennessee\uc2 . But they were alone in this country, so while my dad worked, my mom stayed home to take care of me and my brother.\par \par \uc2 Now, when my parents visit their former home, they stick out, too. My dad proudly wears a baseball cap from his alma mater. For a long time, he also wore cowboy boots like any proud Texan.\par \par \uc2 In Hong Kong, my parents get ripped off like any other tourists. As Mandarin speakers, they are yelled at, too. One time, after they were chastised in Cantonese for not understanding the price difference between eating in and taking out, they retreated to \uc2 McDonald's\uc2 . When I returned home from work, I found them holed up in my tiny apartment, traumatized and refusing to venture out again.\par \par \uc2 There is a scene in "Crazy Rich Asians" in which the main character wonders: If we are all Chinese, why can't we get along? Her mother points to the daughter's head and heart, explaining that those parts are American.\par \par \uc2 When I asked my own mom that question, she laughed and said I was not very Chinese at all.\par \par \uc2 Our sense of beauty is different, too. Many women in Asia aim to be as pale as possible, this being perceived to be a sign of status and wealth. When my tan Floridian fiance, a Hong Konger by birth, came to visit, the cops stopped him. They assumed he was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  due to his dark skin color.\par \par \uc2 Then, there comes the question of loyalty. I flew to Hong Kong on Inauguration Day last year, and as the only American in the room, I was often questioned about U.S. policies.\par \par \uc2 My friend Kelly, who moved from Seattle to Shanghai and Taiwan in 2011 to work for two international companies, received similar questions.\par \par \uc2 "If the U.S.-China trade war breaks out, which side do you stand on?" said Kelly, who refrained from giving her last name to avoid jeopardizing her job. "If the answer is more American-sided, I would sometimes receive appalled looks and a subsequent lecture on patriotism. \u8230\'20\'26 However, on the lighter occasions, I am expected to be American amongst the Chinese, conveniently when someone needs to dance like Beyonc\u233\'00\'E9 and rap Nicki Minaj at annual dinners."\par \par \uc2 Like New York City, Hong Kong and Shanghai seduce young people with the thrills, risks and rewards of the big city, with the added opportunity for young Asian Americans of exploring their roots.\par \par \uc2 Hong Kong offered a home with people who looked like me and a bustling landscape that was always challenging me to learn more, but my mind and heart belonged elsewhere.\par \par \uc2 My time there expanded my worldview and taught me that the United States is not the center of the universe. I learned to assert myself, so I was no longer afraid of ordering buns. And I gained a new appreciation for my parents' journey as immigrants, how they braved a new world without \uc2 Google\uc2  Translate. They didn't even have the luxury of looking like locals.\par \par \uc2 But my year and a half in Hong Kong made clear that while the United States is not a perfect fit, it's the best fit for me.\par \par \uc2 Correction: An earlier version of this post misspelled\u160\'00\'A0Marian Liu's name in a photo credit. A previous version of this story also incorrectly indicated that \uc2 Peter Yu\uc2  was on the verge of losing his job when he moved to Hong Kong in 2008.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020180831ee8v0012x\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 BROOKLYN, Iowa \u8212\'20\'14 Far from the courtrooms where President Trump was battered this week by bad news, a slaying in small-town Iowa has given him ammunition to defend some of his most raw statements about illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 A college student was found dead.\par \par \uc2 A 24-year-old Mexican national is charged with murder.\par \par \uc2 The slaying of Mollie Tibbetts and the arrest this week of farmworker Cristhian Rivera pulled attention away from the convictions of the president's former campaign chairman and personal attorney while providing an example of the kind of criminal fears that fueled Trump's rise to the White House.\par \par \uc2 Investigators have not said how Tibbetts was killed or what happened in the moments after she disappeared July 18 while jogging. But after confessing to her killing Monday, Rivera led police this week to her body in a field.\par \par \uc2 Tibbetts, 20, was a psychology student at the \uc2 University of Iowa\uc2 , and her disappearance sparked a month-long search.\par \par \uc2 [Tibbetts relative tells 'despicable' partisans not to politicize her distant cousin's death]\par \par \uc2 Administration officials and Republican lawmakers have seized upon the case to rally support ahead of the November midterms while warning that a loss of congressional majorities would expose the president to possible impeachment. Trump has told supporters that Democrats represent "open borders" that would invite a flood of dangerous illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 The loss of Mollie Tibbetts is a devastating reminder that we must urgently fix our broken immigration laws. pic.twitter.com/0Kaz0FQw36\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 The White House (@WhiteHouse) August 22, 2018\par \par \uc2 White House press secretary \uc2 Sarah Huckabee Sanders\uc2  highlighted Tibbetts's death at the beginning of her press briefing Wednesday before facing questions about the convictions of Trump personal attorney \uc2 Michael Cohen\uc2  and ex-campaign chairman \uc2 Paul Manafort\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "Sadly, the individual believed to be responsible for the murder is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 ," Sanders said, "making this an unfortunate reminder of why we need to strengthen our broken immigration laws."\par \par \uc2 While media coverage of the Manafort and Cohen cases dominated mainstream news outlets, Trump allies sought to refocus attention on Tibbetts's death and the suspect's immigration status.\par \par \uc2 Fox News led its website with a package on the case headlined, "Monster Down the Road," and Vice President Pence and former Trump campaign aide \uc2 Corey Lewandowski\uc2  drew attention to her death on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 . "We MUST stop illegals from coming to our country and killing innocent people \u8212\'20\'14 this is non negotiable," Lewandowski wrote.\par \par \uc2 Republican pollster Chris Wilson, who is working on several battleground Senate races, said he expects more GOP candidates to hammer at the Tibbetts case.\par \par \uc2 "It gets to the basic point Republicans have been making" that the immigration system needs to get stricter, Wilson said. "Immigration as an issue is a winner for Republicans when we make it about security and crime."\par \par \uc2 Immigrants do not commit violent crimes at a higher rate than native-born Americans, according to federal and state crime statistics. A study published in February by the libertarian \uc2 Cato Institute\uc2  examining 2015 criminal data in Texas found native-born residents were much more likely to be convicted of a crime than immigrants in the country legally or illegally.\par \par \uc2 Investigators have not found anything indicating that Tibbetts and Rivera knew one another before the attack, Mitch Mortvedt, assistant director of Iowa's Division of Criminal Investigation, said in an interview Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 The area where Tibbetts went running is a narrow farm road leading out of town, Mortvedt said, and investigators are looking at whether her killer noticed her by chance or had seen her there on previous occasions. "It's not like a jogging path with benches or picnic tables. It's a city street that turns into county road, with corn fields on both sides," he said. "She was just running on the side of the road."\par \par \uc2 Rivera was taken into custody after agreeing to an interview with investigators, according to Mortvedt, who said state officials have been assisted by the \uc2 FBI\uc2  and \uc2 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2 's Homeland Security Investigations division. Rivera is charged with first-degree murder, and a judge Wednesday set his bail at $5 million.\par \par \uc2 Rivera was in the country illegally and used a stolen identification to satisfy a federal background check at the farm where he worked, according to law enforcement officials and statements Wednesday by his former employer.\par \par \uc2 During a news conference Wednesday, Yarrabee Farms manager Dane Lang said Rivera provided a state-issued photo identification and a Social Security card when he applied for a job nearly four years ago.\par \par \uc2 But those documents were false, Lang said.\par \par \uc2 He said Yarrabee Farms did not use the government's E-Verify system to vet Rivera. Instead, the farm used a program connected to a \uc2 Social Security Administration\uc2  database, which didn't flag any problems.\par \par \uc2 Lang would not disclose the name that Rivera used to get a job.\par \par \uc2 "He came to work every day, was on time and got along with his co-workers," Lang said. "All of us are saddened by the tragic death of Mollie and the realization that one of our co-workers was involved.\par \par \uc2 "This is tragic. Mollie's death is tragic. Everyone in our community wishes this didn't happen. I believe we complied. I know we complied with the full extent of the law when we filled out the I-9," he added, referring to federal employment paperwork.\par \par \uc2 He said employees didn't notice a difference in Rivera's behavior after Tibbetts went missing.\par \par \uc2 "This guy stayed around for 35 days after he did this," he said. "Nobody noticed a difference."\par \par \uc2 In a motion asking for a gag order, Rivera's attorney, Allan M. Richards, claimed Wednesday that Rivera was in the country legally, saying that his employer had verified Rivera's status. Richards provided no evidence to back up his assertion in the motion and could not immediately be reached for comment.\par \par \uc2 In statements to investigators, Rivera said he spotted Tibbetts jogging and drove past her several times. The Chevrolet Malibu he was driving appeared in and out of surveillance footage from a camera aimed at the street.\par \par \uc2 "It seemed that he followed her and seemed to be drawn to her on that particular day," Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation Agent Rick Rahn told reporters. "And for whatever reason, he chose to abduct her."\par \par \uc2 What happened next, Rivera told authorities, is blocked from his memory, something he said happens when he gets upset or angry. The next thing he recalled, he told investigators, was being inside the car and finding a headphone earpiece in his lap that did not belong to him. That prompted him to open the trunk, where he saw Tibbetts bleeding from the head.\par \par \uc2 Rivera told authorities he carried Tibbetts's body into an isolated cornfield, where he covered her with stalks and walked away.\par \par \uc2 A \uc2 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2  representative said that the agency lodged an immigration detainer on Rivera after his arrest, so if he is ever released, he would be deported to Mexico.\par \par \uc2 Within hours of the news conference announcing Rivera's arrest, President Trump weighed in on the killing.\par \par \uc2 "You saw what happened to that incredible, beautiful woman [Mollie Tibbetts]," he said at a rally in West Virginia. "Should have never happened. . . . The immigration laws are such a disgrace. We're getting them changed."\par \par \uc2 As lawmakers publicly debated what Tibbetts's death said about the nation's immigration system, her family, which had been vocal during the search for the college student, released a statement asking to be "allowed the time to process our devastating loss and share our grief in private."\par \par \uc2 "Please remember, Evil comes in EVERY color," Tibbetts's aunt Billie Jo Calderwood said in a statement.\par \par \uc2 Alice Crites, Julie Tate, Philip Bump, Christopher Ingraham, Tracy Jan, Michael E. Miller, David Nakamura and Eli Rosenberg contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 This story has been updated.\par \par \uc2 \u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Read more:\par \par \uc2 A family has searched for a missing woman for months.

Wootson Jr.                Nick Miroff \par \uc2 1,302 \uc2 words\par \uc2 23 August 2018\par \uc2 The Washington Post\par \uc2 WP\par \uc2 FINAL\par A01\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2018, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved \par \par \uc2 BROOKLYN, Iowa - Far from the courtrooms where President Trump was battered this week by bad news, a slaying in small-town Iowa has given him ammunition to defend some of his most raw statements about illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 A college student was found dead. A 24-year-old Mexican national is charged with murder.\par \par \uc2 The slaying of Mollie Tibbetts and the arrest of this week of farmworker Cristhian Rivera pulled attention away from the convictions of the president's former campaign chairman and personal attorney while providing an example of the kind of criminal fears that fueled Trump's rise to the White House.\par \par \uc2 Investigators have not said how Tibbetts was killed or what happened in the moments after she disappeared July 18 while jogging. But after confessing to her killing Monday, Rivera led police this week to her body in a field.\par \par \uc2 Tibbetts, 20, was a psychology student at the \uc2 University of Iowa\uc2 , and her disappearance sparked a month-long search.\par \par \uc2 Administration officials and Republican lawmakers have seized upon the case to rally support ahead of the November midterms while warning that a loss of congressional majorities would expose the president to possible impeachment. Trump has told supporters that Democrats represent "open borders" that would invite a flood of dangerous illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 White House press secretary \uc2 Sarah Huckabee Sanders\uc2  highlighted Tibbetts's death at the beginning of her press briefing Wednesday before facing questions about the convictions of Trump personal attorney \uc2 Michael Cohen\uc2  and ex-campaign chairman \uc2 Paul Manafort\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "Sadly, the individual believed to be responsible for the murder is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 ," Sanders said, "making this an unfortunate reminder of why we need to strengthen our broken immigration laws."\par \par \uc2 While media coverage of the Manafort and Cohen cases dominated mainstream news outlets, Trump allies sought to refocus attention on Tibbetts's death and the suspect's immigration status.\par \par \uc2 Fox News led its website with a package on the case headlined, "Monster Down the Road," and Vice President Pence and former Trump campaign aide \uc2 Corey Lewandowski\uc2  drew attention to her death on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 . "We MUST stop illegals from coming to our country and killing innocent people - this is non negotiable," Lewandowski wrote.\par \par \uc2 Republican pollster Chris Wilson, who is working on several battleground Senate races, said he expects more GOP candidates to hammer at the Tibbetts case.\par \par \uc2 "It gets to the basic point Republicans have been making" that the immigration system needs to get stricter, Wilson said. "Immigration as an issue is a winner for Republicans when we make it about security and crime."\par \par \uc2 Immigrants do not commit violent crimes at a higher rate than native-born Americans, according to federal and state crime statistics. A study published in February by the libertarian \uc2 Cato Institute\uc2  examining 2015 criminal data in Texas found native-born residents were much more likely to be convicted of a crime than immigrants in the country legally or illegally.\par \par \uc2 Investigators have not found anything indicating that Tibbetts and Rivera knew one another before the attack, Mitch Mortvedt, assistant director of Iowa's Division of Criminal Investigation, said in an interview Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 The area where Tibbetts went running is a narrow farm road leading out of town, Mortvedt said, and investigators are looking at whether her killer noticed her by chance or had seen her there on previous occasions. "It's not like a jogging path with benches or picnic tables. It's a city street that turns into county road, with corn fields on both sides," he said. "She was just running on the side of the road."\par \par \uc2 Rivera was taken into custody after agreeing to an interview with investigators, according to Mortvedt, who said state officials have been assisted by the \uc2 FBI\uc2  and \uc2 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2 's Homeland Security Investigations division. Rivera is charged with first-degree murder, and a judge Wednesday set his bail at $5 million.\par \par \uc2 Rivera was in the country illegally and used a stolen identification to satisfy a federal background check at the farm where he worked, according to law enforcement officials and statements Wednesday by his former employer.\par \par \uc2 During a news conference Wednesday, Yarrabee Farms manager Dane Lang said Rivera provided a state-issued photo identification and a Social Security card when he applied for a job nearly four years ago.\par \par \uc2 But those documents were false, Lang said.\par \par \uc2 He said Yarrabee Farms did not use the government's E-Verify system to vet Rivera. Instead, the farm used a program connected to a \uc2 Social Security Administration\uc2  database, which didn't flag any problems.\par \par \uc2 Lang would not disclose the name that Rivera used to get a job.\par \par \uc2 "He came to work every day, was on time and got along with his co-workers," Lang said. "All of us are saddened by the tragic death of Mollie and the realization that one of our co-workers was involved.\par \par \uc2 "This is tragic. Mollie's death is tragic. Everyone in our community wishes this didn't happen. I believe we complied. I know we complied with the full extent of the law when we filled out the I-9," he added, referring to federal employment paperwork.\par \par \uc2 He said employees didn't notice a difference in Rivera's behavior after Tibbetts went missing.\par \par \uc2 "This guy stayed around for 35 days after he did this," he said. "Nobody noticed a difference."\par \par \uc2 In a motion asking for a gag order, Rivera's attorney, Allan M. Richards, claimed Wednesday that Rivera was in the country legally, saying that his employer had verified Rivera's status. Richards provided no evidence to back up his assertion in the motion and could not immediately be reached for comment.\par \par \uc2 In statements to investigators, Rivera said he spotted Tibbetts jogging and drove past her several times. The Chevrolet Malibu he was driving appeared in and out of surveillance footage from a camera aimed at the street.\par \par \uc2 "It seemed that he followed her and seemed to be drawn to her on that particular day," Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation Agent Rick Rahn told reporters. "And for whatever reason, he chose to abduct her."\par \par \uc2 What happened next, Rivera told authorities, is blocked from his memory, something he said happens when he gets upset or angry. The next thing he recalled, he told investigators, was being in the car and finding a headphone earpiece in his lap that did not belong to him. That prompted him to open the trunk, where he saw Tibbetts bleeding from the head.\par \par \uc2 Rivera told authorities he carried Tibbetts's body into an isolated cornfield, where he covered her with stalks and walked away.\par \par \uc2 A \uc2 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2  representative said that the agency lodged an immigration detainer on Rivera after his arrest, so if he is ever released, he would be deported to Mexico.\par \par \uc2 Within hours of the news conference announcing Rivera's arrest, President Trump weighed in on the killing.\par \par \uc2 "You saw what happened to that incredible, beautiful woman [Mollie Tibbetts]," he said at a rally in West Virginia. "Should have never happened. . . . The immigration laws are such a disgrace. We're getting them changed."\par \par \uc2 As lawmakers publicly debated what Tibbetts's death said about the nation's immigration system, her family, which had been vocal during the search for the college student, released a statement asking to be "allowed the time to process our devastating loss and share our grief in private."\par \par \uc2 "Please remember, Evil comes in EVERY color," Tibbetts's aunt Billie Jo Calderwood said in a statement.\par \par \uc2 katie.mettler@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 cleve.wootson@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 nick.miroff@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 Philip Bump, Christopher Ingraham, Tracy Jan, Michael E.

Wootson Jr. \par \uc2 1,149 \uc2 words\par \uc2 22 August 2018\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2018, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Law enforcement officials in Iowa charged a man on Tuesday with murdering 20-year-old college student Mollie Tibbetts, saying he admitted to pursuing her as she ran on a country road and eventually led them to the field where a body they believe to be hers was hidden under cornstalks.\par \par \uc2 The suspect was identified as 24-year-old Cristhian Bahena Rivera, who authorities said was an undocumented immigrant from Mexico. Rivera worked at a local farm for the past four years, according to the Associated Press.\u160\'00\'A0Authorities also spelled Rivera's first name as Christian.\par \par \uc2 He was charged with first-degree murder, with a potential penalty of life in prison, according to Rick Rahn,\u160\'00\'A0a special agent in charge for the sector at the Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation.\par \par \uc2 Tibbetts, who was studying psychology the \uc2 University of Iowa\uc2 , had been missing since leaving for a run last month from her boyfriend's house in Brooklyn, Iowa, a small town of about 1,500.\par \par \uc2 The case unraveled in dramatic fashion on Tuesday as reports emerged in the morning that authorities had found Tibbetts's body, followed by an afternoon announcement that Rivera\u160\'00\'A0had been arrested and charged.\par \par \uc2 Rahn declined to give many details about Tibbetts's killing, citing the ongoing investigation and saying that her body had yet to be formally identified. He said that Rivera told investigators that he saw her running, approached her, and ran alongside or behind her, even relaying to authorities that Tibbetts had grabbed her phone and threatened to call the police. He continued to pursue her and then abducted her, Rahn said.\par \par \uc2 Our thoughts continue to be with Mollie Tibbetts' family and friends. Mollie went missing from her hometown of Brooklyn, Iowa last week. Please contact authorities if you have any information: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://t.co/TZWzvXYA2l"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://t.co/TZWzvXYA2l}}}\uc2  pic.twitter.com/L4Fm5QQbAg\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 \uc2 University of Iowa\uc2  (@uiowa) July 25, 2018\par \par \uc2 For more than a month after Tibbetts disappeared on July 18, federal, state and local authorities scoured the rural county, sifting through electronic data from her \uc2 Fitbit\uc2 , cellphone and social media accounts for any clue about what happened to her.\par \par \uc2 Rahn said that investigators had talked to hundreds of people and received more than 4,000 tips, but the break in the case came within the last two weeks when they found someone with a security camera system while canvassing a neighborhood.\par \par \uc2 The cameras captured images of Tibbetts running, as well as a black Chevy Malibu that investigators said they traced to Rivera, informing a determination that Rivera was one of the last people to see her running, Rahn said. They conducted a lengthy interview with Rivera on Monday after approaching him for the first time, in which he told them about seeing her running and how he pursued her.\par \par \uc2 "He was very compliant," Rahn said. "He was willing to talk to us. There was no fight or struggle of any kind."\par \par \uc2 But the account Rivera gave investigators has some significant gaps in it, according to an affidavit filed in district court. Rivera told them that he panicked after Tibbetts said she was going to call the police and "blocked" his "memory," the affidavit said. His memory picks up again at an intersection where he noticed a headphone earpiece in his lap and realized he had put Tibbetts in his trunk, where he found her with blood on her head, it said. He then dragged her into a secluded place in a cornfield, where he left her face up and covered her with corn stalks.\par \par \uc2 Prayers for Tibbetts family & all who knew & loved Mollie. Lots of questions\u8212\'20\'14where did this illegal alien work? what was his work status\u8212\'20\'14but one thing is sure: Mollie would be alive if our government had taken immigration enforcement seriously years ago. {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://t.co/JScrv7aD5P"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://t.co/JScrv7aD5P}}}\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 Tom Cotton (@TomCottonAR) August 21, 2018\par \par \uc2 Rahn said Rivera led officials to her body after they were done interviewing him.\u160\'00\'A0He also said that officials believed that Rivera was employed but declined to specify how or with whom.\par \par \uc2 The results of an autopsy are pending, and Rahn did not specify a cause of death. Rivera is being held at the Poweshiek County jail in lieu of a $1 million cash bond.\par \par \uc2 A representative for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said the agency lodged an immigration detainer on Rivera with local authorities after his arrest on Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 Rivera worked at Yarrabee Farms in Brooklyn, Iowa, the farm's president Eric Lang told the AP. He was in good standing, according to Lang, and had passed the government's E-Verify system.\u160\'00\'A0Lang is the brother of Craig Lang, a "prominent Iowa farmer and GOP official" who recently lost the 2018 Republican primary to become Iowa's agriculture secretary.\par \par \uc2 The case seems certain to add fuel to the already explosive and racially tinged debate about immigration, as President Trump's border wall, which he touts as a symbol of security, remains an unfulfilled and unfunded campaign promise.\par \par \uc2 At a rally in West Virginia on Tuesday night, Trump referred to the killing and the arrest of the "illegal alien" from Mexico.\par \par \uc2 "You saw what happened to that beautiful, incredible young woman. Should have never happened. Illegally in our country," he said. "The immigration laws are such a disgrace. We're getting them changed."\par \par \uc2 "Heartbroken by the news about Mollie Tibbetts,"\u160\'00\'A0Vice President Pence wrote on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 .\u160\'00\'A0"We commend the swift action by local, state, & federal investigators working in Iowa in apprehending an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , who's now charged with first-degree murder."\par \par \uc2 The broad contours of Tibbetts's death are reminiscent of the case of \uc2 Kate Steinle\uc2 , a 32-year-old white woman whose 2015 death, after she\u160\'00\'A0was struck by a bullet in a popular area of San Francisco, has become a\u160\'00\'A0cri de coeur for Trump and other conservatives and proponents of harsher immigration laws. An\u160\'00\'A0undocumented immigrant,\u160\'00\'A0\uc2 Jose Ines Garcia Zarate\uc2 , was later convicted on a gun charge related to Steinle's death. Zarate had already been deported from the United States five times.\par \par \uc2 Tibbetts was born in San Francisco and moved to the Iowa town with her mother when she was in second grade. She won state speech competitions, was involved in theater and ran cross-country.\par \par \uc2 Christopher Ingraham and Philip Bump contributed to this report.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Read more:\par \par \uc2 A family has searched for a missing woman for months.

Wootson Jr. \par \uc2 637 \uc2 words\par \uc2 22 August 2018\par \uc2 The Washington Post\par \uc2 WP\par \uc2 FINAL\par A02\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2018, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved \par \par \uc2 Law enforcement officials in Iowa have charged a man with murdering 20-year-old college student Mollie Tibbetts, saying he admitted to pursuing her as she ran on a country road and eventually led them to the field where her body was buried under corn stalks.\par \par \uc2 The suspect was identified as 24-year-old Christian Bahena-Rivera, who authorities said was an undocumented immigrant from Mexico who had been living in the United States for at least four years. Bahena-Rivera was charged with first-degree murder, with a potential penalty of life in prison, according to Rick Rahn, a special agent in charge for the sector at the Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation.\par \par \uc2 Tibbetts, who was studying psychology at the \uc2 University of Iowa\uc2 , had been missing since leaving for a run last month from her boyfriend's house in Brooklyn, Iowa, a small town of about 1,500.\par \par \uc2 The case unraveled in dramatic fashion on Tuesday as reports emerged in the morning that authorities had found Tibbetts's body, followed by an afternoon announcement that Bahena-Rivera had been arrested and charged.\par \par \uc2 Rahn declined to give many details about Tibbetts's killing, citing the ongoing investigation. He said that Bahena-Rivera told investigators that he saw her running, approached her, and ran alongside or behind her, even relaying to authorities that Tibbetts had grabbed her phone and threatened to call the police. He continued to pursue her and then abducted her, Rahn said.\par \par \uc2 The case is certain to add fuel to the explosive and racially tinged debate about immigration, as President Trump's border wall, which he touts as a symbol of security, remains an unfulfilled and unfunded campaign promise.\par \par \uc2 At a rally in West Virginia on Tuesday night, Trump referred to the Tibbetts case and the arrest of the "illegal alien" from Mexico.\par \par \uc2 "You saw what happened to that beautiful, incredible young woman. Should have never happened. Illegally in our country," he said. "The immigration laws are such a disgrace. We're getting them changed."\par \par \uc2 "Heartbroken by the news about Mollie Tibbetts," Vice President Pence wrote on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 . "We commend the swift action by local, state, & federal investigators working in Iowa in apprehending an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , who's now charged with first-degree murder."\par \par \uc2 The broad contours of Tibbetts's death are reminiscent of the case of \uc2 Kate Steinle\uc2 , a 32-year-old white woman whose 2015 death, after she was shot in a popular area of San Francisco, has become a point of outcry for Trump and other conservatives and proponents of harsher immigration laws. An undocumented immigrant, \uc2 Jose Ines Garcia Zarate\uc2 , was later convicted on gun charges related to Steinle's death.\par \par \uc2 Tibbetts disappeared on July 18 after she had gone out to jog. For more than a month, federal, state and local authorities had scoured the rural county, sifting through electronic data from her \uc2 Fitbit\uc2 , cellphone and social media accounts for clues.\par \par \uc2 Rahn said the break in the case came within the last two weeks when they found someone with a security camera system while canvassing a neighborhood.\par \par \uc2 The videos had captured images of Tibbetts running as well as a black Chevy Malibu that investigators said they traced to Bahena-Rivera, Rahn said. They conducted a lengthy interview with Bahena-Rivera on Monday.\par \par \uc2 The results of an autopsy are still pending, and Rahn did not specify a cause of death. Bahena-Rivera is being held at the Poweshiek County jail, he said.\par \par \uc2 A representative for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said that the agency lodged an immigration detainer on Bahena-Rivera with local authorities after his arrest on Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 eli.rosenberg@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 nick.miroff@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 cleve.wootson@washpost.com \par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com\par \par \uc2 WP20180822tibbetts0822\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020180822ee8m00023\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 So far this summer, members of the Trump administration have been cursed at while picking up takeout, heckled by protesters while eating dinner,\u160\'00\'A0confronted in cafes by strangers demanding they resign\u160\'00\'A0and, in the case of \uc2 Sarah Huckabee Sanders\uc2 , even asked to leave a restaurant in the middle of a meal. Inevitably, these confrontations lead to endless discussions about civility and whether public officials have the right to eat in peace.\par \par \uc2 This weekend, however, the reverse happened in Houston. A popular Tex-Mex restaurant served dinner to Attorney General Jeff Sessions, calling it an "honor" on \uc2 Facebook\uc2 . In response, left-leaning Houstonians called for a boycott, and the restaurant received so much criticism on social media that it deleted all its accounts.\par \par \uc2 Sessions had traveled to Houston on Friday to discuss his plans to\u160\'00\'A0cut down on violent crime, according to the Houston Chronicle. During his speech, he called for a crackdown on illegal immigration and a ban on sanctuary cities.\par \par \uc2 "This should be obvious: If we want to reduce violent crime, we should reduce \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  crime," he said.\par \par \uc2 That same night, El Tiempo Cantina posted a picture of Sessions with co-owner Dominic Laurenzo on the restaurant's \uc2 Facebook\uc2  page.\par \par \uc2 "We had the honor to [serve] Mr. Jeff Sessions, Attorney General of the United States," the caption said. "Thank you for allowing us to serve you."\par \par \uc2 The post got an immediate response on social media, and quickly spawned the hashtag #BoycottElTiempo.\par \par \uc2 El Tiempo in Houston is CANCELED.\par \par \uc2 ALL OF THEM. pic.twitter.com/RbTsX0TFa0\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 Scamlett Johansson (@berryisai) August 10, 2018\par \par \uc2 Jeff Sessions continues to target immigrants and enable Trump's discriminatory policies yet @ElTiempoCantina is "Honored to serve him".\par \par \uc2 Feel free to share your thoughts on El Tiempo's \uc2 Facebook\uc2  page: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://t.co/ku6VY3qIBV"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://t.co/ku6VY3qIBV}}}\uc2  #BoycottElTiempo\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 Antonio (@AntonioArellano) August 11, 2018\par \par \uc2 When you're job is to serve, keeping it professional at all times is perfectly fine @ElTiempoCantina.

Cullen III (@aubreypcul) August 12, 2018\par \par \uc2 On Saturday, Roland Laurenzo, Dominic's father and the restaurant's co-owner, disavowed the administration's immigration policies in a \uc2 Facebook\uc2  post:\par \par \uc2 El Tiempo does not in anyway support the practice of separating children from parents or any other practices of the government relative to immigration. The posting of a photograph of the Attorney General at one of our restaurants does not represent us supporting his positions. The secret service contacted us that a government official was coming to dinner at our establishment and his identity was not know until he walked through the door. The man came to dinner and he was served without us even thinking about the political situations. We were preoccupied with the secret service and catering to their wants and needs. The only thing on our minds was serving great food and giving great customer service. It was posted without review or approval by ownership and this has lead to everyone jumping to conclusions that somehow we are involved in this political matter. We don't approve of anyone separating parents and children.\par \par \uc2 Neither of the Laurenzos could be reached for comment late Sunday. But in an interview\u160\'00\'A0with\u160\'00\'A0KHOU11 on Saturday, Roland Laurenzo said that the company's social media manager \u8212\'20\'14 whom he didn't name and who couldn't be identified through an online search \u8212\'20\'14 had written the post that thanked Sessions.\par \par \uc2 "In retrospect, it was a mistake because it angered so many people," he told the station. "We have gotten so many complaints and comments. And threats, death threats. This has been extremely shocking to our family."\par \par \uc2 The company doesn't agree with Sessions's views on\u160\'00\'A0gay rights\u160\'00\'A0or\u160\'00\'A0family separation, Laurenzo said, adding that his son, Dominic, had discussed fajitas with the attorney general.\par \par \uc2 Security is making themselves known outside El Tiempo on Navigation after the Mexican restaurant's post has sparked controversy. The business hosted AG Sessions while he was in Houston.

On Saturday afternoon, the restaurant shut down all its \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , \uc2 Instagram\uc2  and \uc2 Facebook\uc2  pages, the Houston Chronicle reported. Early Monday, those accounts were still offline.\par \par \uc2 "People are insulting us in such a dramatic fashion, and we feel like we don't deserve it," Roland Laurenzo told ABC13 on Sunday. "At least temporarily I had it taken down because I don't want to be insulted, my children to be insulted, my family to be insulted."\par \par \uc2 He also expressed regret over the post thanking Sessions, calling it "inaccurate in terms of the totality of what we would be thinking."\par \par \uc2 That prompted even more ire \u8212\'20\'14 this time from Trump supporters.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://t.co/DnJOZOylZN"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://t.co/DnJOZOylZN}}}\uc2 \u8211\'20\'13 in my opinion no apology needed \u8211\'20\'13 El Tiempo should have been honored to take a photo with Jeff Sessions.

U r in business to serve food not profile ur customers.Do u serve adulterers, liars, tax evaders, abusers, ex convicts, racists? Stick to serving food don't profile. {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://t.co/CiE8jALUGG"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://t.co/CiE8jALUGG}}}\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 TruthBTold (@TruthBToldn) August 11, 2018\par \par \uc2 According to the restaurant's website, Roland and Dominic Laurenzo opened El Tiempo Cantina in 1998. Roland's mother, Ninfa Laurenzo, had previously owned a popular Tex-Mex restaurant where she "blended traditional Mexican family recipes with Italian traditions from her husband's side," but it\u160\'00\'A0went bankrupt in the late 1990s. The chain currently has eight locations in the Houston area. In 2017, the Houston Press named it the best Tex-Mex restaurant in the city.\par \par \uc2 El Tiempo's owners have taken political stances before: In October 2016, the Houston Chronicle reported that the restaurant was allowing Trump supporters to hold a rally outside the East End location and film a music video for a pro-Trump anthem written by one of the leaders of the Houston Latino Trump Coalition. Counterprotesters also received permission to gather outside the restaurant, but Dominic Laurenzo told the paper that he was personally supporting Trump.\par \par \uc2 It's unclear how Sessions decided to dine at El Tiempo, but it was his second Mexican meal of the day.\u160\'00\'A0That morning, he had\u160\'00\'A0huevos rancheros\u160\'00\'A0and bacon with Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo at La Mexicana, a long-standing Mexican restaurant in the city, the Chronicle reported.\par \par \uc2 While the irony was duly noted by commentators on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , La Mexicana didn't tout Sessions's visit on social media, and the restaurant hasn't faced the same level of backlash.\par \par \uc2 Jeff Sessions eating huevos rancheros at a Mexican restaurant before giving a speech about the dangers of immigration more or less sums up America in 2018 {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://t.co/keRO1BwFpV"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://t.co/keRO1BwFpV}}}\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 Matt Novak (@paleofuture) August 11, 2018\par \par \uc2 Jeff Sessions had breakfast at La Mexicana and dinner at El Tiempo.

\par\par \uc2 A-Section\par {\*\bkmkstart toc56}{\*\bkmkend toc56}\b \uc2 For votes, candidates emulate Trump\b0\par\par\uc2 Jenna Johnson \par \uc2 1,388 \uc2 words\par \uc2 22 July 2018\par \uc2 The Washington Post\par \uc2 WP\par \uc2 FINAL\par A05\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2018, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved \par \par \uc2 ATLANTA - In last week's debate between Georgia's Republican candidates for governor, policy was quickly abandoned as \uc2 Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle\uc2  and Secretary of State \uc2 Brian Kemp\uc2  lit into one another with a familiar slate of accusations.\par \par \uc2 Kemp called Cagle a liar at least a dozen times. Cagle accused Kemp of conspiring with another Republican to release a recording of an "out of context" private conversation. Kemp accused Cagle of spreading "fake news" to Georgians, and Cagle repeatedly refused to apologize for saying what he says.\par \par \uc2 In a state where President Trump enjoys higher-than-average popularity, these two Republican candidates have not only bickered over which of them has supported the president the longest or who would more warmly embrace the Trump agenda, they've also started acting like the president, using some of his nastiest campaign tactics.\par \par \uc2 In races across the country, other Republican candidates - and some Democrats - also are branding their opponents with unflattering nicknames, tweeting in all caps, refusing to apologize for things that politicians once apologized for, being proudly politically incorrect, circulating false information, calling their hometown newspapers "fake news," releasing damaging information about their opponents and generating controversy to get headlines, even unflattering ones. A Republican candidate for California's state legislature, copying Trump's foray against President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 , launched a birther movement, demanding proof that his Democratic opponent is a legal citizen of the United States.\par \par \uc2 "Trump's style was such a departure from anything we were used to seeing in a presidential campaign - his willingness to just go all-out and criticize heavily someone, call them names and engage in schoolyard talk," said Kerwin Swint, a political-science professor at Kennesaw State University in Georgia. "Candidates this year are more willing to go there out of a sense that a precedent has been set or that it works or why not do it in my race."\par \par \uc2 But it's unclear if the tactics will work for many candidates other than Trump, who had a cachet with his voters unmatched by most seeking office.\par \par \uc2 "I don't like when candidates overly emulate the president. There's only one \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 ," said Harlan Z. Hill, a conservative consultant working on several midterm races who is also involved with Trump's 2020 campaign. Hill said he gets frustrated with candidates who use gimmicky nicknames like the president does.\par \par \uc2 "My biggest problem with this is that it sort of reflects a wider problem in the Republican Party right now, where people are paying lip service to the Trump movement," he said. "They really don't understand it, so they're just emulating the superficial aspects of it. I think voters see right through that."\par \par \uc2 But it can be difficult for voters to know whether candidates are emulating Trump out of belief or ambition.\par \par \uc2 Former soap-opera actor Antonio Sabato Jr. - who spoke at the 2016 Republican National Convention and is now running for Congress in Southern California - has called for \uc2 Rep. Maxine Waters\uc2  (D-Calif.), a Trump nemesis, to be locked up because he believes she is a "hustler of hate" who "wants to tar and feather anyone different from her." In Indiana, Trump-endorsed Senate candidate \uc2 Mike Braun\uc2  cast his primary opponents as "Todd the Fraud" and "Luke the Liberal." Iowa Republican Party Chairman Jeff Kaufmann has nicknamed a Democratic congressional candidate "Absent Abby," in hopes of drawing attention to her statehouse attendance record. Meanwhile, the Maryland Democratic Party has nicknamed Republican \uc2 Gov. Larry Hogan\uc2  "Hidin' Hogan" while accusing him of obscuring his conservative positions.\par \par \uc2 Some of the Trumpiest candidates - the sort who were early supporters of the president's campaign and decided to run for office themselves - aren't making it past the Republican primaries.\par \par \uc2 In northern Ohio's 16th Congressional District, state lawmaker Christina Hagan was inspired by Trump's 2016 victory to run for Congress, but she lost the primary to the Republican establishment's favorite, former football star Anthony Gonzalez. One of Hagan's commercials featured the same out-of-context footage of people rushing a Moroccan border that Trump used in one of his campaign commercials opposing illegal immigration. She also tweeted a news article about a suspect, with a name similar to her opponent's, who had been charged in connection with what she called an "\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  drug ring" - ignoring calls from fellow Republicans who asked her to delete the tweet.\par \par \uc2 In New York's 11th Congressional District, which includes Staten Island, former congressman \uc2 Michael Grimm\uc2  challenged Republican \uc2 Rep. Dan Donovan\uc2  but lost the primary. Grimm labeled his opponent "Desperate Dan" and "Dishonest Dan," and compared his own felony conviction for federal tax fraud to the ongoing investigation into whether the Trump campaign worked with Russia in 2016, a probe Grimm considers unfair and politically motivated.\par \par \uc2 The Trumpiest candidate in the Georgia governor's race was Michael Williams, a state senator who was one of the few elected officials in the country to endorse Trump in 2015. In the final days of the primary campaign, a struggling Williams received a burst of local and national attention for driving a "deportation bus" around the state.\par \par \uc2 Williams finished last in the primary, even losing the county where he lives. Cagle earned the most votes but not enough to become the party's nominee, so he and Kemp face a runoff Tuesday. Trump himself weighed in on Wednesday, giving Kemp his "full and total endorsement."\par \par \uc2 Voter turnout for primaries is often low - and it's often even lower for runoff elections, especially those held in the dead of summer. Local strategists and political scientists say that voters who do show up are likely to be the party's most loyal and most conservative members. That explains why Kemp has released so many ads featuring his guns and pickup truck, which he claims could be used to "round up criminal illegals." And it explains why Cagle is now catering to the far-right edge of the party.\par \par \uc2 "It's literally been hilarious to watch" said Seth Weathers, a former state director for Trump who worked on Williams's campaign, describing what he said was Cagle's transformation from moderate to Trump mimic.\par \par \uc2 "Just be who you are," he said, adding: "No one is Trump."\par \par \uc2 Soon after the May primary, Cagle met with one of the Republicans he beat, Clay Tippins, for a frank conversation that he hoped would lead to an endorsement. Tippins recorded the conversation and has been releasing parts of it. First came audio of Cagle saying that a bill providing public funding for private schools was "bad public policy" but he supported it to prevent a rival from gaining financial support from charter school supporters.\par \par \uc2 Last week, Kemp's campaign released a snippet it had received from Tippins in which Cagle says that the GOP primary came down to "who had the biggest gun, who had the biggest truck and who could be the craziest."\par \par \uc2 Kemp said that Cagle was trashing conservative voters. Cagle's aides said he was pointing out how crazy Kemp has made this race.\par \par \uc2 Cagle recorded a new commercial last week that was staged to look like a Trump rally. He stood in front of an American flag, surrounded by supporters, and yelled out his beliefs to a cheering crowd.\par \par \uc2 "I'll never apologize for outlawing sanctuary cities or stopping liberals from taking the values that make our country great," he said, delivering lines familiar to any Trump rally veteran.\par \par \uc2 In the debate last week, many of the buzzwords reflected 2016: "Colluding." "Lies." "Never going to apologize." "Hypocrite." "Despicable." "Fake news." After the debate, it continued as the candidates took reporters' questions.\par \par \uc2 "Casey Cagle's getting to be like \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  now," Kemp said. "He's gone after my 'crazy' supporters that have guns, trucks and chain saws. He's saying I'm colluding, and he's saying I'm sexist. That's the same thing that \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  said about \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 ."\par \par \uc2 Minutes later, Cagle complained with a line that could have come straight from Trump. No one could hear about his record as Georgia's lieutenant governor, he said, because "the only thing that my opponent can talk about is a tape - a tape!"\par \par \uc2 jenna.johnson@washpost.com \par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com\par \par \uc2 WP20180722trumpian\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020180722ee7m0002h\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved \par \par \uc2 ATLANTA - In last week's debate between Georgia's Republican candidates for governor, policy was quickly abandoned as \uc2 Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle\uc2  and Secretary of State \uc2 Brian Kemp\uc2  lit into one another with a familiar slate of accusations.\par \par \uc2 Kemp called Cagle a liar at least a dozen times. Cagle accused Kemp of conspiring with another Republican to release a recording of an "out of context" private conversation. Kemp accused Cagle of spreading "fake news" to Georgians, and Cagle repeatedly refused to apologize for saying what he says.\par \par \uc2 In a state where President Trump enjoys higher-than-average popularity, these two Republican candidates have not only bickered over which of them has supported the president the longest or who would more warmly embrace the Trump agenda, they've also started acting like the president, using some of his nastiest campaign tactics.\par \par \uc2 In races across the country, other Republican candidates - and some Democrats - also are branding their opponents with unflattering nicknames, tweeting in all caps, refusing to apologize for things that politicians once apologized for, being proudly politically incorrect, circulating false information, calling their hometown newspapers "fake news," releasing damaging information about their opponents and generating controversy to get headlines, even unflattering ones. A Republican candidate for California's state legislature, copying Trump's foray against President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 , launched a birther movement, demanding proof that his Democratic opponent is a legal citizen of the United States.\par \par \uc2 "Trump's style was such a departure from anything we were used to seeing in a presidential campaign - his willingness to just go all-out and criticize heavily someone, call them names and engage in schoolyard talk," said Kerwin Swint, a political-science professor at Kennesaw State University in Georgia. "Candidates this year are more willing to go there out of a sense that a precedent has been set or that it works or why not do it in my race."\par \par \uc2 But it's unclear if the tactics will work for many candidates other than Trump, who had a cachet with his voters unmatched by most seeking office.\par \par \uc2 "I don't like when candidates overly emulate the president. There's only one \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 ," said Harlan Z. Hill, a conservative consultant working on several midterm races who is also involved with Trump's 2020 campaign. Hill said he gets frustrated with candidates who use gimmicky nicknames like the president does.\par \par \uc2 "My biggest problem with this is that it sort of reflects a wider problem in the Republican Party right now, where people are paying lip service to the Trump movement," he said. "They really don't understand it, so they're just emulating the superficial aspects of it. I think voters see right through that."\par \par \uc2 But it can be difficult for voters to know whether candidates are emulating Trump out of belief or ambition.\par \par \uc2 Former soap-opera actor Antonio Sabato Jr. - who spoke at the 2016 Republican National Convention and is now running for Congress in Southern California - has called for \uc2 Rep. Maxine Waters\uc2  (D-Calif.), a Trump nemesis, to be locked up because he believes she is a "hustler of hate" who "wants to tar and feather anyone different from her." In Indiana, Trump-endorsed Senate candidate \uc2 Mike Braun\uc2  cast his primary opponents as "Todd the Fraud" and "Luke the Liberal." Iowa Republican Party Chairman Jeff Kaufmann has nicknamed a Democratic congressional candidate "Absent Abby," in hopes of drawing attention to her statehouse attendance record. Meanwhile, the Maryland Democratic Party has nicknamed Republican Gov. Larry Hogan "Hidin' Hogan" while accusing him of obscuring his conservative positions.\par \par \uc2 Some of the Trumpiest candidates - the sort who were early supporters of the president's campaign and decided to run for office themselves - aren't making it past the Republican primaries.\par \par \uc2 In northern Ohio's 16th Congressional District, state lawmaker Christina Hagan was inspired by Trump's 2016 victory to run for Congress, but she lost the primary to the Republican establishment's favorite, former football star Anthony Gonzalez. One of Hagan's commercials featured the same out-of-context footage of people rushing a Moroccan border that Trump used in one of his campaign commercials opposing illegal immigration. She also tweeted a news article about a suspect, with a name similar to her opponent's, who had been charged in connection with what she called an "\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  drug ring" - ignoring calls from fellow Republicans who asked her to delete the tweet.\par \par \uc2 In New York's 11th Congressional District, which includes Staten Island, former congressman \uc2 Michael Grimm\uc2  challenged Republican \uc2 Rep. Dan Donovan\uc2  but lost the primary. Grimm labeled his opponent "Desperate Dan" and "Dishonest Dan," and compared his own felony conviction for federal tax fraud to the ongoing investigation into whether the Trump campaign worked with Russia in 2016, a probe Grimm considers unfair and politically motivated.\par \par \uc2 The Trumpiest candidate in the Georgia governor's race was Michael Williams, a state senator who was one of the few elected officials in the country to endorse Trump in 2015. In the final days of the primary campaign, a struggling Williams received a burst of local and national attention for driving a "deportation bus" around the state.\par \par \uc2 Williams finished last in the primary, even losing the county where he lives. Cagle earned the most votes but not enough to become the party's nominee, so he and Kemp face a runoff Tuesday. Trump himself weighed in on Wednesday, giving Kemp his "full and total endorsement."\par \par \uc2 Voter turnout for primaries is often low - and it's often even lower for runoff elections, especially those held in the dead of summer. Local strategists and political scientists say that voters who do show up are likely to be the party's most loyal and most conservative members. That explains why Kemp has released so many ads featuring his guns and pickup truck, which he claims could be used to "round up criminal illegals." And it explains why Cagle is now catering to the far-right edge of the party.\par \par \uc2 "It's literally been hilarious to watch" said Seth Weathers, a former state director for Trump who worked on Williams's campaign, describing what he said was Cagle's transformation from moderate to Trump mimic.\par \par \uc2 "Just be who you are," he said, adding: "No one is Trump."\par \par \uc2 Soon after the May primary, Cagle met with one of the Republicans he beat, Clay Tippins, for a frank conversation that he hoped would lead to an endorsement. Tippins recorded the conversation and has been releasing parts of it. First came audio of Cagle saying that a bill providing public funding for private schools was "bad public policy" but he supported it to prevent a rival from gaining financial support from charter school supporters.\par \par \uc2 Last week, Kemp's campaign released a snippet it had received from Tippins in which Cagle says that the GOP primary came down to "who had the biggest gun, who had the biggest truck and who could be the craziest."\par \par \uc2 Kemp said that Cagle was trashing conservative voters. Cagle's aides said he was pointing out how crazy Kemp has made this race.\par \par \uc2 Cagle recorded a new commercial last week that was staged to look like a Trump rally. He stood in front of an American flag, surrounded by supporters, and yelled out his beliefs to a cheering crowd.\par \par \uc2 "I'll never apologize for outlawing sanctuary cities or stopping liberals from taking the values that make our country great," he said, delivering lines familiar to any Trump rally veteran.\par \par \uc2 In the debate last week, many of the buzzwords reflected 2016: "Colluding." "Lies." "Never going to apologize." "Hypocrite." "Despicable." "Fake news." After the debate, it continued as the candidates took reporters' questions.\par \par \uc2 "Casey Cagle's getting to be like \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  now," Kemp said. "He's gone after my 'crazy' supporters that have guns, trucks and chain saws. He's saying I'm colluding, and he's saying I'm sexist. That's the same thing that \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  said about \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 ."\par \par \uc2 Minutes later, Cagle complained with a line that could have come straight from Trump. No one could hear about his record as Georgia's lieutenant governor, he said, because "the only thing that my opponent can talk about is a tape - a tape!"\par \par \uc2 jenna.johnson@washpost.com \par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com\par \par \uc2 WP20180721trumpian\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020180721ee7l0000l\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 ATLANTA \u8212\'20\'14 In last week's debate between Georgia's Republican candidates for governor, policy was quickly abandoned as \uc2 Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle\uc2  and Secretary of State \uc2 Brian Kemp\uc2  lit into one another with a familiar slate of accusations.\par \par \uc2 Kemp called Cagle a liar at least a dozen times. Cagle accused Kemp of conspiring with another Republican to release a recording of an "out of context" private conversation. Kemp accused Cagle of spreading "fake news" to Georgians, and Cagle repeatedly refused to apologize for saying what he says.\par \par \uc2 In a state where President Trump enjoys higher-than-average popularity, these two Republican candidates have not only bickered over which of them has supported the president for the longest or who would most warmly embrace the Trump agenda, they've also started acting like the president, using some of his nastiest campaign tactics.\par \par \uc2 In races across the country, other Republican candidates \u8212\'20\'14 and some Democrats \u8212\'20\'14 also are branding their opponents with unflattering nicknames, tweeting in all caps, refusing to apologize for things that politicians once apologized for, being proudly politically incorrect, circulating false information, calling their hometown newspapers "fake news," releasing damaging information about their opponents and generating controversy to get headlines, even unflattering ones. A Republican candidate for California's state legislature, copying Trump's foray against President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 , has even launched a\u160\'00\'A0birther movement, demanding proof that his Democratic opponent is a legal citizen of the United States.\par \par \uc2 "Trump's style was such a departure from anything we were used to seeing in a presidential campaign \u8212\'20\'14 his willingness to just go all-out and criticize heavily someone, call them names and engage in schoolyard talk," said Kerwin Swint, a political-science professor at Kennesaw State University in Georgia. "Candidates this year are more willing to go there out of a sense that a precedent has been set or that it works or why not do it in my race."\par \par \uc2 But it's unclear if the tactics will work for many candidates other than Trump, who had a cachet with his voters unmatched by most seeking office.\par \par \uc2 "I don't like when candidates overly emulate the president. There's only one \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 ," said Harlan Z. Hill,\u160\'00\'A0a conservative consultant working on several midterm races who is also involved with Trump's 2020 campaign. Hill said he gets frustrated with candidates who use gimmicky nicknames like the president does.\par \par \uc2 "My biggest problem with this is that it sort of reflects a wider problem in the Republican Party right now, where people are paying lip service to the Trump movement, the 'America First' movement," he said. "They really don't understand it, so they're just emulating the superficial aspects of it. I think voters see right through that."\par \par \uc2 But it can be difficult for voters to know whether candidates are emulating Trump out of belief or ambition.\par \par \uc2 Former soap-opera actor Antonio Sabato Jr. \u8212\'20\'14 who spoke at the 2016 Republican National Convention and is now running for Congress in Southern California \u8212\'20\'14 has called for \uc2 Rep. Maxine Waters\uc2  (D-Calif.), a Trump nemesis, to be locked up because he believes she is a "hustler of hate" who "wants to tar and feather anyone different from her." In Indiana, Trump-endorsed Senate candidate \uc2 Mike Braun\uc2  cast his primary opponents as "Todd the Fraud" and "Luke the Liberal." Iowa Republican Party Chairman Jeff Kaufmann has nicknamed a Democratic congressional candidate "Absent Abby," in hopes of drawing attention to her statehouse attendance record. Meanwhile, the Maryland Democratic Party has nicknamed Republican \uc2 Gov. Larry Hogan\uc2  "Hidin' Hogan" while accusing him of obscuring his conservative positions.\par \par \uc2 Some of the Trumpiest candidates \u8212\'20\'14 the sort who were early supporters of the president's campaign and decided to run for office themselves \u8212\'20\'14 aren't making it past the Republican primaries.\par \par \uc2 In northern Ohio's 16th Congressional District, state lawmaker Christina Hagan was inspired by Trump's 2016 victory to run for Congress, but she lost the primary to the Republican establishment's favorite, former football star Anthony Gonzalez. One of Hagan's commercials featured the same out-of-context footage of people rushing a Moroccan border that Trump used in one of his campaign commercials opposing illegal immigration. She also tweeted a news article about a suspect, with a name similar to her opponent's, who had been charged in connection with what she called an "\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  drug ring" \u8212\'20\'14\u160\'00\'A0ignoring\u160\'00\'A0calls from fellow Republicans who asked her to delete the\u160\'00\'A0tweet.\par \par \uc2 In New York's 11th Congressional District, which includes Staten Island, former congressman \uc2 Michael Grimm\uc2  challenged Republican \uc2 Rep. Dan Donovan\uc2  but lost the primary. Grimm labeled his opponent "Desperate Dan" and "Dishonest Dan," and compared his own felony conviction for federal tax fraud to the ongoing investigation into whether the Trump campaign worked with Russia in 2016, a probe Grimm considers unfair and politically motivated.\par \par \uc2 The Trumpiest candidate in the Georgia governor's race was Michael Williams, a state senator who was one of the few elected officials in the country to endorse Trump in 2015. In the final days of the primary campaign, a struggling Williams received a burst of local and national attention for driving a "deportation bus" around the state, sparking a string of protests. It was a stunt that surprised some of Williams's supporters, who compared it with Trump purposely generating controversy so that he could dominate the news.\par \par \uc2 Williams finished last in the primary, even losing the county where he lives. Cagle earned the most votes but not enough to become the party's nominee, so he and Kemp face a runoff on July 24. A poll released by the \uc2 Atlanta Journal-Constitution\uc2  and Channel 2 Action News last week shows Kemp with a slight lead. Trump himself weighed in on Wednesday, giving Kemp his "full and total endorsement."\par \par \uc2 Voter turnout for primaries is often low \u8212\'20\'14 and it's often even lower for runoff elections, especially those held in the dead of summer. Local strategists and political scientists say that voters who do show up will likely be the party's most loyal and most conservative members. That explains why Kemp has released so many ads featuring his guns and pickup truck, which he claims in a southern drawl could be used to "round up criminal illegals." And it explains why Cagle is now catering to the far-right edge of the party.\par \par \uc2 "It's literally been hilarious to watch" said Seth Weathers, a former state director for Trump who worked on Williams's campaign, describing what he said was Cagle's transformation from moderate to Trump mimic.\par \par \uc2 "Just be who you are," he said, adding: "No one is Trump."\par \par \uc2 Soon after the May primary, Cagle met with one of the Republicans he beat, Clay Tippins, for a frank conversation that he hoped would lead to an endorsement. Tippins recorded the conversation and has been releasing parts of it. First came audio of Cagle saying that a bill providing public funding for private schools was "bad public policy" but he supported it to prevent a rival from gaining financial support from charter school supporters.\par \par \uc2 Last week, Kemp's campaign released a snippet it had received from Tippins in which Cagle says that the GOP primary came down to "who had the biggest gun, who had the biggest truck and who could be the craziest."\par \par \uc2 Kemp said that Cagle was trashing conservative voters with the comment, comparing it with \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  describing Trump's supporters as "deplorables." Cagle's aides said he was pointing out how crazy Kemp has made this race.\par \par \uc2 Cagle recorded a new commercial last week that was staged to look like a Trump rally. He stood in front of an American flag, surrounded by supporters, and yelled out his beliefs to a cheering crowd.\par \par \uc2 "I'll never apologize for outlawing sanctuary cities or stopping liberals from taking the values that make our country great," he said, delivering lines familiar to any Trump rally veteran. "The time for conservatives getting kicked around is over."\par \par \uc2 Cagle tweeted out the ad with a claim that his opponent was "in cahoots" with the media to push "fake news."\par \par \uc2 In the debate last week, many of the buzzwords reflected 2016: "Colluding." "Lies." "Never going to apologize." "Hypocrite." "Despicable." "Fake news." After the debate, it continued as the candidates answered questions from reporters.\par \par \uc2 "Casey Cagle's getting to be like \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  now," Kemp said. "He's gone after my 'crazy' supporters that have guns, trucks and chain saws. He's saying I'm colluding, and he's saying I'm sexist. That's the same thing that \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  said about \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 ."\par \par \uc2 Minutes later, Cagle complained with a line that could have come straight from Trump. No one could hear about his record as Georgia's lieutenant governor, he said, because "the only thing that my opponent can talk about is a tape \u8212\'20\'14 a tape!"\par \par \uc2 jenna.johnson@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020180715ee7f0040i\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

Here's the data to prove it. ; He's to the right of, and much more political than, his peers on the federal bench. \b0\par\par\uc2 By Elliott Ash;Daniel L. Chen \par \uc2 1,294 \uc2 words\par \uc2 13 July 2018\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2018, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Judges, particularly those on the Supreme Court, are expected to sit above the partisan fray. "I have no agenda," Chief Justice John Roberts said at his confirmation hearing. ".\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09.\u160\'00\'A0I will confront every case with an open mind." Supporters of \uc2 Brett Kavanaugh\uc2 , whom President Trump nominated to succeed \uc2 Anthony M. Kennedy\uc2  on Monday night, think that he follows in that tradition. The Weekly Standard said that his record won't "give any fair-minded lawmaker, Democrat or Republican, reason to conclude that he is anything but a first-rate legal mind." Kenneth Starr wrote in The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2  that Kavanaugh "deeply respect[s] both the democratic process and the structural principles undergirding our constitutional republic."\par \par \uc2 But according to a deep, data-driven survey of his writings from the bench, Kavanaugh is much like the man who selected him \u8212\'20\'14 highly divisive in his decisions and rhetoric. He is an uncommonly partisan judge, even compared with other federal appeals court judges. Trump is seizing this opportunity to shape a generation of U.S. jurisprudence, and the direction he's chosen is a hard right turn.\par \par \uc2 On the circuit court, Kavanaugh has tended to dissent more often along partisan lines than his peers, according to\u160\'00\'A0our research. He has justified his decisions with conservative doctrines far more frequently than his colleagues, citing politicized precedents consistent with other Republican-appointed judges, invoking the original articles of the Constitution (in line with the originalist jurisprudence favored by conservative jurists), and using the language of economics and free markets. What's more, Kavanaugh's divisiveness has ramped up during campaign season: He has disagreed with his colleagues more often before elections, suggesting that he feels personally invested in national politics.\par \par \uc2 These findings stem from our work as social scientists who use data to understand the U.S. legal system and the decisions of judges. Although we can't read their minds, new data technologies allow us to sift through judges' records for insights into their worldviews and political values. Through his published decisions on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit (where he has reviewed cases since 2006), Kavanaugh provides ample material for this type of data-driven investigation. Through the published decisions of all 26 appellate judges who sat on at least fifty circuit cases and later served on the Supreme Court from 1946 to 2016, these metrics predict Supreme Court decisions.\par \par \uc2 In federal appeals courts, cases are usually decided by three-judge panels. Across the D.C. Circuit during Kavanaugh's tenure there, 3 percent of the votes were dissents. But Kavanaugh has cast a dissenting vote 7 percent of the time out of the 407 published cases he heard until 2013. When Kavanaugh authored an opinion, 14 percent of the time his co-panelists dissented against him, compared with 10 percent of opinions that provoked dissents when he wasn't the author. In contrast to this rift-making, Trump's prior nominee, Justice \uc2 Neil M. Gorsuch\uc2  \u8212\'20\'14 as well as previous nominees rejected for being divisive, such as \uc2 Merrick Garland\uc2  and Robert Bork \u8212\'20\'14 generated more agreement than Kavanaugh relative to their peers on the opinions they wrote.\par \par \uc2 We also found that Kavanaugh has been extremely polarizing in his votes. We measured how judges' dissents vary with the party affiliation of the president who appointed them. (For the sake of our research, judges elevated by a Republican president are "Republicans," and vice versa.) Judges who tend to dissent mostly against those appointed by the opposing party's president contribute to "vote polarization." When sitting with two panelists appointed by Democrats, which occured 56 times, Kavanaugh dissented 19 percent of the time; in other cases, he dissented 5 percent of the time, which is nearly double the rate of his colleagues. His vote polarization is especially clear in cases relating to constitutional, civil rights and due process law. (In a recent abortion\u160\'00\'A0case, for example, he dissented against the Democratic-controlled majority's ruling that guaranteed an undocumented immigrant's right to an abortion while in state custody.) Gorsuch and Bork, by contrast, did not display the same degree of vote polarization. Garland was actually more likely to cross party lines than his D.C. Circuit colleagues were.\par \par \uc2 Another way dissents can provide evidence of polarization is when they respond to external political factors. A\u160\'00\'A0forthcoming paper\u160\'00\'A0by Daniel L. Chen with\u160\'00\'A0Carlos Berdej\u243\'00\'F3\u160\'00\'A0shows that circuit court judges tend to dissent more in the run-up to presidential elections, consistent with a (perhaps subconscious) political cheerleading motive or\u160\'00\'A0affect\u160\'00\'A0related to partisan identity. Kavanaugh has been an exemplar of this trend. Beginning the February before a presidential election, Kavanaugh has dissented 15 percent of the time; at other times, he has dissented in just 5 percent of cases. (Other judges in his circuit dissented 3 percent right before an election and 2 percent in other periods.) Kavanaugh's "electoral dissent" is especially prevalent on highly political topics such as economic regulation, constitutional law and due process. Gorsuch, Garland and Bork were significantly less affected by external politics.\par \par \uc2 Kavanaugh is a partisan warrior even in his legal citations. When justifying his rulings, he tends to cite precedents that have a Republican slant: In\u160\'00\'A0Adeyemi v. District of Columbia\u160\'00\'A0, putting limits on employee discrimination claims, he quoted conservative precedent articulating "an employer's unfettered discretion" over hiring and firing. He often cites original articles of the Constitution, especially Article II, which is associated with originalism and expanded executive power. He also invokes more economics language than his colleagues do, using market-oriented arguments\u160\'00\'A0associated\u160\'00\'A0with deregulatory policy goals. In\u160\'00\'A0United States v. Bullock\u160\'00\'A0, for instance, he used a risk-harm calculus to determine the propriety of police searches.\par \par \uc2 These partisan views also emerge in a "sentiment analysis" of Kavanaugh's opinions. Using the relative positive or negative sentiment of his language (words like "favorable" and "warm" vs. words like "unfavorable" or "cold"), we found that Kavanaugh has tended to speak positively of conservatism and negatively of liberalism. More so than his colleagues, he has expressed dislike toward Congress and the federal government, as well as working-class groups (labor unions and farmers).\par \par \uc2 Kavanaugh's dissent in\u160\'00\'A0Agri Processor Co., Inc. v. \uc2 NLRB\uc2 \u160\'00\'A0illustrates his unenthusiastic attitude toward labor: "Their immigration status apparently unbeknownst to their employer, \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  workers voted in a union election and affected the election's outcome. The employer later discovered that the workers were illegal; terminated them as required by federal immigration law; and sought to overturn the tainted union election."\par \par \uc2 A broader comparison of his\u160\'00\'A0writing style\u160\'00\'A0to those of sitting Supreme Court justices shows that Kavanaugh's opinions are closest to those of \uc2 Samuel Alito\uc2 , a \uc2 George W. Bush\uc2  appointee who is\u160\'00\'A0known\u160\'00\'A0to be on the conservative fringe. But as a circuit judge, Alito was\u160\'00\'A0less\u160\'00\'A0extreme than Kavanaugh in terms of dissents, vote polarization, electoral dissents and citations of partisan precedents. Kavanaugh is ranked in the 1st percentile of judges based on partisan dissents (those written against two judges appointed by the opposing party), the 1st percentile for electoral dissents, the 3rd percentile for overall dissent rate, and the 13th percentile for generating dissents by colleagues when he is the opinion author. Compared to other Circuit Court judges elevated to the Supreme Court since the 1980s, Kavanaugh gets the top spot on all these measures.\par \par \uc2 Kavanaugh is an outlier judge; he would not be your average justice. On the evidence derived from the content of his decisions, he would be more radical than his colleagues.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020180710ee7a00566\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

Moyer \par \uc2 480 \uc2 words\par \uc2 13 July 2018\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2018, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 A sign in Calvert County, Md., that says "liberal pigs" are more worried about "\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  children" than unborn children has taken the place of\u160\'00\'A0a controversial pro-Trump sign taken down earlier this year.\par \par \uc2 The first sign, posted\u160\'00\'A0near the intersection of\u160\'00\'A0Solomons Island Road and Bowie Shop Road in Huntingtown about 35 miles southeast of Washington, was widely shared on social media in May before it was taken down voluntarily by its owner after the Calvert County Sheriff's Office received complaints.\par \par \uc2 "Hey liberals better get your guns if you try to impeach President Trump," the sign read. "From all of your deplorables in Calvert County."\par \par \uc2 At the time, Capt. Dave Payne of the Calvert County Sheriff's Office said the sign's owner, whom he did not identify, often posts controversial messages, and the community was "50-50 on the complaint."\par \par \uc2 "No one seems to feel that it is an illegal sign," he said. "It's definitely controversial. And so as far as us doing anything legally, there's not a whole lot for us to do at this point." He added: "Life's definitely easier if the controversial sign is not up."\par \par \uc2 On Thursday, Bob Somerville, a senior editor at AARP Foundation who lives in Calvert County, sent pictures of a new sign to The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "Hey liberals we're back!!!" the sign read. "Hope you enjoyed your 30 day break. You are more worried about \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  children .\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09. but you fund \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2  to separate unborn children from their parents .\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09. no pity for them. Bunch of liberal pigs .\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09. from all your deplorables in Calvert County."\par \par \uc2 Acting captain Tim Friedman of the Calvert County Sheriff's Office confirmed the sign was there.\par \par \uc2 "I spoke to the sheriff and there's nothing threatening," Friedman said. "It does not rise to a law enforcement concern."\par \par \uc2 Sheriff Mike Evans (R), who is running for reelection, said he knows the man who rents out space on the sign but wouldn't release his name. He said the man gave him space on the sign as an in-kind contribution during the Republican primary, which\u160\'00\'A0he won earlier this month, and he ran a campaign ad on the sign.\par \par \uc2 "I believe in freedom of speech," he said. "The last message I thought was a little much. This is freedom of speech. That's nothing criminal. There's nothing I can do about it."\par \par \uc2 Somerville said the signs made him angry and sad.\par \par \uc2 "It conflates immigrant children with the abortion issue," he said. "It's completely ridiculous. These angry so-called pro-lifers don't care about a child after the moment of birth."\par \par \uc2 \u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020180713ee7d004v1\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 We're doing something new: analyzing every factual claim from President Trump's campaign rally in Montana on Thursday.\par \par \uc2 According to The Fact Checker's database, the president had made 3,251 false or misleading claims at the end of May, and his average daily rate was climbing.\par \par \uc2 This side of Trump really comes alive during campaign rallies, so we wanted to do the math and find out whether the president speaks more fictions or facts in front of his crowds.\par \par \uc2 We focused only on Trump's statements of material fact at the Montana rally, avoiding trivialities and opinions. We didn't double-count statements when the president repeated himself.\par \par \uc2 According to our analysis, the truth took a beating in Montana. From a grand total of 98 factual statements we identified, 76 percent were false, misleading or unsupported by evidence.\par \par \uc2 Here's a breakdown: 45 false or mostly false statements, 25 misleading statements and four unsupported claims. We also counted 24 accurate or mostly accurate statements. False or mostly false statements alone accounted for 46 percent of all claims.\par \par \uc2 Trump's rallies draw huge crowds \u8212\'20\'14 an estimated 6,500 people attended the Thursday rally \u8212\'20\'14 and they usually provide days of fodder for TV networks. Because three-quarters of the president's claims in Montana were false, misleading or unsupported, there is a need to fact-check these events.\par \par \uc2 Here's our analysis of all 98 claims:\par \par \uc2 It's time to retire liberal Democrat Jon Tester.\par \par \uc2 Misleading.\u160\'00\'A0Sen. Tester (Mont.) has voted with Trump 36.5 percent of the time, according to FiveThirtyEight, and is more on the moderate side of the Democratic Party than the liberal side.\par \par \uc2 Jon Tester voted no on repealing Obamacare.\par \par \uc2 Accurate. Tester opposed Republican efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.\par \par \uc2 And even though we got a little surprise vote that evening, you all remember that evening somebody came in with a thumbs down after campaigning for years that he was going to repeal and replace.\par \par \uc2 Mostly false. Trump is referring to \uc2 Sen. John McCain\uc2  (R-Ariz.), who voted no on one of the bills to roll back the Affordable Care Act in 2017. McCain complained that the bill had not gone through regular order in the Senate, meaning it was being rushed to passage without the usual vetting. Trump suggests that McCain single-handedly killed the bill, but two other Republicans also voted no, and even if it passed the Senate, there would have been more wrangling during a conference with the House.\par \par \uc2 But that's okay because we, for the most part, have already done it. \u8230\'20\'26 We got rid of the individual mandate and lots of other things.\par \par \uc2 Mostly false. The Affordable Care Act's individual mandate was repealed in Trump's Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, but other core provisions such as insurance exchanges and mandating coverage for preexisting conditions remain.\par \par \uc2 Jon Tester voted no on tax cuts for Montana families.\par \par \uc2 Accurate. Tester voted against the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\par \par \uc2 He voted no on cutting the estate tax or the death tax for your farms, your farmers, and your small businesses. \u8230\'20\'26 But you got it anyway because we got it passed. So, on your farms, for the most part, you will have no estate tax or death tax to pay. You can leave your farm, you can leave your small business to your children or whoever you want to leave them.\par \par \uc2 False. The federal estate tax rarely falls on farms or small businesses, since only those leaving behind more than $5 million pay it. According to the \uc2 Tax Policy Center\uc2 , nearly 5,500 estates in 2017 \u8212\'20\'14 out of nearly 3 million \u8212\'20\'14 were subject to the tax. Of those, only 80 taxable estates would be farms and small businesses.\par \par \uc2 Jon Tester voted no on legislation to stop late-term abortions.\par \par \uc2 Accurate. Tester voted against the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which would have banned abortion after 20 weeks of gestation.\par \par \uc2 Jon Tester voted no on Kate's Law.\par \par \uc2 Accurate. Tester voted against an earlier version of Kate's Law. The current version passed the House in 2017 but has not come up for a vote in the Senate.\par \par \uc2 You know what Kate's Law is. That's legislation named for \uc2 Kate Steinle\uc2 , who was gunned down by a five-time-deported \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Accurate. The man who shot the gun that killed Steinle in San Francisco, \uc2 Jose Ines Garcia Zarate\uc2 , had been deported to Mexico five times. Garcia was acquitted of murder and manslaughter charges, but was convicted of being a felon who possessed a firearm.\par \par \uc2 Tester even voted no on enhanced vetting for refugees from terror-stricken countries.\par \par \uc2 Accurate. Tester in 2016 voted against legislation that would have added additional background checks for refugees trying to enter the United States. He also opposed the president's travel ban.\par \par \uc2 The Democrats want open borders, which means lots of crime.\par \par \uc2 False. Democrats support measures to tighten border security, but they don't support Trump's plans for a border wall or other parts of his aggressive immigration agenda. There's no evidence to show that immigration leads to higher crime. In fact, most studies have found that legal and undocumented immigrants commit crimes at lower rates than the native-born.\par \par \uc2 Jon Tester opposed our travel ban to keep America safe, which, by the way, I'm proud to report that last week the \uc2 Supreme Court of the United States\uc2  just upheld the Trump travel ban.\par \par \uc2 Accurate. Tester opposes Trump's travel ban, which the Supreme Court upheld in a 5-4 vote.\par \par \uc2 And I want to thank Justice Kennedy for his lifetime of truly distinguished service. And he had confidence in me. He left because he said, "You're going to pick somebody great, and so nice."\par \par \uc2 Unsupported. Justice \uc2 Anthony M. Kennedy\uc2  met with Trump the day his retirement was announced, but it would be out of character for him or any judge to say this to the president. A statement from the Supreme Court said Kennedy, 81, retired because of a "deep desire to spend more time" with his family.\par \par \uc2 Jon Tester voted against \uc2 Neil Gorsuch\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Accurate.\par \par \uc2 He never votes for me.\par \par \uc2 False. Tester votes with Trump 36.5 percent of the time, according to FiveThirtyEight. He has voted to confirm several of the president's Cabinet officials and has supported major pieces of legislation Trump supported including a rollback of some Dodd-Frank regulations and expanding private care options for veterans.\par \par \uc2 Yes, Jon Tester voted for liberal Obama judges who tried to take away your Second Amendment.\par \par \uc2 Misleading. It's not clear which judges Trump is referring to, but Tester has an "A-" rating from the \uc2 National Rifle Association\uc2 . His website states, "As a gun owner, Jon has voted against legislation that would violate Montanans' Second Amendment rights and hinder the ability of law-abiding citizens to purchase and own a gun." Tester voted to confirm Justice \uc2 Sonia Sotomayor\uc2 , who dissented from the court's 2010 decision McDonald v. Chicago, which expanded gun-possession rights. But she also dissented in Voisine v. United States, which restricted gun rights for people convicted of domestic violence misdemeanors.\par \par \uc2 Jon Tester showed his true colors with his shameful, dishonest attacks on a great man, a friend of mine, a man that I said, "Why don't you run the VA? You'd be great," Navy Admiral \uc2 Ronny Jackson\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 And a report just came out, and I should have brought it because I would have read it, but it's long but beautiful for \uc2 Ronny Jackson\uc2 . Secret Service are all over the place. And they wrote a report that what he said was so false and so untrue.\par \par \uc2 Misleading. Tester, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Veteran Affairs Committee, made public several allegations against Jackson. The White House conducted a review that found evidence of minor incidents but not the most serious allegations Tester had described, and the Secret Service released a statement denying several allegations. The Defense Department inspector general is investigating Jackson but has not released a report.\u160\'00\'A0Republicans believed Jackson to be unqualified, and Tester's actions had the support of Veterans' Affairs Committee chairman, \uc2 Sen. Johnny Isakson\uc2  (R-Ga.).\par \par \uc2 And when they said I'm very healthy, the news was devastated. They were devastated. They didn't want to hear that. They didn't want to hear that.\par \par \uc2 False.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 I won Montana by so many points I don't have to come here. You know, a lot of people from states where we have these crazy big leads, we had 42 and 44 \u8212\'20\'14 we won by 44 points over a Democrat, over a Democrat. We won by 44 points over a Democrat. Now it was Crooked Hillary, but still she's a Democrat.\par \par \uc2 False. Trump defeated \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  in Montana by 20 points, not 42 or 44.\par \par \uc2 She gets special treatment under the Justice Department.\par \par \uc2 False. Trump suggests the Justice Department went easy on Clinton while investigating her use of a private email server as secretary of state, but then-FBI Director \uc2 James B. Comey\uc2  gave detailed reasons for declining to bring charges and took the extraordinary step of rebuking Clinton in public shortly before the 2016 election. The Justice Department inspector general found "no evidence that the conclusions by department prosecutors were affected by bias or other improper considerations" and said Comey acted inappropriately in calling her out before the election.\par \par \uc2 How about that FBI agent? How about that guy? \u8230\'20\'26 You think there was just a little bias there \u8212\'20\'14 a little bias? Oh, did we catch them in the act. It's a rigged deal, folks.\par \par \uc2 Misleading. Trump is referring to Peter Strzok, an FBI agent who worked on the Clinton email investigation and who spent two months working on the Russia investigation. The inspector general's report criticizes Strzok and other \uc2 FBI\uc2  officials for sending numerous text messages showing anti-Trump bias or frustration with the fact that the \uc2 FBI\uc2  was investigating Clinton, and for dragging their feet on the Clinton probe at one stage. The inspector general found that these communications showed "extremely poor judgment and a gross lack of professionalism," but did not conclude the investigations were "rigged" against Trump. Special counsel \uc2 Robert S. Mueller III\uc2  removed Strzok from his team when he became aware that Strzok had sent anti-Trump text messages.\par \par \uc2 I'm going to tell \uc2 NATO\uc2 , "You got to start paying your bills. The United States is not going to take care of everything."\par \par \uc2 Misleading. \uc2 NATO\uc2 's guideline is that defense expenditures should amount to 2 percent of each country's gross domestic product by 2024. In 2017, the United States and three other countries met that standard, and Poland spent virtually 2 percent. \uc2 NATO\uc2  allies have been steadily boosting defense spending since 2014, after Russia annexed Crimea. In any case, these funds would not be going to the United States or even necessarily to \uc2 NATO\uc2 ; this is money that countries would spend to bolster their own military.\par \par \uc2 We're paying for anywhere from 70 to 90 percent to protect Europe, and that's fine.\par \par \uc2 Misleading. The United States is the largest contributor to \uc2 NATO\uc2 's organizational expenses, which includes its headquarters in Brussels and subordinate military commands, but it funds only 22 percent of these programs. Separately, the U.S. defense expenditure represents 72 percent of defense spending across \uc2 NATO\uc2 . But this reflects what the United States spends on all military programs, not just those related to Europe.\par \par \uc2 Of course, they kill us on trade. \u8230\'20\'26 They make it impossible to do business in Europe, and yet they come in and they sell their Mercedes and their BMWs to us. So we have $151 billion in trade deficits with the E.U., and on top of that, they kill us with \uc2 NATO\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 False. The \uc2 European Union\uc2  is the largest goods trade partner for the United States. Trump has a habit of using trade numbers that factor in only goods, not services. The combined trade deficit with the E.U. was $92 billion in 2016. Although the E.U. imposes a 10 percent tariff on U.S. cars, while the U.S. tariff is 2.5 percent for European cars, tariff rates vary by product and in some cases U.S. tariffs are higher.\par \par \uc2 So we pay 4 percent of a huge GDP, which got a lot bigger since I became your president.\par \par \uc2 Misleading. The United States spends close to 4 percent of gross domestic product on defense, but GDP growth under Trump has been par for the course. GDP grew 2.3 percent in 2017, Trump's first year in office. It grew at a faster rate in three of the years \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  was in office and for much of the \uc2 George W. Bush\uc2  and \uc2 Bill Clinton\uc2  administrations.\par \par \uc2 Germany, which is the biggest country of the E.U., \uc2 European Union\uc2 , Germany pays 1 percent.\par \par \uc2 Mostly accurate. Germany increased its defense spending by 5 percent in 2017, but because the country saw healthy economic growth, defense spending was 1.2 percent of its GDP. German leaders say they plan to reach 1.5 percent by 2024.\par \par \uc2 And then they go out and make a gas deal, oil and gas, from Russia, where they pay billions and billions of dollars to Russia. Okay, so they want to protect against Russia, and yet they pay billions of dollars to Russia, and we are the schmucks that are paying for the whole thing.\par \par \uc2 False. Germany in March approved an $11 billion pipeline, \uc2 Nord Stream 2\uc2 , to be built by Russian energy giant \uc2 Gazprom\uc2 . But the United States is not "paying for the whole thing," not even by some logic that factors in U.S. spending on \uc2 NATO\uc2 . Germany is the second-highest contributor to \uc2 NATO\uc2 's common programs. The United States pays 22 percent of these costs; Germany pays 15 percent.\par \par \uc2 Since I came, which is a year and a half, almost $33 billion more is projected to be paid by those \uc2 NATO\uc2  nations, but it's not enough.\par \par \uc2 Misleading. \uc2 NATO\uc2  member nations pledged to end defense cuts and began to ramp up spending in 2014, years before Trump took office.\par \par \uc2 I will tell you, the secretary general, [Jens] Stoltenberg, is Trump's biggest fan. He says, those \uc2 NATO\uc2  nations are going like this, less money, less money. \u8230\'20\'26 And when you started talking, it went like a rocket ship.\par \par \uc2 Mostly accurate. During a visit to Washington in May, Stoltenberg said Trump had made a "real impact" pushing for more defense spending from \uc2 NATO\uc2  allies. But, again, this trend began in 2014, after Russia annexed Crimea. And there was no mention of a metaphorical "rocket ship" in Stoltenberg's public remarks.\par \par \uc2 I love Russia. I will say this, I am meeting with President Putin next week and getting along\u160\'00\'A0\u8212\'20\'14 let me tell you, getting along with Russia and getting along with China and getting along with other countries is a good thing.\par \par \uc2 Misleading. Russia is not a friendly nation to the United States. It has been widely determined by U.S. intelligence agencies, Justice Department officials and congressional investigators that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election.\par \par \uc2 Take a look at what's happened. Take a look: We've just increased our military spending. We are at $700 billion.\par \par \uc2 Accurate. The military budget is $700 billion this year.\par \par \uc2 We've become a nation that is exporting energy for the first time.\par \par \uc2 False. The United States has long been an energy exporter, and since 2015 has exported more than it has imported.\par \par \uc2 We have North Korea, where you noticed eight months \u8212\'20\'14 so, during the Obama administration, it seemed like a missile a week. I mean a lot of missiles going up, a lot of rockets going up, a lot of nuclear testing.\par \par \uc2 False. North Korea conducted 74 missile tests during the Obama administration, or roughly one test every five and a half weeks. The rate was far higher during Trump's first year in office: 20 tests, or roughly one test every two and a half weeks.\par \par \uc2 First of all, we got our prisoners back before I even went, right?\par \par \uc2 Accurate. North Korea released three American hostages in May, before Trump's summit with Kim on June 12 in Singapore.\par \par \uc2 And I didn't pay $1.8 billion, by the way, in cash. \u8230\'20\'26 We paid nothing.\par \par \uc2 Misleading.\u160\'00\'A0Trump is comparing his dealings with North Korea to Obama's dealings with Iran. The money in question \u8212\'20\'14 which was actually $1.7 billion \u8212\'20\'14 was Iran's all along, and was sent by the Obama administration to settle a decades-old claim. U.S. officials insist it was a coincidence that four American hostages, including The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2 's Jason Rezaian, were released the same day as the first $400 million tranche was delivered.\par \par \uc2 We signed a wonderful paper saying they're going to denuclearize their whole thing. It's going to all happen.\par \par \uc2 Misleading. The June 12 joint statement signed by Trump and Kim is vaguely worded and does not ensure that North Korea will abandon its nuclear weapons. The Trump administration continues to negotiate parameters with North Korea.\par \par \uc2 Obama was very close to going to war.\par \par \uc2 Unsupported. Trump claims Obama told him he was ready to go to war with North Korea, but Obama has never said this.\par \par \uc2 You have 30 million people in Seoul. It's 30 miles off the border. And that's a tough border. Thousands of cannons, they call them. These are big, big guns. I'm not even talking about nuclear. You could have lost 30, 40, 50 million people. You could have had a war like you haven't had in a long time.\par \par \uc2 Misleading. North Korea does have thousands of rocket launchers and artillery positioned toward South Korea. According to the \uc2 Congressional Research Service\uc2 , these weapons are believed to be able to fire 10,000 rounds per minute at Seoul and kill between 30,000 and 300,000 South Koreans "in the first days of fighting." The CRS report adds that "an escalation of a military conflict on the peninsula could affect upwards of 25 million people on either side of the border."\par \par \uc2 And guess what you have now? Eight months, no nuclear testing, no missiles, no anything.\par \par \uc2 Misleading. North Korea has not tested missiles since November 2017, but experts say and satellite imagery indicates that its nuclear research efforts have not ceased.\par \par \uc2 Obama couldn't meet. They wouldn't see him.\par \par \uc2 False. Obama never requested a meeting with North Korea.\par \par \uc2 So I didn't have, like [Bill] Clinton, where they gave him billions and billions of dollars and got nothing.\par \par \uc2 False. Clinton's administration did not give "billions and billions of dollars" to North Korea. According to PolitiFact, the Clinton administration extended $666 million in aid, and experts say an agreement between the two nations\u160\'00\'A0at the time \u8212\'20\'14 although it ultimately failed\u160\'00\'A0\u8212\'20\'14 helped restrain North Korea's development of nuclear weapons.\par \par \uc2 They [the media] make the sources up. They don't exist in many cases. Any time you say \u8212\'20\'14 you know, I saw one of them said "15 anonymous sources" \u8212\'20\'14 I don't have 15 people in the White House.\par \par \uc2 False. More than 370 people work in the White House. Trump has a history of speaking anonymously to reporters.\par \par \uc2 Just heard @POTUSat this rally complaining about the use of anonymous sources. For the record he was one of mine over the years.\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 Charles Gasparino (@CGasparino) July 5, 2018\par \par \uc2 Wages are going up.\par \par \uc2 Accurate. Wages have been increasing steadily since 2014.\par \par \uc2 A vote for the Democrats in November is a vote to let MS-13 run wild in our communities. \u8230\'20\'26 Democrats want anarchy. They really do.\par \par \uc2 False. Democrats support measures to tighten border security, but they don't support Trump's plans for a border wall or other parts of his aggressive immigration agenda. Democrats don't support MS-13.\par \par \uc2 She is a low-IQ individual, \uc2 Maxine Waters\uc2 . \u8230\'20\'26 She's somewhere in the mid-60s, I believe that.\par \par \uc2 False.\par \par \uc2 There's no collusion. No collusion. After spending $22 million, it's awfully tough.\par \par \uc2 False. The special counsel continues to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 election and there's no word yet whether Trump's campaign colluded with the Russians. It's not clear where Trump gets this $22 million figure. At last count, the special counsel had reported $17 million in costs, which is inside the norm for such investigations.\par \par \uc2 And the House just left and they said, "There's no collusion." Can you imagine this? It's all a ruse.\par \par \uc2 Mostly accurate. The House Intelligence Committee's Republican majority released a report that found "no evidence" of collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign. But the report said investigations "by other committees, the special counsel, the media, or interest groups will continue and may find facts that were not readily accessible to the Committee or outside the scope of our investigation." Democrats on the committee strongly disagreed with the report's conclusions, noting that there were many documented contacts between Trump campaign officials and Russian actors during the campaign.\par \par \uc2 [The Russia probe] was an excuse for the Democrats who lost an election.\par \par \uc2 False. The special counsel's office has indicted or secured plea deals from 20 people and three companies including four former Trump advisers. Plus, the U.S. intelligence agencies have said they have "high confidence" that Russia interfered in the 2016 election.\par \par \uc2 Foxconn \u8230\'20\'26 they are going to spend like $11 billion, and this is going to be about a $15 billion plant. \u8230\'20\'26 Fifteen thousand jobs to Wisconsin.\par \par \uc2 Misleading. Foxconn is planning to invest $10 billion in a Wisconsin plant and to employ 13,000 workers.\par \par \uc2 But think of Wisconsin. Reagan had his big win. He won every state except for one, the great state of Wisconsin. I won Wisconsin. First time \u8212\'20\'14 first time since \uc2 Dwight Eisenhower\uc2  in 1952.\par \par \uc2 False. This is totally ahistorical. Republicans have won Wisconsin six times since 1952. \uc2 Ronald Reagan\uc2  won twice in the 1980s. \uc2 Richard Nixon\uc2  won three times in the 1960s and 1970s. Eisenhower won in 1956 after winning in 1952.\par \par \uc2 And we won Michigan. And we won Pennsylvania, North Carolina and South Carolina and Florida, we ran up that East Coast.\par \par \uc2 Mostly accurate. But the Northeastern states and Virginia did not vote for Trump.\par \par \uc2 Winning the electoral college is very tough for a Republican, much tougher than the so-called popular vote, where people vote four times, you know.\par \par \uc2 False. Republicans often win the presidency. Trump's suggestion that he lost the popular vote to Clinton because of voter fraud is not supported by any evidence.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  was ready to fold. It was going to close. And then I came along.\par \par \uc2 False. The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  was not going to close.\par \par \uc2 [Elizabeth Warren] proclaims that she's of Indian heritage because her mother says she has high cheekbones. That's her only evidence, that her mother said she had high cheekbones.\par \par \uc2 False. Although there's no hard evidence to support Warren's claim of Native American ancestry, she has cited family lore and not just a stray remark from her mother about her cheekbones.\par \par \uc2 I have broken more Elton John records. He seems to have a lot of records and we beat \u8212\'20\'14 and I, by the way, I don't have a musical instrument.\par \par \uc2 False. New York magazine found that Elton John draws much bigger crowds than Trump.\par \par \uc2 How about the one from The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2 ? They got there four hours early and the arena hadn't started even letting people in. So there was just a few people, you all saw that story, I hope. You all saw that story, right? They got there four hours, five hours \u8212\'20\'14 this writer, sleazebag \u8212\'20\'14 he didn't get fired. \u8230\'20\'26 And I didn't see this story but you know who saw the story? The people that were in the arena and they went nuts. And they apologized, but you know where they apologized? On \uc2 Twitter\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 False. A Washington Post reporter tweeted a picture of a Trump rally before it filled up, but when he was alerted, he removed the tweet and apologized to Trump on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 . The Post did not publish a story that incorrectly described the crowd size at this Trump event.\par \par \uc2 And by the way, hate to say it, take a look at the pictures for the inauguration. We had some monster crowd. Big, monster \u8212\'20\'14 big monster \u8212\'20\'14 but take a look at that.\par \par \uc2 Misleading. Photographs from the \uc2 National Park Service\uc2  show a partially filled Mall for Trump's inauguration.\par \par \uc2 The new platform of the Democrat party is to abolish ICE. In other words, they want to abolish immigration enforcement entirely. That's what they want to do.\par \par \uc2 Misleading. Some Democrats have been calling to abolish \uc2 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2 , but it's not a widely held position and some Democrats say the agency should be reformed, not abolished. In any case, ICE is only one of several agencies tasked with immigration enforcement.\par \par \uc2 When you have these MS-13 thugs come in, ICE goes in and wipes them out like nothing because they're much tougher. They wipe them out and they liberate towns and on Long Island and other places. You know, it's like you're occupied. It's like a nation is occupying your country.\par \par \uc2 False. MS-13 has a large presence in Long Island and other places, but it's a serious exaggeration to say ICE has "liberated" towns from MS-13.\par \par \uc2 So we're taking them out by the thousands. And if it weren't for ICE, we wouldn't be doing it.\par \par \uc2 False. There's no evidence that "thousands" of MS-13 members have been deported. Hundreds, yes. Thousands, no.\par \par \uc2 These are savage gangs, MS-13 and others.\par \par \uc2 Accurate. MS-13 is known for its gory violence and a preference for edged weapons.\par \par \uc2 Getting military funding from these Democrats is almost impossible. They don't want it, they don't care about military, they don't care about our law enforcement. They couldn't give a damn.\par \par \uc2 False. Many Democrats voted for the $1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill Trump signed in March 2018, which provides $700 billion for the military.\par \par \uc2 We are already building the wall. It started in California, in San Diego, $1.6 billion.\par \par \uc2 False. Trump has not secured funding for his promised border wall. The $1.6 billion he's referring to comes with strings attached and cannot be used for the wall. It's designated for a stretch of bollard-style fencing near San Diego.\par \par \uc2 We've created 3.4 million jobs since Election Day.\par \par \uc2 Mostly accurate. It's actually 3.6 million since November 2016, and 3.2 million since Trump took office January 2017.\par \par \uc2 Unemployment claims are at a 45-year low. African American and Hispanic American unemployment have reached the lowest levels in the history of our country.\par \par \uc2 Mostly accurate. These numbers fluctuate from month to month, but they have been at historic lows under Trump. However, the black unemployment rate has only been calculated since 1972, and at 6.5 percent, it's much higher than the 4 percent overall jobless rate. Trump on the campaign trail called the unemployment rate phony, so these claims are flip-flops.\par \par \uc2 In fact, a new poll came out last week: We were up \u8212\'20\'14 in like a week \u8212\'20\'14 10 points with the Hispanic community.\par \par \uc2 Accurate. One poll found that Trump's approval among Hispanics had increased 10 percent after he signed an executive order to end family separations at the border. The poll was an online survey of registered voters, and the margin of error was not disclosed.\par \par \uc2 Unemployment among women is at the lowest level it's been in 65 years.\par \par \uc2 Mostly accurate. The unemployment rate for women as of April was the lowest since 1953. But it ticked up in June and is now the lowest in 18 years.\par \par \uc2 Since the election, we have lifted 3 million people off of food stamps.\par \par \uc2 Mostly accurate. Data show that 3 million fewer people collect food stamps since the 2016 election, but this trend began before Trump took office. Experts say the decline is not just the result of a stronger economy. Several states have rolled back recession-era waivers that allowed some adults to keep benefits for longer periods of time without unemployment. Reports have also suggested immigrant families with citizen children have dropped out for fear of the administration's immigration policies.\par \par \uc2 Wages, for the first time in 18 years, are rising again.\par \par \uc2 False. Wages have been rising since 2014.\par \par \uc2 And six months ago, Republicans passed the biggest tax cuts in American history, the biggest in American history.\par \par \uc2 False. Trump's tax cut is nearly 0.9 percent of GDP, much smaller than Reagan's tax cut in 1981, which was 2.89 percent of GDP. Trump's tax cut is the eighth largest since 1918 \u8212\'20\'14 smaller than two tax cuts passed under Obama.\par \par \uc2 We slashed taxes for working families and saved our family farms. We saved family farms.\par \par \uc2 False. This is an enormous stretch.\par \par \uc2 As a result of our tax cuts, $300 billion poured back into the United States just in the first quarter of this year alone. \u8230\'20\'26 I think the number's going to be $5 trillion, but $350 billion has already come back. Apple computer is spending $350 billion on new campuses, on new facilities. They're bringing back $350 billion. They're going to actually have \u8212\'20\'14 probably, subject to the tax code, about $230 billion come back.\par \par \uc2 Misleading. Apple announced a five-year investment plan in January that adds up to $350 billion, but some of this investment would have happened with or without Trump's tax cut. The tech giant appears to be repatriating $252 billion, not $350 billion or $230 billion, in offshore profit under a provision of Trump's tax legislation.\par \par \uc2 Ninety-five percent of U.S. manufacturers are optimistic about the future. That's the highest number ever.\par \par \uc2 Misleading. Trump is citing the \uc2 National Association of Manufacturers\uc2 , a trade group that has been surveying members for 20 years. In the latest survey, released in June, medium and large manufacturers' confidence had increased to 20-year highs but small manufacturers' confidence had decreased.\u160\'00\'A0This survey, however, is not representative of all manufacturers. NAM members make up 6 percent of manufacturing firms. This is a very low level of coverage for a survey of this kind.\u160\'00\'A0The trade group declined to say whether its members are surveyed randomly.\par \par \uc2 We are allowing businesses to join forces to buy better health care for less money through association health plans. \u8230\'20\'26 Millions of people are already signing up.\par \par \uc2 Mostly false. Trump's Labor Department has adopted a new rule to allow small businesses to band together to buy health-care plans as long as they share a "common geography or industry." The \uc2 Congressional Budget Office\uc2  estimates that millions of people may switch over to these health plans, but there's no evidence "millions of people are already signing up."\par \par \uc2 After decades of waiting, we opened ANWR in Alaska for energy development.\par \par \uc2 Accurate.\par \par \uc2 We've eliminated record numbers of job-killing regulations.\par \par \uc2 Unsupported. There are no reliable data to judge this claim.\par \par \uc2 We approved the Keystone and the Dakota Access pipelines right away, 48,000 jobs \u8212\'20\'14 48,000 jobs.\par \par \uc2 False. Only 90 of these jobs would be permanent, according to estimates from the State Department and the \uc2 Brookings Institution\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 We withdrew from the job-killing Paris Climate accord. \u8230\'20\'26 It's horrible for us \u8212\'20\'14 great for other countries, but horrible for us.\par \par \uc2 Misleading. Each country sets its own commitments under the Paris accord, so Trump's comment is puzzling. He could unilaterally change the commitments offered by Obama, which is technically allowed under the accord. Plus, as we've noted before, Trump ignores any possible benefits that could come from tackling climate change, including potential green jobs.\par \par \uc2 We took historic action \u8230\'20\'26 confirming a record number of circuit court judges.\par \par \uc2 Accurate.\u160\'00\'A0The Senate has confirmed nominees for the U.S. Court of Appeals at a record pace, with 21 judges seated in the year and a half Trump has been in office.\par \par \uc2 Our allies in many cases were worse than our enemies. We opened our country to their goods but they put up massive barriers to keep our products and our goods the hell out of their country because they didn't want that competition. \u8230\'20\'26 We have trade deficits. They have surpluses.\par \par \uc2 False. It's not hard to find countries that the United States has a trade surplus with, including close allies such as Canada.\par \par \uc2 You saw with China, $50 billion and another $200 billion, frankly, is waiting.\par \par \uc2 Accurate. Trump has set $50 billion worth of tariffs on Chinese goods and has asked the U.S. Trade Representative to find $200 billion more.\par \par \uc2 I respect China \u8230\'20\'26 but they've been killing us: $507 billion dollars in trade deficits last year.\par \par \uc2 False. The goods trade deficit with China was $375.6 billion in 2017, a figure that will probably be lower when trade in services is factored into the equation. Moreover, countries do not lose money on trade deficits. A deficit simply means that U.S. consumers bought more Chinese products than vice-versa.\par \par \uc2 Do you know that if we knocked down the trade deficit, right, the trade deficit, by just a little bit, 25 percent \u8212\'20\'14 we can do that easily. If we do that, we pick up one point in GDP? That's $3 trillion and that's 10 million jobs. That's just 25 percent. We pick up one point.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Misleading. Trump makes this sound like a done deal. Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the \uc2 Center on Budget and Policy Priorities\uc2 , disputed Trump's idea that cutting the trade deficit by a quarter is "easy," noting, "Most economists believe that the trade war cuts both imports and exports, so it's unlikely to change the trade deficit much." Plus, with some quick back-of-the-napkin math, Bernstein demonstrated cutting the trade deficit \u8212\'20\'14 which is 3 percent of GDP or $600 billion \u8212\'20\'14 by 25 percent equals $150 billion not $3 trillion. "As far as jobs," he told the Fact Checker using a common rule of thumb (Okun's rule), "A 25 percent decline in the trade deficit would amount to three-quarters a point of GDP or about a 0.4 percentage decrease in the unemployment rate" or 650,000 jobs \u8212\'20\'14 not 10 million.\par \par \uc2 Speaking of GDP, remember when I'd say it's going to go to 3 percent pretty quickly and all of this? Well now, the \uc2 Atlanta Fed\uc2  just predicted 4.8 percent.\par \par \uc2 Mostly false. GDP grew 2.3 percent in 2017, Trump's first year in office. It grew 2 percent during the first quarter of 2018. Trump is referencing an unofficial GDP growth forecast from the \uc2 Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\uc2 . This projection changes every few days and was most recently at 3.8 percent for the second quarter.\par \par \uc2 And every time I meet a leader of another country, which is often, they always start by saying, "Sir, I'd like to congratulate you on the incredible job you've done with the United States economy: Japan, South Korea."\par \par \uc2 Unsupported. Foreign leaders have not said this publicly, and there's no evidence they've said it in private.\par \par \uc2 Since the election, we've created in wealth, $7 trillion.\par \par \uc2 Misleading. This appears to be based on the performance of the Russell 3000 Index since Trump's inauguration. This index includes nearly 98 percent of U.S. stocks, but the market capitalization of the top U.S. companies is not a good indicator of wealth gains for the general population.\par \par \uc2 We're the fastest growing nation on an economy basis \u8212\'20\'14 maybe it's for the big nations but I heard "nation." We're the fastest growing economically nation in the world.\par \par \uc2 False. U.S. GDP growth is not the fastest among large nations, according to the \uc2 World Bank\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 We're taking care of our vets more than anybody's ever taken care of our vets.\par \par \uc2 False. Trump's legislation on veterans builds on what was passed during the Obama administration. The GI bill of 1944 was a much more significant piece of legislation.\par \par \uc2 America's being respected again all over the world. It's been a long time.\par \par \uc2 False. Polls by Gallup and the Pew Global Attitudes Project show worldwide views of the United States and its president have become more negative since Trump took office. The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2  and others have reported that world leaders and allied nations often are baffled or upset by Trump's moves and pronouncements.\par \par \uc2 We have people flooding our borders like they haven't flooded ever before. They're doing an incredible job, but we've never had a rush like this. That's because people want a piece of our action. They want to come into our economy.\par \par \uc2 False. The U.S. Border Patrol apprehended significantly more people along the southern border in 2014, when immigration from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras began to boom. Most of these migrants say they're journeying to the United States to escape gang violence and crime, not for economic reasons.\par \par \uc2 All of \u160\'00\'A0that money \u160\'00\'A0that we've secured for our military, all of that I've directed the Pentagon to begin a process of creating a sixth branch of the United States Armed Forces called the Space Force.\par \par \uc2 Mostly false. Trump has ordered the creation of a space force. But Congress has not authorized any funding \u8212\'20\'14 from the $700 billion in the omnibus spending bill or otherwise \u8212\'20\'14 for this new military branch.\par \par \uc2 We passed a landmark VA accountability law that everybody said could not be passed. \u8230\'20\'26 Everyone said it couldn't be passed, has not been able to be passed for 45 years, and we just got it passed, VA accountability. So now you can fire people when they don't do a job.\par \par \uc2 Misleading. The \uc2 Department of Veterans Affairs\uc2  Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act of 2017 builds on the firing authority given to the VA secretary through the Choice, Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014, which was enacted in response to the 2014 Phoenix VA scandal.\par \par \uc2 And the other thing we just passed a few weeks ago, and you've heard me talk about this, I've always said, "You know, our greatest people, they're the greatest people, the vets." They've protected us. Some of them have suffered greatly. And we weren't taking proper care of them. They were waiting in line for 12 days. \u8230\'20\'26 Even if you have, like, a bad cold, you have something, people were going in with nothing much, and they were coming out six months later. They can't see a doctor. They were coming out with a terminal illness that could've been corrected easily. And I said, why are we sending people who can wait for these long periods? Just send them across the street to a local doctor. Get taken care of, and we pay the bill. And everybody said, "We've been trying to get that passed for 40 years." I got it passed three weeks ago.\par \par \uc2 False.\u160\'00\'A0Despite Trump's claims, veterans are still facing long wait times. A 2018 report by the \uc2 Government Accountability Office\uc2  found that veterans referred to Trump's "choice" program "could potentially wait up to 70 calendar days" to be seen by a doctor, which is not consistent with the requirement that they receive care within 30 days. On average, the study found veterans using the choice program wait 64 days.\par \par \uc2 Remember [at the United Nations] when we had two votes on something having to do with Israel. I said, "We're watching. With all the aid we give all these countries, we're watching." We ended up getting 68 votes.\par \par \uc2 False. The \uc2 U.N. General Assembly\uc2  voted 128 to 9 to demand the United States rescind its recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Together, the abstentions, no votes and absences equaled 65, not 68. Only nine of these were votes.\par \par \uc2 Because they're ripping us, they're taking our money, they don't even vote for us because they didn't respect our country, but now they respect them a lot more. And in many cases, they're not getting that money anymore, too. We stopped it.\par \par \uc2 Misleading.\u160\'00\'A0A 2010 study from \uc2 the conservative Heritage Foundation\uc2  found that countries that received foreign aid historically did not always vote with the United States. But other studies show there is at least a casual relationship between aid and votes. The final breakdown of countries that receive aid in fiscal 2018 is still pending, so it's not clear if the Trump administration has "stopped it," but aid programs were cut by 4.2 percent for fiscal 2018 over 2017.\par \par \uc2 Hey, how about the \uc2 NFL\uc2 ? \u8230\'20\'26 I don't want to cause controversy, but how about they passed this stupid thing. You don't have to do this anymore. If you don't respect the flag or if you don't like the country or whatever it is, just go into the locker room. Just go into the locker room. \u8230\'20\'26 So okay, the anthem's getting ready to play, they run into the locker room, then they come back out.\par \par \uc2 Misleading. Trump says \uc2 NFL\uc2  players would be leaving the field during the national anthem if they opted to protest. The \uc2 NFL\uc2  policy actually says players may stay in their locker room, meaning they wouldn't take the field at all before the anthem plays. Some teams have announced they will not fine players or coaches for kneeling on the sidelines during the anthem despite the \uc2 NFL\uc2 's new policy.\par \par \uc2 This commissioner [\uc2 Roger Goodell\uc2 ], where this guy comes from I have no \u8212\'20\'14 they're paying him $40 million a year.\par \par \uc2 Misleading.\u160\'00\'A0Goodell, the NFL commissioner, signed a contract extension in late 2017 worth $200 million over five years if \u8212\'20\'14 and this is a big if \u8212\'20\'14\u160\'00\'A0all incentives are met and bonuses are granted. Goodell's base salary reportedly is less than $10 million annually. Plus, over several previous seasons, the commissioner's salary was cut repeatedly.\par \par \uc2 [\uc2 NFL\uc2  ratings are] down 20 percent since this whole thing started with the flag and the anthem.\par \par \uc2 False. Trump started commenting on \uc2 NFL\uc2  players kneeling in the fall of 2017. Colin Kaepernick, the NFL quarterback who first knelt during the anthem, began protesting in 2016. Ratings fell 9 percent in 2017 and 17 percent since 2016, according to Nielsen. But that roughly tracks with an overall decline in TV viewership and experts say that the protests were not the primary reason the ratings declined.\par \par \uc2 \u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 (About our rating scale)\par \par \uc2 \u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Send us facts to check by filling out this form\par \par \uc2 Keep tabs on Trump's promises with our Trump Promise Tracker\par \par \uc2 Sign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletter\par \par \uc2 \u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020180710ee7a00209\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 right-turn\par {\*\bkmkstart toc62}{\*\bkmkend toc62}\b \uc2 Trump is losing the country on immigration \b0\par\par\uc2 By Jennifer Rubin \par \uc2 1,223 \uc2 words\par \uc2 29 June 2018\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2018, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The latest \uc2 Pew Research Center\uc2  poll finds:\par \par \uc2 The survey by \uc2 Pew Research Center\uc2 , conducted June 5-12 among 2,002 adults, finds that 38% say legal immigration into the United States should be kept at its present level, while 32% say it should be increased and 24% say it should be decreased.\par \par \uc2 Since 2001, the share of Americans who favor increased legal immigration into the U.S. has risen 22 percentage points (from 10% to 32%), while the share who support a decrease has declined 29 points (from 53% to 24%).\par \par \uc2 That's bad news for the anti-immigrant crowd, who have made clear that their goal is not merely to round up and deport all illegal immigrants but also to severely cut the number of legal immigrants. That's the aim of the Raise Act, co-sponsored by Sens. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) and \uc2 David Perdue\uc2  (R-Ga.) and touted by President Trump.\par \par \uc2 While Democrats have become more enthusiastic about legal immigration, so have Republicans, albeit to a smaller extent. "The share of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents who say legal immigration into the U.S. should be increased has doubled since 2006, from 20% to 40%. . . . The share of Republicans and Republican leaners who say legal immigration should be decreased has fallen 10 percentage points since 2006, from 43% to 33%." However, 33 percent of Republicans vs. 16 percent of Democrats favor reducing legal immigration.\par \par \uc2 This is remarkable, given the stunning ignorance about the relative number of illegal and legal immigrants. ("Just 45% of Americans say that most immigrants living in the U.S. are here legally; 35% say most immigrants are in the country illegally, while 6% volunteer that about half are here legally and half illegally and 13% say they don't know. In 2015, the most recent year for which data are available,\u160\'00\'A0lawful immigrants accounted for about three-quarters of the foreign-born population in the United States.") Still, 69 percent are somewhat or very sympathetic toward illegal immigrants, while just "27% of Americans say that giving people who are in the U.S. illegally a way to gain legal status is like rewarding them for doing something wrong. More than twice as many (67%) say they don't think of it this way. Since 2015, the share saying that providing legal status for those in the U.S. illegally is akin to a 'reward' for doing something wrong has declined 9 percentage points."\par \par \uc2 Despite Trump's persistent lying, most Americans "know\u160\'00\'A0documented immigrants living in the U.S. are not more likely than U.S. citizens to commit serious crimes (65% say this) and that undocumented immigrants mostly fill jobs citizens don't want (71% say this)." That's somewhat reassuring after two years of nonstop anti-immigrant harangues.\par \par \uc2 Even Republicans have not been entirely won over by Trump's nonstop slurs against immigrants \u8212\'20\'14 48 percent feel sympathetic toward illegal immigrants, while 49 percent do not. Even with their supposedly tried-and-true mantra of "No amnesty!," anti-immigrant voices haven't won over a majority of Republicans (46 percent think legalization is a reward, while 47 percent do not).\par \par \uc2 One area in which nervous politicians and pundits sympathetic to immigration have given ground to opponents is on the use of English. Well, ordinary Americans just don't like hearing all that Spanish.\u160\'00\'A0Perhaps pro-immigrant voices should reassess their eagerness to indulge xenophobes. "Most Americans say they often (47%) or sometimes (27%) come into contact with immigrants who speak little or no English. Among those who say this, just 26% say it bothers them, while 73% say it does not. The share saying they are bothered by immigrants speaking little or no English has declined by 12 percentage points since 2006 (from 38% to 26%) and 19 points since 1993 (from 45%)."\par \par \uc2 Let me offer some informed speculation as to why the outlook of most Americans so strongly differs from Trump's and Trump's base and why Americans as a whole are becoming more sympathetic toward immigrants. Many of Trump's red-state supporters, as I have observed, come from states with a minuscule number of illegal immigrants. They've decided that these people are dangerous and are out to steal their jobs, based on very little firsthand experience. In 2016, Pew found that in states such as Kansas and South Carolina, the number of illegal immigrants was quite small and shrinking\u160\'00\'A0(95,o00 in 2009 to 75,000 in 2009 in Kansas, out of a population of nearly 3 million; 100,000 to 85,0000 in South Carolina, out of a population of more than\u160\'00\'A04.8 million.) In Attorney General Jeff Sessions's home state of Alabama, the number went from 80,000 to 65,000 \u8212\'20\'14 out of more than\u160\'00\'A04 million people. In short, much but not all of the staunch opposition to both legal and illegal immigration comes from less-populated, rural states with few immigrants.\par \par \uc2 By contrast, in states with huge \uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2  populations, which have become part of the fabric of society (California, New York, New Jersey, Illinois), the attitude toward immigrants is positive, and becoming more so as more Americans interact, work and live with immigrants \u8212\'20\'14 and intermarry as well. Even in Texas,\u160\'00\'A0where Republican politicians remain obsessed with deportation, "Three-fifths of the registered voters surveyed in the poll said they would continue the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program. Just 30 percent said the program should end." (You may recall that\u160\'00\'A0Republicans along the border\u160\'00\'A0 disfavored the wall.)\par \par \uc2 In sum, the country's overall view of immigrants and even illegal immigrants is improving since a high percentage of Americans live in heavily populated states with large numbers of immigrants (both legal and illegal). As a percentage of the population (and thereby reflected in the polls). more people are having experience with more and more immigrants; it has changed their view of these Americans.\par \par \uc2 Trump's base and the GOP is disproportionately rural and therefore comes in contact far less frequently with actual immigrants. They're content to blame immigrants \u8212\'20\'14 or are riled up to do so by Trump \u8212\'20\'14 for social and economic woes that may have in reality virtually nothing to do with immigrants. The population in these states is declining, and with that the number of rabid anti-immigrant voters, although their intensity is soaring.\par \par \uc2 That's an educated guess as to what is going on. It does not solve the political problem and stalemate, however. Thanks to gerrymandering and two senators for each of those small red states, anti-immigrant voters have disproportionate influence in relation to their overall share of the population; within the GOP, it may be the dominant voice.\par \par \uc2 The solution? Voters who see the United States as a culturally diverse and tolerant country need to get out and vote. If they did and if they pushed for more equitable districting, they would have the upper hand in the political debate. As on guns, the side that feels the most passionate, even if it has a minority of the voters, can exercise huge power. The question is whether pro-immigrant Americans care enough to vote and have their views reflected in Congress and the White House.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020180629ee6t0040h\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

Wootson Jr. \par \uc2 973 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 June 2018\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2018, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Several U.S.-based airlines asked the federal government Wednesday to refrain from using their planes to transport\u160\'00\'A0migrant children separated from their families, saying the controversial Trump administration practice does not align with their values.\par \par \uc2 The announcements by American, United and Frontier airlines came amid reports that the president would sign an executive order ending family separations at the U.S.-Mexico border, with more airlines later following suit.\par \par \uc2 The companies' attempts to distance themselves from the controversial policy prompted a sharp rebuke from Tyler Houlton, a Department of Homeland Security spokesman, who\u160\'00\'A0accused the\u160\'00\'A0corporations of "Buckling to a false media narrative" on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  .\par \par \uc2 It's unfortunate that @AmericanAir, @united, and @FlyFrontierno longer want to partner with the brave men and women of DHS to protect the traveling public, combat human trafficking, and to swiftly reunite unaccompanied \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  children with their families.\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 Tyler Q. Houlton (@SpoxDHS) June 20, 2018\par \par \uc2 In a statement, United chief executive \uc2 Oscar Munoz\uc2  said\u160\'00\'A0the company was "concerned about reports that commercial airlines have been used to transport immigrant children from their parents."\par \par \uc2 United asks \uc2 U.S. government\uc2  not to fly separated immigrant children on our aircraft. pic.twitter.com/MPPbhO6aqV\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 \uc2 United Airlines\uc2  (@united) June 20, 2018\par \par \uc2 In a news release, American said that "We have no desire to be associated with separating families, or worse, to profit from it,"\u160\'00\'A0adding that\u160\'00\'A0it\u160\'00\'A0had carried refugees for nonprofits and for the government, most often for the purpose of reuniting them with family members.\par \par \uc2 Frontier released a similar statement Wednesday afternoon.\par \par \uc2 Frontier prides itself on being a family airline and we will not knowingly allow our flights to be used to transport migrant children away from their families. At this time, we are not aware if Frontier has been used for this purpose.\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 \uc2 Frontier Airlines\uc2  (@FlyFrontier) June 20, 2018\par \par \uc2 The three airlines all said they do not think their planes have been used to transport migrant children who had recently been separated from their parents.\par \par \uc2 More than 2,300 children have been separated from their parents as a direct result of the decision to criminally charge people caught crossing the border illegally.\par \par \uc2 The practice has drawn criticism from political and religious leaders, including conservatives such as former first lady \uc2 Laura Bush\uc2 \u160\'00\'A0and Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.).\par \par \uc2 On Wednesday afternoon, Trump abruptly\u160\'00\'A0signed an\u160\'00\'A0executive order that\u160\'00\'A0administration officials said would keep families together in federal custody while awaiting prosecution for illegal border crossings. In a statement, Delta praised the order and called reports of families being separated "disheartening."\u160\'00\'A0\uc2 Southwest Airlines\uc2  said the company did not "wish to have any involvement in the process of separating children from their parents" and does not have "evidence that tickets purchased for Southwest flights have been utilized to transport detained children."\par \par \uc2 But animus toward the practice has been growing in the airline industry, particularly with workers who say they don't want to help implement a government policy they find morally wrong.\par \par \uc2 In an editorial for the Houston Chronicle,\u160\'00\'A0flight attendant Hunt Palmquist said he had worked two flights during which \uc2 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2  agents were flying migrant children\u160\'00\'A0as young as 4 to a "relocation" site.\par \par \uc2 He did not reveal which airline he worked for in the editorial or in a \uc2 Facebook\uc2  post, but he said the incidents had remained with him.\par \par \uc2 "Since working the two flights, the images of those helpless children have burned into my psyche," he wrote.\u160\'00\'A0"The little children whose faces were full of fear, confusion, sadness and exhaustion left me somewhat traumatized as it occurred to me a few weeks later that I might as well have been a collaborator in their transport.\par \par \uc2 " .\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09. I will no longer be complicit and will walk away from any future flight assignments that try to make me a pawn for this disgusting and deplorable cause."\par \par \uc2 The Arizona Republic reported that the flight was\u160\'00\'A0probably operated by \uc2 American Airlines\uc2  , although a company spokeswoman told the publication that the airline doesn't disclose passenger manifests.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2  could not independently confirm the details of Palmquist's account.\par \par \uc2 The airlines were not the first companies to speak out against the separation of families at the border. Apple chief executive \uc2 Tim Cook\uc2  said\u160\'00\'A0in Dublin on Tuesday that "what's happening is inhumane; it needs to stop."\u160\'00\'A0The heads of\u160\'00\'A0Uber, \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and \uc2 Google\uc2  have also weighed in, while\u160\'00\'A0\uc2 Facebook\uc2  's \uc2 Mark Zuckerberg\uc2  has encouraged people to donate\u160\'00\'A0to a\u160\'00\'A0legal aid organization.\par \par \uc2 Some businesses have been caught up in the heightened immigration crackdown.\par \par \uc2 Microsoft\uc2  faced\u160\'00\'A0outrage\u160\'00\'A0online recently for a\u160\'00\'A0January blog\u160\'00\'A0post saying that the company was "proud\u160\'00\'A0to support" ICE's IT. The company published a\u160\'00\'A0statement\u160\'00\'A0Monday that\u160\'00\'A0"\uc2 Microsoft\uc2  is not working with \uc2 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2  or \uc2 U.S. Customs and Border Protection\uc2  on any projects related to separating children from their families at the border."\par \par \uc2 The American Civil Liberties Union\uc2  and members of Congress have also called on private bus line Greyhound to stop letting Border Patrol agents conduct raids on board. A company spokeswoman, Lanesha Gipson, said Greyhound doesn't "support or coordinate these searches, nor are we happy about them,"\u160\'00\'A0adding that Greyhound is simply complying with the law.\par \par \uc2 Jena McGregor contributed to this report.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Read more:\par \par \uc2 \u160\'00\'A0An airline tried to get a musician to check her 17th-century violin.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 President Trump has caved under massive pressure and issued an executive order that will allow for the detention of migrant children with their parents instead of separating families. One of the key moments in pressuring Trump to act came when the usually nonpolitical former first lady, \uc2 Laura Bush\uc2 ,\u160\'00\'A0wrote an editorial condemning the Trump administration's policy. Bush not only rose above party lines and offered a compassionate argument about human rights, she also unwittingly tapped into a covert way of mobilizing activists that began over a century-and-a-half ago.\par \par \uc2 Bush did not use the terms "\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 " or even "refugee" in her article; instead, she wrote about "children" and "parents." In so doing, she shifted the hotly polemical debates surrounding immigration into the disarming, utterly familiar language of the family. Former first lady \uc2 Michelle Obama\uc2  responded to Bush's article by tweeting, "Sometimes truth transcends party."\par \par \uc2 That former first ladies, rather than former presidents, are speaking out matters. Their language, as well as their formal positions as wives and mothers, draw upon a strategy that has been in use since before the Civil War: women using their maternal roles to make the moral case against policies that separate families.\par \par \uc2 Some leading women writers deployed this strategy in the decade before the Civil War. In their efforts to end slavery, abolitionists in the 1850s described children being ripped apart from their mothers, an act so immoral that it moved previously disengaged people to take a stand against slavery.\par \par \uc2 In the antebellum period, abolitionists' main opponents were not proslavery advocates but, instead, apathetic Northerners. They understood that the real barrier to ending slavery was not just a handful of policymakers and pundits but the millions of Americans who could easily ignore the issue.\par \par \uc2 Harriet Beecher Stowe, author of "Uncle Tom's Cabin," attempted to stir Northern women's emotions by creating a character, Eliza, who risked having her child torn from her side \u8212\'20\'14 a choice that exposed slavery as a violation of motherhood.\par \par \uc2 The story was a heart-wrenching one. In the novel, Eliza overhears her master's plan to sell her son, Harry, to a faraway plantation.\u160\'00\'A0 To avoid losing her child, Eliza escapes with her son in the middle of the night. When her owner discovers she is missing, he gives chase with a team of men and bloodhounds. They eventually discover her near the banks of the frozen Ohio River \u8212\'20\'14 the physical divide between slavery and freedom. Unwilling to be separated from her son, she leaps onto floating cakes of ice, becomes dizzy and slips. The men scream after her. As Stowe described, "her stockings cut from her feet \u8212\'20\'14 while blood marked every step; but she saw nothing, felt nothing, till dimly, as in a dream, she saw the Ohio side."\par \par \uc2 Eliza and her son eventually make it to freedom.\par \par \uc2 During an era when the proslavery press painted a picture of enslaved women as monstrous, promiscuous and incapable of genuine human thought and emotion, Stowe presented Eliza as a mother who, in a powerful act of heroic love, fought her way across a frozen river to remain with her child.\par \par \uc2 The separation of mother and child became a recurring theme in abolitionist books. In her 1861 autobiography "Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl," Harriet Jacobs, a fugitive slave who escaped to the North and wrote under the pseudonym Linda Brent, described her separation from her children. Throughout the book, she addressed her Northern women readers, explaining how New Year's Day "comes laden with peculiar sorrows" for slave mothers, because it is the day when slaves were hired out to other masters. Jacobs described the restless nights before the hiring out, when the enslaved mother "sits on her cold cabin floor, watching the children who may be torn from her the next morning; and often she does wish that she and they might die before the day dawns."\par \par \uc2 These stories of mothers and children being separated, woven through many books of the era, spurred women across the North to become politically engaged. Though not yet enfranchised, these white women joined the abolitionist movement in record numbers. They created groups like the Rochester Ladies Anti-Slavery Society before the war and continued to support black mothers after the war by establishing a number of Freedmen's Aid Societies.\par \par \uc2 Women became the foot soldiers of one of the largest protest movements in the 19th century because of the ways in which the bonds of motherhood exposed the evil of slavery. These stories transformed the political, legal and economic details of the institution of slavery into a familiar language of the family. They also revealed the humanity of slaves and put an end to the longtime proslavery argument that enslavement benefited people of African descent.\par \par \uc2 Family remained a deeply politicized topic long after slavery ended. From debates over the role that the dissolution of the black family played in producing poverty, to the ideal of a nuclear family residing in idyllic suburbs, to the rise of "family values" in conservative politics, the family remained one of the central political issues throughout the 20th century and into the 21st. Oftentimes, it was female activists driving the debates.\par \par \uc2 Yet women activists have been most persuasive when they avoid using the language of the family as a political tool and instead show how policies damage or separate families. Long before \uc2 Laura Bush\uc2  arrived in the White House and later used her platform as a former first lady to condemn children being separated from their parents, white and black women abolitionists first put pen to paper to ensure "No Child Left Behind."\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020180620ee6k006k7\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

Wootson Jr. \par \uc2 848 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 June 2018\par \uc2 The Washington Post\par \uc2 WP\par \uc2 FINAL\par A08\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2018, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved \par \par \uc2 U.S. airlines asked the federal government Wednesday to refrain from using their planes to transport migrant children separated from their families, saying the controversial Trump administration practice does not align with their values.\par \par \uc2 The announcements by American, United, Delta, Southwest and Frontier airlines came amid reports that President Trump would sign an executive order ending family separations at the U.S.-Mexico border, and also prompted a sharp rebuke from Tyler Houlton, a Department of Homeland Security spokesman, who accused the companies of "Buckling to a false media narrative" on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  ."It's unfortunate that @AmericanAir, @united, and @FlyFrontier no longer want to partner with the brave men and women of DHS to protect the traveling public, combat human trafficking, and to swiftly reunite unaccompanied \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  children with their families," Houlton tweeted.\par \par \uc2 His tweet came before Delta and Southwest issued statements decrying the practice.\par \par \uc2 "Delta's mission is to connect people and we are against anything that runs contrary to that mission. Recent reports of families being separated are disheartening and do not align with Delta's core values," the airline tweeted. "We applaud the Administration's Executive Order resolving the issue of separating children from their families at the U.S. border."\par \par \uc2 Said Southwest: "We appeal to anyone making those types of travel decisions not to utilize \uc2 Southwest Airlines\uc2  ."\par \par \uc2 The companies denied that their planes have been used to transport migrant children who had recently been separated from their parents.\par \par \uc2 American said in a statement on its website that "We have no desire to be associated with separating families, or worse, to profit from it," adding that it had carried refugees for nonprofits and for the government, most often for the purpose of reuniting them with family members.\par \par \uc2 United followed suit, tweeting in a statement from chief executive \uc2 Oscar Munoz\uc2  that it had "serious concerns about this policy" and that the company's purpose is "to connect people and unite the world.""United asks \uc2 U.S. government\uc2  not to fly separated immigrant children on our aircraft," the company tweeted.\par \par \uc2 Frontier released a similar statement, saying it "prides itself on being a family airline and we will not knowingly allow our flights to be used to transport migrant children away from their families. At this time, we are not aware if Frontier has been used for this purpose."\par \par \uc2 More than 2,300 children have been separated from their parents as a direct result of the decision to criminally charge people caught crossing the border illegally.\par \par \uc2 Prominent people have criticized the practice, including conservatives such as former first lady \uc2 Laura Bush\uc2  and \uc2 Sen. Ben Sasse\uc2  (R-Neb.).\par \par \uc2 On Wednesday afternoon, Trump abruptly signed an executive order that administration officials said would keep families together in federal custody while awaiting prosecution for illegal border crossings.\par \par \uc2 "We have to be very strong on the border, but at the same time, we want to be very compassionate," Trump said at the White House.\par \par \uc2 Animus toward the practice has been growing in the airline industry, particularly with workers who say they don't want to help implement a government policy they find morally wrong.\par \par \uc2 In an op-ed for the Houston Chronicle, flight attendant Hunt Palmquist said he had worked two flights during which \uc2 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2  agents were flying migrant children as young as 4 to a "relocation" site.\par \par \uc2 He did not reveal which airline he worked for in the editorial or in a \uc2 Facebook\uc2  post, but he said the incidents had remained with him.\par \par \uc2 "Since working the two flights, the images of those helpless children have burned into my psyche," he wrote. "The little children whose faces were full of fear, confusion, sadness and exhaustion left me somewhat traumatized as it occurred to me a few weeks later that I might as well have been a collaborator in their transport.\par \par \uc2 ". . . I will no longer be complicit and will walk away from any future flight assignments that try to make me a pawn for this disgusting and deplorable cause."\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2  's Jena McGregor reported that \uc2 Facebook\uc2  's \uc2 Mark Zuckerberg\uc2  has encouraged people to donate to the Texas Civil Rights Project, which provides legal advice and translation services to migrants affected by the practice and is taking broader legal action.\par \par \uc2 And Apple chief executive \uc2 Tim Cook\uc2  , speaking in Dublin on Tuesday, said "it's heartbreaking to see the images and hear the sounds of the kids. Kids are the most vulnerable people in any society. I think that what's happening is inhumane; it needs to stop."\par \par \uc2 Greyhound also has been caught up in the heightened immigration crackdown, with \uc2 the American Civil Liberties Union\uc2  and members of Congress calling on the company to stop letting Border Patrol agents conduct raids on board. Spokeswoman Lanesha Gipson said the company doesn't "support or coordinate these searches, nor are we happy about them," adding that Greyhound is simply complying with the law.\par \par \uc2 cleve.wootson@washpost.com \par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com \par \par \uc2 WP20180621immigrationbiz0621\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020180621ee6l0000k\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Peril comes with taking up a position in today's polemical trenches alongside a man with no convictions. In keeping with President Trump's hard line on immigration, Attorney General Jeff Sessions in April launched a "zero tolerance" policy vis-a-vis "criminal illegal entry." Noted Sessions, "To those who wish to challenge the Trump administration's commitment to public safety, national security, and the rule of law, I warn you: Illegally entering this country will not be rewarded, but will instead be met with the full prosecutorial powers of the Department of Justice."\par \par \uc2 Omitted from the Justice Department announcement was its core ugliness. The spike in prosecutions, as it turns, out would necessitate the separation of children and parents at the border, with about 2,000 kids so yanked between April 19 and the end of May. Once the backlash surged, so did the gaslighting. Homeland Security Secretary \uc2 Kirstjen Nielsen\uc2  claimed there was no policy to separate families, that "Congress alone" could fix the matter. White House press secretary \uc2 Sarah Huckabee Sanders\uc2  spoke over and over again about following the law.\par \par \uc2 Which brings us to \uc2 Sean Hannity\uc2 , the Fox News host who appears to seesaw between parroting the White House line and dictating it.\par \par \uc2 Hannity is known as the president's "shadow chief of staff," and a man reaches that\u160\'00\'A0exalted\u160\'00\'A0perch only via skill. Look, for instance, at how Hannity maneuvered through this week's awkward events. When criticism of the family-separation policy was peaking earlier this week, Hannity lashed back at the critics by saying such things as, "As I said earlier, no one likes the idea of separating any child from any parent. But this issue has been in the hands of Congress, and right now, the whole issue can be fixed. Every law can be changed, and if they did their job, it would happen. It is the law." And: "Fix the law."\par \par \uc2 Everyone who had stuck a neck out for the Trump-Sessions act of inhumanity \u8212\'20\'14 i.e., Nielsen, Sanders, Hannity, \uc2 Corey Lewandowski\uc2 , among many others \u8212\'20\'14 found themselves exposed on Wednesday, when Trump signed an executive order that backpedaled. "We're going to have strong \u8212\'20\'14 very strong \u8212\'20\'14 borders, but we are going to keep the families together. I didn't like the sight or the feeling of families being separated," said Trump.\par \par \uc2 While many of the policy's defenders can duck the media spotlight for a few days, Hannity has no such luxury. He hosts a weeknight program on Fox News, and his ratings are the envy of his competition. Accordingly, this man has to find the least intrusive, the most logical-sounding, the most plausibly specious way of disappearing his previous remarks and replacing them with a brand-new defense of the president. That genius was fully engaged on Wednesday night, as Hannity offered these words about the executive order:\par \par \uc2 "And earlier today \u8212\'20\'14 by the way, the president has been saying it all week. The president addressed this important issue, and he signed an executive order undoing their damage and ensuring that \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  families would be kept intact. By the way, not his law, he didn't pass it. Congress did. Another president signed it, but he fixed it."\par \par \uc2 If you're a Hannity viewer, and you missed the Justice Department policy announcement or the hundreds of fact-checking stories on just who caused this crisis, you might suppose that the family-separation policy fell from the scorching skies of the Southwest onto the vast U.S.-Mexico border. And there it sat, awaiting a "fix" from the president.\par \par \uc2 Elsewhere in his rant on the matter, Hannity continued casting the impression that the scandal was purely legislative: "By the way, what \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  signed today, let me be blunt, it'll last five minutes in a courtroom before it's thrown out, but at least gives Congress time to do their job," he said.\par \par \uc2 The contortions showcased on "Hannity" aren't an isolated or accidental phenomenon. They're programmatic, not to mention unconscionable. Earlier this week, the general tenor of Fox News prime-time apologism for Trump's immigration policies caught the attention of Hollywood types working with Fox News's corporate sibling. In response to a tweet highlighting Fox News host Tucker Carlson's argument that people should believe the opposite of what mainstream outlets are reporting, "Family Guy" creator Seth MacFarlane riffed, "In other words, don't think critically, don't consult multiple news sources, and in general, don't use your brain. Just blindly obey Fox News. This is fringe [stuff], and it's business like this that makes me embarrassed to work for this company."\par \par \uc2 Antagonism from members of the Hollywood elite, of course, can only delight people such as Hannity, Carlson and Laura Ingraham, the other main feature in Fox News's prime-time opinion block. In cable news, ratings justify everything, and Fox News opinionators won't imperil their standing with the backbone of the Trump plume. And that particular demographic cares a great deal about immigration, as voter surveys have concluded. Per the Atlantic:\par \par \uc2 Contrary to popular narratives, only a small portion\u8212\'20\'14just 27 percent\u8212\'20\'14of white working-class voters said they favor a policy of identifying and deporting immigrants who are in the country illegally. Among the people who did share this belief, Trump was wildly popular: 87 percent of them supported the president in the 2016 election.\par \par \uc2 We don't know for sure how many of those folks watch Fox News \u8212\'20\'14 probably a great, great number. We do know, however, that Carlson, Hannity and Ingraham fashion their presentations with them in mind. In her remarks this week, Ingraham referred to the facilities holding separated children as "summer camps"; Hannity grasped for any stray talking point to deflect from the president's culpability; Carlson earlier this year shouted down the president when he appeared to go a bit wobbly on immigration \u8212\'20\'14 signals to the Trump White House that if you want to get even more extreme on this policy area, your cheerleaders on cable news remain with you. No one nourishes white cultural anxiety like this crew.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020180621ee6l0058y\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 the-fix\par {\*\bkmkstart toc67}{\*\bkmkend toc67}\b \uc2 Why being accused of 'child abuse' by his fellow Methodists probably means little to Jeff Sessions ; There are enough Christians who support Sessions's views that he can disregard those who don't.\b0\par\par\uc2 By Eugene Scott \par \uc2 871 \uc2 words\par \uc2 20 June 2018\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2018, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 White evangelicals have largely supported the Trump administration's immigration policies. But one group the administration did not overwhelmingly win were white mainline Protestants. And members of one denomination are making it known that they do not support the most recent immigration policy of one of their lay members: Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\par \par \uc2 Nearly 700 members of the United Methodist Church signed a\u160\'00\'A0complaint\u160\'00\'A0protesting the Trump administration's family separation policy announced\u160\'00\'A0and defended by Sessions.\par \par \uc2 Based on 2016 United Methodist Book of Discipline, the members, many of them church leaders, charged Sessions with "child abuse," "immorality," "racial discrimination" and "dissemination of doctrines contrary to the standards of doctrine of the United Methodist Church."\par \par \uc2 The letter was written to the pastors of the two churches where Sessions is active. In Mobile, Ala., he is a member of Ashland Place United Methodist Church, pastored by the Rev. Sterling Boykin. In Arlington, he attends Clarendon United Methodist Church, pastored by the Rev. Tracy Wines.\par \par \uc2 The complaint reads:\par \par \uc2 While other individuals and areas of the federal government are implicated in each of these examples, Mr. Sessions \u8212\'20\'14 as a long-term United Methodist in a tremendously powerful, public position \u8212\'20\'14 is particularly accountable to us, his church. He is ours, and we are his. As his denomination, we have an ethical obligation to speak boldly when one of our members is engaged in causing significant harm in matters contrary to the Discipline on the global stage.\par \par \uc2 Sessions, a conservative member of\u160\'00\'A0the world's largest Methodist denomination, probably disagrees with his fellow church members' position on separating immigrant children from their parents. After other Christians criticized the policy, Sessions, who has taught Sunday school at times,\u160\'00\'A0pointed to the Bible to support his approach.\par \par \uc2 Sessions used scripture to defend the\u160\'00\'A0policy in a speech to law enforcement officers earlier this month:\par \par \uc2 "Persons who violate the law of our nation are subject to prosecution. I would cite you to the Apostle Paul and his clear and wise command in Romans 13 to obey the laws of the government because God has ordained them for the purpose of order. Orderly and lawful processes are good in themselves and protect the weak and lawful."\par \par \uc2 While there are plenty of conservative Christians who support Sessions's interpretation of the Bible, the United Methodist Church is one of the country's most politically diverse. It includes everyone from Sessions to establishment Republican former president \uc2 George W. Bush\uc2  to frequent Sessions critics Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and the former 2016 Democratic nominee \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 , who has pointed to the scriptures to criticize\u160\'00\'A0the Trump administration's policy.\par \par \uc2 Those who selectively use the Bible to justify this cruelty are ignoring a central tenet of Christianity. Jesus said "Suffer the little children unto me." He did not say "let the children suffer."\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  (@HillaryClinton) June 18, 2018\par \par \uc2 But no matter how much theological debate happens between Sessions and his fellow church members, as well as those from outside his religious tribe, the attorney general is not\u160\'00\'A0likely to back down from this policy; it appears that his deeply held conviction is that breaking the laws of immigration deserves punishment. It is more probable Sessions will\u160\'00\'A0link up with those he has found common ground with politically rather than theologically.\par \par \uc2 And he is not the only one.\par \par \uc2 In the current political climate, political tribalism often trumps religious tribalism. It\u160\'00\'A0has been difficult for many people of faith to get on\u160\'00\'A0the same page with other members of their congregations\u160\'00\'A0if they don't share the same politics. It is not yet clear how Sessions responded to the letter from his fellow Methodists, but the likelihood of him changing his mind after getting pushback from individuals he does not know\u160\'00\'A0seems low, considering the affirmation he is getting from Christians\u160\'00\'A0who believe in what he does.\par \par \uc2 Darrell Scott, a pastor and member of Trump's evangelical advisory council, dismissed the\u160\'00\'A0criticism the Trump administration is receiving from the left.\par \par \uc2 Once the mid terms are over, liberals won't talk about detained or separated \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  children until 2020. #itsallpolitics\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 Dr.Darrell Scott (@PastorDScott) June 19, 2018\par \par \uc2 And perhaps the view of another Christian on separating babies from their mothers is the one that matters most to Sessions: President Trump.\par \par \uc2 Sessions has repeatedly been on the receiving end of the president's criticism, with Trump recently saying that he wishes he would have chosen someone other than Sessions\u160\'00\'A0to be\u160\'00\'A0attorney general after\u160\'00\'A0the Justice Department official\u160\'00\'A0recused himself from the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.\par \par \uc2 While Sessions may not have the favor of numerous Methodists right now, he appears to be on Trump's good side on this issue. And that \u8212\'20\'14 combined with the fact that Sessions apparently believes that he is doing what is right in the eyes of God \u8212\'20\'14 is probably more than enough for him to push the concerns of many of his church brethren aside.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020180620ee6k004mq\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 post-partisan\par {\*\bkmkstart toc68}{\*\bkmkend toc68}\b \uc2 Democrats still have no message on the economy or jobs \b0\par\par\uc2 By Ed Rogers \par \uc2 596 \uc2 words\par \uc2 20 June 2018\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2018, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 In a \uc2 New York Times\uc2  column this week, Democratic pollster \uc2 Stanley B. Greenberg\uc2  wrote that President Trump's policies are pushing "ideologically moderate" Republicans away from the GOP.\u160\'00\'A0 According to Greenberg, "The harder the president bangs these drums, the more Democrats become enraged and a segment of Republicans get demoralized. The more he trashes his Republican opponents in primaries, the more these voters may contemplate different political options." That is well said. However, the voters Greenberg describes are not "moderates" in the way he wants them to be, and they are a long way from voting for Democrats.\par \par \uc2 Greenberg\u160\'00\'A0does get a lot right about voter dynamics in the Trump era. The fact is, Trump's actions are met with electric applause in most parts of the Republican Party but with lamenting eye rolls, sighs and gasps in others. There are some Republicans who Greenberg says are teetering on the edge, unsure of how they will vote if they vote at all in November.\u160\'00\'A0They are Republicans whose temperate approach to politics means they find the president's noise off-putting and discouraging, to say the least. They find many of his words and actions to be disagreeable, even if they agree with his core objectives. Most recently, Republicans have objected to separating children from their \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  mothers at the country's southern border while maintaining support for tougher border security and a crackdown on illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 But Greenberg overstates the importance of issues such as abortion and climate change to these voters. Democrats still don't have a compelling message on the issues that many voters care about most \u8212\'20\'14 starting with the economy and jobs. So why would they make the radical departure from a good and growing Republican economy to a Democratic Party whose only purpose is to "resist" the president?\par \par \uc2 Greenberg is a pro. He has been around for a long time. He knows Democrats have no economic message. In a recent op-ed, he warned the Democrats that they will lose their chance to "win landslide victories \u8230\'20\'26 if they don't address the economic challenges confronting their strongest supporters, who are at risk of staying home on election day." Greenberg must know the Democrats' lurch to the left turns off broad swaths of the country, many of whom are independent or marginal Republican voters. Their silence is a gift to Republicans. Not many Republican-leaning voters will want a return to a Democrat-run economy.\par \par \uc2 When Greenberg tried to explain in his \uc2 New York Times\uc2  piece what Republicans turned off by Trump might find appealing about the Democratic Party, all he had were stale platitudes that sounded like classic Hillary-speak. He described swing voters and disaffected Republicans as those who\u160\'00\'A0"might be ready to vote for candidates who respect women, who are angry about the N.R.A. and school shootings, who believe climate change is real and who want a government that works for the middle class at least as hard as it does for the privileged." \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  couldn't have said it better herself. And therein lies the Democrats' problem. They still don't have a message about the economy or jobs.\par \par \uc2 The 2018 midterms are the Democrats' to lose. But they need something that appeals to voters besides the Trump-supplied outrage du jour. If they promise to undo the opportunity and security that comes from a good Republican-produced economy, well, Democrats could squander the opportunity they've been given.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020180620ee6k005k1\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National-Politics\par {\*\bkmkstart toc69}{\*\bkmkend toc69}\b \uc2 President Trump seems to be saying more and more things that aren't true\b0\par\par\uc2 By Ashley Parker \par \uc2 1,279 \uc2 words\par \uc2 20 June 2018\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2018, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 He's done it on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 . He's done it in the White House driveway. And he's done it in a speech to a business group.\par \par \uc2 President Trump\u160\'00\'A0\u8212\'20\'14 a man already known for trafficking in mistruths and even outright lies\u160\'00\'A0\u8212\'20\'14 has been outdoing even himself with falsehoods in recent days, repeating and amplifying bogus claims on several of the most pressing controversies facing his presidency.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 \u160\'00\'A0Since Saturday, Trump has tweeted false or misleading information at least seven times on the topic of immigration and at least six times on a Justice Department inspector general report into the \uc2 FBI\uc2 's handling of its investigation into \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 's private email server. That's more than a dozen obfuscations on just two central topics \u8212\'20\'14 a figure that does not include falsehoods on other issues, whether in tweets or public remarks.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 The false claims come as the president\u160\'00\'A0\u8212\'20\'14 emboldened by fewer disciplinarians inside the West Wing\u160\'00\'A0\u8212\'20\'14 indulges in frequent \uc2 Twitter\uc2  screeds. A \uc2 Washington Post\uc2  analysis found that in June, Trump has been tweeting at the fastest rate of his presidency so far, an average of 11.3 messages per day.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Inside the White House, aides and advisers say they believe the media is unwilling to give Trump a fair shot and is knee-jerk ready to accuse him of lying, even in cases where the facts support his point.\par \par \uc2 The president often seeks to paint a self-serving and self-affirming alternate reality for himself and his supporters. Disparaging the "fake news" media, Trump offers his own filter through which to view the world \u8212\'20\'14 offering a competing reality on issues including relationships forged (or broken) at the \uc2 Group of Seven\uc2  summit in Canada, the success of the Singapore summit with the North Koreans, and his administration's \u160\'00\'A0"zero tolerance" policy on illegal immigration.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 "It's extraordinary how he is completely indifferent to truth. There's just no relationship between his statements \u8212\'20\'14 anything he utters \u8212\'20\'14 and the actual truth of the matter," said \uc2 Thomas Murray\uc2 , president emeritus of \uc2 the Hastings Center\uc2 , the founding institution in the field of bioethics.\u160\'00\'A0"As far as I can tell, the best way to understand anything he says is what will best serve his interests in the moment. It's irrespective to any version of the truth."\par \par \uc2 According to an analysis by The Post's Fact Checker through the end of May, Trump had made 3,251 false or misleading claims in 497 days\u160\'00\'A0\u8212\'20\'14 an average of 6.5 such claims per day of his presidency.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 And within the past week, Trump seems to have ramped up both the volume and the intensity of his false statements on two of the most prominent topics currently facing his administration: the hard-line immigration policy that has led to the separation of thousands of children from their parents \u8212\'20\'14 which Trump erroneously blames on others \u8212\'20\'14 and the 500-page inspector general report that he claims, incorrectly, exonerates him in special counsel \uc2 Robert S. Mueller III\uc2 's probe of Russian interference in the 2016 election.\par \par \uc2 Bella DePaulo, a psychology researcher at the University of California at Santa Barbara, said Trump's use of repetition is a particularly effective technique for convincing his supporters of the veracity of his false claims, in part because most people have a "truth bias," or an initial inclination to accept what others say as true.\par \par \uc2 "When liars repeat the same lie over and over again, they can get even more of an advantage, at least among those who want to believe them or are not all that motivated either way," DePaulo said in an email.\u160\'00\'A0"So when people hear the same lies over and over again \u8212\'20\'14 especially when they want to believe those lies \u8212\'20\'14 a kind of new reality can be created. What they've heard starts to seem like it's just obvious, and not something that needs to be questioned."\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 On immigration, Trump and many top administration officials have said that existing U.S. laws and court rulings have given them no choice but to separate families trying to cross illegally into the United States. But it is the administration's decision, announced in April, to prosecute all southern border crossings that has led to the separation of families.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 That hasn't stopped the president from blaming Democrats for his administration's decisions. "Democrats are the problem," Trump wrote in one tweet. In another, he was even more blunt:\u160\'00\'A0"The Democrats are forcing the breakup of families at the Border with their horrible and cruel legislative agenda," he wrote.\par \par \uc2 While Congress could pass a legislative fix, Republicans control both the House and the Senate \u8212\'20\'14 making it disingenuous at best to finger the opposing party, as the president has repeatedly done.\par \par \uc2 Speaking to the \uc2 National Federation of Independent Business\uc2  on Tuesday, Trump again falsely painted the humanitarian crisis as a binary choice. "We can either release all \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  families and minors who show up at the border from Central America, or we can arrest the adults for the federal crime of illegal entry," he said. "Those are the only two options."\par \par \uc2 On \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , the president twice in the past four days has singled out Germany as facing an increase in crime.\u160\'00\'A0"Crime in Germany is up 10% plus (officials do not want to report these crimes) since migrants were accepted," Trump wrote. "Others countries are even worse. Be smart America!"\par \par \uc2 In fact, the opposite is true. Reported crime in Germany was actually down by 10 percent last year\u160\'00\'A0and, according to German Interior Minister \uc2 Horst Seehofer\uc2 , the country's reported crime rate last year was actually at its lowest point in three decades.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 The president has also falsely claimed that the inspector general report\u160\'00\'A0"exonerated" him from Mueller's probe, when the report did not delve into the Russia investigation. When he made this argument Friday during an impromptu press gaggle in the White House driveway, a reporter pressed him on the falsehood.\par \par \uc2 "Sir, that has nothing to do with collusion," the reporter said. "Why are you lying about it, sir?"\par \par \uc2 Trump's messaging on the family separation issue has faced pushback even from members of his own party, who have publicly and privately urged him to fix the problem. And the discordant noise from members of his administration, who are contradicting him and one another, has further eroded his credibility on the issue.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 On a conference call Tuesday morning, for instance, a senior \uc2 Health and Human Services\uc2  official said the new policy was focused on deterrence and was working\u160\'00\'A0\u8212\'20\'14 contradicting the public comments of Homeland Security Secretary \uc2 Kirstjen Nielsen\uc2 , who has publicly said that family separation is not a policy, is not new and is not about deterrence.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Brian Fallon, a press secretary for \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 's 2016 presidential bid, said he thinks the past week may mark an\u160\'00\'A0"inflection point" in how both the media and the public treat Trump's mistruths.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 "The lies have been so bald and discernibly false, I think people have felt license to challenge him and use the word 'lie' more freely than they have in the past," Fallon said.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 The topic of family separation, Fallon added, is especially stark.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 "I think the sort of visceral nature of this particular issue, in terms of the sympathy that these young kids have evoked, has caused a splintering within his own party," Fallon said. "Once you have a critical mass of defections among your own side,\u160\'00\'A0at that point, it becomes unsustainable even for somebody who has patented this approach to lying like Trump has."\par \par \uc2 ashley.parker@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020180619ee6j007pt\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved \par \par \uc2 He's done it on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 . He's done it in the White House driveway. And he's done it in a speech to a business group.\par \par \uc2 President Trump - a man already known for trafficking in mistruths and even outright lies - has been outdoing even himself with falsehoods in recent days, repeating and amplifying bogus claims on several of the most pressing controversies facing his presidency.\par \par \uc2 Since Saturday, Trump has tweeted false or misleading information at least seven times on the topic of immigration and at least six times on a Justice Department inspector general report into the \uc2 FBI\uc2 's handling of its investigation into \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 's private email server. That's more than a dozen obfuscations on just two central topics - a figure that does not include falsehoods on other issues, whether in tweets or public remarks.\par \par \uc2 The false claims come as the president - emboldened by fewer disciplinarians inside the West Wing - indulges in frequent \uc2 Twitter\uc2  screeds. A \uc2 Washington Post\uc2  analysis found that in June, Trump has been tweeting at the fastest rate of his presidency so far, an average of 11.3 messages per day.\par \par \uc2 Inside the White House, aides and advisers say they believe the media is unwilling to give Trump a fair shot and is knee-jerk ready to accuse him of lying, even in cases where the facts support his point.\par \par \uc2 The president often seeks to paint a self-serving and self-affirming alternate reality for himself and his supporters. Disparaging the "fake news" media, Trump offers his own filter through which to view the world - offering a competing reality on issues including relationships forged (or broken) at the \uc2 Group of Seven\uc2  summit in Canada, the success of the Singapore summit with the North Koreans, and his administration's "zero tolerance" policy on illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 "It's extraordinary how he is completely indifferent to truth. There's just no relationship between his statements - anything he utters - and the actual truth of the matter," said \uc2 Thomas Murray\uc2 , president emeritus of \uc2 the Hastings Center\uc2 , the founding institution in the field of bioethics. "As far as I can tell, the best way to understand anything he says is what will best serve his interests in the moment. It's irrespective to any version of the truth."\par \par \uc2 According to an analysis by The Post's Fact Checker through the end of May, Trump had made 3,251 false or misleading claims in 497 days - an average of 6.5 such claims per day of his presidency.\par \par \uc2 And within the past week, Trump seems to have ramped up both the volume and the intensity of his false statements on two of the most prominent topics currently facing his administration: the hard-line immigration policy that has led to the separation of thousands of children from their parents - which Trump erroneously blames on others - and the 500-page inspector general report that he claims, incorrectly, exonerates him in special counsel \uc2 Robert S. Mueller III\uc2 's probe of Russian interference in the 2016 election.\par \par \uc2 Bella DePaulo, a psychology researcher at the University of California at Santa Barbara, said Trump's use of repetition is a particularly effective technique for convincing his supporters of the veracity of his false claims, in part because most people have a "truth bias," or an initial inclination to accept what others say as true.\par \par \uc2 "When liars repeat the same lie over and over again, they can get even more of an advantage, at least among those who want to believe them or are not all that motivated either way," DePaulo said in an email. "So when people hear the same lies over and over again - especially when they want to believe those lies - a kind of new reality can be created. What they've heard starts to seem like it's just obvious, and not something that needs to be questioned."\par \par \uc2 On immigration, Trump and many top administration officials have said that existing U.S. laws and court rulings have given them no choice but to separate families trying to cross illegally into the United States. But it is the administration's decision, announced in April, to prosecute all southern border crossings that has led to the separation of families.\par \par \uc2 That hasn't stopped the president from blaming Democrats for his administration's decisions. "Democrats are the problem," Trump wrote in one tweet. In another, he was even more blunt: "The Democrats are forcing the breakup of families at the Border with their horrible and cruel legislative agenda," he wrote.\par \par \uc2 While Congress could pass a legislative fix, Republicans control both the House and the Senate - making it disingenuous at best to finger the opposing party, as the president has repeatedly done.\par \par \uc2 Speaking to the \uc2 National Federation of Independent Business\uc2  on Tuesday, Trump again falsely painted the humanitarian crisis as a binary choice. "We can either release all \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  families and minors who show up at the border from Central America, or we can arrest the adults for the federal crime of illegal entry," he said. "Those are the only two options."\par \par \uc2 On \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , the president twice in the past four days has singled out Germany as facing an increase in crime. "Crime in Germany is up 10% plus (officials do not want to report these crimes) since migrants were accepted," Trump wrote. "Others countries are even worse. Be smart America!"\par \par \uc2 In fact, the opposite is true. Reported crime in Germany was actually down by 10 percent last year and, according to German Interior Minister \uc2 Horst Seehofer\uc2 , the country's reported crime rate last year was actually at its lowest point in three decades.\par \par \uc2 The president has also falsely claimed that the inspector general report "exonerated" him from Mueller's probe, when the report did not delve into the Russia investigation. When he made this argument Friday during an impromptu press gaggle in the White House driveway, a reporter pressed him on the falsehood.\par \par \uc2 "Sir, that has nothing to do with collusion," the reporter said. "Why are you lying about it, sir?"\par \par \uc2 Trump's messaging on the family separation issue has faced pushback even from members of his own party, who have publicly and privately urged him to fix the problem. And the discordant noise from members of his administration, who are contradicting him and one another, has further eroded his credibility on the issue.\par \par \uc2 On a conference call Tuesday morning, for instance, a senior \uc2 Health and Human Services\uc2  official said the new policy was focused on deterrence and was working - contradicting the public comments of Homeland Security Secretary \uc2 Kirstjen Nielsen\uc2 , who has publicly said that family separation is not a policy, is not new and is not about deterrence.\par \par \uc2 Brian Fallon, a press secretary for \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 's 2016 presidential bid, said he thinks the past week may mark an "inflection point" in how both the media and the public treat Trump's mistruths.\par \par \uc2 "The lies have been so bald and discernibly false, I think people have felt license to challenge him and use the word 'lie' more freely than they have in the past," Fallon said.\par \par \uc2 The topic of family separation, Fallon added, is especially stark.\par \par \uc2 "I think the sort of visceral nature of this particular issue, in terms of the sympathy that these young kids have evoked, has caused a splintering within his own party," Fallon said. "Once you have a critical mass of defections among your own side, at that point, it becomes unsustainable even for somebody who has patented this approach to lying like Trump has."\par \par \uc2 ashley.parker@washpost.com \par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com\par \par \uc2 WP20180620trumpfalsehoods0620\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020180620ee6k0002w\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Embattled Homeland Security Secretary \uc2 Kirstjen Nielsen\uc2  \u160\'00\'A0on Monday provided the most extensive defense to date of the Trump administration's policy of separating families who immigrated illegally at the border, submitting to questions at the White House press briefing.\par \par \uc2 The briefing included a number of tense exchanges, odd claims and contradictory signals. Below is the full transcript, with our annotations.\par \par \uc2 NIELSEN: Well, good afternoon.\u160\'00\'A0 It is my pleasure to be here because I would love to see if I can help explain some of what's going on and give you some of the facts. I know there have been a lot put out there, but hopefully we can clarify some things today.\par \par \uc2 I just wanted to start by thanking the sheriffs of the United States. I had the privilege of speaking to them this morning at the National Sheriffs' Association Conference. We are so thankful for their partnership at DHS and all they do to protect our community. So I thank them.\par \par \uc2 So I want to provide you an update on the illegal immigration crisis on our southern border and the effects \u8212\'20\'14 the efforts the administration is taking to solve this crisis and to stop the flood of illegal immigrants, drugs, contraband, and crime coming across the border.\par \par \uc2 So let's just start with a few numbers and facts. So in the last three months, we have seen illegal immigration on our southern border exceed 50,000 people each month. Multiples over each month last year.\par \par \uc2 Since this time last year, there has been a 325 percent increase in unaccompanied alien children and a 435 percent increase in family units entering the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 Over the last 10 years, there has been a 1,700 percent increase in asylum claims, resulting in asylum backlog to date, on our country, of 600,000 cases.\par \par \uc2 Since 2013, the United States has admitted more than half a million \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  minors and family units from Central America, most of whom today are at large in the United States. At the same time, large criminal organizations such as MS-13 have violated our borders and gained a deadly foothold within the United States.\par \par \uc2 This entire crisis, just to be clear, is not new. It's been occurring and expanded over many decades. But currently, it is the exclusive product of loopholes in our federal immigration laws that prevent \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  minors and family members from being detained and removed to their home countries.\par \par \uc2 In other words, these loopholes create a functionally open border. Apprehension without detention and removal is not border security. We have repeatedly called on Congress to close these loopholes. I, myself, have met with as many members have been willing to meet with me.\u160\'00\'A0 I've testified seven times. I will continue to make myself available to ask that they work with us to solve this crisis.\par \par \uc2 Yet the voices most loudly criticizing the enforcement of our current laws are those whose policies created this crisis and whose policies perpetrate it.\par \par \uc2 In particular, we need to reform three major loopholes. Let me quickly walk you through them.\u160\'00\'A0 First, we need to amend the 2008 Trafficking Victims Prevention Reauthorization Act, or TVPR \u8212\'20\'14 which is much easier to say. This law encourages families to put children in the hands of smugglers to bring them alone on this dangerous trek northward. And make no mistake, we've talked about this before \u8212\'20\'14 this trek is dangerous and deadly.\par \par \uc2 Second, we need to reform our asylum laws to end the systemic abuse of our asylum system and stop fraud. Right now, our asylum system fails to assist asylum seekers who legitimately need it.\u160\'00\'A0 We are a country of compassion. We are a country of heart. We must fix the system so that those who truly need asylum can, in fact, receive it.\par \par \uc2 Third, we need to amend the Flores Settlement Agreement and recent expansions which currently allow for \u8212\'20\'14 which would allow for family detention during the removal process. And we need Congress to fully fund our ability to hold families together through the immigration process.\par \par \uc2 Until these loopholes are closed by Congress, it is not possible, as a matter of law, to detain and remove whole family units who arrive illegally in the United States.\par \par \uc2 Congress and the courts created this problem, and Congress alone can fix it. Until then, we will enforce every law we have on the books to defend the sovereignty and security of the United States. Those who criticize the enforcement of our laws have offered only one countermeasure: open borders; the quick release of all illegal alien families and the decision not to enforce our laws. This policy would be disastrous. Its prime beneficiaries would be the smuggling organizations themselves, and the prime victims would be the children who would be plunged into the smuggling machines and get gang recruitment on the trip north.\par \par \uc2 There's a lot of misinformation about what DHS is and is not doing as it relates to families at the border and I want to correct the record. Here are the facts:\par \par \uc2 First, this administration did not create a policy of separating families at the border. We have a statutory responsibility that we take seriously to protect alien children from human smuggling, trafficking, and other criminal actions while enforcing our immigration laws.\par \par \uc2 We have a long-existing policy. Multiple administrations have followed that outline when we may take action to protect children. We will separate those who claim to be a parent and child if we cannot determine a familial or custodial relationship exists.\par \par \uc2 For example, if there's no documentation to confirm the claimed relationship between an adult and a child, we do so if the parent is a national security, public or safety risk, including when there are criminal charges at issue and it may not be appropriate to maintain the family in detention together.\par \par \uc2 We also separate a parent and child if the adult is suspected of human trafficking. There have been cases where minors have been used and trafficked by unrelated adults in an effort to avoid detention. And I'd stop here to say, in the last five months, we have a 314 percent increase in adults and children arriving at the border, fraudulently claiming to be a family unit. This is, obviously, of concern.\par \par \uc2 And separation can occur when the parent is charged with human smuggling. Under those circumstances, we would detain the parent in an appropriate secure detention facility separate from the child.\par \par \uc2 What has changed is that we no longer exempt entire classes of people who break the law.\u160\'00\'A0 Everyone is subject to prosecution. When DHS refers a case against a parent or legal guardian for criminal prosecution, the parent or legal guardian will be placed into the \uc2 U.S. Marshals Service\uc2  custody for pretrial determination, pursuant to an order by a federal judge. And any accompanied child will be transferred to the \uc2 Department of Health and Human Services\uc2  and will be reclassified as an unaccompanied alien child. That is in accordance with the TVPRA \u8212\'20\'14 a law that was passed by Congress \u8212\'20\'14 and a following court order, neither which are actions the Trump administration has taken.\par \par \uc2 And let's be clear: If an American were to commit a crime anywhere in the United States, they would go to jail and they would be separated from their family. This is not a controversial idea.\par \par \uc2 Second, children in DHS and \uc2 HHS\uc2  custody are being well taken care of. The Department of Health and Human Services Office of Refugee Resettlement provides meals, medical care, and educational services to these children.\u160\'00\'A0 They are provided temporary shelter.\u160\'00\'A0 And \uc2 HHS\uc2  works hard to find a parent, relative, or foster home to care for these children.\u160\'00\'A0 Parents can still communicate with their children through phone calls and video conferencing.\par \par \uc2 And a parent who is released from custody can be a sponsor and ask \uc2 HHS\uc2  to release the child back into their care.\u160\'00\'A0 Further, these minors can still apply for asylum and other protections under U.S. immigration law, if eligible.\par \par \uc2 We take allegations of mistreatment seriously.\u160\'00\'A0 And I want to stress this point: We investigate.\u160\'00\'A0 We hold those accountable when, and if, it should occur.\u160\'00\'A0 We have some of the highest detention standards in the country.\u160\'00\'A0 Claiming these children and their parents are treated inhumanely is not true and completely disrespects the hard-working men and women at the \uc2 Office of Refugee Resettlement\uc2  .\par \par \uc2 Third, parents who entered illegally are, by definition, criminals.\u160\'00\'A0 Illegal entry is a crime as determined by Congress.\u160\'00\'A0 By entering our country illegally, often in dangerous circumstances, illegal immigrants have put their children at risk.\par \par \uc2 Fourth, CBP and ICE officers are properly trained to care for minors in their custody.\u160\'00\'A0 DHS and \uc2 HHS\uc2  treats all individuals in its custody with dignity and respect, and complies with all laws and policy.\u160\'00\'A0 This reinforces and reiterates the needs to consider the best interest of the children, and mandates adherence to establish protocols to protect at-risk populations, to include standards for the transport and treatment of minors in DHS and \uc2 HHS\uc2  custody.\par \par \uc2 Additionally, all U.S. Border Patrol personnel in the southwest border are bilingual \u8212\'20\'14 every last one of them.\u160\'00\'A0 They are directed to clearly explain the relevant process to apprehended individuals, and provide detainees with written documentation in both Spanish and English that lays out the process and appropriate phone numbers to contact.\par \par \uc2 And finally, DHS is not separating families legitimately seeking asylum at ports of entry.\u160\'00\'A0 If an adult enters at a port of entry and claims asylum, they will not face prosecution for illegal entry.\u160\'00\'A0 They have not committed a crime by coming to the port of entry.\par \par \uc2 As I mentioned, DHS does have a responsibility to protect minors.\u160\'00\'A0 And in that case, as well, we will only separate the family if we cannot determine there is a familiar relationship, if the child may be at risk with the parent or legal guardian, or if the parent or legal guardian is referred for prosecution.\par \par \uc2 We have a duty to protect the American people, and it's one that I take very seriously.\u160\'00\'A0 Here is the bottom line: DHS is no longer ignoring the law.\u160\'00\'A0 We are enforcing the laws as they exist on the books.\u160\'00\'A0 As long as illegal entry remains a criminal offense, DHS will not look the other way.\u160\'00\'A0 DHS will faithfully execute the laws enacted by Congress, as we are sworn to do.\par \par \uc2 As I said earlier today, surely it is the beginning of the unraveling of democracy when the body who makes the laws, instead of changing them, tells the enforcement body not to enforce the law.\u160\'00\'A0 I ask Congress to act this week so that we can secure our borders and uphold our humanitarian ideas.\u160\'00\'A0 These two missions should not be pitted against each other.\u160\'00\'A0 If we close the loopholes, we can accomplish both.\par \par \uc2 Before I take questions, I just want to ask that, in your reporting, please consider the men and women of DHS who are dedicated law enforcement officers and who often put their lives at risk.\u160\'00\'A0 Let's remember their sacrifice and commitment to this country.\par \par \uc2 And with that, I'll take some questions.\u160\'00\'A0 Yes.\par \par \uc2 Q:\u160\'00\'A0Secretary Nielsen, if you could, what you talked about there \u8212\'20\'14 DHS is no longer ignoring the law \u8212\'20\'14 you're calling on Congress to change the law.\par \par \uc2 NIELSEN: Yes.\par \par \uc2 Q:\u160\'00\'A0I mean, that is the big message here.\u160\'00\'A0 Members of Congress on the Democratic side say that you're using children as a lever to try to get them to take legislative action.\u160\'00\'A0 What do you say to that?\par \par \uc2 NIELSEN: I say that is a very cowardly response.\u160\'00\'A0 It's clearly within their power to make the laws and change the laws.\u160\'00\'A0 They should do so.\par \par \uc2 Yes.\par \par \uc2 Q: Have you seen the photos of children in cages?\u160\'00\'A0 Have you heard the audio clip of these children wailing, that just came out today?\par \par \uc2 NIELSEN: I have not seen \u8212\'20\'14 as something that came out today.\u160\'00\'A0 But I have been to detention centers.\u160\'00\'A0 And again, I would reference you to our standards.\u160\'00\'A0 I would reference you to the care provided not just by the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2  but by the \uc2 Department of Health and Human Services\uc2  when they get to \uc2 HHS\uc2  .\par \par \uc2 Q:\u160\'00\'A0But is that the image of this country that you want out there \u8212\'20\'14 children in cages?\par \par \uc2 NIELSEN: The image that I want of this country is an immigration system that secures our borders and upholds our humanitarian ideals.\u160\'00\'A0 Congress needs to fix it.\par \par \uc2 Yes.\par \par \uc2 Q:\u160\'00\'A0Madam Secretary, I'd like to give you a chance to respond to \uc2 Laura Bush\uc2 .\u160\'00\'A0 In an op-ed, she says this is cruel.\u160\'00\'A0 She supports an application of the law.\u160\'00\'A0 Even the current first lady, Melania Trump, has said we should be a nation of laws; we should do so "with heart."\u160\'00\'A0 Do you have anything you want to tell them?\u160\'00\'A0 Do you believe they're misunderstanding the situation?\u160\'00\'A0 Or do you believe there's any component of this policy which, as you've outlined, other administrations have done, but you're using in a way that is more intense and creates this separation issue?\par \par \uc2 NIELSEN: What my response would be is, is calling attention to this matter is important.\u160\'00\'A0 This is a very serious issue that has resulted after years and years of Congress not taking action.\u160\'00\'A0 So I would thank them both for their comments.\u160\'00\'A0 I would thank them both for their concerns.\u160\'00\'A0 I share their concerns.\u160\'00\'A0 But Congress is the one that needs to fix this.\par \par \uc2 Q:\u160\'00\'A0And this policy is not, by your definition, in any way, cruel?\par \par \uc2 NIELSEN: It's not a policy.\u160\'00\'A0 Our policy at DHS is to do what we're sworn to do, which is to enforce the law.\par \par \uc2 Yes.\par \par \uc2 Q:\u160\'00\'A0Following up on Major's question there,\u160\'00\'A0Former first lady \uc2 Laura Bush\uc2  compared this to Japanese internment during World War II \u8212\'20\'14 one of the darkest days in the nation's history.\u160\'00\'A0 Do you believe that the effect of this policy \u8212\'20\'14 so not the law \u8212\'20\'14 but the effect of it on separating children from families in those specific instances is moral, is ethical, is American?\par \par \uc2 NIELSEN: What I believe is that we should exercise our democratic rights as Americans and fix the problem.\u160\'00\'A0 It's a problem; let's fix it.\par \par \uc2 Yes.\par \par \uc2 Q:\u160\'00\'A0How is this not child abuse?\par \par \uc2 NIELSEN: Which?\u160\'00\'A0 Be more specific, please.\u160\'00\'A0 Enforcing the law?\par \par \uc2 Q:\u160\'00\'A0The images that Cecilia was talking about, and the sounds that we've seen from these big box stores \u8212\'20\'14 the Walmarts, the other stores \u8212\'20\'14 when you see this, how is this not specifically child abuse for these innocent children who are indeed being separated from their parents?\par \par \uc2 NIELSEN: So I want to be clear on a couple other things.\u160\'00\'A0 The vast majority \u8212\'20\'14 vast, vast majority \u8212\'20\'14 of children who are in the care of \uc2 HHS\uc2  right now \u8212\'20\'14 10,000 of the 12,000 \u8212\'20\'14 were sent here alone by their parents.\u160\'00\'A0 That's when they were separated.\u160\'00\'A0 So somehow, we've conflated everything.\par \par \uc2 But there's two separate issues.\u160\'00\'A0 Ten thousand of those currently in custody were sent by their parents, with strangers, to undertake a completely dangerous and deadly travel alone.\u160\'00\'A0 We now care for them.\u160\'00\'A0 We have high standards.\u160\'00\'A0 We give them meals.\u160\'00\'A0 We give them education.\u160\'00\'A0 We give them medical care.\u160\'00\'A0 There's videos; there's TVs.\u160\'00\'A0 I've visited the detention centers myself.\u160\'00\'A0 That would be my answer to that question.\par \par \uc2 Yes.\par \par \uc2 Q:\u160\'00\'A0If I could follow up, though.\u160\'00\'A0 For the hundreds that are not included in there \u8212\'20\'14 you said 10,000 \u8212\'20\'14 but for the hundreds that we have seen \u8212\'20\'14 perhaps up to 2,000 \u8212\'20\'14 are there any examples of child abuse, do you believe?\u160\'00\'A0 And how could this not be child abuse for the people who are taken from their parents?\u160\'00\'A0 Not the ones who are sent here, with their parents' blessing, with a smuggler, but the people who are taken from their parents?\par \par \uc2 NIELSEN: Unfortunately, I am not in any position to deal with hearsay stories.\u160\'00\'A0 If someone has a specific allegation, as I always do when I testify, I ask that they provide that information to the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2  .\u160\'00\'A0 We will look into it.\u160\'00\'A0 Of course, we do not want any situation where a child is not completely adequately taken care o\par \par \uc2 Yes.\par \par \uc2 Q: A couple of questions.\u160\'00\'A0 One, why is the government only releasing images of the boys who are being held?\u160\'00\'A0 Where are the girls?\u160\'00\'A0 Where are the young toddlers?\par \par \uc2 NIELSEN: I don't know.\u160\'00\'A0 I am not familiar with those particular images.\par \par \uc2 Q:\u160\'00\'A0You don't know where they are?\u160\'00\'A0 Do you know where the girls are?\u160\'00\'A0 Do you know where the young toddlers are?\par \par \uc2 NIELSEN: We have children in DHS care \u8212\'20\'14 both.\u160\'00\'A0 But as you know, most of the children, after 72 hours, are transferred to \uc2 HHS\uc2  .\u160\'00\'A0 So I don't know what pictures you're referencing, but I'd have to refer you to \uc2 HHS\uc2  .\par \par \uc2 Q:\u160\'00\'A0We've seen images of boys, but we just haven't seen any of the girls or any of the young toddlers.\u160\'00\'A0 And you're saying that they are being well cared for.\u160\'00\'A0 So how can you make that claim if you don't know where they are?\par \par \uc2 NIELSEN: It's not that I don't know where they are.\u160\'00\'A0 I'm saying that the vast majority are held by \uc2 Health and Human Services\uc2  .\u160\'00\'A0 We transfer them after 72 hours.\u160\'00\'A0 I don't know what pictures you're speaking about, but perhaps there are \u8212\'20\'14\par \par \uc2 Q: The pictures have been released to public; they've been aired all over national television.\par \par \uc2 NIELSEN: Okay.\u160\'00\'A0 By DHS?\u160\'00\'A0 Or by \uc2 HHS\uc2  ?\par \par \uc2 Q:\u160\'00\'A0By DHS.\par \par \uc2 NIELSEN: Okay.\u160\'00\'A0 So let's find out from \uc2 HHS\uc2  .\u160\'00\'A0 I don't think there's anything other than (inaudible) pictures.\par \par \uc2 Q: They were released by your department.\u160\'00\'A0 I mean, they've been aired all over national television throughout the day \u8212\'20\'14 the kids who are being held in the cages.\u160\'00\'A0 We've only seen the boys.\par \par \uc2 NIELSEN: I will look into that.\u160\'00\'A0 I'm not aware that there is another picture.\par \par \uc2 Yes.\par \par \uc2 Q: Secretary, let me just follow up very quickly, because you continue to insist that this is something that Congress can change \u8212\'20\'14\par \par \uc2 NIELSEN: Yes.\par \par \uc2 Q:\u160\'00\'A0\u8212\'20\'14 and yet this is something that was enacted after the attorney general announced the zero-tolerance policy.\u160\'00\'A0 This never happened before he announced the zero-tolerance policy.\par \par \uc2 NIELSEN: That's actually not true.\u160\'00\'A0 So the last administration \u8212\'20\'14\par \par \uc2 Q:\u160\'00\'A0Well, we've never seen this under previous administrations.\par \par \uc2 NIELSEN: \u8212\'20\'14 the Obama administration, the Bush administration all separated families at the \u8212\'20\'14\par \par \uc2 Q:\u160\'00\'A0We didn't see kids separated from their parents.\par \par \uc2 NIELSEN: They absolutely did.\u160\'00\'A0 They did \u8212\'20\'14 their rate was less than ours, but they absolutely did do this.\u160\'00\'A0 This is not new.\par \par \uc2 Q:\u160\'00\'A0There were unaccompanied minors, there's no doubt about that.\u160\'00\'A0 But this \u8212\'20\'14\par \par \uc2 NIELSEN: They separated families.\par \par \uc2 Q: \u8212\'20\'14 separating kids at this rate from their parents is something new and specific to this administration once the attorney general announced the zero-tolerance policy.\u160\'00\'A0 So why doesn't the president pick up the phone and change the policy?\u160\'00\'A0 He said he hates it.\par \par \uc2 NIELSEN:\u160\'00\'A0I think what the president is trying to do is find a long-term fix.\u160\'00\'A0 So why don't we have Congress changes the laws to change \u8212\'20\'14\par \par \uc2 Q: (Inaudible.)\par \par \uc2 NIELSEN: No.\u160\'00\'A0 Congress could fix this tomorrow.\par \par \uc2 Yes.\u160\'00\'A0 I think you were next, right?\par \par \uc2 Q:\u160\'00\'A0Yeah.\u160\'00\'A0 Madam Secretary, President Trump has had a lot to say the last few days about immigration, but he's offered no compassion to the families that are being separated at the border.\u160\'00\'A0 Do you know why that is?\u160\'00\'A0 And why won't he simply pause your department's enforcement of this administration policy until Congress reaches that long-term fix so that these families can be reunited?\par \par \uc2 NIELSEN: He has been attempting to work with Congress since he's been in office.\u160\'00\'A0 He's made it very clear that we will enforce the laws of the United States as long as this administration is here.\u160\'00\'A0 As part of that, he has continually reached out to Congress to fix this.\u160\'00\'A0 And I think what you've seen him do in the last few days is that: is continue to tell Congress, "Please work with us."\u160\'00\'A0 The system is broken.\u160\'00\'A0 The only people that benefit from the system right now are the smugglers, the traffickers, those who are pedaling drugs, and terrorists.\u160\'00\'A0 So let's fix the system.\par \par \uc2 Yes.\par \par \uc2 Q: That didn't answer the question.\u160\'00\'A0 And does he feel any compassion for the families that are being separated?\u160\'00\'A0 He has talked about the parents being possible criminals.\u160\'00\'A0 He has blamed it on Democrats.\u160\'00\'A0 He has offered no words of compassion.\par \par \uc2 NIELSEN: I think he has said in tweets that he would like Congress to act to end the underlying laws that require the separation.\par \par \uc2 Q: Madam Secretary, it seemed like a couple days ago, both the President and in your tweets, that the main posture or point was to say that this is not the administration's policy.\u160\'00\'A0 But it seems like, in the last couple \u8212\'20\'14 well, today \u8212\'20\'14 that the message is a little different; is to say, well, this is our policy, but it's our policy because either we believe it's a deterrent or we don't believe we have the resources to move families entirely.\par \par \uc2 And I'm just wondering \u8212\'20\'14 I want to make sure we get the reporting right \u8212\'20\'14 which of those is the most precise way to describe how the administration feels?\u160\'00\'A0 And given the blowback by a number of Republicans as well as Democrats, are you considering rethinking this based on feedback?\u160\'00\'A0 Or is this the administration's position going forward \u8212\'20\'14 period, paragraph?\par \par \uc2 NIELSEN: The laws prohibit us from detaining families while they go through prosecution for illegally entering the border, and while they go through prosecutions for immigration proceedings.\u160\'00\'A0 If we close the loopholes, we can keep the families together, which is what they did in the last administration until a court ruled that we can no longer do that.\u160\'00\'A0 After 20 days, we have to release both unaccompanied children and accompanied children \u8212\'20\'14 which means that we cannot detain families together.\u160\'00\'A0 The only option is to not enforce the law at all.\par \par \uc2 Yes.\par \par \uc2 Q: Okay, so going back to these two questions from Kristen and Margaret, you said that you want Congress to close some loopholes.\u160\'00\'A0 With that, you also said that you want to make this work.\u160\'00\'A0 Now, are these kids being used as pawns for a wall?\u160\'00\'A0 Many people are asking that.\u160\'00\'A0 And Democrats are saying this is your discretion and there is no law that says that this White House can separate parents from their children.\par \par \uc2 NIELSEN: The kids are being used by pawns by the smugglers and the traffickers.\u160\'00\'A0 Again, let's just pause to think about this statistic: 314 percent increase in adults showing up with kids that are not a family unit.\u160\'00\'A0 Those are traffickers, those are smugglers.\u160\'00\'A0 That is MS-13.\u160\'00\'A0 Those are criminals and those are abusers.\par \par \uc2 Q:\u160\'00\'A0When did \u8212\'20\'14\par \par \uc2 Q:\u160\'00\'A0Just let her finish.\par \par \uc2 NIELSEN: So \u8212\'20\'14 thank you.\u160\'00\'A0 All I'm trying to say is, closing that loophole will enable us to detain families together throughout the proceeding as they've done in previous administration\par \par \uc2 Q: Madam Secretary.\u160\'00\'A0 Madam Secretary, can you definitively say, are the children being used as pawns against --- for a wall.\u160\'00\'A0 Yes or no?\u160\'00\'A0 Can you say yes or no to that?\par \par \uc2 NIELSEN: The children are not being used as a pawn.\u160\'00\'A0 We are trying to protect the children, which is why I'm asking Congress to act.\par \par \uc2 Yes.\par \par \uc2 Q: (Inaudible) as the legal framework for the decisions that your administration has made.\u160\'00\'A0 What we're seeing \u8212\'20\'14 the pictures, the audio, the stories \u8212\'20\'14 are they an intended consequence of the administration's decision-making or an unintended consequence?\par \par \uc2 NIELSEN: I think that they reflect the focus of those who post such pictures and narratives.\u160\'00\'A0 The narratives we don't see are the narratives of the crime, of the opioids, of the smugglers, of people who are killed by gang members, of American children who are recruited, and then, when they lose the drugs, they're tased and beaten.\par \par \uc2 So we don't have a balanced view of what's happening.\u160\'00\'A0 But what's happening at the border is the border is being overrun by those who have no right to cross it.\u160\'00\'A0 As I said before, if you're seeking asylum, go to a port of entry.\u160\'00\'A0 You do not need to break the law of the United States to seek asylum.\par \par \uc2 Q:\u160\'00\'A0People are being turned away from ports of entry, Madam Secretary.\par \par \uc2 NIELSEN: That actually is incorrect.\u160\'00\'A0 We have limited resources.\u160\'00\'A0 We have multiple missions at CBP.\u160\'00\'A0 And what we do is, based on the very high standards we have, if we do not have enough bed space, if we do not have enough medical personnel on staff, if we do have enough caretakers on staff, then we will tell people that come to the border they need to come back.\u160\'00\'A0 We are not turning them away.\u160\'00\'A0 We are saying: We want to take care of you in the right way; right now, we do not have the resources at this particular moment in time.\u160\'00\'A0 Come back.\par \par \uc2 Q:\u160\'00\'A0Thank you very much.\u160\'00\'A0 Are you intending for this to play out as it is playing out?\u160\'00\'A0 Are you intending for parents to be separated from their children?\u160\'00\'A0 Are you intending to send a message?\par \par \uc2 NIELSEN: I find that offensive.\u160\'00\'A0 No.\u160\'00\'A0 Because why would I ever create a policy that purposely does that?\par \par \uc2 Q:\u160\'00\'A0Perhaps as a deterrent.\par \par \uc2 NIELSEN: No.\par \par \uc2 Q: AG Sessions says it was a deterrent.\par \par \uc2 NIELSEN: The way that it works \u8212\'20\'14\par \par \uc2 Q: The Attorney General said it was a deterrent.\par \par \uc2 NIELSEN: That's not the question that you asked me.\par \par \uc2 But the answer is, it's a law passed by the \uc2 United States Congress\uc2  .\u160\'00\'A0 Rather than fixing the law, Congress is asking those of us who enforce the law to turn our backs on the law and not enforce the law.\u160\'00\'A0 It's not an answer.\u160\'00\'A0 The answer is to fix the laws.\par \par \uc2 Q: Will the administration refrain from its current policy if Congress were to pass something that's close to what you want?\u160\'00\'A0 Or will it continue to require the separation of parents from their children until the President gets exactly what he wants?\par \par \uc2 NIELSEN: If Congress closes the loopholes, some of which \u8212\'20\'14 many of which are closed in the two bills that we hope are taken up this week by the House, then they close the loopholes and the families will stay together throughout the proceedings.\par \par \uc2 Thank you.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020180619ee6j002mh\par }\page

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The political group founded by \uc2 Sen. Bernie Sanders\uc2  (I-Vt.) after his presidential campaign ended\u160\'00\'A0may part ways with an associate whose Fox News appearances and tweets sometimes swerved into criticism of the Democratic Party's focus on "illegal immigrants."\par \par \uc2 In the wake of a critical story in \uc2 Politico\uc2 , and a subsequent \uc2 Facebook\uc2  post by former Our Revolution political director Erika Andiola, the Sanders-founded group said it would reevaluate the role of Tezlyn Figaro, who was brought on board last year when former Ohio state senator Nina Turner took over. (\uc2 Politico\uc2  had reported "board members have been told her contract will end soon.")\par \par \uc2 "The comments made by Tezlyn Figaro are not beliefs espoused by myself or Our Revolution," Turner said in a statement. "I understand that we all have room to grow and evolve, and while we encourage growth, I am committed to maintaining a work environment that is safe and supportive for all. Tezlyn has publicly apologized for her comments and while she is still part of our paid staff, the matter is under advisement by myself and the Our Revolution board of directors."\par \par \uc2 In the \uc2 Facebook\uc2  post, Andiola posted images of several tweets Figaro sent before joining Our Revolution. In one, Figaro combined her frustration about a focus on the new administration's immigration policy with a meme about black incarceration rates. "U r being distracted abt ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS meanwhile more blacks are under prison/parole control in in 2010 than were enslaved in 1850," Figaro wrote.\par \par \uc2 In another, Figaro recapped what she had said that day on "\uc2 Fox\uc2  and Friends," one of several \uc2 Fox\uc2  shows where she had made appearances as a disgruntled veteran of the Sanders campaign. "If AMERICAN black folks can go to jail when they break the law then certainly so can an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 ," Figaro wrote.\par \par \uc2 "I became sick to my stomach and could not stop crying all night," Andiola wrote, describing the posts. "Despite what the article says, there has been a lot of incredible work done at the grassroots level.

She was overruled by the group's board, in part because of her frequent Fox News appearances, where she has appeared both to debate conservatives and to criticize the Democratic Party.\par \par \uc2 In the final months of the 2016 campaign, as Sanders campaigned for \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 , Figaro appeared on \uc2 Fox\uc2  to attack the Democratic nominee's focus and funding. In 2017, she appeared on the network to argue that the \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2  would "lose millions of votes" as people angry about the outcome of the party's leadership election would "go forward with the 'Dem exit' " \u8212\'20\'14 at the same time that Sanders was urging supporters to focus on the "unity reform commission" that would change the party's primary rules.\par \par \uc2 Andiola's post went further than criticizing Figaro. In it, Andiola claimed that her late 2017 work to defend the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program led to her untimely departure from Our Revolution.\par \par \uc2 "When me and another Dreamer went to NYC on the day Trump rescinded DACA to sit in to defend our community, I had to do it on vacation time," she wrote. Immigrants brought to the United States as children are often referred to as "dreamers."\u160\'00\'A0"Senator Turner was going to force OR to leave the OurDream coalition we started because we were challenging Democrats as well as Republicans and because we believed our strategy had to include civil disobedience. Finally, I asked for a leave of absence or some way to work this out, but instead I was fired the very next day without any further dialogue."\par \par \uc2 At the time, Andiola's advocacy bothered Our Revolution \u8212\'20\'14 which, like Sanders, supported using must-pass funding bills to get a permanent DACA solution through Congress \u8212\'20\'14 when it crossed powerful Democrats. Andiola retweeted a video of activists crashing a news conference being held by House Minority Leader \uc2 Nancy Pelosi\uc2  (D-Calif.), and tweeted other videos of activists sitting and singing inside the offices of Democrats whose votes on the plan were already secure.\par \par \uc2 But on Tuesday, Turner took a diplomatic approach to the criticism.\par \par \uc2 "I was sorry to see Erika Andiola's statement last night," said Turner. "I have the utmost respect for her commitment to immigrant justice, and I wish her the absolute best. Given the sensitivity of personnel matters, I am unable to comment further."\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020180522ee5m006mx\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 We shouldn't be surprised, but we should be irate that, after blocking again and again bipartisan measures to address immigration and specifically the beneficiaries of the Deferred Action\u160\'00\'A0for Childhood Arrivals, President Trump and his congressional toadies blamed Democrats for failing to help "dreamers." Likewise, no one who followed the campaign or has listened to Trump's rhetoric in office can be stunned that he would declare at an immigration meeting, "We have people coming into the country, or trying to come in, we're stopping a lot of them, but we're taking people out of the country, you wouldn't believe how bad\u160\'00\'A0these people are.\u160\'00\'A0These aren't people. These are animals, and we're taking them out of the country at a rate that's never happened before."\par \par \uc2 Even if he was referring to the tiny percentage of immigrants who commit crimes, his efforts to conflate criminals with all illegal immigrants is repulsive, as is calling any human being an "animal." Moreover, it is false that we have never deported so many people; President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  deported far more. Trump's continued misrepresentation of the numbers seeks to instill fear and prompt egregious action.\par \par \uc2 Speaking of egregious action, the policy of separating children from their \uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2  parents and then warehousing them on military bases sounds like something out of a dystopian movie. Trump had the nerve to blame Democrats for this new policy. "The Democrats gave us that law," he lied. "It's a horrible thing we have to break up families." His cowardice is quite striking: He hasn't the guts to accept responsibility for his own handiwork.\par \par \uc2 Trump's utterance came\u160\'00\'A0the day after \uc2 Kirstjen Nielsen\uc2 , the secretary of homeland security, was defending this stunningly inhumane policy. \uc2 CNN\uc2  reported:\par \par \uc2 The Trump administration last month\u160\'00\'A0testified\u160\'00\'A0it lost track of 20% \u8212\'20\'14 or nearly 1,500 children \u8212\'20\'14 of the undocumented minors that had been in its custody over a three-month "We are begging you, if in fact this is going to be the outcome, where we're separating children, in some cases infants, from their parents, we need to know where these kids are," said North Dakota [Democratic Sen.] \uc2 Heidi Heitkamp\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 As if that were not enough of the "man's inhumanity to man" report, House Republican leadership demonstrated their determination to stick by the most anti-immigrant segment of the GOP. Alas, House Speaker \uc2 Paul D. Ryan\uc2  (R-Wis.) is facing a revolt among his ranks from congressmen either horrified by the party's stance or horrified they may lose their seats. "Two more Republicans signed on to a measure that would force an immigration vote in the House just hours after [Ryan] urged his colleagues not to in a closed-door meeting on Wednesday," \uc2 CNN\uc2  reported on Wednesday. "The signatures of New York Rep. John Katko and Michigan Rep. David Trott brings the total to 20 Republicans supporting the move, five short of the number needed to force a vote if all Democrats sign on as well."\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020180517ee5h0038r\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 White House Chief of Staff \uc2 John F. Kelly\uc2  provided another reminder that\u160\'00\'A0he continues to support\u160\'00\'A0President Trump's hard-line immigration policies in an \uc2 NPR\uc2  interview that aired Friday.\par \par \uc2 Kelly was defending the\u160\'00\'A0Justice Department's policy that includes separating children from parents being prosecuted for\u160\'00\'A0 immigrating illegally into the United States, when he\u160\'00\'A0told \uc2 NPR\uc2  that undocumented immigrants do not "easily assimilate" into American culture. Here's what he said:\par \par \uc2 The vast majority of the people that move illegally into the United States are not bad people. They're not criminals. They're not MS-13. ... But they're also not people that would easily assimilate into the United States, into our modern society. They're overwhelmingly rural people. In the countries they come from, fourth-, fifth-, sixth-grade educations are kind of the norm. They don't speak English; obviously that's a big thing. ... They don't integrate well; they don't have skills. They're not bad people. They're coming here for a reason. And I sympathize with the reason. But the laws are the laws. ... The big point is they elected to come illegally into the United States, and this is a technique that no one hopes will be used extensively or for very long.\par \par \uc2 Kelly's belief is a popular one from hard-line conservative groups, and that line of thinking often extends to claims that undocumented and legal immigrants are more of a drain on the American economy than an asset.\par \par \uc2 In a 2016 piece on welfare use in immigrant households published by the Center for Immigration Studies, a nonprofit group advocating for lower immigration, Jason Richwine claims that both legal and \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  households cost taxpayers more than native citizens in welfare dollars than the average household of native-born citizens, and that "The greater consumption of welfare dollars by immigrants can be explained in large part by their lower level of education and larger number of children compared to natives."\par \par \uc2 However, other right-leaning think tanks disputed the findings in the CIS report. \uc2 The Cato Institute\uc2 , a libertarian think tank, picked apart the methodology used by CIS to support their claims, calling their findings "exaggerated."\par \par \uc2 CIS \u8212\'20\'14 and many hard-liners on immigration \u8212\'20\'14 don't want to see less illegal immigration. They want to see\u160\'00\'A0less immigration period,\u160\'00\'A0wrote Alex Nowrasteh,\u160\'00\'A0a senior immigration policy analyst at Cato. If they can argue that immigrants struggle to "Americanize" well and instead end up draining this country's resources, they hope lawmakers will back policy ideas that keep immigration numbers as close to zero as possible.\par \par \uc2 It's true that immigrants from rural communities, with little education, no command of English and\u160\'00\'A0a lack of skills to gain meaningful employment do not find assimilating into "modern society" easy. But it's not impossible. Beginning more than a century ago, nearly\u160\'00\'A02 million immigrants from Ireland \u8212\'20\'14 the country from which Kelly's\u160\'00\'A0ancestors descend \u8212\'20\'14 came to the United States, where they\u160\'00\'A0faced harsh backlash from native citizens. People of Irish heritage now make up 10 percent of the U.S. population, according to the Census Bureau.\par \par \uc2 As with previous cases, not all of Kelly's statements Friday totally meshed with the president's.\par \par \uc2 In the same \uc2 NPR\uc2  interview, Kelly spoke in favor of granting a path to citizenship for immigrants who have been in the United States under temporary protected status from countries like El Salvador, Haiti and Honduras, if they had been here long enough to assimilate.\par \par \uc2 You take the Central Americans that have been here 20-plus years. I mean if you really start looking at them and saying, "Okay, you know you've been here 20 years. What have you done with your life?" Well, I've met an American guy and I have three children and I've worked and gotten a degree or I'm a brick mason or something like that. That's what I think we should do \u8212\'20\'14 for the ones that have been here for shorter periods of time, the whatever it was that gave them TPS status in the first place. If that is solved back in their home countries they should go home.\par \par \uc2 Still, Kelly's strong stance against illegal immigration will probably land well with Trump's base, and could\u160\'00\'A0help him remain in good favor with his boss despite frequent reports that Trump is often frustrated with Kelly's performance in other areas. Kelly spoke to \uc2 NPR\uc2  the same day Trump reportedly unleashed a tirade on Homeland Security Secretary\u160\'00\'A0\uc2 Kirstjen Nielsen\uc2 , a close Kelly ally, over what\u160\'00\'A0Trump views as unsatisfactory border security.\par \par \uc2 But it's worth highlighting that significant percentages of\u160\'00\'A0Americans\u160\'00\'A0don't share the Trump White House's hardest positions on immigration. And separating children from their parents has previously been a line that even conservatives did not want to cross.\par \par \uc2 Like Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Kelly has made it clear that "law and order" \u8212\'20\'14 perhaps based on stereotypical ideas of outsiders \u8212\'20\'14 will be the dominant philosophy he employs when responding to immigrants seeking the American Dream that Kelly's ancestors pursued.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020180511ee5b005xy\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 right-turn\par {\*\bkmkstart toc75}{\*\bkmkend toc75}\b \uc2 Don Blankenship\uc2  tanks in W.Va., but the GOP has a new problem\b0\par\par\uc2 By Jennifer Rubin \par \uc2 590 \uc2 words\par \uc2 9 May 2018\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2018, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 In two key Senate primary races \u8212\'20\'14 in Indiana and West Virginia \u8212\'20\'14 the Republican Party had the opportunity to pick a high-risk Trumpian candidate, thereby sacrificing possible pickups that might secure its Senate majority. President Trump won both red states handily, putting incumbent Democrats in a precarious spot. In one race, the GOP rejected an extreme, racist candidate (an ex-con to boot); in the other GOP primary, voters chose a candidate who embraced Trump.\par \par \uc2 The most closely watched race was in West Virginia featuring \uc2 Don\u160\'00\'A0Blankenship\uc2  . He's quite a character \u8212\'20\'14 an ex-convict sent to prison for his role in a 2010 mine explosion that killed 29 people. He has engaged in vile race-baiting, calling Transportation Secretary \uc2 Elaine Chao\uc2  's father a "wealthy China-person" and labeling her husband,\u160\'00\'A0Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), "Cocaine Mitch" in a notorious TV ad (based on recovery of a small amount of cocaine in a ship owned by Chao's father's company \u8212\'20\'14 which has nothing to do with either McConnell or his wife). (Indicative of the spinelessness that now afflicts Republicans, McConnell refused to say before the election whether the ad was racist.\u160\'00\'A0Trump in the final days of the campaign spoke up, but only to say that Blankenship was not electable.) West Virginia Republican voters, to their credit, rejected Blankenship handily.\u160\'00\'A0The lesson here seems to be: Don't wait for craven GOP officials to show moral leadership; it's up to ordinary voters to summon the gumption to reject hateful candidates.\par \par \uc2 Blankenship wound up in third place. Republicans should take note, however: Democratic turnout for an uncompetitive primary exceeded turnout for the hotly contested GOP nomination by more than 23,000 \u8212\'20\'14 continuing a pattern of high voter enthusiasm among Democrats.\par \par \uc2 In Indiana, candidate \uc2 Mike Braun\uc2 , who clung tightly to Trump, won his race over two better-known congressmen, giving some comfort to \uc2 Sen. Joe Donnelly\uc2  (D-Ind.) once thought to be vulnerable. In Trumpian fashion,\u160\'00\'A0Braun\u160\'00\'A0likes to play the anti-immigrant card. In March, he was forced to take down an ad making hay out of the deaths of two Indiana residents killed by a drunk driver suspected to be an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . The widow of one of the men killed went public with her outrage, leaving Braun to plead that he had no idea the ad would be so offensive. Braun, a wealthy businessman, may be able to self-finance. The downside, however, is his business record, which has Democrats salivating. The Associated Press reported: "Meyer Distributing, a Jasper-based national auto parts distribution company Braun owns, does brisk business importing goods from the same overseas countries he has criticized for taking American jobs. He also has accepted government subsidies, despite criticizing the practice. \u8230\'20\'26 And lawsuits filed against his companies \u8212\'20\'14 backed up by federal trucking and labor records \u8212\'20\'14 present a picture of a boss who has overworked and underpaid employees."\par \par \uc2 Braun seems to get sued almost as much as Trump does ("Workers have sued in West Virginia, Oklahoma and California, alleging they were forced to work long hours in unsafe conditions and denied overtime pay, meal times and breaks"). Republicans' selection of Braun, an inexperienced candidate with a dicey business record, may give Donnelly enough ammunition to hold on to his seat.\par \par \uc2 Perhaps Trump fever is dissipating, if only a little. Whether Republicans can stem a blue tide heading their way in November remains an open question.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020180509ee590038y\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Few would have guessed the next shooting to make national news would be carried out by a female animal-rights activist enraged at \uc2 YouTube\uc2  for demonetizing her fitness videos. And because \uc2 YouTube\uc2  shooter Nasim Najafi Aghdam doesn't fit into the familiar narratives of the gun epidemic, those on the right have taken to \uc2 Twitter\uc2  to create narratives of their own.\par \par \uc2 This was another instance of Islamist terrorism, some announced, and Aghdam was Muslim. (She was\u160\'00\'A0not.) Or she was an "\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 ." (That's also wrong.) Or, better yet, an artificially intelligent robot. (Wait, what?) One contingent even postulated that the name "Nasim" is traditionally male, so Aghdam must have been a transgender woman \u8212\'20\'14 after all, another added, cis "women would never do such a thing."\par \par \uc2 And for pro-gun commentators less prone to conspiracy theorizing, Aghdam was the exception that disproves the rule. No longer, conservatives crowed, could liberals argue that angry white males armed with semiautomatic rifles were the greatest threat to American civilians.\par \par \uc2 There's a problem with this argument, apart from the vulgarity of smirking when a shooting proves agenda-convenient. The fact that Aghdam doesn't match the common profile of a shooter who captures this much media attention underscores the one thing that does unite every instance of gun violence: guns.\par \par \uc2 One reason Aghdam doesn't match the common profile of a mass shooter may be that she's not one. Instead, she's part of a side story to the saga of large-scale slaughters like the Parkland, Fla., massacre: "active shooter" incidents, as\u160\'00\'A0law enforcement\u160\'00\'A0labels them, that don't necessarily end in a slew of deaths. Aghdam injured three; no one except Aghdam has died. Apart from her gender, it turns out, the circumstances of her assault don't diverge much from the norm.\par \par \uc2 Aghdam stirred such a frenzy in part because she chose to attack one of the highest-profile workplaces in the country. But the \uc2 FBI\uc2  counts 220 "active shooter" events between 2000 and 2016; stories similar to this one simply don't often inspire such feverish coverage or conspiracizing. And even those less-noticed tales garner more attention than the firearm homicides that have soared in recent years, as firearms in circulation have soared, too.\par \par \uc2 So, no, Aghdam doesn't fit the narrative of the white male gun nut simmering with repressed rage who lets it all out with an AR-15 (though perhaps she would have killed more people had California's stringent gun laws not made it so difficult to acquire\u160\'00\'A0that weapon of war). She doesn't fit the narrative of the Islamist terrorist who murders in the name of jihad, either. But Aghdam does fit a narrative that's bigger than any of that, and it's not one that does the \uc2 National Rifle Association\uc2  any favors: She wanted to hurt people, and she had a gun to help her do it.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020180405ee45005pm\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 right-turn\par {\*\bkmkstart toc77}{\*\bkmkend toc77}\b \uc2 Trump stymied again in an effort to stomp on the states \b0\par\par\uc2 By Jennifer Rubin \par \uc2 657 \uc2 words\par \uc2 20 March 2018\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2018, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The Post reports:\par \par \uc2 The Supreme Court on Monday turned down a request from Republican legislative leaders in Pennsylvania to block the implementation of a redrawn congressional map that creates more parity between the political parties in the state.\par \par \uc2 The practical impact is the 2018 elections are likely to be held under a map much more favorable to Democrats, who scored an apparent victory last week in a special election in a strongly Republican state district. The 2011 map that has been used this decade has resulted in Republicans consistently winning 13 of the state's 18 congressional seats.\par \par \uc2 Monday's action was the second time that the court declined to get involved in the partisan battle that has roiled Pennsylvania politics. The commonwealth's highest court earlier this year ruled that a map drawn by Republican leaders in 2011 "clearly, plainly and palpably" violated the free-and-equal-elections clause of the Pennsylvania Constitution.\par \par \uc2 Understand that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that, under state law, the gerrymandered map did not pass muster. What right does the federal government\u160\'00\'A0have to tell Pennsylvania courts what Pennsylvania law says? None, as it turns out. What is peculiar is that Republicans would take such an obviously outlandish position \u8212\'20\'14 one that trashes the 10th Amendment and the touchstone of federalism.\par \par \uc2 The Court's extended consideration was a bit peculiar.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 U.S. Supreme Court\uc2  deliberated nearly two weeks before turning down the request to stop the map from being used in this fall's elections. Generally the justices stay out of the way when a state's highest court is interpreting its own state constitution.\par \par \uc2 But perhaps the court was waiting\u160\'00\'A0until a federal\u160\'00\'A0three-judge panel hearing a separate challenge had ruled. (That court turned down Republicans as well.) Election law guru \uc2 Rick Hasen\uc2  speculated that maybe one or more justices "needed more time to consider the issues, and was pondering a dissent but then decided not to write."\par \par \uc2 This is not the first time during the Trump era that Republicans have sought to stomp over state matters. Its effort to dragoon cities into enforcing immigration laws (the so-called "sanctuary city" issue) was blocked last year. As was reported in The Post in November, a\u160\'00\'A0federal court found\u160\'00\'A0that "the Trump administration's efforts to\u160\'00\'A0move\u160\'00\'A0local officials to cooperate with its efforts to deport undocumented immigrants violated the separation of powers doctrine as well as the Fifth and Tenth amendments." A federal court in Pennsylvania also blocked the administration from cutting off funds on the basis of its sanctuary-city order.\par \par \uc2 The administration is also\u160\'00\'A0suing California for\u160\'00\'A0its attempt to restrict the conditions under which\u160\'00\'A0the state\u160\'00\'A0is required to turn over suspected illegal immigrants to\u160\'00\'A0federal officials,\u160\'00\'A0and for preventing\u160\'00\'A0state officials from sharing nonpublic information with\u160\'00\'A0federal officials\u160\'00\'A0as to when a suspected \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  is to be released. In essence, by executive order, the administration is attempting to run roughshod over local and state law-enforcement operations and priorities.\par \par \uc2 Over a year ago, libertarian legal scholar Ilya Somin wrote:\par \par \uc2 The Supreme Court has\u160\'00\'A0repeatedly ruled that the federal government may not "commandeer" state and local officials by compelling them to enforce federal law. Such policies violate the Tenth Amendment.\u160\'00\'A0. . . Trump's order is exactly the kind of high-handed federal coercion of states and undermining of separation of powers that outraged conservatives under [President Barack] Obama. In fact, Obama did not go as far as Trump seems to do here. Obama never claimed sweeping authority to impose new conditions on federal grants beyond those specifically imposed by Congress.\par \par \uc2 I have every expectation that if\u160\'00\'A0it should\u160\'00\'A0ever come to pass\u160\'00\'A0that a Democratic president\u160\'00\'A0attempts\u160\'00\'A0to enlist state enforcement officials in some policy objective, Republicans would be the first to scream about the destruction of our federalist system.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020180320ee3k003e9\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 European politics has turned into a Greek tragedy.\par \par \uc2 The very thing that was supposed to stop the type of virulent nationalism that tore the continent apart in the 1930s from ever coming back \u8212\'20\'14 the \uc2 European Union\uc2  \u8212\'20\'14 is a big part of why it's starting to do so today. It's bad in post-communist states like Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic, but it's especially hopeless in the ones that use the euro. That's because the common currency has kept some of them from growing, and all of them (other than maybe Germany) from controlling their own economic destinies. That's a toxic combination. It has made politics go from being a debate, among other things, about how much to tax or spend into one that's entirely about who belongs and who doesn't.\par \par \uc2 The center-left can't hope to compete under those terms, and it hasn't. It has lost ground to the far-right almost everywhere.\par \par \uc2 Take Italy. Its politics have always been a bit dysfunctional, perhaps best exemplified by the fact that its major center-right party is led by billionaire media mogul \uc2 Silvio Berlusconi\uc2 , who has a penchant for corruption, sex scandals and corruption involving sex scandals. That, though, almost seems like a quaint concern with the way the country's political center has been imploding lately. Consider this: Italy's two mainstream parties have gone from combining for 70 percent of the vote in 2008 to 47 percent in 2013 and now just 33 percent in the elections last Sunday. The center-left Democratic Party, in power until now, was particularly hard hit when you consider the fact that it didn't even have any big rivals on the left to contend with.\par \par \uc2 In their place have come populists of various stripes. The first is the Five Star Movement, an ideologically inchoate protest party founded by a comedian that supports a universal basic income, is against mandatory vaccinations, is vaguely opposed to immigration, has toyed with the idea of leaving the euro and \u8212\'20\'14 with the way it studiously refuses to join any coalition government despite the fact that it has become the country's single largest party \u8212\'20\'14 stands above all else for giving the finger to what it perceives as a self-dealing political establishment. The second is the League, a onetime northern separatist party that has reinvented itself as a stridently anti-immigrant one. It has toned down some of its euroskepticism \u8212\'20\'14 the euro "was, is, and remains a mistake," its leader \uc2 Matteo Salvini\uc2  has said, but it would be "unthinkable" to hold a referendum on getting rid of it now. But it wants a 15 percent flat tax, and, as is practically de rigueur among today's far-right, wants closer ties with Russia. It also wants to end sanctions against North Korea, which Salvini has said has a "splendid sense of community."\par \par \uc2 None of this should be too surprising. What else do you expect after two lost decades? Italy, you see, is poorer now than it was when it joined the euro in 1999. Which is to say that its GDP per capita, adjusted for local prices, has actually fallen over this time. But as incredible as that is, what's even more so is that it isn't really clear why this has happened. There wasn't the same boom-and-bust cycle that there was in, say, Spain. Instead, Italy just ... stopped growing. Part of it is that Italy has a lot of inefficient small businesses, another is that it has a lot of red tape that keeps businesses small, and the last is that there's just a lot of corruption. But, in any case, there's no debating the results: Italy has done even worse than Greece the last 20 years.\par \par \uc2 Now, there are two things you'd expect here. The first is that a zero sum economy would lead to zero sum politics. In other words, a shrinking economic pie would make people fight more about who's getting how big a slice \u8212\'20\'14 especially if they think someone, like, say, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , doesn't deserve one at all. That has indeed been the case with the way that the League's extreme anti-immigrant and pro-Christian rhetoric has helped turn it into the second-biggest party in the country.\par \par \uc2 The second is that you'd think the center-left would respond by calling for some kind of stimulus to jump-start the economy \u8212\'20\'14 but it's not. The euro won't let it. Or, more specifically, the \uc2 European Central Bank\uc2  won't. The important thing to understand is that it's what is keeping the country's borrowing costs down and its banks afloat, so it could crash Italy's economy if their government ever tried to defy the euro zone's deficit rules. This is no idle threat. The \uc2 ECB\uc2  basically forced Berlusconi out of office back in 2011 by allowing Italy's borrowing costs to soar after he ignored their strongly worded letter, well, suggesting he cut the budget. All the center-left can do, then, is say it would do a better or more compassionate job pushing through the tough cuts and reforms that Europe wants. Austerity with a human face, though, isn't much of a platform.\par \par \uc2 This means that euro zone politics usually goes something like this. First, the center-left and center-right take turns discrediting themselves by following the unpopular policies that the E.U.'s budgetary rules require. Then a new party of the left \u8212\'20\'14 sometimes more populist, other times more centrist \u8212\'20\'14 gets a chance in office after it promises that it can change things. Except it can't. Not unless it's willing to take the country out of the euro, and, in the process, set off the mother-of-all financial crises. It's at this point that the far-right becomes a threat. It rails against the way the E.U. forces them to accept refugees and won't let them spend as much money on "real" Italians or French people or what have you. It's been enough to send them near the top of the polls but not actually form a government. That's because the other parties have teamed up, like they did in France last year, to keep the far-right out of power.\par \par \uc2 The problem, though, is that might not always be possible \u8212\'20\'14 especially in Italy. The Five Star Movement and the League control just over half the seats in the new parliament, and the other parties are too ideologically antagonistic to probably even form a minority government. So the next government will need at least one of these populist parties in its coalition, which, considering that the Five Star Movement has historically ruled out joining any, probably means that the League will be in charge.\par \par \uc2 Empowering xenophobes wasn't exactly what the E.U. had in mind when it set out on its goal of "ever closer union" 60 years ago. The idea of Europe was supposed to cure, or at least temper, nationalism, not cause it. But it won't work as long as they make it impossible for the center-left to offer up an alternative vision to the far-right other than doing what Brussels says in the most efficient way possible.\par \par \uc2 That's a pretty big oops.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020180312ee3c0030d\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

It's bad policy, and it'll cost them. ; Their position won't play well in flyover America.\b0\par\par\uc2 By Ed Rogers \par \uc2 764 \uc2 words\par \uc2 7 March 2018\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2018, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Attorney General Jeff Sessions and the Trump administration are going about the sanctuary city issue in the right way. The very idea of so-called sanctuary cities is offensive to a lot of law-abiding Americans. Taking action against the liberal politicians who want to give safe harbor to illegal immigrants is a slow, easy pitch from the Democrats, and Republicans everywhere should take advantage.\par \par \uc2 The Justice Department is now challenging several laws in California that not only interfere with the nation's immigration policies but also place American citizens and law enforcement personnel at risk. The idea that laws can be ignored and that state and local politicians can affirmatively warn lawbreakers of how to escape apprehension is incredible. It is indefensible. We either have laws, or we don't. And if our elected leaders don't want to uphold the law, they can either change them or resign. The law is not optional once you have made a pledge to uphold the duties of your office.\par \par \uc2 Open-border radicals in California and other liberal strongholds must be held accountable. Of course, liberals would have you believe that they are only interested in protecting the poor, the oppressed and the hardworking who have nowhere else to go. But in many cases, their actions allow dangerous and sometimes repeat criminals to be shielded from deportation or prison. In California, good Samaritans who value the rule of law are even prohibited from voluntarily cooperating with federal immigration officials who are trying to uphold the law and make communities safer.\par \par \uc2 Anyway, Democrats and their allies in the media will say otherwise, but nothing about this conversation is even in the slightest bit hyperbolic. Local politicians are actually warning illegal immigrants of impending enforcement actions. In Oakland, Mayor \uc2 Libby Schaaf\uc2  went so far as to issue a press release and accompanying tweet alerting illegal immigrants in the Bay Area of an impending \uc2 Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) \uc2 operation last month. According to ICE Deputy Director \uc2 Thomas D. Homan\uc2 , what the Oakland mayor did "is no better than a gang lookout yelling 'police' when a police cruiser comes in the neighborhood." The fact that a politician who presumably swore to uphold the Constitution could feel so emboldened to undermine an active law enforcement operation and place those officers in harm's way cannot go unanswered. And according to what Sessions said on Wednesday, it won't. Specifically, speaking before the California Peace Officers' Association, Sessions said: "We are going to fight these irrational, unfair, and unconstitutional policies that have been imposed on you and our federal officers. We are fighting to make your jobs safer and to help you reduce crime in America. We are fighting to have a lawful system of immigration that serves Americans. And we intend to win." Well said.\par \par \uc2 Republicans can only hope that liberals running in 2018 will make an issue of the Justice Department lawsuit. After all, do Democrats really want to be on the side of shielding illegal immigrants \u8212\'20\'14 many of whom have outstanding warrants and criminal records? When the Oakland mayor alerted an entire community of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  criminals that ICE was coming, she reportedly allowed about 800 to escape. According to ICE officials, almost half of those who were arrested "had prior felony convictions for serious or violent offenses, such as child sex crimes, weapons charges and assault, or had past convictions for significant or multiple misdemeanors." Are those really the people Democrats want to defend? I hope so. I can already see the campaign ads that Republicans will be running. The Democrats' position on sanctuary cities will not play well in flyover America.\par \par \uc2 Last month, plenty of Democrats and liberal outlets pushed the idea that somehow, in some bizarre twist of reality, Republicans had split with law enforcement and were no longer the party of law and order. The Huffington Post even pronounced that Republicans had "unleashed an extraordinary attack on law enforcement" by criticizing a few senior \uc2 FBI\uc2  officials. With the Democrats' position on sanctuary cities, that argument should not be too difficult to dismiss. Anyone who supports illegal aliens and opposes law enforcement's efforts to protect communities from criminals should be shown no quarter \u8212\'20\'14 not in the media, not in the courtroom and not in our political campaigns. In the case of the administration's policy on sanctuary cities, good policy is also the best politics.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020180307ee37006vd\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

"Do something!"\b0\par\par\uc2 By Emily Yahr \par \uc2 936 \uc2 words\par \uc2 16 February 2018\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2018, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 On Thursday night, ABC's Jimmy Kimmel delivered another tearful monologue after another mass shooting, a day after 17 people were killed at a high school in Parkland, Fla.\par \par \uc2 "Children are being murdered," Kimmel said, getting choked up as he addressed President Trump with a plea to address gun control. "Do something! We still haven't even talked about it. You still haven't done anything about it. You've literally done nothing."\par \par \uc2 The late-night host \u8212\'20\'14 the only one who wasn't preempted this week for the Olympics \u8212\'20\'14 gave a similar emotional speech in October after the Las Vegas massacre at the Route 91 Harvest festival.\par \par \uc2 Here's a transcript of Kimmel's remarks from Thursday:\par \par \uc2 As I'm sure you know and feel, this is another very sad day in America. Another senseless shooting. This time at a high school in Parkland, Florida, where a gunman, a former student, opened fire yesterday again. Seventeen lives have been lost, more than a dozen people have been hospitalized. And our president, as he should, weighed in on the tragic events this morning from the White House.\par \par \uc2 Footage of Trump: "We are all joined together as one American family. And your suffering is our burden also. No child, no teacher, should ever be in danger in an American school. No parent should ever have to fear for their sons and daughters when they kiss them goodbye in the morning."\par \par \uc2 Agreed. So I agree with both of those statements. And here's what you do to fix that: Tell your buddies in Congress, tell Paul Ryan and \uc2 Mitch McConnell\uc2  and Marco Rubio, all the family men who care so much about their communities, that what we need are laws, real laws, that do everything possible to keep assault rifles out of the hands of people who are going to shoot our kids. Go on TV and tell them to do that.\par \par \uc2 I'll tell you something. That is a perfect example of the common sense you told us you were going to bring to the White House. It's time to bring it, we need it. Tell these congressmen and lobbyists who infest that swamp you said you were going to drain, force these allegedly Christian men and women who stuff their pockets with money from the \uc2 NRA\uc2  year after year after year to do something. Now. Not later. Now.\par \par \uc2 And don't you dare let anyone say it's too soon to be talking about it, because you said it after Vegas, you said it after Sandy Hook, you say that after every one of these eight now fatal school shootings we had in this country this year. Children are being murdered.\par \par \uc2 Do something! We still haven't even talked about it. You still haven't done anything about it. You've literally done nothing. Actually, you've done worse than nothing. You like to say this is a mental health issue, but one of your very first acts as president, Mr. Trump, was to actually roll back the regulations that were designed to keep firearms out of the hands of the mentally ill. You did that. Your party voted to repeal the mandates on coverage for mental health.\par \par \uc2 So I agree, this is a mental illness issue. Because if you don't think we need to do something about it, you're obviously mentally ill.\par \par \uc2 It is amazing to me that if one \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  causes a car accident, we've got to build a wall to keep the rest of them out. Why are you looking for solutions to that problem and not this one? Every reasonable American, Republican or Democrat, knows that something has to be done. Something. And we're not doing anything. But go ahead, I'll let you finish.\par \par \uc2 Footage of Trump: To every parent, teacher, and child who is hurting so badly, we are here for you, whatever you need, whatever we can do, to ease your pain."\par \par \uc2 Great. Okay. What we need and what you can do to ease our pain and to prevent future pain is something. Eight out of 10 Americans agree that a teenager shouldn't have an AR-15. So why does a teenager legally have an AR-15? Somewhere along the line, these guys forgot they work for us, not the \uc2 NRA\uc2 . Us. And this time we're not going to allow you to bow your head in prayer for two weeks, until you get an all-clear and we move on to the next thing. We're going to make sure you do something this time.\par \par \uc2 Kimmel concluded as he told his viewers that if they agree with him, they should write to their representatives \u8212\'20\'14 and vote them out if they didn't listen. He then aired a brief montage of politicians and commentators explaining it was "premature" to discuss gun legislation, and ended with a clip of Trump saying, "This isn't a guns situation. We could go into it, but it's a little bit soon to go into it."\par \par \uc2 "Yeah, no," Kimmel said. "It isn't."\par \par \uc2 Read more:\par \par \uc2 FBI\uc2 's near-brush with suspect in Florida school shooting draws scrutiny\par \par \uc2 Despite preparations, no one was ready for what happened at Douglas High\par \par \uc2 A loud, new voice after the latest school shooting: Kids wanting to know why adults hadn't done more\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020180216ee2g001md\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Indianapolis Colts linebacker Edwin Jackson and his Uber driver were killed early Sunday morning when a car driven by an allegedly intoxicated man plowed into them on an Indianapolis interstate while they were pulled over on the shoulder. The driver, identified as Manuel Orrego-Savala, is a citizen of Guatemala; Indiana State Police said he was in the country illegally and had twice been deported.\par \par \uc2 On Tuesday, President Trump used the incident to call for tougher immigration polices.\par \par \uc2 So disgraceful that a person illegally in our country killed @Colts linebacker Edwin Jackson. This is just one of many such preventable tragedies. We must get the Dems to get tough on the Border, and with illegal immigration, FAST!\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 6, 2018\par \par \uc2 He also sent out a sympathy tweet to Jackson's family minutes later:\par \par \uc2 My prayers and best wishes are with the family of Edwin Jackson, a wonderful young man whose life was so senselessly taken. @Colts\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 6, 2018\par \par \uc2 On Wednesday, the Marion County prosecutor's office charged Orrego-Savala with two counts of failure to remain at the scene of an accident and two counts tied to drunken driving causing death, all of them felonies. After the charges were announced, Marion County prosecutor Terry Curry lambasted the president for turning the deaths of two people into a political issue.\par \par \uc2 "We are disheartened that ghoulish and inappropriate public commentary has politicized this tragedy," Curry, a Democrat, said via the Indianapolis Star. "Much of such commentary, including tweets by the president, fails to acknowledge that both Edwin Jackson and Jeffrey Monroe lost their lives on Sunday. We will simply seek justice on behalf of the families of those two victims."\par \par \uc2 Trump wasn't the first politician to issue a statement decrying the incident in such a way.\par \par \uc2 "The loss of life at the hands of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  criminals should make all Hoosiers sad and ultimately angry," U.S. Rep. Todd Rokita (R-Ind.) said in a statement released Monday. "We must do more to get these dangerous \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  criminals off of our streets, and guarantee this never happens again by building a wall, ending sanctuary cities, and stopping illegal immigration once and for all."\par \par \uc2 Sen. Joe Donnelly\uc2  (D-Ind.) on Tuesday said Orrego-Savala should not have been allowed back in the country.\par \par \uc2 Joe's statement mourning the deaths of @Colts linebacker Edwin Jackson and Hoosier Jeffrey Monroe: pic.twitter.com/ejMa7iIQ0w\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 Senator \uc2 Joe Donnelly\uc2  (@SenDonnelly) February 6, 2018\par \par \uc2 Jackson's roommate, Chad Bouchez, told \uc2 CBS News\uc2  that Jackson would not have wanted his death to be politicized.\par \par \uc2 "Absolutely not. He would not want that," Bouchez said. "I don't think Edwin would have judged anyone on where they were from or anything else."\par \par \uc2 Police say Orrego-Savala, 37, had a blood alcohol level nearly three times the legal limit when he crashed his Ford F-150 truck into Jackson and Jeffrey Monroe, Jackson's Uber driver, around 4 a.m. local time Sunday. Monroe had pulled over because Jackson was feeling ill after a night on the town.\par \par \uc2 "[Jackson] actually did the right thing and he took an Uber," Bouchez said. "He was making the right steps to get home safely and not put anyone else in harm's way."\par \par \uc2 An \uc2 Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2  spokeswoman told the Indianapolis Star that Orrego-Savala first entered the country sometime in 2004. The next year, he was convicted of driving under the influence in Redwood City, Calif. Orrego-Savala then was removed from the country by ICE in both 2007 and 2009; it's unknown when he reentered the United States and came to Indiana.\par \par \uc2 In the wake of the crash, Orrego-Savala also faces federal charges over his illegal reentry into the country as a previously deported person.\par \par \uc2 Read more from The Post:\par \par \uc2 Super Bowl LII had fewest viewers since 2009, down 7 percent from last year\par \par \uc2 Kevin Hart got drunk, tried to crash the Eagles' Super Bowl celebration and cursed on NFL Network\par \par \uc2 'They gave up on me': Patriots' Malcolm Butler laments surprise Super Bowl benching\par \par \uc2 'I'm not a loser anymore': Eagles' Super Bowl celebration brings catharsis amid some chaos\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020180206ee26003s5\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

Bruce Rauner (R) was so loaded some thought it was a parody.\b0\par\par\uc2 By Derek Hawkins \par \uc2 1,104 \uc2 words\par \uc2 5 February 2018\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2018, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 In political campaigns, negative advertisements tend to trade on controversy and exaggeration. But a new ad out of Illinois is so inflammatory that a bipartisan group of state officials is blasting it as bigoted and calling for it to be taken down, while others appear to have mistaken it for some sort of parody.\par \par \uc2 The ad from state \uc2 Rep. Jeanne Ives\uc2 , a Republican mounting a primary challenge to Gov. Bruce Rauner (R), is a mocking thank-you message to the governor, who has faced criticism from some conservatives who consider him too moderate on certain issues.\par \par \uc2 The one-minute segment opens with a shot of several smiling people. Among them is a man with a faint five o'clock shadow wearing a dress and carrying a purse. "Thank you for signing legislation that lets me use the girls' bathroom," the deep-voiced actor says.\par \par \uc2 Next comes a woman wearing one of the pink hats associated with the Women's March. "Thank you for making all Illinois families pay for my abortions," she says.\par \par \uc2 The video then cuts to a man clad in a black-hooded sweatshirt, his mouth covered by a red bandanna, an apparent nod to the masked anarchist protesters that have wreaked havoc at conservative events in the past year. "Thank you," he mockingly tells the governor, "for opposing law enforcement and making Illinois a sanctuary state for \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  criminals."\par \par \uc2 After that, a black woman in a teacher's union T-shirt "thanks" Rauner for purportedly making the state "bail out Chicago teacher pensions." The segment ends with a series of clips accusing the governor of "betraying" Republicans.\par \par \uc2 There are still nine months to go until the 2018 midterms, but the ad seemed to signal some of the nastiness that could be in store as campaigns around the country heat up and Election Day approaches.\par \par \uc2 When the video was first published Friday by the Illinois political blog Capitol Fax, some Ives supporters suggested that it was a fabrication, as \uc2 Politico\uc2  reported. One Capitol Fax reader commented that the ad "only makes sense in a world where" the governor and one of Ives's strategists "are false-flagging to make Rauner more electable in the general."\par \par \uc2 A chorus of politicians and advocacy groups promptly issued denunciations. Tim Schneider, chairman of the Illinois Republican Party, called on Ives to pull the segment, saying it was a "cowardly attempt to stoke political division."\par \par \uc2 "There is no place in the Illinois Republican Party for rhetoric that attacks our fellow Illinoisans based on their race, gender or humanity," Schneider said in a statement Saturday. "Rep. Ives' campaign ad does not reflect who we are as the Party of Lincoln and as proud residents of our great and diverse state."\par \par \uc2 Pat Brady, a former state GOP chairman, added on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 : "There is no room in the Republican Party for racist, bigoted, homophobic candidates like her."\par \par \uc2 This is the @JeanneIves and @DanProft we have known for years. There is no room in the Republican Party for racist, bigoted, homophobic candidates like her. We are better than @JeanneIves #twill {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://t.co/f7Sdq2g4Us"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://t.co/f7Sdq2g4Us}}}\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 Pat Brady (@pat_brady) February 2, 2018\par \par \uc2 Despite the outcry, Ives's campaign stood by the ad, contending that it was a "fair and accurate representation of the implications" of the governor's policy choices.\par \par \uc2 "Rauner betrayed Illinois conservatives. He and his paid-for mouthpieces don't like his betrayals being illustrated and his radical left-wing social agenda being exposed," Ives campaign spokeswoman Kathleen Murphy told the Associated Press. "Rauner is the one who owes Illinois families in general and conservatives in particular an apology."\par \par \uc2 Some Illinois conservatives also defended Ives and the ad, as \uc2 Politico\uc2  reported. "In an age of ambiguity in politics, it's a clear, unambiguous message about what Rauner stands for," John McGlasson, a member of the Republican Party's state central committee, said in a statement through the Ives campaign. "Everything in the video is correct."\par \par \uc2 Ives will face Rauner in the March 20 primary. She's trailing the governor by more than 40 percentage points, according to a poll We Ask America conducted in mid-January. About 65 percent of respondents said they would vote for Rauner in the GOP primary, while about 21 percent said they would vote for Ives. Fifteen percent were undecided, according to the poll.\par \par \uc2 Ives, a three-term lawmaker from Wheaton, began her gubernatorial bid after Rauner angered conservatives by signing legislation allowing taxpayer-funded abortions for people on Medicaid and state employee health plans, as the Associated Press reported.\par \par \uc2 Hard-line social conservatives were also rankled when Rauner approved a measure permitting transgender people to change the sex listed on their birth certificate with the authorization of a medical professional, according to the \uc2 Chicago Tribune\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The assertions about law enforcement and illegal immigrants in Ives's ad were a reference to legislation Rauner signed into law last year that barred law enforcement officers from detaining people solely on the basis of their immigration status. The \uc2 Tribune\uc2  noted that major law enforcement groups supported the measure.\par \par \uc2 State officials and advocacy groups on the left also sounded off on Ives's ad over the weekend.\par \par \uc2 "While \uc2 Bruce Rauner\uc2  needs to be defeated in this election, this type of hate has no place in our politics," Galia Slayen, a spokeswoman for Democratic gubernatorial candidate \uc2 J.B. Pritzker\uc2 , said in a statement to the State Journal-Register. "As governor, J.B. will defend our communities from forces of hate and ensure Illinois remains a welcome state to all."\par \par \uc2 Brian C. Johnson, chief executive of Equality Illinois, added: "We need a governor who will stand up for all Illinoisans, not someone who will target transgender Illinoisans for her personal political benefit."\par \par \uc2 The ad wasn't the only controversy to hit the Ives campaign over the weekend. On Sunday, the campaign's \uc2 Twitter\uc2  account retweeted a supportive message from a man whose account contained anti-Semitic posts. The man said he donated $1,000 Ives's primary bid. The campaign deleted the retweet and vowed to give any money back, saying, "We repudiate him."\par \par \uc2 We had a staffer re-tweet this message without realizing who this individual was. It has been removed. We repudiate him. Disavow any endorsement and are returning any contribution. #twill. {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://t.co/H9odacvcHB"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://t.co/H9odacvcHB}}}\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 \uc2 Jeanne Ives\uc2  (@JeanneIves) February 4, 2018\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020180205ee25002gz\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The Justice Department on Wednesday escalated its attempt to crack down on so-called "sanctuary" jurisdictions, threatening to subpoena 23 states, cities and other localities that have policies the department suspects might be unlawfully interfering with immigration enforcement.\par \par \uc2 President Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions have long promised to target places with policies friendly to those in the country illegally \u8212\'20\'14 warning they might withhold federal money from some and trying to tie grant eligibility to cooperation with federal authorities on immigration matters. The Justice Department had previously contacted the 23 jurisdictions threatened Wednesday, raising worries they might be in violation of a federal law barring places from enacting policies that block communication with \uc2 Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 In a new letter, Bureau of Justice Assistance Director Jon Adler said officials remained "concerned" that the places had policies that violate the law, even after their previous responses. He asked for a new bevy of documents \u8212\'20\'14 including "any orders, directives, instructions, or guidance to your law enforcement employees" \u8212\'20\'14 and said the department would subpoena the materials if necessary.\par \par \uc2 That threat escalates the department's effort, as it could have the courts compelling jurisdictions to turn over documents that they didn't provide voluntarily.\par \par \uc2 "I continue to urge all jurisdictions under review to reconsider policies that place the safety of their communities and their residents at risk," Sessions said in a statement. "Protecting criminal aliens from federal immigration authorities defies common sense and undermines the rule of law. We have seen too many examples of the threat to public safety represented by jurisdictions that actively thwart the federal government's immigration enforcement \u8212\'20\'14 enough is enough."\par \par \uc2 Among those jurisdictions in the crosshairs are Chicago, New York City, Los Angeles and the states of California, Illinois and Oregon. In total, the 23 jurisdictions received more than $39 million in fiscal year 2016 money from the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program \u8212\'20\'14 which Sessions is now threatening to put at risk.\par \par \uc2 Local leaders criticized the move. New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu (D), president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, said he would skip a planned White House meeting on infrastructure because of it. "An attack on one of our cities mayors who are following the constitution is an attack on all of us," he said. His city was not among those targeted Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 New York City Mayor \uc2 Bill de Blasio\uc2  similarly wrote on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  he would skip the gathering after Trump's Justice Department "decided to renew their racist assault on our immigrant communities. It doesn't make us safer and it violates America's core values."\par \par \uc2 Chicago Mayor \uc2 Rahm Emanuel\uc2  (D) said officers in his city endeavor to build trust with residents to reduce public safety threats, and "you cannot do that if you drive a wedge between any immigrant community and the law enforcement." He said Sessions's threats were "amazing" in that the attorney general seemed to "disregard what the court system has already said uniformly from coast to coast."\par \par \uc2 White House Press Secretary \uc2 Sarah Huckabee Sanders\uc2  said: "The White House has been very clear that we don't support sanctuary cities. We support enforcing the law and following the law, and that is the Department of Justice's job is to do exactly that, and if mayors have a problem with that, they should talk to Congress."\par \par \uc2 Much of this crackdown has been stymied by the courts. A federal judge in California last year blocked Trump's executive order to cut funding to such places, and a federal judge in Chicago ruled that Sessions had exceeded his authority in imposing new conditions, such as requiring recipients to give immigration authorities access to jails and 48 hours notice when suspected illegal immigrants are to be released. A federal judge in Philadelphia also ruled that city was in compliance with the law and blocked the Justice Department from withholding money. The Justice Department has appealed all those cases.\par \par \uc2 Sessions, too, has issued guidance that defines sanctuary cities narrowly \u8212\'20\'14 essentially as only those places that don't comply with the particular federal law that stops places from blocking communication with \uc2 Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2 . Justice Department officials believe they can still link federal money to compliance with that law \u8212\'20\'14 as the Obama administration did \u8212\'20\'14 on grants where it already was required.\par \par \uc2 Some targeted cities, though, have said in the past they are following that law, and what counts as compliance is up for debate. California Attorney General \uc2 Xavier Becerra\uc2  said Wednesday, for example, that his state \u8212\'20\'14 which recently became a sanctuary state \u8212\'20\'14 already complied with all federal law and would "continue to try to be as responsive as we can to any requests from the federal government."\par \par \uc2 A senior Justice Department official said at a briefing for reporters that local jails should notify immigration authorities when a suspected \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  is released from a jail, even though the judge in Chicago said Sessions could not impose the new condition of a 48-hour advance notice.\par \par \uc2 The senior Justice Department official said that the department wants more documents \u8212\'20\'14 beyond the cities' legal analysis for why they are following the law \u8212\'20\'14 to evaluate whether grant money should be withheld. The department has yet to issue money to Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program recipients for fiscal year 2017 \u8212\'20\'14 which the official said was due at least in part to the legal wrangling over sanctuary cities.\par \par \uc2 Sessions has long sought to tie crime to immigration \u8212\'20\'14 recently releasing data, which experts said was misleading, that said 73 percent of terrorism convictions in the U.S. involved individuals from other countries. Determining a link between illegal immigration and other crime is statistically difficult to do, though some research shows that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than those who are native born. Civil liberties and immigration advocates, too, note there is irony in Sessions threatening to withhold law enforcement grants in the name of fighting crime.\par \par \uc2 matt.zapotosky@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020180124ee1o004v4\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

Foes' linguistic rift complicates debate on immigration\b0\par\par\uc2 David Nakamura \par \uc2 1,233 \uc2 words\par \uc2 22 January 2018\par \uc2 The Washington Post\par \uc2 WP\par \uc2 FINAL\par A07\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2018, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved \par \par \uc2 Lars Larson, a conservative radio host in Portland, Ore., who supports President Trump, uses the phrase "illegal aliens" on his nationally syndicated talk show to describe immigrants living in the country unlawfully.\par \par \uc2 "I think it's a way to define a problem," Larson said. "We're a nation of laws."\par \par \uc2 Cecilia Mu\u241\'00\'F1oz\uc2 , a longtime immigrant rights advocate who served as President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 's domestic policy adviser, calls those words "pejorative" and prefers alternatives such as "undocumented immigrants."\par \par \uc2 "Aliens, in the public mind, are not a good thing," Mu\u241\'00\'F1oz said.\par \par \uc2 Their disagreement over how to describe an estimated population of 11 million people might seem like minor semantics in the tempestuous, decades-long debate over how to overhaul the nation's immigration system. But people on both sides say the yawning gap in language has come to symbolize - and directly contribute to - the inability of Congress and the general public to forge consensus. An impasse on immigration was at the center of the budget fight that led to a shutdown of the federal government Saturday.\par \par \uc2 Though Trump's use of a vulgarity in a recent immigration meeting at the White House drew widespread condemnation, more mundane terms have been weaponized by immigration hawks, and to a lesser degree advocacy groups, in pursuit of political advantage.\par \par \uc2 On the right, Trump and his allies have warned of the dangers of "chain migration," railed against "amnesty" for lawbreakers and urged a shift toward a "merit-based" system. Their choice of words suggests that immigrants are taking advantage of the United States and are a drain on society.\par \par \uc2 On the left, advocates have defended a tradition of "family reunification" and cast undocumented immigrants who arrived as children as "dreamers" and "kids" in need of special care - even though some are in their mid-30s. Their rhetoric paints immigrants as the fabric of the American experience and as strivers seeking a chance at success.\par \par \uc2 The starkly different terms show why it's so hard for Washington to agree on major immigration reform. For years, over several administrations, the two sides have accused each other of being unable or unwilling to accurately name the problem with a system they agree is broken.\par \par \uc2 "Who controls the parameters around language really has a lot of power in the debate," said Roberto Gonzales, a professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Education who specializes in immigration. "How do you frame an issue in a way that sways public opinion?"\par \par \uc2 Although disagreements over immigration terminology predate Trump's presidency, Gonzales said, the president's willingness to use extreme rhetoric in the name of undermining political correctness has exacerbated the problem and raised the stakes. Gonzales pointed to Trump's campaign against "chain migration" in the wake of a terrorist attack in New York in the fall in which the suspect, Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov, an immigrant from Uzbekistan, is charged with striking and killing eight people while driving a truck on a bike path.\par \par \uc2 The president falsely claimed that Saipov, a permanent legal resident who is not a citizen, had helped two dozen foreign-born relatives immigrate to the United States. In fact, there is no evidence he brought a single family member.\par \par \uc2 Advocates say Trump aims to cast aspersions on all immigrants, whether they are here legally or illegally, and that his repeated denunciations of "chain migration" are intended to advance policies to curb legal immigration channels - a longtime goal of Republican hard-liners and restrictionist groups.\par \par \uc2 The advocates use the term "family reunification" to describe the process of U.S. citizens petitioning for family members in limited categories - spouses, children, parents and siblings - to come here, a process that can take as long as 20 years. After changes were made to the immigration system in 1965, the family category has been responsible for about half of the roughly 1 million immigration visas the nation distributes each year.\par \par \uc2 But some newspapers and cable television stations have parroted Trump's use of "chain migration," often with limited context.\par \par \uc2 "It's a real problem," Gonzales said. "It's become so distorted. If you use a term in an incorrect or incendiary way enough times, people start using it that way."\par \par \uc2 Jose Antonio Vargas, chief executive of Define American, a media advocacy group that focuses on immigration coverage, said conservatives have deliberately "created this entire linguistic parallel reality that is framed by the language they use."\par \par \uc2 Vargas pointed to outlets such as Breitbart News, which supports Trump and - until this month - was overseen by his former White House chief strategist, \uc2 Stephen K. Bannon\uc2 . Breitbart published recent stories with headlines such as "Illegal Aliens Escalate Amnesty Demands" and "Anchor Baby Population in U.S. Exceeds One Year of American Births."\par \par \uc2 Define American has run a campaign, "Words Matter," that asks news organizations to commit to dropping what Vargas calls "dehumanizing" phrases, such as "\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 ." Although some major outlets, including the Associated Press, have complied, Vargas said progress has been slow. (The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2 's style guide permits use of the phrase but notes that some find it offensive.)\par \par \uc2 "The right has been so good at using language as a weapon," said Vargas, a former Post reporter who came out publicly in a 2011 \uc2 New York Times\uc2  article as an unauthorized immigrant from the Philippines. "Now we have gotten to the point where even legal immigration is a dirty word for people. That's how successful they've been."\par \par \uc2 Immigration hard-liners accuse advocacy groups of trying to discredit terms that have been considered mainstream for decades. The \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2 , for example, continues to use the phrases "illegal alien" and "criminal alien" in reports, news releases and tweets.\par \par \uc2 In 2014, after Congress failed to approve a comprehensive immigration bill, Obama used his executive authority to announce a deferred action program to shield up to 4 million undocumented parents of U.S. citizens from deportation by granting them renewable three-year work permits.\par \par \uc2 In making his announcement, Obama said the program was not "amnesty." His critics scoffed.\par \par \uc2 "Any time a politician says something is not really amnesty, what everyone hears is that this is an amnesty," said \uc2 Mark Krikorian\uc2 , executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates lower immigration levels. "It would be, politically, so much better for them to just say, 'Look, folks, I don't like it either, but we have a tax amnesty, we have a parking ticket amnesty, and sometimes we have to do it.' "\par \par \uc2 Larson, the radio host, said immigrant advocates are "lying to the public to try to make something sound good that is not. I don't say a bank robber is making undocumented withdrawals."\par \par \uc2 Enrique Gonzalez, a former aide to Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), said the warring terminology has further inflamed an already emotion-laden debate.\par \par \uc2 In 2013, Rubio voted in favor of a comprehensive immigration bill that offered a 13-year path to citizenship, telling conservative talk shows that the bill did not amount to amnesty. His stance engendered such fierce blowback from his base that Rubio ended up dropping his public support.\par \par \uc2 "It creates this hysteria where everyone is going to the far left or the far right," said Gonzalez, now an immigration lawyer in Miami. "The gap is growing wider and wider."\par \par \uc2 david.nakamura@washpost.com \par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com\par \par \uc2 WP20180122immigrationlanguage\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020180122ee1m00026\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Lars Larson, a conservative radio host in Portland, Ore., who supports President Trump, uses the phrase "illegal aliens" on his nationally syndicated talk show to describe immigrants living in the country unlawfully.\par \par \uc2 "I think it's a way to define a problem," Larson said. "We're a nation of laws."\par \par \uc2 Cecilia Mu\u241\'00\'F1oz\uc2 , a longtime immigrant rights advocate who served as President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 's domestic policy adviser, calls those words "pejorative" and prefers alternatives such as "undocumented immigrants."\par \par \uc2 "Aliens, in the public mind, are not a good thing," Mu\u241\'00\'F1oz said.\par \par \uc2 Their disagreement over how to describe an estimated population of 11\u8201\'20\'09million people might seem like minor semantics in the tempestuous, decades-long debate over how to overhaul the nation's immigration system. But people on both sides say the yawning gap in language has come to symbolize \u8212\'20\'14 and directly contribute to \u8212\'20\'14 the inability of Congress and the general public to forge consensus. An impasse on immigration was at the center of the budget fight that led to a shutdown of the federal government Saturday.\par \par \uc2 Though Trump's use of a vulgarity in a recent immigration meeting at the White House drew widespread condemnation, more mundane terms have been weaponized by immigration hawks, and to a lesser degree advocacy groups, in pursuit of political advantage.\par \par \uc2 On the right, Trump and his allies have warned of the dangers of "chain migration," railed against "amnesty" for lawbreakers and urged a shift toward a "merit-based" system. Their choice of words suggests that immigrants are taking advantage of the United States and are a drain on society.\par \par \uc2 On the left, advocates have defended a tradition of "family reunification" and cast undocumented immigrants who arrived as children as "dreamers" and "kids" in need of special care \u8212\'20\'14 even though some are in their mid-30s. Their rhetoric paints immigrants as the fabric of the American experience and as strivers seeking a chance at success.\par \par \uc2 The starkly different terms show why it's so hard for Washington to agree on major immigration reform. For years, over several administrations, the two sides have accused each other of being unable or unwilling to accurately name the problem with a system they agree is broken.\par \par \uc2 "Who controls the parameters around language really has a lot of power in the debate," said Roberto Gonzales, a professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Education who specializes in immigration. "How do you frame an issue in a way that sways public opinion?"\par \par \uc2 Although disagreements over immigration terminology predate Trump's presidency, Gonzales said, the president's willingness to use extreme rhetoric in the name of undermining political correctness has exacerbated the problem and raised the stakes. Gonzales pointed to Trump's campaign against "chain migration" in the wake of a terrorist attack in New York in the fall in which the suspect, Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov, an immigrant from Uzbekistan, is charged with striking and killing eight people while driving a truck on a bike path.\par \par \uc2 The president falsely claimed that Saipov, a permanent legal resident who is not a citizen, had helped two dozen foreign-born relatives immigrate to the United States. In fact, there is no evidence he brought a single family member.\par \par \uc2 Advocates say Trump aims to cast aspersions on all immigrants, whether they are here legally or illegally, and that his repeated denunciations of "chain migration" are intended to advance policies to curb legal immigration channels \u8212\'20\'14 a longtime goal of Republican hard-liners and restrictionist groups.\par \par \uc2 The advocates use the term "family reunification" to describe the process of U.S. citizens petitioning for family members in limited categories \u8212\'20\'14 spouses, children, parents and siblings \u8212\'20\'14 to come here, a process that can take as long as 20 years. After changes were made to the immigration system in 1965, the family category has been responsible for about half of the roughly 1\u8201\'20\'09million immigration visas the nation distributes each year.\par \par \uc2 But some newspapers and cable television stations have parroted Trump's use of "chain migration," often with limited context.\par \par \uc2 "It's a real problem," Gonzales said. "It's become so distorted. If you use a term in an incorrect or incendiary way enough times, people start using it that way."\par \par \uc2 Jose Antonio Vargas, chief executive of Define American, a media advocacy group that focuses on immigration coverage, said conservatives have deliberately "created this entire linguistic parallel reality that is framed by the language they use."\par \par \uc2 Vargas pointed to outlets such as Breitbart News, which supports Trump and \u8212\'20\'14 until this month \u8212\'20\'14 was overseen by his former White House chief strategist, \uc2 Stephen K. Bannon\uc2 . Breitbart published recent stories with headlines such as "Illegal Aliens Escalate Amnesty Demands" and "Anchor Baby Population in U.S. Exceeds One Year of American Births."\par \par \uc2 Define American has run a campaign, "Words Matter," that asks news organizations to commit to dropping what Vargas calls "dehumanizing" phrases, such as "\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 ." Although some major outlets, including the Associated Press, have complied, Vargas said progress has been slow. (The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2 's style guide permits use of the phrase but notes that some find it offensive.)\par \par \uc2 "The right has been so good at using language as a weapon," said Vargas, a former Post reporter who came out publicly in a 2011 \uc2 New York Times\uc2  article as an unauthorized immigrant from the Philippines. "Now we have gotten to the point where even legal immigration is a dirty word for people. That's how successful they've been."\par \par \uc2 Immigration hard-liners accuse advocacy groups of trying to discredit terms that have been considered mainstream for decades. The \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2 , for example, continues to use the phrases "illegal alien" and "criminal alien" in reports, news releases and tweets.\par \par \uc2 In 2014, after Congress failed to approve a comprehensive immigration bill, Obama used his executive authority to announce a deferred action program to shield up to 4\u8201\'20\'09million undocumented parents of U.S. citizens from deportation by granting them renewable three-year work permits.\par \par \uc2 In making his announcement, Obama said the program was not "amnesty." His critics scoffed.\par \par \uc2 "Any time a politician says something is not really amnesty, what everyone hears is that this is an amnesty," said \uc2 Mark Krikorian\uc2 , executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates lower immigration levels. "It would be, politically, so much better for them to just say, 'Look, folks, I don't like it either, but we have a tax amnesty, we have a parking ticket amnesty, and sometimes we have to do it.'\u8201\'20\'09"\par \par \uc2 Larson, the radio host, said immigrant advocates are "lying to the public to try to make something sound good that is not. I don't say a bank robber is making undocumented withdrawals."\par \par \uc2 Enrique Gonzalez, a former aide to Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), said the warring terminology has further inflamed an already \u173\'00\'ADemotion-laden debate.\par \par \uc2 In 2013, Rubio voted in favor of a comprehensive immigration bill that offered a 13-year path to citizenship, telling conservative talk shows that the bill did not amount to amnesty. His stance engendered such fierce blowback from his base that Rubio ended up dropping his public support.\par \par \uc2 "It creates this hysteria where everyone is going to the far left or the far right," said Gonzalez, now an immigration lawyer in Miami. "The gap is growing wider and wider."\par \par \uc2 david.nakamura@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020180121ee1l001xh\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 ATLANTA \u8212\'20\'14 As he hands each person the Communion wafer, the priest watches his congregants walk back to their seats. They drop to their knees and bow their heads. Hands clasp. Around the church, a tear runs down a cheek, then another, then another.\par \par \uc2 The priest knows the prayers behind the faces of these undocumented immigrants, whom it is his special mission to serve. It's a prayer he shares: Se\u241\'00\'F1or Jes\u250\'00\'FAs, please don't make us leave the United States.\par \par \uc2 The Rev. Rey Pineda is a DACA recipient. He's one of nearly 690,000 young adults granted temporary authorization to stay legally in the country that they were brought to as children \u8212\'20\'14 the only publicly identified DACA recipient who has used the authorization to become a Catholic priest.\par \par \uc2 Across the country, "dreamers" such as Pineda, 29, are at the center of a debate so contentious that it threatens to shut down the government. One side believes that anyone who broke the law to come here in the first place doesn't belong here now. The other side believes in granting a chance to people who came here as children and are now enmeshed in American communities.\par \par \uc2 The same debate is simmering at Pineda's Atlanta parish, where he leads a congregation of thousands of Hispanic immigrants and thousands of conservative white Southerners. It's a conflict about principles, such as fairness and culture, and welcome and security, and forgiveness.\par \par \uc2 But it's also a conflict about what should become of their priest.\par \par \uc2 From undocumented to ordained\par \par \uc2 As Pineda sees it, the same desperate journey that made him an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  at the age of 2 is also what made him a man called to serve God.\par \par \uc2 After a car crash in Pineda's tiny home town in Mexico, his mother, Teresa, was in a coma; doctors told her husband that if she survived, she would never fully regain mental or physical function. Seeking help, the family somehow made it across the desert to Los Angeles \u8212\'20\'14 and, in Pineda's view, U.S. medical care was their first miracle.\par \par \uc2 The family stayed in the country and moved to Atlanta. Pineda picked up on the theme of God's saving grace in his story early on. "That kind of began to shape for me the awareness that we had survived a lot," he said. "It wasn't just due to my parents' own strength and perseverance, though that definitely had a lot to do with it."\par \par \uc2 By 16, he wanted to be a priest. At church, though, the priests he consulted told him that he could not become one of them because he was undocumented and could not legally work in the United States.\par \par \uc2 The church supported him as he pursued his calling anyway, first as a philosophy major at Southern Catholic College, then two more years in seminary. At that point, the vocations director sat him down to say that the church wouldn't ordain him because he was undocumented.\par \par \uc2 Pineda kept studying anyway, believing that somehow, God would provide a path to the priesthood. And then one appeared, in the form of an executive order. Then-President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  created Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals just in time for Pineda to become a priest.\par \par \uc2 Seeing an 'illegal' at the altar\par \par \uc2 The parish where Pineda works is one of Atlanta's stateliest \u8212\'20\'14 the Cathedral of Christ the King. Built on land that was once the national headquarters of the \uc2 Ku Klux Klan\uc2  before the cathedral's construction 80 years ago, the grand church is now home to a nearly 6,000-family congregation that is split racially and politically, much like North Georgia's 1.2 million Catholics and the Catholics of the nation.\par \par \uc2 White Catholics, who make up just under 60 percent of Catholics in America, lean strongly Republican \u8212\'20\'14 60 percent voted for President Trump, more than had voted for any Republican in the past 16 years, while 37 percent voted for \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 , according to \uc2 Pew Research Center\uc2  data.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, Latino Catholics, who made up 34 percent of American Catholics in 2014 and are growing in number, voted in opposite proportions: 67 percent for Clinton and 26 percent for Trump.\par \par \uc2 In September, when Trump canceled the DACA program that Obama created in 2012, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops decried the decision and called on Congress to pass legislation allowing dreamers to stay in the country. Last week, with the deadline to either strike a deal or shut down the government coming up this Friday, the bishops published their latest statement: "As a nation, we have a moral and humanitarian obligation to Dreamers."\par \par \uc2 But the words of the bishops don't dictate the political stances of the faithful. At Christ the King, where Pineda is one of three active priests, it seems that almost everyone in the English-speaking Masses routinely refers to immigrants as "illegals."\par \par \uc2 Many parishioners voted for Trump, who made his brash opposition to immigration the foremost position of his presidential campaign.\par \par \uc2 "I would build the wall," declares Andy Smith on Monday, right after sitting down with a cup of coffee from the cathedral kitchen that is named in his honor. Smith's photo is right there, in a frame, recognizing him for his dedicated service as the church sacristan. "We're a sovereign country. We have a right to protect our borders. I would end chain migration, and I would definitely do away with the lottery."\par \par \uc2 He's in agreement with the president, whose rhetoric Smith finds amusing.\par \par \uc2 But when it comes to immigrants who are already in the United States, and especially to DACA, Smith changes his tune. "They're taking care of business and their families, and they're already here. And the dreamers probably are the best of the lot. They're young. They're educated. Like Father Rey," he says.\par \par \uc2 The 79-year-old sacristan's embrace of the priest, and his leap from learning about the priest's status to supporting broader protections for the country's approximately 11 million undocumented immigrants, resembles the stories told by many church members.\par \par \uc2 Jackie Marcinko, a religion teacher in the school attached to the cathedral, doesn't like to talk about politics \u8212\'20\'14 she and her husband don't even tell each other who they've voted for, since she leans left and he leans right. But Pineda's status has shaken her to action. She wrote her first emails ever to a member of Congress, to urge both of Georgia's Republican senators to protect Dreamers. When she saw a friend tweet that DACA was illegal, she fired back a message. "This is hitting home for me," she recalls writing. "One of these dreamers is one of my priests."\par \par \uc2 When he first became a priest, Pineda thought his most important ministry would be working with immigrants like himself. That's a large part of his work at the cathedral. But after a year and a half at the cathedral, he thinks his work with families who have never met a dreamer is just as crucial.\par \par \uc2 "What God was asking of me was to work with the nonimmigrant community, to be able to spread some light on this issue and be able to hopefully change hearts," he says. "Putting a face to it, and also being their priest, is a good place to be."\par \par \uc2 Allen Kinzly, 35, became friends with the priest because of their shared enthusiasm for Atlanta United, the city's soccer team.\par \par \uc2 Kinzly had voted for Trump. He felt he would be better for the economy and the military than Clinton would. But now, he's a strong believer in protections for dreamers like his friend. "It is because of my relationship and my friendship with Father Rey," he says.\par \par \uc2 Flipping through photos on his phone, Kinzly, a video producer for the archdiocese's communications office, finds snapshots of Pineda hanging out one night after a soccer game. The priest, in a jersey and shorts instead of his clerical garb, suddenly grabbed the 20-foot-tall flagpole in the bed of Kinzly's red pickup, and waved the huge star-spangled banner through the air. Kinzly took photo after photo.\par \par \uc2 With four days left for Congress to work out a deal or shut down the government, Kinzly stared at the photos from that night. "He's just as American as me and you."\par \par \uc2 A priest who shares their struggle\par \par \uc2 Five miles away from the cathedral's stained-glass grandeur, the parish has a second location: the Mision de Cristo Rey, a converted warehouse.\par \par \uc2 When Pineda preaches at the Masses in Spanish that draw as many as 1,000 people each Sunday, his message is one of solidarity. Most of the churchgoers here are undocumented, or related to somebody who is.\par \par \uc2 "They all know I'm a dreamer," he says. "When we pray, when we're nervous about things that are happening in the government around us, I always, kind of tongue-in-cheek, remind them: 'Don't worry. If they come for you, they come for me.' "\par \par \uc2 The Catholic Church has been more cautious in offering direct aid to people at risk of deportation than some churches across the country, which have volunteered to be sanctuary spaces to protect people from immigration agents. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops has encouraged priests and lay leaders to support immigrant neighbors in such situations. But it's up to each bishop whether to declare their churches sanctuaries.\par \par \uc2 In Atlanta, Archbishop \uc2 Wilton Gregory\uc2  decided against it, saying the church couldn't guarantee that it would be able to shelter anyone from the law.\par \par \uc2 So the help that Pineda offers is mostly spiritual \u8212\'20\'14 a listening ear, a word of encouragement.\par \par \uc2 On Sunday, when he delivered a homily in Spanish after Trump's reported comments about immigrants from "shithole" countries, Pineda talked to the Latin American churchgoers about God's call to forgive. The offender might be our family or friends, he said. Or it might be "politicians who are vilifying us, making us look like the enemy of the people. Even he has to be loved. That is what the Lord asks us do to."\par \par \uc2 Arelis Hernandez took that to heart. After the Mass, she said she was trying to pray for Trump. It's hard, though. She's an undocumented immigrant, and although she tells customers at the clothing store she works in that they shouldn't worry about their immigration status, when she goes home at night she's terrified.\par \par \uc2 On bad days, she comes to Mass. "When I come here, I talk to God. It makes me more relaxed," she says. "Especially the priest, he says, 'Don't worry.' Especially Father Rey. He says: 'I am too.' He says: 'I am a dreamer.' "\par \par \uc2 Before leaving the mission, she turned toward the altar and crossed herself one more time, gathering strength for the journey ahead.\par \par \uc2 Chiqui Esteban contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 Want more stories about faith?

All Rights Reserved \par \par \uc2 The Democrat-controlled Senate was nearing a make-or-break vote on a comprehensive immigration bill in June 2013 when a pair of Republican senators swooped in with an 11th-hour amendment aimed at clinching enough GOP support to avoid a filibuster.\par \par \uc2 A key provision: doubling the length of a new border "fence" between the United States and Mexico from 350 miles to 700 miles.\par \par \uc2 Democrats didn't think such a barrier was necessary. Neither did the Obama White House. To them, the proposal seemed arbitrary - a random doubling of the size at the last minute for political purposes. In the end, though, all 54 Democrats in the Senate supported the provision in hopes of realizing a bigger goal - providing a path to citizenship for millions of undocumented immigrants.\par \par \uc2 This month, President Trump is ratcheting up demands that Congress include his wall in a package to provide legal status for hundreds of thousands of immigrants brought to the country illegally as children. The administration is preparing to ask for $18 billion over a decade to renovate and build 700 miles of wall along the southwest border, according to a memo from the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "We want a wall," Trump declared on Saturday after meeting with Republican leaders at Camp David in Maryland. "A wall must happen or we will not have" a deal.\par \par \uc2 Lawmakers face a March 5 deadline, set by Trump, after which work permits for the undocumented "dreamers" provided by former president \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program will begin to expire at a rate of nearly 1,000 per day.\par \par \uc2 But the debate illustrates how the political stakes have shifted since Trump took office.\par \par \uc2 Democrats, under pressure from immigrant rights groups, have strenuously opposed including Trump's wall in the negotiations. They call it a waste of taxpayer money, but they also have signaled that the political price for helping the president make good on his prime campaign promise is far too high.\par \par \uc2 Trump, through his anti- \uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2  rhetoric and policies, including a travel ban aimed at Muslim-majority countries, has made the wall a metaphor to many Democrats of an administration whose crackdown on immigration they say has overtones of xenophobia or racism.\par \par \uc2 "The debate over a wall goes back decades. The notion of a wall is a giant symbol that is not based on analysis in any way of whether we should do something about the border," said \uc2 Cecilia Mu\u241\'00\'F1oz\uc2 , a longtime immigrant rights advocate who served as Obama's domestic policy adviser. "The fact is, having elevated the notion of a wall in his campaign the way he did, the president made it an even bigger symbol than it already was - and that makes it much harder to accomplish."\par \par \uc2 In a letter to colleagues Friday, House Minority Leader \uc2 Nancy Pelosi\uc2  (D-Calif.) called the Trump administration's request for wall funding "alarming" and said her caucus "must all speak out."\par \par \uc2 On the other side of the debate, wall proponents are perplexed why Democrats are voicing such vociferous opposition.\par \par \uc2 In 2006, President \uc2 George W. Bush\uc2  signed into law the Secure Fence Act, a bill that authorized the construction of hundreds of miles of fencing along the border. That legislation was approved with broad bipartisan support, including, in the Senate, by such Democratic luminaries as \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  (Ill.), \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  (N.Y.), \uc2 Joe Biden\uc2  (Del.) and \uc2 Charles E. Schumer\uc2  (N.Y.), now the Senate minority leader.\par \par \uc2 "Where I don't understand the pushback is, in 2013 if everybody was for the 700 miles of double fencing, but now they're not for it because Trump calls it a wall - to me that does not make sense," said Brandon Judd, president of the National Border Patrol Council, the labor union for the Border Patrol agents. "Whether we call it a fence or call it a wall, it acts as the exact same thing - a physical barrier that makes it more difficult to enter the United States illegally. I don't understand the whole fight over this."\par \par \uc2 In a statement, Schumer said: "We'd be glad to do comprehensive immigration reform, like the Senate bill from 2013, that has more of what both sides want, but that will take time. There is an immediate need to protect the DACA recipients, so the deal will be more narrow than that."\par \par \uc2 It's not just the wall that has scrambled the debate. Trump also is demanding changes to the nation's legal immigration system, including curbing what the president calls "chain migration" - the practice of immigrants petitioning for extended family members to enter the country - and terminating a diversity visa lottery that provides 55,000 green cards to people from countries with low immigration rates to the United States.\par \par \uc2 The 2013 immigration bill approved by the Senate - with 14 Republicans joining the 54 Democrats - included provisions to end that lottery and to eliminate the ability of brothers and sisters of U.S. citizens to enter the country on family reunification visas. That bill also created a new category of "merit-based" visas in which prospective immigrants were awarded points for education levels and work expertise - another concept Trump has championed.\par \par \uc2 Democrats insist it is not fair to compare the 2013 debate with the current one. Five years ago, the negotiations were aimed at a far more sweeping comprehensive bill to fix an immigration system both parties agreed was broken. That legislation included changes to worker visas, cleared lengthy backlogs in legal immigration waiting lists, and offered a path to citizenship for all of the nation's estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants.\par \par \uc2 This year, the debate centers on the fate of a far smaller group. Nearly 700,000 dreamers were enrolled in the DACA program, started by Obama in 2012, when Trump terminated it in September. Not all dreamers had applied for the program, however, and all told, depending on how the group is defined, there could more than 1.5 million dreamers in the country, according to experts.\par \par \uc2 Democrats have eyed a Jan. 19 deadline for lawmakers to approve a must-pass spending bill as leverage to forge a narrow deal for some or all of this group.\par \par \uc2 Trump signaled last fall that, although he was adamant that lawmakers beef up border security, funding for a wall did not have to be tied to the dreamer issue. In recent months, however, the president has emphasized that any DACA legislation "must secure the border with a wall," as he reiterated Thursday.\par \par \uc2 Lawmakers remain uncertain about exactly what Trump is asking for. During the campaign, he called for a contiguous wall along 2,000 miles of the border, something even the Border Patrol union does not think is necessary.\par \par \uc2 After meeting with Trump at the White House on Thursday, Republican senators said such talk is misguided\par \par \uc2 Sen. Thom Tillis\uc2  (R-N.C.) said that despite the president's past campaign rhetoric, "he's listened to border security" experts and now believes "there's a need for walls and barriers in a number of places and the use of technology and personnel in others."\par \par \uc2 Ultimately, Tillis said, Republicans are hoping for "a net increase of 600 miles of wall. That will be varying barriers based on where you are along the border, but that's the long-term view."\par \par \uc2 Democrats said privately that they need to hear directly from the White House just what Trump is proposing. Illegal crossings into the United States at the Mexican border have plummeted under Trump, making the need for a wall even less urgent in the minds of many lawmakers.\par \par \uc2 "If they're really thinking that to give dreamers relief . . . that we're going to give them significant monies towards a border wall," \uc2 Sen. Robert Menendez\uc2  (D-N.J.) told reporters last month, "I can't see that."\par \par \uc2 Rep. Adriano Espaillat\uc2  (D-N.Y.), whose Harlem-area district is home to approximately 2,700 constituents protected by DACA, called a wall a "nonstarter" in the dreamer negotiations.\par \par \uc2 Caving on a wall or on curbs to legal immigration in order to protect the dreamers is a wildly lopsided trade-off in favor of immigration hawks, Democrats said. Polls show that upward of 80 percent of the public favors a solution to allow dreamers to remain in the country, and some Republican lawmakers have said they support a deal - highlighting the complex politics for the GOP in a midterm-election year.\par \par \uc2 "This is a crisis they've created," said Lorella Praeli, a former dreamer who became a U.S. citizen in 2015 and served as campaign adviser to \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 . She works as the ACLU's director of immigration and campaigns.\par \par \uc2 Praeli said the Democratic strategy of supporting the border fence in 2013 in hopes that it would give the comprehensive immigration bill a better chance at becoming law was a mistake. The bill also would have spent $40 billion on border security, including nearly doubling the number of Border Patrol agents to 40,000 and adding high-tech surveillance equipment.\par \par \uc2 Although the Senate approved the bill by a vote of 68 to 32, it died in the Republican-controlled House where immigration hard-liners - opposed to granting "amnesty" to undocumented immigrants - forced then-Speaker \uc2 John A. Boehner\uc2  (Ohio) into shelving the legislation.\par \par \uc2 "They did the best they could under the context and politics at the time, but immigration politics have changed," Praeli said. "There is a robust movement and accountability on Republicans and Democrats. Given the support on this issue and our constituency, we do not want to end up being in a situation where we say, 'Sure, take what you need to give us a solution' " on the dreamers.\par \par \uc2 david.nakamura@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 ed.okeefe@washpost.com \par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com\par \par \uc2 WP20180107trumpwall\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020180107ee170003a\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

But for \uc2 Kate Steinle\uc2 's parents, the legal battle over who is responsible for their daughter's death is just entering its next phase.\par \par \uc2 Jose Ines Garcia Zarate\uc2  was sentenced Friday to time served for unlawful possession of a firearm, following a jury's decision in November to reject murder charges against the Mexican national for firing a bullet that killed Steinle as she strolled down a San Francisco pier in 2015.\par \par \uc2 The acquittal provoked a fresh flurry of protest including from President Trump, who had used Steinle on the campaign trail to make the case for a border wall, an end to "sanctuary cities" and stricter immigration policy.\par \par \uc2 But Steinle family attorney Frank Pitre said after the trial that there had always been "two chairs missing on the defense table."\par \par \uc2 Steinle's parents want to see the city and county of San Francisco and its former sheriff pay for the fatal shooting, saying that their policies allowed Garcia Zarate, who already had been deported five times, to keep walking the streets of San Francisco.\par \par \uc2 They also want to see the federal government held responsible for the handgun that was used, after it was stolen from an federal agent's car.\par \par \uc2 "KATE's fate was sealed when a \uc2 U.S. Department of the Interior\uc2 , Bureau of Land Management Ranger failed to properly secure and/or store a government-issued firearm while it was left in an unoccupied vehicle in a high auto-theft neighborhood," the family said in a lawsuit filed in 2016 that also named immigration officials as defendants.\par \par \uc2 A federal judge dismissed the family's case against \uc2 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2 , San Francisco and the county's then-Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi, but said the case against the \uc2 Bureau of Land Management (BLM) \uc2 could proceed because its employee's negligence contributed to Steinle's death.\par \par \uc2 With the end of Garcia Zarate's latest trial, Pitre said attorneys can now access the files they need to take their wrongful death lawsuit to trial. They hope to secure a trial date at a scheduled hearing this month. They are also appealing the judge's ruling in the case against San Francisco and Mirkarimi.\par \par \uc2 The wrongful death cases could enlarge the political debate about what failed Steinle: local immigration policies or federal mismanagement of guns?\par \par \uc2 Trump - who had launched his presidential campaign two weeks before Steinle's killing with a speech decrying Mexican immigrants as criminals and calling for a border wall - quickly fixated on the death of "beautiful Kate." He said the case is proof that "sanctuary city" policies, which restrict local officials from assisting in enforcement of immigration laws, are dangerous and must be stopped.\par \par \uc2 Critics say his declarations of Garcia Zarate's guilt and what it meantskewed the public's understanding of the facts.\par \par \uc2 The 12-member jury in San Francisco Superior Court was tasked with deciding whether Garcia Zarate meant to shoot Steinle. His prior criminal record - including multiple convictions for drug charges and for reentering the country illegally - were never part of the discussion.\par \par \uc2 "We put aside politics, immigration status, sanctuary cities - all of it we put aside for our decision," said one juror, who asked to remain anonymous out of fear of being harmed by those angry with the verdict.\par \par \uc2 When the San Francisco Sheriff's Department released Garcia Zarate on a dropped marijuana charge in April 2015, he had no money, no cellphone and no place to live. Three months later, he was wandering around the pier - wearing two pairs of pants, with cracker crumbs in his pocket and one of his shoes missing its lace - when he found and picked up the stolen handgun.\par \par \uc2 It went off. The defense said a single bullet hit the ground 12 feet away and ricocheted 78 feet, the length of a tennis court, into Steinle's back.\par \par \uc2 The jury quickly discarded the first- and second-degree murder charges, which require premeditation, the juror said. It decided there was no evidence of involuntary manslaughter either, because the prosecution was unable to prove Garcia Zarate behaved recklessly.\par \par \uc2 "I think most people who were not in that courtroom do not understand the situation," said Phil Van Stockum, a mechanical engineer in San Francisco and an alternate juror in the trial. "The defendants' guilt in this case was just not related to the law on immigration."\par \par \uc2 Trump and conservative politicians and pundits condemned the jury's acquittals as an example of liberal politics prioritizing immigrants over public safety.\par \par \uc2 A Justice Department official said the \uc2 U.S. Marshals\uc2  took Garcia Zarate into federal custody Friday to face additional criminal charges in Northern California of being an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  and a felon in possession of a weapon. He will then face a supervised release violation in Texas, from a prior federal conviction for illegally reentering the country. After that, he will be subject to deportation, the official said.\par \par \uc2 As in the criminal case, the gun that Garcia Zarate found in a rag on the pier has been central so far in the wrongful death lawsuit the Steinle family filed in 2016.\par \par \uc2 John Woychowski, a ranger for the BLM, left the loaded firearm in a backpack in his car in June 2015 while he ate lunch at a restaurant with his girlfriend and her children.\par \par \uc2 Judge Joseph Spero determined that was a critical failure in the lead up to Steinle's death and dismissed the claims against all the defendants except the BLM.\par \par \uc2 San Francisco wasn't at fault, he said, because it didn't have to share Garcia Zarate's release date with \uc2 Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2 , and ICE didn't have to pick him up. But the weapon was supposed to be secured at all times, he said.\par \par \uc2 "A handgun is indisputably capable of inflicting serious injury and damage - as a deadly weapon, that is its very purpose," Spero wrote in a decision last January. The ranger, the judge said, "had a duty to better secure his handgun against theft."\par \par \uc2 Sarah Webster, a BLM spokeswoman, declined to comment on Woychowski or say whether the agency updated its firearms security policies after Steinle's death.\par \par \uc2 More than 500 federal firearms have been lost since fiscal year 2006, some of which have turned up in homicides and other crimes, according to federal records. In September 2016, California passed a bill requiring law enforcement officials to lock their firearms stored in vehicleseither in trunks or in lockboxes out of view or face a fine of up to $1,000.\par \par \uc2 It is unclear who stole Woychowski's gun and how it got to the pier. Garcia Zarate was never accused of stealing it.\par \par \uc2 "If you don't have a fully loaded gun sitting out there on the pier . . . you don't have this incident," said Francisco Ugarte, a lawyer who represented Garcia Zarate in the criminal case with leadpublic defender Matt Gonzalez. "Any person could have picked up that rag on the pier. It could have been the Department of Public Works cleaning up the pier. It could have been a child. Or it could have been another homeless person."\par \par \uc2 But ICE has consistently placed the blame for Steinle's death on San Francisco's sanctuary city policy.\par \par \uc2 ICE files detainers requesting that jurisdictions hold undocumented immigrants for up to 48 hours so agents can pick them up. But in areas that refuse, the agency asks at least to be notified of their release. San Francisco's sheriff at the time ignored the request.\par \par \uc2 After the Garcia Zarate's acquittal, then-San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee reasserted that the city "is and always will be a sanctuary city." But Lee, who died last month, also has criticized Mirkarimi's handling of the matter.\par \par \uc2 "San Francisco's Sanctuary City ordinance allows for communication with federal law enforcement regarding convicted felons," Lee said in a statement the day after Steinle's death.\par \par \uc2 But Spero found the sheriff was not out of bounds, since "no law required the Sheriff's Department to share [Garcia Zarate]'s release date with ICE."\par \par \uc2 In an interview with The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2  last month, Mirkarimi reiterated that statement and noted that ICE was well-versed in his policy.\par \par \uc2 The Steinles' appeal of Spero's decision is being heard by the U.S. Appeals Court for the 9th Circuit. Pitre, the family's lawyer, said the sheriff's department does bear part of the blame as Mirkarimi was acting outside of what the sanctuary city policy stipulates.\par \par \uc2 "That's why I have a real problem when we talk about responsibility for Kate's death [and the conversation] looks solely at a hapless individual who was playing with a weapon that went off," he said, "without looking at who was responsible for that gun being in his hands, and who is responsible for going beyond his authority in deciding not to share information on who was in his custody."\par \par \uc2 abigail.hauslohner@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 maria.sacchetti@washpost.com \par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com\par \par \uc2 WP20180107steinle\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020180107ee170002m\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The Democrat-controlled Senate was nearing a make-or-break vote on a comprehensive immigration bill in June 2013 when a pair of Republican senators swooped in with an 11th-hour amendment aimed at clinching enough GOP support to avoid a filibuster.\par \par \uc2 A key provision: doubling the length of a new border "fence" between the United States and Mexico from 350\u160\'00\'A0miles to 700 miles.\par \par \uc2 Democrats didn't think such a barrier was necessary. Neither did the Obama White House. To them, the proposal seemed arbitrary \u8212\'20\'14 a random doubling of the size at the last minute for political purposes. In the end, though, all 54 Democrats in the Senate supported the provision in hopes of realizing a bigger goal \u8212\'20\'14 providing a path to citizenship for millions of undocumented immigrants.\par \par \uc2 This month, President Trump is ratcheting up demands that Congress include his border wall in a package to provide legal status for hundreds of thousands of immigrants brought to the country illegally as children. The administration is preparing to ask for $18\u160\'00\'A0billion over a decade to renovate and build 700\u160\'00\'A0miles of wall along the southwest border, according to a memo from the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "We want a wall," Trump declared on Saturday after meeting with Republican leaders at Camp David in Maryland. "A wall must happen or we will not have" a deal.\par \par \uc2 Lawmakers face a March\u160\'00\'A05 deadline, set by Trump, after which work permits for the undocumented "dreamers" provided by former president \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program will begin to expire at a rate of nearly 1,000 per day.\par \par \uc2 But the debate illustrates how the political stakes have shifted since Trump took office.\par \par \uc2 Democrats, under pressure from immigrant rights groups, have strenuously opposed including Trump's wall in the negotiations. They call it a waste of taxpayer money, but they also have signaled that the political price for helping the president make good on his prime campaign promise is far too high.\par \par \uc2 Trump, through his anti-\uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2  rhetoric and policies, including a travel ban aimed at Muslim-majority countries, has made the wall a metaphor to many Democrats of an administration whose crackdown on immigration they say has overtones of xenophobia or racism.\par \par \uc2 "The debate over a wall goes back decades. The notion of a wall is a giant symbol that is not based on analysis in any way of whether we should do something about the border," said \uc2 Cecilia Mu\u241\'00\'F1oz\uc2 , a longtime immigrant rights advocate who served as Obama's domestic policy adviser. "The fact is, having elevated the notion of a wall in his campaign the way he did, the president made it an even bigger symbol than it already was \u8212\'20\'14 and that makes it much harder to accomplish."\par \par \uc2 In a letter to colleagues Friday, House Minority Leader \uc2 Nancy Pelosi\uc2  (D-Calif.) called the Trump administration's request for wall funding "alarming" and said her caucus "must all speak out."\par \par \uc2 On the other side of the debate, wall proponents are perplexed why Democrats are voicing such vociferous opposition.\par \par \uc2 In 2006, President \uc2 George W. Bush\uc2  signed into law the Secure Fence Act, a bill that authorized the construction of hundreds of miles of fencing along the border. That legislation was approved with broad bipartisan support, including, in the Senate, by such Democratic luminaries as \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  (Ill.), \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  (N.Y.), \uc2 Joe Biden\uc2  (Del.) and \uc2 Charles E. Schumer\uc2  (N.Y.), now the Senate minority leader.\par \par \uc2 "Where I don't understand the pushback is, in 2013 if everybody was for the 700 miles of double fencing, but now they're not for it because Trump calls it a wall \u8212\'20\'14 to me that does not make sense," said Brandon Judd, president of the National Border Patrol Council, the labor union for the Border Patrol agents. "Whether we call it a fence or call it a wall, it acts as the exact same thing \u8212\'20\'14 a physical barrier that makes it more difficult to enter the United States illegally. I don't understand the whole fight over this."\par \par \uc2 In a statement, Schumer said, "We'd be glad to do comprehensive immigration reform, like the Senate bill from 2013, that has more of what both sides want, but that will take time. There is an immediate need to protect the DACA recipients, so the deal will be more narrow than that."\par \par \uc2 It's not just the wall that has scrambled the debate. Trump also is demanding changes to the nation's legal immigration system, including curbing what the president calls "chain migration" \u8212\'20\'14 the practice of immigrants petitioning for extended family members to enter the country \u8212\'20\'14 and terminating a diversity visa lottery that provides 55,000 green cards to people from countries with low immigration rates to the United States.\par \par \uc2 The 2013 immigration bill approved by the Senate \u8212\'20\'14 with 14 Republicans joining the 54 Democrats \u8212\'20\'14 included provisions to end that lottery and to eliminate the ability of brothers and sisters of U.S. citizens to enter the country on family reunification visas. That bill also created a new category of "merit-based" visas in which prospective immigrants were awarded points for education levels and work expertise \u8212\'20\'14 another concept Trump has championed.\par \par \uc2 Democrats insist it is not fair to compare the 2013 debate to the current one. Five years ago, the negotiations were aimed at a far more sweeping comprehensive bill to fix an immigration system both parties agreed was broken. That legislation included changes to worker visas, cleared lengthy backlogs in legal immigration waiting lists, and offered a path to citizenship for all of the nation's estimated 11\u160\'00\'A0million undocumented immigrants.\par \par \uc2 This year, the debate centers on the fate of a far smaller group. Nearly 700,000 dreamers were enrolled in the DACA program, started by Obama in 2012, when Trump terminated it in September. Not all dreamers had applied for the program, however, and all told, depending on how the group is defined, there could be a total of more than 1.5 million dreamers in the country, according to experts.\par \par \uc2 Democrats have eyed a Jan. 19 deadline for lawmakers to approve a must-pass spending bill as leverage to forge a narrow deal for some portion or all of this group.\par \par \uc2 Trump signaled last fall that, although he was adamant that lawmakers beef up border security, funding for a wall did not have to be tied to the dreamer issue. In recent months, however, the president has emphasized that any DACA legislation "must secure the border with a wall," as he reiterated Thursday.\par \par \uc2 Lawmakers remain uncertain about exactly what Trump is asking for. During the campaign, he called for a contiguous wall along 2,000 miles of the border, something even the Border Patrol union does not think is necessary.\par \par \uc2 After meeting with Trump at the White House on Thursday, Republican senators said such talk is misguided\par \par \uc2 Sen. Thom Tillis\uc2  (R-N.C.) said that despite the president's past campaign rhetoric, "he's listened to border security" experts and now believes "there's a need for walls and barriers in a number of places and the use of technology and personnel in others."\par \par \uc2 Ultimately, Tillis said, Republicans are hoping for "a net increase of 600 miles of wall. That will be varying barriers based on where you are along the border, but that's the long-term view."\par \par \uc2 Democrats said privately that they need to hear directly from the White House just what Trump is proposing. Illegal crossings into the United States at the Mexican border have plummeted under Trump, making the need for a wall even less urgent in the mind of many lawmakers.\par \par \uc2 "If they're really thinking that to give dreamers relief .\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09. that we're going to give them significant monies towards a border wall," \uc2 Sen. Robert Menendez\uc2  (D-N.J.) told reporters last month, "I can't see that."\par \par \uc2 Rep. Adriano Espaillat\uc2  (D-N.Y.), whose Harlem-area district is home to approximately 2,700 constituents protected by DACA, called a wall a "nonstarter" in the dreamer negotiations.\par \par \uc2 Caving on a wall or on curbs to legal immigration in order to protect the dreamers is a wildly lopsided trade-off in favor of immigration hawks, Democrats said. Polls show that upward of 80\u160\'00\'A0percent of the public favors a solution to allow dreamers to remain in the country, and some Republican lawmakers have said they support a deal \u8212\'20\'14 highlighting the complex politics for the GOP in a midterm-election year.\par \par \uc2 "This is a crisis they've created," said Lorella Praeli, a former dreamer who became a U.S. citizen in 2015 and served as campaign adviser to \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 . She now works as the ACLU's director of immigration and campaigns.\par \par \uc2 Praeli said the Democratic strategy of supporting the border fence in 2013 in hopes that it would give the comprehensive immigration bill a better chance at becoming law was a mistake. The bill also would have spent $40 billion on border security, including nearly doubling the number of Border Patrol agents to 40,000 and adding high-tech surveillance equipment.\par \par \uc2 Although the Senate approved the bill by a vote of 68 to 32, it died in the Republican-controlled House where immigration hard-liners \u8212\'20\'14 opposed to granting "amnesty" to undocumented immigrants \u8212\'20\'14 forced then-Speaker \uc2 John A. Boehner\uc2  (Ohio) into shelving the legislation.\par \par \uc2 "They did the best they could under the context and politics at the time, but immigration politics have changed," Praeli said. "There is a robust movement and accountability on Republicans and Democrats. Given the support on this issue and our constituency, we do not want to end up being in a situation where we say, 'Sure, take what you need to give us a solution'\u8201\'20\'09" on the dreamers.\par \par \uc2 david.nakamura@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 ed.okeefe@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020180106ee16002pb\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved \par \par \uc2 One criminal case is over, and an undocumented immigrant is slated for future deportation. But for \uc2 Kate Steinle\uc2 's parents, the legal battle over who is responsible for their daughter's death is just entering its next phase.\par \par \uc2 Jose Ines Garcia Zarate\uc2  was sentenced Friday to time served for unlawful possession of a firearm, following a jury's decision in November to reject murder charges against the Mexican national for firing a bullet that killed Steinle as she strolled down a San Francisco pier in 2015.\par \par \uc2 The acquittal provoked a fresh flurry of protest.. including from President Trump, who had used Steinle on the campaign trail to make the case for a border wall, an end to "sanctuary cities" and stricter immigration policy.\par \par \uc2 But Steinle family attorney Frank Pitre said after the trial that there had always been "two chairs missing on the defense table."\par \par \uc2 Steinle's parents want to see the city and county of San Francisco and its former sheriff pay for the fatal shooting, saying that their policies allowed Garcia Zarate, who already had been deported five times, to keep walking the streets of San Francisco.\par \par \uc2 They also want to see the federal government held responsible for the handgun that was used, after it was stolen from an federal agent's car.\par \par \uc2 "KATE's fate was sealed when a \uc2 U.S. Department of the Interior\uc2 , Bureau of Land Management Ranger failed to properly secure and/or store a government-issued firearm while it was left in an unoccupied vehicle in a high auto-theft neighborhood," the family said in a lawsuit filed in 2016 that also named immigration officials as defendants.\par \par \uc2 A federal judge dismissed the family's case against \uc2 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2 , San Francisco and the county's then-Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi, but said the case against the \uc2 Bureau of Land Management (BLM) \uc2 could proceed because its employee's negligence contributed to Steinle's death.\par \par \uc2 With the end of Garcia Zarate's latest trial, Pitre said attorneys can now access the files they need to take their wrongful death lawsuit to trial. They hope to secure a trial date at a scheduled hearing this month. They are also appealing the judge's ruling in the case against San Francisco and Mirkarimi.\par \par \uc2 The wrongful death cases could enlarge the political debate about what failed Steinle: local immigration policies or federal mismanagement of guns?\par \par \uc2 Trump - who had launched his presidential campaign two weeks before Steinle's killing with a speech decrying Mexican immigrants as criminals and calling for a border wall - quickly fixated on the death of "beautiful Kate." He said the case is proof that "sanctuary city" policies, which restrict local officials from assisting in enforcement of immigration laws, are dangerous and must be stopped.\par \par \uc2 Critics say his declarations of Garcia Zarate's guilt and what it meant skewed the public's understanding of the facts.\par \par \uc2 The 12-member jury in San Francisco Superior Court was tasked with deciding whether Garcia Zarate meant to shoot Steinle. His prior criminal record - including multiple convictions for drug charges and for reentering the country illegally - were never part of the discussion.\par \par \uc2 "We put aside politics, immigration status, sanctuary cities - all of it we put aside for our decision," said one juror, who asked to remain anonymous out of fear of being harmed by those angry with the verdict.\par \par \uc2 When the San Francisco Sheriff's Department released Garcia Zarate on a dropped marijuana charge in April 2015, he had no money, no cellphone and no place to live. Three months later, he was wandering around the pier - wearing two pairs of pants, with cracker crumbs in his pocket and one of his shoes missing its lace - when he found and picked up the stolen handgun.\par \par \uc2 It went off. The defense said a single bullet hit the ground 12 feet away and ricocheted 78 feet, the length of a tennis court, into Steinle's back.\par \par \uc2 The jury quickly discarded the first- and second-degree murder charges, which require premeditation, the juror said. It decided there was no evidence of involuntary manslaughter either, because the prosecution was unable to prove Garcia Zarate behaved recklessly.\par \par \uc2 "I think most people who were not in that courtroom do not understand the situation," said Phil Van Stockum, a mechanical engineer in San Francisco and an alternate juror in the trial. "The defendant's guilt in this case was just not related to the law on immigration."\par \par \uc2 Trump and conservative politicians and pundits condemned the jury's acquittals as an example of liberal politics prioritizing immigrants over public safety.\par \par \uc2 A Justice Department official said the \uc2 U.S. Marshals\uc2  took Garcia Zarate into federal custody Friday to face additional criminal charges in Northern California of being an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  and a felon in possession of a weapon. He will then face a supervised release violation in Texas, from a prior federal conviction for illegally reentering the country. After that, he will be subject to deportation, the official said.\par \par \uc2 As in the criminal case, the gun that Garcia Zarate found in a rag on the pier has been central so far in the wrongful death lawsuit the Steinle family filed in 2016.\par \par \uc2 John Woychowski, a ranger for the BLM, left the loaded firearm in a backpack in his car in June 2015 while he ate lunch at a restaurant with his girlfriend and her children.\par \par \uc2 Judge Joseph Spero determined that was a critical failure in the lead up to Steinle's death and dismissed the claims against all the defendants except the BLM.\par \par \uc2 San Francisco wasn't at fault, he said, because it didn't have to share Garcia Zarate's release date with \uc2 Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2 , and ICE didn't have to pick him up. But the weapon was supposed to be secured at all times, he said.\par \par \uc2 "A handgun is indisputably capable of inflicting serious injury and damage - as a deadly weapon, that is its very purpose," Spero wrote in a decision last January. The ranger, the judge said, "had a duty to better secure his handgun against theft."\par \par \uc2 Sarah Webster, a BLM spokeswoman, declined to comment on Woychowski or say whether the agency updated its firearms security policies after Steinle's death.\par \par \uc2 More than 500 federal firearms have been lost since fiscal year 2006, some of which have turned up in homicides and other crimes, according to federal records. In September 2016, California passed a bill requiring law enforcement officials to lock their firearms stored in vehicles either in trunks or in lockboxes out of view or face a fine of up to $1,000.\par \par \uc2 It is unclear who stole Woychowski's gun and how it got to the pier. Garcia Zarate was never accused of stealing it.\par \par \uc2 "If you don't have a fully loaded gun sitting out there on the pier . . . you don't have this incident," said Francisco Ugarte, a lawyer who represented Garcia Zarate in the criminal case with lead public defender Matt Gonzalez. "Any person could have picked up that rag on the pier. It could have been the Department of Public Works cleaning up the pier. It could have been a child. Or it could have been another homeless person."\par \par \uc2 But ICE has consistently placed the blame for Steinle's death on San Francisco's sanctuary city policy.\par \par \uc2 ICE files detainers requesting that jurisdictions hold undocumented immigrants for up to 48 hours so agents can pick them up. But in areas that refuse, the agency asks at least to be notified of their release. San Francisco's sheriff at the time ignored the request.\par \par \uc2 After Garcia Zarate's acquittal, then-San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee reasserted that the city "is and always will be a sanctuary city." But Lee, who died last month, also has criticized Mirkarimi's handling of the matter.\par \par \uc2 "San Francisco's Sanctuary City ordinance allows for communication with federal law enforcement regarding convicted felons," Lee said in a statement the day after Steinle's death.\par \par \uc2 But Spero found the sheriff was not out of bounds, since "no law required the Sheriff's Department to share [Garcia Zarate's] release date with ICE."\par \par \uc2 In an interview with The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2  last month, Mirkarimi reiterated that statement and noted that ICE was well-versed in his policy.\par \par \uc2 The Steinles' appeal of Spero's decision is being heard by the U.S. Appeals Court for the 9th Circuit. Pitre, the family's lawyer, said the sheriff's department does bear part of the blame, as Mirkarimi was acting outside of what the sanctuary city policy stipulates.\par \par \uc2 "That's why I have a real problem when we talk about responsibility for Kate's death [and the conversation] looks solely at a hapless individual who was playing with a weapon that went off," he said, "without looking at who was responsible for that gun being in his hands, and who is responsible for going beyond his authority in deciding not to share information on who was in his custody."\par \par \uc2 abigail.hauslohner@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 maria.sacchetti@washpost.com \par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com\par \par \uc2 WP20180106steinle\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020180106ee160002a\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 One criminal case is over, and an undocumented immigrant is slated for future deportation. But for \uc2 Kate Steinle\uc2 's parents, the legal battle over who is responsible for their daughter's death is just entering its next phase.\par \par \uc2 Jose Ines Garcia Zarate\uc2  was sentenced Friday to time served for unlawful possession of a firearm, following a jury's decision in November to reject murder charges against the Mexican national for firing a bullet that killed Steinle as she strolled down a San Francisco pier in 2015.\par \par \uc2 The acquittal provoked a fresh flurry of protest.. including from President Trump, who had used Steinle on the campaign trail to make the case for a border wall, an end to "sanctuary cities" and stricter immigration policy.\par \par \uc2 But Steinle family attorney Frank Pitre said after the trial that there had always been "two chairs missing on the defense table."\par \par \uc2 Steinle's parents want to see the city and county of San Francisco and its former sheriff pay for the fatal shooting, saying that their policies allowed Garcia Zarate, who already had been deported five times, to keep walking the streets of San Francisco.\par \par \uc2 They also want to see the federal government held responsible for the handgun that was used, after it was stolen from an federal agent's car.\par \par \uc2 "KATE's fate was sealed when a \uc2 U.S. Department of the Interior\uc2 , Bureau of Land Management Ranger failed to properly secure and/or store a government-issued firearm while it was left in an unoccupied vehicle in a high auto-theft neighborhood," the family said in a lawsuit filed in 2016 that also named immigration officials as defendants.\par \par \uc2 A federal judge dismissed the family's case against \uc2 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2 , San Francisco and the county's then-Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi, but said the case against the \uc2 Bureau of Land Management (BLM) \uc2 could proceed because its employee's negligence contributed to Steinle's death.\par \par \uc2 With the end of Garcia Zarate's latest trial, Pitre said attorneys can now access the files they need to take their wrongful death lawsuit to trial. They hope to secure a trial date at a scheduled hearing this month. They are also appealing the judge's ruling in the case against San Francisco and Mirkarimi.\par \par \uc2 The wrongful death cases could enlarge the political debate about what failed Steinle: local immigration policies or federal mismanagement of guns?\par \par \uc2 Trump \u8212\'20\'14 who had launched his presidential campaign two weeks before Steinle's killing with a speech decrying Mexican immigrants as criminals and calling for a border wall \u8212\'20\'14 quickly fixated on the death of "beautiful Kate." He said the case is proof that "sanctuary city" policies, which restrict local officials from assisting in enforcement of immigration laws, are dangerous and must be stopped.\par \par \uc2 Critics say his declarations of Garcia Zarate's guilt and what it meantskewed the public's understanding of the facts.\par \par \uc2 The 12-member jury in San Francisco Superior Court was tasked with deciding whether Garcia Zarate meant to shoot Steinle. His prior criminal record \u8212\'20\'14 including multiple convictions for drug charges and for reentering the country illegally \u8212\'20\'14 were never part of the discussion.\par \par \uc2 "We put aside politics, immigration status, sanctuary cities \u8212\'20\'14 all of it we put aside for our decision," said one juror, who asked to remain anonymous out of fear of being harmed by those angry with the verdict.\par \par \uc2 When the San Francisco Sheriff's Department released Garcia Zarate on a dropped marijuana charge in April 2015, he had no money, no cellphone and no place to live. Three months later, he was wandering around the pier \u8212\'20\'14 wearing two pairs of pants, with cracker crumbs in his pocket and one of his shoes missing its lace \u8212\'20\'14 when he found and picked up the stolen handgun.\par \par \uc2 It went off. The defense said a single bullet hit the ground 12 feet away and ricocheted 78 feet, the length of a tennis court, into Steinle's back.\par \par \uc2 The jury quickly discarded the first- and second-degree murder charges, which require premeditation, the juror said. It decided there was no evidence of involuntary manslaughter either, because the prosecution was unable to prove Garcia Zarate behaved recklessly.\par \par \uc2 "I think most people who were not in that courtroom do not understand the situation," said Phil Van Stockum, a mechanical engineer in San Francisco and an alternate juror in the trial. "The defendant's guilt in this case was just not related to the law on immigration."\par \par \uc2 Trump and conservative politicians and pundits condemned the jury's acquittals as an example of liberal politics prioritizing immigrants over public safety.\par \par \uc2 A Justice Department official said the \uc2 U.S. Marshals\uc2  took Garcia Zarate into federal custody Friday to face additional criminal charges in Northern California of being an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  and a felon in possession of a weapon. He will then face a supervised release violation in Texas, from a prior federal conviction for illegally reentering the country. After that, he will be subject to deportation, the official said.\par \par \uc2 As in the criminal case, the gun that Garcia Zarate found in a rag on the pier has been central so far in the wrongful death lawsuit the Steinle family filed in 2016.\par \par \uc2 John Woychowski, a ranger for the BLM, left the loaded firearm in a backpack in his car in June 2015 while he ate lunch at a restaurant with his girlfriend and her children.\par \par \uc2 Judge Joseph Spero determined that was a critical failure in the lead up to Steinle's death and dismissed the claims against all the defendants except the BLM.\par \par \uc2 San Francisco wasn't at fault, he said, because it didn't have to share Garcia Zarate's release date with \uc2 Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2 , and ICE didn't have to pick him up. But the weapon was supposed to be secured at all times, he said.\par \par \uc2 "A handgun is indisputably capable of inflicting serious injury and damage \u8212\'20\'14 as a deadly weapon, that is its very purpose," Spero wrote in a decision last January. The ranger, the judge said, "had a duty to better secure his handgun against theft."\par \par \uc2 Sarah Webster, a BLM spokeswoman, declined to comment on Woychowski or say whether the agency updated its firearms security policies after Steinle's death.\par \par \uc2 More than 500 federal firearms have been lost since fiscal year 2006, some of which have turned up in homicides and other crimes, according to federal records. In September 2016, California passed a bill requiring law enforcement officials to lock their firearms stored in vehicleseither in trunks or in lockboxes out of view or face a fine of up to $1,000.\par \par \uc2 It is unclear who stole Woychowski's gun and how it got to the pier. Garcia Zarate was never accused of stealing it.\par \par \uc2 "If you don't have a fully loaded gun sitting out there on the pier .\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09. you don't have this incident," said Francisco Ugarte, a lawyer who represented Garcia Zarate in the criminal case with leadpublic defender Matt Gonzalez. "Any person could have picked up that rag on the pier. It could have been the Department of Public Works cleaning up the pier. It could have been a child. Or it could have been another homeless person."\par \par \uc2 But ICE has consistently placed the blame for Steinle's death on San Francisco's sanctuary city policy.\par \par \uc2 ICE files detainers requesting that jurisdictions hold undocumented immigrants for up to 48 hours so agents can pick them up. But in areas that refuse, the agency asks at least to be notified of their release. San Francisco's sheriff at the time ignored the request.\par \par \uc2 After Garcia Zarate's acquittal, then-San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee reasserted that the city "is and always will be a sanctuary city." But Lee, who died last month , also has criticized Mirkarimi's handling of the matter.\par \par \uc2 "San Francisco's Sanctuary City ordinance allows for communication with federal law enforcement regarding convicted felons," Lee said in a statement the day after Steinle's death.\par \par \uc2 But Spero, the judge who dismissed the Steinle's lawsuit against San Francisco and Mirkarimi, found the sheriff was not out of bounds, since "no law required the Sheriff's Department to share [Garcia Zarate's] release date with ICE."\par \par \uc2 In an interview with The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2  last month, Mirkarimi reiterated that statement and noted that ICE was well-versed in his policy.\par \par \uc2 The Steinles' appeal of Spero's decision is being heard by the U.S. Appeals Court for the 9th Circuit. Pitre, the family's lawyer, said the sheriff's department does bear part of the blame, as Mirkarimi was acting outside of what the sanctuary city policy stipulates.\par \par \uc2 "That's why I have a real problem when we talk about responsibility for Kate's death [and the conversation] looks solely at a hapless individual who was playing with a weapon that went off," he said, "without looking at who was responsible for that gun being in his hands, and who is responsible for going beyond his authority in deciding not to share information on who was in his custody."\par \par \uc2 abigail.hauslohner@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 maria.sacchetti@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020180105ee15006em\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 There is no issue that has so dominated President Trump's presidency and disfigured the GOP than obsessive, unhinged fear-mongering about illegal immigrants \u8212\'20\'14 which has now morphed into a broader mission against legal immigration. What was once a distressing fetish among a narrow group on the right has become \u8212\'20\'14 along with protectionism \u8212\'20\'14 a rallying call for a party disinclined to pay attention to facts (and Labor Economics 101) and determined to humor the aggrieved white non-college educated working class that has been fed a steady anti-immigrant diet by Fox News and other right-wing media.\par \par \uc2 Anti-immigrant voices' smokescreen that they were only opposed to illegal immigration has been shredded. They now revel in their calls for immigration exclusionism. If allowed to persist, it will distort and damage our economy and impede entrepreneurship. It has already encouraged a wholly-misguided approach to crime fighting.\par \par \uc2 Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Trump have concocted a theory that we are awash in crime because of illegal immigrants, especially those living in "sanctuary cities." That is patently false, and Sessions' efforts to punish cities that refuse to do the feds bidding in detaining and helping to deport \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  have been swatted down in court. However, the barrage of litigation over sanctuary cities and obsession with the issue has led us to ignore both the successes and failures in crime fighting \u8212\'20\'14 and the causes of each.\par \par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal reports this week (in step with reams of other reports and studies over the last few years) that crime is affected by local conditions, not immigration policy. The report examined "the locations of thousands of homicides in four cities: Chicago and Baltimore, where violence has risen to or near 1990s levels in the past two years; and Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., where meaningful declines in violence have been sustained since the 1990s." (All four have been criticized by anti-immigrant groups for failing to cooperate sufficiently with feds \u8212\'20\'14 when, for example, there is no warrant to detain suspected illegal immigrants.)\par \par \uc2 According to the data, "the neighborhoods where killings have soared in Chicago and Baltimore share worsening poverty, high numbers of vacant houses, and a lighter street presence by police following officers' high-profile killings of young black men." By contrast, "In Washington and Los Angeles, gang interventions and community policing, which seeks closer contact with residents to gain trust and even information in to address crime, have helped produce long-term reductions in murders. Gentrification in the nation's capital also has played an important role in keeping violence down." The deference between success and failure often boils down to how police interact with a handful of neighborhoods. ("\uc2 George Mason University\uc2  criminologist David Weisburd said his research has shown that about 1% of city streets produce 25% of a city's crime, and 5% of the streets produce half the crime. He calls it the 'law of crime concentration.'")\par \par \uc2 So when the Justice Department threatens to yank funding from local law enforcement or demands that authorities undercut the relationships they've built up over years to earn the trust of those affected by crime, he is quite simply making cities more dangerous.\par \par \uc2 In Baltimore, illegal immigrants have nothing to do with the crime epidemic. ("Since the unrest [after the Freddie Gray killing], arrest numbers in the city are down. The police force is also at reduced strength because of retirements and resignations that have left it with 2,500 sworn officers, or about 500 fewer than in 2012. And eight officers were indicted this year on federal charges that included robbing citizens; five have pleaded guilty. 'You look at Baltimore's crime numbers, that's criminals taking advantage of weakness,' Mr. Barksdale said. He added: "I am against mass arrests, but you still need arrests.") The residents are practically begging for a more involved, robust police presence. ("Jacqueline Caldwell, a local resident who leads a nonprofit umbrella group that includes several west-side community associations, said the police have become nonexistent over the past two years. 'I don't think it takes a rocket scientist to figure out we need more police on the street, more community involvement with the police,' Ms. Caldwell said.")\par \par \uc2 By contrast, in Los Angeles \u8212\'20\'14 where the number of illegal immigrants dwarf all other major metropolitan cities but one \u8212\'20\'14 crime has dropped precipitously. "According to the \uc2 FBI\uc2 's Uniform Crime Reporting Statistics, the LAPD reported the violent crime rate per 100,000 people declined from 820.6 in 2005 \u8212\'20\'14 the year [Mayor Antonio] Villaraigosa took office \u8212\'20\'14 to 426 in 2013, the year he left office. That represents a 48 percent reduction in the violent crime rate, homicide, rape, robbery and assaults." Part of the credit goes to hiring more police, but criminologists also attribute the decline to the "focus on community policing and crime prevention and intervention." The current police chief cites the positive impact from "diverting at-risk youth from gangs; recruiting gang members to prevent conflicts between rival gangs from flaring up; and handing out grocery store gift cards in exchange for guns."\par \par \uc2 So when Los Angeles mayors and police chiefs tell the Justice Department that making police into immigration agents will impair their community policing success and divert valuable resources, maybe we should listen to them. Conservatives used to understand that in federalism we have the "laboratories of democracy," namely the opportunities to find through experimentation what works and what doesn't. Rather than riding roughshod of localities, Sessions should highlight the successes of local police departments, urge others to follow suit and increase funding \u8212\'20\'14 rather than threaten to yank it for spurious reasons \u8212\'20\'14 for those localities that need it the most. Alas, his ideological fixation with demonizing illegal immigrants seems to preclude such a fact-based approach.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020171227edcr002s1\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 all-opinions-are-local\par {\*\bkmkstart toc93}{\*\bkmkend toc93}\b \uc2 Appeasement is a bad reason to support the Maryland Trust Act \b0\par\par\uc2 By Thomas Wheatley \par \uc2 716 \uc2 words\par \uc2 12 December 2017\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2017, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 In the words of James Bond villain Alec Trevelyan, why can't the Maryland Law Enforcement and Governmental Trust Act just be a good boy and die?\par \par \uc2 Last spring, legislation by the same name died in the Senate, much to the frustration of advocates of undocumented immigrants. Yet sure enough, some Maryland progressives and their allies, including the Maryland ACLU and CASA de Maryland, plan to resurrect the bill as soon as possible and have already held public forums to discuss just that.\par \par \uc2 For those new to the Trust Act (or at least its most recent version), the bill effectively makes Maryland a sanctuary state by limiting law enforcement's cooperation with federal immigration efforts and banning state officers from investigating citizens' immigration status. In the previous legislative session, the bill was roundly condemned as reckless by Democrats and Republicans alike. "Maryland is not going to become a sanctuary state," Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller Jr. (D-Calvert) said of the bill.\par \par \uc2 Yet supporters of the bill say the measure will help "foster trust between immigrant/minority individuals and state/local government." In redressing arguments suggesting the bill may make Maryland a magnet for criminals, supporters argue the opposite: that when trust exists between \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  communities and law enforcement, the former will be more likely to report crime. Thus, the Trust Act would in fact "make our families and communities safer" \u8212\'20\'14 or so the argument goes.\par \par \uc2 Admittedly, the theory makes sense (although it is unclear such newfound trust will offset a surge in violent crime, such as the one Northern Virginia and the Maryland suburbs of D.C. have seen with the expansion of MS-13). But before throwing their support behind the Trust Act's latest reincarnation, Maryland lawmakers should take a moment to appreciate the foundational absurdity of this reasoning.\par \par \uc2 First, the only reason there is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  community distrustful of law enforcement and harboring criminal secrets is because of a consistent tolerance of illegal immigration in the first place. Reckless "come one, come all" policies at the local level have yielded reticent nests of criminality that are now, incredibly, insisting that it is our police force and citizenry that need to change. Put differently, supporters of the Trust Act want their fellow citizens to believe that it's not dousing the house in gasoline that's dangerous, it's lighting the match.\par \par \uc2 Second, the trust argument steps all over the message pro-illegal immigration coalitions have been pushing for years: that permitting illegal immigration is a safe and commendable act of compassion. At the least, I am unsure how fueling human trafficking and inducing innocent immigrants to ensnare themselves in helpless and fearsome circumstances is an act of compassion.\par \par \uc2 It also calls into question the reliability of oft-cited statistics concerning the relationship between illegal immigration and crime. Marylanders are supposed to believe that immigrants commit less crime than U.S.-born citizens, yet also believe there is unreported crime occurring exclusively in \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  communities, right under the nose of law enforcement, which only sanctuary policy can correct.\par \par \uc2 Even assuming currently unreported crimes involve illegal immigrants as victims rather than perpetrators, the tension remains. In an interview with the New York Times, Silvia Pastor Finkelstein, director of the Office of Immigrant Affairs in the Nassau County (N.Y.) District Attorney's Office, estimated that 95 percent of perpetrators of violent crime against illegal immigrants were themselves foreign-born. (Why "estimated"? Because as a matter of policy, the office remains willfully blind; like the Maryland Trust Act provides, it is not allowed to investigate the immigration status of the defendant. See the problem yet?).\par \par \uc2 Finally, there is the repulsiveness that comes with accommodating lawlessness. Federal law, especially that which concerns immigration, is a reflection of the will of the people and therefore deserves our respect. States, including Maryland, should be confronting the dangers of illegal immigration by working to make illegal immigration as unappealing as possible. Immigrants, particularly those escaping violence and economic hardship in Central America, deserve our help, and we should explore all possible ways to grant such relief, but lawfully so. Anything contrary is not "compassionate" \u8212\'20\'14 it's appeasement.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020171211edcb006sh\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Forget for a moment whether President Trump truly believes the White House to be "a real dump," as he denied ever saying.\par \par \uc2 This much we know: Work orders for 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. reveal the building to be, if not dumplike, well \u8230\'20\'26 a little bit worn, like so many other old houses around the country.\par \par \uc2 There are the usual ceiling leaks.\par \par \uc2 The occasional overflowing toilet.\par \par \uc2 Chipped paint in need of a touch up or two.\par \par \uc2 And rodents and bugs, too.\par \par \uc2 According to the dozens of documents, which were obtained by NBC Washington, mice infiltrations were reported in the White House's Navy mess food service area and Situation Room.\par \par \uc2 There were at least four reports of cockroaches on the White House grounds, and ants in the chief of staff's office.\par \par \uc2 The work orders cover much of 2017, including the last few weeks of the Obama presidency. The requests were fielded by the federal Public Buildings Service, which owns, leases and manages some 8,700 government facilities around the country, including various federal agencies and courthouses, in addition to the White House.\par \par \uc2 The old building \u8212\'20\'14 the cornerstone was laid in 1792 \u8212\'20\'14 consists of 55,000 square feet of floor area spread out over 132 rooms.\par \par \uc2 It is not the easiest structure to keep up.\par \par \uc2 "It's an enormous job. \uc2 GSA\uc2  is assigned to manage that job," Brian Miller, former inspector general of the General Services Administration, which includes the Public Buildings Service, told the NBC affiliate. "\uc2 GSA\uc2  hires contractors and subcontractors for the [maintenance] work. Then the agency must watch over the contractors."\par \par \uc2 Using the \uc2 GSA\uc2 's own figures, NBC Washington estimated that the building costs the agency at least $100,000 to maintain each year.\par \par \uc2 Miller said the \uc2 GSA\uc2  has staff at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, adjacent to the White House.\par \par \uc2 "Any of us who have old houses know old houses need a lot of work," he said.\par \par \uc2 Earlier this year, the West Wing was the focus of a long-needed renovation that took place during one of Trump's stints at the golf course and property he owns in Bedminster, N.J.\par \par \uc2 It was at that same property where, according to Golf magazine, Trump said to fellow golfers that the "White House is a real dump."\par \par \uc2 Trump denied making the remark.\par \par \uc2 The president lashed out at the report, calling it "Fake News" and "TOTALLY UNTRUE."\par \par \uc2 "I love the White House, one of the most beautiful buildings (homes) I have ever seen," he wrote on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  in August.\par \par \uc2 The mansion, built in the neoclassical Federal style, is relatively ancient by American building standards, and is unlike the other high-profile homes the president occupied before he was elected.\par \par \uc2 Trump Tower, his home in Manhattan, is a glimmering tower of glass and steel divided into condos that was built in 1983. The main clubhouse at the Bedminster was built in 1939. Construction on Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club began in the 1920s; the estate was built for heiress Marjorie Merriweather Post.\par \par \uc2 Most of the maintenance issues at the White House would be familiar to anyone who's lived in a home with old features: creaky doors; dust buildups; busted air conditioners; the occasional tile in need of replacement.\par \par \uc2 A log on one of the maintenance sheets, which are undated, notes that a door to a West Wing suite used by the National Security Council was getting stuck.\par \par \uc2 "The end users have had to force the door open on more than one occasion," the entry notes.\par \par \uc2 While most of the requests are unnamed \u8212\'20\'14 at times attributed only to a "tenant" \u8212\'20\'14 the logs note a few made by Sean Spicer, when he was still press secretary.\par \par \uc2 He requested a safe be removed from his office and a small, "skinny" banquet table be brought in its place.\par \par \uc2 He asked for a printer and a table.\par \par \uc2 And he wanted a coin display case to showcase his challenge coins, the ceremonial coins that are kept by some members of the military.\par \par \uc2 See the full NBC Washington report here.\par \par \uc2 Read more:\par \par \uc2 'It might be that I did a mistake,' says the man who claims he helped deactivate Trump's \uc2 Twitter\uc2  account\par \par \uc2 Kate Steinle case: Trump fumes after jury acquits \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  charged in San Francisco killing\par \par \uc2 A woman's bold campaign ad points out the one thing she doesn't have\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020171201edc1004xu\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

But Hari Kondabolu has a problem with Apu.\b0\par\par\uc2 By Lavanya Ramanathan \par \uc2 1,433 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 November 2017\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2017, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 "Thank you, come again!"\par \par \uc2 That phrase, made famous by "The Simpsons," has haunted Hari Kondabolu for nearly 30 years. Though "taunted" may be the better word.\par \par \uc2 The Brooklyn-based stand-up comedian and child of Indian immigrants can't even recall the first time he heard the jeer hurled his way. "When it happens so regularly," he says, "it's like asking me, 'Can you remember specific times you took the subway?'\u8202\'20\'0A"\par \par \uc2 "Kids were looking for some angle to make fun of somebody, and you don't know much about Indian people, so what are your options?" he muses.\par \par \uc2 Gandhi.\par \par \uc2 The guy who served monkey brains for dinner in "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom."\par \par \uc2 Or Apu Nahasapeemapetilon, the Indian-born convenience store clerk on "The Simpsons."\par \par \uc2 In the hit \uc2 Fox\uc2  show's sea of yellow-skinned Springfielders, Apu stood out for his brown skin. (And probably for the Ganesha statue gracing his Kwik-E-Mart counter.) But mostly, Apu imprinted himself on the viewer's psyche with his accent, a clucking singsong that made "Thank you, come again!" a meme before memes existed.\par \par \uc2 At first, it didn't seem so nefarious to Kondabolu, who is now 35.\par \par \uc2 The TV shows of the era didn't "look anything like where I grew up," he says. "So being able to see an Indian face, even if it was a cartoon, that's all I wanted: to exist."\par \par \uc2 But now, Kondabolu, whose comedy album, "Mainstream American Comic," reached No.\u160\'00\'A02 on the Billboard comedy charts last year, is examining whether the chattering cartoon immigrant did more harm than good as a representation of Indian Americans. He's taking on the slushee-slinging shopkeeper in "The Problem With Apu," debuting on TruTV on Nov. 19. The hour-long documentary includes interviews with actors and comics of South Asian heritage, who discuss not only the cartoon character but also how their lives have been affected by the stereotypes of South Asians swimming around in the pop culture pool.\par \par \uc2 Kondabolu, who also is an executive producer of the film, talks with Kal Penn of "Harold and Kumar" fame (who immediately voices his contempt for Apu); "Master of None" star Aziz Ansari; and actress Whoopi Goldberg, who maintains a collection of racist depictions of African Americans from a not-so-distant past and quickly begins to see Apu's place in it.\par \par \uc2 The comedian is keenly aware that taking on Apu is akin to dragging "The Simpsons" behemoth itself. And that the millions of Americans who have glowing memories of Bart and Co. will bristle at the idea they may have laughed at something racist.\par \par \uc2 But he wants viewers to see how insidious such characterizations can be and how they continue to thrive.\par \par \uc2 "You start to feel embarrassed to be an Indian," he says. "Because there's only one representation."\par \par \uc2 A not-quite-normal universe\par \par \uc2 Apu didn't appear until a few episodes into the first season of "The Simpsons," but from its 1989 debut, the show was a cultural touchstone. A biting prime-time satire disguised to look like a Saturday morning cartoon, it appealed to both adults and kids, as if it spoke two languages at once.\par \par \uc2 In many ways, what makes it difficult for Kondabolu to argue that Apu is a particularly stereotypical depiction is that the show is teeming with caricatures: blithering drunks, soulless billionaires, closeted gay men, fleabag clowns \u8212\'20\'14 you get it.\par \par \uc2 Kondabolu is bracing for the tidal wave of, "Oh, you're a killjoy, and you hate comedy and you hate 'The Simpsons' because you criticize it."\par \par \uc2 "That's not true," he says. "I was raised on 'The Simpsons,' and 'The Simpsons' critiqued popular culture. So what I'm doing is in the tradition of 'The Simpsons' as far as I'm concerned."\par \par \uc2 Through a spokeswoman, "The Simpsons" creator Matt Groening and actor Hank Azaria, who voices Apu, declined requests for comment on Kondabolu's film.\par \par \uc2 From the opening credits, the world of 'The Simpsons' was full of cues that "things aren't quite normal," says John Ortved, author of "The Simpsons: An Uncensored, Unauthorized History."\par \par \uc2 The animators designed a universe of people who were banana yellow, with blue hair and exaggerated features. "These aren't people who represent humanity, who represent the culture," Ortved says. "They're obviously not going for a human look." But there were exceptions: Dr. Hibbert, modeled after Dr. Huxtable from "The Cosby Show," was clearly African American; Apu was brown; and a slew of odd characters who turned up from time to time were also clear reminders that race exists, even in "The Simpsons."\par \par \uc2 The show may not have looked like the real world, but its story lines and themes smacked of it. Apu has been mistaken for a terrorist at the border, he has revealed that he's an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  and has faced the threat of deportation.\par \par \uc2 And he has been a cheap huckster, selling spoiled goods at the Kwik-E-Mart and shooting at customers with a rifle. He submitted to a marriage arranged by his parents and became the father of eight squirming brown babies. And he is never without his accent, which isn't exactly traceable to any actual region of India.\par \par \uc2 Apu, says Michael Melamedoff, director of the documentary, arrived on the air at a time when South Asians were becoming more visible in American life \u8212\'20\'14 a major boom in Asian immigration occurred in the 1980s and '90s.\par \par \uc2 "The Simpsons" came only a few years after sex-hungry Long Duk Dong in "Sixteen Candles"; "Big Trouble in Little China," which was filled with Asian gangsters and Orientalist mysticism; and "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom."\par \par \uc2 "So of course he comes to life in the guise of a stereotype," Melamedoff says. "Was this kind of race-baiting humor more acceptable in American culture then? One-hundred percent."\par \par \uc2 Bringing up Apu\par \par \uc2 Apu was on the air more than two decades before Kondabolu decided to call the character out.\par \par \uc2 In 2012, Mindy Kaling had just landed her own show, the first starring a woman of South Asian descent, and Kondabolu, then a writer for W. Kamau Bell's FX show, "Totally Biased," set out to explain why her success mattered to others. It meant talking about the biggest Indian character on television up to that point. It meant bringing up Apu.\par \par \uc2 "Talking about this stuff felt kind of corny. To me, it felt like it had been done to death," Kondabolu says. Bell saw it differently. "Kamau said, 'Your community has been talking about this for 20 years. The rest of the country doesn't notice it, doesn't think it's a thing. This is new.'\u8201\'20\'09"\par \par \uc2 So Kondabolu began by describing to the show's audience what Apu looked like to him: "A cartoon character voiced by a white guy. A white guy doing an impression of a white guy making fun of my father."\par \par \uc2 Azaria has won a handful of Emmy awards for his work on "The Simpsons." Three times, his work as Apu was cited in his win.\par \par \uc2 The original writing room was "very reflective of late '80s-early '90s writing rooms," says Ortved. "It was a lot of white men."\par \par \uc2 "Do I think 'The Simpsons' was ignorant or intentionally racist? No," he says. "I also don't think when they were thinking about the voice of Apu, they were thinking too strongly about the South Asian American communities and how they might react to it."\par \par \uc2 Kondabolu says his goal isn't to shame the show or demand Apu's erasure.\par \par \uc2 "It's already been 30 years," and the impact has already been made," he says. "For me it's about getting more diverse roles. It's about writing rooms being more diverse, people actually sharing their own stories as opposed to other people sharing it for them."\par \par \uc2 "The Problem with Apu," says Melamedoff, whose own family emigrated from Argentina, is about "how we succeed and fail representing minority voices, and elevating minority voices so they can represent themselves."\par \par \uc2 "I spent a lot of time revisiting Apu episodes," he says. "Of course, the character has moments of real wit and insight, because the writing team at 'The Simpsons' was great. But a lot of those moments are also blanketed by very cheap jokes that come at the expense of South Asian culture and South Asian experiences.\par \par \uc2 "Apu, I just can't look at him the same way anymore."\par \par \uc2 lavanya.ramanathan@washpost.com\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020171121edbl0063h\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved \par \par \uc2 "Thank you, come again!"\par \par \uc2 That phrase, made famous by "The Simpsons," has haunted Hari Kondabolu for nearly 30 years. Though "taunted" may be the better word.\par \par \uc2 The Brooklyn-based stand-up comedian and child of Indian immigrants can't even recall the first time he heard the jeer hurled his way. "When it happens so regularly," he says, "it's like asking me, 'Can you remember specific times you took the subway?' "\par \par \uc2 "Kids were looking for some angle to make fun of somebody, and you don't know much about Indian people, so what are your options?" he muses.\par \par \uc2 Gandhi.\par \par \uc2 The guy who served monkey brains for dinner in "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom."\par \par \uc2 Or Apu Nahasapeemapetilon, the Indian-born convenience store clerk on "The Simpsons."\par \par \uc2 In the hit \uc2 Fox\uc2  show's sea of yellow-skinned Springfielders, Apu stood out for his brown skin. (And probably for the Ganesha statue gracing his Kwik-E-Mart counter.) But mostly, Apu imprinted himself on the viewer's psyche with his accent, a clucking singsong that made "Thank you, come again!" a meme before memes existed.\par \par \uc2 At first, it didn't seem so nefarious to Kondabolu, who is now 35.\par \par \uc2 The TV shows of the era didn't "look anything like where I grew up," he says. "So being able to see an Indian face, even if it was a cartoon, that's all I wanted: to exist."\par \par \uc2 But now, Kondabolu, whose comedy album, "Mainstream American Comic," reached No. 2 on the Billboard comedy charts last year, is examining whether the chattering cartoon immigrant did more harm than good as a representation of Indian Americans. He's taking on the slushee-slinging shopkeeper in "The Problem With Apu," debuting on TruTV on Nov. 19. The hour-long documentary includes interviews with actors and comics of South Asian heritage, who discuss not only the cartoon character but also how their lives have been affected by the stereotypes of South Asians swimming around in the pop culture pool.\par \par \uc2 Kondabolu, who also is an executive producer of the film, talks with Kal Penn of "Harold and Kumar" fame (who immediately voices his contempt for Apu); "Master of None" star Aziz Ansari; and actress Whoopi Goldberg, who maintains a collection of racist depictions of African Americans from a not-so-distant past and quickly begins to see Apu's place in it.\par \par \uc2 The comedian is keenly aware that taking on Apu is akin to dragging "The Simpsons" behemoth itself. And that the millions of Americans who have glowing memories of Bart and Co. will bristle at the idea they may have laughed at something racist.\par \par \uc2 But he wants viewers to see how insidious such characterizations can be and how they continue to thrive.\par \par \uc2 "You start to feel embarrassed to be an Indian," he says. "Because there's only one representation."\par \par \uc2 A not-quite-normal universe\par \par \uc2 Apu didn't appear until a few episodes into the first season of "The Simpsons," but from its 1989 debut, the show was a cultural touchstone. A biting prime-time satire disguised to look like a Saturday morning cartoon, it appealed to both adults and kids, as if it spoke two languages at once.\par \par \uc2 In many ways, what makes it difficult for Kondabolu to argue that Apu is a particularly stereotypical depiction is that the show is teeming with caricatures: blithering drunks, soulless billionaires, closeted gay men, fleabag clowns - you get it.\par \par \uc2 Kondabolu is bracing for the tidal wave of, "Oh, you're a killjoy, and you hate comedy and you hate 'The Simpsons' because you criticize it."\par \par \uc2 "That's not true," he says. "I was raised on 'The Simpsons,' and 'The Simpsons' critiqued popular culture. So what I'm doing is in the tradition of 'The Simpsons' as far as I'm concerned."\par \par \uc2 Through a spokeswoman, "The Simpsons" creator Matt Groening and actor Hank Azaria, who voices Apu, declined requests for comment on Kondabolu's film.\par \par \uc2 From the opening credits, the world of 'The Simpsons' was full of cues that "things aren't quite normal," says John Ortved, author of "The Simpsons: An Uncensored, Unauthorized History."\par \par \uc2 The animators designed a universe of people who were banana yellow, with blue hair and exaggerated features. "These aren't people who represent humanity, who represent the culture," Ortved says. "They're obviously not going for a human look." But there were exceptions: Dr. Hibbert, modeled after Dr. Huxtable from "The Cosby Show," was clearly African American; Apu was brown; and a slew of odd characters who turned up from time to time were also clear reminders that race exists, even in "The Simpsons."\par \par \uc2 The show may not have looked like the real world, but its story lines and themes smacked of it. Apu has been mistaken for a terrorist at the border, he has revealed that he's an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  and has faced the threat of deportation.\par \par \uc2 And he has been a cheap huckster, selling spoiled goods at the Kwik-E-Mart and shooting at customers with a rifle. He submitted to a marriage arranged by his parents and became the father of eight squirming brown babies. And he is never without his accent, which isn't exactly traceable to any actual region of India.\par \par \uc2 Apu, says Michael Melamedoff, director of the documentary, arrived on the air at a time when South Asians were becoming more visible in American life - a major boom in Asian immigration occurred in the 1980s and '90s.\par \par \uc2 "The Simpsons" came only a few years after sex-hungry Long Duk Dong in "Sixteen Candles"; "Big Trouble in Little China," which was filled with Asian gangsters and Orientalist mysticism; and "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom."\par \par \uc2 "So of course he comes to life in the guise of a stereotype," Melamedoff says. "Was this kind of race-baiting humor more acceptable in American culture then? One-hundred percent."\par \par \uc2 Bringing up Apu\par \par \uc2 Apu was on the air more than two decades before Kondabolu decided to call the character out.\par \par \uc2 In 2012, Mindy Kaling had just landed her own show, the first starring a woman of South Asian descent, and Kondabolu, then a writer for W. Kamau Bell's FX show, "Totally Biased," set out to explain why her success mattered to others. It meant talking about the biggest Indian character on television up to that point. It meant bringing up Apu.\par \par \uc2 "Talking about this stuff felt kind of corny. To me, it felt like it had been done to death," Kondabolu says. Bell saw it differently. "Kamau said, 'You're community has been talking about this for 20 years. The rest of the country doesn't notice it, doesn't think it's a thing. This is new.' "\par \par \uc2 So Kondabolu began by describing to the show's audience what Apu looked like to him: "A cartoon character voiced by a white guy. A white guy doing an impression of a white guy making fun of my father."\par \par \uc2 Azaria has won a handful of Emmy awards for his work on "The Simpsons." Three times, his work as Apu was cited in his win.\par \par \uc2 The original writing room was "very reflective of late '80s-early '90s writing rooms," says Ortved. "It was a lot of white men."\par \par \uc2 "Do I think 'The Simpsons' was ignorant or intentionally racist? No," he says. "I also don't think when they were thinking about the voice of Apu, they were thinking too strongly about the South Asian American communities and how they might react to it."\par \par \uc2 Kondabolu says his goal isn't to shame the show or demand Apu's erasure.\par \par \uc2 "It's already been 30 years," and the impact has already been made," he says. "For me it's about getting more diverse roles. It's about writing rooms being more diverse, people actually sharing their own stories as opposed to other people sharing it for them."\par \par \uc2 "The Problem With Apu," says Melamedoff, whose own family emigrated from Argentina, is about "how we succeed and fail representing minority voices, and elevating minority voices so they can represent themselves."\par \par \uc2 "I spent a lot of time revisiting Apu episodes," he says. "Of course, the character has moments of real wit and insight, because the writing team at 'The Simpsons' was great. But a lot of those moments are also blanketed by very cheap jokes that come at the expense of South Asian culture and South Asian experiences.\par \par \uc2 "Apu, I just can't look at him the same way anymore."\par \par \uc2 lavanya.ramanathan@washpost.com \par \par \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com\par \par \uc2 WP20171112sa-apu1112\par \par \uc2 Document WP00000020171112edbc0003r\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

But don't write its obituary just yet. ; After a loss in Virginia, will Republicans decide to fish with Trump or cut bait? And do they need to? Don't be too sure.\b0\par\par\uc2 By Aaron Blake \par \uc2 782 \uc2 words\par \uc2 8 November 2017\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2017, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 President Trump sent a pretty clear message when he tweeted about \uc2 Ed Gillespie\uc2 's loss after the Virginia governor's race Tuesday night: I reserve the right to throw any GOP candidate who doesn't bear-hug me under the bus.\par \par \uc2 Ed Gillespie\uc2  worked hard but did not embrace me or what I stand for. Don't forget, Republicans won 4 out of 4 House seats, and with the economy doing record numbers, we will continue to win, even bigger than before!\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 8, 2017\par \par \uc2 And plenty of the post-election analysis has focused on whether Republicans need to bear-hug him -- whether they can embrace the kind of "Trumpism without Trump" strategy that Gillespie tried in Virginia. The results would suggest not so much, as Michael Tackett wrote in the \uc2 New York Times\uc2 :\par \par \uc2 Lessons from off-year elections can be overdrawn, but the Virginia race strongly suggests that Republicans running in swing states will have to choose a side rather than try to straddle an uncomfortable line. Mr. Trump's blunt force, all-or-nothing approach has worked in deeply conservative areas, but Republicans will have trouble replicating that in certain states in the midterms next year when faced with a diverse, highly educated electorate like the one in Virginia.\par \par \uc2 So is it now A Time for Choosing? Will Republicans decide to fish with Trump or cut bait? And do they need to?\par \par \uc2 Don't be too sure.\par \par \uc2 Yes, the results in Virginia would seem to suggest that not fully embracing Trump while echoing his nationalist, culture-warrior messaging didn't exactly work. But as Tackett notes, we're talking about one race. We're also talking about movement of a few points in a tough state for Trump and Trumpism; Trump lost Virginia by five points last year, and Gillespie lost by nine points Tuesday. While other swing states trended toward Trump, Virginia continued its long-running path away from the GOP.\par \par \uc2 Second, the last time there was a big race featuring a highly educated electorate and a GOP candidate who conspicuously kept Trump at arm's length, it was Georgia special election candidate Karen Handel (R). She won, even beating Trump's margin in the well-to-do Atlanta suburbs by a few points.\par \par \uc2 No two races are created equal, but Georgia's 6th District is demographically similar to Virginia. It's 62 percent white, compared to Virginia's 63 percent. Its median income ranks toward the top nationwide, as does Virginia's. It is mostly highly educated suburbs, and Virginia has lots of those.\par \par \uc2 The difference, of course, is that Georgia's 6th was much more GOP-leaning before Trump came along, having delivered wide margins for previous Republicans who ran there. Handel may have slightly bettered Trump's numbers, but she far underperformed previous GOP candidates there.\par \par \uc2 Still, the point is that were talking about movement on the margins here, relative to 2016. Gillespie did a few points worse than Trump with his "Trumpism without Trump" message, while Handel did slightly better while not fully embracing Trump. In the New Jersey governor's race Tuesday, Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno (R) ran with a late message focused on "sanctuary cities" and \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  crime and actually did slightly better than both Trump last year and \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2  in 2012, taking 42.5 percent of the vote in her loss to Gov.-elect \uc2 Phil Murphy\uc2  (D). And she did it despite being hampered by hugely unpopular outgoing Gov. Chris Christie's 22 percent approval rating.\par \par \uc2 The other data point that's worth emphasizing here is that Gillespie didn't have a turnout problem. In fact, the 1.18 million votes he's got so far is 17 percent more than 2013 GOP nominee Ken Cuccinelli received (1.01 million) in another closely watched race. The problem for Gillespie was that Democratic turnout was up even more. In other words, it didn't seem that Gillespie's choice not to fully embrace Trump turned off would-be voters who support Trump.\par \par \uc2 There is certainly evidence to suggest "Trumpism without Trump" isn't the best electoral strategy, but it's still not a totally compelling case. And Republicans in swing areas who have been gingerly dancing around Trump's tweets and controversies will probably still feel the need to do so. This strategy, after all, has never really been one of choice.\par \par \uc2 Document WPCOM00020171108edb80069b\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 volokh-conspiracy\par {\*\bkmkstart toc98}{\*\bkmkend toc98}\b \uc2 Short Circuit: A roundup of recent federal court decisions \b0\par\par\uc2 By Eugene Volokh \par \uc2 982 \uc2 words\par \uc2 30 October 2017\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2017, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 (Here is the latest edition of the Institute for Justice's weekly Short Circuit newsletter, written by John Ross.)\par \par \uc2 New on the podcast: the right to engage in prostitution, gun sales too close to residences, self-storage too close to a school, and leafleting too close to a circus.\par \par \uc2 * Seventeen-year-old \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  in gov't custody seeks an abortion. Gov't: To do so, you must first find foster parents in the U.S. or agree to depart the country. D.C. Circuit: No.\par \par \uc2 * Consumers allege that eye-drop droppers render eye drops that are too large, unavoidably waste pricey medication, in violation of several states' consumer protection laws. District court: That is not a sufficiently serious injury. Third Circuit (over a dissent): It is.\par \par \uc2 * A Philadelphia landlord need not continuously renew the lease of longtime (model) tenants, says two-thirds of a Third Circuit panel, despite statutory language saying tenants on (a particular type of) rent assistance "may elect to remain."\par \par \uc2 * Drug suspect (who turns out to be innocent) is arrested in April, sits in Choctaw County, Miss. jail without seeing a judge until August. Sheriff: The court was out of session. Fifth Circuit: "There is no sanction, historical or modern," for such a delay. Even though the sheriff had a warrant and a grand jury indictment, detaining the suspect for that long without seeing a judge violated her due process rights.\par \par \uc2 * Allegation: Informant making drug buy inside Pearl, Miss. house signals that she is in danger. Officers charge into different house, point guns at innocent family, including mother with an infant, and rough up the father. They don't announce themselves; the son calls 911 to report armed intruders. Fifth Circuit: No qualified immunity. (And in unrelated news from Pearl this week: mother forbidden contact with infant for 14 months over unpaid court fees.)\par \par \uc2 * Sixth Circuit: No need to disturb the convictions, sentences of five Cleveland men set up by ATF to rob nonexistent drug house. Concurrence (referencing an investigative news report): These stings should cease. Rather than targeting violent criminals, the gov't is expending its resources to induce small-time crooks (typically low-income minorities), including, in this case, a gainfully employed young man with no criminal record, into crimes carrying lengthy sentences.\par \par \uc2 * Detroit oil refinery has been in continuous operation since 1930. In 2016, nearby residents sue, alleging that noise, odors, and contaminants from the refinery interfere with the enjoyment of their properties. District court: The alleged injuries commenced more than three years ago; the deadline to file suit has passed. Sixth Circuit: Reversed. Each day's discharges are a new injury.\par \par \uc2 * Lincoln County, Mo. officer sexually assaults drug court participants in their homes, in jail, in his patrol car. In 2015, the Eighth Circuit rules that five victims cannot sue the sheriff for negligent supervision. Their claims against the county go to a jury, however, which awards each of them at least $500k, and this week the Eighth Circuit affirms the verdict.\par \par \uc2 * Man is convicted of grizzly murder. Must he bear the penalty? At a bare minimum, he should get a new trial, says the Ninth Circuit, as it might have been self-defense.\par \par \uc2 * Motorist sprints away from traffic stop. Las Vegas officer apprehends him, proceed to tase him more or less continuously for over 90 seconds (even after backup arrived, and for 10 seconds simultaneously with another officer), though the motorist neither resists nor threatens officers. He dies. Ninth Circuit: Which might well violate the Fourth Amendment. This goes to a jury.\par \par \uc2 * The majority of a Ninth Circuit panel upholds Montana's limits on contributions to political candidates \u8212\'20\'14 despite no evidence that there is a problem with actual corruption in the state \u8212\'20\'14 because the limits address "the risk of \u8230\'20\'26 perceived quid pro quo corruption."\par \par \uc2 * Consumer pays a premium for flushable wipes, finds they are not actually flushable. False advertising? District court: They didn't damage your pipes or the sewage system. Case dismissed. Ninth Circuit: Reversed. She alleged the wipes don't disintegrate in suitably timely fashion, which is enough for the case to proceed.\par \par \uc2 * Woman buys high-end cars, leases them to owner of rental car business. He stops paying her; she defaults on loan payments. But wait! He is an \uc2 FBI\uc2  informant. Did the gov't have a duty to protect her against such losses? It did not, says the Eleventh Circuit.\par \par \uc2 * Rap artist is murdered outside hospital while his girlfriend is giving birth. Yikes! The man police and prosecutors think is responsible is an \uc2 FBI\uc2  informant (same gentleman as above). Did the gov't violate a duty of care? The Eleventh Circuit says no.\par \par \uc2 * FBI agent reports to superior that, among other misdeeds, two pilots used agency aircraft to solicit prostitutes. He's fired. Retaliation? By law, he can challenge his dismissal either internally or in front of an independent agency. He picks the independent agency. Federal Circuit (en banc): Bummer. Because you can't raise a whistleblower defense unless you appeal internally. Dissent: Parsing the relevant provisions reminds one of "predicting divine will by studying animal entrails."\par \par \uc2 Esteban Narez wants to earn a living as a farrier, and Bob Smith, who owns California's only full-time horseshoeing school, wants to teach him. But California prohibits Bob from enrolling Esteban because Esteban lacks a high school diploma. Which is a real shame because the pay and work flexibility from shoeing horses would be a significant improvement for Esteban, who currently works seven days a week doing odd jobs on a ranch to support his family. This month, Esteban and Bob filed a First Amendment lawsuit, arguing it's unconstitutional for the state to require Esteban to pass a high school equivalency exam unrelated to horseshoeing before he can go to trade school.

A letter recently arrived, expressing remorse. \b0\par\par\uc2 By Eli Rosenberg \par \uc2 1,124 \uc2 words\par \uc2 26 October 2017\par \uc2 Washington Post.com\par \uc2 WPCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2017, The Washington Post Co.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The letter arrived for Peter Hirschmann with a postmark from Nuremberg, Germany, where he and his family had escaped from Nazis nearly 80 years ago.\par \par \uc2 The words, neat script in three pages, brought the 92-year-old resident of Maplewood, N.J., to tears. They were a message of remorse, sent by a German woman who began to investigate how her grandfather had acquired Hirschmann's family home after it had been seized by the \uc2 German government\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Doris Schott-Neuse, a 46-year-old civil servant, wanted to express her regret and ask Hirschmann for forgiveness, according to the Associated Press.\par \par \uc2 "I am deeply ashamed for what us Germans did to yourself, your family and to your friends and relatives and to the members of the Nuremberg Jewish community," she wrote. "It is hardly bearable to start thinking about the details \u8212\'20\'14 what a horror and nightmare it must have been to live through this."\par \par \uc2 In an interview with the AP, Hirschmann recalled his old home on the outskirts of Nuremberg, an old Bavarian town where Nazis had created the Nuremberg Laws, a series of rules that deprived Jews of citizenship, in 1935.\par \par \uc2 Hirschmann's father Julius was a businessman whose success was evident in the two-story, three-bedroom house.\par \par \uc2 "It was probably one of the nicer homes around according to the standards of the day," Hirschmann said.\par \par \uc2 He remembers the changes his parents started to make after Nazis came to power and began implementing policies against the country's Jewish population. After Jews were banned from using a local pool, his parents set up sprinklers for the children in their back yard.\par \par \uc2 "All of a sudden there was a sign up there: 'Juden und Hunde Verboten,' which means Jews and dogs not allowed," Hirschmann recalled. The family fled Germany in 1939.\par \par \uc2 Schott-Neuse had begun to look into her own family history and how they came to acquire the house a few years after the Hirschmanns left.\par \par \uc2 Schott-Neuse, who lived in the house until she was five, dug through the city's archives and found that Nazis had seized Hirschmann's home. By 1941, Willi Muhr, her grandfather, was listed as its owner.\par \par \uc2 Schott-Neuse said her aunt, who inherited the house and later sold it when Schott-Neuse was five, told her that her grandparents had acquired the home after helping the previous owners escape to the United States. But Schott-Neuse said she had come to doubt the story about her grandparents after learning about the house's history.\par \par \uc2 "I don't know if I want to believe that any longer," she said. "I thought he bought it directly from the Jewish owners but this doesn't seem to be true."\par \par \uc2 Instead, she has begun to assume her grandfather was connected to Nazis, given how nice the house was.\par \par \uc2 "That is what prompted me to write the letter, because I thought that the family also doesn't know what happened and I wanted to say I'm so sorry, because it's not done and over," she said.\par \par \uc2 In her letter to Hirschmann, she wrote that the Holocaust and Nazi years were "lessons filled with numbers, data, and facts of the deeds of 'them' \u8212\'20\'14 the Nazis \u8212\'20\'14 and we felt that all that was something which was awful but that it happened in a faraway past. And I did not connect these history lessons to my family. My sister and I enjoyed a very happy childhood and connecting family with gruesome horrors did not work. I know that this was the same for my friends."\par \par \uc2 The Hirschmann family was later paid restitution for the house that amounted to about a tenth of its prewar value, the AP reported.\par \par \uc2 Hirschmann and his family were able to flee Nazi Germany; his parents sent him and his brother to live with a relative in England in the hopes that Adolf Hitler's time in office would be short, he said in an interview with The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 But as conditions worsened for the Jews in Germany, Hirschmann's parents were granted visas to come the United States in August 1939, just weeks before Hitler invaded Poland in what historians consider the start of World War II.\par \par \uc2 By the end of that year, the whole family was reunited in Newark, Hirschmann's parents working menial jobs but happy to be living free. Hirschmann got a waiver to join the Army after his 18th birthday in 1942, even though he was still a German citizen.\par \par \uc2 An infantryman, he fought in the Battle of the Bulge in 1944, the last major German offensive of the war, where he was captured along with other American troops. He spent the last five months of the war in a prisoner of war camp \u8212\'20\'14 he still remembers the dates, Dec. 16, 1944, to May 8, 1945 \u8212\'20\'14 telling his captors that he had learned German in high school to obscure his past and ethnicity.\par \par \uc2 "If he had found out my background, I would have been shot without any explanation," he told AP.\par \par \uc2 Back in the United States, Hirschmann raised two children with his wife Merle, and had a successful career as an accountant and real estate broker. They have five grandchildren. He has been married for 55 years, and still goes to work at the office of the real estate company he owns just about every day.\par \par \uc2 He and his family had visited the home in Nuremberg decades ago during a trip to Germany, sitting down for tea with the young family that had purchased the place.\par \par \uc2 Then, decades later the house came back to him again in the form of Schott-Neuse's letter, which was mailed to his office.\par \par \uc2 "How she got the address to my office, I don't yet know," Hirschmann said.\par \par \uc2 "I give her a lot of credit for researching and finding him," his wife, Merle, said.\par \par \uc2 Hirschmann wrote an email back to Schott-Neuse, according to the AP, telling her that she was blameless and writing that he was touched by her letter.\par \par \uc2 "You had the option to ignore it and instead you confronted it," he wrote. "My tears reflect the fervent hope that the humanity, dignity, and compassion you have shown is shared by others of your generation and the generations to follow."\par \par \uc2 Read more:\par \par \uc2 An \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  killed a woman and was used to justify Trump's wall.
