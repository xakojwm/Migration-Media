Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning. All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Now that the Wisconsin Legislature appears to have gone home for the year, I want to bestow an award to the legislator who went beyond the call of duty this past session to gum up the works - state Rep. Joe Sanfelippo, the Republican from West Allis.\par \par \uc2 It wouldn't surprise any observer of state politics if Sanfelippo set some modern-day record for being a human wrecking ball, sabotaging public interest legislation by inserting his own biases and skewed political agenda at just the right moment.\par \par \uc2 A skilled bomb thrower is he.\par \par \uc2 The prime example is what he did to the bipartisan bill aimed at preventing future backlogs of sexual assault kit testing. The measure had been authored by a bipartisan health care coalition to create the first statutory guidelines on how to process sexual assault kits, which can contain evidence that is crucial to finding sexual predators or freeing the wrongly convicted.\par \par \uc2 It was aimed a preventing another backlog like the one just a few years ago that saw the kits go untested for months and even years, a situation that denied justice for survivors of sexual assault by letting the attackers go free. Under the bill, hospitals and others collecting evidence for the kits would be required to immediately send them to the State Crime Lab for testing.\par \par \uc2 It was passed by the state Senate with ease, but when it came over to the Assembly, Sanfelippo didn't care about justice delayed or even denied. As chair of the Assembly's Committee on Health, he refused to call a public hearing on a bill that most regarded as good legislation. And then as the session neared its end, he found all sorts of problems with the bill and decided to insert an amendment to pander to his conservative constituency.\par \par \uc2 He decided that the bill should include a requirement that student rape victims be immediately eligible to attend a voucher school and one to require law enforcement to notify ICE if the test results point to an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . When Assembly Speaker \uc2 Robin Vos\uc2  decided to go along with Sanfelippo, which he regularly does, it effectively killed the bill for this session.\par \par \uc2 Not only did it now contain provisions that many Democrats didn't like, it would have to be sent back to the Senate for another vote. The result in the end was nothing passed. Rape kit procedures will have to wait another year. Thanks a lot, Joe.\par \par \uc2 But, this is modus operandi for Sanfelippo.\par \par \uc2 Last month, the West Allis Republican succeeded in scuttling a common-sense bill that he had, in fact, originally backed, to allow direct primary care clinics to operate more freely in Wisconsin. The bill included a strict anti-discrimination clause. But, at the last minute, Sanfelippo introduced an amendment that removed sexual orientation, national origin and ancestry from the language, once again thwarting any bipartisan agreement.\par \par \uc2 Sanfelippo's action sparked charges by state Sen. Tim Carpenter, an openly gay legislator from Milwaukee, that the new language amounted to bigotry. It passed the GOP-controlled Assembly and Senate anyhow, but not without rancor sparked by our favorite guy from West Allis.\par \par \uc2 But Joe's handiwork pops up all over the place, whether it's to ridicule gun safety efforts, fight criminal reform legislation to help reduce the prison population and, hence, taxpayers' costs, or push efforts to take local control away from Milwaukee, his favorite punching bag.\par \par \uc2 And to show you how much of a nice guy and team player he is, Sanfelippo didn't have a nice thing to say about fellow Republican, state Sen. Luther Olsen, who announced he's retiring after 25 years in the Legislature.\par \par \uc2 He was "one of the biggest roadblocks to school reform and accountability in the Legislature," snarled Joe. Apparently, Olsen didn't believe in throwing bombs.\par \par \uc2 CREDIT: By Dave Zweifel\par \par \uc2 Document XWST000020200326eg3p00004\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 LOCAL\par {\*\bkmkstart toc1}{\*\bkmkend toc1}\b \uc2 VICTIM ADVOCATES SAY GOP STALLING; LEGISLATURE | SEXUAL-ASSAULT KITS\b0\par\par\uc2 RILEY VETTERKIND \par \uc2 739 \uc2 words\par \uc2 6 February 2020\par \uc2 The Capital Times & Wisconsin State Journal\par \uc2 XWST\par A.3\par \uc2 ISSN:0749405X\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2020 The Capital Times & Wisconsin State Journal.

The Senate passed the bill, but the effort has stalled in the Assembly.\par \par \uc2 Assembly Republicans have declined to advance the bill supported by criminal justice professionals and instead have moved in a different direction, opting to introduce legislation that includes many of the same measures Kaul and Democrats want, but with added controversial provisions related to private-school vouchers and immigration that Democrats reject, putting the entire effort in peril.\par \par \uc2 A spokeswoman for Democratic \uc2 Gov. Tony Evers\uc2  said Republicans "are now putting on a pretty gross and disappointing political display."\par \par \uc2 Advocates accused Republicans of playing politics with people's lives.\par \par \uc2 "This is how you kill a bill," said Ilse Knecht, director of policy and advocacy for the New York-based Joyful Heart Foundation, a sexual-assault victim advocacy group. "We've been involved in reform laws across the country, and I will tell you I have never experienced party politics being injected into this issue in this way."\par \par \uc2 Steffen's revision\par \par \uc2 Last Thursday, Rep. David Steffen, R-Green Bay, who introduced bipartisan sexual-assault kit legislation alongside Democratic Attorney General \uc2 Josh Kaul\uc2  last year, came out with the new bill to give his fellow Republicans another option to consider as the end of the legislative session nears. During a hearing on the bill Wednesday, Steffen explained he introduced the new bill to ensure more GOP support. He said the change was meant to secure at least 50 votes within the Republican caucus before moving a bill to the floor.\par \par \uc2 The bill's introduction came after Rep. Joe Sanfelippo, chairman of the committee tasked with advancing the bipartisan legislation, expressed opposition to Steffen's first bill and wouldn't commit to a public hearing. That bill, which has widespread bipartisan support, would create statutory requirements for who should collect and store sexual-assault kits, and when.\par \par \uc2 Sanfelippo, R-New Berlin, provided a number of objections to the bill, chiefly that it adds more regulation without doing enough to prevent future backlogs. Kaul said such criticisms were unfounded and that the bill makes great strides in mandating law-enforcement agencies comply with new requirements.\par \par \uc2 Sanfelippo said he supports the new bill, which also would create timelines for collecting and storing sexual-assault kits but creates more compressed requirements in some areas.\par \par \uc2 Kaul said he had several issues with the bill.\par \par \uc2 "This bill is a mess and the Legislature should vote it down," Kaul said.\par \par \uc2 Republicans said the private-school voucher provision aims to allow children who are sexually assaulted to leave the school where they may have been victimized. Steffen said a provision requiring authorities to report immigrants in the country illegally was meant to protect \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  women by creating a new deterrent for sexual predators. Kaul also took issue with the bill for mandating a sexual-assault kit tracking program without providing funding for it.\par \par \uc2 'Do your job'\par \par \uc2 Veronica Figueroa, executive director of Unidos, a group combating domestic violence and sexual assault, said the immigration and voucher provisions don't belong in the bill. She said the immigration measures do little to prevent sexual assault because perpetrators who are deported can find their way back to the United States.\par \par \uc2 "We put you in that seat," Figueroa told committee lawmakers. "Do your job and support your communities and stop playing with the lives of survivors."\par \par \uc2 Jacqueline Jaske, an advocate and survivor of sexual assault, criticized Republicans for employing what she called stall tactics to prevent a bill from moving forward.\par \par \uc2 "All of these messages tell victims that they don't matter," Jaske said. "This isn't a political issue for me. I considered myself a Republican and I cannot support this solely Republican bill or the politics replacing victims' rights for justice with a win for their team."\par \par \uc2 CREDIT: RILEY VETTERKIND rvetterkind@madison.com\par \par \uc2 Document XWST000020200207eg260000a\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 OPINION\par {\*\bkmkstart toc2}{\*\bkmkend toc2}\b \uc2 YOUR VIEWS\b0\par\par\uc2 986 \uc2 words\par \uc2 15 April 2019\par \uc2 The Capital Times & Wisconsin State Journal\par \uc2 XWST\par A.9\par \uc2 ISSN:0749405X\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2019 The Capital Times & Wisconsin State Journal.

The politicians talk about it a lot and come back with the same old answers that have not worked.\par \par \uc2 A possible solution I have presented to a couple of my representatives from the Portage area is to raise the state sales tax by 1%. This would be used solely for the repair and maintenance of our state roads. This 1% could not be used for any other purpose.\par \par \uc2 Why should the drivers be the only ones to pay for maintenance? Shouldn't everyone pay to repair our roads? Some people may not have a driver's license, but they use the roads. I don't think a 1% increase is going to break anyone. Do you? I myself would rather pay 1% more in sales tax than 8 cents in gas taxes.\par \par \uc2 Robert G. "Bob" Beahm, Portage\par \par \uc2 Medical marijuana can save lives\par \par \uc2 Forty years ago, I was a newly hired employee of a manufacturer in the Detroit area.\par \par \uc2 On one occasion, I was meeting with the company warehouse manager. While talking with him, I could see he was not feeling well. He told me he was taking chemotherapy for a treatable cancer, but the treatment was making him nauseous. The doctor prescribed anti-nausea, narcotic medication, but it was making him tired and confused.\par \par \uc2 I quietly asked him if he had tried smoking some marijuana to relieve the nausea. He had never tried marijuana, but his situation made him desperate. I told him I might know someone who could help. A few phone calls later, I got him a small bag of pot. I got him a small pipe and explained the process.\par \par \uc2 Several weeks later, I was walking through the warehouse. I saw the manager running toward me. I thought I was in trouble. He ran up to me with tears in his eyes and hugged me. He said I had saved him. He told me he had contemplated suicide.\par \par \uc2 The marijuana had eased the nausea, allowing him to eat normally. It was a good day.\par \par \uc2 Bruce Longfield, Middleton\par \par \uc2 Don't fall for toll road scam\par \par \uc2 Some of our politicians are pushing for toll roads in Wisconsin.\par \par \uc2 Our roads need repairs, but the last thing we need is toll roads. They are just another scam to get your money. The toll roads will be under construction constantly (as a way to convince you to pay more), so you won't be flying from point A to point B.\par \par \uc2 They will probably be sold and resold to private corporations, and the tolls will always be rising. For example, Indiana's tollway belongs to an Australian corporation. Then you'll be forced to buy a toll pass. If you don't, you'll be waiting to pay at the one open "cash" booth for 5 minutes. They'll punish you.\par \par \uc2 Take a trip from the Wisconsin border to Chicago on I-90 and you'll see how much in tolls it will cost you just to drive on the road. You'll be in shock. Only a few cents from each dollar with actually go to the roads.\par \par \uc2 Don't fall for it.\par \par \uc2 Jerzy Matian, Mauston\par \par \uc2 Trump shouldn't get another term\par \par \uc2 Why should we give \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  four more years as president? All he does is think about his wall and watch television for hours at a time when he is supposed to be working. And some people want to have him as president four more years?\par \par \uc2 In any business, if an employee did that he would be fired and not rewarded as President Trump wants voters to do. It is time for his base to put their thinking caps on. What if North Korea threatened us with nuclear war? Would you trust President Trump to handle such a situation? Does he know what to do?\par \par \uc2 A man who watches television most of his day and doesn't read books does not have the intelligence and work ethic needed to be president.\par \par \uc2 He even was a poor businessman. He went bankrupt six times, and most banks refused to lend him anymore money. And we should give him four more years as president? That is a ridiculous idea.\par \par \uc2 Diana Vance, Monroe\par \par \uc2 Critics can focus on their districts\par \par \uc2 On April 7, the State Journal the published the letter "All-female School Board isn't diverse," bad-mouthing Madison public schools. On April 8, it published another letter, "Teachers need to be respected," doing the same.\par \par \uc2 Interestingly, the author of the first letter is from Oshkosh and the author of the second letter is from Windsor - neither of which are within the bounds of the Madison School District. On Election Day, several thousand people who really do live in the Madison School District and have financial and personal stakes in the district went to the polls and made their wishes quite clear.\par \par \uc2 Backseat driving can be a lot of fun if you have no stake in the results. Maybe it's time these letters writers offer their educational expertise to the school districts where they actually live.\par \par \uc2 Michael Reichert, Madison\par \par \uc2 Only legal residents deserve licenses\par \par \uc2 If you hold the coat of someone who is committing a crime, wouldn't you be considered aiding and abetting that crime?\par \par \uc2 How can you justify giving an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  a legal Wisconsin driver's license. It makes absolutely no sense to me. Don't tell me the streets will be safer.\par \par \uc2 So in their infinite wisdom, our lawmakers are considering giving illegal immigrants the coveted driver's license?

Yet I would like to see some changes made to the tuition freeze.\par \par \uc2 I support \uc2 Gov. Tony Evers\uc2 ' proposal to continue the in-state tuition freeze for UW students. Being a resident of Wisconsin attending UW, I am grateful that I can afford my tuition without going into debt.\par \par \uc2 But nonresident students don't have it as nice as I do. Most of my friends live out of state and are struggling with the amount of loans needed to achieve a degree.\par \par \uc2 It was recently announced that their tuition - which is already $36,805 without housing, meals, and books included - is increasing next year. Giving out-of-state students a tuition freeze or reduction would potentially lead to a more inviting university and could bring in more diversity to a predominantly white campus.\par \par \uc2 Gov. Evers should fight aggressively for his proposal to freeze tuition for in-state students but amend it to include out-of-state students to create a more inviting and diverse university.\par \par \uc2 Karissa Niederkorn, Madison\par \par \uc2 Trump is acting more like a dictator\par \par \uc2 In 1943, when I became 18, I Joined the Army and was trained as an infantryman. After training, I was sent to Burma in a ranger regiment. I spent nearly a year fighting the Japanese through the jungles and mountains of Burma.\par \par \uc2 We fought to save our democratic way of life. That way of life includes a democratically elected government and Congress, which passes laws, and an executive who carries out those laws.\par \par \uc2 In less than two years as president, \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  has become a dictator. He ignores the Constitution. He lacks political knowledge, so he makes poor decisions. He ignores advice from his government experts, but naively believes foreign officials and enemies. He is ignorant, incompetent, moody and cannot stand anyone who disagrees with him.\par \par \uc2 If he is not impeached by 2020, his supporters must join those of us who voted against him to remove him from office. At age 94, I cannot march or protest, but I am working on living long enough to vote against him in 2020.\par \par \uc2 Richard Bates, Baraboo\par \par \uc2 Stop the wildlife killing contests\par \par \uc2 For over 30 years I was a high school biology teacher, after which I retired to northern Wisconsin.\par \par \uc2 Recently, I became aware of people who try to kill as many animals as they can in the name of entertainment for prizes. One such event targeting coyotes was held near Tomahawk in January.\par \par \uc2 In my younger years, I did my share of hunting, but this practice goes against what my father taught me and what I taught my kids. It gives hunters a bad name and shows a lack of respect for the animals killed.\par \par \uc2 My grandkids come to visit me often, but I know neither they nor I will forget the time we saw a bobcat in the yard, or the summer the fox had a den near our house. We feel privileged to be able to see these animals. To think of someone viewing them only as a number makes me very sad for the state of affairs for wildlife here in Wisconsin.\par \par \uc2 I encourage everyone that feels the same way to contact their state legislators (I've already called mine, Sen. Tom Tiffany, R-Minocqua) and urge them to support Senate Bill 30, which would ban these contests.\par \par \uc2 Ronald Youngbauer, Boulder Junction\par \par \uc2 National Guard is needed at border\par \par \uc2 I disagree with \uc2 Gov.

Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat who has been particularly vocal about the Trump administration's cruel, if not evil, policy of separating young children from their asylum-seeking parents, was reluctantly allowed to visit an immigrant detention center the other day.\par \par \uc2 After seeing the conditions and how children were kept apart from their parents, he asked U.S. immigration workers if they were concerned about the impact family separation could have on children, some of whom are removed to facilities hundreds of miles away. "We simply follow the orders from above," he was told.\par \par \uc2 When I read that line last week in a Michelle Goldberg column in The \uc2 New York Times\uc2 , I couldn't help but think back to that awful time in history when German soldiers and officials excused their atrocities by explaining they were only following orders.\par \par \uc2 Today, as the rest of us celebrate Father's Day, isn't a good day for hundreds of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  dads, many of whom came here to try to escape murderous gangs and persecution. Their kids are no longer with them and many have no idea where they are.\par \par \uc2 We're reading some of the awful stories now. Goldberg recounted an earlier Times' story that described a 5-year-old boy from Honduras who had been separated from his father and cried himself to sleep at night with a stickfi gure drawing of his family under his pillow.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2  ran a story about a 39-year-old \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Honduras who killed himself in his cell after his 3-year-old was taken.\par \par \uc2 "This is as bad as I've ever seen in 25 years of doing this work," Goldberg quoted the deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants Rights Project. "The little kids are literally being terrorized."\par \par \uc2 Columnist Nicholas Kristof, noting that we as a nation have crossed so many ugly lines lately, says he's haunted by the Trump administration's tactic of seizing children at the border.\par \par \uc2 A Salvadoran woman described how her 4- and 10-year-old sons were taken from her and she was given but five minutes to say goodbye. "Is this really who we are'" Kristof asked. "As a parent, as the son of a refugee myself, I find that in this case Trump's policy has veered from merely abhorrent to truly evil."\par \par \uc2 Yet Trump's secretary of Homeland Security, \uc2 Kirstjen Nielsen\uc2 , defends the policy, saying it's nothing more than what we do every day in the United States when an adult in a family commits a crime.\par \par \uc2 "If you as a parent break into a house, you will be incarcerated by police and thereby separated from your family," she told a congressional committee, attempting to equate situations where children may lose a miscreant parent to jail, but they still can live in their homes, not in some strange land, and, even more importantly, know where everyone is.

To cheering Republican leaders in Salt Lake City, Trump declared "public lands will once again be for public use."\par \par \uc2 Really? I wonder if our president has ever stepped foot in a national park or monument? If he had, he might realize the primary reason we have them is to preserve public lands for public use. These parks and monuments are there for all, and they enrich our lives.\par \par \uc2 As it is, President \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  apparently thinks "public use" involves turning these lands over to private entities - developers (like himself), mining companies, logging companies and others. Of course, this is the very opposite of "public use."\par \par \uc2 It is obviously more important to Trump that he serve the interests of fat cats while spewing platitudes about returning parks and monuments to the "public."\par \par \uc2 What a travesty.\par \par \uc2 John Pray, Verona\par \par \uc2 Immigrant deserved harsher sentence\par \par \uc2 O.J. Simpson never confessed to killing his wife and a young man on that fateful evening in Brentwood, Calif. Most of us thought he was guilty, but his lawyers skillfully maneuvered the trial on racial smears. A jury of easily swayed people were gullible and returned a not guilty verdict. Most of America exclaimed, "What'"\par \par \uc2 An \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , Jose Zarate, confessed he shot \uc2 Kate Steinle\uc2  in San Francisco. He claimed it was an accident. So what? She is still dead.\par \par \uc2 What should have been at least manslaughter is now possession of a stolen gun. Egads! That's like stabbing someone to death and only being charged with possession of a stolen knife.\par \par \uc2 Zarate had been jailed and deported multiple times before he shot Steinle. Because we don't have a secure border, he easily crossed the border and headed for San Francisco, Calif., a sanctuary city that would deal with him leniently. San Francisco came through in spades for Zarate. Not so much for Steinle.\par \par \uc2 I suspect more like Zarate are roaming around illegally in the United States.\par \par \uc2 Joyce McRoberts, New Glarus\par \par \uc2 Deficits don't matter to today's GOP\par \par \uc2 For decades, Republicans have lived by a few core principles: anti-abortion, Second Amendment rights, strong military and small government. Related to small government is the notion that the budget should be balanced. In fact, many Republicans are urging a Constitutional Convention to mandate balanced budgets.\par \par \uc2 So it's surprising Republicans have now become the party of massive deficit spending. Both House and Senate versions of the new tax bill would add more than $1 trillion to the debt. With the exception of \uc2 Sen. Bob Corker\uc2 , R-Tenn., all GOP senators voted for a deficit increase. In the House, Speaker \uc2 Paul Ryan\uc2 , R-Janesville, a noted deficit hawk, led the charge for "tax reform." Have all of the deficit hawks during the Obama admin-istration become chickadees?\par \par \uc2 History has not been kind to debtor nations. Consider the fate of Greece, a country with such massive debt that it is prey to creditor nations. Right now China owns over a trillion dollars of our debt. This will surely rise with this tax bill. As Republicans used to argue, debt is both an economic and a national security issue. I could not agree more.\par \par \uc2 George Savage, Madison\par \par \uc2 Government doesn't own tax money\par \par \uc2 U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Madison, has called the Republican tax cuts a "giveaway to the wealthiest few." U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Black Earth, also has called them a "giveaway to the wealthiest." House Minority Leader \uc2 Nancy Pelosi\uc2 , D-Calif., said the tax rate cuts are a "gift to corporate America."\par \par \uc2 I believe they are each in need of an attitude adjustment.\par \par \uc2 If I choose to not steal your car, it is not a gift to you. You can only give away something you own in the first place. You can argue the cuts are not necessary. You can argue they are unwise. But you can't declare it's all yours to begin with. It is not the government's money. They don't get to decide what you keep.\par \par \uc2 Governments only acquire wealth by confiscating it. Please keep that in mind when you decide how much to confiscate from taxpayers.\par \par \uc2 Patrick O'Loughlin, Madison\par \par \uc2 GOP is dishonest about its principles\par \par \uc2 As saddened as I am by the resignation of U.S. Sen. Al Frankin, D-Minn., I have to respect his decision that realizes how the allegations are taking away from important Senate business.\par \par \uc2 But I have to question the Republican senators and representatives who are still publicly supporting a president who openly brags on tape about molesting women, and a Senate candidate in Alabama who was allegedly banned from a public mall for trolling for young girls. What does this say about those elected officials who are either silent or - even worse - openly voicing support for these men?\par \par \uc2 At least U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Madison, has spoken out to support her convictions, though it may cost her party a vote in the Senate. \uc2 U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson\uc2 , R-Oshkosh, seems to feel his party is more important than his convictions - or else he's not the man he represents himself to be.\par \par \uc2 Patricia M. Giesfeldt, Cottage Grove\par \par \uc2 Don't forget Hill's harassment claims\par \par \uc2 In this time of widespread sexual harassment allegations, we should remember \uc2 Anita Hill\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Twenty-six years ago, long before it was safe, Hill made allegations of sexual harassment against a Supreme Court candidate. Today, these allegations would be considered credible by all but the most partisan observers. At that time, Hill was branded a liar and accused of slanderous claims.\par \par \uc2 As a result, we have a sitting Supreme Court justice today who routinely rules on a wide variety of cases which involve abuses of power and which determine if the rights of women should remain the same as those of men. Maybe it is finally time to do something about this.\par \par \uc2 Jim Miller, Madison\par \par \uc2 Document XWST000020171211edca0002m\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 THE CAP TIMES\par {\*\bkmkstart toc7}{\*\bkmkend toc7}\b \uc2 NEW WOMEN'S LEGAL NETWORK IS A STEP IN RIGHT DIRECTION\b0\par\par\uc2 Margaret Krome \par \uc2 571 \uc2 words\par \uc2 1 November 2017\par \uc2 The Capital Times & Wisconsin State Journal\par \uc2 XWST\par 43\par \uc2 ISSN:07494068\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2017 The Capital Times & Wisconsin State Journal.

Some people are taking productive steps.\par \par \uc2 Months ago, revelations about ways that high-profile and powerful men have coerced women colleagues to provide sexual favors seemed like business as usual. Then the stunning and now months-long Bill Cosby/ Roger Ailes/ Bill O'Reilly/ Harvey Weinstein stories of aggressive abuse began to form an endless torrent of male culprits. And the #MeToo social media campaign that followed demonstrated that sexual coercion is, indeed, business as usual, with a poll finding that 54 percent of American women have experienced "unwanted and inappropriate sexual advances" during their lifetimes. If public exposure and private lawsuits prove insufficiently corrective, we must identify other remedies.\par \par \uc2 During my career, I've mostly set my own salary, but I've been told twice that I shouldn't expect parity with male colleagues because my husband makes a good salary. So I'm not surprised that women earn on average 80 percent what men earn for the same work, and I've witnessed how one's past salary tends to perpetuate inequity. Unfortunately, in April, a federal appeals court ruled that employers can legally pay women less than men for the same work based on previous salary differences. Pushing back recently, California changed its law to prohibit employers from asking about previous salaries and benefits, a step that should open up public discussion about pay inequity.\par \par \uc2 The young immigrant woman whom the Trump administration tried to prevent from receiving an abortion demonstrated both her tenacity in insisting on her legally protected rights and also the power of having legal representation.\par \par \uc2 Unfortunately, current prospects regarding federal protection of women's rights aren't bright. In September, \uc2 CNN\uc2  reported that of the 42 attorneys that President Trump had nominated for U.S. attorneys, only one was a woman. While my own family demonstrates that men can be strong feminists and advocates for women's rights, this appalling record's clear bias augurs ill for meaningful gender protection.\par \par \uc2 So it's exciting that the National Women's Law Center recently launched a national legal network to combat sex discrimination faced by women and girls in jobs, school, and health care. What a travesty that our national leadership should be so unreliable that a private Legal Network for Gender Equity is needed, but it's reassuring to see an actionable strategy to push back - against discriminatory hiring and pay inequality. Against sexual abuse and forcing women to accept health outcomes and reproductive outcomes that aren't of their choosing. Against sexist custom that prevents women the full range of education, self-determination and choice in their lives.\par \par \uc2 Gender discrimination is now evident to all. Certainly, cultural change takes time, but investments in legal remedies right now can help shift that culture toward justice and civility.\par \par \uc2 Credit: By Margaret Krome\par \par \uc2 Document XWST000020171103edb100130\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 LOCAL\par {\*\bkmkstart toc8}{\*\bkmkend toc8}\b \uc2 IMMIGRANT RIGHTS GROUPS CRITICIZE MILWAUKEE\b0\par\par\uc2 379 \uc2 words\par \uc2 5 July 2017\par \uc2 The Capital Times & Wisconsin State Journal\par \uc2 XWST\par \uc2 ISSN:0749405X\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2017 The Capital Times & Wisconsin State Journal.

The Madison Police Department estimated there were 20,000 people on the streets around the Capitol at the peak of the day's march.\par \par \uc2 No arrests or incidents related to the rally were reported by either department.\par \par \uc2 Many protesters were Madison students, some of whom marched in throngs from West and East high schools. Early estimates showed about 4,500 students, or 16 percent of the district's total enrollment, were absent Thursday, compared with 1,500 students and 5.5 percent on a typical day, said district spokeswoman Rachel Strauch-Nelson.\par \par \uc2 The primary goal of the day was to defeat two "antiimmigrant laws" moving through the Legislature, said Christine Neumann-Ortiz, executive director of Voces de la Frontera, the rally's main sponsor.\par \par \uc2 One bill, SB 533, would place restrictions on a local government's ability to issue identification cards to people such as immigrants who are in the country illegally. It has passed the Assembly and the Senate and is awaiting action by Gov. Scott Walker.\par \par \uc2 The other bill, AB 450, would withhold state funding from so- called "sanctuary cities."

Scott Walker has struggled in recent days to say where he stands on immigration, even after Republican rivals usurped him in presidential polls with forceful appeals to voter anger on the issue.\par \par \uc2 Walker appeared to complete a swift, sweeping transformation from immigration pragmatist to hard-liner last week at the Iowa State Fair. There, he endorsed key provisions of the immigration plan put forth by GOP frontrunner \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  hours earlier.\par \par \uc2 But in the face of mounting questions about his immigration position, Walker backpedaled on his support for one of those provisions - ending birthright citizenship - in interviews over the weekend.\par \par \uc2 Trump is leading the GOP pack, in part, on the basis of his sharp opposition to illegal immigration. Experts say that suggests a strident stance by other Republican candidates on the issue would find favor with many GOP caucus-goers and primary voters.\par \par \uc2 But Walker's wobbling on immigration could dog him, especially since he has been accused of flip-flopping on other topics. Should he commit to a hard-line immigration position, experts say it also might dampen his appeal in a general election.\par \par \uc2 Lara Brown, a professor of political management at \uc2 George Washington University\uc2 , said it's clear Trump is driving the GOP conversation on immigration. For now, it may be politically appealing for other Republicans to mimic Trump's positions, but Brown said trouble may await those who do.\par \par \uc2 "Any Republican that chases Trump too far down this rabbit hole will make themselves un-electable next fall," Brown said.\par \par \uc2 At the state fair last week, Walker appeared to express support for building a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico.\par \par \uc2 Birthright citizenship divides GOP field\par \par \uc2 For the first time, Walker also indicated support for ending birthright citizenship - the right to citizenship for those born in the U.S., which is guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution.\par \par \uc2 Both building the wall and ending birthright citizenship are in Trump's immigration plan, which was released a day before Walker's state fair remarks.\par \par \uc2 Both measures also would face practical hurdles to implement. Ending birthright citizenship would be extraordinarily difficult, since it likely would require amending the Constitution, experts say. Building a wall would cost tens of billions of dollars, experts say - and they disagree on how effectively it would deter illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 Walker backtracked on birthright citizenship a few days later, telling CNBC's John Harwood that he neither supports nor opposes ending the practice.\par \par \uc2 As recently as 2013, Walker said he supported creating a path to citizenship for those living in the U.S. illegally. It was a long- held position for Walker, who in 2002, as Milwaukee County executive, signed a resolution expressing support for comprehensive immigration reform.\par \par \uc2 Walker's abrupt evolution on the issue began in March, as he began preparing a presidential run. He said he no longer supports a path to citizenship, telling Fox News host Chris Wallace that his reversal came after he talked to governors of U.S. border states.\par \par \uc2 Walker weighed in again in April, saying he favors lower levels of legal immigration to protect the jobs and wages of workers already in the U.S.\par \par \uc2 Then came his comments in Iowa last week, which followed polls the previous week that showed him tumbling in Iowa and in the national race, while Trump soared.\par \par \uc2 Asked if his repeated calls to secure the border would entail building a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico, Walker said: "It's a combination of infrastructure - the wall itself - but you also have to have technology and personnel in support of that."\par \par \uc2 NBC News on Monday, Aug. 17, asked Walker if he supports ending birthright citizenship.\par \par \uc2 "Yeah, absolutely, going forward," Walker responded.\par \par \uc2 Hunt asked again to confirm Walker's response.\par \par \uc2 "Yeah, to me it's about enforcing the laws in this country," Walker said, nodding.\par \par \uc2 Soon after that, Walker began backtracking. A Tuesday statement to the State Journal from Walker's spokeswoman, AshLee Strong, appeared to distance Walker from his remarks a day earlier.\par \par \uc2 In the interview with Harwood Friday, Walker said he neither supports nor opposes ending birthright citizenship.\par \par \uc2 "I'm saying that until you secure the border and enforce the laws, any discussion about anything else is really looking past the very things we have to do," Walker said.\par \par \uc2 Then Sunday, Walker told ABC's George Stephanopoulos that he doesn't support changing the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which likely would be necessary to end birthright citizenship.\par \par \uc2 Birthright citizenship has emerged as a surprising point of divergence for the Republican presidential field. U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and U.S. Sen. \uc2 Lindsey Graham\uc2  of South Carolina are among those joining the call to end it. Others, such as U.S. Sen. \uc2 Marco Rubio\uc2  and former Gov. Jeb Bush, both of Florida, have said it should remain in place.\par \par \uc2 A few lawmakers, such as former U.S. Sen. \uc2 Jim DeMint\uc2  of South Carolina and Rep. Steve King of Iowa, proposed ending birthright citizenship in years past.\par \par \uc2 Not Walker's first shift on immigration\par \par \uc2 But Marc Rosenblum, an immigration expert at the nonpartisan \uc2 Migration Policy Institute\uc2  in Washington, D.C., said until recently, it "never really had much leverage as a serious proposal."\par \par \uc2 That's because the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees citizenship to anyone born in the U.S. Some conservatives, however, have argued the right doesn't extend to those born to parents living in the U.S. illegally.\par \par \uc2 Amending the Constitution is a monumental task. The only method by which it has been done requires two-thirds approval of the amendment in the U.S. House and Senate, then ratification by three- fourths of the states.\par \par \uc2 Rosenblum said the constitutional amendment hurdle has been the main impediment to a broader discussion of ending birthright citizenship. But now that Trump has proposed it, others are following suit, he said.\par \par \uc2 "It has some sort of intuitive appeal" for opponents of illegal immigration, Rosenblum said. "It really resonates with the idea that immigrants are somehow gaming the system."\par \par \uc2 Arizona law\par \par \uc2 This isn't the first time Walker publicly zigzagged on immigration.\par \par \uc2 As a gubernatorial candidate in 2010, Walker spoke out against Arizona's 2010 immigration law, which, among other provisions, requires state law enforcement officers to check a person's immigration status during routine stops if there is reasonable suspicion that person is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "In America, we don't want our citizens getting pulled over because of how they look," Walker said at the time.\par \par \uc2 Walker changed course days later, saying he would be comfortable signing a similar law in Wisconsin.\par \par \uc2 Walker changed his stance once more in 2012, saying he didn't want the Wisconsin Legislature to pass such a bill because it would become a "huge distraction" from more pressing issues.\par \par \uc2 Immigration also isn't the only major issue on which Walker has shifted this year. He changed his stance on the federal renewable fuel standard - a key issue in the early presidential state of Iowa - and on whether a right-to-work measure would become law in Wisconsin, and was widely perceived as changing his tone on abortion.\par \par \uc2 Brown said virtually every presidential candidate changes their stance on some issue. Where they find trouble, Brown added, is when they shift too far, too fast, or both.\par \par \uc2 "Unsuccessful candidates often make these shifts too quickly," Brown said. "That's how they get branded 'flip-floppers.'"\par \par \uc2 Web Extra\par \par \uc2 Keep up-to-date with the latest news as Scott Walker pursues the 2016 Republican presidential nomination with our Tracking Scott Walker page\par \par \uc2 go.madison.com/walker\par \par \uc2 Caption: BUTCH DILL - Associated Press  Wisconsin Gov.

The GOP-drafted bill (HR 3009) is a response to a recent murder in San Francisco, a sanctuary city, in which an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  with felony convictions allegedly gunned down Kathryn Steinle after city authorities released him from custody.\par \par \uc2 A yes vote was to send the bill to the Senate.\par \par \uc2 Voting yes: Paul Ryan, R-1st, James Sensenbrenner, R-5th, Glenn Grothman, R-6th, \uc2 Sean Duffy\uc2 , R-7th, Reid Ribble, R-8th\par \par \uc2 Voting no: Mark Pocan, D-2nd, Ronald Kind, D-3rd, Gwen Moore, D- 4\par \par \uc2 CRIME RATES IN SANCTUARY CITIES: Voting 181 for and 239 against, the House on Thursday defeated a bid by Democrats to block any funding cuts under HR 3009 (above) that would reduce a city's deployment of police on the beat or raise its crime rate with respect to domestic violence, sex crimes or crimes against children.\par \par \uc2 A yes vote was to adopt the motion, which, had it prevailed, would have immediately amended the bill.\par \par \uc2 Voting yes: Pocan, Kind, Moore\par \par \uc2 Voting no: Ryan, Sensenbrenner, Grothman, Duffy, Ribble\par \par \uc2 STATE REGULATION OF COAL ASH: Voting 258 for and 166 against, the House on Wednesday passed a GOP-drafted bill (HR 1734) that would give states rather than the \uc2 Environmental Protection Agency\uc2  primary authority to regulate the coal ash discharged as waste by the nation's 500-plus coal-fired power plants. The bill would put states in charge of permitting and enforcement under a new \uc2 EPA\uc2  rule for regulating coal ash impounded in ponds or landfills near these plants. The federal rule takes effect Oct. 19.\par \par \uc2 A yes vote was to send the bill to the Senate.\par \par \uc2 Voting yes: Ryan, Moore, Sensenbrenner, Grothman, Duffy, Ribble\par \par \uc2 Voting no: Pocan, Kind\par \par \uc2 DRINKING WATER FROM NEARBY WELLS: Voting 192 for and 231 against, the House on Wednesday refused to require operators of coal-ash impoundment sites to provide notification and alternative sources of safe drinking water to properties within one-half mile whose wells show signs of coal-ash contamination. The Democratic- sponsored amendment was offered to HR 1734 (above).\par \par \uc2 A yes vote was to adopt the amendment.\par \par \uc2 Voting yes: Pocan, Kind, Moore\par \par \uc2 Voting no: Ryan, Sensenbrenner, Grothman, Duffy, Ribble\par \par \uc2 VOLUNTARY LABELING OF GMO FOODS: Voting 275 for and 150 against, the House on Thursday passed a bill (HR 1599) that would establish a system of voluntary, state-administered labeling requirements for foods that contain genetically modified organisms (GMOs). In addition, the bill pre-empts any existing or future state or local laws that establish mandatory labeling of genetically engineered foods. At present, there are no federal requirements for GMO labeling.\par \par \uc2 A yes vote favored a voluntary state-by-state approach to labeling GMO foods.\par \par \uc2 Voting yes: Ryan, Sensenbrenner, Grothman, Duffy, Ribble\par \par \uc2 Voting no: Pocan, Kind, Moore\par \par \uc2 MANDATORY GMO LABELING: Voting 123 for and 303 against, the House on Thursday defeated an amendment to HR 1599 (above) that sought to require mandatory, federally administered labeling of foods containing genetically modified organisms (GMOs). This would replace the underlying bill's voluntary state-level approach.\par \par \uc2 A yes vote was to establish federally mandated labeling of foods containing GMOs.\par \par \uc2 Voting yes: Pocan, Moore\par \par \uc2 Voting no: Ryan, Kind, Sensenbrenner, Grothman, Duffy, Ribble\par \par \uc2 GMO FOODS LABELED AS 'NATURAL': Voting 163 for and 262 against, the House on Thursday refused to prohibit food labeled as "natural" from containing genetically modified ingredients. The vote affirmed wording in HR 1599 (above) that allows \uc2 Food and Drug Administration\uc2  and \uc2 U.S. Department of Agriculture\uc2  definitions of "natural" to include GMO foods.\par \par \uc2 A yes vote was to prohibit foods containing GMOs from being labeled as "natural."\par \par \uc2 Voting yes: Pocan, Kind, Moore\par \par \uc2 Voting no: Ryan, Sensenbrenner, Grothman, Duffy, Ribble\par \par \uc2 SIX-YEAR TRANSPORTATION BILL: Voting 62 for and 36 against, the Senate on Wednesday agreed to start debate on a bill (HR 22) that would authorize $317 billion over six years for highway and mass- transit construction projects. Because the Highway Trust Fund is projected to raise only $240 billion over the next six years to finance these projects, the bill faces a shortfall of $77 billion that would be funded by revenue increases or spending cuts yet to be fully determined. If the bill clears the Senate, it would have to be reconciled with a House-passed measure to fund transportation programs only through Dec. 18.\par \par \uc2 A yes vote was to advance the transportation bill.\par \par \uc2 Voting yes: Ron Johnson, R\par \par \uc2 Voting no: Tammy Baldwin, D\par \par \uc2 Next week, the House will take up bills on federal regulations and veterans' programs, while the Senate will resume work on a six- year funding bill for highway and mass-transit construction projects.\par \par \uc2 Document XWST000020160217eb7p0000u\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 WEEKEND\par {\*\bkmkstart toc12}{\*\bkmkend toc12}\b \uc2 PLATA'S 'ROAD' TELLS TALES OF HIS OWN LIFE'S JOURNEY\b0\par\par\uc2 JANE BURNS  \par \uc2 JANE BURNS jburns@madison.com, 608-252-6440\par \uc2 1,093 \uc2 words\par \uc2 20 March 2015\par \uc2 The Capital Times & Wisconsin State Journal\par \uc2 XWST\par \uc2 ALL\par D1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2015 The Capital Times & Wisconsin State Journal.

All Rights Reserved.  \par \par \uc2 There can be various ways to tell a life story, and Cris Plata knows that firsthand.\par \par \uc2 The Wisconsin singer-songwriter already has his story in book form, and now that book has a companion. "Migration Road," Plata's third release and first since 2003, takes its cues from the music he heard in his youth as his family traveled the U.S. as migrant farm workers.\par \par \uc2 "So I had to go back and think of the first music that I'd heard in these places, music I'd never been exposed to in Texas," said Plata, 60, who was born on a ranch near Poteet, Texas.\par \par \uc2 The CD serves as a companion piece to "Cris Plata: From Fields to Stage," a youth-targeted book in the Wisconsin Historical Press' Badger Biography Series. The book came out last year, and the CD is being released this week with a launch party Saturday at the High Noon Saloon.\par \par \uc2 "I think this is the best CD I've done, in terms of the material and the fidelity, and to have my wife at the helm producing it was a unique experience," Plata said.\par \par \uc2 His wife, Ann, a veterinarian, also plays bass in the band. It was her first time as producer and she also wrote the CD's opening song, "Goodbye Butterfly." Many of the songs benefited from his wife's tweaks, Plata said, in terms of instrumentation, content and tempo.\par \par \uc2 "I learned from Butch Vig because he had great ideas," Plata said of the Smart Studio producer who worked on Plata's first record, 1989's "Spreading the Rumor." "But Ann must have really been paying attention."\par \par \uc2 The suggestion to make it a collection of the sounds that influenced him came from Ann, Plata said, and the result is a variety of styles as he retraces the road that brought him to Wisconsin. It's where he remains, living with Ann on a farm near Columbus.\par \par \uc2 Plata's family worked the cotton fields of Texas, tomato fields of Indiana and Florida and a variety of vegetable operations in Wisconsin. Music was their entertainment, both back home in Texas and while in their temporary homes far away.\par \par \uc2 Plata learned the guitar at a young age, picking up the music that he heard around him as a child, what he describes as Mexican roots music.\par \par \uc2 But his travels opened his ears to different kinds of music, styles he'd never heard before. That's part of the music that makes up "Migration Road," and the stories those songs tell.\par \par \uc2 The record's second track, "House of the Master," is about the workers in Florida who had to go to the fields on Sunday, without pay, because the boss said so and the workers had to keep their jobs. Migrant workers came to Florida from Jamaica, too, and Plata was introduced to their music.\par \par \uc2 "They were singing stuff I'd never heard before," Plata said. "I wasn't a musician then but I loved music and thought, 'I really like what they're doing.'"\par \par \uc2 He asked them what it was, and they told him it was "rocksteady" - a precursor to reggae music.\par \par \uc2 The next track on the record, "Sitting in the Shade," takes its inspiration from another music that was unfamiliar to the young Plata - bluegrass. He first heard it when his family was in Indiana and again was intrigued.\par \par \uc2 "We'd turn on the radio and think, 'What's this strange sound"" Plata said. "It was banjos and high and lonesome singing, mandolins, guitars and a big doghouse bass. I really liked it."\par \par \uc2 The record also includes much of what has inspired Plata throughout his life - a love of animals and all of nature, as well as a sense of trying to do right in the world.\par \par \uc2 That comes through in one of the most beautiful songs on the record, "Moonlight Walkabout," inspired by the times that Plata would just sit in the fields on a moon-lit night, listen to the sounds of the animals and play his guitar.\par \par \uc2 His heritage comes through strong in a song that is a tribute to his oldest brother, Juan, who taught him traditional music and also gave him his introduction to rock 'n' roll.\par \par \uc2 "A couple years before he died, I went down to Texas and he introduced me to all his musical friends who were in a mariachi band, and that was a treat," Plata said.\par \par \uc2 "I learned quite a bit because I'd never played with a full mariachi band before."\par \par \uc2 Plata wanted to do a mariachi song, but he wanted to do it right and it was still unfamiliar territory to him. He used a combination of English and Spanish lyrics, and brought in Chris Wagoner of the Stellanovas on violin.\par \par \uc2 "I had to sweat it out. I wanted to do a tribute, but I wanted to do it justice," Plata said. "I didn't want it to be a hack job.\par \par \uc2 "I kind of had to study it a little bit."\par \par \uc2 His "Migration Road" ends with the first song he ever recorded in 1989. He was about to record his first album in Madison, but while visiting family in San Antonio was inspired to write the song "Little Eagle" after reading about the death of an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  in a locked truck.\par \par \uc2 Plata wanted the song to have the traditional sound of border music, and recorded it there to achieve that.\par \par \uc2 "My wife said, "Why don't you put on the first song that you ever recorded? Then it's like completing the journey," he said in choosing songs for "Migration Road."\par \par \uc2 The migration days are long over for Plata. He'll spend time playing around the Midwest again this year, but also taking time to ride horses with his wife.\par \par \uc2 It's a passion they both share, with a horse on the CD's cover and two songs evoking horses.\par \par \uc2 "She did so much for this record," Plata said. "We're going to spend some time doing what she wants to do."\par \par \uc2 IF YOU GO\par \par \uc2 What: Cris Plata with Extra Hot\par \par \uc2 When: 5:30 p.m. Saturday\par \par \uc2 Where: High Noon Saloon, 701A E.

Fortunately, no one was seriously hurt.\par \par \uc2 Since texting probably impairs driving as much as drinking does, the punishment should be the same. Whenever we see people texting behind the wheel, we should call the police and report them. The police can't be everywhere, but the public can.\par \par \uc2 If people want to kill themselves, that's one thing. But I don't want them to take me with them.\par \par \uc2 - Richard Nawratil, Monona\par \par \uc2 Hamas\uc2  exposes its civilians to risk\par \par \uc2 Though \uc2 Hamas\uc2  is the acknowledged terrorist aggressor to Israel, it is also the first to cry "cease-fire." Why? Because Israel fights smarter.\par \par \uc2 Israel has an "Iron Dome" - an anti-ballistic missile system - to intercept incoming \uc2 Hamas\uc2  missiles. It's an effective system for the most part, but Israel also has a backup bomb shelter system. Israel has spent much money on protection for its citizens.\par \par \uc2 On the other hand, \uc2 Hamas\uc2  spends its money on missiles, armaments and cement-reinforced tunnels used to attack Israel. Schools and hospitals are used as launching pads for missiles into Israel.\par \par \uc2 When Israel's missiles hit \uc2 Hamas\uc2  missile "launching pads," civilians are killed and Israel becomes the evil aggressor. That's because the international media, the jihadist Muslim world and the United Nations slant it that way.\par \par \uc2 - Joyce McRoberts, New Glarus\par \par \uc2 Consumers penalized for conservation\par \par \uc2 When I read "Solar growth stings utilities" in the July 27 State Journal, I did a double take.\par \par \uc2 I wrote a letter to the editor in 2010 when green customers were using less water and the utility was feeling a shortfall. They asked for a current and future rate increase. My letter stated: "How can the people win? ... By conserving water, they pay more, and if they don't conserve water, they pay more."\par \par \uc2 Now the same thing is happening with other utilities. The green movement has successfully promoted solar energy. The utilities say they are beginning to feel the pinch and want to raise their rates now and again in the future.\par \par \uc2 The utilities are businesses doing their best to head off competition, even if it is "good" competition that they fostered.\par \par \uc2 It is our responsibility - including the Regulatory Assistance Project, the \uc2 Citizens Utility Board\uc2  and private citizens - to head these rate increases off at the pass, something we weren't able to do with the water utility.\par \par \uc2 - Joyce I. Nigbor, Madison\par \par \uc2 Technical college education too limited\par \par \uc2 A referendum on the primary election ballot calls for $4 million in additional property taxes for Blackhawk Technical College.\par \par \uc2 Most states used to have both a tech college system and a community or junior college system that merged to eliminate duplication of buildings, campuses, programs and services. I have long advocated the merger of the \uc2 Wisconsin Technical College System\uc2  and the \uc2 University of Wisconsin\uc2  System to create a Wisconsin State College System.\par \par \uc2 Some fear the loss of the "technology and industry" programs of tech colleges. But this can be addressed with a requirement that up to 40 percent of the budget goes to trade and industry programs.\par \par \uc2 Another concern I have is the lack of basic education requirements for tech college students that other colleges have, including course work in social studies, science and humanities.\par \par \uc2 The problem with tech colleges is that business and industry want to create worker drones rather than well-rounded, educated citizens.\par \par \uc2 - Dave Searles, Brodhead\par \par \uc2 US can't solve every problem, care for all\par \par \uc2 A letter last Thursday from the executive director of the Wisconsin Alliance for Women's Health claimed pro-lifers are hypocritical and hateful toward \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  children.\par \par \uc2 Pro-lifers (not necessarily political parties) care about all life, young and old, male and female, from conception to natural death.\par \par \uc2 Treating symptoms alone never eliminates causes. Too many people have forgotten or rejected our creator's perfect plan. Our country can't solve the causes of violence in other countries, nor support all its effects.\par \par \uc2 Legalized abortion in 1973 didn't eliminate the causes of immature or irresponsible sexual actions. Since then millions of such resultant lives have been conceived and then eliminated.\par \par \uc2 Compassion begins at home, and pro-lifers do their part to save as many of the least of these unwanted lives as they can. Adoption offers refuge from violence in the womb.\par \par \uc2 - Alice Mueller, Richland Center\par \par \uc2 Subeck stands for fairness in workplace\par \par \uc2 I support Lisa Subeck for Assembly because of her positions on raising the minimum wage, providing paid sick leave and equal pay.\par \par \uc2 These are issues that cut across partisan political lines. We need policies that recognize the reality of peoples' lives today and also support an economy that works for everyone.\par \par \uc2 Women are increasingly the breadwinners in their families. When employers don't pay people equally for doing the same job, or when there is no access to paid sick leave, it hurts children, families and our economy.\par \par \uc2 Subeck has shown, by her career and her stands on issues, that she understands the importance of making the workplace fair and how that helps us all.

Those left behind depend on their financial support. Parents may become separated from their children.\par \par \uc2 Deporting drug dealers back to their countries has caused an escalation of violence and death in those countries. Many children come to the United States because their only surviving parent is here, or because they are orphaned and homeless.\par \par \uc2 Our immigration policies and international trade agreements helped create the problems we now have.

An average of around one million legal immigrants have entered the United States annually since 1990. If \uc2 the Senate\uc2  amnesty bill passed last June becomes law, it would mean even more.\par \par \uc2 To be sure, the thousands of Central American children entering this country illegally is heart-breaking, but this crisis exists because of the federal government's decades-long message that we are not serious about enforcing immigration laws.\par \par \uc2 And the biggest losers are the 18 million jobless Americans who want full-time work but can't find it. Why isn't their struggle to compete with immigrants in a dismal job market also viewed as a "humanitarian crisis"?\par \par \uc2 The editorial correctly states "our capacity for newcomers is limited." According to the \uc2 Pew Research Center\uc2 , immigration currently is responsible for 82 percent of our population growth and at this rate, our numbers are projected to reach 438 million by 2050.\par \par \uc2 At what number do we finally heed Earth Day founder Gaylord Nelson's warning that we "can't take all the people who want to come here"?\par \par \uc2 - Dave Gorak, LaValle, executive director, Midwest Coalition to Reduce Immigration\par \par \uc2 U.S. not serious about controlling immigration\par \par \uc2 The current mass immigration of children to the United States is being used as a tool to sell big increases in legal immigration. Never mind that the "trickle" of legal immigrants into the U.S. has averaged a million per year for the last quarter-century.\par \par \uc2 Some think we must have many more immigrants to assure America's economic success a perpetual motion machine.\par \par \uc2 There is no serious fence along most of the border, no requirement that employers electronically verify the Social Security numbers of employees. Deportation beyond the border area is focused on criminals.\par \par \uc2 Without changing these incentives, you can set any higher level of legal immigration and still have high illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 As John Kass wrote in his column last Sunday, "Democrats are encouraging waves of unskilled labor from south of the border to compete for what few lowskilled jobs still exist." The bulk of our leadership is doing likewise.\par \par \uc2 - Chuck Litweiler, Madison\par \par \uc2 Allow more guest workers to come to America\par \par \uc2 Dairy farmers in Wisconsin are in desperate need of employees, and immigrants seem to be the best choice to fill the need.\par \par \uc2 The federal government provides a small number of guest worker certificates, far below the number actually needed.\par \par \uc2 Why can't that number be raised to truly meet the need? Latino workers would not have to die in the desert to find work. While living in Wisconsin, they would not have to bring family here but could return home several times a year to visit. Farmers would not have to hire undocumented workers.\par \par \uc2 Why does it need to be so hard to solve this puzzle?\par \par \uc2 - Marlene Hardick, Madison\par \par \uc2 Immigration policies do more harm than good\par \par \uc2 The sad immigration story just keeps getting sadder.\par \par \uc2 As a North American I am ashamed that we are treating people the same way as we would treat a rodent problem. Fellow humans are coming here because they are desperate and cannot survive in their own country, not because they expect a warm welcome and all their needs met here.\par \par \uc2 For our country's future, and for that of the world, children need their parents, safety, access to food, health care and education. These people are courageous beyond belief to make the trip, and to be arrested and deliberately "displaced" is cruel.\par \par \uc2 A recent letter-writer mentioned the potential of the children who have come. I would add the example given in a recent article of a 30-year-old who had been here since age 7, who had a good job and a wife and two daughters here when he was deported in 2010.\par \par \uc2 More harm than good will come from "displacing" people. We are separating families, removing children from the parental love and support they need, removing adults with no criminal past who are contributing members of our communities.\par \par \uc2 It's cruel, makes no sense, is a waste of time and resources and will hurt us in the long run.\par \par \uc2 - Jan Tymorek, Madison\par \par \uc2 Obama is willing to give our country away\par \par \uc2 Our country has a commander in chief devoid of leadership ability, which runs through his whole administration. The flow of illegal immigrants is to his advantage, just to stick it to his political opponents. Polls prove his feeling for this country is very shallow.\par \par \uc2 The people coming across the border, whether young children or adults, are illegal immigrants and should be shipped back.\par \par \uc2 Many of our men and women have served and many have made the ultimate sacrifice to protect the sovereignty and the borders of other countries, but President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  does not see fit to protect our borders. Why?\par \par \uc2 The question for liberal Democrats is when you give our country away, what else are you willing to give?\par \par \uc2 - Robert E. Schultz, Darlington\par \par \uc2 Today's protesters forget their immigrant ancestors\par \par \uc2 America has always had hard work to do. Except for the Indians, we are all late comers.\par \par \uc2 Immigrants have always come to this country with hope in their hearts, looking for something better. They got the worst jobs, worked hard, endured prejudice, and saved their earnings. They made sure their kids worked hard in school and had manners and respect for teachers and others.\par \par \uc2 When immigrants came here, they were greeted with prejudice and disdain.\par \par \uc2 It's no different today except the time and fashion. We have protesters dressed up in red, white and blue carrying signs, and shouting hateful phrases.\par \par \uc2 These individuals think nothing about how their ancestors felt when they came to America.\par \par \uc2 As a mob, protesters shout hate at little children and young mothers who are escaping countries ruined by our drug addiction. These broken, desperate families are drug lord refugees.\par \par \uc2 These protesters are part of a misogynistic political party, which stands directly against our American president and the thoughtful Americans who care for people, no matter what their race, sex or age.\par \par \uc2 - Daniel Holzman, Baraboo\par \par \uc2 Address the needs of children in U.S. first\par \par \uc2 This is a humanitarian crisis. All of the children in the United States who go to bed hungry every night is also a humanitarian crisis.\par \par \uc2 We can help these children from other countries who have crossed the border only when all of the children in this country are fed, clothed and have a place to sleep at night.\par \par \uc2 Let us address the needs of our children first, and the needs of others requiring our assistance second.\par \par \uc2 - Joyce Fichtel, Hillpoint\par \par \uc2 United States often the cause of refugee problems\par \par \uc2 The United States has a long history of creating refugee problems in other countries.\par \par \uc2 The Bay of Pigs betrayal has left us with a steady stream of Cubans since the 1960s. The Vietnamese and Hmong who survived after our partial evacuation still trickle in.\par \par \uc2 Our illegal invasion of Iraq caused refugee problems for all the surrounding countries while we methodically destroyed their infrastructure.\par \par \uc2 Now we are complaining about the Central American families who are trying to escape the death and destruction of warring drug gangs, which are fighting each other to service the United States' insatiable desire for illegal drugs.\par \par \uc2 We should not only welcome these people with open arms, but we should beg their forgiveness as they walk by.\par \par \uc2 - Rex Tilley, Brooklyn\par \par \uc2 Would Vatican help with immigrant children problem?\par \par \uc2 I saw on the Internet that the pope has weighed in on our flood of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  minors. He has suggested compassion and support. Frankly, I'm gratified, and I think this is a good idea for two reasons.\par \par \uc2 First, I've heard that a proper facility to house the minors would require 90,000 square feet of space. Those dimensions could easily be found inside the Vatican, a great place to protect the children.\par \par \uc2 And certainly the \uc2 Vatican Bank\uc2  has the necessary financial resources to provide years of medical care for a host of Third World infirmities, funded educations and cradle-to-grave housing.\par \par \uc2 It's very important work and it should be an answer to his prayers that we allow him to help.\par \par \uc2 Second, and perhaps most importantly, the Vatican's "put your money where your mouth is" support would be a clear message to the rest of the world. It's easy for a foreign sovereign to carp about what's wrong with America. It's time they put up or shut up.\par \par \uc2 - Chico Buller, Sun Prairie\par \par \uc2 Veterans denied care while invaders' receive it\par \par \uc2 Every year we send millions in aid to the South American countries, this along with thousands of good American jobs.\par \par \uc2 But apparently these governments are doing little to help stop the flow of illegal immigrants coming through their borders to invade the United States. This is especially true with the Mexican government. Of course they don't want to stop them. Then it would become their problem to resettle them.\par \par \uc2 What if we stop all aid to these countries until they step up and help with the problem. At least then the aid money could be used to help with our costs.\par \par \uc2 We are spending money feeding, housing and clothing these invaders. This, while we already have thousands of legal American citizens, including many veterans, who are walking the streets, homeless, hungry and without jobs.\par \par \uc2 I don't care what the reason is, it's not fair when legal citizens who have paid taxes for many years and fought for their country are denied the basics of life while we take care of invaders. We need to close the border with federal troops.\par \par \uc2 - George E. Sutton, Cottage Grove\par \par \uc2 Misinformation leads people to send children here\par \par \uc2 Throughout history, floods of refugees into neighboring countries have posed a threat to the stability of those countries.\par \par \uc2 Erroneous information has apparently been spread throughout Central America that children coming to America would be allowed to stay. This mass assault on our border presents both an economic and a political threat.\par \par \uc2 Our nation's budget will be strained as we struggle to house and feed them as they go through our justice system. No matter how our government handles the situation, it will be targeted by political opponents for failing to protect our nation and its people.\par \par \uc2 Foreign anti-American forces could be at fault for this misinformation. But there are also home-grown forces, who see themselves, but not President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 , as "true Americans." Could they be the source of this misinformation?\par \par \uc2 These immigration problems make the Obama administration an easy target for those determined to blame our president for anything that happens in the world and at home.\par \par \uc2 - Karen Wagner, Wautoma\par \par \uc2 Secure our borders and enforce existing laws\par \par \uc2 We do not need a "sweeping change" in our immigration laws. And I don't think it is wise to increase the number of legal immigrants allowed into the United States.\par \par \uc2 We are hard pressed to employ our own people now. Why do we need more?\par \par \uc2 The only change we need is to properly enforce our existing laws and to secure our borders.\par \par \uc2 - Gary W. Sutherland, Brodhead\par \par \uc2 How many illeal immigrants will come to Wisconsin?\par \par \uc2 The Christian Science Monitor, in a July 2006 issue, had an article about "Operation Wetback." It indicated that in 1954, President Dwight Eisenhower, over the course of two years, deported around 1.3 million illegal immigrants from Mexico to help provide jobs for Americans.\par \par \uc2 In 1986, President Ronald Reagan was set to deport illegal immigrants when the Democrats persuaded him to declare amnesty. In return they promised the border would be secured. Their promise to secure the border was never kept.\par \par \uc2 Now, in 2014, it's strange that President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  doesn't think American workers need help. He is more interested in hiding the illegal immigrants by transporting them, some of whom may carry disease, all over our nation.\par \par \uc2 Madison Mayor Paul Soglin said last week that Wisconsin was to get some illegal immigrants here. The fact that the federal government is handling this so secretively makes you figure they are up to something. This will affect Madison's medical services, education and housing.\par \par \uc2 Why won't our government provide complete information?\par \par \uc2 - Joyce McRoberts, New Glarus\par \par \uc2 Caption: MATT YORK Associated Press Protesters gather near the entrance to an Oracle, Ariz., juvenile facility Tuesday in an effort to stop a bus load of Central American immigrant children from being delivered to the facility.  \par \par \uc2 Document XWST000020140730ea7k0005y\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 SUNDAY OPINION\par {\*\bkmkstart toc16}{\*\bkmkend toc16}\b \uc2 MORE VIEWS\b0\par\par\uc2 1,693 \uc2 words\par \uc2 29 June 2014\par \uc2 The Capital Times & Wisconsin State Journal\par \uc2 XWST\par \uc2 ALL\par E2\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2014 The Capital Times & Wisconsin State Journal.

Dave Gorak, La Valle, Midwest Coalition to Reduce Immigration\par \par \uc2 Make State Street vehicle-free to support cafes\par \par \uc2 A Wednesday front-page article, "City considers ordinance to shrink sidewalk cafes," discussed a way to give State Street pedestrians more walking room. Wow, what a regressive approach to this problem!\par \par \uc2 Why not consider what many European cities have done: take a signature street and turn it into a pedestrian- and bicycleonly thoroughfare.\par \par \uc2 I have experienced these areas and they are delightful, serving as a mecca to draw people into a friendly shopping and eating zone. Why not have something like this for Madison's signature street?\par \par \uc2 There is no reason to have buses going up and down this six- block stretch. The restaurants could expand their outdoor seating areas, there would be plenty of room for pedestrians and bikes, and this could become an amazing place to visit in Madison.\par \par \uc2 It sure would be better than having smaller restaurant seating areas with diesel-belching buses ruining the atmosphere.\par \par \uc2 Progressive Madison should try to be progressive in responding to this issue.\par \par \uc2 ? Joseph Tripalin, McFarland\par \par \uc2 Common-sense gun laws are sorely needed\par \par \uc2 Grown men showing off their guns at parks, stores and coffee shops in Wisconsin is dangerous and ludicrous.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 National Rifle Association\uc2  and its advocates want everyone to carry guns everywhere and use them to protect against criminals. This lacks common sense. How can we distinguish a law-abiding citizen from a citizen who's not in two seconds?\par \par \uc2 We've fallen down the slippery slope, pushed by those who love their guns so much they can't be reasonable or admit that others may not wish to carry guns. This could be simply for moral purposes ("Thou shalt not kill") or because they want to live in a civilized society where problems are not solved by shooting first and asking later.\par \par \uc2 We have rights as well, to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Living in fear is not happiness. Trampling on others' rights does not constitute freedom.\par \par \uc2 Our legislators should stop listening to gun lobbyists and enact common-sense laws. Laws restricting the use of guns won't prevent all tragedies, but they will help establish acceptable behavior and influence the culture in our communities.\par \par \uc2 ? Brenda Thomas, Madison\par \par \uc2 Religion in government fraught with danger\par \par \uc2 In Iraq, the Sunnis and Shiites are killing each other again.\par \par \uc2 They were born in the same country and speak the same language. Both are believers in Islam, but differ in interpretations of their Koran.\par \par \uc2 The Sunnis say they are being mistreated by the Shiites, who are now in positions of power in the government, while the Shiites seem to be getting even for the many years they were mistreated while the Sunnis were in power.\par \par \uc2 It's crazy ? almost as if Catholics and Protestants were killing each other over some details in the Bible.\par \par \uc2 Wait a minute! I almost forgot Catholics and Protestants actually were killing each other for many years, in Europe, except when they weren't busy killing Jews.\par \par \uc2 Would somebody remind me, again, why it would be a good thing if we had more religion in government?\par \par \uc2 ? Art Naebig, La Valle\par \par \uc2 What would Jesus do about O'Connor Center?\par \par \uc2 In \uc2 Chris Rickert\uc2 's June 17 column, "Church exemption burdens taxpayers," he writes about the \uc2 Catholic Diocese\uc2  of Madison manipulating plans for the future of the Bishop O'Connor Center with the purpose of avoiding payment of property taxes.\par \par \uc2 It appears apartments planned for the building would be in competition with other businesses that pay property taxes. However, the church is calling them "benevolent apartments' because there will be amenities associated with them aimed at seniors looking for a religious living environment.\par \par \uc2 The Catholic Church uses its interpretation of Scripture to support its signature opposition to artificial birth control, abortion and gay marriage.\par \par \uc2 Apparently the church is unfamiliar with the Bible passages in Matthew 22:21, and Mark 12: 17, in which Jesus says "Therefore render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's."\par \par \uc2 In other words, Jesus said "Pay your taxes."\par \par \uc2 ? Philip M. Neis, Madison\par \par \uc2 We all deserve good government\par \par \uc2 The author of a recent letter titled "Use your vote wisely this fall" quotes the well-known epigram of philosopher Joseph de Maistre: "People get the government they deserve."\par \par \uc2 Actually, de Maistre was wrong about that. Germans did not deserve Hitler, Russians did not deserve Stalin, and China did not deserve Mao Zedong. Add your own to the list.\par \par \uc2 Everyone deserves good government, and they deserve to have the knowledge of how to peacefully rid themselves of bad government.\par \par \uc2 De Maistre had the bad luck to have his philosophy summarized for posterity by the most foolish thing he said.\par \par \uc2 ? John Morgan, Madison\par \par \uc2 Consider elk herd when setting wolf hunt quota\par \par \uc2 Regarding last Sunday's guest column by Ron Weber, "Bears vs. wolves in northern Wisconsin," I also hope the decision regarding the wolf hunting quota is based on science.\par \par \uc2 If it is, the quota will be doubled for the wolf hunt. The stated plan is to reduce the population to 350 wolves statewide, yet the quota is always set too low.\par \par \uc2 What about the Wisconsin elk herd, which is not increasing as it should be due to the increased predation from wolves?\par \par \uc2 Elk were also native animals wiped out many years ago, but the pro-wolf people care little about the progress of the elk herd.\par \par \uc2 There is room for both, but the wolf population must be reduced in number for the elk to make it and increase.\par \par \uc2 ? Gary W. Sutherland, Brodhead\par \par \uc2 Redskins\uc2  name is not respectful\par \par \uc2 I don't buy the argument that the \uc2 Redskins\uc2  name is a sign of respect.\par \par \uc2 A recent letter writer used the example of Vikings noting that they are often portrayed as "mean, grumpy and bloodthirsty men." Most people I know don't like, let alone respect, mean, grumpy and blood-thirsty men. Instead, we fear them, because they are intimidating and unpredictable.\par \par \uc2 That is the reason some schools choose powerful and destructive forces of nature, such as cyclones, avalanches, blizzards and lightning as their mascots. We don't revere and admire hurricanes and tornadoes. We are simply afraid of their power. Some schools even use devils and demons as their mascots. They don't choose those nicknames out of respect for Satan.\par \par \uc2 Finally, identifying a group of people by the color of their skin is not a show of respect. We no longer refer to Asians as yellow- skinned or Hispanics as brown-skinned for the same reasons we no longer refer to Native Americans as \uc2 Redskins\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ? Dave Edgerton, Madison\par \par \uc2 Marriage makes parents responsible for children\par \par \uc2 In a Thursday letter, "Marriage and parenthood are distinct issues," the writer reminds us that people made babies for millennia before we had marriage.\par \par \uc2 However, as civilization advanced, we found that societies functioned much better when the mother and father were clearly identified as responsible for their children.\par \par \uc2 That was formalized as the institution of marriage. In fact, were it not for the prospect of natural children, we would not have the institution of marriage.\par \par \uc2 Obviously, gay couples cannot have natural children.\par \par \uc2 But I must admit that the biggest problem with marriage in our culture is not gay marriage but rather the flood of non-marital births.\par \par \uc2 These children seldom have a committed father, and the results are bad.\par \par \uc2 Data suggests they are more likely to not finish high school, to use drugs, to commit crimes, and to live in poverty.\par \par \uc2 This is because our society does not recognize that the purpose of marriage is to provide a stable, protecting home for children, not just to express love between the couple.\par \par \uc2 ? Wayne Shockley, Brooklyn\par \par \uc2 Marriage is more than a legal contract\par \par \uc2 Reducing marriage to only a legal contract as presented in Thursday's letter, "Marriage and parenthood are distinct issues," is necessary for the legitimization of same-sex marriage.\par \par \uc2 However, marriage is much more than a legal contract. It involves a deep personal unity that includes the union of one flesh; requiring indissolubility and faithfulness in mutual self-giving and is open to fertility.\par \par \uc2 Civil society requires a legal dimension to marriage due to its concern for permanent unions of mothers and fathers.\par \par \uc2 The common good is best served when children are raised by their biological parents together in one home.\par \par \uc2 Reductionism of the sacredness of marriage is all the rage at this time. What the consequences will be remains to be seen.\par \par \uc2 ? Monsignor Roger J. Scheckel, Richland Center\par \par \uc2 Procreation only possible with a male and female\par \par \uc2 A letter in Thursday's paper, "Marriage and parenthood are distinct issues," referenced a previous letter to the editor, "Existence is due to the mother and father."\par \par \uc2 The writer of Thursday's letter totally missed the point.\par \par \uc2 The facts of biology and procreation are very basic. In order to procreate it takes a male and a female. Males cannot procreate with males, and females cannot procreate with females.\par \par \uc2 The same-sex couples today who are demanding equal this and equal that are here in this world because of a male and a female, a sperm and an egg.\par \par \uc2 If the entire world were made up of only same-sex couples, and no surgical intervention existed to facilitate procreation, the human race would become extinct.\par \par \uc2 That is a biological fact. It has nothing to do with marriage or a marriage contract.\par \par \uc2 ?

Her brother is a senior systems programmer at UW- Madison.\par \par \uc2 As for the update on Enrique, he was partying with friends at a motel in 2011 when police officers arrived, Nazario said. He had an outstanding arrest warrant for not paying a ticket for driving without a license, she said.\par \par \uc2 He was arrested and handed over to federal immigration authorities to be deported. "He spent the next 14 months locked up for that," she said.\par \par \uc2 During this time, Enrique was separated from his girlfriend and their two children.

Alfaro-Gomez, 25, pleaded no contest in April to charges of homicide by negligent driving and causing great bodily harm by reckless driving that resulted in the crash on Highway 12 and Highway K that killed Richard D. Lemoine, 65, and seriously injured his wife, Linda.\par \par \uc2 But Alfaro-Gomez was ruled to not be responsible for the crash because he was afflicted with psychosis at the time.\par \par \uc2 Originally, \uc2 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2  had a hold on Alfaro-Gomez and his lawyer, Assistant Public Defender Luis Cuevas, anticipated that deportation proceedings would begin as soon as Alfaro-Gomez was released.\par \par \uc2 ICE, however, later dropped its hold, leaving open the possibility for Alfaro-Gomez to remain in the U.S. He then requested that he return to Honduras.\par \par \uc2 Dane County Circuit Judge William Hanrahan approved a plan in which Alfaro-Gomez will be monitored by the state Department of Health Services until the paperwork can be completed for him to return to Honduras. He'll live with relatives in the area until then.\par \par \uc2 "He's a fish out of water here," said Cuevas. "Mentally, it's more beneficial to him to go back to his home country. He will have the support of his mother and family members. He wants to go back. We discussed that and that's what he wants."\par \par \uc2 Cuevas said it could take several months to work out the details of that return.\par \par \uc2 "Given what happened here I think it's important that he's supervised," Cuevas said. "He has no objection. He certainly feels bad as to what happened. It's regrettable. He understands that he'll be protected and the public will be protected."\par \par \uc2 The Lemoines' son, Josh Lemoine, said he was disappointed that immigration officials released their hold on Alfaro-Gomez after the plea agreement.\par \par \uc2 "It's pretty clear that his mental health is unstable and he's a risk to public safety being here," Josh Lemoine said. "He's an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , and it's just disappointing that ICE doesn't step up to the plate and do their part in the case."\par \par \uc2 Linda Lemoine was suffering from colon cancer at the time of the accident and was to have started chemotherapy. But that was delayed because of the injuries she suffered in the crash, which caused her to be hospitalized for more than three weeks.

"Illegal" from now on should be used only to describe actions, not people, say AP executives.\par \par \uc2 Major newspapers, including the New York Times and the Los Angeles Times, also are considering changing their style sheets to drop the term. Not only is it offensive to many, critics say, it is an oxymoron because someone who is an "immigrant" is by definition someone who has legal status to live permanently in the United States.\par \par \uc2 A change in newspaper style usually goes unnoticed by anyone outside a newsroom, but this one has people weighing in on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and other online discussions. Fox News and other conservative news outlets have characterized the move as "cheerleading" in advance of expected immigration reform in Congress.\par \par \uc2 A campaign to Drop the I-Word, launched by the online news source Color-Lines, has been under way for a couple of years. But momentum is building as Democrats ? and most Republicans smarting from immigrant communities' firm embrace of President Obama in 2012 ? agree that this is the year to pass comprehensive immigration reform. The White House is pressing for fast action, including a vote in the Senate as early as this month.\par \par \uc2 What people are called is more than a matter of semantics, says Salvador Carranza, president of the Latino Education Council of Dane County. "It affects how the general public perceives people who are here to make a better life and contribute their best to the country," he told me. "It's very important."\par \par \uc2 People who stay in the country after a visa expires may have violated the civil regulations governing immigration, Carranza told me. Those who re-enter the United States after being deported may be guilty of a misdemeanor, he admitted, but many are trying to return to support their families. "How is that a crime?" he asked.\par \par \uc2 "No person is ?illegal.' It has always been offensive to many people, especially immigrants," Carranza argued.\par \par \uc2 Carranza, long active in the grass-roots Latinos United for Education and Advancement, said the group worked for years to get local newspapers and TV stations to drop the I-word. He even stopped returning calls for comment from Wisconsin State Journal reporters a couple of years ago when the paper decided to stick to AP style.\par \par \uc2 State Journal City Editor Phil Brinkman told me that the newspaper will continue to adhere to AP style as much as possible. In a newsroom memo, Brinkman said he characterized AP's move away from "\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 " as a positive change overall.\par \par \uc2 "I've long had a problem with the ?nounification' of groups of people. I have always advised reporters to wherever possible not put labels on groups of people, but describe the situation," he said.\par \par \uc2 "Illegal immigration" is a term that will continue to be used in the paper, because without labeling anyone it conveys that people who stay in the country on an expired visa or sneak in without one are "willfully violating U.S. immigration law," Brinkman told me.\par \par \uc2 At The Capital Times, Managing Editor Chris Murphy said we have not had a formal policy on the use of "\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 " but informally have avoided it in recent years and will continue to do so.\par \par \uc2 Caption: ISTOCK People march in downtown Los Angeles in 2010 to demand immigration reform.   \par \par \uc2 Document XWST000020130411e94a00015\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 OPINION\par {\*\bkmkstart toc20}{\*\bkmkend toc20}\b \uc2 YOUR VIEWS\b0\par\par\uc2 882 \uc2 words\par \uc2 19 March 2013\par \uc2 The Capital Times & Wisconsin State Journal\par \uc2 XWST\par \uc2 ALL\par A11\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2013 The Capital Times & Wisconsin State Journal.

After all, liberals are for the choice of terminating a fetus, the choice of spending government transfer payments (like food stamps or unemployment payments) on whatever the recipient wants, even the choice of an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  wanting to cross the border to the United States.\par \par \uc2 And probably the greatest educational voucher ever ? the G.I. Bill ? grants veterans the choice of where to go to college. Yet we can't allow parents to choose where they send their children to school?\par \par \uc2 Regarding educational standards, is that not also a choice? Charter schools are not exempt from the public's wrath if the school selected does not perform. The parents can simply leave and send their children to another school. But when it comes to K-12 education, the public is required to pay for public schools but has no choice if the schools don't perform.\par \par \uc2 School vouchers should be supported by liberals, not opposed. Give those who are not able to pay tuition an opportunity to choose the school of their choice.\par \par \uc2 ?

John Wilson, Dane\par \par \uc2 Don't confuse Easter's God with Puritan God\par \par \uc2 In columnist Steve Chapman's Sunday piece on the "tyranny of the virtuous," he argues we must "let people make their own decisions even if they have some impact on others." This is probably necessary in a free country.\par \par \uc2 What bothers me about this column is that many readers will blame religion ? in particular Christianity ? for this "tyranny of the virtuous." This is justified because the loudest Christian voice in our country is that of the Puritan God who needs his people to enforce good behavior.\par \par \uc2 However, the God of this Easter season is not that God. As a father he has made all of his children, both good and bad. As the son, he has become a human being who has forgiven every human being's acts of misbehavior. Through the voice of the Holy Spirit, God tells us "Since you are God's loved children, free of all guilt, then behave like God's children and tell others about the father/ son/spirit God in words and actions."\par \par \uc2 The Puritan God is so much like us that if we are not looking for the father/son/spirit God in worship, in reading the Bible and in prayer, then the Puritan God will come through loud and clear.\par \par \uc2 ? John Torgerson, Wisconsin Dells\par \par \uc2 Healthy choices are worth being mandated\par \par \uc2 Steve Chapman's libertarian diatribe against Michael Bloomberg's pro-health measures in New York City is so full of hyperbole that it hardly advances rationale debate.\par \par \uc2 Indeed, use of the term "tyranny of the virtuous" or comparing Bloomberg's pro-health campaign to sexual Puritanism or Salem witch hunts seems rather sophomoric. Chapman seems to long for the days when restaurants and bars were filled with smoke, leaving patrons with the "choice" of not going to those establishments if they don't like the pollution.\par \par \uc2 Yes, people are free to "make their own decisions," but does Chapman really think we would have made any inroads in the control of tobacco illnesses without the anti-tobacco movement and lawsuits that hit the purveyors of death in their wallets?\par \par \uc2 I care less about banning large, sugary drinks, but I would like retailers to offer smaller options at lower cost. The normalization of large size drinks and candy bars has as its primary purpose the advancement of financial profit. Has Chapman been to a movie theater lately and seen the size and cost of the sodas they sell?\par \par \uc2 Consumers like me want smaller options, not libertarian rhetoric.\par \par \uc2 ?

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 It's rare and welcome to watch a movie that, reflexively, assumes people will do the right thing at the slightest provocation. That's the case with the charming comedy "Le Havre," set in France but made by Finnish writer-director Aki Kaurismaki ("The Man Without a Past").\par \par \uc2 We first meet Marcel Marx (Andre Wilms), living in the port city of Le Havre in Normandy, passing his days as a shoeshine man in the local train station. He looks like a distinguished old Frenchman, but he seems like a big kid at heart, reveling in stealing loaves of bread from a local shopkeeper on the way home from work. When he gets home, dinner isn't ready, and his wife (Kati Outinen) sends him out to the bar for an aperitif the way mothers send their sons out to play.\par \par \uc2 On one of those jaunts around town, he comes across a young African boy named Idrissa (Blondin Miguel) hiding in the water near the pier. The boy was smuggled out of Africa in a shipping container, hoping to reconnect with his father in London. Marcel, without giving it a second thought, decides to hide the boy from the immigration authorities who want to deport him. When he asks for help from his neighbors, even that shopkeeper he swipes bread from, they instantly spring into action.\par \par \uc2 As Marcel tries to figure out a way to get Idrissa out of Le Havre and off to London, "Le Havre" becomes sort of like a comedic version of "The Visitor," the Richard Jenkins drama about a widowed professor who befriends a Senegalese \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  and his wife. The film is dryly funny, as when Marcel attempts to visit one of Idrissa's relatives in a deportation facility and insists "I'm the family albino."\par \par \uc2 Kaurismaki heightens the comedy with unexpected framings, sometimes having the characters stare silently and directly into the camera or just to the side, or filming them in close-up and then backing away, the opposite of a zoom shot.\par \par \uc2 But the film's light tone is played against a very serious backdrop of immigration, especially in France, where the influx of Muslim immigrants has become a political hot-button topic. Kaurismaki gently makes fun of xenophobia, and the futility of immigration laws, but underneath the chuckles there's a sense of sorrow at the damage those laws can do.\par \par \uc2 The movie is full of odd, off-kilter moments, like an off-camera gun battle between criminals that opens the movie, and then is never referred to again. Or when the film takes a break from the story for a full performance from a gray-haired Le Havre rockabilly legend named "Little Bob."\par \par \uc2 Kaurismaki seems to be winking at us as he guides his characters towards happy endings, a couple of which openly strain credibility. "Miracles do happen," one character says, to which another responds bitterly, "Not in my neighborhood." But Le Havre turns out to have a few miracles left there after all.\par \par \uc2 LE HAVRE\par \par \uc2 ***\par \par \uc2 Andre Wilms, Blondin Miguel\par \par \uc2 Not rated\par \par \uc2 1 hour 33 minutes\par \par \uc2 Opens Friday at Sundance\par \par \uc2 "The Visitor," "Monsieur Ibrahim," the lighter side of the immigration debate\par \par \uc2 Caption: JANUS FILMS  Andre Wilms and Jean-Pierre Dassoulin star in the  quirky comedy "Le Havre."   \par \par \uc2 Document XWST000020120309e8380001k\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 FRONT\par {\*\bkmkstart toc23}{\*\bkmkend toc23}\b \uc2 CLASSES MEANT TO INFORM, ENLIGHTEN MADISONIANS ; CITY'S \uc2 ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT\uc2  POPULATION IS GROWING.; IMMIGRATION\b0\par\par\uc2 GEORGE HESSELBERG   \par \uc2 By GEORGE HESSELBERG ghesselberg@madison.com 608-252-6140\par \uc2 761 \uc2 words\par \uc2 31 August 2011\par \uc2 The Capital Times & Wisconsin State Journal\par \uc2 XWST\par \uc2 ALL\par A1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2011 The Capital Times & Wisconsin State Journal.

"Fear comes from lack of knowledge, a sense of loss of control. When you educate yourself, the fear tends to disappear."\par \par \uc2 Dane County's documented Hispanic population today is about 25,000, according to census data published by the Pew Hispanic Center.\par \par \uc2 "The Latinos are the fastest-growing minority in the country and nobody knows for sure how many undocumented there are. But in Dane County, for every one documented, there is at least one undocumented," Pine said.\par \par \uc2 With four bills coming through the Legislature identified by advocates as affecting immigrants, and with continuing nationwide attention that has grown out of Arizona's laws, Pine said the time is ripe to bring context to the local discussion.\par \par \uc2 The classes' topics are broad, from the causes and history of immigration, economics and security, beneficiaries of the current system, and solutions.\par \par \uc2 What's different, said Pine, is that questions will be answered by experts.\par \par \uc2 "The purpose (of the classes) is not to try and tell people how to think. It is to provide accurate information that lets them draw their own conclusions. No proselytizing," she emphasized.\par \par \uc2 Though the church, 2146 E. Johnson St., is sponsoring the series, this is not a course on religion, she said.\par \par \uc2 "We're looking at the system through a moral, not a religious, lens," she said.\par \par \uc2 Among those scheduled to speak are Christine Neumann-Ortiz, executive director of Voces de la Frontera in Milwaukee; Salvador Carranza, president of Latinos United for Change and Advancement; Fabiola Hamdan, a social worker at Joining Forces for Others, and Luis Yudice, a former Madison police captain who's now coordinator of safety and security for the Madison School District and head of the Dane County Task Force on Immigration.\par \par \uc2 IF YOU GO | IMMIGRATION CLASSES\par \par \uc2 WHAT: "Immigration as a Moral Issue," a series of classes to help people understand the complex issues and history of the immigration debate.\par \par \uc2 WHEN: Six consecutive Sundays starting Sept. 18, from 2 to 4 p.m., at James Reeb Unitarian Universalist Congregation, 2146 E.

Don Pridemore's immigration bill become law just to show how misguided its premise is and how reluctant most of the criminal justice system would be to implement it.\par \par \uc2 The bill requires police to detain anyone who is arrested on a civil or criminal violation who can't provide identification proving legal residence in the United States. If after 48 hours the suspect still can't cough up a driver's license, permanent resident alien card or one of several other documents specified in the legislation, police would be required to notify federal immigration officials.\par \par \uc2 And they would do ... what?\par \par \uc2 It "depends," according Leticia Zamarripa, a spokeswoman with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. If we're talking about a person stopped for one of the minor violations that make up the vast majority of the criminal justice system's workload, Zamarripa reminded me ICE's "focus is on criminal aliens."\par \par \uc2 ICE agents "can't turn a blind eye" to evidence of possible undocumented status, she said, but action in any such case "just depends what our resources are," and "ICE has very limited resources."\par \par \uc2 In other words, if you think the Feds are going to rush in to deport an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  caught going 55 in a 45 mph zone, I've got a bridge over the Rio Grande I'd like to sell you.\par \par \uc2 This correlates with what I heard about local authorities from Michael Scott, a former Madison cop and head of the UW-Madison- based Center for Problem-Oriented Policing.\par \par \uc2 "Nobody in the local criminal justice system would put very high on their priority list the deportation of otherwise law-abiding immigrants," Scott said, as the infrastructure of American local law enforcement - police, jails, district attorneys, etc. - tend to make more serious crimes the main focus of their limited time and money.\par \par \uc2 To this criticism, Pridemore pointed to a fatal crash in April in Milwaukee allegedly caused by a drunk \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  and said most criminals start small and work their way up. If the authorities had the power to deal with budding criminals of the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  variety early on, he suggested, couldn't tragedies like this be avoided?\par \par \uc2 Of course, you could say the same of budding criminals in the country legally. Shall we deport them or lock them up for long periods just to prevent them from committing worse crimes on our soil later?\par \par \uc2 I don't mean to minimize the seriousness of entering the U.S. illegally or to suggest we should simply throw open our borders to anyone.\par \par \uc2 But tailoring the punishment to the crime and making fiscally rational choices about when to crack down on lawbreakers are just as important to the operation of a just, efficient and effective criminal justice system as a single-minded focus on catching every lawbreaker, every time.\par \par \uc2 Seeking to deport an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  for speeding is not only unrealistic, it's poor crime fighting.\par \par \uc2 Contact Chris Rickert at 608-252-6198 or crickert@madison.com, as well as on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and Twitter (@ChrisRickertWSJ).

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The Capital Times editorial board met this week with Scott Walker, the Republican nominee for governor who is very much under attack by the Democratic Party, unions and liberal interest groups. It is no secret that The Capital Times has usually backed Democrats in recent years - just as we usually backed Progressives in the 1930s and 1940s and Republicans in the 1910s and 1920s.\par \par \uc2 The Capital Times has always been a progressive newspaper. But progressivism has never been the province of one party. Since the paper's founding, in the heady days when Wisconsin Sen. Robert M. La Follette was challenging the war profiteers of World War I and other corporate interests, we have always chosen principle over party. And that has meant that, in every election season, we have found Democrats and Republicans to back. We have also backed independents and third-party candidates, recognizing that the two big parties do not begin to define the range of reasonable debate.\par \par \uc2 Walker, a political veteran whose fascination with Wisconsin elections and policymaking goes back to his youth, has earned our praise and criticism over the years. When he served in the Legislature, he was one of favorite Republicans. And he knows we respect that he is running to be governor of the whole state of Wisconsin, not just the conservative wing of the Republican Party. That does not mean that we agree with Walker on most issues. In fact, quite the opposite is the case. But Walker is up for the debate and interested in looking for areas of common ground; that's to his credit. It is, as well, what distinguishes him from the extreme positioning of Republican Senate candidate Ron Johnson, who has tended to avoid serious discussions about issues and ideas.\par \par \uc2 In general, this year's sessions with the candidates of varying parties have been good-spirited and thoughtful. It serves as a reminder that, even in this hyperpartisan moment, there is still room for dialogue, debate and perhaps cooperation.\par \par \uc2 That does not mean that candidates can't be contentious. On Monday and Tuesday, Democrat Brett Hulsey and Green Ben Manski, the leading candidates in the Assembly District 77 race, came by. The candidates took some shots at one another, although I was impressed by the extent to which both of them emphasized their strengths. That appealed to me. As I have noted before in this space, I have worked on a host of democratic reform initiatives with the Liberty Tree Foundation, which Manski heads and on whose I have served. At the same time, I have known and written favorably about Hulsey for the better part of 15 years; during this campaign, he has been using a line I wrote about his work on the County Board on his literature and in radio commercials.\par \par \uc2 It may say something about the still relatively "small-town" nature of Madison that last month, both Hulsey and Manski attended a party at my home with Jim Hightower. (I was only sorry that my friend Dave Redick, the GOP candidate in the race, was not there. Dave's plan for a State Bank of Wisconsin has at least a tinge of Hightower-style populism to it.) Both Manski and Hulsey made good impressions on folks at the party; so much so that one fellow told me he wished they were running in different races so that he could vote for both of them. That may be a bit of a cop-out; Hulsey and Manski have enough honest differences to justify the race between the two. But the intelligence and energy these two candidates brought to our sessions this week was striking; they're both more focused, serious and informed than most legislators.\par \par \uc2 Of all the meetings we have had recently with candidates, the most striking for me was with Dane County Sheriff Dave Mahoney. The Capital Times editorial board endorsed Mahoney four years ago, but since then we have differed with him on some immigration questions. The Madison City Council recently voted unanimously to adopt a resolution disapproving of Mahoney's policy of contacting Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) authorities when someone appearing to be an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  is arrested, and we expressed sympathy with the council's view. When we met with Mahoney this week and immigration policy came up, however, he was not defensive. Rather, he offered a thoughtful and quite nuanced take on the issues involved. In particular, he outlined the many areas in which the Sheriff's Office has chosen not to cooperate with ICE.\par \par \uc2 Reasonable people will disagree with Mahoney on particular immigration questions, and I certainly believe that he needs to keep talking with (and learning from) his critics on this issue. But it is fair to say that our entire editorial board came away from the discussion with the sheriff struck by his sensitivity to the complex mix of human, political and law-enforcement issues that define the immigration debate.\par \par \uc2 John Nichols is the associate editor of The Capital Times. jnichols@madison.com\par \par \uc2 Copyright 2010 madison.com.

In discussing the issue, some people refer to 'illegal immigrants,' while others say 'undocumented workers.' Is there a difference?\par \par \uc2 A. As with anything related to immigration right now, the debate around terminology is heated.\par \par \uc2 Latino groups draw a clear distinction between the terms, arguing that '\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 ' distorts the debate because it suggests the person is a criminal or dangerous.\par \par \uc2 The American Civil Liberties Union issued a brief on the issue in February and said the act of being present in the U.S. in violation of immigration laws is not, standing alone, a crime. 'Unauthorized presence in the U.S. is criminally punishable only if it occurs after an individual was previously formally removed from the U.S. and then returned without permission,' it said.\par \par \uc2 Many undocumented immigrants enter the U.S. legally but overstay their visas, which is a civil violation, not a crime, the ACLU said. That's the basis for the argument used by local groups such as Latinos United for Change and Advancement, which strongly opposes use of '\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 ' and prefers 'undocumented worker.' The Associated Press stylebook, which guides usage at most U.S. newspapers, including this one, says '\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 ' is preferred over 'undocumented worker.' News organizations have defended the usage over the years, saying people who break civil laws still are acting illegally and that 'undocumented worker' makes sense only in a story addressing employment.\par \par \uc2 David Minthorn, deputy standards editor for the AP in New York, said '\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 ' is accurate and neutral for news stories. An immigrant is someone who comes into a country to settle, and illegal means a violation of the law, he said.\par \par \uc2 'Alternatives like 'undocumented worker,' 'illegal alien' or 'illegals' lack precision or may have negative connotations,' he said.\par \par \uc2 The State Journal follows AP style and uses '\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .' - Doug Erickson\par \par \uc2 Document XWST000020100806e6850000o\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 SUNDAY OPINION\par {\*\bkmkstart toc30}{\*\bkmkend toc30}\b \uc2 Support groups don't see the whole picture ; Focus: Illegal Immegration\b0\par\par\uc2 1,189 \uc2 words\par \uc2 1 August 2010\par \uc2 The Capital Times & Wisconsin State Journal\par \uc2 XWST\par \uc2 ALL\par B2\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2010 The Capital Times & Wisconsin State Journal.

Neither writer offered a viable solution to the problem.\par \par \uc2 Salvador Carranza of LUCha contributes to the inflammatory hyperbole by insinuating that anti-illegal sentiment is driven by "lies and misinformation" by anti-illegal immigration groups. It's not, if you listen to the relevant group leaders.\par \par \uc2 And Patrick Hickey of the Workers' Rights Center wrote "...employers have an unreasonable amount of control over workers, making the situation ripe for exploitation". Clearly an uncontrolled employer/worker relationship like we have now is more likely to result in exploitation than one with government oversight.\par \par \uc2 Made-up "facts" do nothing but drive us further apart, making a solution more difficult. Pro-immigration leaders need to pay attention to the relevant facts about the issue such as the failure of amnesty, control of the border and the increasing crime rate among the Latino population.\par \par \uc2 - Rick Sanson, Lancaster\par \par \uc2 Root of problem is Mexico's instability\par \par \uc2 What a sad commentary it is on the growing discrimination towards Mexican immigrants. I admire their work ethic and salute those who get in line to obtain legal visas.\par \par \uc2 Unfortunately, the root of the problem is not the immigrants, but the state of affairs in Mexico. The immigrants flee to the United States for a better life away from drug lords, corruption and poverty. They miss their culture, climate and families. Some would just as soon stay in Mexico, but the chance for survival is dwindling.\par \par \uc2 We should concentrate on the bigger picture by helping Mexico to build its infrastructure for a more stable government.\par \par \uc2 I look forward to the day when, instead of building walls, we focus our energy on building greater relationships of cooperation in commerce and open travel throughout the Americas. Maybe I'm a dreamer, but it seems like we'd have a lot more to gain and could all feel better about ourselves in the long run.\par \par \uc2 - Kathleen Williams, Monona\par \par \uc2 Build prison in Mexicofor illegal immigrants\par \par \uc2 Illegal immigrants are a major part of our economic problem. Without solving this issue, I don't believe the economy can be fixed. And neither party has had what it takes to solve it.\par \par \uc2 Illegal immigrants overload our penal system, school systems, health care and social services system. Illegal immigrants rarely contribute to the tax base which funds these programs. Some use fake documents, including drivers licenses and Social Security cards.\par \par \uc2 The government must fix the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  problem and ensure that there is an effective visiting worker program. The borders must be sealed and controlled, and those found to be here illegally must be sent back to their homelands. If this is not done, the U.S. economy will be pulled down to the level of Mexico.\par \par \uc2 It would be a good investment for a U.S. or Mexican business person to build a maximum security detention facility to house all illegal immigrants detained on U.S. soil. This facility should be built south of the U.S. border in the desert, and be run and funded by the Mexican government or private Mexican business people. House the captured illegal immigrants there rather than in U.S. prisons.\par \par \uc2 - John H. Pickle Jr., Lodi\par \par \uc2 Jobs are key - other issues are distracting\par \par \uc2 We have seized too many chances lately, and we have not gotten any of them right. Immigration will be no different.\par \par \uc2 We need jobs and more jobs, and we need them now. As for immigration, it could be done with a two-step plan.\par \par \uc2 First, secure the border and implement a better guest worker program immediately. Then provide a clear path to citizenship without any illegal immigrants bypassing legal immigrants in the process.\par \par \uc2 - M. W. "Jake" Jacobs, Pelican Lake\par \par \uc2 System works againsts killed legal immigrants\par \par \uc2 I am a member of Immigration Voice, a national organization of over 41,000 skilled legal immigrants (\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.ImmigrationVoice.org"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 www.ImmigrationVoice.org}}}\uc2  ). We are committed to sensible improvements to the employment-based immigration and green card process.\par \par \uc2 The immigration system is broken, causing hardship for families of highly-skilled immigrants. The wait times for employment-based green cards for highly-skilled workers could span six to 25 years, causing brain drain, which is hurting innovation, preventing creation of new jobs and hindering economic recovery.\par \par \uc2 I applaud Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., for his leadership in immigration reform. Recently Schumer shared his proposal for comprehensive immigration reform. This is a great first step in the right direction.\par \par \uc2 There are highly-skilled immigrants and members of Immigration Voice, including doctors, engineers, research scientists and professors, who are stuck in long green-card backlogs of over 25 years.\par \par \uc2 - Vidyadhar Gandikota, Madison\par \par \uc2 Political correctness thwarts enforcement\par \par \uc2 The country does not need to reform its immigration laws. What we need is proper enforcement of current laws.\par \par \uc2 We need to secure the borders, and require all law enforcement agencies to check on immigration status. We need to stop providing safe havens for illegal immigrants by not allowing law enforcement officers to do their jobs. We need to stop lawsuits against states that are trying to properly enforce the law.\par \par \uc2 The list could go on, but the fact is that common sense went by the wayside due to political correctness.\par \par \uc2 - Gary W. Sutherland, Brodhead\par \par \uc2 Charge employers who hire the undocumented\par \par \uc2 Congress and President Barack Obama need to enforce the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative that requires a passport or other secure identification documents for travel to and from Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean.\par \par \uc2 The United States has many visa programs for guest workers. We do not need more. We need a law that goes after employers who knowingly hire illegal immigrants for profit and sends them to prison and fines them. Congress and the president should support the federal E-Verify program.\par \par \uc2 The troops should be brought back from Iraq, South Korea, Germany and other places and be used to secure the southern border.\par \par \uc2 - Kenneth Krivanek, Baraboo\par \par \uc2 Arizona acts when Obama and Dems don't\par \par \uc2 When was the last time we saw the president of the United States sue a state that is trying to protect itself from illegal rapists, kidnappers, human-traffickers, drug smugglers, murderers and possibly terrorists?\par \par \uc2 The answer is never! President Barack Obama is telling Arizona residents he's not going to protect you, and he won't let you protect yourselves either.\par \par \uc2 Is this the only way the Democratic Party can recruit new voters? Are there that many employers dedicated to getting cheap laborers in Arizona?\par \par \uc2 Arizona's law is exactly like the federal law, except in one respect: Arizona law forbids profiling (yes, specifically forbids profiling). Federal laws require people with green cards to carry their documents with them at all times.

Middleton officials have said Mateo-Lozenzo, whom police have identified as an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Veracruz, Mexico, had transferred from Madison's West High School. "This change is made as a result of a review following that situation," Madison Superintendent Dan Nerad said in an interview Monday. "We're trying to get as much verification that we can. Understandably, there is probably no system that can be totally error-proof."Asking for proof of age will serve as a good "second-check" on information that is "provided with the student's standard registration forms and any information received from a former school," the district said in its statement to the newspaper. If documentation is unavailable, the district now will seek "a sworn statement from the person claiming knowledge of the student's age, which, if falsified, could subject the person to legal consequences."Don Johnson, superintendent of the Middleton-Cross Plains School District, which also has reviewed its enrollment policy, said the district will be more aggressive in asking for proof of age from students who don't provide it during registration.\par \par \uc2 "In every case, we'll make at least three attempts to get that birth certificate or proof of name or date of birth," Johnson said.\par \par \uc2 Still hunting for suspects\par \par \uc2 Mateo-Lozenzo; Billy Wenner-Say, 23, of Madison; Karen Giron- Cruz, 19, of Madison; Victor Prado-Velasquez, 16, of Fitchburg; and Franklin E. Yanez, 15, of Madison, have been charged with being party to first-degree intentional homicide in the slaying of Antonio Perez.\par \par \uc2 Perez, 19, was shot dead April 28 outside a Fordem Avenue business in what police are calling a gang dispute.\par \par \uc2 Giron-Cruz, Yanez and Velasquez have been ordered to stand trial. A trial for Giron-Cruz is slated for August. Yanez and Velasquez will have their final pretrial hearing next month, but no trial date has been set.\par \par \uc2 Madison police spokesman Joel DeSpain said Monday police still are looking for Mateo-Lozenzo and Wenner-Say.\par \par \uc2 Under current policy, the Madison School District only asks parents or guardians of students 17 or younger who are living with them to present a utility bill, a mortgage document or a lease with an address to enroll a child in school. School officials are directed to verify both the age and name of those students using a birth certificate or "other documentation provided by parent." But the federal McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act of 1987 requires districts to enroll students even if they can't show identification.\par \par \uc2 While the Madison School District is requesting certain students to show proof of age, the law does not require such documentation to register, officials said.\par \par \uc2 Middleton-Cross Plains also requires a parent or guardian to show residency through a utility bill, lease or mortgage document. The district requires proof of age and identification through a birth certificate or passport when a student enrolls in kindergarten, but does not require it for later grades.\par \par \uc2 Document XWST000020100728e67r0000q\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 SUNDAY OPINION\par {\*\bkmkstart toc32}{\*\bkmkend toc32}\b \uc2 Should Congress and President Barack Obama make immigration reform a major priority?\b0\par\par\uc2 2,295 \uc2 words\par \uc2 25 July 2010\par \uc2 The Capital Times & Wisconsin State Journal\par \uc2 XWST\par \uc2 ALL\par B2\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2010 The Capital Times & Wisconsin State Journal.

Nor does it ask why the federal government approves of allowing 7 million illegal immigrants, according to the Pew Hispanic Center, to keep their jobs in non-agricultural industries.\par \par \uc2 When your editorial board calls for the Wisconsin delegation to support amnesty, isn't that what most of its members, especially U.S. Sens. Russ Feingold and Herb Kohl, have been doing all along? According to NumbersUSA, Feingold and \uc2 Kohl's\uc2  grade on coddling illegal immigrants to the detriment of American workers is a miserable F-.\par \par \uc2 Feingold in particular has attacked the federal E-Verify program that is the best tool we have to keep illegal immigrants out of jobs. I sent him information about E-Verify, but he continues to deny even those statistics provided by the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees E-Verify.\par \par \uc2 - Dave Gorak, LaValle,\par \par \uc2 executive director, Midwest\par \par \uc2 Coalition to Reduce Immigration Facts, not hyperbole,\par \par \uc2 need to propel reform\par \par \uc2 Two main things need to happen to adequately reform our dysfunctional immigration system.\par \par \uc2 First, we must recognize that undocumented immigrants are not criminals. They are human beings who deserve dignity and compassion. Over 6,000 immigrants have lost their lives in the Arizona desert searching for a better life for themselves and their families, more than 460 this year alone. Our current system doesn't allow them to come here with the proper documents.\par \par \uc2 Second, we must educate the public with the facts. Anti- immigrant groups have been using lies and misinformation to distort the public's perception of immigrants. For example, it's false that coming to the United States to look for work is a crime. In fact, being in this country without a visa is a civil violation, not a crime.\par \par \uc2 It's a myth that immigrants don't pay taxes and are a burden to our communities. In fact, most immigrants pay their fare share of taxes through payroll deductions, sales taxes and property taxes. Without them, key back-breaking industries such as agriculture and the dairy industry would collapse. And few American citizens are willing to take their places.\par \par \uc2 Unless we consider the facts and not inflammatory hyperbole, comprehensive immigration reform won't happen and our nation will suffer for it.\par \par \uc2 - Salvador Carranza, Madison,\par \par \uc2 Latinos United for Changeand Advancement (LUChA)\par \par \uc2 Politicians wary of this hot-button issue\par \par \uc2 The steps outlined in Sunday's editorial seem reasonable. The problem stems from the fact that the issue is susceptible to demagoguery. A news article in the same edition told of self- appointed "enforcement" by neo-Nazis and other vigilantes in Arizona.\par \par \uc2 As long as such strong xenophobia on the part of anti- immigration zealots remains, no president of either party will score any political points for advocating practical solutions to the problem, especially when candidates for office are all too willing to cater to the most narrow-minded among the electorate.\par \par \uc2 - Roger Dobrick, Madison\par \par \uc2 Talk of amnesty causes hike in border crossings\par \par \uc2 I agree with your four principles for reform. However, certain caveats must be expressed.\par \par \uc2 I'm a Wisconsin resident, but I live 36 miles from the Arizona border eight months of the year. I have photographed and documented the activities of illegal immigrants for over five years and give slide lectures to dozens of groups in several states, including Wisconsin.\par \par \uc2 A secure border is absolutely necessary before amnesty is even discussed. Several years ago there was a flurry of discussion in Washington about amnesty that had a devastating effect on Arizona and the desert. An area several miles long became covered with backpacks and debris dropped by illegal border crossers who heard about possible amnesty and wanted to be part of it, so they came across by the thousands. That area, littered with thousands of backpacks, is now referred to as "the amnesty trail."The border can absolutely be secured with a hard-to-climb bollard fence, which would allow agents to view the other side with cameras with a range of up to 10 miles. This would give border patrol officers ample time to send agents to a particular location ahead of the crossers.\par \par \uc2 Americans, including those of Hispanic heritage, are disgusted by possible amnesty offered to those who broke the law by jumping in front of fellow citizens trying to enter our country legally.\par \par \uc2 - Gary Meinert, Boulder Junction, Wis. and Green Valley, Ariz.\par \par \uc2 Guest worker programs were tried, and failed\par \par \uc2 I commend the State Journal for taking a thoughtful position on immigration reform, especially during the current storm of hyperbole and xenophobia.\par \par \uc2 But I disagree with expanding guest worker programs. These programs have a checkered history, from the controversial Bracero program of the 1960s to more recent problems with H-2B visa programs. These programs are often plagued by issues of exploitation and declining standards for U.S. workers. If job loss means deportation, employers have an unreasonable amount of control over workers, making the situation ripe for exploitation.\par \par \uc2 Five hundred people brought from India as temporary workers to repair oil rigs after Hurricane Katrina by Signal International did not feel like "guests." They felt like slaves. When they protested about treatment and conditions, ICE colluded with the employer to try to muzzle workers. Other countries, such as Germany and France, that have tried guest worker programs have run into serious problems.\par \par \uc2 These programs are just not the American way. People who come to this country to work should have all the rights and protections afforded all workers and should be encouraged to integrate into society as rapidly as possible. This is what has made this country such a dynamic, vibrant place.\par \par \uc2 - Patrick Hickey, Madison,\par \par \uc2 director, Workers' Rights Center\par \par \uc2 Consider ways to keep part of wages in U.S.\par \par \uc2 Get our troops from Germany and Japan back to the United States and place one soldier with each border patrol agent. If a person or company needs workers, use a lottery system at the border.\par \par \uc2 Regarding illegal immigrants, give them, at a small cost, a green card if they are employed, and make them get a drivers license, insurance and learn English.\par \par \uc2 Pay half their wages in script that has to be used in the United States. That way only half of their wages will be sent back to Mexico, the rest spent here. Currently most or all is sent back to Mexico, then they get food stamps, Medicaid and so on.\par \par \uc2 Deport any who don't have jobs, or make them join the military. After two years in the military with an honorable discharge, they could become U.S. citizens.\par \par \uc2 These are some things that need to be done to keep money from leaving the United States.\par \par \uc2 - Emil Rufener, Monticello\par \par \uc2 States must step up when feds fail to enforce\par \par \uc2 It amazes me how many politicians flunked math. With states cutting back police and fire departments and other utilities and social programs because of lack of funds, politicians will not admit that immigrants are one of the biggest drains on state resources.\par \par \uc2 In Arizona there are hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants who need shelter, food, medical care and more. But they do not pay taxes for these services and feel it's their right to receive said services. Include the fact that crime rates in areas where illegal immigrants cross the border are high, which puts a strain on border patrol and local police departments.\par \par \uc2 Who is going to pay for all this? The federal government may want to sweep the immigration problem under the carpet and forget about it, but states cannot. They have to deal with the financial impact that illegal immigrants cause.\par \par \uc2 - Michyle S. Glen, Columbus\par \par \uc2 Immigration reform a matter of fairness\par \par \uc2 Immigration reform should be a major priority for both Congress and the president. Such reform should bring predictability and fairness for many groups affected by the current piecemeal and ill- considered system.\par \par \uc2 Much public attention is on the estimated 11 million immigrants who - most with no way to enter the U.S. legally regardless of how long they wait - have entered illegally in search of better lives for themselves and their families.\par \par \uc2 But they are by no means the only group that would benefit from a change in American immigration law. Employers could have a way to confirm whether a job applicant is legally entitled to work here through a much more accurate and less cumbersome system. Immigrant employees and potential employees could receive the worker protections they are entitled.\par \par \uc2 Young people brought to the United States illegally as children could have a way of earning American citizenship. People entitled to legal entry to the United States but now facing a daunting waiting period could have that waiting period reduced.\par \par \uc2 Many other improvements are being considered and could be implemented. Immigration reform is critical to confidence in the fairness and resolve of the American government.\par \par \uc2 - Welcome Fawcett, Madison\par \par \uc2 It's only effort to get at Hispanic voter bloc\par \par \uc2 Who's doing more racial profiling than Arizona these days? The Democratic Party.\par \par \uc2 President Barack Obama and his Democratic cronies will try to shove immigration "reform" down America's collective throat before the November elections, if possible, but at least before 2012. Their reasons are cynical if not dishonest.\par \par \uc2 Racial profiling is at the heart of their mission. Develop a path to legalizing illegal immigrants - the majority of whom are Hispanic - under the assumption that they will vote for Democrats to say thanks and because of the misguided belief that Democrats will take better care of them. This mirrors how Democrats have historically taken African-American votes for granted. How's that working out?\par \par \uc2 These are strategies on which the Obama regime bases its anti- Arizona and pro-\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  positions. It's not about federal jurisdiction or keeping families together. It's political and contrary to how this president promised he would govern. Again, Obama lies.\par \par \uc2 If the opportunity remains, Democratic legislators must be removed in November. If not, we can forget about 2012 and brace for the destruction of our democracy. Those of all genders, races and creeds with their hands in the treasury will unwittingly destroy it.\par \par \uc2 - Mark S. Peterson, Verona\par \par \uc2 Realistic reform requires concessions\par \par \uc2 The barrier to new immigration legislation is the last point recommended in Sunday's editorial: "Create a program to permit most of the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants now living in the United States to earn legal residency.""Comprehensive immigration reform" has become code for letting almost all illegal immigrants become voting citizens. Most conservatives, and probably most of the American people, reject that. Most liberals, and most Hispanics, demand it. Resolving this issue will require concessions on both sides.\par \par \uc2 First, it makes no difference which laws are on the books if the government can't or won't enforce them.\par \par \uc2 Second, there is much variety among the illegal immigrants. Some would be welcome as citizens in any country. But those who just recently came looking for work should be deported without hesitation. The status of millions of others falls in between.\par \par \uc2 Conservatives must admit that it's logistically impossible as well as cruel to uproot millions of people who have established lives here. Consider it our national penance for not enforcing laws in the past. Liberals must concede that not every person who touches American soil should be guaranteed residency, much less a path to citizenship.\par \par \uc2 Both sides need to quit using the word "all" when referring to illegal immigrants. Then reasonable people can work out criteria to decide who should stay and who should not.\par \par \uc2 - Wayne Shockley, Brooklyn\par \par \uc2 Close border because of drug gang threats\par \par \uc2 We need to completely close our border with Mexico before we do anything else.\par \par \uc2 The drug gangs in Mexico are murdering people in large numbers just south of our border. We have to stop them from getting a foothold in this country.\par \par \uc2 Just what is immigration reform? I think we are doing the right thing now, only it's too little, too late.\par \par \uc2 Several years ago we tried the amnesty scheme, which was only to buy votes. After that the situation just got worse because the illegal immigrants realized we weren't going to enforce our laws anyhow.\par \par \uc2 If people knew what illegal immigration is costing Arizona in free health care and education, you would want to follow their lead.\par \par \uc2 - Wesley Geringer, Black Earth\par \par \uc2 Amnesty will increase flow of Mexicans to U.S.\par \par \uc2 Last October, \uc2 Zogby International\uc2  released a poll they had run in Mexico to learn what peoples' reactions would be to immigration amnesty (sometimes referred to as a "path to citizenship").\par \par \uc2 Of Mexicans with a member of their immediate family in the United States, 65 percent said a legalization program would make people more likely to go illegally. Of those polled, 36 percent would move to the United States if they could, a figure comparable to the 33 percent found by a Pew Research poll conducted about the same time.\par \par \uc2 Sixty-nine percent thought the primary loyalty of Mexican- Americans should be to Mexico. The same percentage thought the Mexican government should represent the interests of Mexican Americans in the United States.\par \par \uc2 This poll didn't seem to receive any coverage or discussion in the mainstream press here.\par \par \uc2 - Chuck Litweiler, Madison\par \par \uc2 Document XWST000020100727e67p0001p\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 Front\par {\*\bkmkstart toc33}{\*\bkmkend toc33}\b \uc2 SCHOOLS HAMSTRUNG BY ID LAW ; DISTRICTS ARE REVIEWING POLICIES IN WAKE OF KILLING SUSPECT'S ENROLLMENT USING A FAKE NAME AND AGE.\b0\par\par\uc2 GENA KITTNER   \par \uc2 By GENA KITTNER gkittner@madison.com 608-252-6139\par \uc2 796 \uc2 words\par \uc2 14 June 2010\par \uc2 The Capital Times & Wisconsin State Journal\par \uc2 XWST\par \uc2 ALL\par A1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2010 The Capital Times & Wisconsin State Journal.

"The summary that we have compiled ... has not revealed a fix that is adequate at this point."Lisa Soronen, a lawyer for the National School Boards Association, said it's understandable that asking for identification when enrolling appears to be a simple solution to parents worried about safety. However, such a requirement may be tantamount to asking about a student's immigration status, which is problematic under Supreme Court precedent. "Some of the obvious easy solutions have other problems," Soronen said.\par \par \uc2 Parents want stronger oversight\par \par \uc2 The revelation that shooting suspect Ivan Mateo-Lozenzo, 21, was enrolled at Middleton High School as 18-year-old junior Arain Gutierrez prompted about a dozen angry and concerned e-mails from parents urging the district to enact more stringent oversight of who enrolls in the district.\par \par \uc2 "Seems to me that an age check of all students is in order. ... I can foresee two possible reasons this person was enrolled ... to sell drugs or to recruit or control gang members. Proof of age should be required of all students," e-mailed one parent.\par \par \uc2 The newspaper obtained the e-mails under the state's open records law.\par \par \uc2 Middleton officials said Mateo-Lozenzo, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Veracruz, Mexico, had transferred from West High School last fall. Mateo-Lozenzo; Billy Wenner-Say, 23, of Madison; Karen Giron-Cruz, 19, of Madison; Victor Prado-Velasquez, 16, of Fitchburg; and Franklin E. Yanez, 15, of Madison have been charged with being party to first-degree intentional homicide in the slaying of Antonio Perez.\par \par \uc2 Perez, 19, was shot dead April 28 outside a Fordem Avenue business in what police are calling a gang dispute.\par \par \uc2 Giron-Cruz, Yanez and Velasquez have been ordered to stand trial. Police still are looking for Mateo-Lozenzo and Wenner-Say.\par \par \uc2 Students don't have to show ID\par \par \uc2 The Madison School District requires the parents or guardians of a student to present a utility bill, a mortgage document or a lease with an address to enroll a child in school. Under district policy, school officials are directed to "verify age and name" of a student using a birth certificate or "other documentation provided by parent." The policy states that if a student's previous school was in a foreign country, school officials should ask to see a visa. If the student doesn't have a visa, the student still is enrolled under federal law.\par \par \uc2 Middleton-Cross Plains also requires a parent or guardian to show residency through a utility bill, lease or mortgage document. The district requires proof of age and identification through a birth certificate or passport when a student enrolls in kindergarten, but does not require it for later grades.\par \par \uc2 A district can implement any enrollment documentation it wants as long as it doesn't violate federal law, said Mary Maronek, coordinator for the state Department of Public Instruction's Education for Homeless Children and Youth program. But if a student is enrolling and he or she doesn't have identification, "they couldn't refuse enrollment," she said.\par \par \uc2 Because of McKinney-Vento, the district can't enforce a blanket policy requiring all students to provide a birth certificate or photo identification when enrolling, said district spokeswoman Michelle Larson.\par \par \uc2 The Middleton School Board is expected to take up the issue sometime this summer, she said. Madison district spokesman Ken Syke last week said the district still is reviewing its policy.\par \par \uc2 Document XWST000020100615e66e00028\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 THE CAP TIMES\par {\*\bkmkstart toc34}{\*\bkmkend toc34}\b \uc2 Letters to the Editor\b0\par\par\uc2 930 \uc2 words\par \uc2 9 June 2010\par \uc2 The Capital Times & Wisconsin State Journal\par \uc2 XWST\par \uc2 ALL\par 37\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2010 The Capital Times & Wisconsin State Journal.

UW has a horrendous history of violating animal welfare regulations and flouting public access to information laws.\par \par \uc2 Recently, PETA sued UW for withholding public documents related to invasive and deadly taxpayer-funded eye-movement experiments on monkeys and cats. In the experiments, holes are drilled into animals' skulls, electrodes are inserted into their brains, and stainless steel coils are implanted in their eyes.\par \par \uc2 In other experiments, sheep were locked in high-pressure chambers and some died from decompression sickness. Such painful deaths constitute a violation of Wisconsin law. Although an investigation by the Dane County district attorney confirmed this, UW was not prosecuted.

We should all be proud of the step Arizona has taken to protect not only its citizens but the rest of the law-abiding citizens of this nation.

However, the most benefit may be achieved by removing the legislators who allowed the people's Social Security funds to be an unlocked and unsecured reservoir for meeting the costs of "overspending" that they created in the first place.\par \par \uc2 Anyone who allowed the $2.5 trillion Social Security fund to be depleted on non-related, frivolous programs is unfit to serve and should be voted out of office.\par \par \uc2 First, we need the funds to be replaced. Second, we need a ban on using our contributions for anything other than paying back the contributors who have made the deposits. If our representatives in Washington are not savvy enough to introduce legislation to do this, let's send them home.\par \par \uc2 Last, it's obvious that leaving our funds in the hands of our representatives in Washington to "manage" gives them another way to prove their inability to do so.\par \par \uc2 - Jim Brud, Middleton\par \par \uc2 Program has become a federal 'Ponzi scheme'\par \par \uc2 Social Security, like the term "entitlement programs," has broad implications. Yet how many have considered what is provided, who pays for the benefits and - like a family budget - whether the program is within your financial capacity?\par \par \uc2 Social Security was originated in the mid-1930s as a supplement for retirement. In the beginning there were about 40 people paying in for each one receiving benefits. Now, just over two workers pay in for each current beneficiary. Since it passed, Congress has added disability and survivor benefits. None of the collected taxes for these benefits has been invested and original surpluses were spent by politicians for non-related programs.\par \par \uc2 Essentially, the U.S. government has conducted a "Ponzi scheme" just like Bernie Madoff. He went to jail, and our politicians are still passing laws and spending our money and trillions borrowed from foreign governments.\par \par \uc2 Yes, people are living longer and that should modify how the program pays out benefits. However, legislative financial abuse and fraud by politicians is also unacceptable. Benefits paid by debt merely passes on the burden to our kids.\par \par \uc2 - Clarence A. Rumpel, Stoughton\par \par \uc2 Get rid of cap and change eligibility age\par \par \uc2 Yes, we need changes in Social Security, and the first change should be to have everyone who earns money help pay. This means getting rid of the cap. Don't raise it, as has been done many times before, but get rid of it completely and have folks pay on every penny they earn.\par \par \uc2 Regarding age, that's a no-brainer. Folks are living longer today! Did you know that when Otto von Bismarck first introduced social security in Germany in the 1880s, the retirement age was actually 70?\par \par \uc2 - Pete Etter, New Glarus\par \par \uc2 If markets can be made safe, invest some funds Most people were opposed to sidelining a percentage of Social Security contributions to the security exchange market, and the last corrections to the unregulated market showed why.\par \par \uc2 But if the Security Exchange Commission would have powers to identify, observe and stop high risk and speculative transactions, it could be a secure investment market. The solution is: * Control or ban all short-selling activities including day trading.\par \par \uc2 * Buyers must hold any securities for a minimum of two years. If they are sold before that, collect 20 percent of the trade value in taxes for Social Security. All publicly traded companies should pay a minimum in dividends or interest, perhaps 4.5 percent.\par \par \uc2 * Cap all executive salaries, bonuses, options and other fringe benefits. Again, collect a high tax for the combined financial value that exceeds the established cap. Double that tax if the publicly-owned company is operating with losses.\par \par \uc2 * If a publicly-owned company files for bankruptcy, strip their officers and directors of their belongings in excess of certain amounts.\par \par \uc2 If this was done, more would participate in the securities market. Fortunes would be smaller but more widespread. Social Security would only be needed for the frail, sick and unfortunate who never had a chance to participate in the market.\par \par \uc2 - Wolfgang Risop, Madison\par \par \uc2 Change collection rates and clean up fraud\par \par \uc2 Why is it that this ongoing issue rears its ugly head when a major election is approaching?\par \par \uc2 The Social Security fund was raided for other purposes so it should be replenished.

Herb Kohl, enjoying his cushy government job, will be able to continue working for as long as he chooses. Those of us who bust our butts to make \uc2 Kohl's\uc2  life so pleasurable look at Social Security as a life line for when the body decides it has had enough, or an employer decides he would prefer a newer model.\par \par \uc2 I cannot believe the government would endorse anything as foolhardy as investing part of our Social Security in the stock market.\par \par \uc2 Remember "safe" mutual funds?

Initially it was to provide a safety net for those individuals who had insufficient means to provide for their own retirement, were disabled or in poverty.\par \par \uc2 Specifically focusing on the retirement aspect of Social Security, and taking into account the healthier older population we have today and expect to have in the future, I recommend three ways to allow Social Security to continue to meet its original intent:\par \par \uc2 * Raise the age at which individuals are eligible to receive benefits.\par \par \uc2 * Take into account income and/or wealth in determining eligibility.\par \par \uc2 * Use some combination of the above approaches.\par \par \uc2 Perhaps consider allowing those with lower incomes or individuals with lower net worth to begin collecting Social Security benefits at an earlier age, while making those with higher incomes and/or greater net assets wait to collect, or possibly never be able to do so.\par \par \uc2 This may sound unfair to the wealthy or even upper middle class.\par \par \uc2 However, if I'm fortunate enough to have sufficient assets to fund my own retirement, I'll be first in line to let others who need it have more benefit from the program.\par \par \uc2 - Tom Schwei, Fitchburg\par \par \uc2 Hiking retirement age hurts younger workers\par \par \uc2 Raising the retirement age to 70 will only worsen the unemployment rate for younger workers, as fewer jobs will be vacated and available for fresh blood.\par \par \uc2 Before dramatically raising the retirement age, we should restructure the Social Security tax so it is less regressive. Currently, it's a regressive program because payroll taxes are applied only to wage earners, not to those whose income comes from investments.\par \par \uc2 Moreover, the maximum income for the Social Security tax was $106,800 in 2009. That means a person making twice or even three times that income essentially pays less tax as a percentage of personal income.\par \par \uc2 Removing the upper limits on the tax will allow for future solvency of the system, while allowing the tax rate to be lowered for lower- and middle-income working families.\par \par \uc2 As for privatization, I am against putting Social Security in the hands of the same people whose recklessness created the current financial crisis and ruined the retirement and pension funds of so many Americans.\par \par \uc2 The folly of such a move would seem to be a no-brainer in view of our recent experience.\par \par \uc2 - Roger Dobrick, Madison\par \par \uc2 Let guest workers pay, but not collect benefits\par \par \uc2 How about this novel idea to fix our growing Social Security and \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  problems?\par \par \uc2 We could issue temporary work permits to foreigners. In exchange for the privilege of obtaining a temporary work permit, permit holders would be required to contribute to the Social Security system with the understanding that they will not be able to collect benefits in the future.\par \par \uc2 Sounds like a win-win solution for everyone.\par \par \uc2 - John Olson, Madison\par \par \uc2 Tax all income without cap or exclusions\par \par \uc2 An obvious answer to the coming Social Security deficit is payroll taxes for everyone on all their income.\par \par \uc2 Right now, those earning up to $106,800 per year (which is the great majority of Americans), pay to the limit, as do their employers. People earning over $106,800 stop there. The theory, I suppose, is that the wealthy will not live long enough to recoup all their Social Security investment.\par \par \uc2 But many people who have paid Social Security taxes all their lives die before or shortly after retirement. Illegal immigrants pay into Social Security (assuming their employers are obeying that law), but they will never collect benefits.\par \par \uc2 Can anyone provide a good, moral reason why money earned through investments should not be subject to Social Security taxes, while money earned from genuine work is? I don't think any justification for that shows up in the New Testament.\par \par \uc2 If asking high earners for payroll taxes on their entire income, just like everybody else, causes them economic hardship, they are simply bad managers of their personal finances. Poor souls, they will need to make cuts in their household budgets that most ordinary Americans have already made.\par \par \uc2 - Bill Spevacek, Mineral Point\par \par \uc2 Hard to justify the Social Security cap\par \par \uc2 There is only one real solution to keeping Social Security solvent: Remove the cap on the FICA tax.\par \par \uc2 Why is the cap $106,800? Why is there a cap at all? Why can't the well-to-do help the poor working souls have at least some sort of comfortable retirement?\par \par \uc2 I can't help but believe that some of the other "fixes" are just Band-Aids.\par \par \uc2 - Clifford Voegeli, Madison\par \par \uc2 Scrap Social Securityand start over\par \par \uc2 To better appreciate Social Security's dismal future, it would be helpful to more fully understand its past.\par \par \uc2 It was established in 1935, though the first Social Security tax wasn't levied until 1937. That tax was 1 percent of an employee's pay, matched by a 1 percent employer contribution.\par \par \uc2 It remained level until 1950, but by 1990 the tax had been raised to 6.2 percent paid by each employee and employer, for a total of 12.4 percent.\par \par \uc2 That's an astounding increase in only 40 years (see {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.ssa.gov/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 www.ssa.gov/}}}\uc2  OACT/ProgData/taxRates.html\par \par \uc2 ).\par \par \uc2 Now U.S. Sen. Herb Kohl tells us that a "modest 1.1 percent increase" can solve all that ails Social Security. Rather than believing the politicians, let's trust the numbers. Based on past history, the Social Security tax projects to total 22.8 percent by the year 2070.\par \par \uc2 Is that the mess we want to leave for future generations? It's time to recognize Social Security for what it is - a noble, but failed, experiment. It's time to start over.\par \par \uc2 - Greg Thoemke, New Glarus\par \par \uc2 Wealthy have little need for Social Security\par \par \uc2 The easiest way to help the Social Security dilemma is to eliminate the cap, which is currently $106,800. There are many people out there, including overpaid pro athletes, actors, politicians, CEOs and so on, whose income far exceeds this amount.\par \par \uc2 The counter argument to eliminating the cap is that these people are limited to the maximum Social Security payout, so their input should be limited.\par \par \uc2 However, with their inflated incomes, they should be able to provide for their retirement above and beyond their "limited" Social Security payout.\par \par \uc2 - Al Bunescu, Madison\par \par \uc2 Retirement age hike makes sense to youth\par \par \uc2 As a young person soon to enter the workforce, I am worried about the Social Security crisis. However, I believe in raising the age at which people receive retirement benefits.\par \par \uc2 As medicine and modern health care techniques improve, it is only natural that people live longer and longer. To increase the amount of funds available for retirement benefits, there would have to be either an increase in tax on each paycheck, or an increase in the time people have to wait for benefits.\par \par \uc2 The increase in taxes would cause problems for the current workforce, so I agree with the second option. I don't think a choice for young workers on how much they pay toward Social Security would be effective because many would not chose to pay at all.\par \par \uc2 - Garrett Farin, student, Madison East\par \par \uc2 Document XWST000020100604e65u0001s\par }\page {\par\fs20\uc2 FRONT\par {\*\bkmkstart toc36}{\*\bkmkend toc36}\b \uc2 Madison police to expand gang unit ; BUT THERE STILL IS NO COUNTYWIDE GANG PREVENTION COORDINATOR, WHICH MADISON POLICE CHIEF NOBLE WRAY SAYS IS NEEDED.\b0\par\par\uc2 SANDY CULLEN   \par \uc2 By SANDY CULLEN scullen@madison.com 608-252-6137\par \uc2 1,320 \uc2 words\par \uc2 23 May 2010\par \uc2 The Capital Times & Wisconsin State Journal\par \uc2 XWST\par \uc2 ALL\par A1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2010 The Capital Times & Wisconsin State Journal.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Nearly three years after a Dane County task force called for a coordinated effort to combat growing gang activity and six weeks after a gang-related homicide, the Madison Police Department will launch an expanded gang unit that has been in the works since last year.\par \par \uc2 But still lacking is a countywide gang prevention coordinator that Chief Noble Wray said is critical to addressing gang activity, including a rise in Latino gangs, which police say were involved in the April 28 shooting death of a 19-year-old Madison man.\par \par \uc2 "Our emphasis should be on how do we stop the homicide, not what do we do after the homicide," said Wray, who vowed to renew the call for a countywide gang prevention coordinator when the department introduces its new Crime Prevention Gang Unit on June 10 to representatives of community agencies and others working on issues involving gangs and youth violence.\par \par \uc2 But both county and city officials say it's not their sole responsibility to create such a position, and it isn't known how it would be funded.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, in Madison, the police department will triple the size of its gang unit, from two members to six, starting June 14. The expansion will put one gang-prevention officer in each of its five districts. Sgt. Amy Schwartz, currently with the department's Criminal Intelligence Section, will supervise the unit.\par \par \uc2 The gang officers will work closely with other officers in their districts and with police serving as educational resource officers in the city's high schools, as well as with community members, in an effort to keep youths out of gangs, Wray said.\par \par \uc2 Joel Plant, an aide to Mayor Dave Cieslewicz, said the new Crime Prevention Gang Unit already is drawing attention from other U.S. law enforcement agencies for its combined focus and its placement of gang officers in districts throughout the city.\par \par \uc2 Lt. Brian Ackeret of the North District, where the April homicide took place, said the new gang unit "will be a welcome additional resource that's definitely needed, and the timing is perfect."\par \par \uc2 In the wake of the death of Antonio Perez, the victim in the April shooting whom police identified as a member of the C14 gang, police said they feared retaliation. So far, that hasn't happened.\par \par \uc2 Police have said most of the group involved in the shooting belongs to the South Side Carnales, though court records also suggest some or all were members of MS-13.\par \par \uc2 On Friday, police on horses patrolled Warner Park, where last week a 22-year-old man was stabbed after a fight on the basketball court and two days later shots were fired. Police were investigating whether those incidents, as well as two after-school disturbances last week involving students at Metro Transit's North Transfer Point, were gang-related. Ackeret said those incidents were not related to the April homicide.\par \par \uc2 But Wray and others say a countywide coordinator is also essential to keeping efforts by police, schools, social services agencies and community organizations to combat gang issues on track.\par \par \uc2 40 gangs in Madison\par \par \uc2 Police estimate there are now more than 1,100 confirmed gang members in Madison and about 40 gangs, about 12 of which are the main Latino gangs.\par \par \uc2 The Dane County Enhanced Youth Gang Prevention Task Force recommended in August 2007 that a countywide gang coordinator's position be considered. That group's co-chairman, former Madison police Capt. Luis Yudice, who's also security coordinator for the Madison School District, first called for a "comprehensive strategy so we can all work in unison" to address gang violence in September 2005.\par \par \uc2 Since then, Yudice said, staff in Madison schools are recognizing more issues involving gangs among students, which he attributes in part to greater awareness and training.\par \par \uc2 "We have gang-involved kids in probably most of our high schools and middle schools and some of our elementary schools," he said. Staff do a good job of keeping gang activity out of the schools, he said, and work closely with students, families, police and social workers in an effort to keep students out of gangs.\par \par \uc2 Locally, the gang issue is not unique to Madison schools. "We're seeing more gang activity in the suburban school districts," Yudice said, as well as the emergence of hate groups targeting blacks and Latinos in Madison, Deerfield, Cottage Grove and DeForest.\par \par \uc2 Ivan Mateo-Lozenzo, a 21-year-old \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Veracruz, Mexico, who police say killed Perez, was enrolled as a junior at Middleton High School, where officials knew him as Arain Gutierrez, 18, and believed he had previously attended Madison's West High School.\par \par \uc2 Madison School District officials, citing federal privacy laws and district policy, have refused to say whether Mateo-Lozenzo, who is still at large, had been enrolled there. But they said they shared information with police after the homicide.\par \par \uc2 Four others charged had attended schools in Madison or Verona, according to court records.\par \par \uc2 Coordinator needed\par \par \uc2 Yudice said he had hoped a county gang coordinator would be created "to keep this issue on the front burner" and avoid duplication of services among the many entities working to address the gang issue.\par \par \uc2 Had such a position been in place, Yudice said, he believes some of the increase in the county's gang activity might have been prevented.\par \par \uc2 County Human Services Director Lynn Green said in an e-mail that the task force was a joint effort by the city and county, and its recommendation doesn't indicate that the county "should be the entity to consider creating this position."The county already spends over $16.7 million on gang prevention, intervention and enforcement efforts, and has committed the time of Delinquency Services Manager and task force co-chairman Stephen Blue "to the daily duties of the coordinator role," Green said.\par \par \uc2 Green said in an e-mail that after the April shooting, Dane County Executive Falk named Frank Rodriguez as a "program leader" with the neighborhood program to work with Latino youth.\par \par \uc2 Plant said the city agrees that a countywide coordinator is vital to the efforts to combat gang activity. "I think that the mayor would welcome a conversation with (Falk) about this position and how it might be funded," Plant said. "At this point, that conversation hasn't happened."- State Journal reporter Gena Kittner contributed to this story.\par \par \uc2 WARNING SIGNS IN YOUTHS\par \par \uc2 Signs of gang influence or involvement:\par \par \uc2 ?

How are those reports made and do any other local agencies make them?\par \par \uc2 A The only time the Sheriff's Office asks about a person's immigration status is when he is being booked into the Dane County Jail, according to Capt. Jeff Teuscher.\par \par \uc2 A question on the jail's booking sheet asks for the arrested person's birth country. The answer to that question and the personal items collected during booking - such as identification - will give deputies some idea about whether the person is in the country legally.\par \par \uc2 "We don't actually make a determination on whether they are here legally or not," Teuscher said. Rather, if the person was not born in the United States and doesn't have documents proving his legal immigration status, Immigration and Customs Enforcement is notified and it decides.\par \par \uc2 Teuscher said the birth country question is on the booking form because the United States has agreements with some countries that require law enforcement to contact the countries' consulates if one of their citizens is arrested.\par \par \uc2 It's Madison Police policy not to arrest or detain anyone solely for violating immigration laws unless ICE asks them to and a supervisor OKs the arrest.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 With more than 300 census workers in Dane County knocking on doors of those who didn't mail in census forms, community leaders in Madison voiced renewed concerns that Hispanic immigrants might avoid being counted.\par \par \uc2 "I hope to be wrong on that, but I think we are going to have an issue," said Veronica Lazo, service coordinator at Centro Hispano of Dane County and a member of a committee that worked to maximize local participation.\par \par \uc2 Hispanic leaders have worked hard to quell unfounded fears that filling out the forms exposed illegal immigrants to higher risk of deportation. But recent enactment in Arizona of a controversial law requiring police to investigate anyone they suspect of entering the United States illegally has stoked worries, Lazo and others said.\par \par \uc2 "That's not going to make you want to fill out a form for the government," Brian Grady, a Madison city planner in charge of assisting the U.S. Census Bureau locally, said of the Arizona law. "If someone hasn't sent in the mail-in response by now, I wonder if they're going to want to talk to someone who comes to their door."\par \par \uc2 Wisconsin led the nation with 81 percent of households mailing in forms by the April 28 cutoff. Dane County's overall rate was slightly higher than the state rate, but tracts with high levels of rental housing, low incomes and large numbers of Spanish speakers were as low as 64 percent. Census "enumerators" already have canvassed campus areas to catch students before classes end. Now the effort is concentrated in other low-response areas, mostly along the Beltline in Madison, the town of Madison and Fitchburg. Since May 1, nearly 1,000 have been working in the 10-county Madison region. The number nationally is 600,000. The goal is to complete the work in July.\par \par \uc2 Pushing for complete count\par \par \uc2 The 2000 census overcounted affluent whites and undercounted minorities, according to a census report. This year the bureau is pushing for a complete count, as mandated by the Constitution, because census numbers affect the distribution of political power and the geographic disbursement of $400 billion in federal aid for medical care, roads and other services.\par \par \uc2 Ashley Halase, 21, is a Baraboo native who lives in the Fitchburg end of one of those Dane County tracts with a low response rate. She says she and her husband, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Mexico, won't fill out their form because they don't want the government to have his name.\par \par \uc2 "I've heard people say that they were using it to find out how many people are in the United States illegally," Halase said. "You never know, especially with these things happening in Arizona."\par \par \uc2 Their marriage last year gave him an avenue to U.S. citizenship, but applying now would mean possible fines and a requirement to spend a year in Mexico because he's been here without documents so long, she said.\par \par \uc2 An \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who isn't worried about filling out his form is Edgar Sanchez, who moved here from Mexico City in 1996 and hasn't become a citizen. He said he doesn't want to be deported because life is better here for his family. But he's already sent in his census form.\par \par \uc2 "Everybody's concerned about it," said Sanchez. "If the police send me back, I can't help that. I just worried for too much time. Not anymore."\par \par \uc2 Reflecting neighborhoods\par \par \uc2 U.S. Census Bureau policy is to hire local residents for door-to- door work in their own neighborhoods, but Lazo and the Rev. David Smith, chairman of the committee of local officials who promoted census participation, said they haven't been able to get answers about how well the enumerators reflect the county's black and Latino makeup.\par \par \uc2 "The value of getting African-Americans and Latinos is because it reflects the neighborhoods and people feel more comfortable with people who look like they do," said Smith, interim director of South Madison Health and Family Center-Harambee and pastor of Faith Community Christian Church.\par \par \uc2 Lazo echoed Smith's concerns, and added that having fluent Spanish speakers was crucial to winning trust of recent immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Centro Hispano staff members spent many hours persuading suspicious Latinos to mail in census forms, and more time trying to recruit Spanish speakers to go door to door, she said.\par \par \uc2 The bureau will only hire U.S. citizens, although exceptions can be made for Spanish speakers who have permanent resident status or work visas. Some who are here legally backed off when they were asked to give their fingerprints for the FBI, Lazo said.\par \par \uc2 "It was really hard to overcome that," Lazo said. "It was part of the whole distrust the community has with the legal system."\par \par \uc2 Muriel Jackson, a spokeswoman in the census regional office in Chicago, said the bureau's goal is to hire census takers who reflect the community, but the bureau won't release information about how well it did in hiring Spanish speakers, minorities or residents of neighborhoods with low response rates and a high risk of undercounts.\par \par \uc2 Pat Ryan, manager of the Madison office, said on Thursday that he would release a report on the number of Spanish speaking census workers, but he didn't return phone calls Friday.\par \par \uc2 The FBI does criminal background checks on all field workers.\par \par \uc2 "We don't want criminals going to people's doors," Ryan said.\par \par \uc2 HOW IT WORKS\par \par \uc2 Census takers visit all addresses that haven't mailed in a form. If nobody comes to the door, the census taker will visit a home up to three times and try by phone three times. Census takers will ask only the questions that appear on the census form.\par \par \uc2 CAN YOU SAY NO?\par \par \uc2 Participation is required by law, (Section 221, of Title 13 of the U.S. Code), but census officials say they prefer to persuade people by pointing out that the count guides distribution of $400 billion in federal aid.\par \par \uc2 Source: U.S. Census Bureau\par \par \uc2 LOOK FOR ID\par \par \uc2 Residents approached by census workers should look for identification, said Brian Grady, a city planner who has been assisting in the count. 'All census takers carry an official ID and shoulder bag which have the U.S. Department of Commerce seal,' Grady said. 'They will provide an information sheet explaining that responses are confidential and will only ask questions that are on the form. People should keep in mind that these folks are from the community and are working on behalf of all of us.'\par \par \uc2 The Associated Press contributed to this story.\par \par \uc2 Caption: CRAIG SCHREINER - State Journal Edgar Sanchez, 40, said he moved from Mexico City to Madison with family in 1996.

They have no rights of any kind in this country. They're not entitled to jobs, welfare payments, free housing, medical care or education. Economically they are draining this country because they send millions of dollars back to relatives in Mexico and other countries.\par \par \uc2 Breaks are not given to German, Italian, Russian or Asian immigrants. They have to apply for citizenship and learn to speak English, while we accommodate the Hispanics by posting signs in Spanish. This is ridiculous.\par \par \uc2 Furthermore, we need National Guard troops on the border to help the overburdened Border Patrol, which desperately needs help. Many illegal immigrants coming in are drug runners, pushers or users, some of whom carry assault weapons. If this isn't a war-like situation, I don't know what is.\par \par \uc2 I applaud the governor of Arizona for taking action to try to remedy the problem that the U.S. government should have taken care of a long time ago.\par \par \uc2 - Donna Bergman, Reedsburg\par \par \uc2 Arizona law fails to give equal protection\par \par \uc2 Arizona's immigration law should be found unconstitutional due to, among other things, the argument that equal protection will not be appropriately enforced as provided by the U.S. Constitution.\par \par \uc2 The Constitution states in Article I, Section 8, that "Congress shall have power ... to establish a uniform rule of naturalization." The law signed by Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer requiring immigrants to have immigration documents with them to verify their status could easily be abused by authorities who could stop Hispanics at will, leading to harassment and racial profiling. It further gives police authority to request information from any individual suspected of not being a legal resident.\par \par \uc2 The law should be challenged and overturned on these merits alone. If it's not, it will fuel the profiling fire in other states with the same mentality. The impact will trickle down to everyone of non-Anglo heritage and therefore speed up the downfall of positive race relations in this country.\par \par \uc2 A positive alternative solution must be found. We simply cannot afford to sacrifice the accomplishments of the last 40 years in both civil and human rights. Equal protection under the Constitution is for everyone, not just the select few.\par \par \uc2 - Rick Buffington, Beloit\par \par \uc2 Amnesty will divide our nation even more\par \par \uc2 Since its inception, our nation has welcomed immigrants from all over the world to become legal and productive citizens. We truly are a nation of immigrants which is a good thing for all of us. But the intent of our nation's founders was never to open the flood gates for every person who wanted to come and stay here without legal documentation.\par \par \uc2 The reason Arizona enacted the current state immigration law was because the federal government has failed to secure and protect our borders. Arizona government officials and many citizens are fed up with the murders, rapes and violence involving illegal immigrants for years.\par \par \uc2 Currently the U.S. Senate is considering granting amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants residing in the United States. If this amnesty bill becomes law, it will tear our country apart and cause great divisions and strife.\par \par \uc2 Currently about 70 percent of Arizonans support their state's dramatic and courageous action to fill the void of federal border enforcement. We need to enforce current federal immigration laws instead of allowing a special interest group to dictate to the majority. Citizenship here is a right you earn and every naturalized citizen must go through the proper legal channels to accomplish it.\par \par \uc2 - Wayne Alden, McFarland\par \par \uc2 Calderon blames U.S., neglects countrymen\par \par \uc2 I am baffled by the criticism piled upon those who demand constraints for illegal immigrants. Not counting Constitutional guarantees, we now become "Nazis" for verbalizing the obvious. What part of "illegal" don't our detractors understand?\par \par \uc2 But let's assign blame where it begins, in the leadership of Mexican government. How can Mexican President Felipe Caldern criticize the state of Arizona when he creates a cesspool by driving away his own unprotected citizens? Why does he sit idly while his own people cannot afford necessities to such an extent that expatriation is their only option?\par \par \uc2 I'm sure the United States would be happy to purchase more \uc2 Pemex\uc2  products if the end game was for humanitarian reasons - it would not be the first time our country bought oil under those conditions.\par \par \uc2 Caldern's slovenly public policy is now based upon making over ten million of his own brethren into refugees, knowing that many perish in the desert. Death before dollars. How about a few protest marches on this behavior?\par \par \uc2 - Chico Buller, Sun Prairie\par \par \uc2 Mexican lineage means facing discrimination\par \par \uc2 My mother was right - Mexicans are treated worse than other minorities in this country. She was from a family of illegal immigrants who fled Mexico to escape violence.\par \par \uc2 She told me to get educated, taught me that I was to grow up and take care of a home, and told me to never reveal that I was Mexican. I was not allowed to part my hair in the middle because it accentuated my Mexican features.\par \par \uc2 In response to a Wednesday letter writer, my \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  family came to the United States and saved lives. Mama helped to develop the quick strep test as well as the meningitis vaccine. My siblings include two doctors, a physicist, a New York Times best- selling author and an interior designer. I'm a musician. We are not murderers, rapists or "coyotes."\par \par \uc2 At age 19, I was stopped at the Canadian/U.S. border and almost not allowed back into the U.S. I was threatened with deportation, and I had done nothing wrong except giggle when asked for proof of citizenship. This was 1979 when crossing back and forth to Canada was easy.\par \par \uc2 A couple of years later, my aunt was nearly deported back to Mexico. I have faced racism my entire life. Now I am applying for a passport card just in case.\par \par \uc2 - Nancy Orr, Madison\par \par \uc2 Sheriff should report illegal immigrants\par \par \uc2 Dane County Sheriff Dave Mahoney is right regarding informing federal authorities of illegal immigrants in his custody. Mexican law allows their law enforcement agencies to jail illegal immigrants when caught (although this fact should have no bearing on how we enforce our laws). Why should any State in the United States not do the same?\par \par \uc2 The sheriff's decision to report the names of illegal immigrants should not be changed unless for the better, which would be to put them on a bus with a one way ticket to the nearest city in Mexico.\par \par \uc2 An \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , and is not someone to be sequestered and protected against deportation. They might be welcomed with open arms if they were here legally, but the fact is, they broke our laws and because of that they are criminals.\par \par \uc2 - Don Murphy, Madison\par \par \uc2 Liberals want illegal immigrants' votes\par \par \uc2 I praise Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer for her action in signing a law which deals with illegal immigrants. What part of "illegal" is so hard to understand? They are law breakers and considered to be criminals who do not have rights. We are a nation founded on laws.\par \par \uc2 Does anyone consider the risks that they bring, some being drug runners with weapons? No one knows the dangers like the police and guards. Do the liberals want to allow them to come in order to get more votes and power?\par \par \uc2 Most Americans are for securing our borders. Doesn't anyone listen to the people? Let's also require everyone to have a photo ID. That's the only safe, sure way to keep felons from voting.\par \par \uc2 As far as violent protests, I guess that says that our tea party movement is peaceful in trying to get the administration's attention. We are for faith, hope and charity as in the U.S. Constitution. Does the anti-American crowd ever think of what this great country was founded on? Peace-loving people.\par \par \uc2 There are over 40,000 illegal immigrants in Wisconsin, draining our social services, schools and emergency rooms, among other services. They know how to get these services, too. I am somewhat furious about this.\par \par \uc2 - Arlene M. Huffman, Monroe\par \par \uc2 Impeach Obama for failing to enforce laws\par \par \uc2 It is a fact that the guilty party in this matter is the federal government and the current president who finds it difficult to fulfill his oath of office to defend this country from both foreign and domestic enemies.\par \par \uc2 My grandparents came through Ellis Island legally, not illegally. They were granted legal citizenship by meeting all the requirements.\par \par \uc2 People coming over the border illegally are foreign law breakers. They do not deserve any protection under any of laws granted those who came into this country through legal channels. If the president doesn't enforce the law, then he has broken his oath and should be impeached for not fulfilling his requirement for the office.\par \par \uc2 Every person - no matter what race, creed, color or national origin - who is in this country outside of the legal requirements should be deported, not supported. That is the law, and government on all levels should be held accountable to enforce those laws. Any and all methods should be used to enforce these laws.

The records list a birth date of Jan. 1, 1992, although Dane County Sheriff's Office records show Mateo-Lozenzo was born Jan. 14, 1989.\par \par \uc2 The Middleton records list a Madison address and say he was attending the Middleton school under a waiver and was enrolled for next year.\par \par \uc2 Madison officials won't confirm Mateo-Lozenzo ever attended West or any other school in the district, citing district policy not to disclose information about current or former students unless "it relates to educational activities, school-related functions or has a legitimate educational purpose."\par \par \uc2 Five accused in shooting\par \par \uc2 Mateo-Lozenzo; Billy Wenner-Say, 23, of Madison; Karen Giron- Cruz, 19, of Madison; Victor Prado-Velasquez, 16, of Fitchburg; and Franklin E. Yanez-Hernandez, 15, of Madison have been charged with being party to first-degree intentional homicide in the murder of Antonio Perez.\par \par \uc2 Perez, 19, was shot dead April 28 outside a Fordem Avenue business in what police are calling a gang dispute.\par \par \uc2 All but Prado-Velasquez are in the country illegally, according to Madison police.\par \par \uc2 Sheriff's records show that Wenner-Say, the other suspect not captured by police, listed his school as Memorial High School in Madison, and a police search of his residence turned up a Memorial identification card. But the records don't indicate when he went to school there.\par \par \uc2 Giron-Cruz was formerly a student at West, a teacher there verified. Prado-Velasquez attended Verona High School. It's unclear whether Yanez-Hernandez was enrolled in school.\par \par \uc2 Under the state constitution, all residents from age 4 to 20 are entitled to a free public education, said Patrick Gasper, state Department of Public Instruction spokesman. A 1982 U.S. Supreme Court ruling prohibits districts from withholding public education because of immigration status.\par \par \uc2 In Wisconsin, students must attend school in the district where they live unless they get an open-enrollment waiver to attend elsewhere, Gasper said. Districts can set their own policies on how to prove residency, he said.\par \par \uc2 Documentation needed\par \par \uc2 The Madison School District requires the parents or guardians of a student to present a utility bill, a mortgage document or a lease with an address to enroll a child in school. Under district policy, school officials are directed to "verify age and name" of a student using a birth certificate or "other documentation provided by parent."\par \par \uc2 The policy states that if a student's previous school was in a foreign country, school officials should ask to see a visa. If the student doesn't have a visa, the student is still enrolled.\par \par \uc2 Middleton-Cross Plains also requires a parent or guardian to show residency through a utility bill, lease or mortgage document, said district spokeswoman Michelle Larson. The district requires proof of age and identification through a birth certificate or passport when a student enrolls in kindergarten, but does not require it for later grades, she said.\par \par \uc2 Citing student privacy reasons, the district would not release what proof of residency or age Mateo-Lozenzo, his family or guardian provided. Larson said he was already listed in a state database of students, and officials "wouldn't have any reason to question the legitimacy of the information" provided for his enrollment into Middleton High School.\par \par \uc2 A man who answered the door at the residence listed in the Middleton district records said Mateo-Lozenzo had lived there at one point. The man declined to give his name or speak further.\par \par \uc2 Police went to the Middleton-Cross Plains School District on April 29 - the day after the shooting - with information that Gutierrez could be a Middleton High School student, which the district confirmed through its records and a student photo, Larson said.\par \par \uc2 State Journal reporters Mary Spicuzza and Dee J.

Nowhere is this more evident than in the case of the Arizona immigration law. In the debate over this law, illegal immigrants have been cast as evil law- breakers and Hispanic Americans have become suspicious because of the color of their skin.\par \par \uc2 The real issue is if there were not an active job market for illegal immigrants, they would not come here to find work. Why are we attacking illegal immigrants when we have employers, both large and small, saying "Come on over, we have work for you!"\par \par \uc2 If we really wanted to stop illegal immigration, we would make the punishments for employing an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  so draconian that no one would ever hire one again. Why not jail the contractor who picks up a day laborer, or slap a politician with a million dollar fine for having an undocumented nanny?\par \par \uc2 Let's recognize who the real villains are in this debate and hold them responsible.\par \par \uc2 - Patrick Olson, Sun Prairie\par \par \uc2 Agencies supporting disabled threatened\par \par \uc2 It was great to see Sunday's "Know Your Madisonian" on Phil Porter, a real Madison treasure. I'd like to add a dose of reality to Phil's story and the stories of hundreds in the same boat.\par \par \uc2 I am the long-term president of Integrated Community Work, a supported employment agency that has worked with Porter for years. ICW and agencies like it provide job-related service to developmentally disabled adults, helping to ensure their lives are richer than they would have been years ago when, for instance, Porter was warehoused in large institutions.\par \par \uc2 In the past few years, supported employment agencies (and residential agencies, too) have suffered from horrific, county- imposed, budget cuts, resulting in growing unmet need in our area.\par \par \uc2 If the story about Phil Porter moved you (and how couldn't it?), drop a line to your county supervisor and to the Dane County executive as a way of giving Phil a pat on the back and making sure he can keep doing what he loves: making others happy.\par \par \uc2 - Joe Davis, Madison\par \par \uc2 Wood should donate salary to MADD\par \par \uc2 Rep. Jeff Wood has been convicted three times for driving under the influence. I spent years as a volunteer EMT and firefighter in rural Wisconsin, and I also worked in organ and tissue donation. I've seen firsthand the destruction people like Wood leave in their paths when they choose to drive under the influence.\par \par \uc2 Wood was elected to help govern Wisconsin and to keep us safe by enacting laws that protect us, such as Wisconsin Code 346.63, which prohibits people from driving under the influence of alcohol and other drugs. Wood ignored that law and endangered every Wisconsinite on the road.\par \par \uc2 That's why I'm unwilling to pay his salary with my tax dollars while he serves his sentence. By my calculations, he'll earn around $6,000 while serving his 45-day sentence. Why should I pay him my hard-earned dollars while he's serving time for endangering my safety by driving under the influence?\par \par \uc2 I demand that he donate the $6,000 he'll earn while being punished for his third drunken driving offense to Mothers Against Drunk Driving or a similar program.\par \par \uc2 - Chris Truitt, DeForest\par \par \uc2 Support needed for fine arts in schools\par \par \uc2 I have long admired the fine work done by Madison Symphony Orchestra's Tyrone and Janet Greive in this area for so many years. I thank them for their efforts.\par \par \uc2 As Greive noted in his Friday guest column, the ability level of college orchestras, including those at UW-Madison, has become very high. The directors are also wonderful - I've been watching the exemplary work of orchestra director James Smith and choir professor Beverly Taylor with the university orchestras for years, and recommend that readers attend upcoming university opera and choir concerts.\par \par \uc2 Growth in the quality and number of public school orchestra programs and youth orchestras began after World War II, along with a move toward a more diverse curricular program, based on growing knowledge of human learning.\par \par \uc2 However, with the current economic problems we face, school arts programs are in jeopardy. The big thing about the cuts this time is that they are not scare tactics or teachers' union "bargaining" moves. These cuts are real, and may be permanent.\par \par \uc2 America has bailed out greedy banks with executives making multi- millions per year, but it can't seem to support fine arts in the schools, much less education in general, the way it should.

America is not alone in the world in its hostility toward immigrants and in our history we have done better than many nations in creating pathways for immigrants to become part of our society. But now, with unemployment continuing at high rates, it is easy to engender even harsher feelings toward immigrants than at other times - especially if they are here without legal standing.\par \par \uc2 But this is more than a legal issue. It is a moral issue about how human beings treat each other.\par \par \uc2 Despite President Obama's passing reference in his State of the Union speech to immigration reform, the political realities make such reform highly unlikely this year, leaving those who have been here for a long time without documentation as vulnerable as ever.\par \par \uc2 I'm not just talking about vulnerability to deportation. I'm talking about their vulnerability to economic exploitation - yes, right here in the Madison area. I'm talking about their vulnerability to a national system of immigration jails that is often Kafkaesque - a system that the nation tolerates because we find it so easy to dismiss people who risk much to support their families as simply being foreign lawbreakers.\par \par \uc2 There are numerous religious groups in this country that continue both to care for immigrants on a personal basis and to advocate for reforms that will make this whole system more humane. Within the Jewish and Christian traditions, there are strong statements in their Scriptures about welcoming the alien, about treating the foreigner with respect and care - with understanding that all are equal in God's vision.\par \par \uc2 Rabbi Renee Bauer, who is director of the Interfaith Coalition for Worker Justice of South Central Wisconsin, talked recently about the workers, most of them Latino, who come into her office each and every day. "Most often they come in because they have not been paid for hours they have worked," she said. "They are forced to clock out and then continue working overtime without pay. Or they are fired and not paid for their last two weeks of work. Or they are contract workers and are just simply not paid."\par \par \uc2 Last month, the New York Times reported on the silence that surrounds the deaths of men and women in immigration jails. "For years, they went uncounted and unnamed in the public record," wrote reporter Nina Bernstein. In 2008, the Times got a list of the names of those who had died, but still could get very little information about who these people were or how they died.\par \par \uc2 Yes, I know when people come into this country illegally, they are taking on a certain amount of personal risk. They understand that they may well be sent back to their home country. But that does not justify the slurs they face from so many people in public debate, the exploitation by employers who use their labor and then cheat them out of wages because they have little recourse, or a penal system that treats them as cattle.\par \par \uc2 Across the centuries, nations all over the world have struggled with immigration. In the U.S., where the vast majority of us are descendants of immigrants, we surely can do better.\par \par \uc2 Phil Haslanger is pastor of Memorial United Church of Christ in Fitchburg.
