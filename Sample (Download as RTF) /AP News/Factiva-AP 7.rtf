\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc1}{\*\bkmkend toc1}\b \uc2 Appeals courts asked to review Ala., Ga. immigration laws after \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2  decision\b0\par\par\uc2 By KATE BRUMBACK and JAY REEVES   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 889 \uc2 words\par \uc2 6 July 2012\par 21:48\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2012.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ATLANTA (AP) - Lawsuits challenging Alabama's and Georgia's laws targeting illegal immigration went back before a federal appeals court Friday as attorneys from both sides asked judges to reconsider the crackdowns in light of a recent \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2  ruling.\par \par \uc2 The state of Georgia filed papers with the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals arguing that its law should be upheld based on the \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2  ruling on a similar law enacted by Arizona.\par \par \uc2 However, Alabama conceded that parts of its law similar to the Arizona statute were blocked by the \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2  decision while saying other sections should be allowed to take effect, including a provision that requires public schools to check students' citizenship status.\par \par \uc2 Opponents in both states argued that lawmakers there overstepped their authority in passing laws that encroach on federal powers.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2  upheld a section of Arizona's law that requires police to check the immigration status of those they stop for other reasons. It also struck down three key sections that would: require all immigrants to obtain or carry immigration registration papers; make it a state criminal offense for an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  to seek work or hold a job; and allow police to arrest suspected illegal immigrants without warrants.\par \par \uc2 The 11th Circuit in March heard arguments in challenges to both Georgia and Alabama's illegal immigration crackdowns, but the three-judge panel said at the time that it would wait to rule until after the \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2  had acted in the Arizona case. Friday was the deadline for lawyers in those cases to submit new briefs based on the \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2  ruling.\par \par \uc2 One part of Georgia's law that was blocked last year by a federal judge is "more tempered" but "bears close similarity in all respects" to that section, Georgia's lawyers argue in their filing with the 11th Circuit. Georgia's law would authorize law enforcement officers to try to verify a suspect's immigration status during an investigation if the officer has probable cause to believe the person has committed a criminal violation.\par \par \uc2 But neither the Georgia law nor Alabama law limits the duration of immigration statute determinations and could lead to people being detained for excessive lengths of time for status verification, the opponents' court filings argued. The \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2  did express concerns about such detentions and said Arizona's law should be read to avoid concerns that status checks could lead to prolonged detention.\par \par \uc2 Georgia's law does not contain provisions that are similar to the sections of Arizona's law that were struck down by the \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2 , Georgia's court filing says.\par \par \uc2 Opponents of the law dispute that claim. They say a second section of Georgia's law that was blocked last year and that would make it a crime to transport or harbor an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  during the commission of another offense violates some of the same principles as the Arizona law provisions that were struck down.\par \par \uc2 Georgia's lawyers argue that that section mirrors federal law and does not hinge on the immigration status of the person committing the crime. But parts of the Arizona law were tossed because they fell under the responsibility of the federal government, not the states, and opponents of Georgia's law say the state is going beyond its authority because it "prohibits a different, broader range of conduct than the federal harboring law."\par \par \uc2 The state of Georgia makes a key distinction between the challenges to the Georgia and Arizona laws. Arizona's law was challenged both by activist groups and by the federal government, while Georgia's was challenged only by a coalition of activist groups and individuals. The \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2  heard only the federal government challenge to Arizona's law.\par \par \uc2 Groups including the Hispanic Interest Coalition of Alabama and the Southern Poverty Law Center argued that the \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2  ruling that blocked much of Arizona's law means sections of the Alabama law also are unconstitutional. Parts of the Alabama law are "indistinguishable" from Arizona's, opponents argued, including sections that make it a crime for illegal immigrants to seek work or fail to register.\par \par \uc2 Alabama's one-of-a-kind requirement that public schools check the citizenship status of students is unconstitutional because it amounts to an unconstitutional registration scheme, critics of the law claimed. The state argued, however, that legislators' reworking of the law this year eliminated a problematic section and means the citizenship checks should go forward.\par \par \uc2 Critics argued that changes to Alabama's law didn't fix the problems that made it unconstitutional to begin with.\par \par \uc2 A big part of the challenges to the state laws targeting illegal immigration has centered on federal pre-emption, whether the states are overstepping their authority by wading into immigration regulation. Georgia argues in its court filing that the private parties that challenged its law don't have the standing to argue against the law on pre-emption grounds.\par \par \uc2 Critics of the state laws also argue that they could lead to racial and ethnic profiling. The states have argued that the laws specifically prohibit profiling.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Follow Brumback at: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://twitter.com/katebrumback"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://twitter.com/katebrumback}}}\uc2 .

(AP) - An \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  says an Obama administration change to U.S. immigration policy means there are no grounds to deny him a Florida law license.\par \par \uc2 President Barack Obama announced last month that illegal immigrants no older than 30 who arrived as children, have no criminal history, and have high school degrees or military service could stay and work in this country.\par \par \uc2 In a motion filed Thursday, Jose Godinez-Samperio told the state Supreme Court that the administration's order makes him eligible for legal immigration status and work authorization in the U.S.\par \par \uc2 "The significance of this action for (Godinez-Samperio) and for the issues before this Court cannot be overstated," says the motion filed in Tallahassee by Godinez-Samperio's attorney, Talbot D'Alemberte. "No grounds remain for denying or further delaying his admission to the Florida Bar."\par \par \uc2 The motion asks the court to order the Florida Board of Bar Examiners to either conclude its investigation into Godinez-Samperio's application or admit him.\par \par \uc2 Godinez-Samperio's parents brought him to the U.S. from Mexico on a visitor's visa when he was 9. His parents overstayed their visas and never returned to Mexico. He grew up in rural Hillsborough County. His father, a veterinarian in Mexico, milked cows on a dairy farm. His mother, a dentist, worked at a factory that made sliding glass doors.\par \par \uc2 Godinez-Samperio, 25, graduated from Florida's New College, earned a law degree from Florida State and passed the bar exam. The Florida Board of Bar Examiners, though, declined to admit him, instead asking the justices for an advisory opinion on whether illegal immigrants can be licensed as lawyers.\par \par \uc2 Earlier this year, seven U.S. representatives and Puerto Rico's nonvoting resident commissioner joined four former American Bar Association presidents in urging the state Supreme Court to grant Godinez-Samperio a law license.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120707e8770033g\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc3}{\*\bkmkend toc3}\b \uc2 Appeals courts asked to review Ala., Ga. immigration laws after \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2  decision\b0\par\par\uc2 By KATE BRUMBACK and JAY REEVES   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 889 \uc2 words\par \uc2 6 July 2012\par 19:40\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2012.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ATLANTA (AP) - Lawsuits challenging Alabama's and Georgia's laws targeting illegal immigration went back before a federal appeals court Friday as attorneys from both sides asked judges to reconsider the crackdowns in light of a recent \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2  recent.\par \par \uc2 The state of Georgia filed papers with the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals arguing that its law should be upheld based on the \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2  ruling on a similar law enacted by Arizona.\par \par \uc2 However, Alabama conceded that parts of its law similar to the Arizona statute were blocked by the \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2  decision while saying other sections should be allowed to take effect, including a provision that requires public schools to check students' citizenship status.\par \par \uc2 Opponents in both states argued that lawmakers there overstepped their authority in passing laws that encroach on federal powers.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2  upheld a section of Arizona's law that requires police to check the immigration status of those they stop for other reasons. It also struck down three key sections that would: require all immigrants to obtain or carry immigration registration papers; make it a state criminal offense for an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  to seek work or hold a job; and allow police to arrest suspected illegal immigrants without warrants.\par \par \uc2 The 11th Circuit in March heard arguments in challenges to both Georgia and Alabama's illegal immigration crackdowns, but the three-judge panel said at the time that it would wait to rule until after the \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2  had acted in the Arizona case. Friday was the deadline for lawyers in those cases to submit new briefs based on the \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2  ruling.\par \par \uc2 One part of Georgia's law that was blocked last year by a federal judge is "more tempered" but "bears close similarity in all respects" to that section, Georgia's lawyers argue in their filing with the 11th Circuit. Georgia's law would authorize law enforcement officers to try to verify a suspect's immigration status during an investigation if the officer has probable cause to believe the person has committed a criminal violation.\par \par \uc2 But neither the Georgia law nor Alabama law limits the duration of immigration statute determinations and could lead to people being detained for excessive lengths of time for status verification, the opponents' court filings argued. The \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2  did express concerns about such detentions and said Arizona's law should be read to avoid concerns that status checks could lead to prolonged detention.\par \par \uc2 Georgia's law does not contain provisions that are similar to the sections of Arizona's law that were struck down by the \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2 , Georgia's court filing says.\par \par \uc2 Opponents of the law dispute that claim. They say a second section of Georgia's law that was blocked last year and that would make it a crime to transport or harbor an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  during the commission of another offense violates some of the same principles as the Arizona law provisions that were struck down.\par \par \uc2 Georgia's lawyers argue that that section mirrors federal law and does not hinge on the immigration status of the person committing the crime. But parts of the Arizona law were tossed because they fell under the responsibility of the federal government, not the states, and opponents of Georgia's law say the state is going beyond its authority because it "prohibits a different, broader range of conduct than the federal harboring law."\par \par \uc2 The state of Georgia makes a key distinction between the challenges to the Georgia and Arizona laws. Arizona's law was challenged both by activist groups and by the federal government, while Georgia's was challenged only by a coalition of activist groups and individuals. The \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2  heard only the federal government challenge to Arizona's law.\par \par \uc2 Groups including the Hispanic Interest Coalition of Alabama and the Southern Poverty Law Center argued that the \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2  ruling that blocked much of Arizona's law means sections of the Alabama law also are unconstitutional. Parts of the Alabama law are "indistinguishable" from Arizona's, opponents argued, including sections that make it a crime for illegal immigrants to seek work or fail to register.\par \par \uc2 Alabama's one-of-a-kind requirement that public schools check the citizenship status of students is unconstitutional because it amounts to an unconstitutional registration scheme, critics of the law claimed. The state argued, however, that legislators' reworking of the law this year eliminated a problematic section and means the citizenship checks should go forward.\par \par \uc2 Critics argued that changes to Alabama's law didn't fix the problems that made it unconstitutional to begin with.\par \par \uc2 A big part of the challenges to the state laws targeting illegal immigration has centered on federal pre-emption, whether the states are overstepping their authority by wading into immigration regulation. Georgia argues in its court filing that the private parties that challenged its law don't have the standing to argue against the law on pre-emption grounds.\par \par \uc2 Critics of the state laws also argue that they could lead to racial and ethnic profiling. The states have argued that the laws specifically prohibit profiling.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Follow Brumback at: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://twitter.com/katebrumback"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://twitter.com/katebrumback}}}\uc2 .

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc5}{\*\bkmkend toc5}\b \uc2 Illegal immigrants who grew up in US hope Indiana college will give them brighter future\b0\par\par\uc2 By VICTORIA ISON   \par \uc2 The Herald-Times\par \uc2 1,109 \uc2 words\par \uc2 4 July 2012\par 10:08\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2012.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) - Fred Diego is sitting on a bench in the hot sunshine. It's a summer afternoon outside the Indiana Memorial Union, with students on their laptops, seeking shade and drinking \uc2 Starbucks\uc2  beverages.\par \par \uc2 Right now, 20-year-old Diego is leaning back in his seat and laughing about discrimination.\par \par \uc2 "Noooo," he says, when asked whether strangers would guess he's a good student. "People don't even think I go to college."\par \par \uc2 Then his expression changes, and his voice loses the laughter.\par \par \uc2 "That's the kind of discrimination we face," he says, searching for the right words, "A general disregard for our capacity."\par \par \uc2 Diego has a full-ride to IU. He's also an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Originally from San Nicolas, Mexico, Diego grew up in Chicago and graduated from George Rogers Clark High School in Hammond. His parents brought him to the U.S. when he was not yet 3 years old.\par \par \uc2 "It's not like we had a choice," Cristian Delgado, a friend, full-ride scholarship recipient and fellow \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  says, entering the conversation. Delgado's family left Mexico City when he was 7, and raised him in Indianapolis. "What was I supposed to do -- say, `Naw, Dad, don't bring me'?"\par \par \uc2 Diego nods, agreeing. "You're a 2-year-old kid. You can't.\par \par \uc2 "That's one thing about Latin Americans; we have these really strong family ties. ... They brought us here so we could be a family, so we could thrive as one."\par \par \uc2 Diego knows his parents broke the law by coming to the U.S. without papers, but when he speaks about their sacrifice, you can see the respect he has for it.\par \par \uc2 "They gave up their families," he said. "My dad knew coming here that he wasn't going to be there when his mom died, when his dad died. He gave up being next to his father when he had his last breath."\par \par \uc2 The stories of Mexican immigrants coming to the U.S. for opportunity are as prevalent as the immigration issue is controversial.\par \par \uc2 But for Diego, that story is his life.\par \par \uc2 "My dad, he always wanted to own his own house and have his own car. I remember him telling me a conversation he had with my mom when my mom didn't want to come to the States," Diego says. "My dad said, `We come to the States, I can buy a house -- he was a truck driver -- I can buy my truck. We can have one or two cars; we can go out to eat every weekend if we want. Those things sound really normal to us. ... Things that are simple, things that are negligible parts of everyday life here, like new clothes every season, are luxuries in Mexico."\par \par \uc2 Delgado agrees, nodding and gesturing at his shorts and tennis shoes.\par \par \uc2 "The vast majority of Mexico's wealth is concentrated in a very small portion," Diego continues. "Sure, there's a Chili's and a Sears and Roebuck in Mexico, you can buy an Xbox and games in Mexico -- but you really can't. A very select group of people can, and it's not everybody else."\par \par \uc2 Diego has to rely on what he's read and heard from family about Mexico -- he's never been there. If he leaves to visit, he wouldn't be able to come back.\par \par \uc2 There's also the chance that he could be kidnapped. Since his family is in the U.S., people in Mexico think they have a lot of money, Diego says, and he'd be at "marginal risk" for violence or extortion.\par \par \uc2 Life in the U.S. is all he's known, but it's not his legal life. Living here, Diego and Delgado are both at risk of deportation.\par \par \uc2 "You literally live in this borderland, this very nebulous, very tumultuous place where your life is governed by uncertainty," Diego says. "But to most kids here, that wasn't an issue until they turned 16 and tried to get a job and realized they were undocumented. ... Now at this point, we're 20 years old. In two years we're planning to graduate and we're going to want to get jobs."\par \par \uc2 "What are we going to do with our degrees?" Delgado asks.\par \par \uc2 The question hangs in the air.\par \par \uc2 Delgado wants to be a teacher and soccer coach. Diego is studying cognitive science. They aren't sure yet what they'll do to get jobs, or where their lives will go after graduation. Right now, neither of them drive, because they don't have the documentation needed to get licenses.\par \par \uc2 Both are involved in the Indiana Student Coalition for Immigrant Rights, an organization represented on several college campuses around the state. Through it and DREAM IU, a club started to support the DREAM Act, which would have given amnesty to the undocumented children of illegal immigrants, they give presentations to classes. They educate students on the hundreds of thousands of young adults in positions like theirs and advocate for legislation that would make the futures they want accessible to them.\par \par \uc2 "At first, I was afraid of saying anything because I didn't know who to trust, and then I started, like, networking with people, started coming out of my shell," Delgado says. "I'd tell what happened, this and that, and now they (my friends) have my back; they're supporting me."\par \par \uc2 If Diego and Delgado are concerned about being named publicly as illegal immigrants, they do a good job of hiding it.\par \par \uc2 "What do you mean?" Diego asks, when questioned about sharing his situation publicly. "That's the only persona I have."\par \par \uc2 "Yeah, I don't think I have any other status," Delgado says. "We'll speak up. We're coming out of the shadows."\par \par \uc2 While the fear of deportation is real, the memorandum President Barack Obama gave executive authority on June 15 promises some security. It allows young adults who graduated from high school in the U.S. and "low-priority" illegal immigrants who meet a number of other eligibility criteria to receive deferred deportation status for two years.\par \par \uc2 "We want nothing more than to give to society, to be full members of society, with all its good and bad things," Diego says. "We'll pay taxes and we'll vote. We'll help and we'll work jobs and we'll be great members of the community -- and we won't be criminals, we promise."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Information from: The Herald Times, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.heraldtimesonline.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.heraldtimesonline.com}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120704e874001h8\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Houston Chronicle. June 29, 2012.\par \par \uc2 Roberts rules with health care opinion\par \par \uc2 On Thursday the U.S. Supreme Court proved once more the wisdom of the axiom that those who say they know how the court will rule don't; and those who do know aren't saying.\par \par \uc2 The majority ruling written by Chief Justice \uc2 John Roberts\uc2  was nuanced, judicially restrained and admirably free of politics. It upheld the controversial individual mandate portion of the Affordable Care Act, but as a tax rather than an action governed by the Constitution's commerce clause.\par \par \uc2 The chief justice's opinion that the individual mandate is a tax clears up the central question that has vexed the act: How do we pay for it? This allows Congress and the executive branch to deal with the other major questions: How do we best implement the act, and how do we make the act better?\par \par \uc2 At the same time, the Roberts opinion also forbade the federal government from withholding all Medicaid funds from states that refuse to participate in the vastly expanded Medicaid plan. This ruling will have a particular impact on Texas and several other states that have pushed back from participation in Medicaid and are reluctant to participate in the newly expanded version.\par \par \uc2 Thursday was a landmark day for the \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2  as an institution and \uc2 John Roberts\uc2  as its leader. The court and its chief rose above criticisms from the Obama administration that it has become an activist court controlled by the interests of the corporate right, proving themselves instead to be the oasis of reason and legal rigor it was ordained by the Founders to be.\par \par \uc2 The Roberts court's 5-4 ruling, in which the chief justice joined with the court's four liberal justices to form the majority, shows both the wisdom of this chief justice and the flexibility of the Constitution.\par \par \uc2 Roberts and the court majority correctly identified the constitutionality of treating the ACA's individual mandate, which requires all individuals to participate by identifying it as a tax allowable under Congress' constitutional powers of taxation, notwithstanding President Obama's oft-argued position that it was not a tax. The government's lawyers made the case that the mandate was constitutional as a tax, and the high court majority agreed.\par \par \uc2 Now comes the hard part -- the politics. Poll after poll has shown that 60 percent or more of Americans do not favor the 2,000-plus-page bill approved by Democratic majorities in both houses of Congress and signed by the president with virtually no Republican participation.\par \par \uc2 Disaffected Republican voters first made their displeasure known in the 2010 elections by sending a GOP majority to the U.S. House.\par \par \uc2 Before the \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2  ruling, House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said that the House would repeal the Affordable Care Act if the high court allowed it to stand.\par \par \uc2 However . before any such action is taken, we would counsel members of Congress to do what apparently relatively few have done: Read the bill. Find out what's in it -- good and bad -- before attempting to scrap it.\par \par \uc2 Those same polls mentioned above establish that most Americans also find things to like in the act, including extension of coverage by their parents' plans to adult children up to age 26, and requirements for coverage of pre-existing conditions.\par \par \uc2 Polling also shows that most Americans favor Republican-backed provisions that are not to be found in the act as it was passed. These include allowing individuals to buy health care insurance across state lines, and expanded tort reform provisions, both of which will cut costs.\par \par \uc2 We'd like to believe that the \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2 's measured ruling contains an invitation for Congress and the executive branch to find common ground and move forward with a health care plan that is sensible, affordable, flexible and works for all Americans.\par \par \uc2 One thing Thursday's ruling did not change is the reality that some 30 million of our fellow Americans go without health care and that the costs of this are borne by taxpayers and by those who do have the relative luxury of health care insurance.\par \par \uc2 The third branch of government has done its work on this issue with wisdom and integrity. It is left to the other two branches to show they can follow suit.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 The Dallas Morning News. June 29, 2012.\par \par \uc2 Health care ruling an ironic win for Obama\par \par \uc2 The question, as it happens, wasn't whether the commerce clause gave Congress the constitutional power to mandate that Americans purchase health insurance.\par \par \uc2 This clause was the focus of heated debate for months as the fundamental premise to the 2010 Affordable Care Act, the centerpiece of President Barack Obama's domestic agenda.\par \par \uc2 For naught, apparently. A 5-4 \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2  majority said Thursday that the health care law's insurance requirement was a tax, not a mandate of commerce, placing it within Congress' legal authority. This was among the ironies to emerge from the nuanced, restrained decision.\par \par \uc2 The expected swing vote was to have been Justice \uc2 Anthony Kennedy\uc2 , but he sided with conservatives \uc2 Antonin Scalia\uc2 , \uc2 Clarence Thomas\uc2  and \uc2 Samuel Alito\uc2  in voting to toss the entire law, in part on the commerce clause point.\par \par \uc2 Instead, the majority maker was Chief Justice \uc2 John Roberts\uc2 , a George W. Bush appointee who wrote the most consequential decision of his tenure. Roberts joined liberals Ruth Ginsburg, \uc2 Stephen Breyer\uc2 , Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan in preserving the mandate -- and, therefore, almost the entire law -- and handing Obama a decisive victory during a difficult month for his re-election campaign.\par \par \uc2 The bill barely made it out of Congress and to Obama's pen, with no Republican votes. While this newspaper agreed with many of its provisions, including the goal of universal coverage, we disagreed with the massive document as written, mainly because of its sketchy funding and failure to contain future costs.\par \par \uc2 That said, we had no issue with the individual mandate. Without a way to bring more people under private coverage, premiums would skyrocket in the move to universal coverage. An individual mandate was the least intrusive and most personally responsible means to that end.\par \par \uc2 So it was unexpected that Roberts would helpfully rewrite the law for congressional Democrats and Obama, who insisted the mandate was not a tax. The administration did not adopt the tax argument until the case reached the courts, and then only in part.\par \par \uc2 All along, Republicans bemoaned another tax increase; ultimately, the court agreed -- to the GOP's detriment. Accordingly, concerns about another divisive 5-4 decision seem to have melted away, at least among those most concerned.\par \par \uc2 Texas was among 26 states that joined the \uc2 National Federation of Independent Business\uc2  and others in challenging the law's constitutionality. Roberts' opinion did soften the penalty against states that opt out of new Medicaid requirements, but Texas would not be wise to take that path.\par \par \uc2 Unfortunately, the fight to repeal the law will only gain shrill momentum now. House Republicans already have scheduled a doomed vote to overturn it, and Mitt Romney, Obama's GOP challenger, continues to promise repeal. In polls, Americans still oppose the law, despite favoring some of its planks.\par \par \uc2 A wiser course would be to accept the court's ruling and improve the parts of the law involving funding and cost containment. But that would require real leadership, another irony.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Tyler Morning Telegraph. June 29, 2012.\par \par \uc2 Obamacare is now law of the land\par \par \uc2 Obamacare Is Now Law Of The Land\par \par \uc2 So the \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2  didn't swoop down, deus ex machina, to save us from the Affordable Care Act. That means it's up to us. If we oppose the law, we're going to have to rely upon good old politics -- campaigns and voter registration drives and elections -- to change it.\par \par \uc2 And that's how it should be. As President Barack Obama reportedly said, elections do have consequences. The GOP's anemic efforts in 2008 led directly to Obamacare. If Republican leaders want to dismantle the law, they'll have to make a stronger showing in November.\par \par \uc2 And they won't be able to do so merely by campaigning against the current law. They'll have to present a better alternative. They'll have to make the case that their plan will be superior to Obama's largely untested reforms.\par \par \uc2 In hindsight, this is actually a better outcome than if the individual mandate had been struck down, and the rest of the law upheld (which is the outcome many were expecting). Why? Because without the individual mandate, the rest of the law can't work -- not without substantial hikes in insurance premiums. To support the additional burden on insurance pools (particularly stemming from inclusion of pre-existing conditions), lots of healthy people have to start paying monthly premiums. The individual mandate is the only way to force them to do so.\par \par \uc2 In the meantime, Texas leaders must accept the defeat and start the process of establishing those insurance exchanges. Of course, the Legislature won't convene until after the November elections, but setting up the exchange is a big job and state agencies need to get to work now.\par \par \uc2 One note about broccoli -- the vegetable loomed large in the \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2 's decision on Thursday.\par \par \uc2 "According to the Government, upholding the individual mandate would not justify mandatory purchases of items such as cars or broccoli because, as the Government puts it, `health insurance is not purchased for its own sake like a car or broccoli; it is a means of financing health-care consumption and covering universal risks'." the majority opinion reads. "But cars and broccoli are no more purchased for their `own sake' than health insurance. They are purchased to cover the need for transportation and food."\par \par \uc2 Even the dissenting justices wrote, "Those differences make a very good argument by the dissent's own lights, since they show that the failure to purchase health insurance, unlike the failure to purchase cars or broccoli, creates a national, social-welfare problem that is (in the dissent's view) included among the unenumerated `problems' that the Constitution authorizes the Federal Government to solve."\par \par \uc2 Broccoli is important, because it's a good example of what lengths the government can go to in order to fix us.\par \par \uc2 By upholding the individual mandate, the \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2  has affirmed a disturbing precedent: government can require much more of us, in the name of our own good, than many of us believed.\par \par \uc2 In all likelihood, that's going to become very apparent, very soon. One of the biggest problems with our health care system isn't the system, as much as it is our health. We make bad choices. Many Americans eat too much. Many smoke. Many engage in high-risk behaviors.\par \par \uc2 The ACA decision gives government the green light to "help" us make better choices. Watch for new laws, new regulations and new penalties for things we might enjoy -- but might not be good for us.\par \par \uc2 The voting public may rise up in November and elect politicians who oppose Obamacare.\par \par \uc2 But until then, the Affordable Care Act is the law of the land.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 San Antonio Express-News. June 27, 2012.\par \par \uc2 Congress must act on border issues\par \par \uc2 Both sides in the immigration debate can claim some measure of victory in last week's U.S. Supreme Court decision on Arizona's immigration enforcement law. In split decisions, the high court struck down three controversial provisions of the law requiring immigrants to obtain and carry registration papers, making it a criminal offense for an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  to seek employment and allowing police to arrest suspected illegal immigrants without a warrant.\par \par \uc2 In a unanimous decision, however, the justices let stand for now a key feature of the Arizona statute -- a provision requiring police to question the immigration status of people stopped for other matters if a reasonable suspicion exists they are in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 The "show-us-your-papers" provision, as critics refer to it, may be constitutional. But as a matter of public policy, it certainly isn't wise. It will likely lead to declining cooperation between immigrant communities and law enforcement officers. A victim of domestic violence, for instance, will be far less inclined to report abuse if calling the police necessarily entails a review of the immigration status of even extended family members.\par \par \uc2 Like President Barack Obama's decision last week to halt the deportation of young illegal immigrants who were brought to the United States as children, the Arizona immigration statute is an imperfect solution to a complex problem. In striking down three of the Arizona law's provisions, the high court reaffirmed the federal government's constitutional prerogative and obligation to enact and enforce immigration policy.\par \par \uc2 The failure of the federal government to act has encouraged Arizona and other states to step into the breach, creating a patchwork of flawed immigration laws. If the \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2  decision provides clarity on any issue, it is on the need for Congress to finally pass a set of comprehensive immigration reforms that address the economic and geographic realities of the Unites States in the 21st century.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 The Brownsville Herald. June 27, 2012.\par \par \uc2 Court nullifies some, keeps some parts of Arizona immigration law\par \par \uc2 We welcome the \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2 's ruling on Arizona's controversial immigration law. We hope it helps ensure fair treatment of all U.S. residents in all states, including those that enacted similar laws ostensibly to address Congress' inability, or unwillingness, to reach accord on immigration policy.\par \par \uc2 "Arizona may have understandable frustrations with the problems caused by illegal immigration while that process continues, but the state may not pursue policies that undermine federal law," Associate Justice \uc2 Anthony Kennedy\uc2  wrote in the court's majority opinion last week. President Obama issued a reaction that echoed the court's opinion: "A patchwork of state laws is not a solution to our broken immigration system -- it is part of the problem," Obama stated in his written response.\par \par \uc2 The high court didn't invalidate Arizona's law outright, but it did throw out some provisions. The court negated the requirement that immigrants always carry proof of legal residency, and authorization for local law enforcement officials to arrest suspected illegal immigrants without a warrant. It also threw out the provision that makes it a state offense to live or seek work without legal residency status.\par \par \uc2 While the justices split on most of the provisions, they unanimously upheld the constitutionality of the item that has drawn the most opposition -- the requirement that local law enforcement officers check the immigration status of every person they contact, as long as it isn't the primary reason for that contact. The court made it clear, though, that no person can be detained for an unreasonable length of time solely to determine residency status.\par \par \uc2 Thus, while states can't enact or enforce laws regarding immigration status -- which obviously is a federal issue -- they can run checks on the residency of people they stop for other reasons, as long as they don't detain them unreasonably while those checks are made.\par \par \uc2 In fact, the opinion noted that consultation between local and federal authorities is an important part of law enforcement, including the enforcement of immigration law. "Detaining individuals solely to verify their immigration status would raise constitutional concerns," Kennedy's opinion stated.\par \par \uc2 Under ideal conditions, this should not pose a problem. People suspected of robbery, assault or even running a red light can be subject to a thorough criminal background check. Since the 9/11 attacks, people have also recognized the need for complete, accurate databases, and immigration status can be one of the many databases authorities can access. Many cases, however, have revealed that those databases aren't always current and accessible to local officials.\par \par \uc2 Since Arizona's immigration law was the first of its kind, there is no structure for state law enforcement officials to deal with people who are detained for possible violation of federal immigration law. Until Congress establishes standards for such cases, states' application of their respective laws must be monitored to ensure that basic human rights aren't ignored because of a person's immigration status.\par \par \uc2 Last week's ruling helps set parameters for immigration law with regard to what local authorities can and can't do with regard to this federal issue. Clearly it is something Congress must address; if it already had done so, states might not have thought it necessary to take federal law into their own hands.\par \par \uc2 Let's hope Congress members finally get the message.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120703e873001pj\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Scottsbluff Star Herald. June 29, 2012.\par \par \uc2 Immigration\par \par \uc2 The U.S. Supreme Court's decision on Arizona's controversial immigration law makes it clear that U.S. citizens have the right to be free of being hassled or harassed because of their name, skin color or heritage. While illegal immigration is a problem, compelling police to assume that every Hispanic person they encounter is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  is the wrong way to deal with it. A "solution" that leaves legal citizens feeling fearful and oppressed is no solution at all.\par \par \uc2 Those who see the decision as a political loss should take comfort in the clear message from the court that the federal government is in charge of immigration policy. It's time politicians quit treating it as a wedge issue and looked for components of a solution that they can agree on.\par \par \uc2 It would be helpful if both parties took a stand to affirm that immigrants include people from all over the world. They're not defined by skin color, language or their names. Not all people with brown faces are immigrants. Not all immigrants arrived here illegally. The aim of immigration policy isn't ethnic cleansing or making life uncomfortable for families who have been Americans for generations.\par \par \uc2 Accord on reforms could start with agreement that the nation needs to secure its borders, not just to stop illegal immigration, but to keep out terrorists. That has nothing to do with bigotry and would focus on the need for national security.\par \par \uc2 Sending illegal immigrants back to their native countries to wait their turn would work if immigration policy made it practical. It isn't, because of antiquated and illogical immigration laws. For many, there's no line to stand in, because of the lack of a coherent, efficient system that would guarantee them the opportunity to keep their jobs and support their families in the interim.\par \par \uc2 For that reason, and others, those who call for mass deportation are dreaming. It would be costly, impractical and a humanitarian nightmare to attempt to uproot millions of people and send them to other countries where they might lack any means of caring for themselves. It would require breaking up families and deporting children who are American citizens under the provisions of the 14th Amendment. There are battalions of lawyers out there who would be more than willing to take on immigration cases and hand the bill to the taxpayers.\par \par \uc2 A better solution would be to recognize that most immigrants come to the U.S. to find work, and that the people who hire them are contributing to the problem, as well as exploiting vulnerable people. Requiring employers to confirm identification and work eligibility and creating penalties for hiring under-the-table labor would go a long way toward making it pointless to enter the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 Another could be establishing a way for people living in this country illegally to come clean and make it right. Serving in the military or other public service, such as fighting fires, would be an example. Establishing a means for people with family or property who agree to pay fines and fill out the proper paperwork to establish legal residency would be another. Obtaining sponsorship from an employer in an industry that needs workers, such as meatpacking, might be another. Reserve deportation for those who refuse.\par \par \uc2 Of course, it's not up to the courts or editorial writers to come up with a federal immigration policy. And, as the court ruled, it's not up to lawmakers in 50 different states. That's the job of Congress. If you're looking for someone to blame for the immigration mess, that's the place to start.\par \par \uc2 The Obama administration showed plenty of energy in its fight to block the Arizona law. It should be equally motivated to start enforcing present immigration laws and work toward needed reforms, which must include making sure that immigrants, legal or not, don't exploit welfare programs paid for by taxpayers. It's time for Congress to show the kind of courage it will take to do what's right for the nation, even if it isn't universally popular.\par \par \uc2 --------\par \par \uc2 Omaha World-Herald. June 29, 2012.\par \par \uc2 Move ahead on health care\par \par \uc2 The Supreme Court has spoken. The national health care law was found constitutional.\par \par \uc2 Americans will disagree about the best course ahead. Many will say, stick with the national health care law. Others will say, scrap it and adopt something else.\par \par \uc2 The presidential and congressional elections provide a good opportunity to hold that spirited debate.\par \par \uc2 But the vote in November needs to channel that debate toward a solution. Voters need to send a signal about the general direction they want to go.\par \par \uc2 Then we need to move forward. We can't have a stalemate on tackling health care. Our country needs to move ahead with a clear national strategy.\par \par \uc2 No one, regardless of political philosophy, can dispute that our health care system is headed in the wrong direction in important ways.\par \par \uc2 Medical inflation remains untamed and poses a major long-term worry. The percentage of Americans lacking health insurance has been on the rise for years. Hospital emergency rooms, already heavily burdened, serve as de facto clinics for poor people lacking health coverage. Insurance premiums continue to rise for businesses, the self-employed and government. Medicaid costs for the federal and state governments continue on a strong upward trend.\par \par \uc2 It's a huge, complex problem, and it's beyond the ability of the state governments alone to solve. That makes a federal approach, in some form, both necessary and appropriate.\par \par \uc2 In a new Washington Post-ABC News poll, most respondents (56 percent) said they're unhappy with the nation's current health care system, though most (52 percent) also said they look on the national health care law unfavorably.\par \par \uc2 Public support for certain steps is already clear. Some examples: Covering preventive care, such as immunizations and screenings, without requiring patients to pay a co-payment. Covering adult children up to age 26 through a parent's insurance plan. And offering a simplified process for patients to appeal when claims are denied.\par \par \uc2 Because public support for such steps was so strong, three major insurers, \uc2 UnitedHealth Group\uc2 , \uc2 Humana\uc2  and \uc2 Aetna\uc2 , had already said before the court ruling that they would keep those parts of the health care law, having factored the costs into premiums.\par \par \uc2 Consumers also have a role to play. The solution lies with all of us -- and should. Consumers must be willing and able to include costs among the factors in their health care decisions.\par \par \uc2 With the court ruling now settled and the presidential election to be decided this fall, we soon will have the opportunity to settle on a way forward. Stalemate must not be an option.\par \par \uc2 We have a national responsibility to step beyond partisan argument over health care and take strong action.\par \par \uc2 --------\par \par \uc2 McCook Daily Gazette. June 29, 2012.\par \par \uc2 Court decision shifts question to appropriate place\par \par \uc2 Sen. Ben Nelson has good reason to feel vindicated in taking the stance that probably cost him his Senate seat, his insistence that states not be saddled with exploding Medicaid costs, a position that came to be called the "Cornhusker Kickback."\par \par \uc2 While it came across as a special exception for Nebraska in exchange for the deciding vote on Obamacare, Nelson has maintained he was opposed to the law's threat to withhold all of states' Medicaid funding if they fail to expand the program along federal guidelines.\par \par \uc2 The Supreme Court agrees, as it turns out, striking that provision as unduly coercive.\par \par \uc2 "Sometimes, the irony of all ironies occurs," Nelson told The Associated Press.\par \par \uc2 In another irony, the fact that the individual mandate was a tax -- something the administration insisted it was not, while it was trying to get health care reform through Congress -- was what saved Obamacare from the shredder.\par \par \uc2 The Supreme Court didn't buy the argument that the Commerce Clause of the Constitution permitted the government to mandate health care insurance. However, Bush appointee Chief Justice John G. Roberts did buy the administration's Plan B argument, that the government did have the right to tax those who decided not to buy health insurance.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, money has been pouring into the Romney campaign since the ruling, and Gov. Dave Heineman is vowing to fight expansion of Medicaid, saying it would rob funding from education or force taxes to increase.\par \par \uc2 Thursday's ruling was also a reaffirmation of the high court's role as an interpreter of the laws, despite Nelson's repeated co-opting of Republican cries of judicial activism, not a body to pass judgment on the wisdom of the health care law.\par \par \uc2 "Those decisions are entrusted to our nation's elected leaders, who can be thrown out of office if the people disagree with them," Roberts wrote. "It is not our job to protect the people from the consequences of their political choices."\par \par \uc2 The system worked as it should, shifting the question of expanded health care back to the executive and legislative branches, and ultimately to the people who are in the end responsible for their own health care, the citizens themselves.\par \par \uc2 Will they trash the whole program, including popular provisions like keeping children on parents' policies until age 26 and ending lifetime benefit limits and denial of insurance for pre-existing conditions? Will they throw out the leaders responsible for Obamacare as well?\par \par \uc2 Will they elect leaders who vow to repeal the health care act, will those leaders be able to repeal the act, and with what will they replace it?\par \par \uc2 Only the voters can shape those answers, and that is how it should be.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Lincoln Journal Star. June 27, 2012.\par \par \uc2 Wildlife, land at greater risk\par \par \uc2 Smoke often smudged the horizon in farm country this spring as farmers burned prairie grass in preparation for growing corn, soybeans, wheat and other crops on land that had been in the Conservation Reserve Program.\par \par \uc2 In Nebraska alone, the program known as the most successful conservation program in history will decline by another 100,000 acres this year, federal officials announced this month.\par \par \uc2 The trend should concern those who want to protect wildlife habitat, control erosion and maintain the quality of streams and rivers.\par \par \uc2 Since 2007, the amount of CRP land in Nebraska has dropped from 1.34 million acres to 900,000. "The rate at which native grassland, particularly in our nation's prairies, is being converted rivals any in recent history," Paul Schmidt of Ducks Unlimited said in a prepared statement.\par \par \uc2 High prices for grain mean that land that had been considered marginal now could be farmed profitably. As Greg Reisdorf of the \uc2 Farm Service Agency\uc2  put it, "If you're a businessman, you do what's right for your operation."\par \par \uc2 While most think it's inevitable that some land now in the CRP program be returned to crop production, it's important that government policy be designed to give farmers incentives to protect the most fragile acres.\par \par \uc2 It's encouraging, for example, that the Senate version of the new farm bill includes a "sodsaver" provision that was supported by both Sens. Mike Johanns and Ben Nelson.\par \par \uc2 The provision reduces the subsidy on native grassland that is plowed so crops can be grown.\par \par \uc2 The provision also appears to have support in the House, which is working on its own version of the farm bill.\par \par \uc2 In part because of pressure to reduce government spending, the amount of acres in the CRP program will be reduced by 10 million acres in the Senate's farm bill. The number of acres in the Conservation Stewardship Program, which rewards best practices, will be reduced by 2 million.\par \par \uc2 For a time, it appeared that the Senate bill would subsidize crop insurance with no requirement that farmers participate in conservation programs. That requirement, however, was inserted late in the process.\par \par \uc2 Most observers think that pressure to reduce spending on the farm bill will be greater in the House.\par \par \uc2 The first place the House should look to cut spending would be in the Senate's proposed expanded subsidies for crop insurance. Any attempt to further cut conservation spending would be misguided.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120702e8720016g\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) - South Carolina's labor agency has a warning for businesses across the state: Check the legal status of your new employees through a free, online system or face immediate penalties starting Sunday.\par \par \uc2 The phase-in period for the state's anti-illegal-immigration requirements ends with the fiscal year. For businesses of all sizes, that means no more warning for a first violation.\par \par \uc2 The law requires businesses to use the federal online E-verify program to ensure their new hires are in the country legally or face punishments that start with probation and progress to a forced shutdown. Employees must be verified through the system within three business days of being hired.\par \par \uc2 "There is no free bite at the apple after July 1," said Jim Knight, who oversees immigration compliance for the Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation.\par \par \uc2 The employer requirements were part of a broad anti-illegal-immigration law approved last year. Among other things, it required law enforcement officers to try to check the legal status of someone they suspect is in the country illegally. While the criminal portions were challenged in federal court, the requirements on businesses remained intact.\par \par \uc2 Legislators had tacked on the business portion to tweak the state's 2008 immigration law, so South Carolina's rules on checking employees' status lined up with a U.S. Supreme Court decision last year.\par \par \uc2 That 2008 law had begun applying to businesses of all sizes in July 2010. But last year's changes reset the clock on enforcement. The changes included getting rid of the fining system and no longer allowing businesses to use a South Carolina driver's license as confirmation of legal status.\par \par \uc2 The agency has spent the last year re-educating business groups on the law. Knight said he's spoken at more than 200 meetings of chambers of commerce, trade associations and civic groups. And every employer received a mailing in September.\par \par \uc2 A director with the Home Builders Association of South Carolina said he's heard no complaints.\par \par \uc2 "The general philosophy going forward is if you're going to be in business, you'd better get used to using it. It protects you and is the way to go. Don't fight it," said Julian Barton with the group that represents 3,500 builders. "There's certainly no reason with the penalties to mess around."\par \par \uc2 The new law created a grace period between January and June, during which LLR would help businesses become compliant.\par \par \uc2 "Once they enroll in E-verify, they say it's easy," Knight said. "It only takes a second to check."\par \par \uc2 Between Jan. 1 and April 30, 92 percent of businesses randomly selected by a computer for an audit were following the law, Knight said.\par \par \uc2 Of the 130 employers caught not using E-verify, all were small businesses with generally a dozen or fewer workers, whose officials were simply uninformed, Knight said. No \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  workers were found, Knight said.\par \par \uc2 He attributes that to two things: the economic downturn and reports of the law itself that may have scared \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  workers into leaving.\par \par \uc2 Roberto Belen with the South Carolina Hispanic Leadership Council notes the required checks apply to those newly hired. He said that leaves workers who already hold low-skilled, high-stamina jobs to endure even worse conditions.\par \par \uc2 "They will take any abuse, any conditions to remain employed because they have no other choice," said Belen, a native of Puerto Rico who retired from the Air Force in 2007.\par \par \uc2 He believes the law's punishments will also cause businesses to discriminate against people with last names that sound remotely Hispanic, no matter what their status.\par \par \uc2 Businesses have to be "very, very careful if they're hiring someone not with a last name of Smith or Jones," he said. "If they have to choose between a Jones or Perez, they'll hire Jones. It creates a different class of society. That's not right."\par \par \uc2 Starting Sunday, a first violation brings a one-year probation, requiring the business to submit quarterly reports to the agency. If another violation occurs within three years, the business will be shut down for between 10 and 30 days through a temporary suspension of its operating licenses.\par \par \uc2 The punishment becomes more severe if the agency determines the employer knowingly hired an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 That brings an automatic suspension of 10 to 30 days on a first violation. The business can reopen only after proving the worker has been fired and paying a fee of up to $1,000. A second violation shuts down the business for 30 to 60 days. Additional offenses result in a permanent shutdown by revoking all business licenses.\par \par \uc2 If the shutdown threats weren't enough of an incentive, the law also uses shame as an enforcement tool.\par \par \uc2 A first offense, whether intentional or not, puts the business on the agency's Web site for six months. A second violation means the employer becomes permanently posted.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120630e86u0026o\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

'green light' on immigration; critics see roadblock\b0\par\par\uc2 By JOHN HANNA   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 723 \uc2 words\par \uc2 26 June 2012\par 11:01\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2012.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) - Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach said a U.S. Supreme Court ruling Monday on illegal immigration gives legislators in his home state a "green light" for a crackdown, but his fellow Republicans still aren't all behind him.\par \par \uc2 Kobach, a former law professor who's advised officials across the nation on get-tough policies on immigration, said he's pleased with the high court's ruling on an Arizona law he helped draft two years ago, even though the justices struck down three of the four provisions under attack. The justices kept in place a provision requiring police to check the immigration status of people stopped for other reasons if officers have a reasonable suspicion they're in the U.S. illegally.\par \par \uc2 Kobach called the "show me your papers" provision the "core" of the Arizona law and said Kansas legislators can pursue a similar measure. He also noted that the Supreme Court ruling didn't touch on issues that the state's lawmakers have discussed, such as requiring government contractors or other businesses to use the federal E-Verify database to check the status of new employees.\par \par \uc2 "If Kansas wanted to take the two strongest steps, which would be an E-Verify requirement for the whole state and an arrest requirement like Arizona's that we saw reviewed today, they have a green light to do so," Kobach told The Associated Press in an interview.\par \par \uc2 But Kobach's opponents in Kansas scoffed at his description of the high court ruling as a victory and said it's likely to hinder any effort to enact proposals favored by Kobach. They noted that while the court spared the provision directing police to check people's immigration status, the justices didn't preclude legal challenges later when the law is more fully interpreted by Arizona's courts.\par \par \uc2 "I don't see how under any interpretation you can say this is a green light," said Gary Brunk, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Kansas and Western Missouri, adding that states should move with "great caution" in considering "copycat laws."\par \par \uc2 Kobach was a University of Missouri-Kansas City law professor who advocated laws such as Arizona's for years before his successful run for secretary of state as a Republican in 2010. But his allies in the Kansas Legislature have been bedeviled by a split among GOP lawmakers and resistance from the business community.\par \par \uc2 This year, the powerful \uc2 Kansas Chamber of Commerce\uc2 , a key constituency for conservative Republicans, joined an unsuccessful push for a state program to place some illegal immigrants in jobs if the state declares that an industry has a labor shortage. It has the backing of agriculture groups, but Kobach described it as an amnesty proposal.\par \par \uc2 Allie Devine, a Topeka attorney and former state agriculture secretary who lobbies for business owners on immigration policy, noted that the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling recognized that the federal government has broad discretion in deciding which illegal immigrants to deport -- suggesting to her the law would allow such a jobs program in Kansas.\par \par \uc2 Also, the Legislature is likely to have plenty of new members next year. All 40 state Senate and 125 state House seats are on the ballot in November, and new political boundaries set earlier this month by three federal judges are likely to result in significant turnover.\par \par \uc2 "The biggest change that we'll have is dependent upon the outcome of the elections and the direction the new Legislature wants to send Kansas," Devine said.\par \par \uc2 But House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lance Kinzer, a conservative Olathe Republican and a Kobach ally, said he expects to continue the push next year for initiatives like a "show me your papers" law and an E-Verify requirement for businesses, though he hasn't settled on the details of a package.\par \par \uc2 He noted that provisions of the Arizona law struck down by the high court, such as one making it a crime for an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  to seek work, haven't been considered seriously in Kansas.\par \par \uc2 "The last couple of rounds of court opinions haven't really changed the debate," Kinzer said.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Follow John Hanna on Twitter at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.twitter.com/apjdhanna"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.twitter.com/apjdhanna}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120626e86q001on\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHILADELPHIA (AP) - An attempted crackdown on illegal immigrants in Pennsylvania remains in legal limbo after Monday's \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2  ruling in a similar case, and parties on both sides claim the high court's decision bolsters their respective positions.\par \par \uc2 The Illegal Immigration Relief Act in Hazleton, Pa., has not been enforced since its passage in 2006 because of court challenges. A federal appeals court in Philadelphia is scheduled to hear oral arguments on Aug. 15.\par \par \uc2 Hazleton's ordinance sought to fine landlords who rent to illegal immigrants and deny business permits to companies that employ them. A companion measure required prospective tenants to register with City Hall and pay for a rental permit.\par \par \uc2 On Monday, the \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2  struck down part of an Arizona law that would have required all immigrants to obtain or carry immigration registration papers, along with a provision making it a state criminal offense for an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  to seek work or hold a job.\par \par \uc2 Opponents of the Hazleton regulations "are in a stronger position today as a result of this \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2  decision," said Omar Jadwat, an attorney with the \uc2 American Civil Liberties Union\uc2  who has worked on the Pennsylvania case.\par \par \uc2 The Hazleton laws -- emulated by cities around the nation -- were struck down by a federal judge. The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia later affirmed the decision, saying the ordinances usurped the federal government's exclusive power to regulate immigration.\par \par \uc2 But on Monday, the high court upheld an element of the Arizona law allowing police to check the status of someone they suspect is not in the United States legally.\par \par \uc2 That decision shows states "do play an integral part in combating illegal immigration," said U.S. Rep. Lou Barletta, R-Pa.\par \par \uc2 "(T)housands of properly trained law enforcement officers in Arizona can help the federal government enforce immigration law," he said in a statement.\par \par \uc2 Barletta had championed the Hazleton laws as mayor of the northeastern Pennsylvania city after two illegal immigrants were charged in a fatal shooting. He argued that a growing population of illegal immigrants in the community of about 25,000 increased crime and overwhelmed police, schools and hospitals.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2  recently ordered the Philadelphia appellate judges to reconsider their Hazleton decision following the justices' ruling on a different Arizona law. In May 2011, the high court affirmed employer sanctions for hiring workers who are in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 Another issue the appeals court must consider in August is whether the Hazleton crackdown would violate federal due process rights, Jadwat said.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Follow Kathy Matheson at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.twitter.com/kmatheson"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.twitter.com/kmatheson}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120625e86p00301\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) - Monday's \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2  ruling overturning key provisions of Arizona's illegal-immigration law opens the door for courts to strike down similar measures in states that have tried to make it a crime for illegal immigrants to live and work in the U.S.\par \par \uc2 Supporters of immigration crackdowns, however, say the ruling also gives states a critical role in enforcing federal law by allowing local authorities to check the immigration status of those suspected of being in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 "I'm encouraged at least by that glimmer of hope in the decision that we'll have the opportunity to interact more closely with the federal government on undocumented residents when we encounter them," said South Carolina state Sen. Larry Martin, a Republican who sponsored his state's legislation. "Beyond that, I think our hands are tied by the federal law."\par \par \uc2 The high court struck down Arizona's requirement that all immigrants obtain or carry immigration registration papers; a provision making it a crime for an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  to seek or hold a job; and a provision allowing police to arrest suspected illegal immigrants without warrants.\par \par \uc2 In the majority opinion written by Justice Anthony Kennedy, the court ruled that those provisions conflicted with federal law. In other words, enforcing the nation's immigration laws is a task for the federal government, not state or local governments.\par \par \uc2 Laws passed in Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, Indiana and Utah were modeled at least in part upon the one passed by Arizona in 2010. Now that the \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2  has weighed in on the issue, challenges to the laws in those states can now likely move forward.\par \par \uc2 Parts of those laws had been temporarily blocked. Federal judges in many cases had been waiting to issue a final ruling until the \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2  made its decision, believing the high court ruling would set important legal precedent.\par \par \uc2 Both supporters and detractors of the crackdowns describe Alabama's law as the toughest in the nation. It adopted much of the Arizona law and incorporated other provisions, including a requirement that public schools verify the citizenship status of new students.\par \par \uc2 Also, Alabama is the only state where courts allowed a provision to go into effect that requires officers to make a "reasonable attempt" during any traffic stop or other police encounter to determine the immigration status of a person if there is suspicion of someone being an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The high court ruling clears the way for the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to decide whether those provisions can stand. The 11th Circuit is also considering Georgia's law, which contains provisions allowing police to check people's immigration status.\par \par \uc2 For Georgia to avoid having that law overturned based on arguments that such checks amount to racial profiling, officers would have to investigate the immigration status of every person they detain, said Charles Kuck, an Atlanta immigration attorney and former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. He said it was a mistake for supporters of the law to interpret the high court's ruling as a victory.\par \par \uc2 "This is a massive defeat for those who believe states can regulate immigration," Kuck said. "I think it's funny that anybody could read that decision and come to any other conclusion."\par \par \uc2 The ruling also could clear the way for a federal court to make permanent an injunction that struck down a provision in Indiana's law that went even further than Arizona's law. That provision allowed police to arrest anyone who had been ordered by federal authorities to be detained or deported -- even if those people were not suspected of any other crime. Groups including the \uc2 American Civil Liberties Union\uc2  had argued that provision gave police unprecedented arrest powers.\par \par \uc2 "If nothing else, (the high court ruling) just reinforces the unconstitutionality of the Indiana law," said Ken Falk, legal director of the ACLU of Indiana.\par \par \uc2 In Utah, Attorney General Mark Shurtleff called the \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2  ruling a win, saying his state's law differed significantly from Arizona's. Utah's law requires people arrested for serious crimes to prove their citizenship, though police can use their discretion for people arrested for lesser crimes.\par \par \uc2 Lawsuits over Utah's law are still pending in federal court, and Shurtleff acknowledged "there's going to be ongoing litigation, civil rights lawsuits, people living in fear."\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2  left untouched one complaint raised in numerous lawsuits: that immigration crackdown laws encourage police to engage in racial profiling. That leaves open the possibility that, based on those arguments, lower courts could still overturn parts of various laws.\par \par \uc2 Other states including Mississippi, Nebraska and Oklahoma had previously considered immigration crackdowns that ultimately failed. It's possible the \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2  ruling will deter other states from considering their own laws in the future, or at least discourage them from including provisions similar to those struck down.\par \par \uc2 "I don't think this is a total victory for our side by any stretch of the imagination," said Mary Bauer, legal director of the Montgomery-based Southern Poverty Law Center, which is challenging Alabama's law. "But I think it's a blow to other states that would think about going down this road."\par \par \uc2 Nebraska state Sen. Charlie Janssen, who sponsored a bill modeled after Arizona's last year, said he was encouraged that the \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2  at least upheld the one key provision allowing local authorities to check the immigration status of those suspected of being in the country illegally. But he said he wasn't sure if he would try to resurrect another immigration proposal.\par \par \uc2 "I certainly wouldn't bring something back that the U.S. Supreme Court just shot down," Janssen said.\par \par \uc2 In Oklahoma, one state lawmaker vowed to resurrect a proposal cracking down on illegal immigration. Last year, Sen. Ralph Shortey sponsored legislation that would have allowed police to confiscate property belonging to illegal immigrants. The Oklahoma City Republican said he would "absolutely" resurrect that proposal, adding that the \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2  ruling -- in his view -- says states can enforce immigration laws.\par \par \uc2 "That's all that we've asked, just let us (states) handle the problem on our own," he said.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 AP reporters Meg Kinnard in Columbia, S.C., Charles Wilson in Indianapolis, Ken Miller in Oklahoma City, Dorie Turner in Atlanta, Grant Schulte in Lincoln, Neb., and Brian Skoloff and Paul Foy in Salt Lake City contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120625e86p002v0\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

'green light' on immigration; critics see roadblock\b0\par\par\uc2 By JOHN HANNA   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 722 \uc2 words\par \uc2 25 June 2012\par 17:15\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2012.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) - Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach said a U.S. Supreme Court ruling Monday on illegal immigration gives legislators in his home state a "green light" for a crackdown, but his fellow Republicans still aren't all behind him.\par \par \uc2 Kobach, a former law professor who's advised officials across the nation on get-tough policies on immigration, said he's pleased with the high court's ruling on an Arizona law he helped draft two years ago, even though the justices struck down three of the four provisions under attack. The justices kept in place a provision requiring police to check the immigration status of people stopped for other reasons if officers have a reasonable suspicion they're in the U.S. illegally.\par \par \uc2 Kobach called the "show me your papers" provision the "core" of the Arizona law and said Kansas legislators can pursue a similar measure. He also noted that the Supreme Court ruling didn't touch on issues that the state's lawmakers have discussed, such as requiring government contractors or other businesses to use the federal E-Verify database to check the status of new employees.\par \par \uc2 "If Kansas wanted to take the two strongest steps, which would be an E-Verify requirement for the whole state and an arrest requirement like Arizona's that we saw reviewed today, they have a green light to do so," Kobach told The Associated Press in an interview.\par \par \uc2 But Kobach's opponents in Kansas scoffed at his description of the high court ruling as a victory and said it's likely to hinder any effort to enact proposals favored by Kobach. They noted that while the court spared the provision directing police to check people's immigration status, the justices didn't preclude legal challenges later when the law is more fully interpreted by Arizona's courts.\par \par \uc2 "I don't see how under any interpretation you can say this is a green light," said Gary Brunk, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Kansas and Western Missouri, adding that states should move with "great caution" in considering "copycat laws."\par \par \uc2 Kobach was a University of Missouri-Kansas City law professor who advocated laws such as Arizona's for years before his successful run for secretary of state as a Republican in 2010. But his allies in the Kansas Legislature have been bedeviled by a split among GOP lawmakers and resistance from the business community.\par \par \uc2 This year, the powerful \uc2 Kansas Chamber of Commerce\uc2 , a key constituency for conservative Republicans, joined an unsuccessful push for a state program to place some illegal immigrants in jobs if the state declares that an industry has a labor shortage. It has the backing of agriculture groups, but Kobach described it as an amnesty proposal.\par \par \uc2 Allie Devine, a Topeka attorney and former state agriculture secretary who lobbies for business owners on immigration policy, noted that the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling recognized that the federal government has broad discretion in deciding which illegal immigrants to deport -- suggesting to her the law would allow such a jobs program in Kansas.\par \par \uc2 Also, the Legislature is likely to have plenty of new members next year. All 40 state Senate and 125 state House seats are on the ballot in November, and new political boundaries set earlier this month by three federal judges are likely to result in significant turnover.\par \par \uc2 "The biggest change that we'll have is dependent upon the outcome of the elections and the direction the new Legislature wants to send Kansas," Devine said.\par \par \uc2 But House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lance Kinzer, a conservative Olathe Republican and a Kobach ally, said he expects to continue the push next year for initiatives like a "show me your papers" law and an E-Verify requirement for businesses, though he hasn't settled on the details of a package.\par \par \uc2 He noted that provisions of the Arizona law struck down by the high court, such as one making it a crime for an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  to seek work, haven't been considered seriously in Kansas.\par \par \uc2 "The last couple of rounds of court opinions haven't really changed the debate," Kinzer said.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Follow John Hanna on Twitter at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.twitter.com/apjdhanna"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 www.twitter.com/apjdhanna}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120625e86p002tn\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) - The U.S. Supreme Court ruling on Arizona's immigration law was met Monday with mixed reactions in Nevada, underscoring how the politically charged issue will remain a key campaign topic heading into the November election.\par \par \uc2 While Democrats mostly hailed the court's decision that struck down three components of the law, they focused concern over one provision left intact that requires police to check the immigration status of those they stop for other reasons.\par \par \uc2 The court struck down provisions requiring all immigrants to obtain or carry immigration registration papers; making it a state criminal offense for an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  to seek work or hold a job; and allowing police to arrest suspected illegal immigrants without warrants.\par \par \uc2 Republican Gov. Brian Sandoval, who supported Arizona's right to enact its own immigration laws but said a similar law isn't needed in Nevada, said the high court's decision "makes it clear that the president and Congress must come together to reform our immigration status."\par \par \uc2 That sentiment was expressed by Republicans and Democrats alike.\par \par \uc2 "This is a strong reminder that ultimately, the responsibility of fixing our nation's broken immigration system lies with Congress," said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev.\par \par \uc2 In prepared remarks read on the Senate floor, Reid called the Arizona law "mean spirited" and said the court correctly struck down the bulk of the law.\par \par \uc2 But he and others said a fourth provision, the "show me your papers" provision requiring police to check the status of someone they suspect is not in the United States legally -- could lead to racial profiling.\par \par \uc2 "As long as this provision remains, innocent American citizens are in danger of being detained by police unless they carry immigration papers with them at all times," said Reid, who supports the DREAM Act that has languished in Congress. It would create a pathway to citizenship for some children of illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Rep. Shelley Berkley, D-Nev., locked in a tough U.S. Senate campaign against Republican Sen. Dean Heller, said Monday's ruling that upholds allowing officers to check a person's immigration status "will force even more people into the shadows."\par \par \uc2 Nevada's Latino community, now 25 percent of the state's electorate, will play a crucial role in the fall elections.\par \par \uc2 Heller has said he doesn't support the DREAM Act and has struggled to connect with Latino groups in southern Nevada. Heller did not comment Monday on the Supreme Court ruling, but his spokesman, Stewart Bybee, issued a statement when contacted by The Associated Press.\par \par \uc2 "States are frustrated with the federal government's reluctance to enforce existing laws," Bybee said. "Enforcing the laws and improving the processing of immigration applications would go a long way toward fixing the current immigration system and keeping states from acting on their own."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120625e86p002sq\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 INDIANAPOLIS (AP) - Two lawyers who challenged Indiana's immigration law said the U.S. Supreme Court's decision Monday to throw out part of a similar law in Arizona reinforces a federal judge's decision to block the Indiana statute.\par \par \uc2 "If nothing else, it just reinforces the unconstitutionality of the Indiana law," said Ken Falk, legal director of American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana.\par \par \uc2 Last year, U.S. District Judge Sarah Evans Barker issued an order preventing part of the 2011 Indiana law that gave local police power to arrest anyone who has had certain actions filed against them by immigration authorities.\par \par \uc2 On Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down provisions of Arizona's law that required all immigrants to obtain or carry immigration registration papers; made it a state criminal offense for an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  to seek work or hold a job; and allowed police to arrest suspected illegal immigrants without warrants.\par \par \uc2 But the court did not throw out the provision requiring police to check the immigration status of someone they suspect is not in the United States legally. Even there, though, the justices said the provision could be subject to additional legal challenges.\par \par \uc2 Indiana Attorney General Greg Zoeller said he would review the court's decision and advise lawmakers of any changes required in the statute.\par \par \uc2 Falk said the Arizona law required police to suspect an immigrant had committed a crime before making an arrest, while Indiana's law allowed police to arrest people who hadn't committed a crime. He said the Indiana law was "a clear violation of the Fourth Amendment."\par \par \uc2 "The reasoning of the Court's decision strongly supports the Indiana district court's injunction of two provisions of Indiana's law," said Linton Joaquin, general counsel with National Immigration Law Center, which helped the ACLU represent the three immigrants who filed the lndiana lawsuit.\par \par \uc2 Barker last year threw out a provision of the Indiana law that would allow the arrest of anyone who has had a notice of action filed by immigration authorities, a formal paperwork step that affects virtually anyone applying to be in the U.S. for any reason. The other portion of the law that was blocked would have made it illegal for immigrants to use ID cards issued by foreign consulates as proof of identification.\par \par \uc2 "As a whole, the decision appears to reinforce the proposition that immigration is the sole province of the federal government and states do not have a role," Falk said.\par \par \uc2 The Indiana state government, which is fighting to have the temporary injunction lifted claims that police could only arrest immigrants when they have documents that show the federal government has ordered them to be removed or detained.\par \par \uc2 A Mexican cultural group in East Chicago also challenged the state law in northern Indiana federal court in December, but the judge there stayed the proceedings pending the Supreme Court's decision in the Arizona case.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120625e86p002g9\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) - Mitt Romney on Monday said the Supreme Court should have given states "more latitude" to deal with immigration than the justices allowed when they struck down key parts of Arizona's tough immigration enforcement law.\par \par \uc2 The likely Republican nominee declined to address the specifics of the court's decision to uphold the Arizona law's "show me your papers" requirement but prohibit police officers from arresting people on minor immigration charges, taking the teeth out of the law's enforcement.\par \par \uc2 "I would have preferred to see the Supreme Court give more latitude to states, not less. And the states, now under this decision, have less authority, less latitude, to enforce immigration law," Romney told donors at a fundraiser in Scottsdale, a wealthy enclave outside Phoenix. The event raised $2 million, the campaign said.\par \par \uc2 Romney instead used Monday's ruling as an opportunity to criticize President Barack Obama for what he termed inaction on immigration reform until recently. Romney called for a national immigration strategy and insisted he would tackle immigration during his first year in office.\par \par \uc2 America's immigration laws have "become a muddle," Romney said.\par \par \uc2 The court struck down three major provisions of Arizona's immigration enforcement law: requiring all immigrants to obtain or carry immigration registration papers; making it a state criminal offense for an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  to seek work or hold a job; and allowing police to arrest suspected illegal immigrants without warrants.\par \par \uc2 Romney campaign spokesman Rick Gorka told reporters that "the governor supports the states' rights to craft immigration laws when the federal government had failed to do so." He repeatedly declined to answer questions about whether Romney agreed with the ruling or whether the former Massachusetts governor would support the kind of laws the high court found mostly unconstitutional.\par \par \uc2 Romney has worked to soften his rhetoric on immigration policy since becoming the presumptive Republican nominee for president. During the Republican primary, he never endorsed Arizona's immigration law.\par \par \uc2 Asked in February during a GOP primary debate in Arizona whether he supported tough immigration enforcement that includes arrests, Romney said: "I think you see a model in Arizona." He then mentioned the federal E-Verify program -- it requires businesses to check the legal status of their employees -- as one way to reduce the number of illegal immigrants in a particular state.\par \par \uc2 Romney then said: "So going back to the question that was asked, the right course for America is to drop these lawsuits against Arizona and other states that are trying to do the job Barack Obama isn't doing."\par \par \uc2 The Obama administration sued to block the Arizona law soon after its enactment two years ago.\par \par \uc2 Protestors greeted Romney at his fundraiser in Scottsdale. The court's immigration ruling "leaves us with a bittersweet victory," said Carlos Galindo, an Obama supporter and the president of the Phoenix-area Immigrant Advocacy Foundation.\par \par \uc2 5\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120625e86p002fm\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) - Congressional Democrats and Republicans scrambled for election-year gain from the Supreme Court's ruling Monday that threw out key provisions of Arizona's immigration law but upheld one that requires police to check the status of people who might appear to be in the U.S. illegally.\par \par \uc2 Democrats said the ruling risks encouraging racial profiling, while Republicans said it strengthens the right of states to make and enforce their own immigration policies. In hot pursuit of Hispanic voters this presidential and congressional election year, members of both parties said the elected branches of the federal government need to overcome deep divisions and enact long-term laws affecting the nation's 11 million illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 The court unanimously upheld the "show me your papers" requirement of the state's law. But even there, the justices said the provision could be subject to additional legal challenges, and they blunted somewhat its effectiveness by prohibiting officers from arresting people on immigration charges.\par \par \uc2 The court struck down three major provisions of the Arizona law, including one requirement for all immigrants to obtain or carry registration papers, another making it a state criminal offense for an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  to seek work or hold a job and a third allowing police to arrest suspected illegal immigrants without warrants.\par \par \uc2 Democrats said the decision shows President Barack Obama was right to challenge the law's constitutionality and praised him for deferring the deportation of some young illegal immigrants. But they also said the decisions could encourage discrimination.\par \par \uc2 "I am greatly concerned that the provision putting American citizens in danger of being detained by police unless they carry their immigration papers at all times will lead to a system of racial profiling," said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Democrat from swing-state Nevada.\par \par \uc2 Republicans, meanwhile, chastised Obama for his executive order and said the court appeared to validate some of the controversial law.\par \par \uc2 "The Arizona law was born out of the state's frustration with the burdens that illegal immigration and continued drug smuggling impose on its schools, hospitals, criminal justice system and fragile desert environment, " Arizona Republican Sens. John McCain and Jon Kyl said in a joint statement.\par \par \uc2 "And," they added, "an administration that chooses to set enforcement policies based on a political agenda, not the laws as written by Congress."\par \par \uc2 The chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus left open the prospect of taking Arizona to court again over the remaining "show me your papers" provision.\par \par \uc2 "When three out of four provisions of a state's law are struck down, it obviously can't be viewed as a victory for the state," said Rep. Charles Gonzales, D-Texas. "We will be watching very closely how Arizona exercises this part of the law."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120625e86p002ex\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc20}{\*\bkmkend toc20}\b \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2  voids most of Arizona immigration law but upholds 'show-me-papers' requirement\b0\par\par\uc2 By MARK SHERMAN   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 1,280 \uc2 words\par \uc2 25 June 2012\par 19:19\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2012.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) - A divided \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2  threw out major parts of Arizona's tough crackdown on illegal immigrants Monday in a ruling sure to reverberate through the November elections. The justices unanimously approved the law's most-discussed provision -- requiring police to check the immigration status of those they stop for other reasons -- but limited the consequences.\par \par \uc2 Although upholding the "show me your papers" requirement, which some critics say could lead to ethnic profiling, the justices struck down provisions that created state crimes allowing local police to arrest people for federal immigration violations. And they warned against detaining people for any prolonged period merely for not having proper immigration papers.\par \par \uc2 The mixed outcome vindicated the Obama administration's aggressive challenge to laws passed by Arizona and the five states -- Alabama, Georgia, Indiana, South Carolina and Utah -- that followed its lead in attempting to deal with illegal immigration in the face of federal inaction on comprehensive reform.\par \par \uc2 The administration had assailed the Arizona law as an unconstitutional intrusion into an area under federal control.\par \par \uc2 Justice \uc2 Anthony Kennedy\uc2 , joined in his majority opinion by conservative Chief Justice \uc2 John Roberts\uc2  as well as three liberal justices, said the impasse in Washington over immigration reform did not justify state intrusion.\par \par \uc2 "Arizona may have understandable frustrations with the problems caused by illegal immigration while that process continues, but the state may not pursue policies that undermine federal law," Kennedy said. That part of the ruling drew a caustic dissent from Justice \uc2 Antonin Scalia\uc2 , who said the Obama administration doesn't want to enforce existing immigration law.\par \par \uc2 A second opinion with potentially important implications for the presidential campaign is expected when the court meets Thursday to issue its final rulings this term. The court's verdict on Obama's landmark health care overhaul probably will come that day.\par \par \uc2 In other action Monday, the court:\par \par \uc2 -- Ruled unconstitutional by a 5-4 vote state laws that require judges to impose sentences of life in prison with no possibility of parole on convicted murderers younger than 18.\par \par \uc2 -- Struck down, also 5-4, a Montana law limiting corporate campaign spending, declining to revisit the two-year-old ruling in the Citizens United case.\par \par \uc2 The Arizona decision landed in the middle of a presidential campaign in which President Barack Obama has been heavily courting Latino voters and Republican challenger Mitt Romney has been struggling to win Latino support. During a drawn-out primary campaign, Romney and the other GOP candidates mostly embraced a hard line on the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants, though Romney has lately taken a softer tone.\par \par \uc2 Obama said he was pleased that the court struck down key parts of Arizona's law but was concerned about what the high court left intact.\par \par \uc2 "No American should ever live under a cloud of suspicion just because of what they look like," the president said in a written statement. He said police in Arizona should not enforce the provision in a way that undermines civil rights.\par \par \uc2 "What this decision makes unmistakably clear is that Congress must act on comprehensive immigration reform," Obama said.\par \par \uc2 In Scottsdale, Ariz., later Monday, Romney said he would have preferred that the court "give more latitude to the states" in immigration enforcement.\par \par \uc2 Romney told campaign donors that the law has "become a muddle" and that the states have more options to enforce their own immigration laws.\par \par \uc2 Earlier, he said in a statement, "I believe that each state has the duty -- and the right -- to secure our borders and preserve the rule of law, particularly when the federal government has failed to meet its responsibilities."\par \par \uc2 In his majority opinion, Kennedy distinguished the "show me your papers" provision from the other challenged parts of the law by pointing out that consultation between local and federal authorities already is an important part of the immigration system. Local and state police called on the Immigration and Customs Enforcement's support center more than 1 million times in 2009 alone, he said.\par \par \uc2 Kennedy said the law could -- and suggested it should -- be read to avoid concerns that status checks could lead to prolonged detention. "Detaining individuals solely to verify their immigration status would raise constitutional concerns," he said, but he did not define what would constitute too long a detention.\par \par \uc2 A divided court struck down these three major provisions:\par \par \uc2 -- Requiring all immigrants to obtain or carry immigration registration papers.\par \par \uc2 -- Making it a state criminal offense for an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  to seek work or hold a job.\par \par \uc2 -- Allowing police to arrest suspected illegal immigrants without warrants.\par \par \uc2 The vote was 6-2 against making it a state crime not to carry immigration papers and 5-3 against the other two provisions.\par \par \uc2 Justice Elena Kagan sat out the case because of her previous work in the Obama administration.\par \par \uc2 Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer said the ruling marked a victory for people who believe in the responsibility of states to defend their residents. The case, she said, "has always been about our support for the rule of law. That means every law, including those against both illegal immigration and racial profiling. Law enforcement will be held accountable should this statute be misused in a fashion that violates an individual's civil rights."\par \par \uc2 Civil rights groups that separately challenged the law over concerns that it would lead to rights abuses said their lawsuit would go on.\par \par \uc2 Even with the limitations the high court put on Arizona, the immigration status check still is "an invitation to racial profiling," said \uc2 American Civil Liberties Union\uc2  lawyer Omar Jadwat.\par \par \uc2 Carlos Beltran, looking for day labor work Monday in the Phoenix area, said he was glad to hear the court struck down most of the law.\par \par \uc2 "We can still be here today, find a job and go home and tell our wives we have something to eat tonight," said Beltran, who was born in the U.S. but whose parents are illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 With the ruling, however, Beltran said the potential for racial profiling will become worse. "I don't want to have my dad afraid of looking for a job. He has four kids. They shouldn't be afraid of trying to make a living," he said.\par \par \uc2 The Obama administration sued to block the Arizona law soon after its enactment two years ago. Federal courts had refused to let the four key provisions take effect.\par \par \uc2 The other states adopted variations on Arizona's law. Parts of those laws also were on hold pending the outcome of the \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2  case.\par \par \uc2 Chief Justice Roberts and \uc2 Justices Stephen Breyer\uc2 , Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor joined all of Kennedy's opinion.\par \par \uc2 Scalia and Justice \uc2 Clarence Thomas\uc2  would have allowed all the challenged provisions to take effect. Justice \uc2 Samuel Alito\uc2  would have allowed police to arrest immigrants without papers who seek work, and also to make arrests without warrants.\par \par \uc2 Scalia, in an unusual move, pointed to facts not in the record before the court when he described Obama's recently announced plans to ease deportation rules for some children of illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 "The president said at a news conference that the new program is `the right thing to do' in light of Congress' failure to pass the administration's proposed revision of the Immigration Act. Perhaps it is, though Arizona may not think so. But to say, as the court does, that Arizona contradicts federal law by enforcing applications of the Immigration Act that the president declines to enforce boggles the mind," Scalia said.\par \par \uc2 The case is Arizona v. U.S., 11-182.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writer Jacques Billeaud in Phoenix contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120625e86p002af\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ALBUQUEQUE, N.M. (AP) - When the Obama administration's announced earlier this month that some illegal immigrants would be allowed to stay in the U.S. legally, college-aged immigrants across the nation cheered and texted each other in excitement.\par \par \uc2 But one group took special pride in the announcement -- immigrant students in New Mexico.\par \par \uc2 Long before there was a national student immigrant movement pushing the DREAM Act -- a federal proposal that would give young illegal immigrants a pathway to citizenship through college enrollment and military service -- immigrant students in New Mexico were organizing in 2001 to change various state laws that eventually would transform New Mexico into one of the most immigrant friendly states in the nation.\par \par \uc2 The students convinced state lawmakers to pass a bill allowing illegal immigrants who graduated from New Mexico schools to attend state colleges at in-state tuition rates and get financial aid. They joined a coalition of religious and immigrant rights groups to successfully push a state law that allowed illegal immigrants to obtain state driver's licenses, and have led protests against Gov. Susana Martinez's recent attempts to repeal the law. And the students trained \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students in high school on organizing protests, lobbying key lawmakers and sharing personal stories as a way to build sympathy for their causes.\par \par \uc2 The students, many who were brought over to the U.S. illegally as children, had grown up largely in New Mexico. Some barely even knew Spanish, organizers say.\par \par \uc2 During the first Immigrant Day of Action to support the DREAM Act in 2001, New Mexico sent a group to Washington D.C. and would continue to take part in national events.\par \par \uc2 "New Mexico played a big role in the shaping of the immigrant student movement," said Marcela Diaz of Somos Un Pueblo Unido, a Santa Fe-based immigrant rights group. "They were ahead of the game in many ways."\par \par \uc2 Michael A. Olivas, director of the Institute of Higher Education Law & Governance at the University of Houston and author of a number of states' in-tuition bills for immigrant students, said in each state he worked to push bills in the early 2000s he did not deal with immigrant students, except in New Mexico.\par \par \uc2 "They would talk to lawmakers, putting their parents at risk," he said.\par \par \uc2 The movement in New Mexico, however, was relatively small and groups would disperse as fast as they were created, said Olivas, who pushed then-Gov. Bill Richardson to sign the state tuition bill in 2005. Still, Olivas said some students' personal stories helped convince state lawmakers to support the New Mexico version of the bill.\par \par \uc2 Diaz said the passage of that state law came after four years of work by immigrant students who pressed lawmakers and individual colleges to allow illegal immigrants access to in-tuition rates.\par \par \uc2 Mayte Garcia, now 27, was one of those students who helped organized New Mexico immigrant students as a teen. She said when President Obama made his announcement earlier this month, she couldn't help but reflect on the role the state's student immigrants played in the debate.\par \par \uc2 But even with the New Mexico friendly laws, the recent University of New Mexico graduate said that without changes in federal law that would affect her immigration status, immigrants like her can't get jobs even with college degrees.\par \par \uc2 And some of the early activists won't qualify under Obama's plan since it is only aimed at illegal immigrants 30 years old and younger.\par \par \uc2 "This wasn't just about us," said Garcia, who plans to apply for a work permit under Obama's plan. "It was about fighting for what's right."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Follow Russell Contreras on Twitter at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://twitter.com/russcontreras"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://twitter.com/russcontreras}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120624e86o002m9\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) - A Virginia man will spend at least 25 years in prison after admitting he tried to conduct a suicide bomb attack against the U.S. Capitol.\par \par \uc2 Amine El Khalifi, 29, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Morocco living in Alexandria, pleaded guilty Friday in U.S. District Court, admitting that he plotted with men he thought were al-Qaida operatives to attack the Capitol. In reality, El Khalifi was the target of an undercover FBI operation.\par \par \uc2 He was arrested in February in a parking garage near the Capitol, wearing what he thought was an explosive-laden suicide vest. The vest, provided by undercover operatives, was actually inert. A gun he planned to use to shoot his way past security in the building was also inoperable.\par \par \uc2 Friday's plea deal requires the judge to sentence El Khalifi to a term of between 25 and 30 years when the sentencing is held Sept. 14. In the plea deal, prosecutors state they will ask for a 30-year sentence.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors said El Khalifi had revealed his intention to kill Americans to an undercover FBI operative he thought was a member of the al-Qaida terrorist group. He spoke of wanting to attack a synagogue and kill Army generals, prosecutors said, before settling on a plot to blow himself up inside the U.S. Capitol as an act of martyrdom. Officials have said the public was never in danger.\par \par \uc2 El Khalifi admitted in Friday's hearing that, in preparation for the planned attack, he detonated a test bomb at a quarry in West Virginia and told the undercover operatives that he was hoping for an even larger explosion when he attacked the Capitol. He told the operatives he would be happy if he could kill 30 people. He also asked his handlers to remotely detonate the suicide bomb at the Capitol if he were incapacitated.\par \par \uc2 El Khalifi's lawyer, federal public defender Ken Troccoli, declined comment after Friday's hearing. In earlier court papers, defense lawyers said they were exploring both the possibility of a plea deal or presenting an entrapment defense at trial.\par \par \uc2 However, prosecutors say in their own court filings it was El Khalifi who continually upgraded the plans, wanting bigger bombs and higher-profile targets. They say it was El Khalifi who brought up the idea of targeting the Capitol, after first setting his sights on a building in Alexandria, a synagogue and a busy Washington restaurant.\par \par \uc2 "It was Mr. Khalifi who picked the targets. It was Mr. Khalifi who picked the weapons he was going to use," said Neil MacBride, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, whose office prosecuted the case.\par \par \uc2 MacBride said El Khalifi is just the latest among roughly a half-dozen "homegrown terrorists" who have been caught in FBI sting operations and investigations in the past few years in the northern Virginia area alone.\par \par \uc2 Bryan Paarmann, assistant special agent in the FBI's counterterrorism division in its Washington Field Office, said El Khalifi is part of a disturbing trend of homegrown violent extremists.\par \par \uc2 "They come from all walks of life," he said. "How they started on the path to radicalization is unique in every case," said Paarmann, who declined to comment on what specifically motivated el Khalifi.\par \par \uc2 El Khalifi could have faced life in prison if convicted at trial.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writer Eric Tucker contributed to this report from Washington.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120622e86m001fn\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 DENVER (AP) - A Denver college's move to establish a special tuition rate for \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students has spiraled into a legal fight involving the state's attorney general, with school officials Wednesday standing by their position that their decision is legal.\par \par \uc2 The fight between \uc2 Metropolitan State College of Denver\uc2  officials and Republican Attorney General John Suthers emerges as President Barack Obama has spotlighted the immigration debate, issuing an order saying certain young illegal immigrants will no longer face deportation.\par \par \uc2 Metro State earlier this month established for illegal immigrants who meet specific requirements a tuition rate that is significantly lower than the nonresident rate.\par \par \uc2 The move followed a failed legislative attempt from Colorado Democrats that would have established such a tuition tier at schools across the state.\par \par \uc2 Suthers responded Tuesday, saying Metro State's unilateral decision is "not supported by governing law." He said the tuition discount amounts to a "public benefit" that illegal immigrants are not entitled to under state and federal laws.\par \par \uc2 The GOP has criticized Metro State's decision, and the chair of the budget-writing Joint Budget Committee, Republican Rep. Cheri Gerou, called college officials to a packed hearing room at the state Capitol to discuss their rationale.\par \par \uc2 Metro State President \uc2 Stephen Jordan\uc2  said after the meeting that he believes the college action is on solid legal ground.\par \par \uc2 "First of all, we haven't changed our position yet," he said. "Our position is what the board (of trustees) adopted. But we clearly have to take the attorney general's opinion into consideration and assess what does that mean."\par \par \uc2 Stephens said the college is also weighing how Obama's announcement last week impacts the decision they've made. Stephens said that under the president's decision, it's possible the students they would be serving could have legal status, potentially nullifying Suthers' argument that public benefits cannot be granted to illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 The new tuition rate, which Metro State approved June 7, lets certain illegal immigrants attend college at about $3,600 per semester. That's about half what they'd pay under the nonresident rate, but still higher than the resident rate.\par \par \uc2 To qualify, illegal immigrants must have graduated from a Colorado high school after attending for at least three years and also state that they were seeking, or would seek, legal status.\par \par \uc2 Suthers said that, according to federal law, it is up to the Legislature to decide whether colleges can set discounted tuition rates for illegal immigrants\par \par \uc2 Colorado Republican lawmakers this year rejected an attempt from Democrats to grant discounted tuition to illegal immigrants who graduated from state high schools. The legislation would have made it optional for colleges to participate, but most higher education institutions supported the bill.\par \par \uc2 Suthers said colleges cannot act unilaterally on the issue. He issued the opinion at the request of the Colorado Community College System, which asked if colleges could do what Metro State did. CCCS supported this year's legislation.\par \par \uc2 Stephens told lawmakers their policy aligns with the college's mission to make education affordable to underserved students.\par \par \uc2 "We've often had this mantra of being an institution of opportunity," he said.\par \par \uc2 He said the college calculated the new rate for illegal immigrants was not subsidized by state funds. But Republican Sen. Kent Lambert said it appears Suthers' legal opinion "would refute almost every point that you have made this afternoon."\par \par \uc2 Thirteen states, including California and Texas, have crafted and passed tuition legislation for illegal immigrants and they have survived legal challenges.\par \par \uc2 Sarahi Hernandez, 19, would benefit from the new tuition rate. She's an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  attending Metro State and currently pays the out-of-state rate of nearly $8,000 per semester. Her family from the Mexican state of Durango brought her to the U.S. when she was 8 months old, she said.\par \par \uc2 "I do get a lot of support from my parents. I bake, I babysit, I do whatever I can to be able to get the money to go to school because it's my priority at this point," Hernandez said. "Unfortunately, I do know a lot of people that aren't as lucky and can't afford it."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Find Ivan Moreno on Twitter: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://twitter.com/IvanJourno"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://twitter.com/IvanJourno}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120621e86l0001i\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) - Two years after voters in Fremont approved a controversial immigration ordinance, the rule remains mired in court and residents are still split about whether it addresses a serious problem or needlessly tarnishes the city's image.\par \par \uc2 Voters in the eastern Nebraska city of 26,000 easily approved the measure, which banned hiring or renting to illegal immigrants and required businesses to use federal E-Verify software to confirm that potential employees were not illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 But court challenges have limited its implementation and opponents haven't softened their views on the measure.\par \par \uc2 Luis Canahui, a native of Guatemala who's lived in Fremont for more than a decade, said he was surprised the "racist and discriminatory" law hasn't prompted more Hispanic families to leave town. Canahui, the founder of the group Un Fremont Con Dignidad (One Fremont with Dignity), said he fears that many will move if the rental requirements are upheld in court.\par \par \uc2 "The ordinance election two years ago demonstrated that we are a town divided, and that continues to be true," Canahui said. "The demographic impact -- families leaving because of the ordinance -- has not been as widespread as we thought that it might be."\par \par \uc2 Supporters of the ordinance gathered petition signatures and placed the measure on the June 21, 2010, ballot, saying they feared local jobs were going to illegal immigrants and that local action was needed due to what they saw as lax federal enforcement of immigration policies.\par \par \uc2 The proposal came after years of rapid growth in Fremont's Hispanic population, which climbed from 165 in 1990 to 3,149 in 2010, largely due to the availability of jobs at two nearby meatpacking plants. It's unclear how many of those residents are illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 The ACLU Nebraska Foundation, along with several U.S.-born Latino home renters and a Fremont landlord, challenged the ordinance in federal court. In February, the judge approved the requirement that businesses use the E-verify software to screen job applicants but rejected the one that would deny city-issued housing permits to illegal immigrants, saying it was discriminatory and interfered with federal law.\par \par \uc2 The ACLU and the city are both appealing the decision, with the city pushing to have the entire ordinance upheld and the civil liberties group seeking to have the rest of the law dismissed.\par \par \uc2 "It's still an undercurrent in the community," said Steven Dahl, a Fremont landlord and bakery store owner who is a plaintiff in the lawsuit. "Everybody's pretty tired of it. We're just waiting now for what will happen in the courts."\par \par \uc2 Supporters of the ordinance also expressed frustration that after two years, only the E-Verify requirement has taken effect.\par \par \uc2 "I figured, yeah, it would take a little while, but not this long," said John Wiegert, a fifth-grade teacher who helped lead the petition drive.\par \par \uc2 Although the E-Verify requirement has been implemented, Fremont Mayor Scott Getzschman said no businesses found that an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  had applied for a job.\par \par \uc2 Wiegert said he hopes that surrounding Dodge County will implement a similar E-Verify requirement, since two meatpacking plants just outside the city limits aren't bound by Fremont's rules.\par \par \uc2 Spokesmen for those companies, however, note that they already use E-Verify.\par \par \uc2 City officials estimate it will cost $450,000 in the first year to put the new regulations in place, because the city will have to develop new forms. The city also added a secretary to check business records and make sure they are complying.\par \par \uc2 The city has spent $94,000 defending the ordinance in court, and lawyers for opponents have asked the judge to order the city to pay fees of more than $1 million.\par \par \uc2 Ron Tillery, president of the Fremont Area Chamber of Commerce, said many of the city's roughly 3,000 companies already were using E-Verify, but the ordinance has been a headache for some business owners who weren't familiar with the free software. That can take three or four hours, Tillery said.\par \par \uc2 "By and large, businesses are incorporating it into their daily routine," Tillery said. "But it remains a topic of conversation. It's an issue people around town talk and wonder about. And, in some cases, there are very strong opinions."\par \par \uc2 Tillery said he's disappointed that the immigration debate has distracted attention from Fremont's efforts to recruit new businesses, including a high-end organic pet food maker and a high-tech data park that the city is marketing to technology companies.\par \par \uc2 Residents said it doesn't seem the ordinance has prompted immigrants to leave the area.\par \par \uc2 Population changes in Fremont since voters approved the ordinance aren't available, but Dodge County's Hispanic population has increased a little more than 2 percent annually since 2010, according to the University of Nebraska's Center for Public Affairs Research. That's far slower than in past year but likely reflects a national slowing in Hispanic immigration due to the sluggish economy, said David Drozd, the center's research coordinator.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Follow Grant Schulte on Twitter: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://twitter.com/grantschulte"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://twitter.com/grantschulte}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120620e86k002gb\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) - Five Albuquerque-area residents were named in a recently unsealed federal indictment connected to what authorities say is a multistate scam abusing New Mexico's law that allows illegal immigrants to obtain driver's licenses.\par \par \uc2 Federal investigators say 30 people from five states were involved in a scheme using false documents to fraudulently obtain New Mexico driver's licenses for illegal immigrants in other states.\par \par \uc2 New Mexico and Washington state are the only states that allow illegal immigrants to obtain the same driver's license as a U.S. citizen, but proof of a local address is required.\par \par \uc2 The indictment unsealed late Tuesday said the New Mexico residents would help people in South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia and Georgia get the licenses.\par \par \uc2 "It was part of the conspiracy that individuals who were in the country illegally ... and not residents of New Mexico, would obtain driver's licenses from New Mexico using false documents and through false representations," the indictment said.\par \par \uc2 About 92,000 foreign national licenses have been issued in New Mexico since 2003. Out of those, only 16,000 license holders filed a state income tax return this year, officials say.\par \par \uc2 The indictment comes after authorities earlier this month busted up a driver's license fraud ring in the eastern New Mexico communities of Clovis and Portales.\par \par \uc2 In the latest case, the homes and businesses of a Rio Rancho man and four Albuquerque residents were raided Tuesday by federal and state authorities in connection with a South Carolina-based scheme.\par \par \uc2 Among those indicted were Albuquerque residents Ivon Baray-Luna, 31; Alfred Padilla, 47; Victor Alvarez, 25; Elizabeth "La Guera" Lopez, 42; and Rio Rancho resident Alfredo Saenz, 39.\par \par \uc2 It was unclear if any had attorneys.\par \par \uc2 Demesia Padilla, secretary of the state Taxation and Revenue Department, which oversees New Mexico's Motor Vehicle Division, said her department was notified about the ring in November 2011 and began to monitor questionable transactions. Since then, Padilla said state officials have identified at least 164 driver's licenses linked to the ring, and those are in the process of being canceled.\par \par \uc2 She also said state officials expect to find more questionable licenses connected to the ring and other busts from different schemes in the future.\par \par \uc2 "It's going to continue to be this way until legislators do the right thing," Padilla said.\par \par \uc2 Republican Gov. Susana Martinez has repeatedly pressed state lawmakers to repeal New Mexico's law over fraud concerns.\par \par \uc2 "New Mexico's driver's license policy has once again attracted criminal elements to our state in pursuit of a government-issued identification card," Martinez said in a statement. "Our current system jeopardizes the safety and security of all New Mexicans and it is abundantly clear that the only way to solve this problem is to repeal the law that gives driver's licenses to illegal immigrants."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Follow Russell Contreras on Twitter at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://twitter.com/russcontreras"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://twitter.com/russcontreras}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120620e86k0015z\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 CENTENNIAL, Colo. (AP) - Michelle Obama began her second day of political campaigning in the West by reflecting on wildfires that have burned down hundreds of homes and charred huge sections of Colorado and other states in the region.\par \par \uc2 "I just want to say that our hearts and our prayers are with all of the families affected by the fires here in this state and in other states out West," Mrs. Obama told nearly 3,000 Democrats gathered for a campaign rally in suburban Denver.\par \par \uc2 She then thanked firefighters and emergency responders working on the blazes, saying, "America stands behind you every step of the way."\par \par \uc2 A 93-square-mile wildfire burning in northern Colorado has destroyed more homes than any other in state history. And elsewhere Wednesday, firefighters were battling blazes in Arizona, California, Idaho, New Mexico, Nevada and even the president's home state of Hawaii.\par \par \uc2 After talking about the fires, the first lady gave a routine campaign speech to a crowd south of Denver. Mrs. Obama said the economy is on the mend, that the president's health care overhaul has helped young people and that the administration is working to help students afford college.\par \par \uc2 As in Nevada on Tuesday, Mrs. Obama also talked up her husband's order that his administration stop deporting some young illegal immigrants. She also said he's still pushing for a federal bill on citizenship for college students.\par \par \uc2 "He believes that it is time to stop denying responsible young people opportunities in this country just because they're the children of undocumented immigrants," she said to applause.\par \par \uc2 The first lady did not mention the flap at a Denver college, where officials set a special tuition rate for \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students that the state's Republican attorney general says is against the law.\par \par \uc2 Michelle Obama talked for about 30 minutes, then headed south to Pueblo for an afternoon rally. The first lady also stopped in Colorado last month, when she was in Colorado Springs at the 2012 Warrior Games to applaud more than 200 U.S. servicemen for their courage.\par \par \uc2 In the south Denver gym Wednesday, Michelle Obama was welcomed with near-constant cheers. About two dozen protesters stood outside the high school, waving signs critical of the president. One protester said she came out to tell the first lady and the president's supporters that Colorado's economy is recovering too slowly.\par \par \uc2 "Our unemployment rate has just not moved off the dime much," said Lori Horn, a 50-year-old Centennial woman with two children enrolled in the high school where Mrs. Obama spoke.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120620e86k0013l\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 DENVER (AP) - The \uc2 Metropolitan State College of Denver\uc2  does not have legal authority to create a discounted tuition category for illegal immigrants, Colorado Attorney General John Suthers said in an opinion released Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 Suthers said that under federal law, the Legislature must decide whether to create a new tuition rate for illegal immigrants and that Metro State's decision "is simply not supported by governing law."\par \par \uc2 "The General Assembly may continue to consider this issue," said Suthers, a Republican. "In the meantime, however, state-supported institutions of higher education in Colorado cannot act unilaterally."\par \par \uc2 Metro State trustees approved the new tuition rate earlier this month, after the Republican-led House rejected a bill in April that would've let colleges create a discounted tuition category for \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students. To qualify, the students must have graduated from a state high school after attending at least three years.\par \par \uc2 Metro State's policy, which officials said would take effect this fall, could benefit an estimated 300 students. The tuition classified as a second nonresident rate would be about $3,578 per semester. That's about half the amount currently for nonresident tuition. Tuition for in-state students is $2,152 per semester.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Colorado Department of Higher Education\uc2  had said last week that current law allows public colleges and universities to have authority to set their nonresident tuition rates. But Suthers also said previously that the matter was complicated by the fact that a Colorado law passed in 2006 forbids the state from granting some benefits, excluding emergency services, to illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 College officials did not immediately respond to calls for comment. But trustee Terrance Carroll said in a tweet that Suthers issued an opinion to support "his ideological & political beliefs not the law."\par \par \uc2 The Colorado Community College System asked for Suthers' opinion on whether Metro's action was legal.\par \par \uc2 Republicans who opposed the bill this session were upset over Metro State's decision and sent a letter to Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper asking him to intervene. At the time, Hickenlooper's office said he would wait for Suthers' opinion before weighing in.\par \par \uc2 His office did not immediately issue a response.\par \par \uc2 Federal law prohibits states from granting illegal immigrants benefits not provided to U.S. citizens, such as discounted tuition not available to out-of-state students. However, 13 states, including California and Texas, have crafted and passed tuition legislation for illegal immigrants and they have survived legal challenges.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Find Ivan Moreno on Twitter: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://twitter.com/IvanJourno"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://twitter.com/IvanJourno}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120619e86j002y2\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHOENIX (AP) - Police agencies that would enforce the most controversial part of Arizona's 2010 immigration law are expected to get squeezed by legal challenges from opposite sides if the U.S. Supreme Court upholds the law in the coming days.\par \par \uc2 Opponents of the Arizona law, known as SB1070, are likely to sue police departments on claims that officers racially profile people as they enforce the provision of the law that requires police to check the immigration status of people they stop for other reasons.\par \par \uc2 But legal challenges also are expected from the other side: from supporters who could claim that a police agency has broken the law if it restricts the enforcement of SB1070.\par \par \uc2 "There are people just waiting to challenge this law on both sides of the spectrum," said Tucson Police Chief Roberto Villasenor.\par \par \uc2 A little-known section of the law lets anyone sue an agency that has a policy that restricts the enforcement of immigration law. The provision was aimed at holding cities accountable for "sanctuary policies" that discourage or prohibit officers from inquiring about a person's immigration status. Agencies that are found by a court to have sanctuary policies face fines of $500 to $5,000 for each day such a violation remains in effect after the filing of the lawsuit.\par \par \uc2 The right to sue was among the parts of the law that were allowed to take effect in July 2010. But a federal judge has barred police from enforcing the law's more contentious sections, such as a requirement that officers check the immigration status of people they stop for other reasons.\par \par \uc2 The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to rule before the end of the month on Gov. Jan Brewer's appeal of the 2010 ruling. Legal experts expect that the court likely will uphold the requirement for immigration-status checks, siding with Arizona officials' legal argument that SB1070 is not trumped by federal immigration law.\par \par \uc2 Such a ruling will prompt groups that already have challenged the law to ask the courts to again prevent enforcement of the controversial sections based on other arguments, such as racial profiling.\par \par \uc2 While seven challenges to the law have been filed, no lawsuits have been brought to court so far that alleged that a police agency had a sanctuary policy.\par \par \uc2 The question about what types of immigration inquiries police can make came to a head in Arizona during 2007 when Phoenix police Officer Nick Erfle was killed by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , who shot the officer as he tried to arrest the immigrant on a warrant.\par \par \uc2 After his release from prison and subsequent deportation, the immigrant sneaked into the country again and was arrested for misdemeanor assault in Scottsdale, but wasn't reported to federal immigration authorities. The immigrant was fatally shot a short time later by police as he pointed a gun at a carjacking victim's head.\par \par \uc2 Phoenix revamped its policy on officers inquiring about people's immigration status after a union representing 2,500 rank-and-file officers had complained that officers were tired of seeing crimes tied to illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 Under the law's right-to-sue provision, officers are indemnified from having to pay attorney fees and other legal costs in such lawsuits unless they are found to have acted in bad faith.\par \par \uc2 Paradise Valley Police Chief John Bennett, who is president for the Arizona Association of Chiefs of Police, declined to comment on the possibility of additional lawsuits on allegations that police racially profiled people or agencies were restricting the enforcement of immigration laws.\par \par \uc2 Republican Rep. John Kavanagh of Fountain Hills, a key advocate for the 2010 law, said he wasn't expecting any lawsuits against alleging sanctuary policies because he believes officers will enforce SB1070.\par \par \uc2 "These are more red herrings brought by the opponents of SB1070 who don't want people to accept that it's reasonable," Kavanagh said.\par \par \uc2 Former Arizona Attorney General Terry Goddard, a Democrat who believed the law was misguided, said the right-to-sue provision was an unusual attempt to micromanage police departments.\par \par \uc2 "Unless you fully investigate the misdemeanor charge of being in the country without citizenship papers, you could be sued," Goddard said. "Whereas if you don't follow up on an armed robbery, you can't be sued. It's meddling with the police chief's ability to decide what's best for the safety of a community."\par \par \uc2 Former Arizona Senate President Russell Pearce, the chief sponsor of the state's 2010 immigration enforcement law, said the law's right-to-sue provision was needed to ensure that cities don't come up with restrictions on enforcing immigration law.\par \par \uc2 "It's all about compliance," Pearce said. "If you don't comply, there will be lawsuits. If you do comply, there's no problem."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120617e86h002gb\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ATLANTA (AP) - Scores of young illegal immigrants who have called the United States home for most of their lives are excited by the Obama administration's decision allowing them to stay here legally, but they have a lot of questions. Most important: Is it too good to be true?\par \par \uc2 How will it actually work? What are the risks or pitfalls?\par \par \uc2 Still, that uncertainty didn't stop text messages and social networks from buzzing with optimism Friday.\par \par \uc2 "I started shaking," said Cindy Nava, 23, of Santa Fe, N.M., who received the news in a text while on her way to class at the University of New Mexico. She immediately called an attorney, who confirmed the news.\par \par \uc2 Nava is a native of Chihuahua, Mexico, who came to the U.S. as a 7-year-old. She wants to go to law school after she graduates with a political-science degree next year, and hopes the policy shift will allow her to work.\par \par \uc2 Some conservatives vehemently disagree with the new policy, even while expressing compassion for illegal immigrants who were brought to the country as children. They say Obama's unilateral action by executive order deliberately skirts the law.\par \par \uc2 Young illegal immigrants acknowledge they could be at risk if Republican presidential challenger Mitt Romney is elected and decides to reverse the policy.\par \par \uc2 Renata Teodoro, who came to the U.S. from Brazil when she was 6, says she plans to apply for a work permit, anyway.\par \par \uc2 "We've been putting ourselves out there for a long time so we are willing to take a chance," said Teodoro, 24, leader of the Boston-based Student Immigrant Movement who has led vigils and organized illegal immigrants from around the country. Teodoro's photo is featured on the cover of this week's Time Magazine along with that of other young immigration activists.\par \par \uc2 For many young illegal immigrants who have long wished to stay in the country and work without fear of deportation, President Barack Obama's announcement Friday is like a dream come true.\par \par \uc2 "When I heard the news today, I said, `Oh my God. Finally, justice has come,'" said Ricky Campos, a 23-year-old college student in Maryland who was brought to the U.S. illegally from El Salvador when he was 12. "I couldn't stop screaming. I can't believe this is happening. I think that finally President Obama has heard us, and he believes in justice as much as we do."\par \par \uc2 Gaby Pacheco, 27, is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Ecuador who has been an outspoken advocate for the DREAM Act, legislation that would carve a path to U.S. citizenship for those who qualify. Multiple attempts to get the measure through Congress have failed.\par \par \uc2 Pacheco said she hopes the new policy means she'll finally be able to pursue a career working with autistic children.\par \par \uc2 In the U.S. since age 7, Pacheco has a bachelor's degree in special education and associate degrees in early education and music.\par \par \uc2 She's been making ends meet by doing tutoring work as a private contractor, one of the few ways people without legal status can work.\par \par \uc2 "My biggest desire and dream is to work with autistic children," Pacheco said. "I've been feeling empty for the last couple of years because I haven't been able to fulfill that dream."\par \par \uc2 Pacheco was one of four students who walked 1,500 miles from Miami to Washington in 2010 to bring attention to the DREAM Act.\par \par \uc2 "I think this is a testament to the power that our community has, that together when we set ourselves to do something, it can be accomplished," she said.\par \par \uc2 Some of Pacheco's peers are not so confident.\par \par \uc2 They have questions about how the new policy will work and worry it won't go far enough to protect them from deportation. Some are dismissing it as a meaningless election-year stunt.\par \par \uc2 "This is politics again," said Dulce Guerrero, a 19-year-old activist who was one of several students arrested last summer in Atlanta while protesting the plight of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  youth. "They're just trying to win the Latino vote."\par \par \uc2 Under the administration's new plan, illegal immigrants will be immune from deportation if they are under 30 and brought to the U.S. before they turned 16; have been in the country for at least five continuous years; have no criminal history; have graduated from a U.S. high school or earned a GED; or who have served in the military. They also can apply for a work permit that will be good for two years with no limits on how many times it can be renewed.\par \par \uc2 Jonathan Perez, 24, said the latest announcement isn't enough to move him or six other activists out of an Obama campaign office in Los Angeles where they have been holed up since Thursday.\par \par \uc2 They're demanding an executive order to halt deportations of young people who would be eligible for the DREAM Act if it passed.\par \par \uc2 The biggest problem with Obama's latest announcement, Perez said, is that students will need to identify themselves to immigration authorities -- with no guarantee they'll get a work permit.\par \par \uc2 "We want something that is actually going to stop all of our deportations," said Perez, a native of Colombia who lives in Montebello, Calif.\par \par \uc2 He said immigration authorities don't consistently follow a directive issued last year to focus more on serious criminals when making decisions about deportation, and worries the new policy is equally vulnerable.\par \par \uc2 Perez said he and others will continue protests at Obama campaign offices across the country until the president issues an executive order ending deportations for those who would qualify for the DREAM Act.\par \par \uc2 "We're going to stand here and make sure they can't come to our community trying to get votes ... while they continue to deport millions of people," he said.\par \par \uc2 Many Republicans, including former Arizona Senate President Russell Pearce, chief sponsor of the state's 2010 immigration enforcement law, said the administration is making an unconstitutional end-run around Congress. Currently president of the Ban Amnesty Now group, Pearce characterized the change as a "backdoor amnesty."\par \par \uc2 "The effect is just the destruction of the rule of law," Pearce said. "It's a slap in the face to those who come here legally."\par \par \uc2 Jan Barton is a citizen activist in Georgia who has been a strong supporter of the state's tough law targeting illegal immigration. She said she is disappointed by the new policy.\par \par \uc2 "I have compassion for those children that are here illegally, but this amnesty sends a message to all that it is OK to break the law," she said. "Millions of Americans are unemployed, and giving job permits to these people will take jobs away from Americans."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writers Amy Taxin in Orange County, Calif., Christine Armario in Miami, Russell Contreras in Albuquerque, and Jacques Billeaud in Phoenix contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120615e86f002dk\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 DENVER (AP) - The Colorado Attorney General's Office is reviewing a discounted tuition rate for \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students recently set by the \uc2 Metropolitan State College of Denver\uc2  -- a proposal that has divided state lawmakers for years.\par \par \uc2 Republican Attorney General John Suthers said Wednesday many state colleges and universities are interested in legal issues surrounding the matter. "So we're very vigorously researching this issue," he said.\par \par \uc2 Suthers said he could not disclose who requested the review because of attorney-client privilege and he does not yet know if any findings will be publicly released.\par \par \uc2 Metro State's action last week came two months after the Colorado House defeated a measure to make tuition cheaper for illegal immigrants. The college's decision angered Republicans.\par \par \uc2 "I think this presents a huge dilemma for the state because I very much support local control, but I also believe that that decision is the wrong decision," said Rep. Cindy Acree, a Republican from Arapahoe and Elbert counties.\par \par \uc2 Republicans sent a letter to Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper on Wednesday asking him to block Metro State's new tuition rate and warning of potential lawsuits. The lawmakers say they're already drafting legislation for next year to repeal Metro State's action.\par \par \uc2 Hickenlooper's spokesman, Eric Brown, said the governor supported the legislation that failed this year, but he hasn't weighed in on Metro State's decision and is awaiting Suthers' review.\par \par \uc2 "We will wait until that review is complete before commenting further," Brown said.\par \par \uc2 Public colleges and universities have authority to set their nonresident tuition rates, said Chad Marturano, director of legislative affairs at the \uc2 Colorado Department of Higher Education\uc2 . CDHE supported this year's legislation, but Marturano said it has no position on what Metro State did and is "monitoring this to see how it unfolds."\par \par \uc2 The Republican lawmakers said in the letter to the governor that they disagree with the assessment that colleges and universities have broad authority over setting their nonresident rates.\par \par \uc2 Federal law prohibits states from granting illegal immigrants benefits not provided to U.S. citizens, such as discounted tuition not available to out-of-state students. However, 13 states, including California and Texas, have crafted and passed tuition legislation for illegal immigrants and they have survived legal challenges.\par \par \uc2 But a Colorado law passed in 2006 forbids the state from granting some benefits, excluding emergency services, to illegal immigrants. That's one issue attorneys will need to examine in the Metro State case, Suthers said.\par \par \uc2 This year's bill, sponsored by Democrats, would have given colleges and universities the choice of creating a third tuition category for illegal immigrants who graduated from Colorado highs schools. The students would pay a higher rate than in-state students because they would not receive a state subsidy. But the rate would still be substantially less than what out-of-state students pay.\par \par \uc2 Metro State's policy, expected to take effect this fall, could benefit an estimated 300 students, college officials said. The tuition classified as a second nonresident rate would be about $3,578 per semester. That's about half the amount currently for nonresident tuition. Tuition for in-state students is $2,152 per semester.\par \par \uc2 To qualify for the discounted rate, illegal immigrants must have graduated from a Colorado high school after attending for at least three years and state that they are seeking or will seek legal status, provisions that were in this year's legislation. But Metro State's new rate is a bit higher than what lawmakers proposed because illegal immigrants will be paying for other state support, including a $650 capital construction fee for using campus buildings.\par \par \uc2 Democratic lawmakers said they pushed for legislation because they weren't sure colleges and universities had the power to settle the matter on their own.\par \par \uc2 "What we need to do as elected officials is not put barriers in place that could prevent these students, no matter what country they come from, from getting a public education," said Denver Democratic Rep. Angela Williams, a co-sponsor of the bill.\par \par \uc2 Even with Metro State's action, Democrats say they will introduce a bill next year to make the policy statewide.\par \par \uc2 Metro State President \uc2 Stephen Jordan\uc2  said making college more accessible to illegal immigrants educated in Colorado schools is an important part of Metro State's mission to serve low-income, first-generation college students.\par \par \uc2 "That's who we serve," he said.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Find Ivan Moreno on Twitter: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://twitter.com/IvanJourno"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://twitter.com/IvanJourno}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120614e86e0003z\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 DENVER (AP) - The Colorado Attorney General's Office is reviewing a discounted tuition rate for \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students recently set by the \uc2 Metropolitan State College of Denver\uc2  -- a proposal that has divided state lawmakers for years.\par \par \uc2 Republican Attorney General John Suthers said Wednesday many state colleges and universities are interested in legal issues surrounding the matter. "So we're very vigorously researching this issue," he said.\par \par \uc2 Suthers said he could not disclose who requested the review because of attorney-client privilege and he does not yet know if any findings will be publicly released.\par \par \uc2 Metro State's action last week came two months after the Colorado House defeated a measure to make tuition cheaper for illegal immigrants. The college's decision angered from Republicans.\par \par \uc2 "I think this presents a huge dilemma for the state because I very much support local control, but I also believe that that decision is the wrong decision," said Rep. Cindy Acree, a Republican from Arapahoe and Elbert counties.\par \par \uc2 Republicans sent a letter to Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper on Wednesday asking him to block Metro State's new tuition rate and warning of potential lawsuits. The lawmakers say they're already drafting legislation for next year to repeal Metro State's action.\par \par \uc2 Hickenlooper's spokesman, Eric Brown, said the governor supported the legislation that failed this year, but he hasn't weighed in on Metro State's decision and is awaiting Suthers' review.\par \par \uc2 "We will wait until that review is complete before commenting further," Brown said.\par \par \uc2 Public colleges and universities have authority to set their nonresident tuition rates, said Chad Marturano, director of legislative affairs at the \uc2 Colorado Department of Higher Education\uc2 . CDHE supported this year's legislation, but Marturano said it has no position on what Metro State did and is "monitoring this to see how it unfolds."\par \par \uc2 The Republican lawmakers said in the letter to the governor that they disagree with the assessment that colleges and universities have broad authority over setting their nonresident rates.\par \par \uc2 Federal law prohibits states from granting illegal immigrants benefits not provided to U.S. citizens, such as discounted tuition not available to out-of-state students. However, 13 states, including California and Texas, have crafted and passed tuition legislation for illegal immigrants and they have survived legal challenges.\par \par \uc2 But a Colorado law passed in 2006 forbids the state from granting some benefits, excluding emergency services, to illegal immigrants. That's one issue attorneys will need to examine in the Metro State case, Suthers said.\par \par \uc2 This year's bill, sponsored by Democrats, would have given colleges and universities the choice of creating a third tuition category for illegally immigrants who graduated from Colorado highs schools. The students would pay a higher rate than in-state students because they would not receive a state subsidy. But the rate would still be substantially less than what out-of-state students pay.\par \par \uc2 Metro State's policy, expected to take effect this fall, could benefit an estimated 300 students, college officials said. The tuition classified as a second nonresident rate would be about $3,578 per semester. That's about half the amount currently for nonresident tuition. Tuition for in-state students is $2,152 per semester.\par \par \uc2 To qualify for the discounted rate, illegal immigrants must have graduated from a Colorado high school after attending for at least three years and state that they are seeking or will seek legal status, provisions that were in this year's legislation. But Metro State's new rate is a bit higher than what lawmakers proposed because illegal immigrants will be paying for other state support, including a $650 capital construction fee for using campus buildings.\par \par \uc2 Democratic lawmakers said they pushed for legislation because they weren't sure colleges and universities had the power to settle the matter on their own.\par \par \uc2 "What we need to do as elected officials is not put barriers in place that could prevent these students, no matter what country they come from, from getting a public education," said Denver Democratic Rep. Angela Williams, a co-sponsor of the bill.\par \par \uc2 Even with Metro State's action, Democrats say they will introduce a bill next year to make the policy statewide.\par \par \uc2 Metro State President \uc2 Stephen Jordan\uc2  said making college more accessible to illegal immigrants educated in Colorado schools is an important part of Metro State's mission to serve low-income, first-generation college students.\par \par \uc2 "That's who we serve," he said.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Find Ivan Moreno on Twitter: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://twitter.com/IvanJourno"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://twitter.com/IvanJourno}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120613e86d001pw\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 MOULTON, Ala. (AP) - With a flickering light shining through her long black hair and her tiny shadow moving across the patio table, Ganae Ewalt walked suspiciously toward her mother.\par \par \uc2 She had both hands behind her back and a championship smile as the moonlight reflected off her hazel eyes.\par \par \uc2 "I have something for you," the 7-year-old Moulton Elementary student said to her mother.\par \par \uc2 Apparently knowing this was going to be one of those special mother-daughter moments, Lorena Ewalt smiled and asked, "What?"\par \par \uc2 Pulling a 3-inch porcelain angel from behind her back, the daughter said: "I want you to take this with you so you will think about me and Luis."\par \par \uc2 With tears rolling down her face, Lorena said, "I love you."\par \par \uc2 "I love you, too," Ganae said as she reached to hug her mother.\par \par \uc2 "Wow," Lorena said as her daughter sat next to her. "That's why I'm doing this. I have to make things right."\par \par \uc2 Lorena Ewalt, a 40-year-old wife of an American citizen and mother of two American-born kids, has been an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  for 21 years. On Friday, she left the United States to start the path to American citizenship. She left knowing there is a possibility she may never be allowed to return to the U.S.\par \par \uc2 "I am a good person, and I have put my trust in God," Lorena said. "I just believe He has a plan in America for me and my family."\par \par \uc2 Neighbors and friends agree with her sentiments and have written letters of support for Lorena to show immigration officials.\par \par \uc2 "She is an inspiration, a great mother and wife, and I admire her for what she is doing," Deborah King of Moulton said.\par \par \uc2 Moulton Mayor Ray Alexander has been neighbors of the Ewalt family for 10 years. He called her a model citizen, adding Lorena and her husband "have provided strong family values for their children."\par \par \uc2 Her path to American citizenship starts Friday when she meets with immigration officials at the U.S. Embassy in Mexico.\par \par \uc2 Contrary to popular belief, a non-American cannot attain citizenship simply by marrying an American. Lorena's husband, 31-year-old Bruce Ewalt, filed the petition seeking an immigrant visa.\par \par \uc2 "The petition has to be filed by an American citizen," he said.\par \par \uc2 Decatur attorney Allen Stoner has handled these types of immigration matters. He said the consulate likely will review Lorena's application before she arrives for the interview and give her an answer before she leaves.\par \par \uc2 "If the petition is denied, they will give her an answer why," Stoner said.\par \par \uc2 If a visa is granted, Lorena Ewalt can apply for a green card, which is good for 10 years and would allow her to apply for citizenship.\par \par \uc2 The whole endeavor can be a lengthy and expensive process.\par \par \uc2 "When you get approved for a green card, you are essentially a permanent resident of the U.S.," Stoner said.\par \par \uc2 Lorena was born June 11, 1971, one of six children to farmers in Marelos, the country's second-smallest state, south of Mexico City.\par \par \uc2 She had dreams but no career in Mexico in 1989 when she came to Texas "to help my sister with her children."\par \par \uc2 She rode 18 hours on a bus from her hometown to Piedras Negras, a bustling Mexican city on the border of Eagle Pass, Texas.\par \par \uc2 Her brother-in-law, an American citizen, was waiting to pick her up. Lorena said they went through two checkpoints and "got lucky" -- border officials were suspicious of the vehicle in front of them and pulled it to the side.\par \par \uc2 "The guard waived us on through," she said.\par \par \uc2 Lorena hadn't planned to stay long, but she found a job working for Don and Maria Beach.\par \par \uc2 When the Beach family moved to Moulton, Lorena moved to Dallas with her sister, and later returned to Mexico.\par \par \uc2 Lorena said she was miserable in her home country, primarily because she was sick most of the time.\par \par \uc2 In 1998, doctors identified a tumor on her brain as the source of her illness. For almost a year, she took vitamins intravenously three times per day.\par \par \uc2 Lorena thought she was going to die because her parents couldn't afford to pay for brain surgery. Her mother went daily to a Catholic chapel near the family home and prayed for a miracle.\par \par \uc2 A neighbor, who was a nurse, saw Lorena's mother crying at the chapel.\par \par \uc2 "She got my medical records and carried them to a doctor at the hospital where she worked," Lorena said.\par \par \uc2 Because the hospital was for children, doctors agreed to do the surgery at no cost after hours.\par \par \uc2 Risky?\par \par \uc2 "Sure, but I was 27 and in so much pain," Lorena said.\par \par \uc2 Less than a year after the surgery, the Beach family called to check on her. They were in San Antonio, Texas, on vacation, and Lorena got to thinking about America again.\par \par \uc2 This time, she would travel not by bus to the Texas border. She flew from Mexico City to Reynosa, Mexico, and waited for nightfall.\par \par \uc2 As daylight faded, Lorena and a man walked across the Rio Grande into McAllen, Texas.\par \par \uc2 "It was so scary because in some places the water was at my neck," she said.\par \par \uc2 Lorena wanted to travel to San Antonio, but someone she didn't know gave her a ticket to Houston.\par \par \uc2 "I had to go there or go back to Mexico," she said.\par \par \uc2 She made contact with the Beach family, but they already had returned to Moulton.\par \par \uc2 Maria Beach still lives in Moulton and acknowledged that Lorena Ewalt is her friend, but declined to discuss their situation further. Don Beach could not be reached for comment.\par \par \uc2 At that point, Lorena moved to the Dallas area, where her sisters lived, and found a job at \uc2 McDonald's\uc2 . This is where she met Bruce Ewalt.\par \par \uc2 The couple married May 22, 2002, and moved to Moulton in 2003 to reunite with the Beaches. They had two children and five years ago hired attorneys to help Lorena file papers for citizenship.\par \par \uc2 The lawyers did nothing, the Ewalts said.\par \par \uc2 Finally, Bruce took a friend's advice and filed the paperwork himself.\par \par \uc2 Immigration officials scheduled Lorena an interview in December, but she postponed it because it would have meant leaving her children in the middle of a school term.\par \par \uc2 "I just cried and cried in December," Lorena said. "It was such an emotional time, but I felt like I had to choose between my children and doing the interview. I couldn't leave them."\par \par \uc2 She shed more tears in February when her father died following an extended illness.\par \par \uc2 "I couldn't attend his funeral," she said.\par \par \uc2 Lorena also missed the funeral of her only brother, who died in a automobile accident in 2002.\par \par \uc2 "He was the best brother in the world," she said.\par \par \uc2 The Ewalts are putting faith in the system and believing that immigration officials will keep their family together.\par \par \uc2 "I've lost my brother and father, and I don't want to lose my husband and children," Lorena said.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Information from: The Decatur Daily, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.decaturdaily.com/decaturdaily/index.shtml"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.decaturdaily.com/decaturdaily/index.shtml}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120611e86b002i2\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) - A Homeland Security spending bill approved by the GOP-led House on Thursday includes a provision to bar Immigration and Customs Enforcement from providing abortions for \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  detainees.\par \par \uc2 The measure, proposed by Rep. Robert Aderholt, R-Ala., would block ICE from using agency funding to provide abortion services for detainees except in the case of rape, incest or if there life of the mother would be endangered.\par \par \uc2 The provision was attached to a $46 billion Homeland Security spending bill approved on a party-line 234-182 vote. It has little chance of surviving in the Democratic-controlled Senate.\par \par \uc2 Barbara Gonzalez, an ICE spokeswoman, said the agency has not paid for abortion services since its 2003 creation.\par \par \uc2 The agency's policy on abortion services is the same as the Justice Department's rule for the Bureau of Prisons, which restricts access to those services except in cases of rape, incest or if the life or the mother is in danger.\par \par \uc2 Though the provision isn't likely to become law, its approval in the Republican-controlled House does send a political message in an election year when abortion, health care and reproductive rights have become issues.\par \par \uc2 Last month a proposed ban on gender-based abortion failed by 20 votes in the House. That bill also had little chance of survival in the Senate. The vote was seen as an effort by both sides made an appeal for women's votes.\par \par \uc2 The House on Thursday night also approved a provision to the Homeland Security bill that would block spending for ICE's newly created public advocate, whose office fields complaints and questions about immigration policy. Republicans have criticized the appointment, saying that the Obama administration was putting illegal immigrants head of the interests of Americans.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120608e8680009v\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The office was closed to the public.\par \par \uc2 Veronica Gomez, 24, of Antioch, Calif., and Javier Hernandez, 23, of Denver, vowed to only drink fluids until Obama implements the DREAM Act, which would allow the children of illegal immigrants to enroll in college or the military as a way to eventually establish citizenship or permanent residency in the U.S.\par \par \uc2 Gomez and Hernandez are illegal immigrants who graduated from college.\par \par \uc2 "We're not playing games," said Hernandez, a native of Mexico. Other activists planned similar protests at Obama campaign offices across the country, he said.\par \par \uc2 In a written statement, the Obama campaign said it agrees that "DREAMers" who serve in the military or go to college should become citizens.\par \par \uc2 However, it said passing the DREAM Act, which has stalled in Congress, "requires that Republicans stop standing in the way."\par \par \uc2 Gomez and other \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  protesters were walking from San Francisco to Washington, D.C., to advocate for the DREAM Act. She and Hernandez decided to occupy the Denver office because Colorado is considered a presidential swing state, protester Jonatan Martinez, 25, said.\par \par \uc2 Police said no action would be taken unless they get a complaint. The campaign said it planned no immediate action.\par \par \uc2 Tuition for illegal immigrants is a sensitive issue in Colorado. In April, state lawmakers rejected a measure to join 12 other states that allow \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students to pay in-state or subsidized tuition at state colleges, rather than out-of-state tuition.\par \par \uc2 On Thursday, board members at \uc2 Metropolitan State College of Denver\uc2  decided to offer \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students a lower tuition rate that is half the out-of-state tuition rate. College president \uc2 Stephen Jordan\uc2  said the new rate would affect about 300 students this fall.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120607e867002b8\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 MOULTON, Ala. (AP) - With a flickering light shining through her long black hair and her tiny shadow moving across the patio table, Ganae Ewalt walked suspiciously toward her mother.\par \par \uc2 She had both hands behind her back and a championship smile as the moonlight reflected off her hazel eyes.\par \par \uc2 "I have something for you," the 7-year-old Moulton Elementary student said to her mother.\par \par \uc2 Apparently knowing this was going to be one of those special mother-daughter moments, Lorena Ewalt smiled and asked, "What?"\par \par \uc2 Pulling a 3-inch porcelain angel from behind her back, the daughter said: "I want you to take this with you so you will think about me and Luis."\par \par \uc2 With tears rolling down her face, Lorena said, "I love you."\par \par \uc2 "I love you, too," Ganae said as she reached to hug her mother.\par \par \uc2 "Wow," Lorena said as her daughter sat next to her. "That's why I'm doing this. I have to make things right."\par \par \uc2 Lorena Ewalt, a 40-year-old wife of an American citizen and mother of two American-born kids, has been an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  for 21 years. On Friday, she left the United States to start the path to American citizenship. She left knowing there is a possibility she may never be allowed to return to the United States.\par \par \uc2 "I am a good person, and I have put my trust in God," Lorena said. "I just believe He has a plan in America for me and my family."\par \par \uc2 Neighbors and friends agree with her sentiments and have written letters of support for Lorena to show immigration officials.\par \par \uc2 "She is an inspiration, a great mother and wife, and I admire her for what she is doing," Deborah King of Moulton said.\par \par \uc2 Moulton Mayor Ray Alexander has been neighbors of the Ewalt family for 10 years. He called her a model citizen, adding Lorena and her husband "have provided strong family values for their children."\par \par \uc2 Her path to American citizenship starts Friday when she meets with immigration officials at the U.S. Embassy in Mexico.\par \par \uc2 Contrary to popular belief, a non-American cannot attain citizenship simply by marrying an American. Lorena's husband, 31-year-old Bruce Ewalt, filed the petition seeking an immigrant visa.\par \par \uc2 "The petition has to be filed by an American citizen," he said.\par \par \uc2 Decatur attorney Allen Stoner has handled these types of immigration matters. He said the consulate likely will review Lorena's application before she arrives for the interview and give her an answer before she leaves.\par \par \uc2 "If the petition is denied, they will give her an answer why," Stoner said.\par \par \uc2 If a visa is granted, Lorena Ewalt can apply for a green card, which is good for 10 years and would allow her to apply for citizenship.\par \par \uc2 The whole endeavor can be a lengthy and expensive process.\par \par \uc2 "When you get approved for a green card, you are essentially a permanent resident of the U.S.," Stoner said.\par \par \uc2 Lorena was born June 11, 1971, one of six children to farmers in Marelos, the country's second-smallest state, south of Mexico City. She had dreams but no career in Mexico in 1989 when she came to Texas "to help my sister with her children."\par \par \uc2 She rode 18 hours on a bus from her hometown to Piedras Negras, a bustling Mexican city on the border of Eagle Pass, Texas.\par \par \uc2 Her brother-in-law, an American citizen, was waiting to pick her up. Lorena said they went through two checkpoints and "got lucky" -- border officials were suspicious of the vehicle in front of them and pulled it to the side.\par \par \uc2 "The guard waived us on through," she said.\par \par \uc2 Lorena hadn't planned to stay long, but she found a job working for Don and Maria Beach. When the Beach family moved to Moulton, Lorena moved to Dallas with her sister, and later returned to Mexico.\par \par \uc2 Lorena said she was miserable in her home country, primarily because she was sick most of the time.\par \par \uc2 In 1998, doctors identified a tumor on her brain as the source of her illness. For almost a year, she took vitamins intravenously three times per day.\par \par \uc2 Lorena thought she was going to die because her parents couldn't afford to pay for brain surgery. Her mother went daily to a Catholic chapel near the family home and prayed for a miracle.\par \par \uc2 A neighbor, who was a nurse, saw Lorena's mother crying at the chapel.\par \par \uc2 "She got my medical records and carried them to a doctor at the hospital where she worked," Lorena said.\par \par \uc2 Because the hospital was for children, doctors agreed to do the surgery at no cost after hours.\par \par \uc2 "Sure, but I was 27 and in so much pain," Lorena said.\par \par \uc2 Less than a year after the surgery, the Beach family called to check on her. They were in San Antonio, Texas, on vacation, and Lorena got to thinking about America again.\par \par \uc2 This time, she would travel not by bus to the Texas border. She flew from Mexico City to Reynosa, Mexico, and waited for nightfall.\par \par \uc2 As daylight faded, Lorena and a man walked across the Rio Grande into McAllen, Texas.\par \par \uc2 "It was so scary because in some places the water was at my neck," she said.\par \par \uc2 Lorena wanted to travel to San Antonio, but someone she didn't know gave her a ticket to Houston.\par \par \uc2 "I had to go there or go back to Mexico," she said.\par \par \uc2 She made contact with the Beach family, but they already had returned to Moulton.\par \par \uc2 Maria Beach still lives in Moulton and acknowledged that Lorena Ewalt is her friend, but declined to discuss their situation further. Don Beach could not be reached for comment.\par \par \uc2 At that point, Lorena moved to the Dallas area, where her sisters lived, and found a job at \uc2 McDonald's\uc2 . This is where she met Bruce Ewalt.\par \par \uc2 The couple married May 22, 2002, and moved to Moulton in 2003 to reunite with the Beaches. They had two children and five years ago hired attorneys to help Lorena file papers for citizenship.\par \par \uc2 The lawyers did nothing, the Ewalts said.\par \par \uc2 Finally, Bruce took a friend's advice and filed the paperwork himself.\par \par \uc2 Immigration officials scheduled Lorena an interview in December, but she postponed it because it would have meant leaving her children in the middle of a school term.\par \par \uc2 "I just cried and cried in December," Lorena said. "It was such an emotional time, but I felt like I had to choose between my children and doing the interview. I couldn't leave them."\par \par \uc2 She shed more tears in February when her father died following an extended illness.\par \par \uc2 "I couldn't attend his funeral," she said.\par \par \uc2 Lorena also missed the funeral of her only brother, who died in a automobile accident in 2002.\par \par \uc2 "He was the best brother in the world," she said.\par \par \uc2 The Ewalts are putting faith in the system and believing that immigration officials will keep their family together.\par \par \uc2 "I've lost my brother and father, and I don't want to lose my husband and children," Lorena said.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Information from: The Decatur Daily, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.decaturdaily.com/decaturdaily/index.shtml"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.decaturdaily.com/decaturdaily/index.shtml}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120604e864001zp\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc52}{\*\bkmkend toc52}\b \uc2 Many brought to US illegally as children find paths to college, careers\b0\par\par\uc2 By GOSIA WOZNIACKA   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 1,345 \uc2 words\par \uc2 26 May 2012\par 11:31\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2012.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 FRESNO, Calif. (AP) - Going to college seemed inconceivable when Adriana Sanchez, the 12-year-old daughter of farm workers, was brought from Mexico to Central California and the family overstayed their visas.\par \par \uc2 Even though Sanchez excelled in high school, she was in the country illegally, lacked a Social Security number and work permit, and didn't qualify for financial aid. But she volunteered hundreds of hours and paid her way through college and graduate school with a dozen internships.\par \par \uc2 Now 24, Sanchez graduated last week from California State University, Fresno with a master's degree in International Relations, a full-time job and no loans to repay. Using a gray area in federal law, she works as an independent contractor.\par \par \uc2 "For most undocumented students, you have to put yourself out there. You volunteer, you go beyond what regular students do," Sanchez said. "That's what connects us to opportunities. Now employers call me."\par \par \uc2 With thousands of young adults who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children now holding college degrees, Sanchez and others are finding creative ways to get around the legal roadblocks and find a career. They are getting work experience, opening businesses and seeking professional licenses in their fields.\par \par \uc2 The Associated Press interviewed about two dozen such graduates across the country. Some, like many legal graduates, are struggling in a grim economy. But others do highly-skilled work, though not always in their professions. Many are "out" about their status despite the risk of deportation; a few asked not to be identified for fear it could cost them their jobs or alert immigration authorities.\par \par \uc2 "There's a pool of talented young people who in their hearts believe they're American, because they're raised and educated here, speak fluent English and have a level of education that equals or surpasses that of average Americans," said Roberto Gonzales, a University of Chicago sociology professor who has collected data on hundreds of such young adults. "Our colleges don't teach them to be undocumented immigrants."\par \par \uc2 The growth in young illegal immigrants with college degrees is spurred by demographics -- children who crossed the border with their parents are coming of age -- and by laws granting illegal immigrants in-state tuition, Gonzales said. Eleven years ago, California and Texas passed such laws, followed by a dozen other states.\par \par \uc2 No one knows how many illegal immigrants are enrolled in colleges or have graduated; schools don't collect such data. But in 2010, an estimated 96,000 young adults without legal status held at least an associate's degree or higher, according to a report from the \uc2 Migration Policy Institute\uc2 , a nonpartisan Washington think tank.\par \par \uc2 What motivated them, Sanchez said, was hope for the passage of federal legislation that would provide a path to citizenship for those who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children and attended college.\par \par \uc2 But 11 years later, the DREAM Act -- the Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors measure -- is in political gridlock.\par \par \uc2 Some graduates who are here illegally defer going into the workplace by getting another advanced degree, including the Ph.D., according to interviews. Others leave the country. Others work under the table in low wage jobs, still hoping for immigration reform.\par \par \uc2 But many, like Sanchez -- who once dreamed of a career with the U.S. Department of State -- are driven to find meaningful work without papers.\par \par \uc2 Although federal law prohibits employers from knowingly hiring illegal immigrants, it does not require those who hire independent contractors to ask for proof of immigration status. As a result, the client who pays for services is not necessarily breaking the law even if the contractor isn't authorized to work in the United States, said Stephen Yale-Loehr, a law professor at Cornell Law School.\par \par \uc2 And while self-employed illegal immigrants still violate immigration law, they may avoid additional grounds for deportation if they don't present counterfeit documents, Yale-Loehr said.\par \par \uc2 Sanchez consults full-time for a Fresno-area education nonprofit, and teaches literacy and English at an adult school and a domestic violence shelter. But she lives with major frustration. Her parents, who have been crossing the border to work in the fields since the 1970's, are legal residents and her oldest brother is a U.S. citizen through marriage, but it would take years for Sanchez to get a green card through them and pursue her dream of becoming a diplomat.\par \par \uc2 "I'm here, I have this education and all these aspirations," she said. "I could do so much more, but I can't."\par \par \uc2 Other \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  graduates are pursuing professional licenses in fields such as law and nursing.\par \par \uc2 Courts in California and Florida are considering cases involving two law school graduates who passed their state bars to determine whether they should be allowed to get licenses to practice law in those states. Both graduates are illegally in this country after being brought here as children.\par \par \uc2 While such legal issues play out, Cesar Vargas -- a CUNY School of Law graduate who entered the country illegally when he was 5 years old -- passed the New York bar exam and opened a legislative lobbying firm, DRM Capitol Group LLC.\par \par \uc2 "I found out that I can do this and in a legal way," Vargas, 28, said. He recruited several other so-called Dreamers and a U.S. citizen to work with him.\par \par \uc2 Though he once planned to be a prosecutor, he's now contributing to congressional blogs and planning to open a Dreamers' Chamber of Commerce.\par \par \uc2 "We're creating businesses in media, web design and political campaigning," he said. "It wasn't by choice, but we're challenging the anti-immigration rhetoric that all illegal immigrants steal Americans' jobs. We're creating jobs and we're hiring U.S. citizens."\par \par \uc2 Organizations and industry leaders have stepped up to help graduates without legal status start careers. The Dream Resource Center at UCLA places such graduates at job sites throughout the country via its national internship program called Dream Summer.\par \par \uc2 San Francisco-based Educators for Fair Consideration, or E4FC, connects graduates with lawyers and Silicon Valley leaders. Mentors such as Laurene Powell Jobs, widow of \uc2 Apple Inc\uc2 . co-founder \uc2 Steve Jobs\uc2 , and Palm Pilot inventor Jeff Hawkins provide financial support, life and legal advice and networking clout.\par \par \uc2 One option they're exploring is getting companies to sponsor graduates for H-1B visas, temporary employment visas for specialty occupations. It has been done in a few cases. But it's risky; the young person has to leave the country and could be barred from returning for ten years.\par \par \uc2 "We're really looking hard for solutions," Hawkins said. "What else can these kids do? They are desperate. They want to work, they want to practice what they learned in college. What do you tell them? Become an undocumented housekeeper? They have advanced degrees."\par \par \uc2 But critics say those degrees should not mean preferential treatment to legalization.\par \par \uc2 "They're illegal immigrants, so being a college graduate doesn't make any difference," said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a Washington group that advocates tighter immigration policies.\par \par \uc2 Despite such sentiments, many graduates have come out publicly about their status and formed a nationwide network through social media, marches and conferences.\par \par \uc2 Experts say a growing number, like Isabel Castillo of Harrisonburg, Va., who was 6 when she was smuggled into the U.S. from Mexico, have ecome politically active. Castillo, who couldn't use her social work degree from \uc2 Eastern Mennonite University\uc2 , waited tables and volunteered with education and immigrant rights groups.\par \par \uc2 Now, she works full-time advocating for passage of the DREAM Act, leading local rallies, squaring off with Virginia politicians and running local political campaigns.\par \par \uc2 "I never thought I'd be doing this, it's very political," she said. "It wasn't part of my interests in college. Now, people are calling me a future congresswoman."\par \par \uc2 --------\par \par \uc2 Follow Gosia Wozniacka on Twitter at (at)GosiaWozniacka\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120526e85q001mu\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 DENVER (AP) - A program that automatically checks the immigration status of all jail inmates in Colorado quietly went into effect this week following years of opposition and fears it could lead to deportation for otherwise minor offenses or ensnare crime victims.\par \par \uc2 The Department of Homeland Security's "Secure Communities" program took effect Tuesday across all 64 Colorado counties. Under the program, sheriff's departments and jail officials submit fingerprints of all inmates taken at the time of booking to federal officials for a check of immigration status.\par \par \uc2 Denver, Arapahoe and El Paso counties began participating in the program in February. Since then, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has identified about 5,000 illegal immigrants in Colorado, nearly 800 of whom were then deported or left the country voluntarily.\par \par \uc2 Of those now out of the country, 230 had been convicted of serious crimes such as murder and sexual assault, according to Homeland Security statistics. Secure Communities has been implemented in 46 states, as well as in parts of Alabama, Illinois and Pennsylvania. Maine has yet to implement the program, according to ICE.\par \par \uc2 The program has raised concerns among civil rights and immigrant rights advocates, including the Colorado American Civil Liberties Union, which said it documented three cases in Garfield County where women were detained by ICE after calling police to report domestic violence. The ACLU said the women were reported to ICE under a 2006 state law that requires law enforcement agencies to report suspected illegal immigrants to federal authorities.\par \par \uc2 Virginia Urtusuastegui, 30, a housekeeper from Glenwood Springs, said she spent 13 days in detention last summer on an immigration violation after she called police for help during a violent dispute with her husband. She was arrested on a false reporting charge when she refused to cooperate with police for fear her husband would be arrested. She said she was released after her paperwork for a work visa was approved.\par \par \uc2 "To tell you the truth, I'm horrified of police," Urtusuastegui said in Spanish.\par \par \uc2 Not every \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  reported to ICE will end up in deportation proceedings, said Washington-based ICE spokeswoman Nicole Navas.\par \par \uc2 Once ICE learns someone is in the country illegally, agents and ICE prosecutors examine the case and determine if that person falls under their priorities for deportation, which include those who pose a threat to national security, multiple immigration violators, and convicted criminals. There also are provisions to protect victims of domestic violence and other crimes, Navas said.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120524e85o001ty\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 DENVER (AP) - A Garfield County woman said she was incarcerated for 13 days on an immigration violation after she called police for help during a violent dispute with her husband.\par \par \uc2 Virginia Urtusuastegui's case is one of three that the Colorado American Civil Liberties Union said it has documented in the Western Slope county in which suspected illegal immigrants who were alleged victims of domestic violence were arrested and inadvertently reported to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents after calling police for help.\par \par \uc2 ACLU attorney \uc2 Rebecca Wallace\uc2  said Wednesday the cases expose problems with a 2006 state law that requires authorities to report suspected illegal immigrants to ICE at the time they're booked in jail.\par \par \uc2 The law includes a provision to exclude domestic violence cases because victims inadvertently get arrested when investigators are unable to sort out the perpetrator from the victim. But the \uc2 ACLU\uc2  argues not waiting until suspects are convicted in such cases to report them to ICE could subject an alleged victim to deportation proceedings.\par \par \uc2 The organization says that's exactly what happened in Urtusuastegui's case, and it has sent a letter to Garfield County Sheriff Lou Vallario asking him to change his agency's policy.\par \par \uc2 Vallario said the \uc2 ACLU\uc2 's allegations are part of an effort to undermine his department's relationship with ICE and that he "will not be bullied or intimidated into complying with what the \uc2 ACLU\uc2  thinks is more appropriate for the country."\par \par \uc2 He said he's not reporting victims to ICE, he's following the law, and he has no plans to change his policy of reporting suspected illegal immigrants at the time they're booked into jail. He also said he's sympathetic to crime victims, regardless of their immigration status.\par \par \uc2 "If you are a victim of a crime, you should report it and be provided all of the efforts and services available to victims of any crimes," Vallario said in a statement. "I fully understand the dynamics of (domestic violence) and the associated difficulties with victims reporting their abuse. This is not a singular issue for the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  population but an issue of all victims of domestic violence."\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 ACLU\uc2  and immigrant rights advocates are concerned that such cases discourage illegal immigrants from reporting crimes.\par \par \uc2 In an interview with The Associated Press, Urtusuastegui, 30, a housekeeper from Glenwood Springs, said in Spanish that she called police June 19 after enduring a beating that left her with a bump on her head and bruises on her arms and on her feet.\par \par \uc2 She said she felt relief when police arrived but then panicked. She didn't want her husband taken to jail, so she refused to cooperate. She was arrested and booked into the Garfield County jail on a charge of false reporting.\par \par \uc2 "It had gotten serious and I was afraid that something else would happen to me, and to me it seemed easy to dial 911," she said of her initial phone call.\par \par \uc2 She said an ICE agent showed up within three hours of being booked into jail.\par \par \uc2 Washington-based ICE spokeswoman Nicole Navas declined to comment on Urtusuastegui's case, citing privacy laws.\par \par \uc2 "It was a terrible shock. You don't know what to think, what to say," Urtusuastegui said of her arrest. "You think you're calling police so they can help you, not so they can do what they did to me."\par \par \uc2 Local prosecutors dropped the case against Urtusuastegui four days after her arrest. But because ICE had been notified, Urtusuastegui was placed on an immigration hold and was not immediately eligible for bail, she said. Her husband was not charged, she said.\par \par \uc2 She said she was transported to Park County jail, some 75 miles away, where word came 13 days after her arrest that she was being released. An application for legal status filed by her father in 1996, when she was teenager, had come through and she was granted a work visa, said Wallace, the ACLU attorney, and Urtusuastegui. The visa allows Urtusuastegui to work and live in the U.S. while she awaits approval of her permanent resident application. Urtusuastegui is originally from Mexico.\par \par \uc2 "I know that what I went through is nothing," Urtusuastegui said. "I know of cases where other women have been through worse."\par \par \uc2 Wallace said the other two documented cases involve women who did not wish to be identified because their immigration cases are pending.\par \par \uc2 She would like to see Garfield County adopt a policy similar to some other Colorado jurisdictions, like nearby Mesa County, where deputies wait until convictions in domestic violence cases to report suspected illegal immigrants to ICE.\par \par \uc2 "We want effective law enforcement," Wallace said.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120524e85o00013\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

LOZANO   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 628 \uc2 words\par \uc2 23 May 2012\par 16:17\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2012.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 HOUSTON (AP) - The mother of a teenage Dallas runaway who gave authorities a false name and wound up deported to South America has filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against officials with the Justice Department and Homeland Security contending her daughter was illegally detained and deported.\par \par \uc2 The suit, filed Tuesday by Johnisa Turner on behalf of her daughter Jakadrien Turner, is asking for $15 million in damages. It also discloses publicly for the first time that while in Colombia, Jakadrien Turner became pregnant by a 29-year-old man.\par \par \uc2 Jakadrien Turner was 14 when she was picked up for shoplifting last year at a Houston mall and identified herself to authorities as a 21-year-old Colombian national. She subsequently was deported and spent seven months in Colombia, where she turned 15, and lived in shelters before being returned to the U.S. in January after her grandmother and Dallas police tracked her down.\par \par \uc2 "Ms. Turner's illegal detention and deportation are the direct and foreseeable consequence of official policies, patterns, practices and customs that manifest not only intentional discrimination based on race and ethnicity and a failure to recognize basic principles of due process, but also a reckless disregard for human life and liberty," according to the lawsuit.\par \par \uc2 Defendants named in the suit include Attorney General Eric Holder and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, as well as various officials with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\par \par \uc2 ICE and its parent agency, the Department of Homeland Security, do not comment on pending litigation, said ICE spokeswoman Gillian Christensen.\par \par \uc2 The Justice Department did not immediately return an email seeking comment.\par \par \uc2 ICE has previously said it had found no evidence to substantiate the teenager's claims she tried to give her real identity to agency officials.\par \par \uc2 "Turner consistently used a false identity with her dealings with the Houston police, her defense attorney, ICE, the immigration court and the Colombian government. She continued to maintain this false identity as reflected in her social media postings for six months while in Colombia, never claiming to be a United States citizen," ICE said in a January statement that Christensen referred to the AP on Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 The teenager's attorney, Ray Jackson, said federal authorities were ultimately at fault for what happened to his client.\par \par \uc2 "The buck should have stopped with them," he said.\par \par \uc2 The Associated Press does not normally name alleged victims of sexual abuse, but Jackson said the teenager's family agreed to make the pregnancy public to help detail what had happened to Turner as a result of her wrongful deportation. Jackson did not have details about the circumstances of Turner's pregnancy. The teenager is expected to have her baby sometime this summer, Jackson said.\par \par \uc2 The suit also said that while living in Colombia, Turner worked at a call center and lived in a group home for unwed mothers.\par \par \uc2 "She was afraid that she would be jailed in Colombia and never see her family again," according to the suit.\par \par \uc2 U.S. immigration officials have insisted they followed procedure and found nothing to indicate that the girl wasn't a Colombian woman living illegally in the country.\par \par \uc2 The Colombian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has said Turner was issued travel documents at the request of U.S. officials using information they provided.\par \par \uc2 A review by the AP of more than two dozen telephone calls Turner made while in custody in Houston showed the teenager never expressed concern that she was being misidentified as an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Colombia.\par \par \uc2 Jackson said the lawsuit would explain the phone calls and also explain "why she did what she did." He declined to offer more details.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120523e85n00192\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

SOLOMON BANDA   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 792 \uc2 words\par \uc2 23 May 2012\par 19:52\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2012.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 DENVER (AP) - A Garfield County woman said she was incarcerated for 13 days on an immigration violation after she called police for help during a violent dispute with her husband.\par \par \uc2 Virginia Urtusuastegui's case is one of three that the Colorado American Civil Liberties Union said it has documented in the Western Slope county in which suspected illegal immigrants who were alleged victims of domestic violence were arrested and inadvertently reported to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents after calling police for help.\par \par \uc2 ACLU attorney \uc2 Rebecca Wallace\uc2  said Wednesday the cases expose problems with a 2006 state law that requires authorities to report suspected illegal immigrants to ICE at the time they're booked in jail.\par \par \uc2 The law does include a provision to exclude domestic violence cases because victims inadvertently get arrested when investigators are unable to sort out the perpetrator from the victim. But the \uc2 ACLU\uc2  argues not waiting until suspects are convicted in such cases to report them to ICE could subject an alleged victim to deportation proceedings.\par \par \uc2 The organization says that's exactly what happened in Urtusuastegui's case, and it has sent a letter to Garfield County Sheriff Lou Vallario asking him to change his agency's policy.\par \par \uc2 Vallario said the \uc2 ACLU\uc2 's allegations are part of an effort to undermine his department's relationship with ICE and that he "will not be bullied or intimidated into complying with what the \uc2 ACLU\uc2  thinks is more appropriate for the country."\par \par \uc2 He said he's not reporting victims to ICE, he's following the law, and has no plans to change his policy of reporting suspected illegal immigrants at the time they're booked into jail. He also said he's sympathetic to crime victims, regardless of their immigration status.\par \par \uc2 "If you are a victim of a crime, you should report it and be provided all of the efforts and services available to victims of any crimes," Vallario said in a statement. "I fully understand the dynamics of (domestic violence) and the associated difficulties with victims reporting their abuse. This is not a singular issue for the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  population but an issue of all victims of domestic violence."\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 ACLU\uc2  and immigrant rights advocates also are concerned that such cases discourage illegal immigrants from reporting crimes.\par \par \uc2 Urtusuastegui, 30, a housekeeper from Glenwood Springs, said she called police June 19 after enduring a beating that left her with a bump on her head and bruises on her arms and on her feet.\par \par \uc2 She said she felt relief when police arrived but then panicked. She didn't want her husband taken to jail, so she refused to cooperate. She was arrested and booked into the Garfield County jail on a charge of false reporting.\par \par \uc2 "It had gotten serious and I was afraid that something else would happen to me, and to me it seemed easy to dial 911," she said of her initial phone call.\par \par \uc2 She said an ICE agent showed up within three hours of being booked into jail.\par \par \uc2 Washington-based ICE spokeswoman Nicole Navas declined to comment on Urtusuastegui's case, citing privacy laws.\par \par \uc2 "It was a terrible shock. You don't know what to think, what to say," Urtusuastegui said of her arrest. "You think you're calling police so they can help you, not so they can do what they did to me."\par \par \uc2 Local prosecutors dropped the case against Urtusuastegui four days after her arrest. But because ICE had been notified, Urtusuastegui was placed on an immigration hold and was not immediately eligible for bail, she said. Her husband was not charged, she said.\par \par \uc2 She said she was transported to Park County jail, some 75 miles away, where word came 13 days after her arrest that she was being released. An application for legal status filed by her father in 1996, when she was teenager, had come through and she was granted a work visa, said Wallace, the ACLU attorney, and Urtusuastegui. The visa allows Urtusuastegui to work and live in the U.S. while she awaits approval of her permanent resident application. Urtusuastegui is originally from Mexico.\par \par \uc2 "I know that what I went through is nothing," Urtusuastegui said. "I know of cases where other women have been through worse."\par \par \uc2 Wallace said the other two documented cases involve women who did not wish to be identified because their immigration cases are pending.\par \par \uc2 She would like to see Garfield County adopt a policy similar to some other Colorado jurisdictions, like nearby Mesa County, where deputies wait until convictions in domestic violence cases to report suspected illegal immigrants to ICE.\par \par \uc2 "We want effective law enforcement," Wallace said.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120523e85n000d5\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

(AP) - \uc2 The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey\uc2  said Tuesday it is considering replacing a security firm after an employee at Newark Liberty Airport was arrested last week for allegedly trying to hide his \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  status by using a murdered man's ID.\par \par \uc2 Port Authority Executive Director \uc2 Patrick Foye\uc2  said he will solicit proposals for companies to provide security at its facilities, including the airport. He didn't give a timetable for when a decision would be made on whether to keep FJC Security or hire a new company.\par \par \uc2 Bimbo Oyewole, a longtime security supervisor at the airport, was arrested and charged with ID theft for allegedly using the birth certificate and Social Security number of a man who was murdered in 1992. New York police don't consider Oyewole a suspect in the unsolved murder of Jerry Thomas, who was shot outside a YMCA in Queens.\par \par \uc2 Police believe Oyewole acquired Thomas' identification documents from a Nigerian cab driver who had bought them from Thomas not long before Thomas' death.\par \par \uc2 FJC employs between 800 and 1,000 security personnel who work at the New York area's three major airports, as well as bridges, tunnels and the World Trade Center site.\par \par \uc2 "For now, FJC continues to provide security guard services at our airports, tunnels, bridges and the WTC site," Foye said. "They have told us they intend to compete for the right to provide the services we need to keep our customers, employees and facilities safe and secure."\par \par \uc2 A spokesman for FJC said the company plans to take steps to ensure it maintains its relationship with the \uc2 Port Authority\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "We had a productive meeting today where we addressed the Port's legitimate concerns about operations at its facilities," Michael McKeon said Tuesday night. "We believe we have progressive solutions to address those concerns, and look forward to working with the Port to put smart new measures in place.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120523e85n0005l\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

FOLEY and NOMAAN MERCHANT   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 1,096 \uc2 words\par \uc2 20 May 2012\par 19:14\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2012.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 CHICAGO (AP) - Thousands of protesters marched through downtown Chicago on Sunday in one of the city's largest demonstrations in years, airing grievances about war, climate change and a wide range of other complaints as world leaders assembled for a NATO summit.\par \par \uc2 The protest, which stirred worries about violence in the streets, was largely peaceful until the end, when a small group of demonstrators clashed with a line of police who tried to keep them from the lakeside convention center where President Barack Obama is hosting the gathering.\par \par \uc2 The protesters tried to move east toward McCormick Place and threw objects at police. Some officers responded by swinging their batons. After more than an hour, the two sides were still locked in a standoff, with police blocking the protesters' path and the crowd refusing to leave. Some protesters appeared to have blood streaming down their faces. Authorities were seen carrying a few people away from the scene.\par \par \uc2 Esther Westlake, a recent graduate of Northeastern Illinois University, marveled at the size of the crowd. She said she had been involved in antiwar marches before the war in Iraq in Chicago, but had never seen one this big.\par \par \uc2 "It's crazy. There's so many people here," she said. "Having NATO in town is kind of exciting."\par \par \uc2 But some participants wondered whether the protest agenda was too unfocused to get the diplomats' attention.\par \par \uc2 "It seems like there's so many messages and people aren't really sure what they want to get accomplished," Westlake said. "People just need to figure out what their argument is going to be."\par \par \uc2 She worried that some protesters participated simply "to do stupid things" and cause trouble.\par \par \uc2 Some participants called for the dissolution of NATO, the 63-year-old military alliance that is holding its 25th formal meeting in Chicago. It is the first time the summit has been held in a U.S. city other than Washington.\par \par \uc2 Diplomats at the meeting planned to discuss the war in Afghanistan, European missile defense and other international security matters.\par \par \uc2 "Basically NATO is used to keep the poor poor and the rich rich," said John Schraufnagel, who traveled from Minneapolis to Chicago for the march. Since the end of the Cold War, he said, the alliance has become "the enforcement arm of the ruling 1 percent, of the capitalist 1 percent."\par \par \uc2 Peace activists joined with war veterans and people more focused on the economy. Marchers assembled at Grant Park with signs denouncing NATO, including ones that read: "War(equals)Debt" and "NATO, Go Home."\par \par \uc2 But the crowd was mostly filled with protesters whose primary concerns had little to do with the discussions at the summit.\par \par \uc2 The march lacked the size and single message that shaped the last major protest moment in Chicago, when nearly half a million people filled the city's downtown in 2006 to protest making it a felony to be an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 At one point, dozens of protesters in black clothing surged toward a much smaller group of police, throwing objects at them.\par \par \uc2 The badly outnumbered officers fought back with truncheons, and people on both sides threw punches. As police reinforcements moved in, the pack of violent protesters fled.\par \par \uc2 Authorities had planned for months to provide heightened security along the march route to protect people and property.\par \par \uc2 But unseasonably warm temperatures raised concerns about the safety of the marchers themselves. The city provided water, rest stations and cooling buses along the 2 1/2-mile protest route.\par \par \uc2 The heat offered an unexpected benefit for police: making it easier to spot potential troublemakers.\par \par \uc2 Before the summit, officers were told to keep an eye out for people wearing bulky clothing that could hide weapons or big pieces of cardboard that protesters could use to shield themselves against rubber bullets. But anyone wearing overcoats or sweatshirts was conspicuous on a 90-degree day, when many people wore T-shirts and shorts.\par \par \uc2 Organizers of Sunday's rally had initially predicted tens of thousands of protesters this weekend. But that was when the G-8 summit of leading industrial nations was also scheduled to be in Chicago. Earlier this year, President Barack Obama moved the Group of 8 economic meeting to Camp David, the secluded retreat in rural Maryland.\par \par \uc2 Chicago kept the NATO summit, which is not addressing the economy specifically. That left activists with the challenge of persuading groups as diverse as teachers, nurses and union laborers to show up for the Chicago protests even though the summit's main focus doesn't align with their most heart-felt issues.\par \par \uc2 Sunday's protest followed several smaller demonstrations over the previous two days, including a march Saturday to the home of Mayor Rahm Emanuel, Obama's former chief of staff.\par \par \uc2 Later that evening, hundreds of demonstrators zigzagged through downtown, some decrying terrorism-related charges leveled against three young men earlier in the day. Eighteen people were arrested.\par \par \uc2 Police Supt. Garry McCarthy said officers would be ready with quick but targeted arrests of any demonstrators who turn violent.\par \par \uc2 "If anything else happens, the plan is to go in and get the people who create the violent acts, take them out of the crowd and arrest them," warned McCarthy. "We're not going to charge the crowd wholesale -- that's the bottom line."\par \par \uc2 Three activists who traveled to Chicago for the summit were accused Saturday of manufacturing Molotov cocktails in a plot to attack Obama's campaign headquarters, Emanuel's home and other targets.\par \par \uc2 Defense lawyers argued that the police had trumped up the charges to frighten away peaceful protesters. They told a judge it was undercover officers who brought the firebombs to an apartment in Chicago's South Side where the men were arrested.\par \par \uc2 On Sunday, police said two other men were in custody after being accused of planning to make Molotov cocktails to be used during the NATO summit.\par \par \uc2 Sebastian Senakiewicz, 24, was charged with one felony count of terrorism/making a false threat. Mark Neiweem, 28, was charged with attempted possession of explosives. Both men were scheduled to appear in court later Sunday.\par \par \uc2 It was not immediately clear if those arrests were related to the other three.\par \par \uc2 Kris Hermes of the National Lawyers Guild said the charges seem to be part of a wider effort to scare people and diminish the size of the demonstrations.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writers Michael Tarm, Robert Ray, Carla K.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - A New Jersey airport security supervisor accused of using a murdered man's identity to hide his \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  status apparently bought the man's birth certificate and Social Security number from an intermediary before his death, police said Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 Police don't consider Bimbo Olumuyiwa Oyewole a suspect in the unsolved murder of Jerry Thomas, who was shot outside a Queens, N.Y., YMCA in 1992. But they shed some light on how the 55-year-old Nigerian allegedly assumed Thomas' identity and went on to work for 20 years as a guard and then a supervisor for a private security firm at Newark Liberty International Airport.\par \par \uc2 New York Police Department spokesman Paul Browne said investigators believe Thomas sold his identification documents to a Nigerian cab driver, who then sold them to Oyewole. Authorities have said Oyewole began using his new identity about three weeks before Thomas was shot on July 20, 1992.\par \par \uc2 Oyewole pleaded not guilty in Newark municipal court Tuesday to an identity theft charge that carries a 10-year maximum prison sentence. He also faces deportation.\par \par \uc2 The revelation that Oyewole had access to highly sensitive areas of the airport reverberated all the way to Washington, D.C., Wednesday where the House Homeland Security Committee held a previously scheduled oversight hearing on airport security breaches and grilled officials from the Transportation Security Administration, the agency charged with securing the nation's airports.\par \par \uc2 In an audit by the TSA's Office of Inspector General published Monday, coincidentally the day Oyewole was arrested, investigators found an example of an airport worker who held security badges for three airports -- each with a different birthplace listed.\par \par \uc2 John Sammon, assistant administrator for the TSA's Office of Security Policy and Industry Engagement, told lawmakers that the agency has been working on new rules that will increase identification and criminal history checks, but that even those might not have been able to detect a case like Oyewole's.\par \par \uc2 "Right now the system still has gaps, and that's what this rulemaking is for," Sammon said.\par \par \uc2 Oyewole was not hired by the TSA, which was created after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks. The private security firm that employed him most recently, \uc2 FJC Security Services\uc2 , is overseen by the \uc2 Port Authority of New York and New Jersey\uc2 , which operates the New York area's three major airports.\par \par \uc2 Port Authority\uc2  officials said they planned to meet with FJC officials to discuss re-screening employees on a regular basis.\par \par \uc2 Oyewole's ability to take Jerry Thomas' identity and obtain a job with a high security clearance suggests that the Social Security Administration was never notified of Thomas' death. Had it been, anyone using his Social Security number likely would have been discovered.\par \par \uc2 Notification is usually made by a family member and sometimes by a funeral home, according to Kevin Barrows, a former FBI agent specializing in identity fraud who now conducts corporate fraud investigations for a private company. It is generally not the responsibility of law enforcement, he said.\par \par \uc2 "Typically there's someone, usually a family member who's going to stand to gain the Social Security benefits from the deceased, so they'll have an incentive to report it," Barrows said. "Where it falls through the cracks is if you're a loner and you have no wife, or no one who has that responsibility."\par \par \uc2 That description appears to fit Thomas, who has been characterized by authorities as a drifter with few known ties at the time of his death.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writer Tom Hays in New York contributed to this story.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120516e85g001wh\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 HOUSTON (AP) - Since December 2005, a golf course on the banks of the Rio Grande has been a laboratory for a U.S. Border Patrol experiment called Operation Streamline.\par \par \uc2 Before, illegal immigrants tramped across Eagle Pass' fairways and into the hands of Border Patrol agents, knowing they wouldn't face jail.\par \par \uc2 But now, officials are using a "zero tolerance" policy, prosecuting and imprisoning the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  before returning them home as criminal convicts. U.S. Homeland Security officials have credited the experiment with helping drive border arrests to a 40-year low, and the Houston Chronicle ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://bit.ly/JosaPX"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://bit.ly/JosaPX}}}\uc2 ) reports that immigration hawks want the policy to be extended along the extent of the U.S.-Mexico border.\par \par \uc2 Some experts, though, say the United States' sluggish economy is a major factor for the drop.\par \par \uc2 "The Border Patrol has always tried new strategies, and the immigrants keep coming," Nestor Rodriguez, a University of Texas sociology professor, told the Chronicle. "What seems to make the big difference is not the border strategy but the economic recession and things that happen in the (U.S.) interior, like checking for driver's licenses and IDs."\par \par \uc2 Brittney Nystrom, director of policy and legal affairs for the National Immigration Forum, agrees with Rodriguez.\par \par \uc2 "Everything the Border Patrol claims Streamline has created could just as easily be attributed to the falling number of open jobs in the United States," she said.\par \par \uc2 Under a 1952 federal law that made it a crime to illegally enter the United States, first-time offenders can be sentenced to up to six months in prison. It rises to up to two years for a second offense. The zero-tolerance zone for Operation Streamline has been extended to include all 210 miles of the Del Rio sector and other stretches of Mexico's border with Texas, New Mexico and Arizona.\par \par \uc2 Since Operation Streamline started, reports from the Justice Department show nationwide prosecutions of first-offense misdemeanor illegal entry cases increased 218 percent -- from 15,600 in 2005 to nearly 50,000 in 2011.\par \par \uc2 Critics say the prosecutions and imprisonments have overwhelmed courts along the border, creating what federal public defender William Fry of Del Rio calls a "nightmare" for the due process rights of immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Fry told the Chronicle that many of the first offenders do not know that their convictions could disqualify them from obtaining legal entry into the United States. Also, the number of cases flooding the courts inevitably lead to mistakes, he said.\par \par \uc2 "As a consequence, believe it or not, you can sometimes find an American citizen or a lawful permanent resident on the Streamline docket," he said.\par \par \uc2 In a 2010 ruling, U.S. District Judge Sam Sparks of Austin called Streamline's cost to taxpayers "simply mind-boggling."\par \par \uc2 Top Obama administration officials say the policy is just one part of its new border enforcement strategy.\par \par \uc2 "Streamline is important, but it is a big piece of a bigger system," said Border Patrol Deputy Chief Ronald Vitiello.\par \par \uc2 But Border Patrol officials are happy with the program's results. Some days, Cesar Cantu Jr., chief of the Border Patrol's Eagle Pass Station, says he can count the number of illegal immigrants his agents catch on his two hands. That's down from a peak that he says exceeded 500 a day.\par \par \uc2 "It took some time for word to go back into Central and South America, but once it did the tide shifted," he said.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Information from: Houston Chronicle, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.houstonchronicle.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.houstonchronicle.com}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120513e85d002m5\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SEATTLE (AP) - First, it was thought the full activation of the federal immigrant jail check program was up to the states. Then in Washington state, maybe it was a county decision.\par \par \uc2 But despite objections by some state governors, local police agencies and immigrant rights groups, the federal government has been fully activating the program -- Secure Communities -- throughout the nation, including Washington state.\par \par \uc2 The decision by the Department of Homeland Security to bypass local and state agencies to collect the fingerprints necessary has left immigrant rights groups with few options left.\par \par \uc2 So now, to challenge the federal program, some are turning to their local officials.\par \par \uc2 In Seattle, immigrant rights and domestic violence groups have begun lobbying King County executive Dow Constantine to halt honoring a key component of the program. They want King County to stop holding suspected illegal immigrants in the county jail for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a practice called "detainers."\par \par \uc2 At least two other counties -- Cook County in Illinois and Santa Clara County in California -- in the country have begun ignoring detainers. San Francisco is also declining to hold illegal immigrants for the federal government.\par \par \uc2 Cook County's decision, followed by a publicized case of an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who committed a crime after being released, prompted a sharp rebuttal from the ICE's director, who said the county was compromising public safety.\par \par \uc2 Secure Communities uses fingerprint analysis to identify illegal immigrants in county jails. Local jurisdictions send the fingerprints of peopled booked in jail to the FBI. Now, ICE uses the FBI database to cross check with its own databases.\par \par \uc2 "ICE places detainers on aliens arrested on criminal charges to ensure that dangerous criminals are not released from prisons/jails and into our communities," said Andrew Munoz, ICE spokesman in Seattle, in a statement. "Even though some aliens may be arrested on minor criminal charges, they may also have more serious criminal backgrounds which disguise their true danger to society."\par \par \uc2 Immigrant advocates, though, say the program leads to racial profiling and lands too many people without criminal records in detention. They also say that it leads people to fear local police departments and hurts public trust. Some U.S. citizens have also been caught in the dragnet.\par \par \uc2 Law enforcement agents in support of the program have said the program adds another layer of security.\par \par \uc2 But in an email urging supporters to write to Constantine, Jorge Baron of the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project said: "King County has a decision to make. Will it protect our county's residents or will it choose to go along with (Secure Communities) and be complicit in tearing apart our families? Tell the King County Council to keep the County out of immigration enforcement."\par \par \uc2 Claudia Balducci, King County's director of adult and juvenile detention, declined to comment beyond saying that the county is considering the move. She said that on a daily average two or three people of 1,800 jail populations have detainers placed.\par \par \uc2 Three King County council members -- Larry Gossett, Julia Patterson and Larry Phillips -- have also written a letter in support. The three members, however, declined to provide a copy of the letter.\par \par \uc2 Counties around the state were under the impression it was a county by county decision to join the program after Gov. Chris Gregoire declined to activate it in 2010.\par \par \uc2 The program was fully activated in April for Washington state. So far, 88 percent of the nation's 3,181 jurisdictions have been activated ahead of the 2013 goal of full nationwide compliance.\par \par \uc2 In April, ICE announced that they will no longer immediately detain suspected illegal immigrants who are arrested only on minor traffic violations and have no criminal history.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120513e85d002b3\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SAN DIEGO (AP) - The American Civil Liberties Union said Thursday that border inspectors have used excessive force and performed humiliating body searches on travelers entering the United States from Mexico.\par \par \uc2 The group offered 11 examples of alleged misconduct at crossings in California, Arizona and Texas going back to 2009 in a complaint to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security that requests investigations into each one.\par \par \uc2 The 17-page letter describes a woman having her ankle cuffed to a pole at a Calexico crossing in March 2010, an inspector striking a man in the face in San Diego in April 2009 and a man being chained to a wall in Lukeville, Ariz., last year.\par \par \uc2 The ACLU said its affiliates in California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas compiled the testimonies, many from U.S. citizens.\par \par \uc2 "By no means do we believe we have captured the scope or the depth of the problem. We believe we have barely scratched the surface," said Sean Riordan, an attorney for the ACLU in San Diego.\par \par \uc2 U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which operates the ports of entry, issued a two-sentence statement that did not address specific allegations.\par \par \uc2 "CBP stresses honor and integrity in every aspect of our mission, and the overwhelming majority of CBP employees and officers perform their duties with honor and distinction, working tirelessly every day to keep our country safe. We do not tolerate corruption or abuse within our ranks, and we fully cooperate with any criminal or administrative investigations of alleged misconduct by any of our personnel, on- or off-duty," it read.\par \par \uc2 The report was released the same day that 16 members of Congress wrote Homeland Security Janet Napolitano to raise concern over the death of 42-year-old Anastasio Hernandez, who died after being shot several times with a stun gun by federal authorities at San Diego's San Ysidro border crossing in May 2010. The U.S. Justice Department is investigating.\par \par \uc2 An eyewitness video that first aired last month on PBS appears to show the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Mexico being shot while lying on the ground, surrounded by about a dozen agents. The Justice Department has declined to comment on the video.\par \par \uc2 The lawmakers wrote that Hernandez's death "may be emblematic of broader structural problems."\par \par \uc2 None of the testimonies outlined in the ACLU complaint were described as life-threatening.\par \par \uc2 Hernan Cuevas, a Chilean businessman, was allegedly strip-searched and chained to a bench for 90 minutes at the Calexico port of entry in May 2011. He told reporters Thursday that he was never told why he was being held.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120511e85b00051\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The autopsy said Hernandez was unresponsive shortly after he was shot with a stun gun, apparently three or four times.\par \par \uc2 Authorities say Hernandez was resisting agents as they were trying to return him to Mexico at San Diego's San Ysidro port of entry, the nation's busiest border crossing. The \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  and longtime San Diego resident had been deported May 25, and the Border Patrol arrested him when he tried to return to the U.S. three days later.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120510e85a000ul\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - A jury convicted an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  Wednesday of killing a father and two of his sons in a gang-related shooting that also drew attention to San Francisco's sanctuary policy.\par \par \uc2 Edwin Ramos, 25, was guilty of three counts of first-degree murder as well as a single count of attempted murder. He could face life in prison without the possibility of parole when he is sentenced on June 4.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors said Ramos opened fire on a car carrying Tony Bologna, 48, and his three sons -- Michael, 20, Matthew, 16 and Andrew -- in June 2008. They said Ramos was seeking revenge for the shooting of a fellow MS-13 gang member earlier in the day.\par \par \uc2 Under the city's sanctuary policy, Ramos, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , had never been turned over for deportation despite previous run-ins with the law as a juvenile.\par \par \uc2 On Wednesday, Jurors reached its verdict after a week of deliberating. Danielle Bologna, Tony Bologna's wife and the mother of their three sons, began sobbing aloud while the verdicts were read as her son, Andrew Bologna, the lone survivor of the attack, held her tightly.\par \par \uc2 Other family members also cried openly and cheered Many wore white T-shirts that read, Finally Justice is Served for the Bologna Family!"\par \par \uc2 Danielle Bologna later said that justice indeed had been served as she waited nearly four years to hear Ramos was guilty.\par \par \uc2 "This day really means a lot to us because justice is one of those days you have to wait for and it was worth waiting for," she said. "I feel like a huge thing has been lifted off of my shoulders."\par \par \uc2 While jurors found Ramos guilty of first degree murder for the triple homicide and believed that it was willful, deliberate and for the benefit of a gang, they were deadlocked on whether he was the actual shooter and a conspiracy to commit murder.\par \par \uc2 During his testimony, Ramos maintained he was only the driver of the car and didn't know his passenger, Wilfredo Reyes, would start shooting. Reyes has not been located.\par \par \uc2 "We are surprised that the jury could not agree on whether Mr. Ramos actually fired the gun, yet still chose to convict him on first-degree murder," Ramos' attorney, Marla Zamora, said in an email Wednesday. "Justice has not been delivered to the City of San Francisco nor the victims so long as the killer, Wilfredo Reyes, is still on the streets."\par \par \uc2 District Attorney George Gascon disagreed, saying that despite jurors could not decide whether Ramos was the triggerman, they did their job in a complex trial that hopefully gives the Bologna family, who are in a witness protection program, a fresh start.\par \par \uc2 "This was a horrible incident that destroyed a family and we all collectively hope that this will be the beginning of a new life for the Bologna family and that they can recover and go on with their lives," Gascon said. "The threat against her and her family was very real. We didn't take it lightly and they had to be relocated because of that."\par \par \uc2 Gascon also said his office will not rest until they bring Reyes to justice.\par \par \uc2 Danielle Bologna said during this ordeal that her fallen loved ones have been looking down on her family, especially her son, Andrew Bologna who took the stand during the three-month-old trial and identified Ramos as the gunman.\par \par \uc2 "I'm so proud of him. When you see the courage in this kid who was in that vehicle and had to fight for his family," she said. "He did a damn good job!"\par \par \uc2 Danielle Bologna also said in a written statement released Wednesday that she believes that Ramos was shielded under the city's sanctuary policy and that no one officially still has told her why he was on the streets.\par \par \uc2 Under the sanctuary policy, illegal immigrants charged with crimes as minors were not handed over to federal immigration officials but instead flown home or housed in California at the city's expense.\par \par \uc2 The city has since closed that loophole.\par \par \uc2 Gascon said the issue of immigration is a nationwide problem that needs fixing at a higher level.\par \par \uc2 "I think simply just to say, `Well if we had deported this young man, this crime would not have occurred,'" Gascon said. "I know it has an emotional appeal to it, but I think it doesn't address the real issues here."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120510e85a0008e\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

When it was read, Danielle Bologna, Tony's wife and the mother of their three sons, began sobbing.\par \par \uc2 Several families and friends cheered and cried openly as they heard the decision. Some wore white T-shirts that read "Finally, Justice is Served for the Bologna Family."\par \par \uc2 Andrew Bologna, the only survivor of the attack, testified during Ramos' trial, identifying him as the gunman.\par \par \uc2 Ramos maintained he was only the driver of the car and didn't know his passenger, Wilfredo Reyes, would start shooting. Reyes has not been located.\par \par \uc2 Under the sanctuary policy, illegal immigrants charged with crimes as minors were not handed over to federal immigration officials but instead flown home or housed in California at the city's expense. The city has since closed that loophole.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120509e8590028u\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The autopsy said Hernandez was unresponsive shortly after he was shot with a stun gun, apparently three or four times.\par \par \uc2 Authorities say Hernandez was resisting agents as they were trying to return him to Mexico at San Diego's San Ysidro port of entry, the nation's busiest border crossing. The \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  and longtime San Diego resident had been deported May 25, and the Border Patrol arrested him when he tried to return to the U.S. three days later.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120509e8590026r\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

Patrick\b0\par\par\uc2 647 \uc2 words\par \uc2 8 May 2012\par 19:21\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2012.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 BOSTON (AP) - The U.S. Department of Homeland Security notified state officials Tuesday that despite the objections of Gov. Deval Patrick and immigration activists, they plan to launch a federal program aimed at identifying illegal immigrants arrested for crimes.\par \par \uc2 Massachusetts Public Safety Secretary Mary Beth Heffernan described the Secure Communities program as an information sharing program between federal agencies that can only be implemented by the federal government.\par \par \uc2 Heffernan said the program will have no practical effect on how Massachusetts handles fingerprints and information sharing.\par \par \uc2 "We already send all fingerprints to the federal government and have been doing so for years," Heffernan said. "That practice will continue so we can protect public safety and meet our local law enforcement needs."\par \par \uc2 Patrick said last year that Massachusetts wouldn't participate in the federal program, which checks the immigration status of people who are arrested.\par \par \uc2 "I'm persuaded that here in the commonwealth, we will give up more than we get," the Democratic governor said at the time. "We run a serious risk of ethnic profiling and frankly fracturing incredibly important relationships in communities that are necessary for law enforcement."\par \par \uc2 Supporters of Secure Communities, including Republican U.S. Sen. Scott Brown, say the program is important to help identify illegal immigrants arrested for crimes in Massachusetts.\par \par \uc2 Brown applauded the move Tuesday, calling it "an important tool in keeping our citizens safe and giving our law enforcement officials, especially the sheriffs, the tools and resources they need to do their jobs."\par \par \uc2 "The people of Massachusetts will finally have the protection they deserve from violent criminals who have entered our country illegally," Brown said.\par \par \uc2 Federal officials said the activation of Secure Communities doesn't change a local jurisdiction's existing law enforcement or fingerprinting policies or practices. The only new development is that once the FBI receives the fingerprints, they will send them to the Department of Homeland Security.\par \par \uc2 The fingerprints will be compared to biometric information in the department's immigration databases. When there is a match, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent will determine whether immigration enforcement action would be appropriate.\par \par \uc2 Federal officials said the program doesn't authorize local law enforcement agencies to enforce immigration law or give them any other responsibilities.\par \par \uc2 Immigration officials say all determinations about whether to remove illegal immigrants identified through Secure Communities are made on a case-by-case basis, considering the unique circumstances of each case.\par \par \uc2 Officials say they consider a number of factors such as criminal record, immigration history, family ties, duration of stay in the U.S., and significant medical and mental health issues.\par \par \uc2 Immigration activists say the Secure Communities program seeks to criminalize people just because they don't have the proper documentation to live and work in the U.S.\par \par \uc2 Worcester County Sheriff Lew Evangelidis hailed the decision, pointing to the case of an Ecuadorean man charged with dragging a motorcyclist to his death with his pickup truck in Milford last summer.\par \par \uc2 Nicolas Guaman pleaded not guilty in Worcester Superior Court to a variety of charges including second-degree murder, manslaughter by motor vehicle and motor vehicle homicide while driving negligently and under the influence of alcohol. He was ordered held without bail.\par \par \uc2 Authorities say Guaman is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who was behind the wheel of a pickup truck that struck a motorcycle driven by 23-year-old Matthew Denice.\par \par \uc2 Police allege Guaman drove a quarter of a mile with Denice stuck in the truck's wheel well, even as witnesses banged on the vehicle begging him to pull over.\par \par \uc2 "Following the tragic death of Matthew, I made a promise to his family that I would do everything in my power to bring this program to Massachusetts so that other families would not have to endure the pain they suffered," Evangelidis said Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120508e85800284\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc78}{\*\bkmkend toc78}\b \uc2 Obama campaign buys Spanish language ads while Romney works to reclaim ground with Hispanics\b0\par\par\uc2 By BETH FOUHY   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 714 \uc2 words\par \uc2 8 May 2012\par 16:33\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2012.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 NEW YORK (AP) - President Barack Obama's re-election campaign launched a series of Spanish-language television ads in three battleground states on Tuesday. Separately, a Republican official stated that Mitt Romney is "still deciding" his position on immigration, then backtracked. Taken together, the ads and the comment underscored the Democrat's advantages and his Republican opponent's challenge in wooing the nation's fastest-growing ethnic group, Democratic-leaning Hispanics.\par \par \uc2 The Obama campaign ads, promoting the president's federal health care overhaul, are running in Florida, Nevada and Colorado, states with large Hispanic populations. Obama carried the three against Republican John McCain in 2008, and polling shows a tight contest again this election.\par \par \uc2 The Spanish-language commercials are running as part of a nine-state, $25 million advertising effort the Obama team unveiled this week. The campaign had previously spent $850,000 on Spanish-language ads in the same three states to promote Obama's education policies, according to Smart Media Group, which tracks political ad spending.\par \par \uc2 Obama won 67 percent of Hispanic voters to McCain's 31 percent in 2008. Polling shows Obama continues to have a wide lead among Hispanics, even as the limping economy has weakened his position among other demographic groups he carried in the last election.\par \par \uc2 A Pew Research Center poll taken last month found 67 percent of Hispanic voters backed Obama, compared to 27 percent for Romney. A Quinnipiac University poll also taken last month found a similar result -- Obama led Romney by a margin of 64-24 percent.\par \par \uc2 Romney, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee, took hardline positions on immigration issues during the contentious Republican nominating contest. He said he would veto the so-called DREAM Act, which would allow the children of illegal immigrants to enroll in college or the military and eventually establish citizenship or permanent residency in the U.S. He also urged a reduction of benefits for illegal immigrants to push them to "self-deport" and praised a controversial Arizona law that allows police to ask about the immigration status of anyone they stop.\par \par \uc2 Romney has already signaled he'll consider policies that may not line up with opinions expressed during the primary. In April he said his campaign was evaluating a conservative alternative to the DREAM Act proposed by Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. The legislation would allow some \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students to receive visas that would permit them to stay in the U.S. legally for some period of time.\par \par \uc2 The Romney campaign aired Spanish-language ads in Florida before that state's primary in January but has not run any since. The Republican-leaning super PAC American Crossroads ran Spanish-language ads criticizing Obama in several battleground states in 2011 but has not done so this year.\par \par \uc2 Republican officials at a news briefing Tuesday in Washington acknowledged the hurdles the party faces with Hispanics. The party has named Hispanic outreach directors in six swing states -- Colorado, Florida, New Mexico, Nevada, North Carolina and Virginia.\par \par \uc2 Bettina Inclan, the Republican National Committee's Hispanic outreach director, appeared to compound Romney's challenge by suggesting that he hadn't developed a clear position on immigration.\par \par \uc2 "I think as a candidate, to my understanding, he's still deciding what his position on immigration is. I can't talk about what his position is going to be," Inclan said.\par \par \uc2 Inclan quickly took to Twitter to say she had misspoken. "Romney's position on immigration is clear," she tweeted.\par \par \uc2 Romney campaign spokesman Albert Martinez released a statement criticizing Obama on immigration.\par \par \uc2 "President Obama broke his promise to Hispanics on immigration reform, Americans still oppose his healthcare takeover, more Hispanics have been plunged into poverty as a result of his weak leadership on the economy, and his $800 billion stimulus failed to stem the jobs crisis in the Hispanic community. With a record like that, President Obama has no choice but to spend millions of dollars trying to spin his failed leadership and broken promises," Martinez said.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press Deputy Polling Director Jennifer Agiesta and Associated Press writer Kasie Hunt in Washington contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 Follow Beth Fouhy on Twitter at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.twitter.com/bfouhy"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.twitter.com/bfouhy}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120508e8580021c\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

PAULSON   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 388 \uc2 words\par \uc2 8 May 2012\par 17:05\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2012.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 DENVER (AP) - A federal appeals court has rejected an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 's claim that the Second Amendment guarantees him the right to bear firearms.\par \par \uc2 Emmanuel Huitron-Guizar of Gillette, Wyo., had argued that illegal aliens are guaranteed certain other rights by the U.S. Constitution, such as the right to due process. The Second Amendment provides that "the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed," and Huitron-Guizar argued he was part of "the people."\par \par \uc2 But the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver ruled that Huitron-Guizar fell under the Gun Control Act of 1968, which forbids gun possession by nine classes of individuals, including illegal aliens. It conceded there is some argument about the meaning of "the people" and U.S. citizens -- but found that Congress had lawfully exercised its power to distinguish between citizens and non-citizens.\par \par \uc2 "That Congress saw fit to exclude illegal aliens from carrying guns may indicate its belief, entitled to our respect, that such aliens, as a class, possess no such constitutional right," the court said.\par \par \uc2 Huitron-Guizar, 24, was born in Mexico, brought to Wyoming at the age of 3, and never obtained U.S. citizenship. In March 2011, officers served a search warrant at his home and found a rifle, a 12-gauge semi-automatic shotgun and a semi-automatic pistol.\par \par \uc2 He entered a conditional guilty plea to being an illegal alien in possession of firearms transported or shipped in interstate commerce. He was sentenced to 18 months in prison and is to be deported thereafter.\par \par \uc2 Huitron-Guizar's attorney, Ronald Pretty, said Tuesday he believed such cases involving constitutional definitions of "people" as opposed to "citizens" could end up before the U.S. Supreme Court.\par \par \uc2 The circuit court of appeals did find the Constitution did not clearly define U.S. citizenship.\par \par \uc2 "We know, for instance, that the founders' notion of citizenship was less rigid than ours, largely tied to the franchise, which itself was often based on little more than a brief period of residence and being a male with some capital," the panel noted.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Online:\par \par \uc2 Appeals Court Ruling: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.ca10.uscourts.gov/opinions/11/11-8051.pdf"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.ca10.uscourts.gov/opinions/11/11-8051.pdf}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120508e858001i1\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 GILBERT, Ariz. (AP) - Many considered Jason Todd Ready to be the most high-profile neo-Nazi in Arizona. He led groups of heavily armed civilians into the desert to look for illegal immigrants as he repeatedly tried to win public office.\par \par \uc2 But Ready's beliefs and actions got so extreme, including statements that land mines would be a good way to stop border crossers, that the state's most conservative politicians distanced themselves from him.\par \par \uc2 Unwelcome among Republicans, Ready ran in January for sheriff as a Democrat. He continued to lead immigration patrols and posted \uc2 Facebook\uc2  updates, but there was little to suggest his personal life was in turmoil.\par \par \uc2 On Wednesday, police said, Ready, a burly 39-year-old who went by "JT," shot and killed four people, including a 16-month-old girl, in the Phoenix suburb of Gilbert where he lived. He then turned the gun on himself.\par \par \uc2 The dead included Lisa Lynn Mederos, 47, who is believed to be Ready's girlfriend; her daughter Amber Nieve Mederos, 23; and Amber's boyfriend, Jim Franklin Hiott, 24. The child was found alive but was pronounced dead at a hospital.\par \par \uc2 A teenager in the house heard arguing followed by gunshots, Gilbert police Sgt. Bill Balafas said. She came out of a back room, found the bodies and called 911.\par \par \uc2 Balafas said the evidence suggests a domestic dispute, but that investigators aren't sure what triggered it.\par \par \uc2 Officers had been called to the home previously for domestic disputes, Balafas said. He had no details of those calls or if they involved Ready and said the reports on the disputes would not be released for days.\par \par \uc2 The killings and Ready's involvement stunned members of his group, the U.S. Border Guard.\par \par \uc2 "Our sympathies go out to all of his family and friends during this time of unbelievable grief and pain," according to a statement posted on its website. "God bless you, J.T. You will be fiercely missed."\par \par \uc2 Harry Hughes, a regional director for the National Socialist Movement who went out on patrols with Ready, said the shooting was "completely out of character" for Ready.\par \par \uc2 "And I'm going to not speculate or make any conclusions. I'm going to let the investigation go take its course," Hughes said. "But I have a real hard time believing that JT Ready could actually shoot and kill a child."\par \par \uc2 Anti-hate groups such as the Southern Poverty Law Center have for years tracked Ready. "JT Ready was a violent thug who typifies the very worst element in the American nativist movement," said the SPLC's Mark Potok.\par \par \uc2 According to an SPLC profile on its website, Ready was court-martialed twice in 1996 while serving in the U.S. Marine Corps, the first time after being gone for eight days without permission.\par \par \uc2 The center said Ready was demoted to private after the absence, jailed for three months and that, later that year, was court-martialed again for conspiracy, assault and wrongful solicitation and advice. He was found guilty, spent six months in detention and was discharged for bad conduct, the center said.\par \par \uc2 The Marine Corps was trying to confirm the center's information.\par \par \uc2 Ready's ex-wife, Arline Lindgren, knew that he had started associating with white supremacist groups when they were married in the late 1990s, her brother, Adam Lindgren, said. The couple divorced in 2003.\par \par \uc2 Lindgren said he got into a few arguments with Ready but that they were never violent. He said Ready had a temper, but "not a violent temper, that I was aware of." He said he never saw Ready be violent toward anybody.\par \par \uc2 Ready was "very, very opinionated. He would argue with you until ... well, just keep arguing with you," he said.\par \par \uc2 Ready was a member of the Detroit-based National Socialist Movement, whose members promote white separatism, dress like Nazis and display swastikas. It believes only non-Jewish, white heterosexuals should be American citizens and that everyone who isn't white should leave the country "peacefully or by force."\par \par \uc2 Ready first tried to get into politics in 2004, when he unsuccessfully ran for a seat in the Arizona House. In 2006, he lost a run for Mesa city council but was later elected as a Republican precinct committeeman.\par \par \uc2 He didn't run for re-election in 2008 after three Republican congressmen wrote a letter to a GOP county chairman asking for his removal because of his neo-Nazi ties. They said Ready was sullying the party's image. They said he was a featured speaker at a neo-Nazi conference in Omaha, Neb., in September 2007 and distributed racist and anti-Semitic literature at a GOP meeting.\par \par \uc2 Trying to distance himself from the movement, Ready told The Arizona Republic in 2010 that he left the group. Potok said the move was "merely for cosmetic reasons."\par \par \uc2 Ready was also running his desert operations targeting illegal immigrants, one of which was featured on the National Socialist Movement's website as recently as January. Some of the photos on the website match ones posted to his \uc2 Facebook\uc2  page.\par \par \uc2 They include images of Ready and other members wearing head-to-toe camouflage gear, helmets and boots, and carrying high-powered guns during a weekend operation ending Jan. 29. The group claimed to help the U.S. Border Patrol apprehend one \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "Some of us have our fingers on the triggers," Ready wrote in a post on a website for his group. "Soap box. Ballot Box. Ammo box. These were given to us by our founding fathers and mothers. We have just about depleted the first two options."\par \par \uc2 Hughes defended Ready's desert operations, saying the primary focus of his group was to find and report drug smuggling.\par \par \uc2 "And from time to time, we would find human smuggling. We would find stranded motorists. We would find illegal aliens that were stuck out in the desert without water," he said. "We actually saved about two dozen lives out there the last two years -- people who would be dead today if we hadn't come across them," he said.\par \par \uc2 In January, Ready announced that he wanted to become sheriff in Pinal County, a sprawling area southeast of Phoenix that includes large swaths of desert that serve as a corridor for human and drug smugglers. Ready listed himself as a Democrat in his paperwork, and most considered his chances of being elected laughable. They speculated that he wanted some media attention.\par \par \uc2 At the time, Joe Robison, chair of the Pinal County Democrats, said Ready was too much of an extremist to get elected. "I don't think there's a snowball's chance in hell of getting him elected," Robison said.\par \par \uc2 Former Arizona Rep. Russell Pearce, the chief architect of some of the state's tough legislation against illegal immigrants, was once Ready's political ally and friend, but said in a statement that he distanced himself after learning of his ties to white supremacists.\par \par \uc2 "At some point in time, darkness took his life over," he said.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writers Terry Tang in Gilbert, Ariz., and Michelle Price in Phoenix and Carson Walker in Maricopa, Ariz. contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120503e8530000x\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

(AP) - An \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  involved in a crash that killed a high school student can't be charged solely because he was driving with an expired Mexican license.\par \par \uc2 The Michigan appeals court agrees with an Ingham County judge, who said state law doesn't fit in the death of Adam Nevells. His car was hit as he pulled out of the parking lot at Okemos High School in 2009.\par \par \uc2 There's no evidence of negligence by the other driver, Valeriano Acosta-Bautista. But the Ingham County prosecutor charged him with causing death while driving with a suspended or revoked license. Attorneys say Acosta-Bautista's license was expired, not suspended or revoked. They cite an agreement between the U.S. and Mexico to honor licenses in both countries.\par \par \uc2 Acosta-Bautista no longer lives in the U.S.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120502e852001py\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 A look at how Congress has dealt with immigration in the past 25 years:\par \par \uc2 1986: The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 both tightens controls on illegal immigration and extends amnesty for many illegal immigrants. It requires that employers attest to employees' immigration status and make it illegal to hire or recruit illegal immigrants. It also grants amnesty to some seasonal agricultural workers and to illegal immigrants who entered the United States prior to 1982 and have lived in the country continuously.\par \par \uc2 1990: The Immigration Act of 1990 created a lottery program that randomly assigned a number of visas, and increased the number of immigrants allowed into the country each year. The law also included exceptions for the English-language portion of the naturalization test.\par \par \uc2 1996: Under President Bill Clinton, several pieces of legislation are enacted that crack down on various facets of immigration. Specifically, there is a sharp increase in the categories of criminal activity for which immigrants, including permanent residents, can be deported. The laws also impose mandatory detention for certain types of deportation cases, and as a result deportation rates skyrocket.\par \par \uc2 Sept. 11, 2001: Terrorists attack New York and Washington, D.C., killing nearly 3,000 people. The events put immigration under a microscope because the attackers were foreigners, and change the way many politicians and Americans view immigration.

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc88}{\*\bkmkend toc88}\b \uc2 Fizzled protests, mixed messages, indicative of state of stalled immigration reform movement\b0\par\par\uc2 By KATE BRUMBACK and PETER PRENGAMAN   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 1,010 \uc2 words\par \uc2 2 May 2012\par 14:53\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2012.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ATLANTA (AP) - While a black preacher told about 100 immigration protesters that incarcerated blacks and detained immigrants faced similar challenges, Jesse Morgan stood to one side of the May Day demonstrators, holding a large sign that read "Radical Queers Resist."\par \par \uc2 Although the rally was geared toward illegal immigrants, the 24-year-old Georgia State sociology major said gays can relate, too, because they often face discrimination.\par \par \uc2 "And besides," he said. "There are queers who are undocumented."\par \par \uc2 Over the last several years, May Day rallies in the United States have been dominated by activists pushing for a path to citizenship for the estimated 11 million people in the country illegally. But since 2006, when hundreds of thousands took to the streets in cities across America, the rallies have gotten smaller, less focused and increasingly splintered by any number of groups with a cause.\par \par \uc2 In New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Oakland, Calif., May Day protests were dominated by Occupy Wall Street activists, a sign of how far the immigration reform movement has fallen off the radar, unable to compete with the weak economy.\par \par \uc2 Immigration activists say they are not worried about decreasing numbers at rallies because their focus the last few years has been more on getting eligible immigrants to become U.S. citizens and vote.\par \par \uc2 And yet activists acknowledge the threat to illegal immigrants may be stronger than ever with the U.S. Supreme Court considering Arizona's tough, controversial crackdown. In 2010, Arizona passed a law that, among other things, required police to ask for immigration papers from anyone they stop or arrest and suspect is in the country illegally. The Obama administration has challenged the law.\par \par \uc2 The court's ruling could have a far-reaching effect on a handful of states, including Georgia, that have similar laws.\par \par \uc2 Gustavo Madrigal, a 20-year-old \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who attended the Atlanta May Day rally, said he keeps attending the rallies because he has "always been taught that an American doesn't give up."\par \par \uc2 Madrigal, who came from Mexico with his parents when he was 9, is applying for scholarships and doing fundraisers in an attempt to raise $59,000 to go to Hampshire College in Massachusetts.\par \par \uc2 "I'm not asking for a handout, free housing or health care. I just want a chance," he said.\par \par \uc2 Since the last major immigration reform in 1986, which extended amnesty to millions here illegally, activism has ebbed and flowed.\par \par \uc2 Proposition 187, passed by California voters in 1994, prohibited illegal immigrants from using social services, including health care and education. The law was eventually thrown out, but it angered many Latinos and helped make California a solidly Democratic state.\par \par \uc2 In 2005, a bill passed by the U.S. House of Representatives that would have criminalized anyone who helped illegal immigrants also had a galvanizing effect. For several months in 2006, hundreds of thousands rallied across the country. The U.S. Senate responded, passing a reform bill that would have given a path to citizenship for millions here illegally.\par \par \uc2 As is often the norm with immigration, however, the result was paralysis.\par \par \uc2 As years have turned to decades, immigration activists have had to accept the reality that it could be a long time before Congress deals with the issue.\par \par \uc2 President Barack Obama's election win in 2008 represented arguably the best hope in a generation for so-called comprehensive reform: combining better border security and a crackdown on \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  workers with a way for millions here illegally to come out of the shadows and stay.\par \par \uc2 However, even with Democrats controlling both the House and Senate, they couldn't pass immigration reform as health care reform and the economy took center stage. After Democrats took a beating in the 2010 elections, immigration reform had become all but taboo.\par \par \uc2 "We have been given so much lip service that our lips are sore," said Jorge-Mario Cabrera, a spokesman for the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights in Los Angeles.\par \par \uc2 Cabrera acknowledged that the immigration reform movement was at a low point, with few prospects for change in the near future. Many believe that for major reform to happen, millions more Latinos needed to become U.S. citizens and vote.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, for illegal immigrants, daily life has gotten harder. Deportations under Obama have gone up sharply. The annual average since 2009 is around 400,000, about 30 percent higher than under President George W. Bush, according to the \uc2 Pew Hispanic Center\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 There are also strong indications that fewer immigrants are trying to come to America, and others have gone home.\par \par \uc2 "Sometimes it feels like every day is like a risk," said Eduardo Villegas, a 38-year-old \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who came to Georgia in the mid-90s, drawn by the construction boom that preceded the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta.\par \par \uc2 People pushing for tougher immigration laws and enforcement say the heightened fear in immigrant communities is proof that the tide is turning.\par \par \uc2 "Every day without a repeat of the 1986 amnesty is a victory for the majority of Americans," said D.A. King, a proponent of Georgia's enforcement-focused immigration law passed in 2011. "The pro-enforcement side is winning, but it isn't pretty."\par \par \uc2 States have increasingly taken matters into their own hands. After Arizona passed its law, several states followed with similar laws.\par \par \uc2 Tamar Jacoby, president of ImmigrationWorks USA, a national federation of small business owners working for immigration reform, said that might be a good thing. While most state-initiated laws focus on enforcement, eventually there may be more progressive experiments on other facets of immigration such as temporary workers programs.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, Jacoby says some in Congress are starting to approach immigration in a piecemeal fashion instead of trying to create an all-encompassing reform.\par \par \uc2 "Maybe the model is to fix some small pieces, take those off the table, show Democrats and Republicans can work together, and then move on to bigger things," she said.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120502e852000ro\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 CHICAGO (AP) - Activists from the Occupy and immigration rights movements joined forces Tuesday for a noisy but peaceful May Day march and rally in Chicago, regarded by many as a dress rehearsal for what's expected to be an even larger protest during the NATO summit in three weeks.\par \par \uc2 About 2,000 people marched from Chicago's near West Side to Federal Plaza downtown, where a smaller crowd rallied to demand immigration reform and greater protections for workers, as police on bicycles, horseback and foot looked on. Police said there were no arrests, and estimated the rally's crowd at about 1,000.\par \par \uc2 May 1 -- International Workers Day -- is a traditional date for political demonstrations.\par \par \uc2 Although the May 1 rally has been geared toward immigrant rights in recent years, organizers said they welcomed participation from Occupy groups as they try to reinvigorate the demonstrations. Many of Chicago's most vocal immigrant rights groups have been participating in the Occupy movement.\par \par \uc2 "I definitely see it as an enrichment of it," said Orlando Sepulveda, a Chicago organizer. "It's great."\par \par \uc2 Participation in the May Day events has plummeted since 2006, when nearly half a million in Chicago marched to protest federal legislation that would have made being an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  a felony. The legislation ultimately failed. Since then, the numbers have fallen to a few thousand, as activists failed to unite behind a single cause. Some have focused on voter registration and politics, while others have focused on workers' rights.\par \par \uc2 Organizers of the NATO protests distributed leaflets urging May Day demonstrators to show up on May 20. They say the U.S. is spending trillions of dollars on unnecessary wars while people at home are unemployed and suffering from government cutbacks.\par \par \uc2 It was difficult to gauge how many May Day protesters might join the activists during NATO.\par \par \uc2 Gary Jones of Joliet, who said he came downtown with his guide dog, Cuddles, "to make the aristocrats sweat," also plans to join the anti-NATO protest.\par \par \uc2 "I'm against war, so I hope that draws a big crowd, too," Jones said.\par \par \uc2 But Chicago bricklayer Juan Munoz, who rallied for labor rights and immigration reform, said he's not sure if he or fellow members of the \uc2 Chicago Federation of Labor\uc2  will come out for NATO.\par \par \uc2 "I just don't know," he said.\par \par \uc2 Earlier in the day, about 50 Occupy Chicago activists rallied outside a \uc2 Bank of America\uc2  branch downtown to protest what they said were bank profits over the needs of ordinary people, and to decry \uc2 Bank of America\uc2 's federal bailout.\par \par \uc2 Dozens of police blocked the doorway and street by placing their bicycles end to end. Protesters left after about an hour to join immigrant rights groups at Union Park for the May Day march.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writer Sophia Tareen contributed to this story.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120502e8520003b\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Amarillo Globe-News. April 26, 2012.\par \par \uc2 Clinton is right: Ideology can hurt\par \par \uc2 Few political observers have compared the 42nd president of the United States with the 36th.\par \par \uc2 But what former President Bill Clinton intoned this week at West Texas A&M University well might have brought back memories of the late President Lyndon Johnson.\par \par \uc2 It is this, quite simply: Rigid ideology must not stop progress on behalf of the country.\par \par \uc2 Clinton, speaking as part of WT's Distinguished Lecture Series, told a packed First United Bank Event Center Tuesday night that "we can do lots of stuff to grow the economy, but if we spend most of our time making ideological arguments ... we're not having the right debate. We're talking about whether to do something, instead of how to do it."\par \par \uc2 Bingo, Mr. President.\par \par \uc2 Clinton helped craft a successful presidency from 1993 until 2001 by working with congressional Republicans who took control of Congress after the landmark 1994 mid-term election. The president's tax policies, coupled with GOP-led spending restraints, helped bring about a balanced budget for several years running.\par \par \uc2 Does that remind anyone of LBJ? It should.\par \par \uc2 The Texan also worked well with congressional Republicans. Some of his better friends in the Senate were the likes of the late Republican Sen. Everett Dirksen of Illinois, with whom he had a tremendous working relationship, owing in part to LBJ's own time as Senate majority leader. Johnson would fight publicly with Republicans, then work privately with them on ways to reach compromise.\par \par \uc2 That kind of "back-room dealing" has been missing in recent years. It has resulted in stalemate after stalemate in Congress, with both sides blaming each other for the other side's intransigence, stubborn adherence to ideology and an inability to think of the common good.\par \par \uc2 People get elected all the time by professing to hold to their principles. It falls on those elected officials to ensure their principles jibe with those of a majority of their constituents. It also falls on them to determine how and when to work toward compromise without surrendering their ideology.\par \par \uc2 It's a complicated process at times, which is the very nature of legislating.\par \par \uc2 Clinton gets it.\par \par \uc2 So did Johnson.\par \par \uc2 And so should those who serve the nation today.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Houston Chronicle. April 28, 2012.\par \par \uc2 Take a breath, and look again at immigration reform\par \par \uc2 Mexican President Felipe Calderon's visit to Houston almost exactly coincided with the \uc2 Pew Hispanic Center\uc2 's announcement that Mexican immigration to the U.S. has "ground to a halt". The dramatic drop in the immigration flow is good for both countries, as President Calderon explained. Immigration, he said, "breaks up families, we lose productivity, we lose leaders."\par \par \uc2 Some of the drop in immigration is based on our weak economy. But our job shortage is not the whole story. The Mexican economy has improved greatly during President Calderon's tenure, which ends this December.\par \par \uc2 As the Chronicle reported, the Mexican economy "grew by 4 percent last year and more than 600,000 jobs were created." Mexican wages have also improved significantly over the years. These are numbers that many countries might envy.\par \par \uc2 It's worth keeping these changing immigration patterns in mind as we also consider Arizona's very tough anti-\uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2  law, which was just argued before the Supreme Court. Many observers expect the court to uphold large parts of the law, despite the fact that critics -- including a prominent Arizona sheriff -- call it an invitation to racial profiling.\par \par \uc2 Perhaps we're overly optimistic, but we'd like to think that even the law's proponents look at it as a stopgap measure, perhaps even a desperate one. So maybe the news from Mexico points to the way forward on long-delayed but critically needed immigration reform. If Mexicans workers continue to return home, perhaps the U.S.-and the states -- can begin thinking about what sensible reform would look like -- the type of reform that President George W. Bush wanted to pursue before 9/11.\par \par \uc2 The day will come again when we need immigrant workers in fields like home construction. That need has never gone away when it comes to agriculture -- just ask the Alabama farmers who have seen their crops rot in the fields due to a lack of both immigrant labor and willing U.S. workers. The U.S. critically needs a legal guest- worker program that ensures all workers conform to U.S. law, and at the same time protects everyone's human rights and dignity.\par \par \uc2 We're not so optimistic that we expect concrete progress during an election year. Let's just plant a seed that willing workers can later harvest.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 The Dallas Morning News. April 27, 2012.\par \par \uc2 Salute to Connecticut on death ban\par \par \uc2 In many corners of the nation, it was heartening news this week that Connecticut Gov. Dannel P. Malloy signed a bill outlawing the death sentence as an option for juries. His became the fifth state in five years to eliminate capital punishment, reflecting growing uneasiness about imposing an irrevocable punishment in light of deep flaws that continue to be exposed in the justice system.\par \par \uc2 Malloy didn't come to his decision as a reform zealot or overcome by compassion. That's important. His perspective is that of a former prosecutor who once built cases against criminals, killers included.\par \par \uc2 In time he saw how a well-meaning system of justice broke down despite the efforts and training of honest people. The DNA-driven scientific revolution has pulled the curtain back, and it's impossible in good conscience to ignore the truth and defend state-sponsored killing.\par \par \uc2 Eyewitnesses are mistaken. Forensic evidence is misread or misinterpreted. Innocent people admit things they didn't do. Innocent people end up with bad lawyers and cut bad deals. Innocent people go to death row.\par \par \uc2 Still, defenders of the death penalty constitute a majority in polls, especially in Texas, but also in Connecticut, where a new survey showed a 2-1 margin in favor. We salute political leaders such as Malloy who take a principled stand against the death penalty despite the political risk.\par \par \uc2 That's not where enough Texas politicians are today, and it's a sad wonder. Texas is the epicenter of DNA exonerations, and stories of slipshod and corrupt prosecution curdle the blood. Despite this, Texas continues to have the nation's most active execution chamber since reinstatement of the death penalty, with more than 480 executions since 1976. But there is encouraging evidence that even in Texas prosecutors are losing eagerness to add to Texas' death row: Just 10 executions were scheduled this year -- less than half the annual average of 22 people executed in Huntsville over the past decade.\par \par \uc2 Many of our fellow Texans who favor capital punishment do so in the belief it deters crime. Former Gov. George W. Bush, for example, once said: "I don't think you should support the death penalty to seek revenge. I don't think that's right. I think the reason to support the death penalty is because it saves other people's lives."\par \par \uc2 To our fellow Texans who agree, we urge a pause to test assumptions. A study recently released by the National Research Council analyzed research on the deterrent effect of the death penalty since 1976 and came away with this: There is not enough evidence for or against the proposition that capital punishment actually prevents murder.\par \par \uc2 With reason to suspect one of its core justifications, should the death penalty forever hold sway among Texans as a defining element of our justice system? We hope the time is drawing near that most people say no.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Fort Worth Star-Telegram. April 24, 2012.\par \par \uc2 Mental health treatment delays hurt military veterans\par \par \uc2 If a military veteran went to the hospital with an obvious wound, it's natural to expect that treatment would commence without delay.\par \par \uc2 But not every war injury is immediately apparent or visible to the untrained eye.\par \par \uc2 With the wind-down of military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, thousands of the returning troops are seeking care for mental-health issues stemming from their service experiences.\par \par \uc2 But the Veterans Affairs Department's inspector general says many of those vets aren't being seen as quickly as they should be -- and the VA's flawed tracking system gives a false picture of the problem's magnitude.\par \par \uc2 Even though the \uc2 Veterans Health Administration\uc2  reported in 2011 that 95 percent of veterans received a comprehensive mental exam within 14 days of requesting one (the time frame in agency policy), the actual number was 49 percent, the inspector general reported Monday. It took an average of 50 days to provide a full evaluation for the rest, the report said.\par \par \uc2 "\uc2 VHA\uc2  does not have a reliable and accurate method of determining whether they are providing patients timely access to mental health care services," the inspector general said.\par \par \uc2 Part of the problem is with the way records are kept: Schedulers don't always follow the rules, and the lag between referral by a primary care physician and the evaluation might not be reflected properly.\par \par \uc2 Part of the problem is a shortage of personnel, particularly psychiatrists. Officials knew the data-keeping was problematic; the inspector general pointed it out in reports in 2005 and 2007.\par \par \uc2 They also knew of the growing staffing needs and, in fact, increased personnel 46 percent from 2005 to 2010, the report said. But in an informal survey of VA mental-health professionals, requested by Congress, 71 percent of those responding said their centers didn't have enough people to keep up. A veteran seeking treatment at the VA medical center in Salisbury, N.C., for instance, had to wait 86 days to see a psychiatrist, the IG said.\par \par \uc2 "Getting our veterans timely mental health care can quite frankly often be the difference between life and death," said Sen. Patty Murray, a Washington state Democrat who heads the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee. "It's the critical period, not unlike the `golden hour' immediately after a traumatic physical injury."\par \par \uc2 Indeed, the report cited studies in nonmilitary settings showing that delays in initially screening for mental-health needs tend to discourage patients from keeping appointments and following through with treatment.\par \par \uc2 The Veterans' Affairs Committee has scheduled a hearing for this morning titled "VA Mental Health Care: Evaluating Access and Assessing Care."\par \par \uc2 Murray said the report "shows that the VA is failing many of those who have been brave enough to seek care. It is hard enough to get veterans into the VA system to receive mental-health care. Once a veteran takes the step to reach out for help, we need to knock down every potential barrier to care."\par \par \uc2 Last week, Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki said the department will add 1,600 mental-health clinicians, including nurses, psychiatrists, psychologists and social workers, plus 300 support workers. The Texas network of facilities will receive 140 new mental-health positions, a spokeswoman said, but it's not certain how many will go to the Fort Worth Outpatient Clinic or the Dallas VA Medical Center.\par \par \uc2 Last year alone, the VA provided mental-health services to 1.3 million veterans, the agency said.\par \par \uc2 Of the 111,000 veterans served in Dallas, 25 percent receive mental-health care; of the 29,000 vets treated at the Fort Worth clinic, about 30 percent receive mental-health services. A spokeswoman said Tuesday that patients at the North Texas facilities get initial mental-health assessments and emergency services the day they seek them, though there might be a wait to start specific programs. The hospitals are working to improve their services and wait-time tracking, local officials said.\par \par \uc2 "History shows that the costs of war will continue to grow for a decade or more after the operational missions in Iraq and Afghanistan have ended," Shinseki said.\par \par \uc2 It's an obligation the American public has to those who've served, and it must be fulfilled as diligently as they served us.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 The Beaumont Enterprise. April 26, 2012.\par \par \uc2 Neches River needs scenic designation\par \par \uc2 The Neches River would benefit if Congress approves a proposal to study whether a key segment of it should be designated as a Wild and Scenic River. A bill by Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison would focus on the 225-mile stretch between Steinhagen Lake in Jasper County and Lake Palestine in Anderson and Cherokee counties.\par \par \uc2 The proposal makes sense because it contains a lot of flexibility. It would study whether the river needed protection and if so, whether the designation would be the best way to do that. Then, some or all of that segment could be protected.\par \par \uc2 Some industrial interests in the region are cool to the idea because they are concerned that the designation could limit future development along the river or use of its water. Although the designation would prohibit the building of any dams, it would not otherwise halt development or affect landowners.\par \par \uc2 That's reasonable, and this study should proceed.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120501e851001id\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

Anita Shaw, the victim's mother, was serving in Iraq when her son was killed.\par \par \uc2 Shaw's parents unsuccessfully sued the county, arguing that Espinoza was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who should have been turned over to federal authorities.\par \par \uc2 They also mounted an unsuccessful petition drive to pass a law enabling police to arrest \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  gang members and hand them over to federal authorities.\par \par \uc2 He faces a possible death sentence if he's convicted.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120501e851000c1\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc93}{\*\bkmkend toc93}\b \uc2 Kan. lawmakers' immigration debate still stalled, even as US Supreme Court seems receptive\b0\par\par\uc2 By JOHN HANNA   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 810 \uc2 words\par \uc2 30 April 2012\par 11:14\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2012.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) - Kris Kobach and other Kansas officials who want the state to crack down on illegal immigration are encouraged by public comments from U.S. Supreme Court justices, which suggest they're ready to uphold major parts of a tough Arizona law Kobach helped draft.\par \par \uc2 But Kobach, the Kansas secretary of state, acknowledges that he and his legislative allies also must overcome opposition from influential business groups and a rift among Republicans.\par \par \uc2 The GOP's split over immigration has prevented legislation from passing -- proposals favored by Kobach and a plan from a business coalition that includes the powerful \uc2 Kansas Chamber of Commerce\uc2  to create a state program to place some illegal immigrants in hard-to-fill jobs. Kobach and legislators don't expect the stalemate to be broken before lawmakers adjourn.\par \par \uc2 Kobach, a Republican and a former law professor known nationally for advising officials in other states on immigration, believes the U.S. Supreme Court will uphold much or all of the Arizona law and spur a wave of legislation next year. But it is this year's legislative elections that will determine whether Kansas joins the trend, he said.\par \par \uc2 "One thing we know, and that is that lots of legislators will walk their districts again," Kobach told The Associated Press during an interview. "I am absolutely 100 percent certain that immigration will be one of the top two or three things."\par \par \uc2 The U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments last week on a legal challenge to the Arizona law from President Barack Obama's administration. The 2010 law requires police officers to check the immigration status of people they suspect are in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 When Obama's solicitor general argued that Arizona improperly infringed upon the federal government's authority to set immigration policy, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Sonia Sotomayor were skeptical. Roberts said the state simply wanted to notify federal authorities of possible illegal immigrants, and Sotomayor commented, "You can see it's not selling very well."\par \par \uc2 A proposal for a similar law in Kansas is stuck in a House committee, along with two other measures. One would make it a crime to knowingly harbor an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , and the other would require state and local government contractors to use the federal E-Verify database to check whether new employees are in the U.S. legally.\par \par \uc2 A narrower E-Verify bill cleared a committee in the House, but Speaker Mike O'Neal, a Hutchinson Republican, refused to schedule a debate. He didn't think he could prevent a debate on tougher measures -- or the business coalition's proposal -- and told fellow Republicans he wanted to avoid a "bloody" dispute that would split his party's huge majority.\par \par \uc2 "If there is going to be something, I want something that gets broad support," O'Neal said last week. "There's much more to this issue than, `What part of illegal don't you understand?' "\par \par \uc2 O'Neal and Kobach said legislators will want to examine the high court's decision on the Arizona law instead of relying on justices' public comments. The Legislature expects to adjourn by mid-May, weeks before the court is expected to rule.\par \par \uc2 Rep. Anthony Brown, a Eudora Republican, said legislators should concentrate on an E-Verify bill.\par \par \uc2 "Some of the other stuff, I don't think, is going to get through the system anyway, in the current makeup of the Legislature," he said.\par \par \uc2 Senate Majority Leader Jay Emler, a Lindsborg Republican, said lawmakers simply don't have enough time left in a session that's crowded with other issues, such as cutting taxes, approving a budget and redrawing political boundaries.\par \par \uc2 The Senate's GOP leaders have been cool to immigration proposals favored by Kobach, but their hold on the chamber will be tested by primary challenges. All 40 Senate seats and 125 House seats are on the ballot this year, but Kobach said immigration legislation is "entirely dependent" on what happens in the Senate races.\par \par \uc2 "Fighting pitched battles in the House is futile when everybody knows that the Senate is going to kill it anyway," Kobach said.\par \par \uc2 Kobach, who traveled to Washington to observe the arguments in front of the U.S. Supreme Court, was confident the court will uphold most, if not all, of the Arizona law. Emler, however, believes Kobach's prediction is "pure conjecture."\par \par \uc2 Eric Stafford\uc2 , a state chamber lobbyist, acknowledged that even if the court rules as Kobach expects, the secretary of state and his allies will still face concerns that their proposals will harm the economy by leaving some industries, including agriculture, with worker shortages.\par \par \uc2 "Regardless of the outcome, we need to encourage the federal government to do something," Stafford said. "Comprehensive immigration reform isn't just enforcement."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120430e84u001b7\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc94}{\*\bkmkend toc94}\b \uc2 Kan. lawmakers' immigration debate still stalled, even as US Supreme Court seems receptive\b0\par\par\uc2 By JOHN HANNA   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 836 \uc2 words\par \uc2 29 April 2012\par 13:52\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2012.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) - Kris Kobach and other Kansas officials who want the state to crack down on illegal immigration are encouraged by public comments from U.S. Supreme Court justices, which suggest they're ready to uphold major parts of a tough Arizona law Kobach helped draft.\par \par \uc2 But Kobach, the Kansas secretary of state, acknowledges that he and his legislative allies also must overcome opposition from influential business groups and a rift among Republicans.\par \par \uc2 The GOP's split over immigration has prevented legislation from passing -- proposals favored by Kobach and a plan from a business coalition that includes the powerful \uc2 Kansas Chamber of Commerce\uc2  to create a state program to place some illegal immigrants in hard-to-fill jobs. Kobach and legislators don't expect the stalemate to be broken before lawmakers adjourn.\par \par \uc2 Kobach, a Republican and a former law professor known nationally for advising officials in other states on immigration, believes the U.S. Supreme Court will uphold much or all of the Arizona law and spur a wave of legislation next year. But it is this year's legislative elections that will determine whether Kansas joins the trend, he said.\par \par \uc2 "One thing we know, and that is that lots of legislators will walk their districts again," Kobach told The Associated Press during an interview. "I am absolutely 100 percent certain that immigration will be one of the top two or three things."\par \par \uc2 The U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments last week on a legal challenge to the Arizona law from President Barack Obama's administration. The 2010 law requires police officers to check the immigration status of people they suspect are in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 When Obama's solicitor general argued that Arizona improperly infringed upon the federal government's authority to set immigration policy, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Sonia Sotomayor were skeptical. Roberts said the state simply wanted to notify federal authorities of possible illegal immigrants, and Sotomayor commented, "You can see it's not selling very well."\par \par \uc2 A proposal for a similar law in Kansas is stuck in a House committee, along with two other measures. One would make it a crime to knowingly harbor an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , and the other would require state and local government contractors to use the federal E-Verify database to check whether new employees are in the U.S. legally.\par \par \uc2 A narrower E-Verify bill cleared a committee in the House, but Speaker Mike O'Neal, a Hutchinson Republican, refused to schedule a debate. He didn't think he could prevent a debate on tougher measures -- or the business coalition's proposal -- and told fellow Republicans he wanted to avoid a "bloody" dispute that would split his party's huge majority.\par \par \uc2 "If there is going to be something, I want something that gets broad support," O'Neal said last week. "There's much more to this issue than, `What part of illegal don't you understand?' "\par \par \uc2 O'Neal and Kobach said legislators will want to examine the high court's decision on the Arizona law instead of relying on justices' public comments. The Legislature expects to adjourn by mid-May, weeks before the court is expected to rule.\par \par \uc2 Rep. Anthony Brown, a Eudora Republican, said legislators should concentrate on an E-Verify bill.\par \par \uc2 "Some of the other stuff, I don't think, is going to get through the system anyway, in the current makeup of the Legislature," he said.\par \par \uc2 Senate Majority Leader Jay Emler, a Lindsborg Republican, said lawmakers simply don't have enough time left in a session that's crowded with other issues, such as cutting taxes, approving a budget and redrawing political boundaries.\par \par \uc2 The Senate's GOP leaders have been cool to immigration proposals favored by Kobach, but their hold on the chamber will be tested by primary challenges. All 40 Senate seats and 125 House seats are on the ballot this year, but Kobach said immigration legislation is "entirely dependent" on what happens in the Senate races.\par \par \uc2 "Fighting pitched battles in the House is futile when everybody knows that the Senate is going to kill it anyway," Kobach said.\par \par \uc2 Kobach, who traveled to Washington to observe the arguments in front of the U.S. Supreme Court, was confident the court will uphold most, if not all, of the Arizona law. Emler, however, believes Kobach's prediction is "pure conjecture."\par \par \uc2 Eric Stafford\uc2 , a state chamber lobbyist, acknowledged that even if the court rules as Kobach expects, the secretary of state and his allies will still face concerns that their proposals will harm the economy by leaving some industries, including agriculture, with worker shortages.\par \par \uc2 "Regardless of the outcome, we need to encourage the federal government to do something," Stafford said. "Comprehensive immigration reform isn't just enforcement."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Online:\par \par \uc2 Kansas Legislature: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.kslegislature.org"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.kslegislature.org}}}\par \par \uc2 Kansas secretary of state: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.kssos.org"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.kssos.org}}}\par \par \uc2 John Hanna can be reached at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.twitter.com/apjdhanna"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.twitter.com/apjdhanna}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120429e84t001nl\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 McALLEN, Texas (AP) - An unprecedented surge of children caught trudging through South Texas scrublands or crossing at border ports of entry without their families has sent government and nonprofit agencies scrambling to expand their shelter, legal representation and reunification services. On any given day this year, the U.S. Office of Refugee Resettlement has been caring for more than 2,100 unaccompanied child immigrants.\par \par \uc2 The influx came to light last week when 100 kids were taken to Lackland Air Force Base near San Antonio for temporary housing. It was the first time the government has turned to the Defense Department -- now, 200 boys and girls younger than 18 stay in a base dormitory.\par \par \uc2 While the issue of unaccompanied minors arriving in the U.S. isn't new, the scale of the recent increase is. From October 2011 through March, 5,252 kids landed in U.S. custody without a parent or guardian -- a 93 percent increase from the same period the previous year, according to data released by the Department of Health and Human Services. In March alone, 1,390 kids arrived.\par \par \uc2 "The whole community right now is in triage mode," said Wendy Young, executive director of Kids in Need of Defense, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit that matches pro bono attorneys with unaccompanied minors navigating the immigration system. "It's important that the resources and the capacity meet the need, and we're not quite there yet."\par \par \uc2 The Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Refugee Resettlement facilities in 10 states range from shelters to foster homes and have about 2,500 beds. Government-contracted shelters were maxing out their emergency bed space, setting up cots in gymnasiums and other extra spaces.\par \par \uc2 "It's a much more limited set of services," said Lauren Fisher of the South Texas Pro Bono Asylum Representation Project, which helps children and their families navigate the system. "It felt something like a Red Cross shelter, a hurricane shelter."\par \par \uc2 Unaccompanied children are first processed by the Department of Homeland Security, and then turned over to the ORR while the deportation process begins. Once in a shelter, the search begins for their relatives or an acceptable custodian, while nonprofit organizations try to match the children with pro bono attorneys. When a custodian is found, the child can leave the shelter and await immigration proceedings.\par \par \uc2 Eighty percent of the children referred to the ORR end up in a shelter, according to a report released last month by the Vera Institute of Justice -- a nonprofit that developed a program to better provide access to legal services for children. The average shelter stay is 61 days, and the report found that at least 65 percent of the kids end up with a sponsor in the U.S.\par \par \uc2 The cause of the surge remains a mystery to child migrant advocates and government officials. The kids are coming from the same places as usual --Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and Mexico -- and they offer the same range of explanations: they made the trek to look for parents already in the U.S.; they're seeking economic opportunity to send money home; they want to escape violence or abuse.\par \par \uc2 "We're talking to the children, but we don't have one solid answer," Fisher said. "There seem to be the same reasons that we've seen before."\par \par \uc2 Some have suggested that human smugglers are more aggressively marketing their services. Others wonder if the Border Patrol, whose presence has doubled in recent years, is simply catching more of them. But Border Patrol apprehensions of children and adults were cut in half from 2008 to 2011, and only 5 percent of those caught are unaccompanied children. Younger children commonly cross with adult smugglers at the ports of entry, while older kids join groups that follow guides through the brush.\par \par \uc2 A South Texas woman told border authorities this month that the 5-year-old girl accompanying her at the international bridge connecting Hidalgo, Texas, and Reynosa, Mexico, was her sister, according to court records. She even presented a Texas birth certificate. But the girl couldn't answer basic questions, so the woman told customs officers that she wasn't related to the girl at all. She said that a man whom she worked with in Mexico offered her $2,000 to "cross" the girl -- who was actually from Guatemala -- and accompany her to Houston. The woman was charged with transporting an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 This week, the first ladies of Mexico, Honduras and Guatemala spoke at a three-day conference on unaccompanied minors in Washington, D.C. Mexico's first lady, Margarita Zavala, and Honduran counterpart Rosa Elena Bonilla de Lobo noted that tougher U.S. border security made it more difficult for parents working in the U.S. to return for their children, a suggestion as to why parents increasingly would put their children in a smuggler's care.\par \par \uc2 "The statistics are worrisome," said Rosa Maria Leal de Perez, Guatemala's first lady. "We've had 6,000 unaccompanied children repatriated in the last year."\par \par \uc2 The Department of Health and Human Services limited its public statements on the unaccompanied migrant children program, but it allowed a few reporters to take a short tour this week of the housing at Lackland Air Force base. They were not allowed to speak with children.\par \par \uc2 The beige, nondescript four-story dormitory is located deep on the base. When children arrive, they are issued black duffel bags filled with clothing and are allowed two phone calls a week. Three-quarters of the children are boys, most between 14 and 17 years old.\par \par \uc2 Green cots were spaced two feet apart along the stark-white walls. A media room held a large flat-screen television and a video game console; there were also board games and an outside area with a basketball hoop and two soccer goals. The kids play outside for an hour each day.\par \par \uc2 "We are looking to add some educational features that are appropriate for a 30-day temporary program," HHS spokesman Jesse Garcia said, though the goal is to move kids to more established accommodations within 15 days.\par \par \uc2 As of late Friday, 83 kids had already been transferred out of Lackland, most to permanent facilities. Nineteen had been reunited with family.\par \par \uc2 ----\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writer Paul Weber in San Antonio contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120428e84s00109\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) - Ever since taking office last year as the nation's first Hispanic female governor, New Mexico's Susana Martinez found her family tree scrutinized over whether her Mexican-born paternal grandfather was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Documents obtained by The Associated Press, however, show that he was lawfully admitted to the U.S. as a permanent resident in 1918 and became a U.S. citizen in 1942, something not even Martinez knew and a discovery that removes a potential trouble spot for someone mentioned as a possible vice presidential running mate for Mitt Romney.\par \par \uc2 Martinez was surprised at the news, but maintained that his status, citizen or not, didn't affect her political views. "I embrace lawful immigration," she said. "I think it's what makes America wonderful."\par \par \uc2 The first-term governor insists she's not interested in and wouldn't accept a spot on the GOP ticket. But resolving the questions lifts a "hot potato off her plate," said Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics.\par \par \uc2 "It's been a controversy and it's always mentioned when her name comes up in connection with the vice presidency," he said. "Does it help her? Sure, if Romney has any interest in her and if she has any interest in accepting, if offered."\par \par \uc2 The questions arose after the former prosecutor advocated early last year the repeal of a 2003 law that allowed foreign nationals without Social Security numbers, including illegal immigrants, to get driver's licenses.\par \par \uc2 News accounts about a 1930 census initially fueled the idea that Martinez's paternal grandparents had illegally entered the country. The census used an "AL" to designate that her grandparents were "aliens."\par \par \uc2 That designation wasn't an indication of whether they lawfully entered the U.S. It only meant they were not citizens and hadn't filed papers declaring their intent to become one, according to historians and immigration experts.\par \par \uc2 Critics who opposed Martinez's proposal seized on the reports, arguing that her family offered an example of illegal immigrants coming to the U.S. for a better life and that a repeal of the law would deny others the same chance.\par \par \uc2 When the questions arose, she couldn't turn to her parents. Her father has Alzheimer's disease and her mother died in 2006. The grandfather died in 1976.\par \par \uc2 So she initially accepted media accounts and acknowledged that it appeared her grandparents had come to the U.S. without immigration documents. Meanwhile, her proposal died in the Democratic-controlled Legislature.\par \par \uc2 To try to deal with lingering questions, her political organization last fall found documents that indicated her grandfather, Adolfo R. Martinez, had crossed the border several times in the early 1900s.\par \par \uc2 The immigration documents showed her paternal grandparents followed common practices in crossing what was essentially an open border at the time. The documents weren't clear that he had been lawfully admitted for permanent residency.\par \par \uc2 The AP obtained a "certificate of naturalization," dated April 6, 1942, from the National Archives Southwest Region center in Fort Worth, Texas. When shown the document, Martinez said she was unaware that her grandfather had become a citizen.\par \par \uc2 Martinez said the citizenship information appears to resolve the immigration questions about her grandfather, but wasn't relevant to her political future or her continuing efforts to stop driver's licenses for illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 "I don't see its importance because of this," the governor said. "I've always known that my father's father and grandfather and grandmother were from Mexico. I've never denied it. I've always said it."\par \par \uc2 "Let's just say they did come here illegally. I don't see how I am responsible for that," she said. "I am an American citizen. I am a lawyer. I think it's important to always understand that we are a nation of laws."\par \par \uc2 The grandfather's "certificate of arrival" lists March 16, 1918, as the official date he was lawfully admitted to the U.S. for permanent residency. He arrived in El Paso, Texas, by traveling on the "El Paso Electric Railway," according to the document.\par \par \uc2 His "petition for naturalization" contains personal and family information, including the date and place of his marriage and that he had a scar on his right "first finger."\par \par \uc2 In El Paso, he worked as a taxi driver. The governor said he was estranged from his family of five children, who were born in the city. His wife died in 1934 at age 31, and the children were raised by the wife's mother -- Martinez's maternal great-grandmother.\par \par \uc2 Historians say immigration between the U.S. and Mexico was largely free of restrictions in the early 20th century. Mexicans could easily declare at checkpoints whether their stay was temporary or whether they intended to become permanent U.S. residents.\par \par \uc2 The grandfather and his wife paid a "head tax" in July 1918, which was required of immigrants. He obtained a border-crossing card in 1921, making travel easier during World War I, said Marian Smith, a historian at the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.\par \par \uc2 He was 48 when he became a citizen. It's unclear why the grandfather waited for more than two decades before becoming a citizen.\par \par \uc2 Smith said many longtime immigrant residents decided to complete the naturalization process after a 1940 law that required the fingerprinting and registration of non-citizens living in the U.S. Another possibility was his marriage in 1941 to a U.S. citizen.\par \par \uc2 Guadalupe San Miguel Jr., a history professor at the University of Houston and scholar of Mexican-American history, considers it unfair that a Hispanic elected official like Martinez is subject to scrutiny and possible criticism for the immigrant roots of her family.\par \par \uc2 "It is definitely an anti-Mexican immigrant strain of thought that is being applied to her," he said.\par \par \uc2 Sabato said questions about a candidate or elected official's family history are fair game in politics, and doubts that she would suffer much damage even if her family had entered the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 "Maybe it would be more fair if everybody were subjected to the same scrutiny," he said.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Follow Barry Massey on Twitter at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://twitter.com/bmasseyAP"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://twitter.com/bmasseyAP}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120427e84r0023u\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 DENVER (AP) - Colorado Republicans rejected a measure to allow \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students to attend state colleges at discounted tuition rates Wednesday, an outcome that prompted tears from youth in attendance and some lawmakers.\par \par \uc2 "I don't know what to say," teary-eyed Democratic Sen. Angela Giron told a group of youth outside the House committee room where the bill was shot down on a party-line vote. "I feel like we let you all down." Giron sponsored the bill in the Democratic-led Senate, where it passed this month.\par \par \uc2 The bill would've allowed students who graduated from Colorado high schools to qualify for a tuition rate lower than the out-of-state price, but slightly higher than the resident rate because they would not receive a state subsidy. Democrats argued \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students deserve a chance to continue their education at an affordable rate because the state has spent money educating them in the K-12 system. The out-of-state rate is up to five times more expensive than the in-state rate.\par \par \uc2 If the measure passed, it could have impacted an estimated 500 \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students the first year, about 0.20 percent of the enrollment at state public colleges. About 250,000 students are enrolled in state public higher-education institutions.\par \par \uc2 It would have been up to public colleges whether to participate in allowing students to attend at a discounted rate, and students would have been required to submit a signed affidavit stating that they were seeking, or planned to seek, legal status.\par \par \uc2 Thirteen states -- including Texas, California, Illinois, Connecticut and Utah-- have passed legislation granting in-state tuition for immigrant students, according to the \uc2 National Conference of State Legislatures\uc2 . The rates for \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students who went to college in those states varied, with California and Texas having the largest participation. In both states, \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students made up about 1 percent of the total student college enrollment, according to the \uc2 NCSL\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 In Utah, where enrollment is 174,000, about 630 \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students attended college at the in-state tuition rate, according to the latest figures.\par \par \uc2 Republicans argue that a college degree won't fix the student's legal status and they'll have trouble finding jobs. Republican Rep. Brian DelGrosso, who chairs the committee that rejected the bill, said he understands the argument from supporters that the current system leaves \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students hopeless. But the bill would set up families for a financial hardship later, he said.\par \par \uc2 "Once they're done with their education, they can't legally work here," he said. "And so to me, we're not stopping that feeling of hopelessness, we're instead prolonging it. We're putting families in a lot worse financial situation."\par \par \uc2 DelGrosso said the bill highlights the fact that college is expensive for everyone, not just illegal immigrants. He noted that he joined the military to help pay for his education. He said illegal immigrants can go to college now at the out-of-state rate, and that voting against the bill doesn't deny them the chance at a college education.\par \par \uc2 Democratic Rep. Crisanta Duran, who carried the bill in the House, did not buy that argument.\par \par \uc2 "Price does mean access. And they will concede that for Colorado kids, but they will not concede that for undocumented students. It's a double standard," Duran said.\par \par \uc2 Before the vote, she asked lawmakers to not "forget the history on which this country was founded on."\par \par \uc2 "Sometimes we have selective memory," she said.\par \par \uc2 This is the sixth time the Legislature has considered what type of tuition illegal immigrants should pay.\par \par \uc2 Under this year's bill, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  attending the University of Colorado at Boulder, for example, would pay about $9,500 annually, compared with an estimated $7,700 for Colorado residents and about $28,850 for non-Colorado residents.\par \par \uc2 Democratic Denver mayor Michael Hancock and former mayor Guillermo "Bill" Vidal supported the bill, and Vidal has testified in favor three times. Vidal, who was born in Cuba, was Denver's first foreign-born mayor.\par \par \uc2 "All they are guilty of is being innocent children who had no choice but to follow the role of their parents," Vidal said of the students.\par \par \uc2 Isaias Vasquez, 20, cried and hugged a friend after the vote.\par \par \uc2 "We thought we could do it," he said.\par \par \uc2 He said his family moved to Colorado from the Mexican state of Zacatecas when he was 11. He said he graduated last year and attended one semester at the \uc2 Metropolitan State College of Denver\uc2  but stopped going because he couldn't afford it. The out-of-state rate at the college is $15,690 for two full-time semesters.\par \par \uc2 He said he knows the vote doesn't deny him the opportunity to attend college, and that he's saving money to go back.\par \par \uc2 "It's not denying, but it's still an obstacle, which is very, very difficult to get through," he said.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Find Ivan Moreno on Twitter: http:twitter.com/IvanJourno\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120426e84q0002n\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 DENVER (AP) - A proposal to let \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students attend Colorado colleges at a discounted rate will be tested Wednesday by a panel led by Republicans who have expressed concern about the bill.\par \par \uc2 Under the plan, students who graduate from a Colorado high school could qualify for a tuition rate lower than the out-of-state price, but slightly higher than the resident rate. The bill passed a crucial vote out the Education Committee Monday when Republican Rep. Tom Massey joined Democrats to advance the proposal out of the GOP-controlled panel.\par \par \uc2 But the bill faces long odds because the Finance Committee, which now considers it, does not have Republicans who have expressed support.\par \par \uc2 Democrats said the students deserve a chance to continue their education at an affordable rate because the state has spent money educating them in the K-12 system. The out-of-state rate is up to five times more expensive than the in-state rate.\par \par \uc2 About 70 percent of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students in Colorado live at or below the poverty level and likely wouldn't attend college on the out-of-state rate, according to an analysis by nonpartisan legislative staff.\par \par \uc2 Republicans argue that a college degree won't fix the student's legal status and they'll have trouble finding jobs. Opponents also question whether the bill encourages illegal behavior, instead of punishing it.\par \par \uc2 The proposal requires that students who want the discounted rate to sign an affidavit stating that they're seeking, or will seek, legal status.\par \par \uc2 This is the sixth time the Legislature has considered what type of tuition illegal immigrants should pay. Other proposals would've given illegal immigrants the in-state rate, which includes a state subsidy. This year's proposal does not include that subsidy, creating a third tuition category in between the in-state and out-of-state rates. It would be up to colleges whether to participate.\par \par \uc2 Democratic Denver mayor Michael Hancock and former mayor Guillermo "Bill" Vidal spoke in support of the bill Monday. Vidal, who was born in Cuba, was Denver's first foreign-born mayor.\par \par \uc2 An analysis from legislative staff says as many as 500 students could qualify for the third tuition category the first year the bill becomes law.\par \par \uc2 Thirteen states -- including Texas, California, Illinois and Connecticut -- have passed legislation granting in-state tuition for immigrant students, according to the \uc2 National Conference of State Legislatures\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120425e84p000se\par }\par \b \uc2 Search Summary\b0\par \par
