The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 BOSTON (AP) \u8212\'20\'14 Officers at a Dartmouth detention center used excessive force when they deployed pepper spray, police dogs and a flash bang device against inmates who refused to be tested for COVID-19, according to a state report released Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 In a scathing report, the Massachusetts attorney general's office determined that the Bristol County sheriff's office violated the civil rights of federal immigration detainees after some became destructive in a May altercation.\par \par \uc2 The report acknowledged that some inmates had thrown plastic chairs at officers and damaged property, but it says the scene had been calm for an hour when a sheriff's team entered and used force.\par \par \uc2 Attorney General \uc2 Maura Healey\uc2  urged the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2  to terminate its contract with the sheriff's office and threatened to sue the sheriff's office if it fails to implement changes.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThis callous disregard for the well-being of immigration detainees is unacceptable and must be addressed through the significant reforms we outline in our report,\u8221\'20\'1D Healey said in a statement.\par \par \uc2 The sheriff's office said it stands by its response and is awaiting results of a \u8220\'20\'1Ctruly independent investigation" by federal immigration officials. It called Healey's report a \u8220\'20\'1Cpolitically motivated stunt\u8221\'20\'1D meant to demonize law enforcement officers.\par \par \uc2 The report \u8220\'20\'1Cis littered with baseless allegations and assumptions, and was clearly written and released to advance her long-documented anti-ICE, pro-\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  political agenda,\u8221\'20\'1D the sheriff's office said in a statement.\par \par \uc2 A federal immigration official previously applauded the handling of the case, saying the sheriff\u8217\'20\'19s office \u8220\'20\'1Cresponded rapidly and professionally to de-escalate a volatile situation, limiting injuries and further damage to the facility and restoring order.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Healey's investigation focused on a May 1 altercation involving 25 inmates at a wing reserved for detainees being held for \uc2 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2 . After 10 showed symptoms of COVID-19, officers sought to remove them from the wing and isolate them until they tested negative for the virus.\par \par \uc2 Some inmates refused to leave the bunkroom amid concerns they would be exposed to the virus at the center's medical unit, investigators found. Some others spoke little English and did not understand what was happening.\par \par \uc2 The situation erupted when a struggle broke out between the sheriff and an inmate who was using a nearby phone to call his attorney. Some of the inmates and several officers rushed together and an altercation broke out, investigators said.\par \par \uc2 After an officer used pepper spray on the crowd, the officers fled the room and two or three inmates threw chairs at them. Several detainees started damaging the unit, breaking walls, appliances and sinks, and using tables and mattresses to barricade doors.\par \par \uc2 As a team of officers prepared to enter an hour later, the center's superintendent told them that inmates had makeshift weapons and that all 25 were rioting, according to the report. Investigators, however, challenged that account.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CMuch of this information was demonstrably false or otherwise misleading, according to the evidence available,\u8221\'20\'1D the report said. During much of the intervening hour, camera footage showed the inmates walking, sitting or lying down, investigators said.\par \par \uc2 Around 7 p.m., 16 officers opened the door, threw a flash bang device into the unit and ordered all the inmates to the ground. Most detainees followed the order, the report says, but officers went on to fire 30 pepper ball rounds and ordered police dogs to issue \u8220\'20\'1Cmuzzle hits\u8221\'20\'1D on inmates who were already on the ground.\par \par \uc2 So much pepper was used that two inmates were taken to a hospital and a third needed emergency chest compressions, the report said.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CPerhaps most shocking, the detainee who required emergency chest compressions was not taken to the hospital for a medical evaluation or assessment, but was instead placed in solitary confinement,\u8221\'20\'1D according to the report.\par \par \uc2 Healey concluded that the response violated federal detention standards. She urged the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2  to sever ties with the sheriff's office and transfer its immigration detainees to another facility.\par \par \uc2 She told the sheriff's office to update its policies on use of force and to hire an external review of its policies, among more than a dozen recommendations. If changes aren't made, her office wrote, \u8220\'20\'1Cwe reserve our right to pursue litigation.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020201215egcf00v0p\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc1}{\*\bkmkend toc1}\b \uc2 John Hickenlooper wins Colorado's Democratic Senate primary\b0\par\par\uc2 By NICHOLAS RICCARDI \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 859 \uc2 words\par \uc2 30 June 2020\par 23:57\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2020.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 DENVER (AP) \u8212\'20\'14 Former \uc2 Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper\uc2  won the Democratic nomination Tuesday to face Republican \uc2 Sen. Cory Gardner\uc2  in November, overcoming a series of stumbles and beating back a challenge from his left.\par \par \uc2 Hickenlooper's defeat of former Colorado House Speaker Andrew Romanoff was the second win by a centrist Democrat in a Senate primary Tuesday, after a late vote count from last week's Kentucky Senate primary gave \uc2 Amy McGrath\uc2  the win over State Rep. Charles Booker. Romanoff is a former moderate who turned himself into a populist, running against the moderate favorite of the Democratic establishment and promising a Green New Deal and single-payer health care.\par \par \uc2 But he could not overcome both Hickenlooper's immense financial edge \u8212\'20\'14 the former governor out-raised Romanoff by about 7-to-1 \u8212\'20\'14 and his deep name ID and reservoir of goodwill among voters stemming from two terms in the governor's mansion.\par \par \uc2 That's why Senate Democrats recruited Hickenlooper, 68, to take on Gardner, widely seen as the most vulnerable Republican in the Senate. Democrats need to net three seats in November to win control of the chamber if they win the White House, and they see Colorado as their most promising opportunity. Senate Democrats convinced Hickenlooper to run as his ill-fated bid for the Democratic presidential nomination fizzled last summer.\par \par \uc2 Hickenlooper's relatively easy win against Romanoff, Democrats argue, showed his resilience as a candidate whom Coloradans trust as a gaffe-prone, but authentic, leader.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI've never lost an election in this state and I don\u8217\'20\'19t intend to lose this one,\u8221\'20\'1D Hickenlooper said Tuesday night as he previewed his line of attack against Gardner: \u8220\'20\'1CWe know what Donald Trump told us himself: \uc2 Cory Gardner\uc2  is with him 100% of the time.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 In an interview, Gardner previewed how he intends to fight back. In contrast to Hickenlooper's attempt to link the election to national issues like Trump, the coronavirus pandemic and collapsing economy, Gardner rattled off some of his recent accomplishments \u8212\'20\'14 luring the headquarters of U.S. Space Command and the \uc2 Bureau of Land Management\uc2  to Colorado and passing a sweeping public lands bill.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI'm with the people of Colorado 100% of the time,\u8221\'20\'1D Gardner, 45, said.\par \par \uc2 The Republican Senator also called Hickenlooper \u8220\'20\'1Cthe most corrupt governor in the history of Colorado.\u8221\'20\'1D It was a reference to the state ethics commission finding in early June that Hickenlooper violated the state's ethics law by failing to reimburse for a private plane flight and limousine ride while he was governor. Hickenlooper had refused to testify during a virtual hearing, insisting on an in-person one, earning a contempt citation from the nonpartisan commission.\par \par \uc2 The ethics case was part of a miserable final stretch for Hickenlooper in June. Amid the protests over police violence against Black people, Hickenlooper garbled the meaning of the slogan \u8220\'20\'1CBlack Lives Matter.\u8221\'20\'1D The following week, an African American Romanoff supporter tweeted a 6-year-old video of Hickenlooper jokingly comparing politicians to slaves being whipped to row \u8220\'20\'1Can ancient slave ship.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The combination of the gaffes and setbacks was enough to lure Republicans to launch millions of dollars in ads attacking Hickenlooper. Democrats responded with defensive ads, and Romanoff then jumped in and added his own attack ad versus the former governor.\par \par \uc2 Colorado's Democratic establishment, from \uc2 Gov. Jared Polis\uc2  to Sen. Michael Bennet, condemned Romanoff for the move. Then, days later, a big-money group that will not disclose its donors launched a $1 million ad campaign slamming Romanoff for spearheading an anti-\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  bill in 2006. Romanoff has since apologized for the bill.\par \par \uc2 Republicans always expected Hickenlooper to win the primary, though many rooted for Romanoff and the GOP hopes that Hickenlooper has been banged up enough to give Gardner a chance in the November election.\par \par \uc2 But Colorado Democrats are eager to oust Gardner. Romanoff quickly called Hickenlooper to congratulate him on the victory after polls closed Tuesday evening. \u8220\'20\'1CFor all the differences that we had, and there were many in this race, I am equally committed to making sure \uc2 Cory Gardner\uc2  is a one-term senator,\u8221\'20\'1D Romanoff told supporters during a virtual victory party on Zoom.\par \par \uc2 No Republican has won a statewide election in Colorado since 2014, when Gardner won by less than 2 percentage points in a strong year for Republicans. Hickenlooper was reelected as governor that year by a wider margin.\par \par \uc2 FILE - In this Aug. 10, 2019 file photo, then Democratic presidential candidate former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper speaks at the Presidential Gun Sense Forum in Des Moines, Iowa. Now a candidate for the U.S. Senate, Hickenlooper defended his record Friday, June 5, 2020 at a state ethics hearing about travel on private jets he took as Colorado governor, one day after the ethics panel found him in contempt for failing to appear. Hickenlooper rejected claims he violated Colorado law by accepting trips and insisted they either involved personal business or happened while he was touting Colorado's economy to potential investors during his 2011-2019 term.

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc2}{\*\bkmkend toc2}\b \uc2 Sanders-linked group entered into racial discrimination NDA\b0\par\par\uc2 By BRIAN SLODYSKO and WILL WEISSERT \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 1,412 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 February 2020\par 17:17\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2020.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) \u8212\'20\'14 A political advocacy group founded by Bernie Sanders entered into a nondisclosure agreement with an African American political consultant that bars her from discussing a lawsuit alleging racial discrimination at the organization and the Vermont senator's 2016 presidential campaign.\par \par \uc2 The consultant, Tezlyn Figaro, confirmed the existence of the nondisclosure agreement to The Associated Press without providing additional details.\par \par \uc2 The deal is tied to a 2019 lawsuit in which Figaro said she was fired from the Sanders-created political group Our Revolution a year earlier due to her race and in \u8220\'20\'1Cretaliation for complaining about the organization\u8217\'20\'19s treatment towards her and African-Americans.\u8221\'20\'1D The lawsuit was settled out of court for an undisclosed amount of money. Though the lawsuit was aimed at Our Revolution, it included broad criticism of Sanders' campaign, arguing an all-white leadership staff \u8220\'20\'1Cwas accused of racism\u8221\'20\'1D by black staffers and failed to engage black voters.\par \par \uc2 Nondisclosure agreements, or NDAs, have become common in presidential campaigns and political organizations in recent years as tools to guard against the release of private data, strategic conversations or other proprietary information. But such deals have become increasingly controversial as people alleging that they're victims of sexual harassment and misconduct or, in Figaro's case, racial discrimination have said they're prevented from publicly sharing their stories.\par \par \uc2 Billionaire Mike Bloomberg, one of Sanders' Democratic presidential race rivals, has faced criticism for the use of nondisclosure agreements at his company in cases related to sexual harassment. The former New York mayor has said he's willing to release three women from nondisclosure agreements related to comments he was accused of making in the past.\par \par \uc2 Sanders has acknowledged the mistreatment of women and minorities who worked on his 2016 campaign, and his advisers say they've taken corrective measures for his second run. Now the front-runner for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, Sanders frequently says he is building a \u8220\'20\'1Cmultiracial, multi-generational movement\u8221\'20\'1D that will appeal to the broad coalition needed to win the primary and defeat President \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 But legal experts say that argument could be undermined by a nondisclosure agreement that prevents a woman of color who has criticized Sanders' record on race from talking about her experience.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CAnyone running for the presidency should be accountable to the electorate, and we should have access to the full set of information,\u8221\'20\'1D said Debra S. Katz, a prominent employment attorney in Washington who has donated to Elizabeth Warren's campaign. "If the allegations are about his campaign and running a racist operation, he should direct this organization to let her out of those non-disparagement obligations and talk about it.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Figaro was the director of racial justice for Sanders' 2016 campaign, then worked on black outreach issues for Our Revolution. According to federal court records, her case against Our Revolution was settled in July 2019 for an undisclosed amount.\par \par \uc2 Figaro confirmed the existence of the NDA but declined to comment further. Her attorney, Anthony J. Hall, said he could not comment on the terms of the settlement.\par \par \uc2 A spokesman for Our Revolution did not respond to multiple requests for comment. The Sanders campaign said it couldn't comment on the specifics of the case, arguing the campaign can't legally have insight into the activities of Our Revolution.\par \par \uc2 In a statement, Sanders campaign spokeswoman Sarah Ford said, \u8220\'20\'1CWe oppose using NDAs to silence the victims of toxic workplace issues."\par \par \uc2 After his effort to win the 2016 Democratic nomination failed, Sanders founded Our Revolution to keep up the momentum from the campaign. The group has employed current and former Sanders presidential staffers but operates independently from his campaign, though it has raised millions of dollars to support his current bid.\par \par \uc2 Figaro's roughly yearlong tenure at Our Revolution was tumultuous.\par \par \uc2 She was brought on by former Our Revolution President Nina Turner, a top Sanders surrogate who is now national co-chair of his 2020 campaign. When Turner tried to make Figaro Our Revolution's chief of staff, board members objected.\par \par \uc2 Past comments Figaro made about immigration on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and as a pundit on Fox News quickly surfaced and drew rebuke, with critics and some Our Revolution staffers saying that they were anti-immigrant.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIf AMERICAN black folks can go to jail when they break the law then certainly so can an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 ,\u8221\'20\'1D she said in one tweet.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CU r being distracted abt ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS meanwhile more blacks are under prison/parole control in in 2010 than were enslaved in 1850," she wrote in another.\par \par \uc2 Figaro, who had long worked as a consultant to Turner, publicly apologized but was fired. Our Revolution was aware of her past comments when she was hired, according to her lawsuit. Turner didn't respond to a request for comment.\par \par \uc2 In the past, Figaro defended herself by noting that her comments echoed what Sanders has previously said.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIf poverty is increasing and if wages are going down, I don\u8217\'20\'19t know why we need millions of people to be coming into this country as guest workers who will work for lower wages than American workers and drive wages down even lower than they are now,\u8221\'20\'1D Sanders said in a 2007 television interview explaining why he opposed a bipartisan immigration bill.\par \par \uc2 Sanders\u8217\'20\'19 campaign says its key to victory in the 2020 Democratic primary and general election is to dramatically grow the electorate, appealing to working-class Americans and minorities who have often felt disillusioned with the political system.\par \par \uc2 Sanders' campaign manager, \uc2 Faiz Shakir\uc2 , is the first Muslim American to lead a presidential campaign. Sanders likens his movement to the civil rights struggle, and he often mentions his own activist past, including getting arrested during protests decrying racism while at the \uc2 University of Chicago\uc2  in the 1960s. He has worked hard to woo minority groups, which has energized many young voters.\par \par \uc2 But in 2016, black staffers who were hired by Sanders to conduct African American outreach say the campaign did not take them seriously. Minority staffers said they were sent to do other tasks, like driving people around, instead of courting the black voters Sanders said he wanted to win.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CPeople will say it\u8217\'20\'19s not a racial issue,\u8221\'20\'1D said John Solomon, who was based in Atlanta for the 2016 campaign and said he was sometimes assigned responsibilities that were outside of his job description. \u8220\'20\'1CBut if I'm hired to gain support from African Americans and you go direct me to do something other than reach out to the African American community, what are we doing?\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 After the black outreach team booked several successful events, including a rally at historically black Morehouse College in Atlanta, resources dwindled and black outreach staffers say Sanders' campaign began brushing them off.\par \par \uc2 His campaign has acknowledged Sanders' past failings and said it is trying to right them now.\par \par \uc2 Sanders has invested heavily in Spanish-language television advertising and organized dozens of events meant to appeal to Hispanic voters, including soccer tournaments for volunteers in Iowa and Texas and a town hall in Spanish led by New York Rep.

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc4}{\*\bkmkend toc4}\b \uc2 Scholarship helps first-generation law students buy books\b0\par\par\uc2 By BARRY CARTER \par \uc2 NJ.com\par \uc2 1,080 \uc2 words\par \uc2 20 September 2019\par 15:29\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2019.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 NEWARK, N.J. (AP) \u8212\'20\'14 Yelky Perez set up her book scholarship for first generation lawyers.\par \par \uc2 It's a noble project, considering Perez, 27, is just like them. Not only is the Teaneck resident the first in her family to attend law school, Perez is only one year ahead of the incoming Rutger Law School students she's helping to pay for books.\par \par \uc2 Okay. Scratching your head, right? Hang on. Perez remembers the sticker shock last August, her first year, when she was accepted into Rutgers' Minority Student Program (MSP), an initiative created in 1968 to improve the law school's racial makeup.\par \par \uc2 Everything came to about $400, but Perez was able to manage, paying for books the first semester with a job she had along with help from her parents who kicked in for two books.\par \par \uc2 After she was hired as an intern in February with Lowenstein Sandler, a Roseland law firm, Perez figured she'd put aside $400 each from her first two weekly paychecks to help two students. She understood that it can be a hardship for minority students like her to foot the bill while adjusting to the rigors of legal training.\par \par \uc2 "This was my opportunity to do something," Perez said.\par \par \uc2 She shared the idea with lawyers at the firm, and it caught on rapidly. Soon the attorneys there got behind the idea, and Perez had raised $9,450 to purchase 27 gift cards, each worth $350.\par \par \uc2 "The firm is supportive of these kinds of things," said Craig Dashiell, a Lowenstein attorney, who is also a Rutgers alum and MSP member. "It's great when it comes organically from the bottom up instead of the top down. This was a junior attorney who wasn't afraid to bring this idea to other people."\par \par \uc2 For the incoming MSP students, the gift was out of the blue and right on time.\par \par \uc2 Shelby Mitchell, 22, of Washington, D.C. didn't have much money left after relocating to New Jersey and finding an apartment. Already low on funds, it didn't help that her work study job had not started yet.\par \par \uc2 "If I didn't have this book scholarship, I would have had to scramble some way to get my books," Mitchell said. "I can't even think of what I would do."\par \par \uc2 Giving out the card this month reminded Perez of how someone helped her after she came to this country as an undocumented immigrant. She was 13, didn't speak English, but learned fast and studied hard. By 15, Perez was the 2008 valedictorian at Adlai E. Stevenson High School in the Bronx, but she didn't have any scholarship offers for college.\par \par \uc2 She wasn't an American citizen, making her ineligible to receive any kind of financial assistance.\par \par \uc2 Catherine Chugranis, a former teacher at Stevenson, stepped in with the same generosity Perez has shown to help Rutger's law students.\par \par \uc2 Perez raised money for books. Chugranis paid for her college education.\par \par \uc2 "I told her she inspired me to do this," Perez said.\par \par \uc2 Perez was never her student, but Chugranis, said she was brilliant in all of her subjects and wanted to help, knowing that she would not be able to afford college.\par \par \uc2 "She's now giving it back," Chugranis said. "She's going to keep passing it on and a lot of people are going to get help. That's the name of the game. Help as many people as you can."\par \par \uc2 A graduate of \uc2 Baruch College\uc2  in New York, Perez finished at the top of her class in the school of journalism and public affairs, a major in which she became an immigration activist.\par \par \uc2 "It put me on the right path," Perez said. "I was doing protesting because I couldn't be what I wanted to be."\par \par \uc2 Doctor, accountant, lawyer \u8212\'20\'14 she had had aspired to each of those professions at one time or another, but all require a license.\par \par \uc2 Perez is no longer an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , but the issue remains close to her heart. After she married seven years ago, Perez was eligible for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) to obtain a green card and a path toward citizenship. Because of DACA, she was able to apply for law school. She's eligible to be a citizen, but doesn't forget about immigrants who want to be here legally.\par \par \uc2 "If I can help this person avoid deportation, I will," she said.\par \par \uc2 Her focus for now is the law students, whom she selected after reading essays on why they should be considered. The decision wasn't easy. Thirty-seven students applied and Perez said their stories made her cry.\par \par \uc2 One student wrote that women are only allowed to pursue education up to eighth grade in her country; another said he and his brother were the first men in their family not to have gone to jail. There was a refugee from Bosnia and a young man who had been supporting himself since his parents died.\par \par \uc2 The gift cards were not just a lift financially. Receiving them well before class starts is invaluable to students academically. They can get started on reading assignments to be prepared for class.\par \par \uc2 Otherwise, Perez said they would be behind, because many of them can't purchase the books until they receive financial aid, assistance that generally arrives two weeks after class.\par \par \uc2 "There's no way to catch up," Perez said.\par \par \uc2 Argjenta Kaba, 22, of Wayne said the book scholarship helped to jumpstart her legal education and she praised Perez for having the wherewithal to be so thoughtful.\par \par \uc2 "It was so happy for me to see a person who is only a year above me doing so many good things," Kaba said.\par \par \uc2 It's not just the book scholarship. Perez has taken another page from Chugranis, a Rockland County, N.Y. resident, who has stayed in touch with her since high school.\par \par \uc2 Perez does the same thing with the students, checking in on them when she sees them on campus.\par \par \uc2 "She's very willing to lend a hand," said Kedar Venkataramani, 24, of South \uc2 Brunswick\uc2 . "I've seen her several times already. This is beyond the gift cards."\par \par \uc2 Perez hopes to do the gift cards next year. It may not be 27, but Perez is going to help as many first generation lawyers as she can.\par \par \uc2 Online: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://bit.ly/2lvbmjZ"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://bit.ly/2lvbmjZ}}}\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 Information from: NJ.com, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.nj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.nj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020190920ef9k014ny\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 NEW DELHI (AP) \u8212\'20\'14 On the day before his five children were to appear in front of a tribunal in India's northeastern state of Assam to prove they were not in the country illegally, Rahim Ali hanged himself outside their corrugated metal shanty in the Muslim village of Banti Pur, his wife said.\par \par \uc2 He was worried the children would be excluded from a government citizenship list that advocates hope will stem decades of unchecked immigration, said Halimun Nessa, standing over Ali's fresh grave. He had feared they would be sent to a detention camp.\par \par \uc2 "He was saying we don't have any money to fight this case. He was thinking that his children will be taken away. He went to the market, came back and did this," said Nessa, adding that she doesn't know what she'll do if her children's names don't appear on the list that will be published on Saturday.\par \par \uc2 Critics of the government's plan to publish a National Register of Citizens, or \uc2 NRC\uc2 , fear it will leave off millions of people, rendering them stateless. And the Hindu nationalist-led government of Prime Minister \uc2 Narendra Modi\uc2 , which fully backs the citizenship project in Assam, vows to roll out a similar plan nationwide.\par \par \uc2 Those suspected of being in the country illegally must prove their citizenship under what is seen as a messy, overly bureaucratic system.\par \par \uc2 Critics view it as a naked attempt to deport millions of minority Muslims, many of whom have entered India from neighboring Bangladesh. But those who have been leading the fight for such a list say the project is meant to protect the cultural identity of Assam's indigenous people, no matter what their faith is.\par \par \uc2 A draft version of the registry that was released in June left off 4.1 million of the more than 32 million residents of Assam state. Some people fled, while others took their own lives, like Ali did in Barpeta, about 130 kilometers (80 miles) northwest of the capital of Gauhati.\par \par \uc2 Those excluded are presumed to be foreigners unless they can prove otherwise at one of hundreds of tribunals presided over by people who are not judges. They have 120 days to file appeals with the tribunals and can take their case to higher courts. If no appeal is filed, a district magistrate makes a referral to the tribunal to strip them of their citizenship.\par \par \uc2 It's unclear what will happen to those ultimately branded as foreigners, because India has no treaty with Bangladesh to deport them. Earlier this summer, India's Supreme Court criticized the central government and that of Assam state, saying thousands of people who had been declared foreigners over the years had disappeared. About 1,000 others are being held in Assam's overcrowded prisons.\par \par \uc2 For hundreds of years, the verdant, hilly state of Assam has drawn workers from neighboring Bangladesh to its massive colonial-era tea plantations.\par \par \uc2 But resentment of these immigrants runs deep. Advocates of a citizenship registry say that because of the influx, foreigners in Assam have gained more political clout than natives.\par \par \uc2 While advocates insist there is no religious dimension, Assamese historians revel in the ancient kingdom's repulsion of the Muslim Mughal "invaders."\par \par \uc2 The director of the first India census in 1931, British raj civil servant J.H. Hutton, warned that as "prodigious breeders," immigrants threatened "to swarm entirely the indigenous population."\par \par \uc2 In 1983, a mob in Assam massacred more than 2,000 Bengali Muslims. No one was ever prosecuted.\par \par \uc2 Modi's home minister, Amit Shah, has called Bangladeshi migrants "infiltrators" and "termites."\par \par \uc2 Millions of people whose citizenship status is now unclear were born in India to parents also born in India. The year 1948 was decreed to be the official cutoff date for refugees from Pakistan, including East Pakistan \u8212\'20\'14 now Bangladesh. The date was later updated to 1951, and again to 1971, the year Bangladesh became an independent country.\par \par \uc2 Hundreds of people with voting rights of diverse lineage, including Hindus and Assamese, have been arrested and detained on suspicion of being a foreign migrant.\par \par \uc2 "I am very shocked that I served 30 years to the nation, now I am a beggar for citizenship," said army veteran Mohammad Sanaullah, who lives in Gauhati.\par \par \uc2 Shah, the home minister, has vowed to expand Assam's registry nationwide, using mandatory identification cards. At the same time, Modi and Shah are expected to resurrect a controversial citizenship bill or take up an obscure constitutional provision to grant citizenship to persecuted believers who entered India illegally from neighboring countries, including Hindus, Sikhs and Christians, but not Muslims.\par \par \uc2 The registry comes less than a month after the Modi government unilaterally stripped Jammu and Kashmir, India's only Muslim-majority state, of special constitutional protections that gave it political autonomy and exclusive land rights.\par \par \uc2 Kashmiris fear that the Himalayan territory, which is also claimed by Pakistan, will lose its culture and demographics in a Hindu land-grab. Much of India applauded the move, with social media filling up with promises to "reclaim" Kashmir.\par \par \uc2 A team of United Nations experts, including the special rapporteur for freedom of religion or belief, said in July that the \uc2 NRC\uc2  could "exacerbate the xenophobic climate while fueling religious intolerance and discrimination in the country."\par \par \uc2 Supporters of the registry, however, say the comparison of Kashmir and Assam is superficial and wrong.\par \par \uc2 Samujjal Bhattacharya, who has been part of a movement in Gauhati against illegal immigration for decades, said the idea that Muslims are being targeted is propaganda pushed by a pro-Bangladeshi conspiracy.\par \par \uc2 "They are propagating that human rights is violated here. We'd like to ask them, 'who is violating human rights?' In our own motherland, our rights are being violated by the illegal Bangladeshis."\par \par \uc2 In 2010, the government selected Barpeta, one of Assam's nine Muslim-majority districts, for a pilot NRC program as part of a plan to verify voter rolls.\par \par \uc2 When protests erupted about the program in the bucolic village of Khandakar Para, police gunfire killed four demonstrators, including 25-year-old Maidul Mullah. He is buried behind a mosque that dates to 1916, and his gravestone honors him for "sacrificing his life on streets of Barpeta for the cause of \uc2 NRC\uc2 ."\par \par \uc2 Another slain protester was Majam Ali, 55. His widow, Noor Begum, is illiterate, but a neighbor helped her submit documents dating back more than a half-century, including her grandfather's listing on the original 1951 \uc2 NRC\uc2  and tax details, to no avail.\par \par \uc2 "My husband shed his blood for the \uc2 NRC\uc2 ," she said, "Everyone who should be on the list should be on it. Then only will (his) death be worth it."\par \par \uc2 Manjuri Bhowmik, a 51-year-old Hindu, dreads what it will mean for her two sons if she is declared a foreigner. Originally from the state of West Bengal, Bhowmik said she had lived in Assam since moving there to marry her husband in 1991. She recently received notice that she was a suspected "D-voter," or "doubtful voter," placing her status and that of her children at risk.\par \par \uc2 Despite submitting copies of ID cards, her degree from \uc2 Calcutta University\uc2  and a deposition from her brother, she sat outside a foreigner tribunal in Barpeta waiting for her chance to prove her citizenship.\par \par \uc2 "People are being harassed," she said. "This causes great mental stress."\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 Associated Press journalists Rishi Lekhi and Anupam Nath in Assam contributed.\par \par \uc2 In this Aug. 28, 2019, photo, Halimun Nessa, 32, stands with her children and displays a photograph of her husband Rahim Ali, who committed suicide the day before his children were to appear in front of a National Register of Citizens tribunal, in Barpeta, in India's northeastern state of Assam.

Barr et al', challenging the government's practice of denying due process to detained immigrants * In June, the ACLU of Massachusetts and the ACLU of New Hampshire filed the lawsuit on behalf of immigrants who were jailed due to flawed detention hearings in which the detainee was required to bear the burden of proof. Under the Constitution, the government cannot take away any person's liberty without showing that is necessary to do so. In immigration proceedings, the \uc2 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2  (ICE) detains immigrants for long periods of time, without being required to make such a showing. Instead, immigrants are detained until they can prove they should not be by demonstrating they are not a danger or flight risk * Before Chief Judge Patti Saris * Case no. 1:19-cv-11314\par \par \uc2 Location: U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, 1 Courthouse Way, Boston, MA\par \par \uc2 Contacts: Chambers of Chief Judge Patti Saris, 1 617 748 9175\par \par \uc2 --------------------\par \par \uc2 Monday, Aug. 05 10:30 AM Westfield State University annual Owl Club Golf Tournament -

Barr et al', challenging the government's practice of denying due process to detained immigrants * In June, the ACLU of Massachusetts and the ACLU of New Hampshire filed the lawsuit on behalf of immigrants who were jailed due to flawed detention hearings in which the detainee was required to bear the burden of proof. Under the Constitution, the government cannot take away any person's liberty without showing that is necessary to do so. In immigration proceedings, the \uc2 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2  (ICE) detains immigrants for long periods of time, without being required to make such a showing. Instead, immigrants are detained until they can prove they should not be by demonstrating they are not a danger or flight risk * Before Chief Judge Patti Saris * Case no. 1:19-cv-11314\par \par \uc2 Location: U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, 1 Courthouse Way, Boston, MA\par \par \uc2 Contacts: Chambers of Chief Judge Patti Saris, 1 617 748 9175\par \par \uc2 --------------------\par \par \uc2 Monday, Aug. 05 10:30 AM Westfield State University annual Owl Club Golf Tournament - Westfield State University 13th annual Owl Club Golf Tournament, with proceeds benefiting the University's varsity athletics teams\par \par \uc2 Location: The Ranch Golf Club, 65 Sunnyside Rd, Southwick, MA\par \par \uc2 Weblinks: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.westfield.ma.edu/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.westfield.ma.edu/}}}\uc2 , {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://twitter.com/westfieldstate"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://twitter.com/westfieldstate}}}\par \par \uc2 Contacts: Troy Watkins, \uc2 Westfield State University\uc2 , twatkins@westfield.ma.edu, 1 413 572 5523\par \par \uc2 --------------------\par \par \uc2 Monday, Aug. 05 2:15 PM Court hearing for judge accused of helping \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  escape courthouse - Interim status conference for Newton, MA, District Court Judge Shelley Richmond Joseph, on pending counts including conspiracy to obstruct justice and aiding and abetting, for her alleged role in helping an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  escape from her courthouse, through a basement door, to avoid \uc2 Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2  officials last year * Case no. 1:19-cr-10141 * Before Judge Donald Cabell * The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court suspended Joseph without pay\par \par \uc2 Location: John Joseph Moakley United States Courthouse, 1 Courthouse Way, Boston, MA\par \par \uc2 Contacts: Chambers of Judge Donald Cabell, 1 617 748 9233\par \par \uc2 --------------------\par \par \uc2 Monday, Aug. 05 - Saturday, Aug. 10 Martha's Vineyard African American Film Festival - Martha's Vineyard African American Film Festival (MVAAFF), presented by Run&Shoot Filmworks, highlighting the artistry of African-American filmmakers from all over the world * Celebs expected\par \par \uc2 Location: Martha's Vineyard Performing Arts Center, 100 Edgartown Road, Vineyard Haven, MA\par \par \uc2 Weblinks: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.mvaaff.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.mvaaff.com}}}\uc2 , {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://twitter.com/mvfilmfestival"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://twitter.com/mvfilmfestival}}}\uc2 , #MVAAFF\par \par \uc2 Contacts: Michelle Pascal , Map Unlimited PR, michelle@mapunlimitedpr.com , 1 917 715 3659\par \par \uc2 --------------------\par \par \uc2 Monday, Aug. 05 - Friday, Aug. 09 Immuno-Oncology Summit\par \par \uc2 Location: The Westin Boston Waterfront, 425 Summer St, Boston, MA\par \par \uc2 Weblinks: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.healthtech.com/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.healthtech.com/}}}\uc2 , {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://twitter.com/CHI_Healthtech"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://twitter.com/CHI_Healthtech}}}\par \par \uc2 Contacts: CHI, chi@healthtech.com, 1 781 972 5400\par \par \uc2 --------------------\par \par \uc2 CORPORATE DATA\par \par \uc2 --------------------\par \par \uc2 Monday, Aug. 05 \uc2 Cabot Corp\uc2 : Q3 2019 Results\par \par \uc2 Weblinks: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://investor.cabot-corp.com/events-and-presentations"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://investor.cabot-corp.com/events-and-presentations}}}\par \par \uc2 Contacts: \uc2 Erica McLaughlin\uc2 , Cabot Corp Investor Relations, erica.mclaughlin@cabotcorp.com, 1 617 342 6090\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020190803ef8300al1\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) \u8212\'20\'14 Missouri House Republicans on Thursday backed away from a budget compromise that would allow colleges and universities to charge in-state tuition to students living in the U.S. illegally.\par \par \uc2 The GOP-led House voted 110-43 against the deal. That means a panel of House and Senate lawmakers will get another shot to negotiate on the policy, which is included in the proposed state budget for public higher education.\par \par \uc2 Lawmakers face a Friday deadline to pass a budget for the upcoming fiscal year, which begins in July.\par \par \uc2 Missouri lawmakers previously put restrictions on the use of state dollars for tuition for students "with an unlawful immigration status." Because of that, schools face losing state funding if they offer those students anything less than the tuition rate charged to international students.\par \par \uc2 Members of a 10-person panel of bipartisan negotiators this week agreed to end that policy. But the move spurred outrage among House Republicans, who voted it down on the House floor.\par \par \uc2 "We only have so much money to allocate to state subsidies for higher education," Springfield Republican Rep. Curtis Trent said. "Why should that not go to the people who live here, who pay taxes here, who have followed the rules and obeyed the laws of the land?"\par \par \uc2 St. Peters Republican Rep. Phil Christofanelli said House lawmakers would be willing to vote down the entire public higher education budget to protest the tuition provision.\par \par \uc2 "I will never vote to fund an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  education in our state's budget," Christofanelli said.\par \par \uc2 Missouri is one of six states that blocks in-state tuition for students living in the country illegally, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Actions by lawmakers in 16 states allow in-state tuition, and five more states provide for that through state university systems.\par \par \uc2 The latest version of Missouri's higher education budget still includes a ban on colleges providing scholarships to students living in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 Democrats slammed efforts to undo the compromise.\par \par \uc2 Columbia Democratic Rep. Kip Kendrick told colleagues during debate on the House floor that he once had to inform a single parent working two part-time jobs that she would have to pay international tuition and she "started bawling, because she understood that higher education, a way out of poverty, was unattainable."\par \par \uc2 "It broke my heart, because this is a person that's done everything we ask of anyone: pulling themselves up by the bootstraps, working hard (and) really trying to become the best person that she can be," he said. "She was brought to this country when she was 1 year old by her parents. That was not a decision of her own."\par \par \uc2 Lawmakers' roughly $30 billion budget proposal includes an additional $61 million in core K-12 public school funding, and colleges and universities are set to get at least $1 million more compared to this year.\par \par \uc2 Lawmakers ditched \uc2 Gov. Mike Parson\uc2 's original plan to borrow $350 million to fix 250 bridges across the state. Instead, they agreed to spend $50 million in un-earmarked general revenue on bridge repairs next fiscal year, plus another $50 million for a local cost-share program.\par \par \uc2 If the state gets a federal infrastructure grant to help pay to fix an Interstate 70 bridge in the mid-Missouri city of Rocheport, that would kick in another roughly $300 million in bonding under another pending proposal.\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020190509ef5900xsp\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The officers instead arrested him based on indications he was in the country illegally and brought him to a detention center for deportation.\par \par \uc2 U.S. District Judge Richard Jones ruled Wednesday that the local police did not have the authority to arrest him for a civil, federal violation. He said a trial will be held to determine what damages the officers must pay.\par \par \uc2 The judge said he would not hold the city liable because there was not enough evidence the officers were acting with the city's blessing.\par \par \uc2 Rodriguez, who has three U.S.-born children, is out of custody while he appeals his deportation order.\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020190509ef5901gmq\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) \u8212\'20\'14 The Democratic-controlled House on Wednesday approved a measure requiring federal background checks for all firearms sales and transfers, the first major gun control legislation considered by Congress in nearly 25 years.\par \par \uc2 Democrats called the 240-190 vote a major step to end the gun lobby's grip on Washington and begin to address an epidemic of gun violence that kills thousands of Americans every year, including 17 people shot and killed at a Florida high school last year.\par \par \uc2 The bill is the first of two the House is voting on this week as Democrats move to tighten gun laws following eight years of Republican control. The other bill would extend the review period for background checks from three to 10 days.\par \par \uc2 Both bills face dim prospects in the Republican-controlled Senate and veto threats from President \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 , who said they would impose unreasonable requirements on gun owners.\par \par \uc2 Just eight Republicans joined 232 Democrats to support the bill, while only two Democrats voted against it.\par \par \uc2 The White House said in a veto message that the background-checks bill could block someone from borrowing a firearm for self-defense or allowing a neighbor to take care of a gun while traveling.\par \par \uc2 Democrats called those arguments misleading and said gun owners have a responsibility to ensure firearms are properly handled. The bill includes exceptions allowing temporary transfers to prevent imminent harm or for use at a target range.\par \par \uc2 The long-delayed bill would merely close loopholes to ensure that background checks are extended to private and online sales that often go undetected, Democrats said.\par \par \uc2 "People who are felons or are dangerously mentally ill shouldn't have guns," regardless of whether they buy them from a federally licensed dealer or their next-door neighbor, said \uc2 Rep. Mike Thompson\uc2 , D-Calif., a key sponsor who has pushed for expanded background checks since the 2012 killing of 20 elementary school students in Newtown, Connecticut.\par \par \uc2 "For six-and-a-half years, we had no cooperation from the past majority" in the House, Thompson said. "We couldn't get a hearing on the bill. We couldn't get a vote. Today, we're here to tell you it's a new day. With this (Democratic) majority, we have made a commitment to address the issue of gun violence."\par \par \uc2 While Republicans mostly opposed the bill, the GOP scored a procedural victory when the House accepted a Republican amendment requiring that gun sellers notify \uc2 Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2  when an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  tries to buy a gun. Twenty-six Democrats joined with Republicans to support the amendment, offered by \uc2 Rep. Doug Collins\uc2 , R-Ga.\par \par \uc2 House Speaker \uc2 Nancy Pelosi\uc2  downplayed the GOP proposal, saying, "We won a big victory \u8212\'20\'14 get the message."\par \par \uc2 Pelosi, D-Calif., called the House vote "historic" and hailed the bill as "a long-overdue, commonsense action to end the epidemic of gun violence in America."\par \par \uc2 To demonstrate her support for the bill, Pelosi wore an orange dress while other Democrats wore orange ties or scarves, the color used by the movement against gun violence.\par \par \uc2 Rep. Madeleine Dean, D-Pa., said she hopes the symbolism will soon become obsolete.\par \par \uc2 "I long for the day when orange scarves are a fashion statement, not a cry for help," said Dean, who was wearing a bright orange scarf.\par \par \uc2 House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., who was gravely wounded in a 2017 shooting at a congressional baseball practice, said stricter background checks would not have prevented his shooting or other tragedies.\par \par \uc2 "What it would do is make criminals out of law-abiding citizens," Scalise said. "If you go hunting with a friend and your friend wants to borrow your rifle, you better bring your attorney with you because depending on what you do with that gun you may be a felon if you loan it to him."\par \par \uc2 Democrats said the bill includes exceptions allowing temporary transfers for anyone who feels threatened by a domestic partner or other person. The bill also allows a gun owner to loan their weapon and for use at a target range.\par \par \uc2 "There is no reason to continue to make it easy for people who are legally prohibited from possessing firearms to acquire them by circumventing the background check process," said \uc2 Rep. Jerrold Nadler\uc2 , D-N.Y., chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. The background checks bill would "close this dangerous loophole and save lives," Nadler said.\par \par \uc2 Collins, the top Republican on the Judiciary panel, said the bill "foolishly presumes criminals who flout existing laws will suddenly submit themselves to background checks."\par \par \uc2 Democrats and other bill supporters are "delusional" if they think "a criminal trading cocaine to another criminal for a firearm will reconsider due to" the background checks bill, he said.\par \par \uc2 But Kris Brown, president of Brady, a gun control group formerly known as the \uc2 Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence\uc2 , said the bill will save lives.\par \par \uc2 Brown called the House vote "a monumental step forward for gun violence prevention in our country" and hailed Thompson and other lawmakers who pushed for the measure.\par \par \uc2 "On to the Senate!" she said.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writer Lisa Mascaro contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 FILE - In this Jan. 8, 2019, file photo Rep.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 LAS VEGAS (AP) \u8212\'20\'14 A man suspected of being in the U.S. illegally shot and killed four people in Nevada over the past two weeks, including an elderly Reno couple, authorities said, and the slayings added fuel to the immigration debate.\par \par \uc2 Wilbur Ernesto Martinez-Guzman, 19, from El Salvador, has been jailed in Carson City since Saturday on possession of stolen property, burglary and immigration charges. Authorities said they expect to file murder charges against him in Reno in the shooting deaths of a Washoe County couple and in Douglas County in the slayings of two women in Gardnerville.\par \par \uc2 Carson City Sheriff Ken Furlong said federal immigration authorities told his office that Martinez-Guzman was in the country illegally. \uc2 Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2  did not have details on his entry into the U.S.\par \par \uc2 The investigation is ongoing, the sheriff said, and it was too early to comment on a possible motive.\par \par \uc2 Investigators who had been tracking Martinez-Guzman considered him "an imminent threat" when they arrested him Saturday afternoon in the parking lot of a shopping mall.\par \par \uc2 "We couldn't account for him Friday night, and we couldn't predict what he would do Saturday night," Furlong told The Associated Press. "It was too great a risk to the public not to make the arrest."\par \par \uc2 Detectives had watched Martinez-Guzman go to a car wash and trash bins, raising concern that he might try to dispose of evidence connected to the slayings. He did not have a weapon when he was handcuffed, the sheriff said.\par \par \uc2 The suspect did not yet have an attorney who could speak on his behalf, according to the sheriff.\par \par \uc2 President \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  seized on the killings as evidence of the need for his proposed U.S.-Mexico border wall.\par \par \uc2 "Four people in Nevada viciously robbed and killed by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who should not have been in our Country," Trump said Monday in a tweet. "We need a powerful Wall!"\par \par \uc2 The killings are the latest crimes Trump has cited to bring attention to the wall, which is at the center of his battle with Democrats that has shut down much of the federal government.\par \par \uc2 Since the start of his presidency, he has highlighted crimes committed by immigrants who were here illegally, including the killing of a 32-year-old woman at a San Francisco pier in 2015. Last month, he tweeted about allegations that a man from Mexico fatally shot a California police officer.\par \par \uc2 Many academics and Trump's critics have pushed back on the president's narrative, citing studies that have found that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than people born in the United States.\par \par \uc2 The Nevada suspect, who was due in court Thursday, had lived in the Carson City area for about a year. His only known infraction was a speeding ticket, the sheriff said.\par \par \uc2 "We have no information this guy has ever been on anyone's radar," Furlong said.\par \par \uc2 The investigation began Jan. 10, when 56-year-old Connie Koontz was found dead in her home. Three days later, the body of 74-year-old Sophia Renken was discovered in her home about a mile (1.6 kilometers) from where Koontz lived, authorities said.\par \par \uc2 On Jan. 16, the bodies of 81-year-old Gerald David and his 80-year-old wife, Sharon, were found in their home on the southern edge of Reno.\par \par \uc2 The two were remembered as "jovial" by Tom Cates, a longtime friend who knew the Davids through Reno's rodeo and equestrian scene.\par \par \uc2 Cates said Gerald David used his time as the Reno Rodeo Association president in 2006 to promote a breast cancer awareness campaign by getting the group's cowboys to show they were "tough enough to wear pink shirts."\par \par \uc2 "You walk into a room and his presence will just command attention. He was a true leader," Cates said.\par \par \uc2 Sharon David was "exuberant" and "bubbly" and "loved animals to the hills," he said. She was a former director of the rodeo.\par \par \uc2 Renken belonged to an antique automobile club and was known as the friendly driver of a \uc2 Ford\uc2  Model A who was always volunteering to help.\par \par \uc2 Robin Reedy, who was also in the Carson-Tahoe Region of the Antique Automobile Club of America, said she was surprised to learn Renken's age.\par \par \uc2 "I would never have known she was 74 by the way she acted," she said.\par \par \uc2 Koontz, who worked at a \uc2 Walmart\uc2  and as a manicurist at a local salon, was remembered by co-workers Tuesday as a positive woman who loved wearing bright colors. Her \uc2 Walmart\uc2  colleagues wore memorial buttons with her picture.\par \par \uc2 She was "the only person I know that could come to work wearing lime green glasses and lime green crocs and rock it," said Teri Bower, who works at the store.\par \par \uc2 Koontz and her daughter were best friends, Bower said, and the mother had saved up money and surprised her daughter with a trip to Las Vegas for her 21st birthday in December.\par \par \uc2 Bower said the killings had shaken the quiet community where everyone knows everyone and big news is a pending storm "or a bear running down Main Street."\par \par \uc2 "This does not happen around here," Bower said. "It's crazy."\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 This story has been updated to correct the suspect's age to 19, not 20.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writers Regina Garcia Cano in Las Vegas, Elliot Spagat in San Diego and AP researcher Rhonda Shafner in New York contributed to this story.\par \par \uc2 This undated photo provided by the Carson City Sheriff's Office in Carson City, Nev., shows suspect Wilbur Martinez-Guzman.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 A transcript of President \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 's Tuesday night address about security along the U.S. southern border, as provided by the White House:\par \par \uc2 My fellow Americans: Tonight, I am speaking to you because there is a growing humanitarian and security crisis at our southern border.\par \par \uc2 Every day, Customs and Border Patrol agents encounter thousands of illegal immigrants trying to enter our country. We are out of space to hold them, and we have no way to promptly return them back home to their country.\par \par \uc2 America proudly welcomes millions of lawful immigrants who enrich our society and contribute to our nation. But all Americans are hurt by uncontrolled, illegal migration. It strains public resources and drives down jobs and wages. Among those hardest hit are African Americans and Hispanic Americans.\par \par \uc2 Our southern border is a pipeline for vast quantities of illegal drugs, including meth, heroin, cocaine, and fentanyl. Every week, 300 of our citizens are killed by heroin alone, 90 percent of which floods across from our southern border. More Americans will die from drugs this year than were killed in the entire Vietnam War.\par \par \uc2 In the last two years, ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of aliens with criminal records, including those charged or convicted of 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 violent killings. Over the years, thousands of Americans have been brutally killed by those who illegally entered our country, and thousands more lives will be lost if we don't act right now.\par \par \uc2 This is a humanitarian crisis \u8212\'20\'14 a crisis of the heart and a crisis of the soul.\par \par \uc2 Last month, 20,000 migrant children were illegally brought into the United States \u8212\'20\'14 a dramatic increase. These children are used as human pawns by vicious coyotes and ruthless gangs. One in three women are sexually assaulted on the dangerous trek up through Mexico. Women and children are the biggest victims, by far, of our broken system.\par \par \uc2 This is the tragic reality of illegal immigration on our southern border. This is the cycle of human suffering that I am determined to end.\par \par \uc2 My administration has presented Congress with a detailed proposal to secure the border and stop the criminal gangs, drug smugglers, and human traffickers. It's a tremendous problem. Our proposal was developed by law enforcement professionals and border agents at the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2 . These are the resources they have requested to properly perform their mission and keep America safe. In fact, safer than ever before.\par \par \uc2 The proposal from Homeland Security includes cutting-edge technology for detecting drugs, weapons, illegal contraband, and many other things. We have requested more agents, immigration judges, and bed space to process the sharp rise in unlawful migration fueled by our very strong economy. Our plan also contains an urgent request for humanitarian assistance and medical support.\par \par \uc2 Furthermore, we have asked Congress to close border security loopholes so that \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  children can be safely and humanely returned back home.\par \par \uc2 Finally, as part of an overall approach to border security, law enforcement professionals have requested $5.7 billion for a physical barrier. At the request of Democrats, it will be a steel barrier rather than a concrete wall. This barrier is absolutely critical to border security. It's also what our professionals at the border want and need. This is just common sense.\par \par \uc2 The border wall would very quickly pay for itself. The cost of illegal drugs exceeds $500 billion a year \u8212\'20\'14 vastly more than the $5.7 billion we have requested from Congress. The wall will also be paid for, indirectly, by the great new trade deal we have made with Mexico.\par \par \uc2 Sen. Chuck Schumer\uc2  \u8212\'20\'14 who you will be hearing from later tonight \u8212\'20\'14 has repeatedly supported a physical barrier in the past, along with many other Democrats. They changed their mind only after I was elected President.\par \par \uc2 Democrats in Congress have refused to acknowledge the crisis. And they have refused to provide our brave border agents with the tools they desperately need to protect our families and our nation.\par \par \uc2 The federal government remains shut down for one reason and one reason only: because Democrats will not fund border security.\par \par \uc2 My administration is doing everything in our power to help those impacted by the situation. But the only solution is for Democrats to pass a spending bill that defends our borders and re-opens the government.\par \par \uc2 This situation could be solved in a 45-minute meeting. I have invited Congressional leadership to the White House tomorrow to get this done. Hopefully, we can rise above partisan politics in order to support national security.\par \par \uc2 Some have suggested a barrier is immoral. Then why do wealthy politicians build walls, fences, and gates around their homes? They don't build walls because they hate the people on the outside, but because they love the people on the inside. The only thing that is immoral is the politicians to do nothing and continue to allow more innocent people to be so horribly victimized.\par \par \uc2 America's heart broke the day after Christmas when a young police officer in California was savagely murdered in cold blood by an illegal alien, who just came across the border. The life of an American hero was stolen by someone who had no right to be in our country.\par \par \uc2 Day after day, precious lives are cut short by those who have violated our borders. In California, an Air Force veteran was raped, murdered, and beaten to death with a hammer by an illegal alien with a long criminal history. In Georgia, an illegal alien was recently charged with murder for killing, beheading, and dismembering his neighbor. In Maryland, MS-13 gang members who arrived in the United States as unaccompanied minors were arrested and charged last year after viciously stabbing and beating a 16-year-old girl.\par \par \uc2 Over the last several years, I've met with dozens of families whose loved ones were stolen by illegal immigration. I've held the hands of the weeping mothers and embraced the grief-stricken fathers. So sad. So terrible. I will never forget the pain in their eyes, the tremble in their voices, and the sadness gripping their souls.\par \par \uc2 How much more American blood must we shed before Congress does its job?\par \par \uc2 To those who refuse to compromise in the name of border security, I would ask: Imagine if it was your child, your husband, or your wife whose life was so cruelly shattered and totally broken?\par \par \uc2 To every member of Congress: Pass a bill that ends this crisis.\par \par \uc2 To every citizen: Call Congress and tell them to finally, after all of these decades, secure our border.\par \par \uc2 This is a choice between right and wrong, justice and injustice. This is about whether we fulfill our sacred duty to the American citizens we serve.\par \par \uc2 When I took the oath of office, I swore to protect our country. And that is what I will always do, so help me God.\par \par \uc2 Thank you and goodnight.\par \par \uc2 President Donald Trump is seen on monitors in the briefing room of the White House in Washington, as he gives a prime-time address in the Oval Office, Tuesday, Jan. 8, 2019.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) \u8212\'20\'14 At immigration court on the 5th floor of a downtown office building, Judge Glen R. Baker spent a Tuesday morning setting court dates for 40 immigrants before him facing possible deportation.\par \par \uc2 For those making a first appearance, he encouraged they seek a lawyer and return in five or six months.\par \par \uc2 That's just for starters. Once represented, many can expect delays lasting years, The Kansas City Star reports.\par \par \uc2 "Can we schedule this for April 6, 2022, at 10:30 a.m.?" he asked lawyer Catalina Velarde, there on behalf of an undocumented Kansan named Jose Chavez-Larin seeking asylum from El Salvador.\par \par \uc2 "That will work," Velarde said.\par \par \uc2 As is the issue with immigration cases around the country, Velarde accepted the far-off trial date not knowing where her clients might be living then, where her own career may lead, or if laws could change to benefit or further harm people living illegally in the United States.\par \par \uc2 All the result of a deepening backlog in cases stressing the nation's immigration courts.\par \par \uc2 President \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 's administration has taken steps to whittle down the backlog, now numbering more than 760,000 unresolved cases. Since he took office, the \uc2 Executive Office for Immigration Review\uc2  has added 46 immigration judges nationwide, a 30 percent increase.\par \par \uc2 Yet arrests by \uc2 Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) \uc2 are climbing even faster, about 40 percent higher than in 2016, further expanding the judicial caseload.\par \par \uc2 For now the backlog is seen mostly as a boon to those trying to avoid deportation. And for that reason, they're reluctant to talk with news media about delays in their cases.\par \par \uc2 After all, a Kansas City hearing set for 2022 \u8212\'20\'14 and delays can be even longer in other U.S. jurisdictions \u8212\'20\'14 gives the undocumented time to gain income, marry a U.S. citizen, establish themselves in a community and build a case that a forced return to a native country would damage their families.\par \par \uc2 "I don't control trial dates," said attorney Velarde, adding that it's possible future years could offer a better scenario for the undocumented. "Right now the law is not favorable."\par \par \uc2 But long waits between hearings present "positives and negatives" for the clients of local immigration lawyer Matthew Hoppock.\par \par \uc2 Minor children who may face irreparable hardship if a parent is deported can become adults by trial time, weakening the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  parent's case for staying.\par \par \uc2 The death of a frail parent dependent on the care of a person fighting deportation does the same.\par \par \uc2 For migrants ordered to wear electronic ankle monitors that track their whereabouts, "waiting one year or waiting six years makes a difference," Hoppock added. "It's really stigmatizing. Every day you go to work, you go to church, people can see that (monitor) around your ankle."\par \par \uc2 Depending on the circumstances of each case, Hoppock said many defendants are wise to request an expedited hearing, which judges must try to schedule within about six months when asked.\par \par \uc2 Yet that could mean being deported years sooner than later.\par \par \uc2 Judges' quota\par \par \uc2 As of late September, an average of 718 days marked the time between the \uc2 U.S. Department of Homeland Security\uc2  initiating removal proceedings and when a case was closed, according to a \uc2 Syracuse University\uc2  nonprofit tracking the backlog.\par \par \uc2 By now the average delay may be even longer, and longer yet next year, said Syracuse's Sue Long, a professor of managerial studies. "The backlog keeps going up and up and up."\par \par \uc2 And it varies by region. In the Kansas City region served by the federal immigration court on Grand Boulevard, cases are taking an average of 580 days to be closed. In Colorado, 1,045 days.\par \par \uc2 The Department of Justice has set a goal of slashing the backlog in half by 2020, by continuing to hire judges and requiring that each close 700 cases a year. Judge Baker in Kansas City said he was confident that he and the two other local judges can meet that quota.\par \par \uc2 Others denounce the quota, which took effect in October. The policy "will force judges to choose between guaranteeing justice or losing their jobs," said Anastasia Tonello, president of the \uc2 American Immigration Lawyers Association\uc2 . "With a clock constantly ticking over their heads, judges cannot possibly issue well-reasoned decisions."\par \par \uc2 But something has to change, said Andrew Arthur of the Center for Immigration Studies, which supports a speedier process for arresting and removing undocumented migrants.\par \par \uc2 "When you allow these court continuances to fester, that just encourages more people to come to the U.S.," he said.\par \par \uc2 Lawyers' dilemma\par \par \uc2 In late November, longtime Lawrence chemist \uc2 Syed Jamal\uc2  learned his trial date to seek asylum: April 27, 2022.\par \par \uc2 He said he had "mixed feelings" about it. The wait leaves up in the air the future legal status of Jamal, a native Bangladeshi whose fight to avoid deportation earlier this year gained global attention after his arrest while taking a daughter to school.\par \par \uc2 On the other hand, the delay gives him and his attorneys "more time to prepare for the best," he said.\par \par \uc2 But anything can happen in that time, as local immigration attorneys will attest.\par \par \uc2 Clients vanish. Lawyers move away or, feeling overwhelmed by their caseloads, close their businesses.\par \par \uc2 And by 2022, Trump may or may not be president.\par \par \uc2 "Hey, I'm thinking retirement," said Kansas City attorney Angela Ferguson. "I don't want to be committed to trials five years from now."\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 Information from: The Kansas City Star, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.kcstar.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.kcstar.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020181211eecb00zyi\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The Salina Journal, Nov. 25\par \par \uc2 We do little to encourage voting\par \par \uc2 Long before President Clinton signed the National Voter Registration Act in 1993, Kansas was leading a charge to get citizens to the polls.\par \par \uc2 For decades, our secretaries of state campaigned for such reforms as advance voting, mailed ballots, more voting stations, greater access for registration, simpler rules and ID requirements. In the 1960s and '70s a campaign for easier access was led by Kansas Secretary of State Elwill Shanahan; more reforms came under secretaries Jack Brier (1980s), \uc2 Bill Graves\uc2  ('80s-'90s) and Ron Thornburgh ('90s-2010).\par \par \uc2 All that has changed.\par \par \uc2 In 2013 the \uc2 U.S. Supreme Court\uc2  struck down a provision of the Voting Rights Act that had required federal clearance for a state to make substantive changes in its voting laws; the idea was to keep an eye on the Jim Crow states that favored discrimination. But the Court held a naive belief that roughly a half-dozen targeted states had outgrown the need for federal watch on their election habits. They were set free of federal "preclearance." The rest could do as they pleased.\par \par \uc2 The trouble, as we have learned, was not limited to the south.\par \par \uc2 Immigration is now an issue salted with racial overtones. It has invited fear-based campaigns for election "reform" with renewed discriminations \u8212\'20\'14 a suffocating voter ID process, more gerrymandering, fiddling with polling place locations, schedules and equipment, among others.\par \par \uc2 Almost overnight, citizens were required to prove, in new multiple layers, that they were eligible to vote \u8212\'20\'14 or for many, white enough to vote. Hispanic Dodge City, with its single polling place moved out of town; Barton County, using polling places like peas in a shell game, are prime examples.\par \par \uc2 Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach led the charge. He persuaded voters that hordes of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  "aliens" were about to swarm over our borders and corrupt our elections. For Kansas, this meant two-tier elections: one ballot \u8212\'20\'14 federal \u8212\'20\'14 for the less privileged and another \u8212\'20\'14 with both federal and state candidates \u8212\'20\'14 for the more fortunate. The law was vaporized in federal court, but not until after several elections with thousands of voters denied true ballots, and tens of thousands purged from registration lists.\par \par \uc2 This shame is not a Kansas franchise. Injustice is shared among other states that have found ways to prevent certain citizens from voting.\par \par \uc2 Small wonder that the United States ranks 26th of 32 developed democratic nations in voter turnout. Our 49 percent participation is pathetic compared with, say, Belgium (87 percent), Sweden (83 percent), and Australia (79 percent). These and other more civilized countries do not throw obstacles in the way of voters, they encourage participation.\par \par \uc2 In the last election, more than 50 million Americans, and nearly a million Kansans, either weren't registered or didn't vote. Yet we bragged about our high turnout.\par \par \uc2 How can we improve?\par \par \uc2 We've begun by showing Kris Kobach the door. The next step is to encourage more registration without all the roadblocks. On the federal level, Congress must renew the attack on gerrymandering and laws that suppress even the inclination to vote.\par \par \uc2 If we're really serious about our "democracy," we could embrace automatic registration for all citizens at age 18, as happens in the more progressive countries. Next, we can have elections at a more convenient time than on Tuesday of a work week. We might even make a national holiday of voting; it's that important.\par \par \uc2 Thomas Paine, a founder of our country, said voting is "the primary right by which all others are protected."\par \par \uc2 Without more of that protection, we remain open to tyranny, to rule by a minority of voters.\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 The Kansas City Star, Nov. 25\par \par \uc2 Kansas child welfare agency could put kids at risk with ill-advised contract\par \par \uc2 One of Kansas Governor-elect \uc2 Laura Kelly\uc2 's first major decisions will be whether to invite the secretary of the Department of Children and Families to stay on in her administration.\par \par \uc2 It won't be an easy call.\par \par \uc2 Secretary Gina Meier-Hummel, who just completed her first year on the job, has done a lot of good things. She's taken steps to shed her department's cloak of secrecy. She's ordered top-down studies of the agency and halted the practice of children spending nights in agency offices.\par \par \uc2 She's done all this even though the agency is severely underfunded and relies on an outdated computer system that puts kids at risk.\par \par \uc2 But then her agency makes a decision like the one The Star recently disclosed. Meier-Hummel's department awarded a Florida nonprofit a four-year contract for critical family preservation services, which aim to keep children out of foster care. The nonprofit, though, is plagued by many of the same problems that DCF has struggled with in recent years.\par \par \uc2 Among them: foster kids sleeping in offices and spending too much time unsupervised after school; foster kids spending night after night in various homes, endangering their welfare; foster kids dying of abuse and neglect.\par \par \uc2 The reaction, understandably, is one of bewilderment and frustration.\par \par \uc2 "As a state, we're going to hire a company with the exact same headlines we're trying to get away from?" an exasperated state Rep. Jarrod Ousley, a Merriam Democrat, asked when told of the hire. "I thought we were trying to be better."\par \par \uc2 "Oh, brother. I'm disappointed to hear that," said House Majority Leader Don Hineman, a Dighton Republican.\par \par \uc2 As The Star reported, Eckerd Connects will provide family preservation services in three of Kansas' four regions. The one region that Eckerd won't oversee is the Kansas City area.\par \par \uc2 In Florida, the problems were so severe that the state threatened to take away Eckerd's $77 million annual contract unless it developed a corrective plan.\par \par \uc2 DCF has acknowledged that it was aware of Eckerd's issues in Florida. But officials noted that the nonprofit wasn't awarded a grant for foster care, but for family preservation. Eckerd already provides some services in Kansas and reportedly has been doing a good job.\par \par \uc2 DCF officials also insisted that comparing Florida foster care services with Kansas family preservation isn't valid because they are different. "They will be serving Kansas children and families in a completely different way," a DCF spokesman said.\par \par \uc2 That's hardly comforting, given that we're talking about kids under enormous stress now dealing with an agency with a lousy track record. With Meier-Hummel's future uncertain, this decision doesn't inspire confidence.\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 The Iola Register, Nov. 26\par \par \uc2 Kobach's departure emboldens Topeka\par \par \uc2 Now that Kris Kobach is on his way out, Kansas officials have rediscovered their backbones.\par \par \uc2 Last Monday, Attorney General Derek Schmidt announced his intention to take back the authority to prosecute cases of voter fraud from that of the Secretary of State.\par \par \uc2 In 2015, both houses of the Kansas legislature voted to make Kobach the only secretary of state in the country to have the power to file criminal charges against voter fraud as well as stiffen penalties for several voting offenses from misdemeanors to felonies.\par \par \uc2 In the years since, Kobach has not been able to prove more than a few cases of voter fraud with little more than slaps on the hand as follow-up. One wonders why Schmidt has changed course weeks after Kobach lost his bid to be governor. Did Schmidt realize that voter fraud isn't a real issue? Or perhaps he simply went along with Kobach, wary of angering a future governor. What else could account for his sudden change of conviction now that Kobach is on his way out the door?\par \par \uc2 Though he voted as a state representative to give Kobach such prosecutorial powers, Scott Schwab, incoming secretary of state, also says he's changed his mind about the wiseness of that move and is more than happy to hand them back over to those more experienced in such matters.\par \par \uc2 Which is as it should be.\par \par \uc2 Of the almost 2 million registered voters in Kansas, only a dozen have been found to be registered improperly, mostly due to clerical errors or recent changes of address, not intentional fraud. Kobach has brushed off the defeats as inconsequential because his focus all along has been on gaining national attention as a voting fraud czar. He is a king of fear-mongering, wanting us to feel our rights as citizens are being threatened by outside forces, even though the truth is otherwise.\par \par \uc2 In 2013, a good number of legislators approved Kobach's efforts to make voting more restrictive by requiring voters prove their U.S. citizenship. In the 2016 election, an estimated 35,000 Kansans were prevented from registering to vote because of the new law, the strictest in the nation. The law was ruled unconstitutional by U.S. District Judge Julie A. Robinson last June.\par \par \uc2 Attorney General Schmidt has agreed to appeal Judge Robinson's ruling, which should cause Kansans to question why he still believes in spending his office's time and our tax dollars on Kobach's solution in search of a problem.\par \par \uc2 Schmidt could ease our consciences by not only saying that upon review the case is without merit, but also by making the break between he and Kobach's policies crystal clear. Until then, doubts can't help but persist as to what side of the fence Schmidt sits.\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020181127eebr00qp7\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

And it includes footage of Luis Bracamontes, a twice-deported immigrant from Mexico sentenced to death in California for killing two police officers.\par \par \uc2 "Dangerous illegal criminals like cop-killer Luis Bracamontes don't care about our laws," the narrator says against footage of the caravan, which remains hundreds of miles from the southern border. "America cannot allow this invasion. The migrant caravan must be stopped."\par \par \uc2 The decision to use the footage in an official campaign ad is the latest of Trump's election-week efforts to stoke fear and anti-immigrant sentiment in hopes of motivating Republicans to vote Tuesday. And it comes amid a frenzy of hardline immigration proposals he has pushed in the final stages of the campaign, including sending troops to the border and revoking birthright citizenship.\par \par \uc2 Bracamontes was also featured in an ad Trump tweeted Wednesday that was widely seen as reminiscent of the infamous 1988 "Willie Horton" ad used against Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis and condemned as racist.\par \par \uc2 Trump had said earlier Friday the video was tough "but correct."\par \par \uc2 "I don't view it as the Willie Horton ad at all," the president told The \uc2 Washington Times\uc2  in an interview published Friday. "I think it's just an ad where somebody is a bad guy, came in illegally, twice, and we can't do that."\par \par \uc2 Parscale said the new ad would start running nationally Friday night and the campaign had purchased $1.5 million in airtime to run it.\par \par \uc2 It stands in stark contrast to an ad released by the Trump campaign earlier in the week that highlighted rosy economic numbers and depicted gauzy scenes of American suburban life. That ad was part of a blitz by Trump's campaign, and Parscale did several interviews to promote it.\par \par \uc2 The conservative Breitbart News chronicled Bracamontes' conviction and death sentence.\par \par \uc2 Bracamontes' snarling, expletive-filled courtroom rant about killing police officers appeared in a little-noticed January 2018 Trump campaign ad. Bracamontes sports a shaved head and long chin hair in the video. He speaks in accented English, and his words are clear: He's killed cops and he's "gonna kill more cops soon."\par \par \uc2 The original video alleges without evidence that Democrats were responsible for allowing Bracamontes into the U.S. Bracamontes was sentenced to death in California for the 2014 killings.\par \par \uc2 "\uc2 Illegal immigrant\uc2 , Luis Bracamontes, killed our people!" the video states, adding, "Democrats let him into our country ... Democrats let him stay." It includes scenes of a migrant caravan moving toward the U.S., asks, "Who else would Democrats let in?" and suggests that more violence would soon penetrate the border.\par \par \uc2 While the first video did not appear be running on television, it received extensive coverage on cable news networks. As of Thursday afternoon, it had received 3.51 million views in less than 24 hours and was the "pinned" tweet atop Trump's profile, making it the first thing any visitor to his Twitter page would see.\par \par \uc2 The White House and the Trump campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comments as to who made or paid for the video or if any tax dollars were used to run it from the president's account.\par \par \uc2 "This is a sickening ad. Republicans everywhere should denounce it," said Republican \uc2 Sen. Jeff Flake\uc2  of Arizona, a frequent Trump critic. And \uc2 Rep. Carlos Curbelo\uc2 , R-Fla., seeking re-election in a Democratic-leaning South Florida district, said he'd not seen the video but criticized Trump's use of it.\par \par \uc2 "I can tell you that it's definitely part of a divide-and-conquer strategy that a lot of politicians, including the president, have used successfully in the past," Curbelo said Thursday on \uc2 CNN\uc2 . "I hope this doesn't work."\par \par \uc2 Tom Perez\uc2 , chairman of the Democratic National Committee, called the new ad the "dog whistle of all dog whistles."\par \par \uc2 "This is distracting, divisive Donald at his worst," Perez said on \uc2 CNN\uc2 . "This is fearmongering."\par \par \uc2 But the Trump campaign was behind the January 2018 video, released on its \uc2 YouTube\uc2  page, that featured Bracamontes' courtroom appearance. That video was timed to the one-year anniversary of Trump's inauguration and meant to promote his immigration agenda.\par \par \uc2 The previous year, Jessica Davis and Susan Oliver, the widows of Detective Michael Davis and Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver, were invited to Trump's address to Congress. Bracamontes' case \u8212\'20\'14 he was sentenced to death in March \u8212\'20\'14 also received steady coverage on Breitbart and other right-wing news sites.\par \par \uc2 Trump has long promoted the alleged danger presented by those living in the country illegally, although statistics show they do not commit crimes at a higher rate than citizens. During his 2016 campaign, he frequently appeared with so-called "angel families" \u8212\'20\'14 those who lost loved ones at the hands of immigrants in the nation illegally.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 Follow Lemire on Twitter at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://twitter.com/@JonLemire"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://twitter.com/@JonLemire}}}\uc2  and Miller at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://twitter.com/@zekejmiller"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://twitter.com/@zekejmiller}}}\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 For AP's complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://apne.ws/APPolitics"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://apne.ws/APPolitics}}}\par \par \uc2 President Donald Trump arrives for a campaign rally at Southport High School, Friday, Nov. 2, 2018, in Indianapolis.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 COLUMBIA, Mo. (AP) \u8212\'20\'14 President \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  implored voters on Thursday to reject Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill and to instead install a Republican in her seat who would fully back his agenda.\par \par \uc2 Trump appeared at a rollicking campaign rally in Columbia, home of the state's largest university, in an airline hangar draped in American flags. It was his second rally in an 11-stop, eight-state tour designed to boost Republican turnout ahead of Tuesday's crucial midterm elections.\par \par \uc2 The president, accompanied by McCaskill's Republican challenger, \uc2 Josh Hawley\uc2 , declared that Hawley "will be a star."\par \par \uc2 Hawley, the current attorney general, sought to link McCaskill to Trump's Democratic opponent, \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 , who lost the state in 2016 by nearly 19 percentage points.\par \par \uc2 "Claire McCaskill has spent her lifetime in politics just like Hillary," Hawley said. "Claire McCaskill wanted us to call \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  'Madam President.' On Nov. 6, we're going to call Claire McCaskill 'fired.'"\par \par \uc2 With four days to go until midterm elections that determine control of Congress, Republicans are optimistic they could make gains in the Senate, but they might struggle to maintain a majority in the House.\par \par \uc2 McCaskill is among a number of vulnerable Democrats running in red states. She is a top target for Republicans seeking to expand the party's slim 51-49 edge in the \uc2 U.S. Senate\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 McCaskill is pitching herself as a moderate as she seeks to hold onto her seat. She has sought to distance herself from "crazy Democrats" and said in an appearance on Fox News that she supports Trump's efforts to secure the southern border. Hawley has dismissed her efforts and argues that she is not the right fit for an increasingly conservative state.\par \par \uc2 Trump said that McCaskill had been "saying such nice things about me. But you know what? She'll never vote with me. That's the problem."\par \par \uc2 A check of her record, however, shows that McCaskill votes with the president about half the time, though she has opposed him on some key issues, including his tax cuts and the recent confirmation of Supreme Court Justice \uc2 Brett Kavanaugh\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The president, who this week threatened to end a constitutional right that automatically grants citizenship to any baby born in the United States, railed against the 14th Amendment during the Thursday rally, calling it a "crazy, lunatic policy" supported by Democrats.\par \par \uc2 "The Democrats want to continue giving automatic birthright citizenship to every child born to an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , even if they've been on our soil for a mere matter of seconds," Trump said. "Hundreds of thousands of children born to illegal immigrants are made automatic citizens of the United States every year because of this crazy, lunatic policy that we can end."\par \par \uc2 The non-partisan \uc2 Migration Policy Institute\uc2  estimates that there are more than 4 million U.S.-born children under the age of 18 who have an unauthorized immigrant parent. Most legal scholars say it would take a new constitutional amendment to alter the current one granting citizenship to anyone born in America.\par \par \uc2 Trump expressed optimism for the midterm elections, though he noted that Republican momentum had been blunted in recent days by "two maniacs" \u8212\'20\'14 a reference to a mail bomb scare and a mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue. He added, "More importantly, we have to take care of our people. And we don't care about momentum when it comes to a disgrace like just happened to our country."\par \par \uc2 However, he said, "It did nevertheless stop a certain momentum. And now the momentum is picking up."\par \par \uc2 The president will return to Missouri before Election Day, rallying voters Monday in Cape Girardeau.\par \par \uc2 President Donald Trump arrives to speak at a campaign rally at Columbia Regional Airport, Thursday, Nov. 1, 2018, in Columbia, Mo.

He offered few details on how exactly he planned to overhaul an asylum system he claimed was plagued by "endemic abuse" that he said "makes a mockery of our immigration system."\par \par \uc2 __\par \par \uc2 4:50 p.m.\par \par \uc2 President \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  says he told the U.S. military mobilizing at the Southwest border that if migrants try to throw rocks at them, the troops should act as though the rocks are "rifles."\par \par \uc2 Trump made the comments Thursday in a speech on immigration. He promised an executive order sometime next week that would ban migrants from claiming asylum if they cross the border illegally, and would set up vast tent cities that would hold anyone coming over the border.\par \par \uc2 U.S. immigration laws say migrants seeking asylum can do so no matter how they arrive at the U.S.\par \par \uc2 Several caravans of migrants from Central America are slowly winding north. One group got into a violent confrontation with Mexican police at the border with Guatemala, throwing rocks.\par \par \uc2 __\par \par \uc2 4:40 p.m.\par \par \uc2 President \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  says asylum seekers must go to ports of entry in order to make a claim. He says he will issue an executive order next week on immigration.\par \par \uc2 In a lengthy speech Thursday, Trump said migrants are abusing the asylum system and making a "mockery" of immigration laws.\par \par \uc2 Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, migrants claiming asylum are allowed to do so at the border crossings, but also if they cross illegally.\par \par \uc2 Trump reiterated that he wanted to set up "tent cities" to hold people coming to the U.S., including those seeking asylum. But there currently is not enough detention space to hold families who are coming across the border. The military is working to create space, but nothing has been finalized. And laws prevent children from being detained beyond 20 days.\par \par \uc2 __\par \par \uc2 4:10 p.m.\par \par \uc2 A U.S. official says the first 100 or so active-duty troops have arrived at the U.S.-Mexican border, to provide support for border patrol agents as a caravan of migrants slowly makes its way north.\par \par \uc2 The troops are doing initial assessments at the port of entry in McAllen, Texas. The official says there are about 2,600 U.S. troops now at staging bases, largely in Texas, with several thousand more expected to flow in through the weekend and move into California and Arizona.\par \par \uc2 The official spoke on condition of anonymity to provide details not yet released.\par \par \uc2 The Pentagon says more than 7,000 active-duty troops are being sent to the Southwest border, with more possible. President \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  has said the number could reach 15,000.\par \par \uc2 The caravan of migrants is still hundreds of miles from the border.\par \par \uc2 __\par \par \uc2 12:55 p.m.\par \par \uc2 President \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  is expected to announce plans to deny asylum to migrants who try to enter the U.S. illegally between ports of entry as part of his latest election season response to two caravans of migrants heading toward the U.S.-Mexico border.\par \par \uc2 That's according to three people familiar with the plans who spoke to The Associated Press on Thursday on the condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak publicly.\par \par \uc2 The White House announced earlier that the president would be making "brief remarks on the illegal immigration crisis" before he departs for a campaign rally in Missouri.\par \par \uc2 It's unclear whether the restrictions would apply only to those traveling in the caravans or would extend beyond the caravans to all people trying to enter the country.\par \par \uc2 The announcement comes as the president has sought to focus attention on immigration while trying to drum up GOP enthusiasm heading into next Tuesday's midterm elections.\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 By Jill Colvin and Colleen Long.\par \par \uc2 ____\par \par \uc2 8:45 a.m.\par \par \uc2 Ahead of the midterm elections, President \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  is tweeting a video alleging Democrats were responsible for allowing a convicted cop killer into the U.S. But he's providing no evidence supporting his claim.\par \par \uc2 The video is reminiscent of the infamous 1988 "Willie Horton" ad used against Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis and condemned as racist.\par \par \uc2 Trump highlighted the case of Luis Bracamontes, a twice-deported immigrant from Mexico sentenced to death in California for killing two police officers.\par \par \uc2 The spot includes expletives uttered by Bracamontes during his trial professing regret at not killing more officials.\par \par \uc2 The captioned reads: "\uc2 Illegal immigrant\uc2 , Luis Bracamontes, killed our people!" It adds: "Democrats let him into our country...Democrats let him stay."\par \par \uc2 The video includes scenes of a migrant "caravan," warning, "Who else would Democrats let in?" Trump provides no evidence linking Democrats to Bracamontes.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 12:50 a.m.\par \par \uc2 President \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  says the number of military troops deployed to the U.S.-Mexico border could reach 15,000.\par \par \uc2 Trump said Wednesday "we'll go up to anywhere between 10 and 15,000 military personnel on top of Border Patrol, ICE and everybody else at the border."\par \par \uc2 Trump says the move would be aimed at preventing the entry of a caravan of migrants traveling from Central America. The caravan is moving on foot and is still nearly 1,000 miles from the border.\par \par \uc2 The troop numbers have changed at a dizzying pace, with Trump drawing a hard line on immigration in the lead-up to the midterm elections.\par \par \uc2 Last week officials indicated 800 to 1,000 troops might be sent. On Monday, they announced about 5,200 were being deployed. The next day an Air Force general rejected a news report it could reach 14,000.\par \par \uc2 President Donald Trump speaks during a campaign rally at Columbia Regional Airport, Thursday, Nov. 1, 2018, in Columbia, Mo.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) \u8212\'20\'14 The widows of two police officers the Mexican immigrant murdered were invited to President \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 's 2017 address to Congress. The conservative Breitbart News faithfully chronicled his conviction and death sentence. His snarling, expletive-filled rant about killing police officers appeared in a little-noticed January 2018 Trump campaign ad.\par \par \uc2 Now, Luis Bracamontes' menacing smile has abruptly taken a central role in Trump's closing midterm election argument about immigration as the president tweeted out a video of the Latino man's courtroom appearance in what was immediately denounced by some Democrats and Republicans as a racist campaign tactic.\par \par \uc2 Bracamontes, an immigrant living in the country illegally, sports a shaved head and long chin hair and speaks in accented English in the video, and his words are clear: He's killed cops and he's "gonna kill more cops soon."\par \par \uc2 The video , which Trump tweeted late Wednesday, alleges without evidence that Democrats were responsible for allowing Bracamontes into the U.S. It comes amid a frenzy of hardline immigration proposals pushed out by Trump in the final stages of the campaign, including sending troops to the border and revoking birthright citizenship.\par \par \uc2 Bracamontes, a twice-deported immigrant from Mexico, was sentenced to death in California for the 2014 killings. The 53-second video includes expletives uttered by Bracamontes during his trial as he professed regret at not killing more officers.\par \par \uc2 "\uc2 Illegal immigrant\uc2 , Luis Bracamontes, killed our people!," the video states, adding, "Democrats let him into our country ... Democrats let him stay." It includes scenes of a migrant caravan moving toward the U.S., warning ominously, "Who else would Democrats let in?" and suggesting that more violence would soon penetrate the border.\par \par \uc2 The ad was reminiscent of the infamous "Willie Horton" ad used against Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis in 1988 and condemned as racist. Horton, who was black, raped a woman while out of prison on a weekend furlough. As Massachusetts governor, Dukakis supported the furlough program. Dukakis went on to lose to Republican George H.W. Bush.\par \par \uc2 The video tweeted by Trump did not immediately appear to be running on television \u8212\'20\'14 it has a runtime longer than most TV ads \u8212\'20\'14 although it received extensive coverage on cable news networks. As of Thursday afternoon, it had received 3.51 million views in less than 24 hours and was the "pinned" tweet atop Trump's profile, meaning it was the first thing any visitor to his Twitter page would see.\par \par \uc2 The White House and the Trump campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comments as to who made or paid for the video or if any tax dollars were used to run it from the president's account.\par \par \uc2 "This is a sickening ad. Republicans everywhere should denounce it," said Republican \uc2 Sen. Jeff Flake\uc2  of Arizona, a frequent Trump critic. And \uc2 Rep. Carlos Curbelo\uc2 , R-Fla., seeking re-election in a Democratic-leaning South Florida district, said he'd not seen the video but criticized Trump's use of it.\par \par \uc2 "I can tell you that it's definitely part of a divide-and-conquer strategy that a lot of politicians, including the president, have used successfully in the past," Curbelo said Thursday on \uc2 CNN\uc2 . "I hope this doesn't work."\par \par \uc2 Tom Perez\uc2 , chairman of the Democratic National Committee, called the new ad the "dog whistle of all dog whistles."\par \par \uc2 "This is distracting, divisive Donald at his worst," Perez said on \uc2 CNN\uc2 . "This is fearmongering."\par \par \uc2 The dark video stood in stark contrast to an ad circulated by the Trump campaign earlier in the week that highlighted rosy economic numbers and depicted gauzy scenes of American suburban life. That ad was part of a blitz by Trump's campaign, and his campaign manager, \uc2 Brad Parscale\uc2 , did several interviews to promote it.\par \par \uc2 As for the new video, though, the campaign was silent Thursday and Parscale did not respond to requests for comment.\par \par \uc2 But the Trump campaign was behind the January 2018 video, released on its \uc2 YouTube\uc2  page, that featured Bracamontes's courtroom appearance. That video was timed to the one-year anniversary of Trump's inauguration and meant to promote his immigration agenda.\par \par \uc2 The previous year, Jessica Davis and Susan Oliver, the widows of Detective Michael Davis and Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver, were invited to Trump's address to Congress. Bracamontes' case \u8212\'20\'14 he was sentenced to death in March \u8212\'20\'14 also received steady coverage on Breitbart and other right-wing news sites.\par \par \uc2 Trump has long promoted the alleged danger presented by those living in the country illegally, although statistics show they do not commit crimes at a higher rate than citizens. During his 2016 campaign, he frequently appeared with so-called "angel families" \u8212\'20\'14 those who lost loved ones at the hands of immigrants in the nation illegally.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 Follow Lemire on Twitter at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://twitter.com/@JonLemire"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://twitter.com/@JonLemire}}}\uc2  and Miller at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://twitter.com/@zekejmiller"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://twitter.com/@zekejmiller}}}\par \par \uc2 President Donald Trump waves as he boards Air Force One for a campaign rally in Columbia, Mo., Thursday, Nov. 1, 2018, in Andrews Air Force Base, Md.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) \u8212\'20\'14 Kris Kobach highlights his national reputation as an immigration crusader in running for Kansas governor by promising voters that if he's elected he'll work to drive out illegal immigrants to halt what he says is the $377 million in benefits provided to them by the state each year.\par \par \uc2 The conservative Republican's plans echo President \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 's crackdown on immigration \u8212\'20\'14 an agenda Kobach has helped to shape. The president has endorsed Kobach , the Kansas secretary of state, who won a narrow primary victory over the state's GOP governor.\par \par \uc2 Plenty of immigration policy analysts suggest Kobach's push could harm the state's economy, but they start by questioning the dollar figure he is citing repeatedly as the annual cost of illegal immigration to Kansas. Kobach is undeterred.\par \par \uc2 "My election would send a signal that the public-benefits gravy train is going to end," Kobach said during a recent interview.\par \par \uc2 While states such as California and Illinois have offered immigrants sanctuary, Kobach wants Kansas to catch up to others including Missouri, Alabama and Arizona in setting policies designed to prevent immigrants living in the U.S. from getting jobs or obtaining benefits. Kobach has falsely described Kansas as the "sanctuary state of the Midwest."\par \par \uc2 His figure for what Kansas could save annually comes from a September 2017 report by the \uc2 Federation for American Immigration Reform\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The group backs Trump's call to build a wall on the border with Mexico and opposes "amnesty," for immigrants living in the U.S. illegally, including a pathway to citizenship for those willing to serve in the military. Its website argues for cutting legal immigration 70 percent and says "immigration levels must fall" for U.S. wages to rise.\par \par \uc2 The group calculated figures for each state by tabulating a 50-state total for various costs and working from an estimate of how many immigrants living illegally in the U.S. reside in each state. FAIR estimated more than 84,000 immigrants live illegally in Kansas; other sources have lower figures. The total is between 2.2 percent and 2.9 percent of Kansas' population.\par \par \uc2 Almost half of the total costs the study cites are for public schooling for immigrant children. But a 1982 decision by the \uc2 U.S. Supreme Court\uc2  prohibits states from denying those children an education.\par \par \uc2 Roughly a third is a combination of policing, court expenses and even general services, such as garbage collection.\par \par \uc2 In short, much of the spending is for services a state can't avoid unless immigrants are deported or leave voluntarily.\par \par \uc2 Kobach acknowledged that he couldn't cut off much spending immediately and might not be able to completely eliminate his $377 million a year entirely over time but maintains reducing it sharply is worth doing. He's outlined multiple proposals for combatting illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 FAIR research director Matt O'Brien, one of the report's authors, said the burden to federal and state governments from providing services "offsets any measurable gain" from money "illegal aliens are alleged to inject into the economy."\par \par \uc2 "In fact, illegal immigration simply amounts to a massive wealth redistribution scheme," O'Brien said in an email.\par \par \uc2 Critics contend the report that Kobach is citing overestimates how many immigrants live in the U.S. illegally and fails to adequately consider immigrant contributions to the economy. A senior policy analyst for the libertarian \uc2 Cato Institute\uc2  called it "fatally flawed" \u8212\'20\'14 and said it might overestimate net government costs by as much as 97 percent.\par \par \uc2 "It's disappointing that a candidate for such an important office is relying on such shoddy research to make his point," said Alex Nowrasteh, the Cato analyst. He argues for allowing "peaceful" immigrants to stay in the U.S. even if they arrived illegally.\par \par \uc2 The Democratic nominee for governor, state \uc2 Sen. Laura Kelly\uc2 , described the FAIR report as "widely discredited," adding in an email, "Kris Kobach is deceiving Kansans to further his personal political agenda."\par \par \uc2 And independent candidate \uc2 Greg Orman\uc2 , a Kansas City-area businessman, said: "We're not going to grow the Kansas economy by driving workers out of the state."\par \par \uc2 Federal law generally prohibits government health coverage and food assistance for illegal immigrants, though Kobach says Kansas is not aggressive enough in policing fraud in those programs.\par \par \uc2 But FAIR argues that costs for states are bigger and include general services that legal residents also receive, as well as the costs of prosecuting and incarcerating \uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2  criminals and medical care that poor immigrant families can't afford but are entitled to by law.\par \par \uc2 In 2016, a study from the \uc2 National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine\uc2  concluded that first-generation immigrants are more costly in the short-term to states and local governments than native U.S. citizens, largely because of education costs. \uc2 Kim Rueben\uc2 , a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, which participated in the academies' study, said immigrant parents have more children on average.\par \par \uc2 But, she added, "Those kids are also going to be the future labor force."\par \par \uc2 Studies by the University of Missouri-Kansas City in 2013 and the \uc2 University of Kansas\uc2  in 2014 concluded that immigrants benefit the Kansas economy and pay for government services they use. Both also concluded that immigrants expand the Kansas economy.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 Follow John Hanna on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 : {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://twitter.com/apjdhanna"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://twitter.com/apjdhanna}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 Sign up for "Politics in Focus," a weekly newsletter showcasing the AP's best political reporting from around the country leading up to the midterm elections: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://bit.ly/2ICEr3D"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://bit.ly/2ICEr3D}}}\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020180914ee9e01f2x\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

Florida's Democratic nominee for governor met Tuesday with investigators from the state ethics commission to discuss the trips.

Skies quickly turned dark gray as storms overshadowed the port city of Mobile, Alabama, just before nightfall. Metal chairs were lashed together atop tables outside a restaurant in what's normally a busy entertainment district, and a street musician played to an empty sidewalk as rain began falling. Forecasters said conditions would further deteriorate westward to New Orleans as the stormed neared shore.

They believe that evidence uncovered in the lawsuit could lead to Calkins being charged criminally.\par \par \uc2 Williams' mother said she filed the lawsuit to get answers for her son's four children. The complaint does not set a dollar amount for damages.\par \par \uc2 "I am not going to let it go until I get the answers that they deserve," Williams said at a press conference, thanking Perry for supporting the family and bringing attention to the case. In 2014, Perry offered a $100,000 reward for information in the men's disappearance. He said it turned up nothing, so he raised the reward Tuesday to $200,000.\par \par \uc2 Perry, best known for his African-American family comedies and his character "Madea," said "race has become such a polarizing" factor nationally, but this case should disturb any person, no matter their color.\par \par \uc2 "We have got to come together to fight injustice, to fight what is wrong," Perry said.\par \par \uc2 Calkins did not return a call seeking comment and no one answered Tuesday at his current home near Cedar Rapids, Iowa. He told investigators in 2004 he dropped both men at a convenience store. He was never charged but the Collier County Sheriff's Office fired him after he stopped cooperating with the investigation. He is white. Santos was from Mexico.\par \par \uc2 Wiliams and Santos disappeared under similar circumstances in this southwest Florida county bordering the Everglades and its alligators.\par \par \uc2 In October 2003, Santos, a construction and farm worker, had been in a fender bender and Calkins took him into custody because he did not have his license and registration.\par \par \uc2 Three months later, Williams' car broke down and he parked in a cemetery parking lot. He had just moved to the area to be near his mother and had been facing jail in Tennessee for failing to pay child support.\par \par \uc2 Calkins came upon him and called for a tow. He then detained Williams for also failing to provide identification. He was recorded using a Southern black accent as he spoke to his dispatcher and described Williams' car as a "homie Cadillac."\par \par \uc2 Neither man was ever seen again.\par \par \uc2 Calkins told investigators he had released the men before taking them to jail because they had been nice and he cut them a break. The Collier sheriff's office says Calkins failed a polygraph examination, but investigators found no blood or signs of struggle in his patrol car. A tracking device was placed on it in case he ever visited a spot where the bodies may have been dumped. He never did.\par \par \uc2 The sheriff's office said in an email Tuesday it is still investigating the case and that it is unusual; no other men went missing during that time period. Calkins remains a person of interest in the disappearance of Williams and Santos, the email said.\par \par \uc2 If questioned by Crump as part of the lawsuit, Calkins could invoke his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, but the bar to succeed in a civil case is lower than a criminal case. In the lawsuit, Crump would have to show it is more likely than not that Calkins killed Williams. In a criminal case, prosecutors would have to prove that beyond a reasonable doubt, a tough standard without any bodies.\par \par \uc2 Crump praised the Collier investigators, saying they and prosecutors have they done what they could but now it is time to help them get some answers.\par \par \uc2 "Terrance Williams is going to be the beacon of hope for what people can do," said Crump, who gained national fame representing the family of Trayvon Martin, the 17-year-old Florida youth fatally shot by George Zimmerman in 2012.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 Foley reported from Cedar Rapids, Iowa.\par \par \uc2 Filmmaker Tyler Perry, center, speaks to a a press conference announcing a lawsuit against former Collier County Sheriff's Deputy Steven Calkins, Monday, Sept. 4, 2018 in Naples, Fla.

John McCain\uc2  during his speech at a Republican party dinner in Ohio Friday, hours after the family of the ailing senator said he had chosen to discontinue medical treatment for brain cancer.\par \par \uc2 The White House didn't address McCain's announcement and the president didn't make any references to the senator. Trump has frequently criticized McCain for voting against a 2017 plan in the Senate to replace the so-called "Obamacare" law.\par \par \uc2 The two Republican leaders have had a strained relationship dating back to 2015, when Trump suggested the Vietnam veteran and prisoner of war was not a war hero.\par \par \uc2 McCain has been critical of Trump even while undergoing medical treatment in Arizona, slamming Trump's summit with Russian President \uc2 Vladimir Putin\uc2  as a "tragic mistake."\par \par \uc2 __\par \par \uc2 7 p.m.\par \par \uc2 President \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  is branding Democrats as "left-wing haters and radicals" who are trying to "tear down our institutions."\par \par \uc2 He also says they're "nasty."\par \par \uc2 Trump unleashed the string of insults in a speech Friday at the Ohio Republican Party fundraising dinner in Columbus. The speech was meant to help unite fractious state Republicans heading into the November midterm elections.\par \par \uc2 Trump says that with Democrats, "it's always negative, nasty, the way they come after me."\par \par \uc2 Polls show that large majorities of Democrats disapprove of Trump's performance in office, but he says they need to get over it and accept that he's president.\par \par \uc2 Adds Trump: "We won the election. We're going to win again in 2020. ... These are nasty people."\par \par \uc2 __\par \par \uc2 6:40 p.m.\par \par \uc2 President \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  is talking about the Iowa college student was found slain about a month after she disappeared.\par \par \uc2 Trump raised the case in a speech Friday at an Ohio Republican dinner. The family of 20-year-old Mollie Tibbetts has asked that her death not be politicized.\par \par \uc2 Authorities have charged Cristhian Bahena Rivera, a Mexico native suspected of being in the U.S. illegally, with first-degree murder in Tibbetts' death.\par \par \uc2 Trump raised Tibbetts' case as justification for his attempts to crack down on illegal immigration to the U.S.\par \par \uc2 He refers to Rivera as "this horrible \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 " and claims erroneously that journalists didn't want to cover the story after questions were raised about Rivera's status.\par \par \uc2 Trump says "what happened to Mollie is a disgrace."\par \par \uc2 __\par \par \uc2 6:05 p.m.\par \par \uc2 President \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  is predicting victory in November as he opens a keynote speech at a fundraising dinner for Ohio Republicans.\par \par \uc2 Trump is trying to help unite a fractious state GOP with Friday's speech in Columbus. But the annual event is being skipped by Ohio's Republican governor, John Kasich. Kasich challenged Trump for the GOP presidential nomination in 2016 and remains one of Trump's sharpest critics.\par \par \uc2 Trump says: "This November, we're going to win really big. It's going to be one big Ohio family."\par \par \uc2 He is stressing the importance of electing more Ohio Republicans in November to help the party keep its hold on both houses of Congress.\par \par \uc2 __\par \par \uc2 5:40 p.m.\par \par \uc2 President \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  will seek to unite a fractious state Republican Party in Ohio on Friday in an address to GOP loyalists at a dinner that was being skipped by Gov. John Kasich, one of the president's 2016 primary opponents and sharpest critics.\par \par \uc2 Trump's appearance at the annual fundraiser sought to project an image of common purpose in the nation's premier battleground state despite deep internal divisions. Ohio holds a number of high-stakes races for governor, Senate and several U.S. House seats that could factor into GOP control of Congress this fall \u8212\'20\'14 and importantly for Trump, linger into the next presidential campaign.\par \par \uc2 President Donald Trump arrives to speak at the Ohio Republican Party State Dinner, Friday, Aug. 24, 2018, in Columbus, Ohio.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 A roundup of some of the most popular but completely untrue headlines of the week. None of these stories is legit, even though they were shared widely on social media. The Associated Press checked these out. Here are the real facts:\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 NOT REAL: We Now Know Why Valerie Jarrett Moved In With The Obama's (sic) In DC\par \par \uc2 THE FACTS: Former President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 's senior adviser, Valerie Jarrett, has not moved into his home as claimed in a story circulating online. Great American Republic, a website that describes itself as a news curator, published the claim July 1 as part of a story suggesting that Obama is "helping lead the anti-Trump resistance from his DC compound." The report did not provide any details or a source for the information. Obama's personal office denied that Jarrett has moved in with him and his wife Michelle. Jarrett could not be reached for comment. It is not the first time the claim has been made. The Daily Mail, a British tabloid, falsely reported in 2017 that Jarrett had moved into the Obama's Washington home to help "mastermind the insurgency against President Trump." Great American Republic did not respond to requests for comment.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 NOT REAL: WATERS: SCOTUS PICK SHOULD BE \uc2 ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT\par \par \uc2 THE FACTS: California Rep. Maxine Waters did not appear on \uc2 CNN\uc2  calling for the next \uc2 U.S. Supreme Court\uc2  pick to be an "\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 " despite a false image circulating online. The altered image was posted on the Trump Nation Facebook page June 28. It shows Waters during a \uc2 CNN\uc2  interview, over a banner that reads, "WATERS: SCOTUS PICK SHOULD BE \uc2 ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT\uc2 ." The ticker below the breaking news banner says: "IT'S THE ONLY WAY THE DEMOCRATS CAN EVER WIN AGAIN." The screenshot appears to be taken from her October 24, 2017, appearance on the program "New Day." In both the 2017 interview and the image on the Trump Nation Facebook page, Waters is wearing the same clothes and jewelry and appears with the same background. Waters' office said in an email the quote was an "absolute lie," adding she never discussed immigrants and the Supreme Court on \uc2 CNN\uc2 . Trump Nation did not respond to requests for comment by phone and Facebook Messenger.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 NOT REAL: Disneyland providing 5 free tickets per family to celebrate its 110th year of quality service!\par \par \uc2 THE FACTS: Disneyland is not giving away free tickets to 500 families to celebrate 110 years of service, despite an advertisement circulating on social media. The false offer looks like a coupon. It features artwork of Cinderella's castle with Disneyland Resorts written to appear like the theme park's trademark. It offers 5 free tickets. When users click on the offer it says, "Congratulations! You have been selected to take part in our short survey to get 2 Free Disneyland Tickets." Users are then asked three questions and told they have won the tickets. At the end of the questions it asks the participant to share and "like" the message. Melissa Britt, a Disneyland Resort spokeswoman, told The Associated Press in an email that the offer is false and that Disneyland does not have any special promotions at the moment. Disneyland opened July 17, 1955, which was 62 years ago, not 110.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 This is part of The Associated Press' ongoing effort to fact-check misinformation that is shared widely online, including work with \uc2 Facebook\uc2  to identify and reduce the circulation of false stories on the platform.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 Find all AP Fact Checks here: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.apnews.com/tag/APFactCheck"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://www.apnews.com/tag/APFactCheck}}}\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 Follow @APFactCheck on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 : {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://twitter.com/APFactCheck"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://twitter.com/APFactCheck}}}\par \par \uc2 FILE - In this Aug. 4, 2014 file photo, then White House Senior Adviser Valerie Jarrett speaks in Washington during the Investing in Women, Peace and Prosperity luncheon of the 2014 US Africa Summit.

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc44}{\*\bkmkend toc44}\b \uc2 Recent editorials from Texas newspapers\b0\par\par\uc2 By The Associated Press \par \uc2 3,073 \uc2 words\par \uc2 3 July 2018\par 12:43\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2018.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Here are excerpts from recent editorials in Texas newspapers:\par \par \uc2 Houston Chronicle. July 1, 2018.\par \par \uc2 Over the course of \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 's presidential campaign, a strange ritual developed at his rallies, one that still takes place today. Occasionally, a person or a group of people would wander from the crowd to the media section in the middle of the room and just start yelling. Not about anything particular, usually \u8212\'20\'14 just as an expression of raw anger and frustration at the people who conservatives have long called the "lamestream media," the president now calls "the enemy of the American people," and the far-right, borrowing a cheerful term from pre-war Germany, calls the "L\u252\'00\'FCgenpresse," or lying press.\par \par \uc2 Demeaning the messenger when the message isn't to your liking is very effective, which is why politicians have been doing it just about everywhere as long as there's been a press. But the conviction of many that members of the media are less than people has intensified lately, encouraged by the people at the top. And that's a frightening thing.\par \par \uc2 The only person directly to blame for the recent shooting at the headquarters of the Capital Gazette newspaper in Maryland that killed five people is the shooter, Jarrod Ramos. Ramos seems to have been mentally unwell, and he had a personal grudge against the newspaper for reporting his systemic harassment, some years ago, of a young woman in town. Ramos had previously sued the paper for defamation. His case was thrown out of court.\par \par \uc2 But the shooting is a painful reminder of what it is journalists do, by and large, and how widely the burgeoning national narrative about them has missed the mark. The vast majority of them will never appear on cable news, and will never write an article about the president. They are, simply, people who have dedicated themselves to telling the stories of other people. The stories told by the people who were killed this week included the tales of local high school sports teams and the goings-on at city council.\par \par \uc2 "They don't make a lot of money \u8212\'20\'14 maybe $30,000 a year," Annapolis Mayor Gavin Buckley said. "It's immoral that their lives were at risk."\par \par \uc2 Good information about the world is the very smallest building block of a civil society \u8212\'20\'14 and democracy, too. Journalists are the factory workers who produce it. In some places, that can be very dangerous. Scores of journalists have been killed in recent years in Mexico \u8212\'20\'14 six in 2017 \u8212\'20\'14 doing hard work to expose political corruption and cartel violence, and others die or are injured regularly in conflict zones around the world.\par \par \uc2 But even where it is "safe" to be a journalist, it is not a good time to be one. The industry is eroding, and job security is in very short supply. Low salaries make it difficult to build a life, long hours make it difficult to grow a family, and high stress makes it difficult to maintain mental health. The internet has made it possible for the public to subject journalists \u8212\'20\'14 particularly female journalists and journalists of color \u8212\'20\'14 to a stupefying stream of degrading invective and abuse. A job-hunting service last year ranked broadcast media and newspaper journalism as the two worst jobs in America. Most people who do it continue to do it because they think of it as a public service performed at personal cost, and weeks like this one can make that hard to justify.\par \par \uc2 Journalists are adversarial: That's the job, and the people who do it are used to being disliked. As the saying goes, everything else is public relations. What's harmful, and new, is the feeling of many that the media as a class are bad for society \u8212\'20\'14 "the enemy of the people," as the president said in South Carolina, three days before the shooting, as he had done several times before.\par \par \uc2 We can hope that the president tones down that rhetoric in the future, and that other powerful people in society stop using the press as a punching bag, but old habits die hard. What can you do? Well, if you know somebody who works at a newspaper, buy them a drink. If you don't, subscribe to one. A small one, like the Capital Gazette \u8212\'20\'14 in the town you grow up in or the beach town you're visiting this summer. There are people like Gerald Fischman and Rob Hiaasen and Wendy Winters and John McNamara and Rebecca Smith all over the country, doing hard work at a time when what money there remains in journalism is flowing to the big cities. The best way to honor their memory is to support their colleagues.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 The Eagle. July 1, 2018.\par \par \uc2 It came as no real surprise when Supreme Court Justice \uc2 Anthony Kennedy\uc2  announced he will step down July 31, after 30 years on the high court.\par \par \uc2 Barely had the announcement been made when the Democrats and the Republicans were at each other's throat.\par \par \uc2 Liberals had hoped that Kennedy, 81, would hold on a bit longer, at least until after the November elections, in which they hope to recapture control of the Senate \u8212\'20\'14 which has to approve any Supreme Court nomination \u8212\'20\'14 and, possibly, the House. Kennedy often has been the swing vote on the divided court, particularly after the retirement of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. It was Kennedy who cast the tie-breaking vote allowing same-sex marriage. His final vote, however, was to uphold President \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 's travel ban on people from several mostly-Muslim countries in the Middle East, as well as North Korea and Venezuela.\par \par \uc2 Republicans want to be sure they have a new Supreme Court justice in place before the Nov. 6 elections, although they say they are confident they will prevail at the polls.\par \par \uc2 For their part, Democrats are determined to stall the nomination.\par \par \uc2 Why? Whenever the vote is taken, it is President \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 's appointment to make. And if his first nomination fails, he will name someone similar to the post. And if that fails ... .\par \par \uc2 That's the way it works.\par \par \uc2 When \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  was president, he made three appointments to the court, two of whom now sit on the august body: \uc2 Sonia Sotomayor\uc2  and \uc2 Elena Kagan\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The third appointment, \uc2 Merrick Garland\uc2 , will be the big bone of contention in the upcoming debate on President Trump's nominee, whomever that is.\par \par \uc2 When Justice Antonin Scalia died on Feb. 13, 2016, Obama nominated Garland, who was the respected chief judge of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. Even though some of them actually approved of Garland personally, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell refused to schedule any hearings on Garland's nomination, saying tradition said presidents in the final year of their term don't get to replace Supreme Court justices when they die or resign.\par \par \uc2 Of course, that isn't true. Justice Kennedy was appointed by President \uc2 Ronald Reagan\uc2  in the final years of that president's eight-year term.\par \par \uc2 So Republicans should have at least considered Garland's nomination, but they didn't. That, as they say, is water under the bridge. Democrats, however, will use the argument that, since this is an election year, Trump shouldn't be allowed to make an appointment until after the voting.\par \par \uc2 But there is a big difference. \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  still will be president for the next two and one-half years. Whether he makes the appointment now or early next year, he still is president. He still gets to name people to the high court, subject to Senate approval.\par \par \uc2 And be assured, President Trump will appoint a strong conservative to the court. Though we doubt most voters choose a candidate simply because of who he or she might appoint to the Supreme Court, that is always in the back of their mind. We understand that when we elect a Democrat, nominees are more likely to be to the left politically, and when we elect a Republican, nominees will be more conservative.\par \par \uc2 While \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  isn't a traditional Republican, we all understand his nominees will lean to the right.\par \par \uc2 In an effort to get his nomination approved before November, President Trump says he will name Kennedy's replacement on July 9. He already has several candidates under consideration. We hope whomever he picks is well-qualified and doesn't come to the court with a political agenda. We would wish the same for all future candidates, no matter who is making the nomination.\par \par \uc2 The Supreme Court is not the place to play politics.\par \par \uc2 We await the president's nomination with eagerness and interest.\par \par \uc2 Once he or she is named, we urge Democrats to give the nominee a fair and speedy hearing. Don't say no because of what has happened in the past or because the nomination was made by a president they don't like.\par \par \uc2 At some point, we have got to stop the gotcha politics that have gridlocked our Congress,\par \par \uc2 Let that time be now.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 The Dallas Morning News. July 2, 2018.\par \par \uc2 Last week, it was a newsroom in Annapolis, Maryland. About a month ago, it was Santa Fe High School in Texas. And in February, it was a high school in Parkland, Florida. Regardless of our politics, there couldn't be any stronger warning sign that something is going wrong in our country than the prevalence of mass shootings.\par \par \uc2 So we were more than a little encouraged recently when folks from the Texas-based \uc2 Laura and John Arnold Foundation\uc2  stopped by our offices to talk about an initiative they've launched to do something about this problem.\par \par \uc2 There are a lot of people who call for something to be done, but what stands out about the Arnold Foundation's work is that it attempts to bridge the political divide that stymies discussion. The foundation focuses on taking the first crucial step of gathering information before offering policy prescriptions.\par \par \uc2 Here is what the Arnold Foundation is doing: Over the next five years, it has pledged to spend $20 million on research into gun violence, and efforts to encourage others to engage in such research. In the short run, the foundation hopes to raise an additional $30 million in private funds. And the foundation is also collaborating with the \uc2 Rand Corp\uc2 . to collect and analyze empirical evidence needed to ascertain what could make a meaningful difference.\par \par \uc2 In the long run, the foundation's goal is more ambitious. It hopes to spark a massive \u8212\'20\'14 private and government \u8212\'20\'14 research effort. The ultimate aim, of course, is to draw the federal government into the research effort. That would provide substantial dollars as well as pull in talented researchers from across the country.\par \par \uc2 If this sounds like so many previous efforts, it's not. In this case, the Arnold Foundation is reaching out to organizations that support gun rights \u8212\'20\'14 including the \uc2 National Rifle Association\uc2  \u8212\'20\'14 and is starting from the premise that the Second Amendment protects gun ownership in America. Those working on this initiative hope that the Heller decision, in which the \uc2 U.S. Supreme Court\uc2  upheld the individual right to own guns, can be used to change the national narrative so gun enthusiasts can feel empowered to work with others to find new ways to reduce gun violence.\par \par \uc2 Even though the intention of this initiative is to find ideas that can reduce violence \u8212\'20\'14 not simply offer a litany of the same old gun-control proposals \u8212\'20\'14 we recognize that this will be a heavy lift. There is substantial opposition to using federal dollars for such research out of fear that it would be used to advocate for a one-sided political agenda.\par \par \uc2 There may be no way to allay such fears, other than to conduct research that demonstrates there are many ways to save lives without violating individual rights. And to that end, we're encouraged to see the Arnold Foundation's efforts and look forward to seeing the fruits of this initiative.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 San Antonio Express-News. July 2, 2018.\par \par \uc2 Residents of Texas Senate District 19 deserved better.\par \par \uc2 Last week, former state Sen. Carlos Uresti, D-San Antonio, joined the ranks of a growing list of South Texas elected officials sentenced to prison.\par \par \uc2 Uresti was sentenced June 26 to 12 years in federal prison on fraud charges in connection with the operations of the now-defunct FourWinds Logistics, a company that specialized in sand used in oil production. He was also ordered to pay $6.3 million in restitution.\par \par \uc2 His lawyers, friends, family and associates urged leniency in sentencing by Senior U.S. District Judge David Ezra. In their pleas in court and more than 50 letters penned to the judge, Uresti's supporters cited the former senator's years of public service. They noted the good work he had done as a state lawmaker on behalf of abused children, veterans and others.\par \par \uc2 We applauded his many accomplishments representing his district. But that record is one of the reasons the 12-year sentence is merited.\par \par \uc2 Uresti used that record, the prestige of his office derived from that record and the power of his Senate seat to rope investors into a Ponzi scheme. He banked on the trust and respect garnered from his service in the Texas Legislature to make targets feel secure about their investments.\par \par \uc2 Among the dozens of letters submitted in support of leniency for the former state senator was one from Bexar County District Attorney Nico LaHood.\par \par \uc2 LaHood's involvement in the sentencing phase of this case is wrong on many levels.\par \par \uc2 Although he was defeated in his bid for re-election, LaHood is still the county's top elected law enforcement officer in our community. He has no business advocating for someone who has been convicted by a jury.\par \par \uc2 Lahood was co-owner of a company that did business with FourWinds. He never disclosed that relationship when an investor tried to get him to investigate FourWinds for possible wrongdoing. That investor eventually went to the \uc2 FBI\uc2 , which launched the investigation that brought down Uresti.\par \par \uc2 In the more than a year since formal charges were brought against Uresti, constituents in his district have been without effective representation. While an indictment is not a pronouncement of guilt and there are no state laws requiring elected officials to give up their post when facing criminal charges, they should.\par \par \uc2 Multicount indictments, especially when they could result in the loss of liberty and livelihood as they did in Uresti's case, can be distracting, to say the least. Just how effective can someone facing criminal charges be among his colleagues?\par \par \uc2 But it took Uresti four months after his conviction to resign his seat. And this apparently occurred to meet a milestone anniversary in his career in elected office. He gave up his State Bar license rather than face disbarment proceedings, but his constituents had no such recourse to get effective representation.\par \par \uc2 Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick stripped Uresti of his committee assignments, and his colleagues in the Legislature urged his resignation after his conviction in February. Still Uresti held on until he had achieved his 22nd anniversary as a state elected official.\par \par \uc2 This last self-serving act delayed the call of special election to fill his unexpired term and left the 800,000 residents of District 19 without a voice for too long.\par \par \uc2 An ironic upside of all this is that the delay bolstered his state official pension, which might come in handy for making restitution.\par \par \uc2 Uresti, 54, is eligible to immediately begin collecting an estimated $80,000 a year pension for his years in the Legislature.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 Amarillo Globe-News. July 3, 2018.\par \par \uc2 A column by syndicated columnists \uc2 Cokie Roberts\uc2  and Steve Roberts clings to the same tired argument of those who favor open borders \u8212\'20\'14 mainly the belief that crimes committed by illegal immigrants are not enough of a concern to support reasonable immigration laws.\par \par \uc2 This is from the lead of the aforementioned column (which appeared in the Amarillo Globe-News), "One of President Trump's most persistent and pernicious lies is that immigrants cause an increase in crime. That's not true."\par \par \uc2 Note the word "\uc2 illegal" immigrant\uc2  is not used in the column's lead \u8212\'20\'14 as if this term does not matter. It does matter.\par \par \uc2 Let us address the premise of the column \u8212\'20\'14 that (illegal) immigrants do not cause an increase in crime rates.\par \par \uc2 Logically, this claim makes no sense. If an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  commits a crime (and illegal immigrants are what we are talking about here), then there is an increase in the crime rate, because this individual broke the law by crossing the U.S. border illegally. And any additional crime for which this individual is responsible does represent an increase in the crime rate, since this individual should not have been in the country in the first place. Therefore, the rate of crime does increase, because there would not have been a crime committed had this person not been in the country.\par \par \uc2 Make sense?\par \par \uc2 Then there is this \u8212\'20\'14 comparing the crime rate of illegal immigrants to U.S. citizens is pointless and irresponsible.\par \par \uc2 According to numbers from the \uc2 U.S. Department of Homeland Security\uc2 , in 2016 a total of 58 percent of all removals of "aliens" by \uc2 U.S. Immigration and Custom Enforcement (ICE) \uc2 officials had been previously convicted of a crime. There were 2,057 "aliens" classified as being suspected or confirmed gang members.\par \par \uc2 And the most disturbing number (again from the USDHS), an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  with a prior criminal conviction was charged with murder every 12 days from 2010 to 2014.\par \par \uc2 And these numbers did not come from the Trump administration. They came from the Obama administration.\par \par \uc2 It is not really relevant whether illegal immigrants commit more crimes than U.S. citizens. And we doubt whether the victims of crimes committed by illegal immigrants care about such comparisons.\par \par \uc2 And let us be clear \u8212\'20\'14 there is a significant number of illegal immigrants who do not commit crimes \u8212\'20\'14 other than illegally crossing the U.S. border, that is. These illegal immigrants are not necessarily the problem.\par \par \uc2 The problem is if the \uc2 U.S. government\uc2  does not provide a legal, safe and transparent way to determine who is coming into the country, then possibility exists that some individuals will commit crimes. And for those who happen to be the victims of these crimes, one crime is enough.\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020180703ee7300go8\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Wisconsin State Journal, June 27\par \par \uc2 Good news for Main Street businesses\par \par \uc2 Of course Wisconsin should require the same sales tax on purchases made over the internet that state lawmakers already require at Main Street stores.\par \par \uc2 That's only fair.\par \par \uc2 And the good news is the \uc2 U.S. Supreme Court\uc2  agrees. The high court last week ruled states can tax online sales from sellers in other states, expanding a decision from 1992.\par \par \uc2 This should allow Wisconsin to collect more than $100 million in sales taxes on digital purchases that have been dodging this basic fee for years.\par \par \uc2 We don't blame state residents for going online to find the best price for a product. But a significant reason many online products are less expensive is because state sales tax doesn't apply.\par \par \uc2 That needs to change. And Gov. Scott Walker and other state leaders this week seemed to agree that it will.\par \par \uc2 Good.\par \par \uc2 We're also happy the governor and lawmakers aren't rushing back to the state Capitol in Madison to spend tens of millions of dollars in anticipated revenue before it arrives.\par \par \uc2 The state stands to gain as much as $187 million in annual revenue by charging an online sales tax.\par \par \uc2 Republicans, predictably, want to return any extra revenue from broader sales tax collections to residents in the form of an income tax credit or lower rate.\par \par \uc2 Democrats, predictably, want to steer the money to areas of need, such as roads, public education or high-speed internet.\par \par \uc2 That's premature. State leaders should \u8212\'20\'14 and apparently will \u8212\'20\'14 wait until next year to make a decision. By then, state officials and the public should have a better idea of how the state's finances are shaping up. Will the state have more revenue than expected, thanks to a strong economy? Or will trade wars and other factors dampen growth, creating a budget hole that needs filling just to continue spending priorities at current levels.\par \par \uc2 Any decision should be well informed and not rushed for electoral advantage this fall.\par \par \uc2 Some conservatives have long opposed any new tax on internet sales, claiming it's a tax increase. In reality, a fair sales tax applied to all purchases \u8212\'20\'14 though not essentials, such as food \u8212\'20\'14 allows for a free market without local stores being disadvantaged by government.\par \par \uc2 Some liberals complain that a broader sales tax will be regressive, applying the same 5 percent rate (plus a 0.5 percent fee in Dane and most counties) to the rich and the poor. But this ignores that people with more disposable income tend to shop and spend more online because they have better access to digital technology.\par \par \uc2 The most pressing concern should be the fate of local business people in brick-and-mortar stores across Wisconsin who employ local people, pay local property taxes and often serve as community boosters. They deserve a fair shake from state government when selling furniture, televisions or other products. They shouldn't be stuck with a government fee that their competition gets to avoid.\par \par \uc2 State leaders should apply the same sales tax uniformly and then assess what to do with any revenue next year.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 The Capital Times, June 27\par \par \uc2 Scott Walker is lying to Wisconsinites about gerrymandering\par \par \uc2 When the \uc2 U.S. Supreme Court\uc2  decided to send the challenge that Wisconsinites have mounted to gerrymandering back to the district court for further consideration, the fight for fair lines and real competition in our elections returned to the political arena.\par \par \uc2 The courts may yet find a way to prevent politicians from gaming the system in their favor \u8212\'20\'14 and against the interests of the electorate \u8212\'20\'14 but for now the best prospect for reform rests with candidates for governor and the Legislature.\par \par \uc2 Elect the right candidates and the change can be made \u8212\'20\'14 no matter what the courts do.\par \par \uc2 Elect the wrong candidates and we will be stuck with gerrymandered lines that prevent government from reflecting the will of the people.\par \par \uc2 That is the stark choice that Wisconsinites face, as Gov. Scott Walker made clear following the court's decision.\par \par \uc2 Walker's power extends from gerrymandering, which has given his Republican allies control of the state Assembly and state Senate. The governor is so committed to keeping the corrupted lines that he lied \u8212\'20\'14 about the court's decision.\par \par \uc2 Walker said: "I think the lines are fair when we signed them, and the bottom line in this is that the \uc2 United States Supreme Court\uc2 , on a unanimous decision, decided the state of Wisconsin was right in its case."\par \par \uc2 In fact, the justices have sent the case back for further consideration by the lower court that has already determined the lines are unfair. Because members of the high court had doubts about whether the specific plaintiffs in this case had standing to challenge the lines, new rounds of legal wrangling will now begin.\par \par \uc2 To be sure, the delay is frustrating for reformers. The decision, explained The \uc2 New York Times\uc2 , was "a setback for critics of partisan gerrymandering, who had hoped that the Supreme Court would decide the cases on their merits and rule in their favor, transforming American democracy by subjecting to close judicial scrutiny oddly shaped districts that amplify one party's political power."\par \par \uc2 That does not mean, as Walker seemed to suggest, that the fight against partisan gerrymandering is finished. The court invited additional litigation. Bill Whitford, the retired University of Wisconsin law professor who was the named plaintiff in the Wisconsin case, said, "We are confident we can prove the real harms to real citizens caused by lawmakers who choose their voters instead of the voters choosing their representatives."\par \par \uc2 Paul Smith\uc2 , the vice president of litigation and strategy at the \uc2 Campaign Legal Center\uc2 , who argued Whitford's case before the court in October 2017, said: "This case is very much still alive. We now have the opportunity to demonstrate the real and concrete harms that result from partisan gerrymandering in the lower court, the same court that struck down the Wisconsin mapping scheme to begin with."\par \par \uc2 Why would Walker lie about the Supreme Court decision?\par \par \uc2 Because he needs gerrymandering to be able to continue to enact laws that are not popular with the people but that satisfy his campaign donors. As such, he wants the debate about gerrymandering to go away.\par \par \uc2 But it is not going away.\par \par \uc2 If Walker is beaten this year, Wisconsin will not have to wait for the courts to sort things out. We can end gerrymandering.\par \par \uc2 All of the serious contenders for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination have sent more honest signals than the incumbent. But some were clearer than others.\par \par \uc2 The most impressive response to the Supreme Court ruling came from former state Rep. Kelda Helen Roys, who said, "As governor, I will veto any maps that give one party an unfair advantage, and will work to restore voting rights and ethics in government, so that Wisconsinites can have faith that our elected representatives serve our needs rather than their own."\par \par \uc2 That's the gold-standard response.\par \par \uc2 Roys outlined a strong and specific position. People know what she is for \u8212\'20\'14 and what she is against.\par \par \uc2 Voters should look for a similar level of clarity in the statements from legislative candidates. If candidates for the Assembly and Senate fail to express a clear commitment to fair lines and honest elections, don't vote for them. If candidates put themselves on the side of reform \u8212\'20\'14 aggressively and unequivocally \u8212\'20\'14 they are worthy of consideration.\par \par \uc2 A commitment to end gerrymandering is not all that voters should seek from candidates. Real reformers must also advocate for campaign-finance reform, removal of the barriers to voting that Walker and his allies have erected, and a renewal of the state's commitment to high-turnout elections that put power in the hands of the voters rather than the politicians.\par \par \uc2 But if a candidate cannot provide clarity on the issue of gerrymandering, he or she should not be in the Legislature \u8212\'20\'14 or the governor's mansion.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 The Journal Times of Racine, June 27\par \par \uc2 Due-process rights for all or for none\par \par \uc2 President \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 's hard-line stance on immigration took an unconstitutional turn on Sunday.\par \par \uc2 "We cannot allow all of these people to invade our Country," Trump wrote that day on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 . "When somebody comes in, we must immediately, with no Judges or Court Cases, bring them back from where they came."\par \par \uc2 Such a policy would be an elimination of due process, which is guaranteed under the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution; and then the Sixth Amendment, which says: "In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial."\par \par \uc2 If you find yourself thinking "but illegal immigrants aren't U.S. citizens," know that the Supreme Court has ruled in a series of cases that if a person is within the United States, he or she has rights under the Constitution, including the right to due process; that a person deemed to be an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , accused of a violation of U.S. law, has rights under that same law. In its decision in Zadyvdas vs. Davis in 2001, the majority wrote that "once an alien enters the country, the legal circumstance changes, for the due process clause applies to all persons (not just citizens) within the United States."\par \par \uc2 That may anger you, that a person crossing the border illegally has automatically obtained the right to due process. But if that's how you feel, you're missing the point.\par \par \uc2 Were those accused of illegal immigration to be denied due process, what's to stop the government declaring that any of us are here illegally?\par \par \uc2 What's that? You say you're a citizen, and you have proof?\par \par \uc2 Too bad. The government says you're not, and is denying you the opportunity to challenge its claim in court.\par \par \uc2 Good look in indefinite detention, or wherever the government is dumping you.\par \par \uc2 The Fifth Amendment guarantee of due process protects all of us, or none of us.\par \par \uc2 As we are inclined to do in this space from time to time: Imagine a president you didn't vote for being given the power to end due process.\par \par \uc2 Yes, a nation can deny entry, as the Supreme Court ruled Tuesday on the president's travel ban. But in this nation, if you're here, you get due process.\par \par \uc2 Those who note that Central American migrants aren't seeking asylum in Mexico, but instead are traveling through Mexico to seek it here in the United States, have a valid point. As do those who seek proof from everyone claiming a need for political asylum, and those who seek a more streamlined process, in line with the Sixth Amendment, for resolving the legal status of undocumented immigrants. It's not wrong to want secure borders.\par \par \uc2 But it is wrong to suggest that those of suspected of being illegal immigrants should be denied due process.\par \par \uc2 Without due process, the government has all the power and the individual, citizen or otherwise, has none.\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020180702ee72009t1\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 DALLAS (AP) \u8212\'20\'14 \uc2 American Airlines\uc2  and \uc2 United Airlines\uc2  said Wednesday that they asked the Trump administration not to use their flights to carry migrant children who were separated from their parents by immigration authorities.\par \par \uc2 Facing growing opposition to his administration's recent policy of separating migrant families, President \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  signed an order later in the day to keep families together at the nation's southern border.\par \par \uc2 The issue had galvanized flight attendants, some of whom took to social media to post young children on flights whom they believed to be migrants separated from their parents.\par \par \uc2 "We have no desire to be associated with separating families, or worse, to profit from it," American said in a statement.\par \par \uc2 United then issued a statement in which CEO \uc2 Oscar Munoz\uc2  said the company's purpose is to connect people. "This policy and its impact on thousands of children is in deep conflict with that mission and we want no part of it," he said.\par \par \uc2 Southwest, Frontier and Alaska also criticized the policy and asked not to be involved in transporting separated children.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 A spokesman for the Homeland Security Department criticized the airlines in strong terms, accusing them of no longer wanting to help the agency protect the traveling public and reunite unaccompanied \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  children with their families.\par \par \uc2 "Despite being provided facts on this issue, these airlines clearly do not understand our immigration laws," the spokesman, Tyler Houlton, said in a statement. He accused the airlines of "buckling to a false media narrative."\par \par \uc2 Things shifted again when Trump signed an executive order to keep families together at the southern border, saying at the White House that he doesn't like the sight of children being separated from their families. But he added that the "zero tolerance" policy will continue.\par \par \uc2 Delta Air Lines\uc2 , which had been notably silent most of the day, then issued a brief statement calling reports of families being separated "disheartening," and praising Trump's executive order.\par \par \uc2 The White House announced its zero-tolerance policy toward undocumented migrants in early May. Since then, more than 2,300 children have been taken from their parents at the southwestern border, leading to a spike in the number of young children under government care. However, most of the unaccompanied minors in the custody of U.S. authorities arrived at the border without their parents.\par \par \uc2 Both American and United said they do not know whether any migrant children separated from their parents have been placed on their flights. In recent days several flight attendants have gone on social media to report seeing groups of children on their flights whom they believed to be children separated from their migrant families.\par \par \uc2 "These flight attendants were well aware of what was going on, so how can these airlines claim they didn't know? I don't believe that," said \uc2 Michael Avenatti\uc2 , a lawyer better known for representing a porn actress in a legal fight against Trump, but who said he also represents more than 50 migrant families who have been separated from their children.\par \par \uc2 Many airlines have contracts to provide travel services to the \uc2 U.S. government\uc2 . American said, however, that the government doesn't provide information about the passengers or their reason for travel.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 This story has been corrected to show that \uc2 American Airlines\uc2  issued a statement, not CEO \uc2 Doug Parker\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 David Koenig can be reached at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://twitter.com/airlinewriter"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://twitter.com/airlinewriter}}}\par \par \uc2 In this June 16, 2018 photo, American Airlines aircrafts are seen at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport in Grapevine, Texas.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) \u8212\'20\'14 Outside money is pouring into Montana's \uc2 U.S. Senate\uc2  race even before Republicans settle on a nominee to challenge Democratic Sen. Jon Tester, who has become a leading target of the GOP after drawing the fury of President \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  .\par \par \uc2 Four Republicans are jockeying for a last-minute advantage ahead of the June 5 primary.\par \par \uc2 Their ambitions to topple the two-term incumbent were buoyed after Trump \u8212\'20\'14 who won in Montana by 20 percentage points \u8212\'20\'14 unloaded on Tester for releasing allegations that the president's pick for head of the \uc2 Department of Veterans Affairs\uc2  loosely handed out prescription drugs and got drunk on duty.\par \par \uc2 Among Tester's would-be challengers, state auditor \uc2 Matt Rosendale\uc2  has emerged as the favorite of deep-pocketed conservative donors. Outside groups including two bankrolled by Illinois billionaire Richard Uihlein have spent $1.8 million pumping Rosendale's candidacy. That's almost twice as much as he's raised himself.\par \par \uc2 It's opened Rosendale to attacks from his opponents who charge he's now beholden to special interests outside Montana.\par \par \uc2 Yet it also has allowed Rosendale, the only candidate to hold statewide office, to claim a mantle of legitimacy with major Republican donors. He said that's crucial if the GOP hopes to counter the huge amounts of campaign cash Tester has amassed ahead of November's general election.\par \par \uc2 "I have support not only from across the state. ... I also have national support and, guess what, that's critically important," Rosendale said. "They've recognized me as the best opportunity from the Republican Party to beat Jon Tester."\par \par \uc2 Retired state Judge Russ Fagg of Billings has sought to counter Rosendale's outside help with ads suggesting Rosendale, a Catholic who opposes the death penalty, would go easy on "\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  s who commit murder." Rosendale's backers at the conservative Club for Growth have responded by spending almost $900,000 through last week with ads pounding Fagg for allegedly favoring defendants over victims while on the bench.\par \par \uc2 Fagg, who's backed by several former governors and U.S. representatives from the state, sees himself as the only one with a chance to beat Rosendale \u8212\'20\'14 or Tester. He says his Montana roots defuse an issue already being exploited against Rosendale, a native of Baltimore who Democrats dubbed "Maryland Matt."\par \par \uc2 Fagg also says he's more willing than his opponents to part from Trump, in particular on possible trade tariffs he warns could draw a backlash against Montana's important agriculture industry.\par \par \uc2 "I'll disagree with this president when it's not in Montana's best interest," he said.\par \par \uc2 Kalispell state Sen. Al Olszewski has trailed the field in campaign cash. But he counts that as a point in his favor because it's made him the "grassroots, anti-establishment and commonsense candidate."\par \par \uc2 Olszewski described Rosendale as "bought and paid for" given the outside spending on his behalf. He said Fagg's willingness to run attack ads, criticized by some for perpetuating immigrant stereotypes, reflects poorly on the former judge.\par \par \uc2 "People are seeing negative commercials being run by two of the front-runners, and they're not happy with it," Olszewski said. "It's giving them a chance to say, 'Who else is in the race?'"\par \par \uc2 Big Sky businessman Troy Downing, a political newcomer, has tried to stay above the fray by largely refraining from criticism of his primary opponents and limiting his takedowns to Tester. He's spent at least $1 million of his own money promoting himself as the most Trump-like of the four \u8212\'20\'14 a successful businessman who's never served in public office.\par \par \uc2 Downing has been dogged by a pending criminal case against him: Montana game officials say he bought in-state hunting and fishing licenses during years he was living in California. Downing denies the charges and delayed his trial until after the primary.\par \par \uc2 Downing is an Afghanistan combat veteran, which he said gives him a close connection with a constituency that's long been courted by Tester, the ranking Democrat on the Veteran Affairs Committee.\par \par \uc2 After Trump's attempt to shame Tester over Veteran Affairs nominee Larry Jackson, two Democratic political action committee, or SuperPacs, spent more than $1 million in ads promoting Tester's record of support for veterans. Republican SuperPACs have spent $410,000 in recent months opposing Tester.\par \par \uc2 "No matter how he (Tester) is trying or not trying, it's not trickling down and actually improving the veteran experience in the state," Downing said.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 Follow Matthew Brown on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  at @matthewbrownap\par \par \uc2 FILE - This March 22, 2018 file photo shows candidates for the Republican nomination to U.S. Senate, from left, Russell Fagg, Troy Downing, Matt Rosendale and Albert Olszewski listen to a question posed by a moderator belonging to the College Republicans at Montana State University in Bozeman, Mont.

Trump says he'll keep using term for gang members\b0\par\par\uc2 By JILL COLVIN \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 861 \uc2 words\par \uc2 18 May 2018\par 09:02\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2018.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) \u8212\'20\'14 President \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  is defending his use of the word "animals" to describe some immigrants who enter the country illegally, saying he would continue to use the term to refer to violent gang members despite a sharp rebuke from Democratic leaders.\par \par \uc2 Answering a reporter's question during a meeting Thursday with NATO Secretary-General \uc2 Jens Stoltenberg\uc2 , Trump said his comment a day earlier had clearly been directed at members of the MS-13 gang.\par \par \uc2 "MS-13, these are animals coming onto our country," Trump said, repeating his language from Wednesday. "When the MS-13 comes in, when the other gang members come into our country, I refer to them as animals. And guess what? I always will."\par \par \uc2 Trump has been under fire for comments he made Wednesday while railing against California for its so-called sanctuary immigration policies. Trump was speaking at a roundtable with local California officials when he responded to a comment that had referenced MS-13.\par \par \uc2 "We have people coming into the country, or trying to come in \u8212\'20\'14 and we're stopping a lot of them," Trump said after Fresno County Sheriff Margaret Mims complained about state restrictions that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities. "You wouldn't believe how bad these people are. These aren't people. These are animals."\par \par \uc2 Trump has repeatedly referred to members of the violent street gang as "animals" in speeches, rallies and at White House events. He has also used the term to describe terrorists and school shooters.\par \par \uc2 Senate Minority Leader \uc2 Chuck Schumer\uc2 , D-N.Y., responded on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  to the president, saying, "When all of our great-great-grandparents came to America they weren't 'animals,' and these people aren't either."\par \par \uc2 And House Minority Leader \uc2 Nancy Pelosi\uc2 , D-Calif., said, "Every day that you think you've seen it all, along comes another manifestation of why their policies are so inhumane."\par \par \uc2 Homeland Security Secretary \uc2 Kirstjen Nielsen\uc2  said on Friday that lawmakers who criticized Trump for using the word owe the president an apology.\par \par \uc2 "Here you have elected members of Congress pretending that he's talking about something entirely different. It's dangerous, it's inappropriate and frankly, it's just unprofessional," Nielsen said on "\uc2 Fox\uc2  and Friends."\par \par \uc2 But White House press secretary \uc2 Sarah Huckabee Sanders\uc2  defended the president's comments, arguing the word "animals" didn't go far enough.\par \par \uc2 "This is one of the most vicious and deadly gangs that operates by the motto of, 'Rape, control and kill,'" she said. "If the media and liberals want to defend MS-13, they're more than welcome to. Frankly, I don't think the term that the president used was strong enough."\par \par \uc2 Trump was joined at Wednesday's White House meeting by mayors, sheriffs and other local leaders from California who oppose the state's immigration policies and who applauded his administration's hard-line efforts.\par \par \uc2 "This is your Republican resistance right here against what they're doing in California," said Assemblywoman Melissa Melendez, co-opting a term used by Democrats opposed to Trump's presidency. She, like others, said the president and his policies were far more popular in the state than people realize.\par \par \uc2 They were criticizing legislation signed into law last year by Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown that bars police from asking people about their immigration status or helping federal agents with immigration enforcement. Jail officials can transfer inmates to federal immigration authorities if they have been convicted of one of about 800 crimes, mostly felonies, but not for minor offenses.\par \par \uc2 Brown\uc2  insists the legislation, which took effect Jan. 1, doesn't prevent federal immigration officials from doing their jobs. But the Trump administration has sued to reverse it, calling the policies unconstitutional and dangerous. Some counties, including San Diego and Orange, have voted to support the lawsuit or have passed their own anti-sanctuary resolutions.\par \par \uc2 Republicans see backlash to the law as a potentially galvanizing issue during the midterm elections, especially with Trump's anti-immigrant base. And Trump has held numerous events in recent months during which he's drawn attention to California's policies.\par \par \uc2 During the session, Trump thanked the officials, saying they had "bravely resisted California's deadly and unconstitutional sanctuary state laws." He claimed those laws are forcing "the release of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  criminals, drug dealers, gang members and violent predators into your communities" and providing "safe harbor to some of the most vicious and violent offenders on earth."\par \par \uc2 Brown\uc2  responded on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , writing that Trump "is lying on immigration, lying about crime and lying about the laws of CA."\par \par \uc2 The governor added: "Flying in a dozen Republican politicians to flatter him and praise his reckless policies changes nothing. We, the citizens of the fifth largest economy in the world, are not impressed."\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writers Alan Fram in Washington, Kathleen Ronayne in Sacramento, California, and Elliot Spagat in San Diego contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 President Donald Trump speaks during a meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg in the Oval Office of the White House, Thursday, May 17, 2018, in Washington.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) \u8212\'20\'14 President \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  on Thursday defended his use of the word "animals" to describe some immigrants who enter the country illegally, saying he would continue to use the term to refer to violent gang members in spite of a sharp rebuke from Democratic leaders.\par \par \uc2 Answering a reporter's question during a meeting with NATO Secretary-General \uc2 Jens Stoltenberg\uc2 , Trump said his comment a day earlier had clearly been directed at members of the MS-13 gang.\par \par \uc2 "MS-13, these are animals coming onto our country," Trump said, repeating his language from Wednesday. He added: "When the MS-13 comes in, when the other gang members come into our country, I refer to them as animals. And guess what? I always will."\par \par \uc2 Trump has been under fire for comments he made Wednesday while railing against California for its so-called sanctuary immigration policies. Trump was speaking at a roundtable with local California officials when he responded to a comment that had referenced MS-13.\par \par \uc2 "We have people coming into the country, or trying to come in \u8212\'20\'14 and we're stopping a lot of them," Trump said after Fresno County Sheriff Margaret Mims complained about state restrictions that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities. "You wouldn't believe how bad these people are. These aren't people. These are animals."\par \par \uc2 Trump has repeatedly referred to members of the violent street gang as "animals" in speeches, rallies and at White House events. He has also used the term to describe terrorists and school shooters.\par \par \uc2 Senate Minority Leader \uc2 Chuck Schumer\uc2 , D-N.Y., responded on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  to the president, saying, "When all of our great-great-grandparents came to America they weren't 'animals,' and these people aren't either."\par \par \uc2 And House Minority leader \uc2 Nancy Pelosi\uc2  said, "Every day that you think you've seen it all, along comes another manifestation of why their policies are so inhumane."\par \par \uc2 Mexico's foreign ministry\uc2  sent a formal diplomatic letter to the \uc2 U.S. State Department\uc2  complaining that Trump's comments were "absolutely unacceptable." The foreign ministry released a statement saying such comments create a difficult climate for Mexicans living in the United States.\par \par \uc2 But White House press secretary \uc2 Sarah Huckabee Sanders\uc2  defended the president's comments, arguing the word "animals" didn't go far enough.\par \par \uc2 "This is one of the most vicious and deadly gangs that operates by the motto of, 'Rape, control and kill,'" she said, adding that, "If the media and liberals want to defend MS-13, they're more than welcome to. Frankly, I don't think the term that the president used was strong enough."\par \par \uc2 Trump was joined at the Wednesday White House meeting by mayors, sheriffs and other local leaders from California who oppose the state's immigration policies and who applauded his administration's hard-line efforts.\par \par \uc2 "This is your Republican resistance right here against what they're doing in California," said Assemblywoman Melissa Melendez, coopting a term used by Democrats opposed to Trump's presidency. She, like others, said the president and his policies were far more popular in the state than people realize.\par \par \uc2 They were criticizing legislation Gov. Jerry Brown signed into law last year that bars police from asking people about their immigration status or helping federal agents with immigration enforcement. Jail officials can transfer inmates to federal immigration authorities if they have been convicted of one of about 800 crimes, mostly felonies, but not for minor offenses.\par \par \uc2 Brown\uc2  insists the legislation, which took effect Jan. 1, doesn't prevent federal immigration officials from doing their jobs. But the Trump administration has sued to reverse it, calling the policies unconstitutional and dangerous. Some counties, including San Diego and Orange, have voted to support the lawsuit or have passed their own anti-sanctuary resolutions.\par \par \uc2 Republicans see backlash to the law as a potentially galvanizing issue during the midterm elections, especially with Trump's anti-immigrant base. And Trump has held numerous events in recent months during which he's drawn attention to California's policies.\par \par \uc2 During the session, Trump thanked the officials, saying they had "bravely resisted California's deadly and unconstitutional sanctuary state laws." He claimed those laws are forcing "the release of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  criminals, drug dealers, gang members and violent predators into your communities" and providing "safe harbor to some of the most vicious and violent offenders on earth."\par \par \uc2 Brown\uc2  responded on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , writing that Trump "is lying on immigration, lying about crime and lying about the laws of CA."\par \par \uc2 The Democratic governor added: "Flying in a dozen Republican politicians to flatter him and praise his reckless policies changes nothing. We, the citizens of the fifth largest economy in the world, are not impressed."\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writers Alan Fram in Washington, Kathleen Ronayne in Sacramento and Elliot Spagat in San Diego contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 President Donald Trump speaks during a meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg in the Oval Office of the White House, Thursday, May 17, 2018, in Washington.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) \u8212\'20\'14 President \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  on Wednesday hammered California for its so-called sanctuary immigration policies, in what appeared to be his latest push to embolden his base leading into the midterm elections.\par \par \uc2 As the debate over immigration heats up on Capitol Hill, Trump surrounded himself with mayors, sheriffs and other local leaders from California who oppose the state's immigration policies and who applauded his administration's hard-line efforts.\par \par \uc2 "This is your Republican resistance right here against what they're doing in California," said California Assemblywoman Melissa Melendez, coopting a term used by Democrats opposed to Trump's presidency. She, like others, said the president and his policies were far more popular in the state than people realize.\par \par \uc2 "It's a crisis," Melendez said of the situation.\par \par \uc2 They were responding to legislation signed into law by Gov. Jerry Brown last year that bars police from asking people about their immigration status or helping federal agents with immigration enforcement. Jail officials can transfer inmates to federal immigration authorities if they have been convicted of one of about 800 crimes, mostly felonies, but not for minor offenses.\par \par \uc2 Brown\uc2  insists the legislation, which took effect Jan. 1, doesn't prevent federal immigration officials from doing their jobs. But the Trump administration has sued to reverse it, calling the policies unconstitutional and dangerous. Some counties, including San Diego and Orange, have voted to support the lawsuit or passed their own anti-sanctuary resolutions.\par \par \uc2 Republicans see backlash to the law as a potentially galvanizing issue during the midterm elections, especially with Trump's anti-immigrant base. And Trump has held numerous events in recent months during which he's drawn attention to California's policies.\par \par \uc2 During Wednesday's session, Trump thanked the officials, saying they had "bravely resisted California's deadly and unconstitutional sanctuary state laws." He claimed those laws are forcing "the release of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  criminals, drug dealers, gang members and violent predators into your communities" and providing "safe harbor to some of the most vicious and violent offenders on earth."\par \par \uc2 Trump also claimed opposition to the policies was growing, insisting, "There's a revolution going on in California." He referred to some who cross the border illegally as "animals," not people.\par \par \uc2 Brown\uc2  responded on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , writing that Trump "is lying on immigration, lying about crime and lying about the laws of CA."\par \par \uc2 The Democratic governor added: "Flying in a dozen Republican politicians to flatter him and praise his reckless policies changes nothing. We, the citizens of the fifth largest economy in the world, are not impressed."\par \par \uc2 The event came as top House Republicans worked to head off an attempt by party moderates to force roll calls on four immigration bills. Republican leaders privately warned GOP lawmakers Wednesday that such a drive could damage the party's prospects in the fall's congressional elections by dispiriting conservative voters, according to people at the closed-door meeting.\par \par \uc2 The House leaders fear the winning legislation would be a compromise bill backed solidly by Democrats but opposed by most Republicans, an outcome that could anger conservatives, according to Rep. Jeff Denham, R-Calif., a leader of the effort to force the immigration votes.\par \par \uc2 House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., issued the warning, said a second person who was in the room and spoke on condition of anonymity to describe the private conversation.\par \par \uc2 Asked about his remarks, McCarthy said his objection to the procedure was that it would in effect "turn the floor over" to Democrats.\par \par \uc2 House Speaker \uc2 Paul Ryan\uc2  said the petition would be "a big mistake" that would "disunify our majority." He said the leaders were "working with the administration."\par \par \uc2 The moderates said later Wednesday that House leaders were trying to end the immigration standoff and that they could soon see a specific proposal on how to do that.\par \par \uc2 "We're willing to see what this looks like," said \uc2 Rep. Carlos Curbelo\uc2 , R-Fla., a leader of the lawmakers trying to force the House to address the issue. Conservatives had their own session with party leaders and also suggested there had been movement, but offered no specifics.\par \par \uc2 Many of the legislators demanding action face potentially competitive re-election races in congressional districts with large numbers of Hispanic, suburban or agriculture-industry voters with pro-immigration views.\par \par \uc2 Earlier this year, competing bills aimed at protecting young immigrants and toughening border security \u8212\'20\'14 including one backed by Trump \u8212\'20\'14 collapsed in the Senate. The measures never received House votes.\par \par \uc2 The discussion also comes as the Trump administration is under fire for a new policy that is expected to increase the number of children separated from their parents when families cross the border illegally.\par \par \uc2 Trump, in his remarks, wrongly blamed Democrats for forcing his administration's hand.\par \par \uc2 "I know what you're going through right now with families is very tough," he told Homeland Security Secretary \uc2 Kirstjen Nielsen\uc2 , "but those are the bad laws that the Democrats gave us. We have to break up families ... because of the Democrats. It's terrible."\par \par \uc2 But no law "the Democrats gave us" mandates the separation of children from their parents at the border. The administration is using protocols described in a 2008 law designed to combat child trafficking that gave special protections to Central American children at the border. While the bill was authored by Democratic \uc2 Sen. Dianne Feinstein\uc2 , it unanimously passed both houses of Congress and was signed by Republican President \uc2 George W. Bush\uc2  as one of his last acts in office.\par \par \uc2 Nielsen on Tuesday defended the practice, telling a Senate committee that removing children from parents facing criminal charges happens "in the United States every day."\par \par \uc2 Trump also told Nielsen that she was "doing a good job," one week after berating her during a cabinet meeting for failing to halt border crossings.\par \par \uc2 Feinstein issued a statement accusing the Trump administration of "once again attempting to divide Californians and all Americans with today's White House meeting."\par \par \uc2 "Their decision to convene this meeting is about fueling fear of immigrants and scapegoating entire communities," she said.\par \par \uc2 __\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writers Alan Fram in Washington, Kathleen Ronayne in Sacramento and Elliot Spagat in San Diego contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 President Donald Trump listens during a roundtable on immigration policy in California, in the Cabinet Room of the White House, Wednesday, May 16, 2018, in Washington.

Shandarrick Barnes, 41, had pleaded guilty in November to obstructing justice. He's the fourth person to receive a prison sentence after entering a guilty plea in the ongoing federal investigation into a pay-to-play scheme for city contracts. U.S. District Judge Steve Jones initially said he would sentence Barnes to serve three years and one month in federal prison. He then reduced that to two years and eight months to give Barnes credit for five months spent in state custody because of this incident. By Kate Brumback.

A 2014 law changed the process that allows minors to get an abortion with a judge's waiver instead of parental consent. It allowed the judge to appoint a lawyer for the fetus and let the district attorney call witnesses to decide whether the minor was mature enough to have an abortion. By Mallory Moench.

Fortunately, they were duped not by real scammers, but by their own schools \u8212\'20\'14 in simulations meant to make them more adept at spotting real threats. When \uc2 Ohio State University\uc2  did its first student-focused phishing in January \u8212\'20\'14 a strategy also used in the corporate world \u8212\'20\'14 over 18 percent of the recipients clicked through.

In the Trump administration, a popular $500 million transportation grant program is focused more on projects in rural areas that turned out for \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  in the 2016 election. That means more road and rail projects in GOP strongholds such as Idaho, North Dakota, and Oklahoma, and fewer "greenways," ''complete streets" and bike lanes. A port project in Alabama would build a "roll on/roll off" facility that would serve several automobile manufacturing plants. By Andrew Taylor.

About 6 percent of the university's first-time undergraduates last year came from Illinois. Students cite financial incentives as one of the main reasons for flocking to Alabama.

Lawmakers are debating how to close an estimated $700 million gap in the budget year that begins July 1. Health care services have the biggest target for cuts, because those programs account for nearly half of Louisiana's annual operating budget. Over two days of House and Senate budget hearings, managers of the charity hospital system that cares for the poor cautioned of clinic shutdowns and widespread service eliminations if plans to dramatically scale back their financing take hold.

That means more road and rail projects in GOP strongholds such as Idaho, North Dakota, and Oklahoma, and fewer "greenways," ''complete streets" and bike lanes.

(AP) \u8212\'20\'14 A bus driver was sentenced Monday to 15 years in prison for a crash that killed a firefighter and two other people on an interstate in Louisiana.\par \par \uc2 Denis Amaya Rodriguez, a 38-year-old \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Honduras, received the maximum sentence for his conviction in the August 2016 crash on Interstate 10 in LaPlace, local news outlets report.\par \par \uc2 At trial, prosecutors said Amaya was rushing to beat traffic when the bus he was driving plowed into a parked firetruck that had stopped to assist with a crash earlier that morning.\par \par \uc2 St. John the Baptist Parish Fire Chief Spencer Chauvin, Vontarous Kelly, and Jeramine Starr died in the crash. Kelly and Starr, both of Moss Point, Mississippi, were in one of the vehicles struck by the bus.\par \par \uc2 Amaya's attorney said he was driving a defective "party" bus taking more than 30 passengers to Baton Rouge to look for work less than a month after historic flooding damaged or destroyed tens of thousands of homes in southeast Louisiana.\par \par \uc2 State District Court Judge Sterling Snowdy presided over a three-day trial in January before a jury convicted Amaya of three counts of negligent homicide. Each count carried a maximum sentence of five years in prison.\par \par \uc2 During Monday's sentencing hearing, Snowdy said he was "profoundly" concerned by Amaya's poor judgment and described him as a "gross risk to this community, and the driving public," NOLA.com/The Times-Picayune reported.\par \par \uc2 Amaya still faces misdemeanor charges over the injuries sustained by more than three dozen other people. He faces possible deportation once he completes serving his sentence.\par \par \uc2 Amaya, who addressed the judge through a Spanish translator, apologized for the suffering the crash caused but said he didn't consider himself "truly guilty."\par \par \uc2 "If the law says I have to pay, then here I am," he said.\par \par \uc2 Chauvin's widow, Jennifer, told Amaya that her family's "sentence will always be greater" than his.\par \par \uc2 "You sentenced us to a life without Spencer," Jennifer Chauvin said , according to The Advocate.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 Information from: The Advocate, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://theadvocate.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://theadvocate.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020180409ee4900iug\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 PHOENIX (AP) \u8212\'20\'14 Arizona will deploy about 150 members of the state National Guard to the U.S.-Mexico border next week to support President \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 's plan for troops at the border to combat illegal immigration and drug smuggling, Gov. Doug Ducey announced Friday.\par \par \uc2 Ducey said he was working closely with federal officials to coordinate the troop movements.\par \par \uc2 The announcement came two days Trump announced the military border deployment, a move praised by the Republican governor.\par \par \uc2 Texas officials also announced Friday they would be sending 250 troops to the border within 72 hours.\par \par \uc2 Arizona's National Guard said in a statement it activated a team of planners to coordinate the troop movements. The troops will help free up U.S. Border Patrol agents to work in the field by providing air, reconnaissance, operational and logistics support and constructing border infrastructure.\par \par \uc2 Homeland Security Secretary \uc2 Kirstjen Nielsen\uc2  said Wednesday that the Trump administration was using a model similar to a 2006 operation where then-President \uc2 George W. Bush\uc2  deployed National Guard troops. Former President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  also deployed troops to the border in 2010.\par \par \uc2 Arizona Guard troops were activated in both cases, doing border watch missions, supporting border wall construction and helping with administrative and other support tasks.\par \par \uc2 They will remain under state control but all costs will be paid by the federal government.\par \par \uc2 FILE - In this Friday, Jan. 19, 2007 file photo, a National Guard unit patrols the Arizona-Mexico border in Sasabe, Ariz. On Friday, April 6, 2018, Arizona and Texas announced that they were preparing to deploy National Guard members to the U.S.-Mexico border in response to President Donald Trump\u8217\'20\'19s call for more border security. From 2006 to 2008, the Guard fixed vehicles, maintained roads, repaired fences and performed ground surveillance. Its second mission in 2010 and 2011 involved more aerial surveillance and intelligence work. (AP Photo/Ross D.

U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has ordered a "zero tolerance" policy aimed at people entering the United States illegally for the first time on the Mexican border. His directive Friday, April 6, 2018, tells federal prosecutors in border states to put more emphasis on charging people with illegal entry, which has historically been treated as a misdemeanor offense for those with few or no previous encounters with border authorities.

The soldiers are the first National Guard unit along the border as part of Operation Jump Start. Operation Jump Start, from May 2006 to July 2008, sent 6,000 troops to the border in its first year and 3,000 the second year and was framed as a way to buy time amid an unprecedented Border Patrol hiring spree and heavy political pressure for immediate action. The Border Patrol ballooned by thousands of agents during the operation to about 20,000, roughly where it is today.

In 2018, the U.S. National Guard faces a vastly different environment than it did on its last two deployments to the border with Mexico, with far fewer illegal crossings and more Central Americans than Mexicans coming.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) \u8212\'20\'14 An inflammatory ad depicting a Hispanic-looking immigrant in a hoodie shooting a white woman led to an unusual one-issue debate Tuesday night between a Republican who might run for Florida governor and a Democrat already in the race.\par \par \uc2 Republican House Speaker Richard Corcoran and Democratic Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum took an exchange that began on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  two weeks ago to a television studio, debating a priority bill for Corcoran that would punish local governments if they don't cooperate with authorities enforcing federal immigration laws.\par \par \uc2 The two sparred on the issue on social media after Corcoran's political committee began airing an ad call for an end to so-called "sanctuary cities."\par \par \uc2 "There is no need for this policy or this type of legislation other than to deride, to divide and to create other legal forms, in my opinion, of racial profiling," Gillum said during the 50-minute debate which was streamed live on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and will be distributed to television stations.\par \par \uc2 He said Corcoran's ad attempts to make Floridians believe that "undocumented persons are either murders" or intend to harm them.\par \par \uc2 Corcoran said the issue is simple: people in the country illegally who commit crimes should be detained for at least 48 hours to give federal authorities time to act on immigration issues.\par \par \uc2 "This is not even a difficult thing. Is it OK for an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who's engaged in criminal behavior to be allowed out to roam free? That's a simple question," Corcoran said.\par \par \uc2 In his ad, Corcoran talks about a young woman "gunned down by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who should have been deported, but was protected by a sanctuary city." As the ad shows a woman walking past the man in the hoodie, who then turns round and shoots her. He mentions the case of \uc2 Kate Steinle\uc2 , who was fatally shot in San Francisco by a man living in the country illegally and who had been deported five times. A jury found the shooting was accidental and that the bullet was not intended for Steinle, but ricocheted off a concrete piling.\par \par \uc2 Still, Corcoran repeatedly mentioned her in the debate, saying no one should have to be told by a police officer that a loved one was killed by someone who entered the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 Gillum also criticized Corcoran because the actor in the ad was in a hoodie, saying it had racial overtones.\par \par \uc2 Afterward, Corcoran dismissed the idea.\par \par \uc2 "I have a 15-year-old boy. He wears a hoodie all the time," Corcoran said. "The point of the story was that when you allow criminal illegal immigrants to go out there and walk our streets, people are in jeopardy."\par \par \uc2 The debate was unusual because Corcoran isn't a declared candidate for governor, though he's widely expect to join the Republican primary after the Legislature's annual session ends next month. Also, Gillum has yet to debate his opponents in the Democratic primary, which also includes former U.S. Rep. Gwen Graham, former Miami Beach Mayor Philip Levine and Orlando businessman Chris King.\par \par \uc2 The day before the debate, Levine began airing television ads using a clip from the Corcoran ad, in which Levine says, "One Tallahassee politician is broadcasting a message of hate, aimed at every man, woman and child that doesn't look like him."\par \par \uc2 Republicans running for the seat Republican \uc2 Gov. Rick Scott\uc2  is giving up due to term limits are Agriculture Commissioner \uc2 Adam Putnam\uc2  and U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis.\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020180213ee2d00af1\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

February 9, 2018\par \par \uc2 Fairness demands end to emissions tests in NWI\par \par \uc2 The Indiana Senate unanimously stands with Northwest Indiana on an important matter of regional equity, and the federal government should be taking note.\par \par \uc2 The state Senate recently approved a resolution demanding that the federal government nix unfair vehicle emissions testing for Lake and Porter county drivers.\par \par \uc2 Our contingent of federal lawmakers should be listening and pushing for compliance with the Indiana Senate's demands.\par \par \uc2 Specifically, the resolution asks that Lake and Porter counties be removed from the federal government's Chicago air quality monitoring zone, prompted by occasional poor air quality in Illinois and Wisconsin.\par \par \uc2 Sen. Rick Niemeyer, R-Lowell, sponsored the resolution, garnering an avalanche of support from the rest of the Senate.\par \par \uc2 Niemeyer rightly points out that vehicles owned by Northwest Indiana residents contribute just a fraction of the ozone produced in the Region.\par \par \uc2 Just think of the thousands of cars and trucks that travel daily through our Region via the Interstates versus local traffic.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, Lake and Porter county air quality monitors continue to improve, with the only offending levels remaining in Chicago, Niemeyer argues.\par \par \uc2 "We're victims of what's happening in the Chicago district, and it's totally unfair and too expensive," state Sen. Frank Mrvan, D-Hammond, said in support of the resolution.\par \par \uc2 Indiana spends about $5 million annually for vehicle emissions tests. The federal government contributes an additional $5 million on Region Clean Air Car Check stations.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, Region drivers spend an unknown amount on vehicle repairs if they are unable to pass emissions tests in the two counties.\par \par \uc2 It's an obligation not borne by drivers living in other parts of the state.\par \par \uc2 Fairness must be brought to bear on this issue, and the money tied up in unneeded Northwest Indiana vehicle emissions tests should be funneled to more pressing endeavors.\par \par \uc2 The federal government should end this unfair and archaic requirement without delay.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 Terre Haute Tribune-Star. February 7, 2018\par \par \uc2 Keep politics out of crash\par \par \uc2 Tragic deaths on I-70 caused by suspected drunken driver\par \par \uc2 The tragic highway crash that took the lives of Indianapolis Colts linebacker Edwin Jackson and ride-share driver Jeffrey Monroe should not be politicized.\par \par \uc2 Unfortunately, politicians quickly seized upon Sunday's deadly collision as fodder for their side in the ongoing immigration debate. The incident has more to do with the scourge of drunken driving, but addressing that problem is far too thorny and complicated. Instead, President Trump and members of Congress illuminated the news that the driver of the pickup truck that rammed into Monroe's car \u8212\'20\'14 stopped on the shoulder of Interstate 70 because his passenger, Jackson, had become ill \u8212\'20\'14 was a twice-deported \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . Indiana State Police said Jackson and Monroe were outside the car, and were struck by a Ford F-150 driven by a 37-year-old Guatemala native, Manuel Orrego-Savala.\par \par \uc2 The pickup driver had been deported by Immigration Customs Enforcement in 2007 and 2009, the Indianapolis Star reported, but somehow he was back in the U.S. ISP said his blood-alcohol content was nearly three times the legal limit when his truck hit Jackson, 26, and Monroe, 54, just before 4 a.m. Sunday.\par \par \uc2 ICE told the Star that Orrego-Savala entered the country in 2004, got convicted of a DUI in 2005 in California, and was deported in '07, then again in '09. On Wednesday, he was charged with two counts of leaving the scene of an accident and two counts of drunken driving causing death.\par \par \uc2 The president wrote on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  of the incident that it was "disgraceful that a person illegally in our country killed Colts linebacker Edwin Jackson," adding, "We must get the Dems to get tough on the Border and with illegal immigration. FAST!"\par \par \uc2 The problems surrounding illegal immigration in this country need careful research, kept in context to all the various issues involved, including the fate of young people in the DACA program. Characterizing the suspect in this horrible crash as the typical undocumented immigrant skews reality. Though more definitive data is needed, separate studies by the \uc2 National Academy of Sciences\uc2  in 2015 and the libertarian \uc2 Cato Institute\uc2  last year show that illegal immigrants generally commit crimes at lower rates than U.S. natives.\par \par \uc2 Trump made no mention of changing or cracking down on drunken driving laws, yet alcohol-impaired drivers killed 10,265 Americans in 2015, according to the CDC.\par \par \uc2 The sad crash that killed Jackson, an upcoming young athlete, and Monroe, an Uber driver, should be handled on its own merits by prosecutors and the criminal justice system in Indianapolis. Likewise, the illegal immigration problem should be dealt with on its own terms, broadly and comprehensively; Sunday's I-70 tragedy should be left out of those discussions.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 South Bend Tribune. February 7, 2018\par \par \uc2 Put the brakes on payday loan bill\par \par \uc2 Payday lenders across the state may have found a new way to skirt annual interest rate restrictions in a bill winding its way through the Indiana General Assembly.\par \par \uc2 House Bill 1319, which passed the House last week by a 53-41 vote, would allow payday lenders to charge fees triple what Indiana law currently defines as criminal loan-sharking.\par \par \uc2 The bill would allow storefront lenders the ability to offer short-term loans \u8212\'20\'14 typically about two weeks \u8212\'20\'14 of $605 to $1,500 with annual percentage rates up to 222 percent.\par \par \uc2 Under current law, rates of more than 72 percent are considered felony loan-sharking.\par \par \uc2 Payday loan officials argue the new process would fill a need not currently served through conventional loan channels, helping customers short on cash with poor credit who have nowhere else to turn. The bill also includes some protections that would prohibit loans if the monthly payments exceed 20 percent of the borrower's monthly income.\par \par \uc2 But opponents say such high-interest loans prey on the very people who can least afford it, trapping those who live paycheck to paycheck in a cycle of borrowing, repaying and re-borrowing.\par \par \uc2 The Indiana Institute for Working Families is leading opposition to the bill which includes a host of veterans groups, social services agencies and faith communities.\par \par \uc2 There is a better alternative than HB 1319. Sen. Greg Walker, of Columbus, offered a bill that would cap annualized interest rates on payday loans at 36 percent, something 88 percent of Hoosier voters said in a recent poll they would support. But Walker's bill didn't even get a hearing.\par \par \uc2 HB 1319 has now been moved to a Senate committee for study.\par \par \uc2 That's as far as this legislation should go. Lawmakers should stop this bill from advancing any further. They shouldn't make it any easier for the payday lending industry to take advantage of already financially vulnerable Hoosiers.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 The (Fort Wayne) Journal Gazette. February 9, 2018\par \par \uc2 Gerrymandering in action\par \par \uc2 Redistricting reform didn't make the cut as legislative priorities for either the Indiana House or Senate majority, so it's no surprise Republican leaders omitted any mention of it among accomplishments for the first half of the session. The House failed to advance any measure; Senate Bill 326 falls far short of what's needed to help restore fairness and integrity to the electoral system.\par \par \uc2 Another half-time measure illustrates just one problem resulting from a rigged redistricting process: At the deadline for scheduled committee reports, 48 percent of Republican-authored bills were still alive; just 5 percent of bills authored by Democrats remained in play. Eighty of the 85 bills filed by Senate Democrats died without being heard in committee, including SB 77, which would have created an independent, nonpartisan redistricting commission.\par \par \uc2 In short, the legislative aims of representatives elected by thousands of Hoosiers statewide are given no chance to proceed. Democracy is not well served when gerrymandering creates supermajority control, which in turn is used to silence the minority party. Drawing districts to one party's advantage also fuels voter apathy, uncontested elections, incumbent protection and an agenda held hostage by the fringes of one party.\par \par \uc2 But Senate and House leaders make no apologies for their failure to fix redistricting. Both House bills on the issue, including one introduced by Rep. Jerry Torr, R-Carmel, died in the Elections Committee, where Chairman Milo Smith, R-Columbus, has singlehandedly kept efforts to establish an independent commission from advancing. House Speaker Brian Bosma disingenuously signed on as co-author to Torr's bill, but his appointment of Smith as committee chairman ensured the bill was going nowhere.\par \par \uc2 Likewise, Senate bills that would have created a redistricting commission also were allowed to die. The surviving SB 326 is a token measure. It sets standards for drawing congressional and legislative districts without addressing the key issue of who is drawing the districts. As long as it is the legislators themselves, voters should have no confidence in the process.\par \par \uc2 Torr, the Carmel Republican who has long supported redistricting reform, predicted in the first week of the session his bill would go nowhere.\par \par \uc2 "We'll have a difficult time because we have so many Republicans now who have never served in the minority," the 11-term lawmaker told the Indianapolis Business Journal. "It's a hard sell. And the chairman of the committee doesn't like it."\par \par \uc2 The Special Interim Committee on Redistricting voted nearly two years ago to recommend establishment of an independent panel to draw maps after the 2020 Census. Twice now, the GOP-controlled legislature has ignored opportunities to do so. Indiana voters, who will return to the polls this year, now have an opportunity to tell lawmakers what they would like.\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020180213ee2d00kzn\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The president also prodded Democrats to work with him on illegal immigration and border security.\par \par \uc2 The driver believed to be responsible for Sunday's crash on Interstate 70 in Indianapolis had been deported twice in the last decade.\par \par \uc2 Trump tweeted Tuesday: "So disgraceful that a person illegally in our country killed (at)Colts linebacker Edwin Jackson. This is just one of many such preventable tragedies. We must get the Dems to get tough on the Border, and with illegal immigration, FAST!"\par \par \uc2 In a second tweet, he added, "My prayers and best wishes are with the family of Edwin Jackson, a wonderful young man whose life was so senselessly taken. (at)Colts."\par \par \uc2 The collision also killed Jackson's Uber driver, Jeffrey Monroe, who was not mentioned by the president.\par \par \uc2 Since the 2016 campaign, Trump has regularly pointed to crimes connected to illegal immigration as evidence that the U.S. needs to build a wall along the Mexican border and tighten immigration policies. As president, he has threatened to withhold federal funding to cities with sanctuary city policies.\par \par \uc2 The man suspected of causing the collision, 37-year-old Manuel Orrego-Savala, had a 2005 conviction for driving under the influence in Redwood City, California. He also has numerous other misdemeanor convictions and arrests in California and Indiana, said \uc2 Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2  spokeswoman Nicole Alberico.\par \par \uc2 In the 2005 case, he pleaded no contest to two separate drunken driving offenses and was given a brief jail sentence, San Mateo County District Attorney Steve Wagstaffe said Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 Orrego-Savala remained jailed in Indianapolis but had not been formally charged in the crash. Prosecutors said they were working with police on the investigation.\par \par \uc2 The suspect appeared Tuesday before a judge who advised him of his rights. Indianapolis television station WRTV reported that Orrego-Savala told the judge through an interpreter: "I wasn't driving the car. I don't know why I am here." Another court hearing was scheduled for Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 The Guatemala citizen, who gave officers a fake name when he was arrested, was deported in 2007 and 2009, police said.\par \par \uc2 Jackson, 26, and Monroe, 54, were standing outside Monroe's car along I-70 after Jackson became ill while Monroe was transporting him for the ride-hailing company, police said.\par \par \uc2 Both men were struck and killed by a pickup truck driven by Orrego-Savala, police said. Investigators said they believe Orrego-Savala, who lives in Indianapolis, was intoxicated and driving without a license.\par \par \uc2 A breath test administered at the crash scene found that Orrego-Savala's blood-alcohol content was almost 0.24 percent, or nearly three times Indiana's legal limit of 0.08 percent, according to an affidavit.\par \par \uc2 Orrego-Savala had prior run-ins with law enforcement for driving without a valid license, the affidavit said.\par \par \uc2 The state trooper who discovered the wreckage shortly before 4 a.m. Sunday accidentally struck one of the victims before he could stop, police said.\par \par \uc2 State Police Sgt. John Perrine did not immediately disclose Tuesday whether Jackson or Monroe were struck by the trooper's car, but he said investigators believe that man was already dead when the trooper's car hit him in the center lane. He said a coroner will be looking into that victim's specific cause of death.\par \par \uc2 Orrego-Savala was walking away from the crash scene when the same trooper detained him.\par \par \uc2 Republican Indiana Rep. Todd Rokita said that "the loss of life at the hands of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  criminals should make all Hoosiers sad and ultimately angry."\par \par \uc2 The crash highlights the need for building a U.S.-Mexico border wall, "ending sanctuary cities and stopping illegal immigration once and for all," he said in a statement.\par \par \uc2 The fatalities come about two months after a California jury acquitted a Mexican man in the fatal July 2015 shooting of a woman on a San Francisco pier \u8212\'20\'14 a death that touched off a fierce national immigration debate.\par \par \uc2 Jose Ines Garcia Zarate\uc2 , who was acquitted of murder on Nov. 30 in \uc2 Kate Steinle\uc2 's death, had been deported five times and was wanted for a sixth deportation when she was fatally shot. Garcia Zarate said the shooting was accidental and occurred when picked up a gun wrapped in a T-shirt under a seat on the pier.\par \par \uc2 Steinle's death was often cited by Trump as a reason to crack down on illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 Jackson, who grew up in Atlanta, started eight games for the Colts during the 2016 season, finishing third on the team with 61 tackles. He was considered a possible starter at inside linebacker for the 2017 season but missed the season after suffering an injury during training camp.\par \par \uc2 The 6-foot, 234-pound athlete previously played for the \uc2 Arizona Cardinals\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Colts owner Jim Irsay has offered to pay for both Jackson and Monroe's funerals, the team's chief operating officer, Pete Ward, said.\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020180206ee2600prv\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The president also prodded Democrats to work with him on illegal immigration and border security. The crash killed linebacker Edwin Jackson and his Uber driver on Sunday. Authorities say the man suspected of causing the crash has twice been deported from the U.S.\par \par \uc2 By RICK CALLAHAN\par \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \par \uc2 INDIANAPOLIS (AP) \u8212\'20\'14 President Donald Trump said it was "disgraceful" that an Indianapolis Colts linebacker was killed in a suspected drunken-driving crash by a person who is in the U.S. illegally.\par \par \uc2 The president also prodded Democrats to work with him on illegal immigration and border security.\par \par \uc2 Trump tweeted Tuesday: "So disgraceful that a person illegally in our country killed (at)Colts linebacker Edwin Jackson. This is just one of many such preventable tragedies. We must get the Dems to get tough on the Border, and with illegal immigration, FAST!"\par \par \uc2 In a second tweet, he added, "My prayers and best wishes are with the family of Edwin Jackson, a wonderful young man whose life was so senselessly taken. (at)Colts."\par \par \uc2 The crash also killed Jackson's Uber driver, who was not mentioned by Trump.\par \par \uc2 The man suspected of causing the collision Sunday has twice been deported from the U.S., authorities said.\par \par \uc2 Manuel Orrego-Savala, 37, remained jailed Monday but had not been charged in the crash along Interstate 70 in Indianapolis. Prosecutors said they were working with police on the investigation.\par \par \uc2 The Guatemala citizen, who gave officers a fake name when he was arrested, was deported in 2007 and 2009, and was again living illegally in the U.S., police said.\par \par \uc2 Jackson, 26, and driver Jeffrey Monroe, 54, were standing outside Monroe's car along I-70 after Jackson became ill while Monroe was transporting him for the ride-hailing company, police said.\par \par \uc2 Both men were struck and killed by a pickup truck driven by Orrego-Savala, police said. Investigators said they believe Orrego-Savala, who lives in Indianapolis, was intoxicated and driving without a license.\par \par \uc2 A breath test administered at the crash scene found that Orrego-Savala's blood-alcohol content was almost 0.24 percent, or nearly three times Indiana's legal limit of 0.08 percent, according to an affidavit.\par \par \uc2 That affidavit said Orrego-Savala has had prior run-ins with law enforcement for driving without a valid license and that he was walking away from the crash scene when an Indiana state trooper detained him.\par \par \uc2 Republican Indiana Rep. Todd Rokita said that "the loss of life at the hands of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  criminals should make all Hoosiers sad and ultimately angry."\par \par \uc2 The crash highlights the need for building a U.S.-Mexico border wall, "ending sanctuary cities and stopping illegal immigration once and for all," he said in a statement.\par \par \uc2 The fatalities come about two months after a California jury acquitted a Mexican man in the fatal July 2015 shooting of a woman on a San Francisco pier \u8212\'20\'14 a death that touched off a fierce national immigration debate.\par \par \uc2 Jose Ines Garcia Zarate\uc2 , who was found not guilty of murder on Nov. 30 in \uc2 Kate Steinle\uc2 's death, had been deported five times and was wanted for a sixth deportation when she was fatally shot. Garcia Zarate said the shooting was accidental and occurred when picked up a gun wrapped in a T-shirt under a seat on the pier.\par \par \uc2 During the presidential campaign, then-candidate Trump pointed to Steinle's death as a reason to build a wall along the Mexican border and tighten immigration policies. As president, he has threatened to withhold federal funding to cities with sanctuary city policies.\par \par \uc2 Jackson, who grew up in Atlanta, started eight games for the Colts during the 2016 season, finishing third on the team with 61 tackles. He was considered a possible starter at inside linebacker for the 2017 but missed the season after suffering an injury during training camp.\par \par \uc2 The 6-foot, 234-pound athlete previously played for the \uc2 Arizona Cardinals\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020180206ee2600k7u\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 INDIANAPOLIS (AP) \u8212\'20\'14 A man being held in a suspected drunken-driving crash that killed Indianapolis Colts linebacker Edwin Jackson and his Uber driver has been twice deported from the U.S. \u8212\'20\'14 a revelation an Indiana congressman said Monday should anger "all Americans."\par \par \uc2 Manuel Orrego-Savala, 37, remained jailed Monday but has not been charged in Sunday's deadly crash along Interstate 70 in Indianapolis. State Police said Monday that he's a citizen of Guatemala who gave officers a fake name when he was arrested following the pre-dawn crash.\par \par \uc2 Investigators said he was deported in 2007 and 2009, and was again living illegally in the U.S.\par \par \uc2 Police said Jackson, who grew up in Atlanta, and Uber driver Jeffrey Monroe, 54, were standing outside Monroe's car along I-70 after Jackson became ill while Monroe was transporting him for the ride-hailing company.\par \par \uc2 Both men were struck and killed by a pickup truck driven by Orrego-Savala, police said. Investigators said they believe Orrego-Savala, who lives in Indianapolis, was intoxicated and driving without a license.\par \par \uc2 A breath test administered at the crash scene found that Orrego-Savala's blood-alcohol content was 0.239 percent, or nearly three times Indiana's legal limit of 0.08 percent, according to a probable cause affidavit.\par \par \uc2 That affidavit, which was filed Sunday under the fake name Manuel Orrego-Savala gave police, also states two vials of blood were drawn from Orrego-Savala by a nurse at a hospital about 90 minutes later and sent for analysis. It said Orrego-Savala has prior run-ins with law enforcement for driving without a valid license and that he was walking away from the crash scene when an Indiana state trooper arrived and detained him.\par \par \uc2 Republican U.S. Rep. Todd Rokita said Monday in a statement after police released details on Orrego-Savala that "the loss of life at the hands of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  criminals should make all Hoosiers sad and ultimately angry."\par \par \uc2 He added that the fatal accident highlights the need for building a U.S.-Mexico border wall, "ending sanctuary cities, and stopping illegal immigration once and for all."\par \par \uc2 Rokita later tweeted that "this news should make all Americans angry."\par \par \uc2 The deaths of Jackson and Monroe come about two months after a California jury acquitted a Mexican man in the fatal July 2015 shooting of a woman on a San Francisco pier \u8212\'20\'14 a death that touched off a fierce national immigration debate.\par \par \uc2 Jose Ines Garcia Zarate\uc2 , who was found not guilty of murder on Nov. 30 in \uc2 Kate Steinle\uc2 's death, had been deported five times and was wanted for a sixth deportation when she was fatally shot. Garcia Zarate said the shooting was accidental and occurred when picked up a gun wrapped in a T-shirt under a seat on the pier.\par \par \uc2 During the presidential campaign, then-candidate \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  pointed to Steinle's death as a reason to build a wall along the Mexican border and tighten immigration policies. As president, he has threatened to withhold federal funding to cities with sanctuary city policies.\par \par \uc2 Orrego-Savala remained in the Marion County Jail on Monday as the investigation into Sunday's crash continues. The Marion County Prosecutor's Office was working with police on "potential criminal charges" in the case, spokeswoman Peg McLeish said.\par \par \uc2 Jackson, 26, started eight games for the Colts during the 2016 season, finishing third on the team with 61 tackles. He was considered a possible starter at inside linebacker for the 2017 but missed the season after suffering an injury during training camp.\par \par \uc2 The 6-foot, 234-pound Jackson previously played for the \uc2 Arizona Cardinals\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The Colts said in a statement Sunday that Jackson "was well-respected among all with whom he crossed paths, and he will be greatly missed in our locker room and throughout our entire organization."\par \par \uc2 FILE - In this Nov. 20, 2016 file photo, Indianapolis Colts linebacker Edwin Jackson (53) walks off the field following an NFL football game against the Tennessee Titans in Indianapolis.

Police say Jackson and Uber driver Jeffrey Monroe were standing outside their car along Interstate 70 in Indianapolis when they were fatally hit by a pickup truck being driven by the Guatemala citizen.\par \par \uc2 By RICK CALLAHAN\par \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \par \uc2 INDIANAPOLIS (AP) \u8212\'20\'14 A man being held in a suspected drunken-driving crash that killed Indianapolis Colts linebacker Edwin Jackson and his Uber driver has been twice deported from the U.S. \u8212\'20\'14 a revelation an Indiana congressman said Monday should anger "all Americans."\par \par \uc2 Manuel Orrego-Savala, 37, remained jailed Monday but has not been charged in Sunday's deadly crash along Interstate 70 in Indianapolis. State Police said Monday that he's a citizen of Guatemala who gave officers a fake name when he was arrested following the pre-dawn crash.\par \par \uc2 Investigators said he was deported in 2007 and 2009, and was again living illegally in the U.S.\par \par \uc2 Police said Jackson, who grew up in Atlanta, and Uber driver Jeffrey Monroe, 54, were standing outside Monroe's car along I-70 after Jackson became ill while Monroe was transporting him for the ride-hailing company.\par \par \uc2 Both men were struck and killed by a pickup truck driven by Orrego-Savala, police said. Investigators said they believe Orrego-Savala, who lives in Indianapolis, was intoxicated and driving without a license.\par \par \uc2 A breath test administered at the crash scene found that Orrego-Savala's blood-alcohol content was 0.239 percent, or nearly three times Indiana's legal limit of 0.08 percent, according to a probable cause affidavit.\par \par \uc2 That affidavit, which was filed Sunday under the fake name Manuel Orrego-Savala gave police, also states two vials of blood were drawn from Orrego-Savala by a nurse at a hospital about 90 minutes later and sent for analysis. It said Orrego-Savala has prior run-ins with law enforcement for driving without a valid license and that he was walking away from the crash scene when an Indiana state trooper arrived and detained him.\par \par \uc2 Republican U.S. Rep. Todd Rokita said Monday in a statement after police released details on Orrego-Savala that "the loss of life at the hands of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  criminals should make all Hoosiers sad and ultimately angry."\par \par \uc2 He added that the fatal accident highlights the need for building a U.S.-Mexico border wall, "ending sanctuary cities, and stopping illegal immigration once and for all."\par \par \uc2 Rokita later tweeted that "this news should make all Americans angry."\par \par \uc2 The deaths of Jackson and Monroe come about two months after a California jury acquitted a Mexican man in the fatal July 2015 shooting of a woman on a San Francisco pier \u8212\'20\'14 a death that touched off a fierce national immigration debate.\par \par \uc2 Jose Ines Garcia Zarate\uc2 , who was found not guilty of murder on Nov. 30 in \uc2 Kate Steinle\uc2 's death, had been deported five times and was wanted for a sixth deportation when she was fatally shot. Garcia Zarate said the shooting was accidental and occurred when picked up a gun wrapped in a T-shirt under a seat on the pier.\par \par \uc2 During the presidential campaign, then-candidate \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  pointed to Steinle's death as a reason to build a wall along the Mexican border and tighten immigration policies. As president, he has threatened to withhold federal funding to cities with sanctuary city policies.\par \par \uc2 Orrego-Savala remained in the Marion County Jail on Monday as the investigation into Sunday's crash continues. The Marion County Prosecutor's Office was working with police on "potential criminal charges" in the case, spokeswoman Peg McLeish said.\par \par \uc2 Jackson, 26, started eight games for the Colts during the 2016 season, finishing third on the team with 61 tackles. He was considered a possible starter at inside linebacker for the 2017 but missed the season after suffering an injury during training camp.\par \par \uc2 The 6-foot, 234-pound Jackson previously played for the \uc2 Arizona Cardinals\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The Colts said in a statement Sunday that Jackson "was well-respected among all with whom he crossed paths, and he will be greatly missed in our locker room and throughout our entire organization."\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020180205ee2500qp6\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

State Police said Monday that he's a citizen of Guatemala who gave officers a fake name when he was arrested following the pre-dawn crash.\par \par \uc2 Investigators said he was deported in 2007 and 2009, and was again living illegally in the U.S.\par \par \uc2 Police said Jackson, who grew up in Atlanta, and Uber driver Jeffrey Monroe, 54, were standing outside Monroe's car along I-70 after Jackson became ill while Monroe was transporting him for the ride-hailing company.\par \par \uc2 Both men were struck and killed by a pickup truck driven by Orrego-Savala, police said. Investigators said they believe Orrego-Savala, who lives in Indianapolis, was intoxicated and driving without a license.\par \par \uc2 Republican U.S. Rep. Todd Rokita said Monday in a statement after police released details on Orrego-Savala that "the loss of life at the hands of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  criminals should make all Hoosiers sad and ultimately angry."\par \par \uc2 He added that the fatal accident highlights the need for building a U.S.-Mexico border wall, "ending sanctuary cities, and stopping illegal immigration once and for all."\par \par \uc2 Rokita later tweeted that "this news should make all Americans angry."\par \par \uc2 The deaths of Jackson and Monroe come about two months after a California jury acquitted a Mexican man in the fatal July 2015 shooting of a woman on a San Francisco pier \u8212\'20\'14 a death that touched off a fierce national immigration debate.\par \par \uc2 Jose Ines Garcia Zarate\uc2 , who was found not guilty of murder on Nov. 30 in \uc2 Kate Steinle\uc2 's death, had been deported five times and was wanted for a sixth deportation when she was fatally shot. Garcia Zarate said the shooting was accidental and occurred when picked up a gun wrapped in a T-shirt under a seat on the pier.\par \par \uc2 During the presidential campaign, then-candidate Donald Trump pointed to Steinle's death as a reason to build a wall along the Mexican border and tighten immigration policies. As president, he has threatened to withhold federal funding to cities with sanctuary city policies.\par \par \uc2 Orrego-Savala remained in the Marion County Jail on Monday as the investigation into Sunday's crash continues. The Marion County Prosecutor's Office was working with police on "potential criminal charges" in the case, spokeswoman Peg McLeish said.\par \par \uc2 Jackson, 26, started eight games for the Colts during the 2016 season, finishing third on the team with 61 tackles. He was considered a possible starter at inside linebacker for the 2017 but missed the season after suffering an injury during training camp.\par \par \uc2 The 6-foot, 234-pound Jackson previously played for the \uc2 Arizona Cardinals\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The Colts said in a statement Sunday that Jackson "was well-respected among all with whom he crossed paths, and he will be greatly missed in our locker room and throughout our entire organization."\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020180205ee2500opo\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) \u8212\'20\'14 A defense attorney admitted Tuesday that his client killed two Northern California sheriff's deputies in a daylong rampage, fighting to spare him from the death penalty despite his profane outbursts in court.\par \par \uc2 Defense lawyer Jeffrey Barbour told jurors that Luis Enrique Monroy Bracamontes shot Sacramento sheriff's Deputy Danny Oliver outside a Sacramento motel in October 2014 and later killed Placer County Sheriff's Deputy Michael Davis Jr. in Auburn, 30 miles away.\par \par \uc2 "He shot them both," Barbour said, The Sacramento Bee reported .\par \par \uc2 But he urged jurors to listen to the evidence so they can consider it during the penalty phase if Bracamontes is convicted.\par \par \uc2 That includes that Bracamontes, 37, was high on methamphetamine that may have made him paranoid and agitated, and that he tried to kill himself and responding officers by turning on the gas in a house where he hid before surrendering. Barbour said Bracamontes wrote a suicide note before surrendering.\par \par \uc2 "Forgive me, God," the note read. "Please take me with you. I love you, Janelle."\par \par \uc2 His wife, Janelle Monroy, 41, is also charged in the twin slayings.\par \par \uc2 Barbour spoke hours after Bracamontes called one slain officer's partner a "coward" amid a series of profane and incriminating statements.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutor Rod Norgaard was describing in his opening statement how Deputy Scott Brown retreated under heavy fire that killed Oliver.\par \par \uc2 Bacamontes grinned, then called Brown a "coward" before he was admonished by Sacramento Superior Court Judge Steve White.\par \par \uc2 "I wish I had killed more of the mother-------," Bracamontes later told jurors, adding that "I will break out soon and I will kill more, kill whoever gets in front of me...There's no need for a f------ trial."\par \par \uc2 White briefly removed the jury as defense attorneys said Bracamontes' statements were more signs that their client is unfit to stand trial.\par \par \uc2 "We believe Mr. Bracamontes' outbursts, his laughter, are a function of his mental illness...," Barbour said.\par \par \uc2 White again ruled that Bracamontes is competent, but he warned Bracamontes that he could be removed from court.\par \par \uc2 Bracamontes has shouted that he is guilty and asked to be put to death in previous court hearings. He has threatened to kill his defense attorneys and more deputies, and once had to be restrained after White ruled that he can't fire his lawyers.\par \par \uc2 Bracamontes is a Mexican citizen who repeatedly entered the United States illegally. His wife, who is an American citizen, faces life in prison if she is convicted.\par \par \uc2 His public defenders have argued that anti-immigrant sentiment spurred by President \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  has made it unlikely that Bracamontes can get a fair trial. They have tried, without success, to enter a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity.\par \par \uc2 Bracamontes was heavily shackled in court, while Monroy, who has mostly remained quiet, was wearing a gray and black dress without shackles or chains. He grinned during part of Norgaard's statement and laughed when Norgaard said Bracamontes cared only about his dogs.\par \par \uc2 Separate juries are hearing the cases against the couple. Only jurors hearing Bracamontes' case were in court at the time of his comments.\par \par \uc2 His wife has contended that she was a victim of her abusive and paranoid husband who frequently used methamphetamine, marijuana and alcohol during a meandering journey across several western states, from their home in Utah to Sacramento.\par \par \uc2 FILE - In this Oct, 28, 2014 file photo, flowers surround a photo of slain Sacramento County Deputy Sheriff Daniel Oliver at the Sacramento County Sheriff's office in Sacramento, Calif.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Here are excerpts from recent editorials in Texas newspapers:\par \par \uc2 Amarillo Globe-News. Jan. 1, 2018.\par \par \uc2 At least four bills in the 85th regular session of the Texas Legislature that would have addressed an unfair law in the Lone Star State failed to go much of anywhere.\par \par \uc2 The bills were related to a state law, which has been around since 2001, granting in-state college tuition to \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students.\par \par \uc2 Some describe the law in more politically-correct (if not nonsensical) terms. A December post on {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.mystatesman.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 www.mystatesman.com}}}\uc2  painted the law as benefiting "college students from Texas living in the United States without legal permission."\par \par \uc2 How can a student be considered to be "from Texas" if this student does not have "legal permission" to be in the United States in the first place? The amount of politically-correct spin in this statement is beyond dizzying.\par \par \uc2 But back to the fairness \u8212\'20\'14 or unfairness \u8212\'20\'14 of the aforementioned law.\par \par \uc2 Why is it the state of Texas considers it fair for a student living in Texas "without legal permission" (should this not be considered illegal?) to receive a financial benefit that a legal resident of a neighboring state is not eligible to receive?\par \par \uc2 How is this fair? The logical answer \u8212\'20\'14 it is not fair.\par \par \uc2 For those who have not priced the cost of a college education lately, there is a significant difference between in-state tuition rates and out-of-state tuition rates.\par \par \uc2 Why should a legal resident of Oklahoma, New Mexico or Louisiana face the higher cost of attending a college or university in Texas, while an illegal resident (who, according to the law, must have lived in Texas for all of three years) be entitled to lower in-state tuition? There is no logical reason.\par \par \uc2 Thankfully, at least the aforementioned law does require students living in Texas "without legal permission" to at least earn a high school degree. (Sarcasm noted.)\par \par \uc2 It seems unlikely there will be much progress in future sessions of the Texas Legislature as far as repealing or fixing this politically-correct law which ignores immigration laws and grants special financial benefits not available to legal residents who happen to be from outside the state of Texas.\par \par \uc2 The unfair aspect of this law continues.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 Houston Chronicle. Jan. 1, 2018.\par \par \uc2 Angry letters to the editor, long lines at public hearings and heartbroken stories of dashed expectations were all signs of a people losing confidence in a state agency.\par \par \uc2 That's what Texas saw last year following the Chronicle's publication of the series "Denied" disclosing that the \uc2 Texas Education Agency\uc2  had imposed an arbitrary 8.5 percent cap for decades on special education services for children in Texas public schools.\par \par \uc2 TEA has since renounced the cruel policy, and a law was passed to make sure that special ed students are not the targets of an arbitrary cap again. Notwithstanding these actions, the agency remains in a hole with regard to public trust.\par \par \uc2 In the upcoming year, Texas Education Commissioner Mike Morath should continue to work hard to rebuild agency credibility through open and aboveboard communication and effective management.\par \par \uc2 Unfortunately, progress at the agency remains uneven, and these past months \u8212\'20\'14 when the agency has been involved in a high profile kerfuffle regarding a $4.4 million no bid contract \u8212\'20\'14 are no exception.\par \par \uc2 A few weeks ago, Morath ordered an immediate end to the contract with a Georgia-based company engaged to help overhaul special education practices by analyzing thousands of personal records of students with disabilities. The termination came amidst allegations of favoritism within the agency in awarding the bid, charges of firing a whistleblower and accusations against the dismissed employee of covering up sex abuse in another state.\par \par \uc2 Such messy circumstances can only inspire further distrust.\par \par \uc2 Morath has ordered a review of contracting processes. But that won't claw back the $2.2 million in federal funds that the agency has already paid for services rendered under the terminated contract.\par \par \uc2 "It feels like a very, very disturbing waste of money," Cheryl Fries, founder of parent advocacy group Texans for Special Education Reform, told The Texas Tribune.\par \par \uc2 Other questions linger as well. Were there sufficient grounds for the contract to be entered into with a relatively unknown company without competitive bidding? What direction will the agency take in moving forward? When will the agency take steps to reach out to the families of special needs children who were denied services? Did the agency follow state procurement laws in awarding the contract?\par \par \uc2 "The way to make people trustworthy is to trust them," Ernest Hemingway once wrote. Families all over Texas want and need to trust the TEA to be an ally in educating their special needs child. But TEA needs to get its act together and consistently behave in a trustworthy manner. In attempting to rebuild the agency's reputation, Morath needs to be mindful that every decision counts.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 Corpus Christi Caller-Times. Jan. 2, 2018.\par \par \uc2 For a self-proclaimed great negotiator, President Trump has staked out a curious position for himself on Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, aka DACA. It reminds us of a scene in the western movie spoof "Blazing Saddles," in which the central character takes himself hostage, putting his gun to his head to stave off a lynch mob.\par \par \uc2 Trump recently tweeted: "The Democrats have been told, and fully understand, that there can be no DACA without the desperately needed WALL at the Southern Border and an END to the horrible Chain Migration & ridiculous Lottery System of Immigration etc. We must protect our Country at all cost!"\par \par \uc2 He followed up with a tweet that Democrats are doing nothing for DACA and that its recipients, the so-called DREAMers \u8212\'20\'14 productive young undocumented immigrants brought here as children \u8212\'20\'14 would "fall in love" with the Republican Party.\par \par \uc2 It doesn't take the average overachieving DREAMer's common sense to recognize that the loaded gun in Trump's hand is not pointed at the Democrats.\par \par \uc2 Trump's proposed wall, the wedge issue he used successfully to appeal to the worst anti-immigrant instincts in his most loyal voters, would be an ecological, economic and diplomatic disaster. But of perhaps more immediate concern is that it would cost multiple billions of dollars we don't have available to waste. And that even Trump's most gullible voters have figured out by now that Mexico won't pay for the wall.\par \par \uc2 DACA's end is due in March if Congress doesn't act. That leaves 800,000 DREAMers in an inhumanely precarious position. If Trump wants to play chicken with these people's lives and livelihoods, he should consider what hangs in the balance and who's really at risk.\par \par \uc2 DACA immigrants do our economy a lot more good than harm. They earn almost $20 billion a year and pay more than $3 billion in taxes.\par \par \uc2 Trump's huge tax cut, his lone legislative victory, comes at an estimated cost of $1.5 trillion. He needs the DREAMers and their earnings. Democrat, Republican or otherwise, we all do.\par \par \uc2 He also needs to rethink his position on what he calls "chain migration." The terminology is basically hater-spin on how we all got to this country \u8212\'20\'14 once upon a time, which can be as recently as last year or as long ago as 20,000 years via the Bering Strait, our industrious ancestors immigrated here and sent for the rest of the family as soon as they could manage it. Trump owes his own citizenship and silver-spoon privilege to so-called "chain migration."\par \par \uc2 Demonizing family immigration as "chain migration" is a political ploy for fanning fears of terrorism. But eventually it will occur to even his most committed anti-immigrant supporters, even if they claim Mayflower lineage, that they still have some relatives in the old country they'd like to sponsor. The rest of the country already have figured out that they are pro-immigrant, according to polls.\par \par \uc2 Trump keeps talking about wanting to let in only productive people who can help us. He can't do that by killing one of their main incentives. No one with any gumption would want to come here if it meant leaving behind his or her entire family for good.\par \par \uc2 The bottom line is that immigration is good for the economy and the gene pool and hindering immigration is bad for both. The right, smart thing for a president to do would be to urge Democrats and Republicans to deliver DACA legislation pronto, treat the wall as a separate issue, abandon "chain migration" hate rhetoric and stop playing with that loaded gun.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 The Dallas Morning News. Jan. 2, 2018.\par \par \uc2 The term "fake news," already embedded in the national psyche of this country, achieved global recognition when the UK-based Collins Dictionary declared it the Word of the Year for 2017, citing its "ubiquitous presence."\par \par \uc2 The masquerading of fake news as real, and assaults on real news as fake, threatens our democratic institutions, including that of a free press. This compounds problems abroad and creates tensions worldwide.\par \par \uc2 Collins defines the term as "false, often sensational, information disseminated under the guise of news reporting." President \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  uses it as a rhetorical device to discount an unfavorable story or distrusted news outlet or diminish the media at large.\par \par \uc2 Others are following his lead: Trump surrogates, members of Congress, autocrats and dictators elsewhere now alleging fake news treatment, and political analysts who argue that unverified information that is "out there" gives them license to repeat it as fact.\par \par \uc2 Fake news comes in different forms, ranging from total fabrication to distortion of facts to state-sponsored propaganda to the spread of erroneous content on social media such as \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Trump repeatedly turns to \uc2 Twitter\uc2  to discredit the news media, tweeting about fake news 141 times from January through October, according to Fox News' \uc2 Chris Wallace\uc2 . Americans disturbingly are buying in. A politico poll recently found that 46 percent of voters actually believe major news organizations make up stories about Trump.\par \par \uc2 This is troubling in the journalism universe. At least most major news organizations admit their mistakes. Still, we clearly we need to do more to regain reader trust.\par \par \uc2 But readers and viewers also should find the spread of fake news troubling. Which brings us to another intriguing Word of the Year. \uc2 Dictionary.com\uc2  selected "complicit," noting the word's new relevance in politics and social commentary.\par \par \uc2 Dictionary.com\uc2  says complicit means "choosing to be involved in an illegal or questionable act, especially with others; having partnership or involvement in wrongdoing." Put simply, it means being, at some level, responsible for something . . . even if indirectly.\par \par \uc2 Interest in the word spiked during 2017, including after Republican \uc2 U.S. Sen. Jeff Flake\uc2  of Arizona announced his retirement, saying, "I will not be complicit or silent" about the current political climate and the tone of Trump's presidency. It emerged in conversations about alleged sexual misconduct by Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein and whether others knew of the behavior but failed to stop it.\par \par \uc2 The connection between "complicit" and "fake news" is easily made. Americans have become complicit in accepting and sharing fake news. We all need to be smarter in recognizing deception.\par \par \uc2 Some advice: Don't trust everything a friend shares with you online. Be your own fact-checker. Share only stories you know to be true. Call out "friends" who send you unverified rubbish. Be willing to pay for journalism you trust.\par \par \uc2 Our nation needs discerning readers and viewers \u8212\'20\'14 those who welcome honest journalism that holds leaders accountable and provides vital information for citizens to cast informed votes and contribute to decision-making.\par \par \uc2 Nothing less than our democracy depends on it.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 Beaumont Enterprise. Jan. 2, 2018.\par \par \uc2 Plans for a "bullet train" to run between Houston and Dallas took a step forward recently, and the venture should be given every chance to succeed. But its backers should hold to a promise not to seek state or federal aid for the project.\par \par \uc2 Although proposals like this can seem intriguing, they face many financial and environmental barriers. If this train can surmount them, fine. Its developers have said they might seek federally supported loans available to other private companies, and that's acceptable.\par \par \uc2 But taxpayers should not be forced to subsidize an experimental project like this if developers get midway through and realize it's not viable.\par \par \uc2 Or if it does get up and running, tax dollars should not be required to keep it open if private sales turn out to be insufficient.\par \par \uc2 This $12 billion project by Texas Central is envisioned as a 90-minute, 200-mph alternative to a longer highway drive or even airline flight.\par \par \uc2 The Federal Railroad Administration\uc2  removed one bureaucratic obstacle when it released a draft environmental impact statement that identifies a preferred route as well as possible station locations.\par \par \uc2 That begins a public comment period that runs through late February. Texas Central and the FRA will consider those comments when planning a final statement.\par \par \uc2 Bullet train backers like to point out how this mode of transportation succeeds in Japan and Europe. That's encouraging, but the United States is different. Automobile travel is much more common here, and many Americans have never been on a passenger train. There is also not much reason to believe they yearn for the experience.\par \par \uc2 Maybe this experiment will prove to be different. Texans would undoubtedly welcome an alternative way to get between our two largest cities if the train delivers as promised.\par \par \uc2 But if it turns out to be another financial albatross, its private-sector backers must absorb the loss.\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020180103ee1300hd3\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 NEW YORK (AP) \u8212\'20\'14 Amanda Morales sees her children off to school each day from the entrance of a gothic church, but she won't even venture onto the sidewalk for fear of what may happen if she leaves the building where she has been a virtual prisoner for more than two months.\par \par \uc2 Morales has been living in two small rooms of the Holyrood Episcopal Church at the northern edge of Manhattan since August, shortly after immigration authorities ordered her deported to her homeland of Guatemala. She says she cannot go back to her country and does not want to leave her three kids, who are all U.S. citizens by birth, so she sought sanctuary at a house of worship.\par \par \uc2 "Being cooped up like this is starting to drive me crazy," the 33-year-old said on a recent morning as her two oldest children headed off to school escorted by a volunteer and she stayed behind with her youngest. "Some nights I hardly sleep."\par \par \uc2 At least two dozen immigrants have sought sanctuary at U.S. churches since the \uc2 Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2  agency stepped up arrests by 40 percent under President \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 . Morales provided a glimpse of her experience to The Associated Press, describing a life of constant anxiety that involves staying hidden all day, except for a few furtive trips to a nearby dentist and occasional appearances on the church steps.\par \par \uc2 She has reason to be anxious. As a fugitive, she could be arrested at any moment, though the agency considers churches to be "sensitive locations" and generally does not pursue people inside.\par \par \uc2 Morales stays close to the doorway as her kids head off to school, holding her toddler son's bottle as he plays in the wooden pews. It is the only glimpse of sunlight she will get all day.\par \par \uc2 Most of her life revolves around a small church library where there are two bunk beds for the family of four to share and an adjacent room with a refrigerator, small table, a few chairs and a microwave oven. They eat simple meals, a lot of macaroni and cheese or chicharron and yuca.\par \par \uc2 The stately church is empty on a weekday morning. Morales spends much of the day chatting with parishioners who come from the mostly Latino neighborhood. Three days a week, while her daughters are at school, volunteers give her English language classes while 2-year-old David watches cartoons on her phone. The older girls \u8212\'20\'14 10-year-old Dulce and 8-year-old Daniela \u8212\'20\'14 come back in the afternoon with their escort, and the family tries their best to pass the time inside.\par \par \uc2 "I never thought this would happen to me," Morales said at one point, shaking her head sadly.\par \par \uc2 Since 2014, at least 50 publicly known cases have emerged of people seeking sanctuary in churches for immigration-related reasons, according to Rev. Noel Anderson, a coordinator for the Church World Service, a New York organization that supports the sanctuary efforts. Of those, 30 have come up since Trump took office in January and pledged a harder line on immigration.\par \par \uc2 Eighteen of the 50 eventually won legal reprieves, and their deportation orders were canceled. More than half are still waiting in limbo like Morales and fearing that they could be picked up suddenly, just as several immigrants in Virginia were when they got arrested in February while leaving a homeless shelter at a Methodist church.\par \par \uc2 It was hardly a surprise that Morales would turn to a religious organization for help. Back in her small Guatemalan hometown, the local Catholic church was one of the largest buildings and the center of community life. She grew up not far from the border with Mexico, in a landscape known for Mayan ruins scattered through the deep green forest. But while aesthetically beautiful, the area was desperately poor, with few jobs.\par \par \uc2 Like many Guatemalans, she turned north to raise money to send back to her family. She was detained crossing the U.S.-Mexico border in Texas in 2004 and released with an order to appear before an immigration judge, who issued a removal, or deportation, order four months later.\par \par \uc2 Morales stayed in the U.S., living first in Maryland with a sister who died in an accident in 2006 and then on Long Island, New York, in a neighborhood that has filled in recent years with Central Americans fleeing the poverty and gang violence of their home countries. She worked at a dry cleaner, among other under-the-table jobs, and had her children with a father who she would not discuss.\par \par \uc2 In 2012, she was in a car accident, and immigration authorities re-discovered her. She checked in regularly as required while she sought some way to stay in the U.S. This past summer, she came to her appointment and was told to come back with a one-way ticket to Guatemala. At that point, she fled to the church with the help of a New Sanctuary Coalition, an interfaith group that helps immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Trump has said that anyone in the United States illegally is subject to deportation, unlike under President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 , who said immigrants with long-standing ties to the United States and clean records were not a priority. More than 97,000 immigrants who live illegally in the U.S. were detained over the first eight months of this year, a 43 percent increase over the same period in 2016, according to ICE data.\par \par \uc2 Morales is afraid of being part of those statistics so she tries to stay calm and upbeat for David, who hardly leaves her side and plays in her lap, pulling her long curly dark hair, kissing her and tickling her ears, laughing. She says taking the kids back to Guatemala is out of the question.\par \par \uc2 "It would be taking the future away from my kids if they go to Guatemala," she said.\par \par \uc2 While Dulce and Daniela attend an after-school program at the church, Morales puts David down for a nap and watches Spanish-language TV at low volume. Throughout the day she often looks at the photos and videos on her phone of her kids' birthday pi\u241\'00\'F1ata parties in her Long Island yard and talks with excitement about her big family and the most recent job she had at an instrument strings factory.\par \par \uc2 The church pastor, the Rev. Luis Barrios, said she will be there as long as needed, which for some immigrants in church sanctuary has meant a few days, weeks or many months, usually until the government grants a temporary stay of the deportation.\par \par \uc2 On a recent evening, the girls and David sat on the floor and tried to put together a toy volcano. Morales complained because Daniela ate only a hard-boiled egg and some mango for dinner. The girls did some homework and read in bed.\par \par \uc2 "I tell myself," Morales said, "this is going to end one day."\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 Associated Press Writer Philip Marcelo contributed to this report from Boston.\par \par \uc2 In this Oct. 26, 2017 photo, Amanda Morales, 33, poses for a photograph in the sanctuary of the Holyrood Episcopal Church, the Bronx borough of New York.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 ATLANTA (AP) \u8212\'20\'14 A Mexican woman whose case grabbed national headlines when she was a Georgia college student seven years ago could lose her protection from deportation for a second time this year.\par \par \uc2 Immigration authorities re-evaluated 29-year-old Jessica Colotl's protection under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and decided not to renew it, federal government lawyers wrote in a court filing Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 The DACA program, which was created by the Obama administration in 2012, offers a reprieve from deportation to people in the country illegally who can prove they arrived before they were 16, have been in the U.S. for several years and have not committed a crime since arriving. It also allows them to work legally.\par \par \uc2 President \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  last month announced an end to the program. But he said those whose authorizations were set to expire within six months could apply for renewals as long as they did so by Oct. 5.\par \par \uc2 The government previously revoked Colotl's DACA status in May, and a government lawyer the next day filed a new request for a deportation order, citing the termination of her DACA status.\par \par \uc2 Her lawyers argued at the time that the government terminated her protected status illegally \u8212\'20\'14 without notice, without due process and without a reasoned explanation. They filed a challenge in federal court in Atlanta.\par \par \uc2 U.S. District Judge Mark Cohen in June wrote that it appeared the government had failed to follow its own procedures when it revoked Colotl's DACA status and declined her application for renewal.\par \par \uc2 He instructed federal authorities to reconsider the termination of Colotl's DACA status and her application for renewal. He ordered that her protected status, including authorization to work in the U.S., be restored while that reconsideration was pending.\par \par \uc2 Cohen said his order would remain in place until he is satisfied that the government has "followed all relevant standard operating procedures" regarding the processing of Colotl's renewal application and any termination of her DACA status.\par \par \uc2 Immigration authorities reinstated her status and reopened her renewal application, Wednesday's court filing says. They provided her with a notice of intent to deny her renewal request on Aug. 18 and considered her response before deciding Monday to deny her request, the filing says.\par \par \uc2 The government has therefore addressed the concerns raised by Colotl's lawyers about the May termination of her protected status and followed the proper procedure, so the case should be dismissed, government lawyers argue.\par \par \uc2 Charles Kuck, a lawyer for Colotl, said the government still has not given a valid reason for denying her the protected status, that the program was designed precisely for people like her.\par \par \uc2 "We're very disappointed that the immigration service continues to play with this young woman's life," Kuck said by phone Wednesday. "We will once again see them in court over this."\par \par \uc2 Colotl, now 29, was brought to the U.S. illegally by her parents when she was 11. She became a flashpoint in the national debate over immigration reform in 2010 after she was pulled over on a traffic charge on the campus of \uc2 Kennesaw State University\uc2 , near Atlanta. She was arrested and turned over to federal immigration authorities who kept her in a detention center for 37 days.\par \par \uc2 Her case drew national attention after her sorority sisters held posters with her name on them during a march for immigration reform in Atlanta while she was detained.\par \par \uc2 She has since graduated from college and first applied for DACA in 2012. Her application was granted in 2013 and was renewed. She has been working as a paralegal in Kuck's firm and has said she wants to go to law school and to become an immigration lawyer.\par \par \uc2 FILE - In this April 28, 2011 file photo, Jessica Colotl, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  and student at Kennesaw State University, speaks during a media interview at her lawyer's office in Atlanta. Federal immigration authorities have for the second time this year revoked the protection from deportation granted to Colotl. Federal government lawyers said in a court filing Wednesday, Oct. 25, 2017, that the government had re-evaluated Colotl's protection under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and decided not to renew it.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) \u8212\'20\'14 President \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 's long list of immigration demands has landed with a thud among lawmakers hopeful for a deal to protect hundreds of thousands of young immigrants from deportation.\par \par \uc2 The list of demands released late Sunday includes funding for a southern border wall and a crackdown on so-called sanctuary cities \u8212\'20\'14 items that are cheered by the president's most loyal supporters, but are non-starters among Democrats and could divide Republicans, who will have to come together on any deal.\par \par \uc2 The demands have left pro-immigration activists alarmed. And some are scratching their heads, given that the president appeared to sign off on a more palatable deal with Democrats just weeks ago.\par \par \uc2 "To stall the progress that Democrats and Republicans have been fostering in giving permanent relief to more than 800,000 DREAMers is sabotage," said U.S. Rep. Ra\u250\'00\'FAl Grijalva, an Arizona Democrat and frequent Trump critic.\par \par \uc2 House and Senate leaders on both sides of the aisle have said they want to find a legislative solution to extend protections first granted under former President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA. Trump announced last month that he was phasing out DACA, but gave Congress six months to act before recipients' work permits begin to expire.\par \par \uc2 Trump suggested at the time that he was eager for a deal, telling reporters, "I have a love for these people and hopefully now Congress will be able to help them and do it properly."\par \par \uc2 Days later, he appeared to reach the broad outlines of an agreement with the House and Senate's top Democrats, \uc2 Nancy Pelosi\uc2  and \uc2 Chuck Schumer\uc2 , in which the president would be open to extended DACA protections in exchange for a package of border security measures.\par \par \uc2 While Trump made clear that he still expected funding for his border wall, he said repeatedly that the funding could come later, in separate legislation.\par \par \uc2 In a joint statement Sunday night, Pelosi and Schumer said Trump could not "be serious about" the plan the White House had unveiled, which includes not only the wall, but dozens of other controversial measures, including a crackdown on unaccompanied immigrant minors and a complete overhaul of the legal immigration system.\par \par \uc2 Some of those who hope to see DACA protections extended said they remain optimistic the president will show flexibility, treating the priorities as a policy wish-list and starting point for negotiation.\par \par \uc2 Others see the demands as part of a plot orchestrated by Trump's chief policy adviser, \uc2 Stephen Miller\uc2 , an immigration hardliner, to derail any chance of a DACA deal.\par \par \uc2 "I don't think President Trump wants to be the president who deports 700,000 young people," said Ali Noorani, executive director of the National Immigration Forum, who described the list as a "big torpedo" to bipartisan negotiations already under way.\par \par \uc2 "I think the president's staff have led him into a corner," Noorani said, predicting the president would "not be happy when he realizes it."\par \par \uc2 But one person familiar with the president's thinking said the list was intended to make clear that Trump is no longer interested in forging a DACA deal, the same message sent by a White House official's insistence Sunday that any path to citizenship for DACA recipients was off the table.\par \par \uc2 After backing an establishment Senate candidate who lost by 10 points in an Alabama special election last month, the president is working to please his base supporters, signing a new religious liberty executive order and broadcasting his intention to decertify the Iran nuclear deal.\par \par \uc2 "The president has made clear he wants Congress to act and pass responsible immigration reform in conjunction with any legislation related to DACA, which will include legal authorities to close border security loopholes, restoring interior enforcement, and reforming the legal immigration system," said White House spokeswoman Kelly Love.\par \par \uc2 Presidential counselor Kellyanne Conway told Fox News the president was "open to a deal" on DACA but only "along with all these other critical functions."\par \par \uc2 "You know for years, this country, including Capitol Hill and the swamp, they've always asked: what more can we do for the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , what's fair to the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 ? This president is asking: what's fair to America? What's fair to the American worker? What's fair to the American community?" she said.\par \par \uc2 Both Democrats and Republicans have pointed to a hoped-for year-end package of spending bills as the likely vehicle to tackle immigration issues, including any potential DACA deal.\par \par \uc2 Democratic votes will be required to enact the year-end measure, but many Democrats have said they won't support any legislation that doesn't address DACA recipients, raising the possibility of a government shutdown just before Christmas.\par \par \uc2 Controversy over border wall funding already meant the year-end package would be difficult. But one potential opening is that the White House has been willing in the past to accept border fencing and other security steps that fall short of Trump's vision for a wall along the entire length of the border.\par \par \uc2 Either way, Trump's zig-zagging seemed likely to erode the trust that will likely be required to seal any agreement.\par \par \uc2 Rep. Luis Guti\u233\'00\'E9rrez, D-Ill., said that, after Sunday, the president should not be considered a reliable negotiating partner. "Any decision the president makes one day is likely to be completely reversed another, depending on which extremist adviser he is listening to that day," he said.\par \par \uc2 Still others, including \uc2 Sen. David Perdue\uc2 , R-Ga., applauded the measures, calling the president "spot on."\par \par \uc2 House Freedom Caucus chairman \uc2 Mark Meadows\uc2  said: "We look forward to the administration's insistence on these principles in any deal that is signed into law. "\par \par \uc2 In this Oct. 7, 2017, photo, President Donald Trump speaks to reporters before leaving the White House in Washington for a brief stop at Andrews Air Force Base in Md., on his way to Greensboro, N.C. The Trump administration sent an immigration policy wish-list to Congress that includes overhauling the country's green-card system, hiring 10,000 more immigration officers and building a wall along the southern border.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 PITTSBURGH (AP) \u8212\'20\'14 He is long past retirement as one of his generation's most renowned cantors, a living link to Eastern European Jewish culture before it was devastated in the Holocaust that claimed much of his family.\par \par \uc2 Yet Moshe Taube still can fill a living room or a synagogue or a concert hall with his rich, fluid, reverberating voice, conveying a sense of trembling before the divine.\par \par \uc2 He sings when invited to chant Sabbath prayers at area Orthodox synagogues, or heart-piercing songs of lament at Holocaust remembrance services. In more relaxed settings, he sings classics that that may not be explicitly religious but are poignantly aspirational in their own way, such as "Nessun Dorma" by Puccini or "You'll Never Walk Alone" by Rodgers and Hammerstein.\par \par \uc2 "I am thankful to the Almighty that at my age I still have my voice," said Rev. Taube, whose title reflects a cantor's status as a member of the clergy.\par \par \uc2 He spoke in an interview at his Squirrel Hill home, where he sat wearing a casual shirt and simple skullcap.\par \par \uc2 At his home, he is surrounded by emblems of his life. There is the upright piano where he still accompanies himself on vocal exercises every day. ("There's an English expression: If you don't use it, you lose it," he said.)\par \par \uc2 On one bookshelf stand bound volumes of the Talmud; on another are boxed CDs of operas by the likes of Berlioz, Donizetti and Mussorgsky.\par \par \uc2 There are photos of his family, which now extends to 11 grandchildren and 18 great-grandchildren.\par \par \uc2 One photo shows Moshe Taube as a young teen \u8212\'20\'14 around the time of his bar mitzvah in Poland \u8212\'20\'14 with his mother and sister. The formality of that black-and-white studio portrait stands in contrast to the imminent catastrophe, as both women perished soon afterward in the Holocaust.\par \par \uc2 A later photo is emblematic of how Rev. Taube and his father survived. It's a color snapshot showing Rev. Taube and his wife, Helena, with Emilie Schindler during her visit to Pittsburgh in 1994.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. Schindler, along with her husband, German industrialist Oskar Schindler, helped save the lives of Moshe Taube, his father and more than 1,000 other Jews during the Holocaust, a heroic feat memorialized in the 1993 movie "Schindler's List."\par \par \uc2 These events are on Rev. Taube's mind constantly, three-quarters of a century later.\par \par \uc2 Moshe Taube, 90, spends much of his time studying histories of World War II and the Holocaust.\par \par \uc2 "I can never read enough of it," he said. "I still am at a loss at how it all happened. How was it possible such misfortune, such tragedy should befall my family and my fellow Jews?"\par \par \uc2 For Rev. Taube, a music scholar who finds transcendent meaning in song, including the great works of German composers, the questions are particularly acute.\par \par \uc2 "Music is life. Music is life!" he repeated. "Without music there is no life. And they gave life to the world with Brahms and Beethoven and Schumann and Schubert. These people, I know them through their music. I know their humanity and humaneness through these composers."\par \par \uc2 He questioned "how a nation who gave birth to these people should descend into the hell of hatred, of bestiality. I'm trying to read about it. I'm trying to find out from different people, from different sources. How is it possible?"\par \par \uc2 He searches memory as well as books for answers.\par \par \uc2 "All I remember was a blind following, a blind faith, in a maniac. A maniac!" he said, referring to Adolf Hitler.\par \par \uc2 The Nazis and his followers, he said, were "very receptive, to a brainwash, unfortunately. And that brainwash made them accomplices to the tremendous crime. It's not a crime. It's bestiality. They deprived my family of the right to live."\par \par \uc2 He added: "Whoever was not blind was afraid not to be blind."\par \par \uc2 In fact, Rev. Taube has been meditating on both extremes of the human condition, not just its evil depths but its sublime heights.\par \par \uc2 He spends much of his time listening to music, whether in person or on CD recordings, marveling what the great composers have birthed.\par \par \uc2 "Without divine inspiration, they wouldn't be able to produce such music," he said. "This is my conviction."\par \par \uc2 Moshe Taube was born in June 1927 in Krakow, Poland, to music-loving parents whose home was often filled with the sounds of opera and folk tunes. By age 8, he was singing and studying music in the choir of a legendary cantor, Yossele Mandelbaum, who sang so emotively that Rev. Taube still recalls the sobs his singing elicited from the congregation.\par \par \uc2 He said the music "became a part of me even as a child." He hoped to become like his mentor.\par \par \uc2 But soon after the German invasion of Poland in 1939, the Nazis rounded him up with his family and other Jews in Krakow's ghetto. In 1942, the Nazis shipped them to concentration camps. He and his father were assigned to a labor camp, separated from his mother and sister, who were sent to their deaths. Dozens in his extended family also were murdered, he said.\par \par \uc2 "I could not sing between 1939 and 1945," Rev. Taube said. "I couldn't sing because of the atrocities that happened. Singing is an expression of fulfillment, happiness, of worship. I did worship, but not with singing."\par \par \uc2 From the Plaszow labor camp, his father managed to get the two of them on Oskar Schindler's workforce in a munitions factory in Brunnlitz until the end of the war.\par \par \uc2 While avoiding the death camps, the workers were still desperately eating grass to survive by the end of the war, Rev. Taube said. He's still grateful to the Russian soldiers who shared their meager rations with them when they liberated them.\par \par \uc2 "We were mortally starved. Bread was lifesaving, like gold, more than gold," he said. "And they shared their bread."\par \par \uc2 Later in 1945, when he went to live with a surviving relative in Romania, the music returned.\par \par \uc2 He still remembers how someone was playing a gramophone that sat on a floor. It was Intermezzo of the opera "Cavalleria Rusticana" by Pietro Mascagni.\par \par \uc2 "It was the first classical selection I heard after six years of nothing," he said. "It drew me to such a point, people were looking at me. I was on my knees listening to it. I felt like I ate a wonderful meal."\par \par \uc2 And he recovered his voice.\par \par \uc2 "It sang out of me," he said. "My voice was singing out of me without my even wanting. I sang because I felt an urge to sing."\par \par \uc2 Soon he was on the move again, this time toward British-ruled Palestine. He emphasized that he made his way as an "\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 " and was interned by the British for a time before gaining freedom. In the early years of the state of Israel, once people began to hear his powerful tenor voice, he was recruited regularly to chant at synagogues. In 1957, he came to America to further his music education at the Juilliard School in New York City.\par \par \uc2 After several years as a cantor in New York, he accepted an offer from Congregation Beth Shalom in Squirrel Hill in 1965, where he remained as cantor for more than 40 years. In addition to singing, he became a prolific composer of Jewish liturgical music.\par \par \uc2 He maintained strong ties to Israel, where his grandchildren and great-grandchildren live and where his brother, Arie, fought and died in the 1973 Yom Kippur War.\par \par \uc2 Rabbi Seth Adelson, the current rabbi at Beth Shalom, arrived here years after Rev. Taube's retirement. But he was well aware of the latter's reputation, and hearing him in person "has been a real thrill for me," he said. Rabbi Adelson, who also trained as a cantor, said Rev. Taube's work was part of the curriculum when he studied at Jewish Theological Seminary in New York City.\par \par \uc2 "He is one of the most prominent cantors in the world," Rabbi Adelson said. "His is a voice of the Old World. He definitely brought what he learned in Europe before the war and created a wonderful body of work."\par \par \uc2 Julian Elbling, a past president of Beth Shalom, said Rev. Taube was long at the spiritual heart of the congregation, inspiring it particularly when it recovered from a devastating fire.\par \par \uc2 "When he sings, you would think he had a great connection to the up above," he said.\par \par \uc2 Even today, Rev. Taube finds his heart lifted by music in the way he did in his Krakow synagogue.\par \par \uc2 He recounted the performance of Gustav Mahler's "Resurrection" symphony earlier this year by the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra and the Mendelssohn Choir of Pittsburgh.\par \par \uc2 "People went wild after hearing this symphony," he said. "The people were yelling, shouting. I was yelling like everybody else. This was a life experience."\par \par \uc2 As much as Rev. Taube wrestles with the great questions, he said he has never demanded answers to the question that vexes so many others \u8212\'20\'14 where God was during the Holocaust.\par \par \uc2 "I had abiding faith that whatever God has decreed this was the destiny that we couldn't change," he said. "And we might not understand his ways and his thoughts because we are humans. So therefore I cannot ask God to be human and say, 'What did you do?' He is above humanity. He is the creator of humanity. There are some things we as humans cannot understand because our understanding is limited. Our thoughts are limited.\par \par \uc2 "Therefore I did not question. I complained. I complained bitterly, but to question 'What did you do, God?' this is not something I felt is proper."\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 Online:\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://bit.ly/2vqQiMo"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://bit.ly/2vqQiMo}}}\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 Information from: Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.post-gazette.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.post-gazette.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Cantor Moshe Taube poses for a portrait at his home in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill neighborhood on Friday, July 14, 2017.

One of them has the largest petroleum reserves in the world. It is Venezuela.\par \par \uc2 Months of demonstrations in the streets have left nearly 100 Venezuelans dead and at least 1,500 wounded. The country's corrupt socialist government, headed by Nicolas Maduro, has been unmoved by the unrest, the suffering of its people and even a referendum last week in which millions of people demonstrated their dissatisfaction with the regime.\par \par \uc2 Within a few days, Venezuela will hold an election meant to name a new constituent assembly that is to rewrite the nation's constitution. Whether it is conducted honestly, which is highly doubtful, and whether the government bows to the will of the people will be important.\par \par \uc2 For months, few world leaders have shown any desire to intervene in Venezuela's internal affairs. But last week, that began to change. Canada, Mexico, Brazil and the \uc2 European Union\uc2  have expressed concern about the upcoming vote.\par \par \uc2 President \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  issued a statement proclaiming that, "The United States will not stand by as Venezuela crumbles." He vowed "strong and swift economic actions" if the Maduro regime installs a puppet assembly.\par \par \uc2 If that is done, care must be exercised to avoid hurting the very Venezuelan people Trump wants to help. And under no circumstance should the United States intervene directly against Maduro's government.\par \par \uc2 Clearly, however, neither our government nor others can continue to ignore what is going on in Venezuela, where enormous suffering is being caused by an autocratic regime that is not supported by the people of that country.\par \par \uc2 Online: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://bit.ly/2v5eia6"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://bit.ly/2v5eia6}}}\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 MAINE\par \par \uc2 The Times Record (\uc2 Brunswick\uc2 )\par \par \uc2 July 28\par \par \uc2 Some in the Legislature will attempt on Aug. 2 to resurrect a bill making female genital mutilation a state crime.\par \par \uc2 Known as FGM or the misnomer "female circumcision," the practice involves the cutting or removal of some or all of the external genitalia. In some instances, FGM involves blocking or narrowing the vaginal opening. The \uc2 World Health Organization\uc2  states that practice, "aims to ensure premarital virginity and marital fidelity."\par \par \uc2 "Though no religious scripts prescribe the practice, practitioners often believe the practice has religious support," WHO states.\par \par \uc2 Rather than curbing sexual desire, FGM can make sex extremely painful. Moreover, it can lead to serious health risks, including infection, urinary and vaginal problems and, in some cases, death.\par \par \uc2 According to a report by the United Nations Children's Fund, at least 200 million girls and women in 30 countries alive today have undergone the practice, mostly in Africa and the Middle East. According to \uc2 UNICEF\uc2 , the practice is prevalent in Sudan and Somalia, both of which have immigrant populations in Maine.\par \par \uc2 An Act To Prohibit Female Genital Mutilation would make it a crime to perform FGM on girls, or to be a parent or guardian who permits it. It also prohibits transporting a girl from the state for the purpose of FGM. Punishment is up to 10 years incarceration and a $20,000 fine.\par \par \uc2 FGM is already prohibited under federal law, but supporters believe the bill allows state prosecutors to go after perpetrators of a horrific crime that federal prosecutors in Maine are too overwhelmed to handle.\par \par \uc2 The bill's sponsor, Rep. Heather Sirocki, tells us that FGM is "often done without anastasia and with physical restraint."\par \par \uc2 With all that in mind, who could possibly be opposed to the bill?\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 ACLU\uc2  of Maine, for one, which would rather "find evidence-based solutions that will truly protect these vulnerable populations."\par \par \uc2 And it seems that hard evidence of FGM is difficult to find. Sirocki says there are no documented cases of FGM in Maine, although she and other advocates say they have solid reasons to believe it is happening.\par \par \uc2 "The evidence is somewhat difficult to pin down," Sirocki said. "People are engaging in it, but you have to catch them and have someone report it. . At the same time, I'm getting private \uc2 Facebook\uc2  messages from nurses working in obstetrics and they are reporting horrific mutilations."\par \par \uc2 Sirocki is also convinced that Somali immigrants in Lewiston have carried the practice over, noting that in Somalia, FGM is prevalent in 98 percent of women and girls, figures backed up by \uc2 UNICEF\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 We asked Rep. Sirocki if it would make more sense to put efforts into quantifying hard data in order to address the issue.\par \par \uc2 "I don't know how to penetrate this community and get that information," Sirocki said, adding that, even if bill could be construed as unnecessary, "what is the harm in having an unnecessary law?"\par \par \uc2 We should note that the community to which she refers is 47 miles from her own legislative district in Scarborough.\par \par \uc2 "This is sending a message to a community that says, 'We do not allow that here,'" Sirocki. "There is no harm in having this law on the books."\par \par \uc2 ACLU\uc2 , however, does believe the law would cause harm, as they believe it is an "attempt to single out behavior that is commonly attributed to certain religious and ethnic communities as different from other forms of abuse."\par \par \uc2 ACLU\uc2  would also prefer "results based solutions that prioritize education and prevention over criminalization are the most effective way to curb dangerous behaviors."\par \par \uc2 There is no question that FGM is a horrific practice with no benefits and lasting physical and psychological harm. All sides agree on that. And Sirocki is correct when she says that FGM is a cultural, not a religious, problem and a form of child abuse.\par \par \uc2 If FGM is happening in Maine, as Sirocki fears, it needs to be combated, and that begins when people report instances in a quantifiable way.\par \par \uc2 It's easier for the Legislature to further criminalize FGM, but harder to provide preventative measures \u8212\'20\'14 outreach and education.\par \par \uc2 Without hard data as to how often, if at all, FGM occurs in Maine, Sirocki's bill still seems like a solution in search of a problem.\par \par \uc2 Online: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://bit.ly/2v6ZZ4G"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://bit.ly/2v6ZZ4G}}}\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 VERMONT\par \par \uc2 The Brattleboro Reformer\par \par \uc2 July 27\par \par \uc2 The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court's decision Monday curtailing overreach by federal immigration officers was the obvious one for the justices to make. That doesn't make it any less important in ways that could extend beyond Massachusetts.\par \par \uc2 The SJC ruled unanimously that state law does not permit local and state officials to detain immigrants at the request of federal immigration officers. This puts a roadblock before the Trump administration's efforts to essentially deputize state officials to participate in the White House's increasingly aggressive policy of arresting and detaining immigrants.\par \par \uc2 The court case originated with the arrest of Sreynuon Lunn, a Cambodian immigrant who was arrested last year on charges of unarmed robbery in Boston. The charges were dropped, but a Boston Municipal Court judge kept him in custody at the request of \uc2 Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) \uc2 until its agents could arrive and arrest him on charges of being an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . Mr. Lunn was ordered deported in the early 2000s after a criminal conviction but Cambodia would not accept him. According to \uc2 the American Civil Liberties Union\uc2 , Mr. Lunn, who arrived in Massachusetts as a seven-month-old in 1985, has subsequently been released.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 U.S. Justice Department\uc2  argued that Massachusetts officials have the "inherent authority" to detain people solely at the request of ICE. In an unsigned opinion, the SJC countered that "Massachusetts law provides no authority for Massachusetts court officers to arrest and hold an individual solely on the basis of a federal civil immigration detainer."\par \par \uc2 Immigration law and enforcement falls within federal oversight, an authority that agencies like ICE guard jealously until it is convenient to do otherwise. State and local law enforcement officials argued that being brought into immigration cases by ICE makes it difficult for them to gain and keep the confidence of understandably jittery immigrant communities. This in turn compromises their ability to address legitimate criminal acts within those communities.\par \par \uc2 These concerns helped prompt Great Barrington to adopt its "Trust Policy" at its May Town Meeting defining the rights of immigrants in the town, and led the Pittsfield and Stockbridge police departments to adopt policies declaring that the enforcement of immigration policy is not their responsibility. A Safe Communities Act embedding these principles in state law is currently before the Legislature.\par \par \uc2 The SJC in its decision went a step further to declare that if the federal government went beyond requests for cooperation from local and state officials to make such cooperation mandatory it would be in violation of the 10th amendment. That amendment states that any powers not delegated to the federal government by the U.S. Constitution are reserved to the states.\par \par \uc2 The ruling will not hinder the federal government in enforcing its immigration policy, even if misguided, but it will prevent local and state officials have being undermined or dragged into transparent fishing expeditions as was the case with Mr. Lunn. The SJC has in the past opened a trail with its rulings, perhaps most notably in its decision supporting gay marriage, and it is safe to say that its decision rendered Monday will be of keen interest to other states concerned about federal overreach on immigration.\par \par \uc2 Online: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://bit.ly/2tQxKrk"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://bit.ly/2tQxKrk}}}\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 CONNECTICUT\par \par \uc2 The Hartford Courant\par \par \uc2 July 26\par \par \uc2 Connecticut is a national outlier when it comes to determining state employee pension benefits. That's confirmed by a respected research organization, the \uc2 Pew Charitable Trusts\uc2 , in a recent report.\par \par \uc2 The way this state sets state retirement benefits leaves the legislature largely out of the conversation. The legislature should take up the think tank's recommendation to get more information from other states on their retirement benefits and policies.\par \par \uc2 There are just four states where collective bargaining plays a primary role in determining pension benefits, and Connecticut is one of them, says Pew.\par \par \uc2 Here, the governor and his budget chief do the talking for the state with the State Employees Bargaining Agent Coalition.\par \par \uc2 The vast majority of states do it differently, by statute \u8212\'20\'14 meaning that those benefits can be modified by legislatures.\par \par \uc2 The chief negotiators for most other states are legislative leaders, says Toni Boucher, Republican vice chairman of the legislature's Finance, Revenue & Bonding Committee. Why that matters is because governors are "not as responsive to what is happening at the grass roots."\par \par \uc2 Pew isn't suggesting that Connecticut state government eliminate collective bargaining or change the way it does business. It is suggesting that the legislature get caught up with the details of pension plans and policies in other states.\par \par \uc2 It's also suggesting the legislature more closely monitor the financial health of the state's retirement plans with a "stress test" that could help "determine how the plan would perform during a financial crisis."\par \par \uc2 Some may question whether it's too late for a state-by-state comparison. The state Senate is voting next week on a new benefits package negotiated between the governor's office and the State Employees Bargaining Agent Coalition. The state House of Representatives approved the benefits package this week. If the deal passes the Senate, it might be many years before retirement benefits come up for discussion again.\par \par \uc2 It's never too late to understand the impact of bargains, however.\par \par \uc2 If policymakers in decades past had really weighed the consequences of failing to fully fund retirement programs, Connecticut would not now have one of the worst-funded state employee pension plans in the nation.\par \par \uc2 Pew says its pension project team got requests from legislators from both sides of the political aisle for an analysis of the governor's deal with the State Employees Bargaining Agent Coalition. Pew said its analysis "does not constitute an endorsement of the agreement." But Pew does suggest, among other things, a 50-state study of retirement benefits "to help ensure Connecticut is in line with peer states." That's only sensible.\par \par \uc2 Pew said it and the state reached out to other states, asking them to "broadly generalize" how they determine pension benefits. They found that "collective bargaining does not determine state employee (pension) benefits in most states."\par \par \uc2 As a practical matter, states often do have to get union buy-in for changes in retirement benefits. But most other states handle retirement benefits like they do their budgets: by putting proposals through finance and appropriations committees to figure out how much the state can afford and where the money will come from.\par \par \uc2 In Connecticut, however, the legislature can't tweak the details of the deal that the governor and unions have reached. Legislators can only approve or reject it.\par \par \uc2 Or legislators don't have to vote at all: The deal is deemed automatically approved if no vote is taken for 30 days while the legislature is in regular session.\par \par \uc2 It might be healthy for the state Capitol to look at what other states do, given that Connecticut is the odd man out on this.\par \par \uc2 Online: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://cour.at/2tQzLnl"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://cour.at/2tQzLnl}}}\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 MASSACHUSETTS\par \par \uc2 The Gloucester Times\par \par \uc2 July 25\par \par \uc2 She's an old warship that gained fame \u8212\'20\'14 and the famous "Old Ironsides" nickname \u8212\'20\'14 more than 200 years ago. She last saw conflict many decades before the Civil War, yet sailors still walk her decks and proudly speak of her as the battle-tested warrior she is.\par \par \uc2 The USS Constitution was launched in 1797 and, like warships of that era, was meant to last for 10 or 20 years. Last Sunday, after more than two years in dry dock undergoing an extensive renovation, she floated again into Boston Harbor to tie up at her usual wharf in Charlestown.\par \par \uc2 This renovation was no small feat. Ship restorers and riggers painstakingly removed 100 rotted or damaged hull planks and gun deck sections, rebuilt the cutwater \u8212\'20\'14 the forward edge of the ship's bow \u8212\'20\'14 and the stern, and removed and replaced 2,200 copper sheets covering the hull below the water line. Five hundred of those copper sheets were signed by nearly 100,000 museum visitors before being hammered onto the hull.\par \par \uc2 If you visited during the renovation you would have seen a vessel shorn of its sails and rigging, with its dozens of cannons lined up on shore like beached pilot whales. All extra weight that could be removed was off the ship before she was pulled into dry dock in May 2015. For when the water was drained and the wooden ship left to balance on its keel, the extra weight of iron cannons and their carriages could have bowed and distended Old Ironsides' wooden hull.\par \par \uc2 Even under repair Old Ironsides was a big attraction. Active duty \uc2 U.S. Navy\uc2  sailors in their early 19th century garb were always ready to answer tourists' questions, and to occasionally demonstrate the speed and skill honed by the original ship's crew to load and reload the huge cannons they aimed against British warships in the War of 1812.\par \par \uc2 It was in the first major battle of that war that the Constitution earned her stripes and nickname.\par \par \uc2 Facing off against the British frigate HMS Guerriere \u8212\'20\'14 a French ship that had been seized and outfitted by the Brits \u8212\'20\'14 the Constitution pulled to within 25 yards and both ships opened fire. The resulting damage and chaos must have been tremendous, as the shredded sails and tangled rigging of the Guerriere brought down the main mast amid carnage on deck.\par \par \uc2 The brief battle disabled the British ship, which was later set ablaze and sunk. Seven Americans, including Lt. William Bush, the first U.S. Marine Corps officer to die in combat, were killed in the battle, along with 13 British sailors.\par \par \uc2 History says that a sailor aboard the Constitution, seeing the British cannon balls bouncing off her thick oak sides, cried out, "Huzza, her sides are made of iron!" Whether fact or just a good story, the name stuck.\par \par \uc2 Old Ironsides went on to win two other battles during that war, which was the extent of her combat.\par \par \uc2 She has undergone restorations many times. From 2007-10 she underwent work to return her closer to her appearance in 1812. This most recent work in dry dock, with a $12 million price tag, makes her shipshape for many years to come, especially since she's no longer called upon to sail the open seas - or even leave the dock, except for the periodic ceremonial turnaround in Boston Harbor.\par \par \uc2 Massachusetts is lucky to be the home of the USS Constitution. With the "rude bridge that arched the flood" in Concord, Plymouth Rock and scores of other notable sites, events and individuals, our state is rich with history and a major draw for tourists, students and scholars from around the world.\par \par \uc2 Most people may not recall who won the War of 1812 (it ended in a stalemate), and it's probably a sign of the times that the souvenir models of the Constitution in the gift shop bear a "made in China" sticker.\par \par \uc2 But visitors to the real Old Ironsides know her proud legacy \u8212\'20\'14 a vessel unique in the purest sense of the word \u8212\'20\'14 that extends far beyond the wharf in Charlestown.\par \par \uc2 Online: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://bit.ly/2uFWvW1"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://bit.ly/2uFWvW1}}}\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 RHODE ISLAND\par \par \uc2 The Providence Journal\par \par \uc2 July 26\par \par \uc2 It is welcome news that, 11 years after a slump began, Rhode Island has finally made up for the number of jobs it lost. According to a report by the \uc2 Rhode Island Department of Labor\uc2 , the state reached a new all-time high of 496,600 jobs in June.\par \par \uc2 Politicians spun the results as evidence their policies are working. And certainly, \uc2 Gov. Gina Raimondo\uc2  has been much more aggressive than her predecessor in trying to attract jobs. But it is crucially important that the people of Rhode Island understand that, in terms of creating a vibrant economy here, the heavy lifting has yet to be done.\par \par \uc2 The happy headline, unfortunately, does not tell the whole story. Mimicking a national trend, lower-paying service jobs generally replaced middle-class manufacturing jobs in Rhode Island. The state's Gross Domestic Product growth has been more sluggish than that of the nation. And the state still seems to be first-in, and last-out, when a recession hits. Other states suffered less of a decline and matched their previous jobs high much faster than Rhode Island.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, a statistic tracked by economist \uc2 Leonard Lardaro\uc2  of the \uc2 University of Rhode Island\uc2  portends what he calls a "train wreck" for Rhode Island. While the total labor force of the United States \u8212\'20\'14 those either working or unemployed but actively seeking employment \u8212\'20\'14 has grown markedly, the number in the state has fallen precipitously, Professor Lardaro notes. Unless it can attract or develop large numbers of skilled workers, Rhode Island faces a bleak economic future.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Lardaro also wonders if the new job numbers might have to be revised downward later, since they do not seem to coincide with tax revenues. The legislature had to scramble late in the session to trim the budget when revenue projections were lowered. Something does not add up.\par \par \uc2 Clearly, the state should be doing much more to stimulate its economy.\par \par \uc2 Its taxes should be more competitive, something that becomes difficult when the legislature repeatedly rewards special interests, making high property taxes all but inevitable. Rhode Island's overall business climate remains one of the worst in America, according to surveys such as one conducted by CNBC. Businesses complain of a stifling regulatory environment, with the legislature constantly threatening to impose additional burdens. Unlike other states, Rhode Island fails to analyze, in any systematic way, the economic impact of public policies. Rather, it flies blind.\par \par \uc2 The state's public education system is not nearly as good as it should be, with Governor Raimondo advancing only weak and timid reforms. The state continues to under-invest in higher education. These policies contribute to a workforce that is not as well-educated as it must be if Rhode Island is to become an economic engine for high-paying jobs.\par \par \uc2 This is not to say Rhode Island is not trying. Ms. Raimondo has pressed hard to use economic incentives to attract middle-class jobs and make the state a center of innovation. She has worked to match job training to employers' needs. She has encouraged education in computer skills in the public schools.\par \par \uc2 But these are only small parts of big, bold changes that must be made. While the long recession that gripped the state may be weakening, our leaders must do much more to transform Rhode Island's economy from a coughing jalopy belching clouds of exhaust to something approaching a well-tuned Ferrari.\par \par \uc2 Online: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://bit.ly/2tKZ6v0"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://bit.ly/2tKZ6v0}}}\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020170728ed7s00m87\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 MILWAUKEE (AP) \u8212\'20\'14 Immigrant rights groups are accusing Milwaukee leaders of caving in to pressure from the Trump administration and quietly expanding cooperation with immigration officials.\par \par \uc2 One group, Voces de la Frontera, says Milwaukee officials are weakening safeguards for immigrants by making it easier for the Milwaukee Police Department to work with federal immigration agents. The group also warns the changes could lead to racial profiling, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported Tuesday ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://bit.ly/2te2fFQ"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://bit.ly/2te2fFQ}}}\uc2  ).\par \par \uc2 Barrett spokesman Jeff Fleming said the mayor remains committed to immigrants.\par \par \uc2 "The mayor is not wavering at all in his support of immigrants in Milwaukee. For reasons of technical compliance, some changes were required in official policy," Fleming said. "But again the mayor stands with immigrants, the immigrant community and the entire city on respecting the value of immigrants."\par \par \uc2 But Voces' executive director, Christine Neumann-Ortiz, criticized changes in standard operating procedures that were approved last month by Police Chief Edward Flynn and are set to take effect Thursday.\par \par \uc2 One eliminates a directive that officers were not to question people about their immigration status unless they met a narrow list of criteria. Another change states that officers "shall inform" federal immigration officials of the whereabouts or behaviors of any "suspected \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 " when that person is arrested for a felony or other serious crimes, such as those involving terrorism or street gangs.\par \par \uc2 "It literally mandates that the Police Department turn over the information," said \uc2 Darryl Morin\uc2  of the \uc2 League of United Latin American Citizens\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The Milwaukee Police Department did not respond to the newspaper's requests for comment.\par \par \uc2 Morin and Neumann-Ortiz said the policy changes occurred largely out of view of the public.\par \par \uc2 "We completely condemn the undemocratic process by which this decision was made," Neumann-Ortiz said. "Basically the community was kept in the dark that the city, under Barrett's leadership, was caving into pressure from the Trump administration."\par \par \uc2 The Trump administration threatened in April to cut grant money for Milwaukee County, but not the city, over so-called sanctuary policies for immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Barrett has been a vocal critic of efforts by President \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  and his administration to clamp down on "sanctuary cities," repeatedly saying they were trying to force local governments to act as "border guards."\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 Information from: Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.jsonline.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.jsonline.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020170704ed7400kde\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) \u8212\'20\'14 Warning of threats to public safety and national security, the Republican-led House on Thursday approved two bills to crack down on illegal immigration, a key priority for President \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 One bill would strip federal dollars from self-proclaimed "sanctuary" cities that shield residents from federal immigration authorities, while a separate measure would stiffen punishments for people who re-enter the U.S. illegally.\par \par \uc2 The sanctuary measure was approved 228-195, while the bill to punish deportees was approved 257-167. Three Democrats joined all but seven Republicans to pass the sanctuary measure, while 24 Democrats backed the deportee bill. Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan was the only Republican who opposed the deportee bill.\par \par \uc2 The bills now go to the Senate.\par \par \uc2 Trump, who often railed against illegal immigration during his presidential campaign, hailed passage of the House bills and urged the Senate to act "save American lives." Trump met at the White House this week with more than a dozen family members of those killed by people in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 "Opposing these bills, and allowing dangerous criminals back into our communities, our schools and the neighborhoods where our children play, puts all of us at risk," Trump said.\par \par \uc2 One of the bills, known as "Kate's Law," would impose harsher prison sentences on deportees who re-enter the United States. The bill is named after 32-year old Kathryn Steinle, who was shot and killed in San Francisco in 2015 by a man who was in the country illegally. Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, who pleaded not guilty to the crime, had been released by sheriff's officials months earlier despite a request by immigration officials to keep him behind bars.\par \par \uc2 The second bill would bar states and localities that refuse to cooperate with immigration authorities from receiving certain Justice Department and Homeland Security grants, including some related to law enforcement and terrorism.\par \par \uc2 Rep. Bob Goodlatte\uc2 , R-Va., chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said the two bills would help "avoid the kind of tragic circumstances that have totally involved the lives of the people who were at the White House ... speaking up for their loved ones."\par \par \uc2 The sanctuary measure follows "a simple principle that if you're going to receive taxpayer dollars from the federal government to keep people safe, that you've got to follow the law and keep them safe," Goodlatte said.\par \par \uc2 Democrats said the bills were feel-good measures intended to make lawmakers look tough on crime.\par \par \uc2 "We're not doing bumper stickers here. We are doing laws," said Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif.\par \par \uc2 She and other Democrats said the sanctuary measure was "about telling people how to police their cities" and telling local officials that "we in Washington, D.C., know better than you do."\par \par \uc2 Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said he appreciates Congress' effort to "address the dangers of sanctuary cities and \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  offenders."\par \par \uc2 At a news conference at the Capitol with House Speaker \uc2 Paul Ryan\uc2 , Kelly said his agency "will enforce the laws that are passed by Congress," adding, "I am offended when members of this institution put pressure and often threaten me and my officers to ignore the laws they make."\par \par \uc2 A spokesman said later that Kelly "will continue to push back against any attempt \u8212\'20\'14 pressure, threat or otherwise \u8212\'20\'14 to ignore the enforcement of immigration law."\par \par \uc2 "Enforcement is not selective, occasional or arbitrary, it's the law," spokesman David Lapan said.\par \par \uc2 The Justice Department's inspector general has identified California and major cities such as Chicago, New York and Philadelphia as locales with barriers to information-sharing among local police and immigration officials. The Trump administration warned nine jurisdictions in late April that they could lose coveted law enforcement grant money unless they document cooperation.\par \par \uc2 Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who met with the families Thursday, said Steinle "would still be alive today if only the city of San Francisco had put the public's safety first. How many more Americans must die before we put an end to this madness?"\par \par \uc2 Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., said "Kate's Law" would not have had an impact on the Steinle case, noting that Steinle was killed in July 2015 by an immigrant who had been mistakenly released by the federal Bureau of Prisons.\par \par \uc2 The proposed bill "would not have kept Kate Steinle's killer off the streets," Gutierrez said. "Instead, we are voting on a bill to put other people \u8212\'20\'14 in different circumstances \u8212\'20\'14 in jail for longer periods of time. It is a bait-and-switch strategy: Use a horrible tragedy to sell a policy that would not have prevented that death, so that you put more immigrants in jail for longer periods of time."\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 Follow Matthew Daly: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://twitter.com/MatthewDalyWDC"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://twitter.com/MatthewDalyWDC}}}\par \par \uc2 House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., is joined by Rep.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) \u8212\'20\'14 Warning of threats to public safety and national security, the Republican-led House on Thursday approved two bills to crack down on illegal immigration, a key priority for President \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 One bill would strip federal dollars from self-proclaimed "sanctuary" cities that shield residents from federal immigration authorities, while a separate measure would stiffen punishments for people who re-enter the U.S. illegally.\par \par \uc2 The sanctuary measure was approved 228-195, while the bill to punish deportees was approved 257-167. Three Democrats joined all but seven Republicans to pass the sanctuary measure, while 24 Democrats backed the deportee bill. Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan was the only Republican who opposed the deportee bill.\par \par \uc2 The bills now go to the Senate.\par \par \uc2 Trump, who often railed against illegal immigration during his presidential campaign, hailed passage of the House bills and urged the Senate to act "save American lives." Trump met at the White House this week with more than a dozen family members of those killed by people in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 "Opposing these bills, and allowing dangerous criminals back into our communities, our schools and the neighborhoods where our children play, puts all of us at risk," Trump said.\par \par \uc2 One of the bills, known as "Kate's Law," would impose harsher prison sentences on deportees who re-enter the United States. The bill is named after 32-year old Kathryn Steinle, who was shot and killed in San Francisco in 2015 by a man who was in the country illegally. Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, who pleaded not guilty to the crime, had been released by sheriff's officials months earlier despite a request by immigration officials to keep him behind bars.\par \par \uc2 The second bill would bar states and localities that refuse to cooperate with immigration authorities from receiving certain Justice Department and Homeland Security grants, including some related to law enforcement and terrorism.\par \par \uc2 Rep. Bob Goodlatte\uc2 , R-Va., chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said the two bills would help "avoid the kind of tragic circumstances that have totally involved the lives of the people who were at the White House ... speaking up for their loved ones."\par \par \uc2 The sanctuary measure follows "a simple principle that if you're going to receive taxpayer dollars from the federal government to keep people safe, that you've got to follow the law and keep them safe," Goodlatte said.\par \par \uc2 Democrats said the bills were feel-good measures intended to make lawmakers look tough on crime.\par \par \uc2 "We're not doing bumper stickers here. We are doing laws," said Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif.\par \par \uc2 She and other Democrats said the sanctuary measure was "about telling people how to police their cities" and telling local officials that "we in Washington, D.C., know better than you do."\par \par \uc2 Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said he appreciates Congress' effort to "address the dangers of sanctuary cities and \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  offenders."\par \par \uc2 At a news conference at the Capitol with House Speaker \uc2 Paul Ryan\uc2 , Kelly said his agency "will enforce the laws that are passed by Congress," adding, "I am offended when members of this institution put pressure and often threaten me and my officers to ignore the laws they make."\par \par \uc2 A spokesman said later that Kelly "will continue to push back against any attempt \u8212\'20\'14 pressure, threat or otherwise \u8212\'20\'14 to ignore the enforcement of immigration law."\par \par \uc2 "Enforcement is not selective, occasional or arbitrary, it's the law," spokesman David Lapan said.\par \par \uc2 The Justice Department's inspector general has identified California and major cities such as Chicago, New York and Philadelphia as locales with barriers to information-sharing among local police and immigration officials. The Trump administration warned nine jurisdictions in late April that they could lose coveted law enforcement grant money unless they document cooperation.\par \par \uc2 and Attorney General Jeff Sessions met with the families Thursday.Sessions said Steinle "would still be alive today if only the city of San Francisco had put the public's safety first. How many more Americans must die before we put an end to this madness?"\par \par \uc2 Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., said "Kate's Law" would not have had an impact on the Steinle case, noting that Steinle was killed in July 2015 by an immigrant who had been mistakenly released by the federal Bureau of Prisons.\par \par \uc2 The proposed bill "would not have kept Kate Steinle's killer off the streets," Gutierrez said. "Instead, we are voting on a bill to put other people \u8212\'20\'14 in different circumstances \u8212\'20\'14 in jail for longer periods of time. It is a bait-and-switch strategy: Use a horrible tragedy to sell a policy that would not have prevented that death, so that you put more immigrants in jail for longer periods of time."\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 Follow Matthew Daly: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://twitter.com/MatthewDalyWDC"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://twitter.com/MatthewDalyWDC}}}\par \par \uc2 House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., left, is joined by House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., right, as the Republican-led House pushes ahead on legislation to crack down on illegal immigration, during a news conference at the Capitol in Washington, Thursday, June 29, 2017.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 BRUSSELS (AP) \u8212\'20\'14 \uc2 European Union\uc2  lawmakers have called for an investigation of member-state Hungary to determine whether its laws are in "serious breach of \uc2 EU\uc2  values."\par \par \uc2 The move reflects deep concerns within the \uc2 EU\uc2  about whether there has been a deterioration in human rights, democracy and the rule of law there.\par \par \uc2 In a resolution adopted Wednesday by 393 votes to 221 with 64 abstentions, the lawmakers call on Hungary to withdraw tough new laws on asylum seekers and non-governmental organizations.\par \par \uc2 They also want Budapest to reach an agreement with U.S. authorities so a university funded by \uc2 George Soros\uc2  can continue to operate freely in the Hungarian capital. Hungary says the university is issuing Hungarian and American diplomas, giving it an unfair advantage over other schools.\par \par \uc2 The resolution demands that an \uc2 EU\uc2  procedure be triggered to investigate whether the laws are in "serious breach of \uc2 EU\uc2  values." It could lead to the suspension of Hungary's \uc2 EU\uc2  voting rights.\par \par \uc2 But Hungarian Foreign Minister \uc2 Peter Szijjarto\uc2  said the government refuses to bow to European pressure and will continue "to practice a migration policy that is exclusively aimed at ensuring the security of Hungary and the Hungarian people."\par \par \uc2 "Not a single \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  will be allowed to set foot in Hungary," he added.\par \par \uc2 Liberal EU lawmaker Sophie In't Veld said Prime Minister \uc2 Viktor Orban\uc2  "has systematically undermined all critical voices and opposition forces."\par \par \uc2 "He is guilty of interfering with academic freedom, controlling the school curriculum, gagging the media, harassing NGOs, undermining the independence of the judiciary and limiting freedom of religion. Under his watch, asylum seekers are maltreated and detained in shameful conditions, while government campaigns have fanned racism and hatred," she said.\par \par \uc2 Last month, the \uc2 European Commission\uc2  sent a "letter of formal notice" to Orban's government, which is a first step in legal action, over the education law believed to target the Soros-backed \uc2 Central European University\uc2  .\par \par \uc2 That dispute is part of a wider government campaign against the billionaire philanthropist. Orban claims Soros is undermining Hungarian interests because of his support for migrants.\par \par \uc2 Tens of thousands of people have crossed into and through Hungary in recent years. Orban is determined to stop more from coming.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 Pablo Gorondi in Budapest contributed.\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020170517ed5h00gaa\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The (Colorado Springs) Gazette, May 17, on the state's oil and gas industry:\par \par \uc2 Gov. John Hickenlooper has until Thursday to appeal a Colorado Court of Appeals ruling that requires state oil and gas regulators to reconsider a petition for rule-making from a group of Boulder teenagers.\par \par \uc2 The 2013 case was brought by Xiuhtezcatl Martinez and other teens who demanded state regulators deny oil and gas drilling permits "unless the best available science demonstrates, and an independent third party organization confirms, that drilling can occur in a manner that does not cumulatively, with other actions, impair Colorado's atmosphere, water, wildlife, and land resources, does not adversely impact human health and does not contribute to climate change."\par \par \uc2 The court ruled the justification the \uc2 Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission\uc2  used to dismiss the petition was not legal. It ordered the case remanded back to the district court and to the commission, which will need to reconsider the petition for proposed rule-making. The court did not rule on the merits of the petition, simply stating the commission couldn't dismiss it without consideration.\par \par \uc2 What the students asked for in their petition is beyond unreasonable. If turned into a rule, it would cripple Colorado's oil and gas industry, which seems to be their intent. If we required as much of all other human activities, the state would need to forbid marijuana cultivation and consumption, farming, bicycling and most other forms of transportation. All human activity has a cumulative effect on the environment. One cannot power a city without affecting the environment.\par \par \uc2 If made into a rule, the teens' petition would jeopardize an industry essential to the welfare of Colorado's economy. It would eliminate high-wage jobs that support Colorado's households and schools. If the demands are met, the commission would appease idealistic teens at the expense of working adults who pay taxes, provide for children and fund our schools.\par \par \uc2 Fracking has provided oil and gas for more than 40 years and caused no major environmental catastrophes. The \uc2 EPA\uc2 's Gold King Mine spill did more environmental harm in one afternoon.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Colorado Department of Health and Environment\uc2  recently assessed more than 10,000 air quality samples taken near fracking operations. It examined 62 substances of concern for people living or working within 500 feet of fossil fuel production rigs. The scientific assessment found concentrations of toxins surrounding oil and gas wells are lower than standard limits set by the \uc2 EPA\uc2  for short- and long-term exposure.\par \par \uc2 Dangers of modern oil and gas extraction are highly exaggerated.\par \par \uc2 Hickenlooper understands the importance of energy and the jobs provided by oil and gas production. We trust that he will consult with his best legal advisers and determine a course of action that protects this vital industry.\par \par \uc2 Editorial: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://bit.ly/2qwf0IY"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://bit.ly/2qwf0IY}}}\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Durango Herald\uc2 , May 16, on suicide awareness:\par \par \uc2 The presenter at last week's suicide awareness session at Miller Middle School made clear how important it is to speak up when sensing that someone may be contemplating taking his or her own life, and that can be done without any experience or training.\par \par \uc2 The more direct the questions the better, said Susan Becker of \uc2 Colorado Mesa University\uc2  in Grand Junction. The more direct you are in your questioning the more likely the distressed individual will believe you are sincere in your concern and in your offer to help.\par \par \uc2 "Encourage the person to keep talking," she said, "and if you have to step away to contact a professional, make the person promise not to harm himself or herself in the meantime." Do appear hopeful, and let the person know you are an ally.\par \par \uc2 According to Becker, the three points to remember are 1) approach and be observant; 2) ask directly; and 3) agree to stay safe.\par \par \uc2 She also dispelled the concerns which many might have about being assertive at such a sensitive time: "Communication lowers the risk of suicide, not increases it," she said. "Intervene, but do not feel you then become responsible for any outcome; you are not."\par \par \uc2 And while the intervener should not be reluctant to bring the subject up for fearing of being responsible, they should have the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline number available (800-273-8255).\par \par \uc2 Becker spoke to about 600 people at the forum arranged by San Juan Basin Public Health Department following numerous suicides in La Plata County in recent months. While the greatest concern has been the number of teenagers who have taken their lives, and Becker's instructions could at least partially apply to them, her list of warning signs and intervention techniques seemed more likely to be appropriate to adults. Becker included the loss of a job, changing personal relationships and economic challenges as some of the causes.\par \par \uc2 There are differences between suicidal motivations for a teenager and for a 40-year-old and for a 65-year-old.\par \par \uc2 The community can expect and should take part in more conversations about suicide in the coming months.\par \par \uc2 Dan Snowberger, Superintendent of Durango School District 9-R, for example, used his column in the Herald (May 13) to state the district's and his concerns about youth suicide, and to offer suggestions as to how to recognize its possible causes. He stressed the value of plenty of communication, as well.\par \par \uc2 Those who attended last week's meeting are now wiser about suicide, but there is much more to learn.\par \par \uc2 Editorial: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://bit.ly/2qw3Ofe"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://bit.ly/2qw3Ofe}}}\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 The Aurora Sentinel, May 16, on Aurora voting not to be a sanctuary city:\par \par \uc2 It's telling that on the same day that Aurora boasted having landed the state's new El Salvador Consulate \u8212\'20\'14 a testament to the city's diverse and global reach \u8212\'20\'14 six council members later in the day would sully the victory and the city with a misguided demand that succumbs to fear and panders to xenophobia.\par \par \uc2 The Aurora City Council embarrassed itself and all of Aurora Monday night by approving 6-4 a useless resolution insisting that Aurora is not a so-called sanctuary city.\par \par \uc2 At best, it was a forewarned act of ignorance and naivet\u233\'00\'E9. At worst it was a flagrant act of cowardice and pandering to a devolving and hateful group of Americans emboldened by a sympathetic president flailing in Washington.\par \par \uc2 The resolution states that Aurora complies with federal immigration police and laws, especially U.S.C 1373 in Title 8, which prohibits states and cities from enacting laws that prohibit local officials from communicating with the federal government. It's that law that the Trump Administration is unsuccessfully trying to use against cities such as San Francisco and New York City, which have flagrantly worked to thwart federal immigration agents from forcing local police to act as immigration officers.\par \par \uc2 Aurora has never done anything like that. But Aurora has made it clear that its police force are not immigration officers. They've done that to protect all of the public. By assuring everyone that Aurora's cops don't ask about citizenship, they ensure that illegal immigrants don't leave the scene of accidents and crimes. They ensure that criminals don't seek out and prey on illegal immigrants, knowing they won't call police. They know that children and women will report abuse to police, knowing that their immigration status isn't an issue, but stopping and punishing their victimizer is a big issue. Legal immigrants know that they don't have to be harassed by police or others in the community who profile them because they are minorities or speak little English or with a foreign accent.\par \par \uc2 There are myriad good reasons why Aurora and similar communities ensure that its police do not enforce federal immigration laws.\par \par \uc2 But council members Bob Roth, Francoise Bergan, Brad Pierce, Sally Mounier, Angela Lawson and Renie Peterson talked Monday about being afraid that the Trump administration, which has showed no interest in Aurora's policy on immigration, would turn against our community and try to withhold federal funds, like it has tried to do unsuccessfully with cities like San Francisco.\par \par \uc2 There were no good reasons to pass this resolution at all, and especially right now.\par \par \uc2 For those city lawmakers who rationalized their votes based on fear, they fail to realize how chilling their cowardice was in light of what's at stake. This is an administration under attack from the courts for trying to ban Muslims from entering the country. The administration is led by a president who seriously and repeatedly talked about identifying Muslim citizens with a registry. While President \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  is currently is under fire from both parties for trying to thwart an investigation into possible collusion between his campaign and Russian enemies, his administration is also consumed with trying to defend a dangerous release of classified secrets to Russian diplomats.\par \par \uc2 Trying to pander to his xenophobic and bigoted base by paying attention to illegal immigration is the least of Trump's concerns these days.\par \par \uc2 This is an increasingly dangerous and unpredictable president who has made clear he has no respect for government institutions and rights that protect and honor American diversity, which is a noted strength and hallmark of Aurora.\par \par \uc2 While so much of the country suffers deeply from racism and xenophobia, Aurora has long been a shining example of what the American cultural and racial melting pot can be. This city not only attracts like-minded residents, it has capitalized on its welcoming culture by landing commercial interests, which now may be put at risk by this misguided move.\par \par \uc2 Despite proponents' arguments, this resolution not only undermines what Aurora actually is, it endangers it.\par \par \uc2 All of Aurora suffers when officials like these six lawmakers cower in fear from Trump and his administration. All of the region suffers when leaders believe they must publicly defend the city's lawful policies against allegations from bigoted social media trolls and disgraced cable TV personalities.\par \par \uc2 This resolution does nothing to protect the city, federal funds or anyone. What it does is send a clear message that a thin majority of the Aurora City Council is afraid of the Trump Administration, and immigrants should be, too. It sends the chilling effect into the heart of the city's large legal and \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  community that they can't trust city leaders and police, which is the exact opposite of what Aurora police have worked so hard and so successfully to prevent.\par \par \uc2 For those council members who naively thought they were doing something right, they can call up this imprudent measure at the next council meeting and overturn it. For those council members who approved this resolution and see it as effective immigration policy, you do not represent the vast Aurora population, nor its police force.\par \par \uc2 It is unforgivable that Congress has been unable to enact immigration laws and policies to rectify this country's long-standing and complex immigration problems. But it's even more unforgivable that at a time when all of Aurora is seeking assurance from local, state and congressional leaders that they will stand firm against inhumane round-ups, Muslim bans and registries or any other executive orders that legitimize policies of hate or xenophobia, these city council members either caved into fear or pandered to Trump and his cause.\par \par \uc2 Editorial: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://bit.ly/2qvTync"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://bit.ly/2qvTync}}}\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 The Denver Post, May 13, on Wins in 2017 Colorado legislature:\par \par \uc2 The Colorado General Assembly concluded on Wednesday with a few very clear winners who struck important compromises on issues critical to the state: Senate President Kevin Grantham, R-Ca\u241\'00\'F1on City; House Speaker Crisanta Duran, D-Denver; and Gov. John Hickenlooper.\par \par \uc2 Even though some of the top bills to pass in 2017 don't have those three names on them, it speaks volumes for the political leaders that they were willing to switch gears and back bills brought forward by others in their caucuses. That's statesmanship. Grantham, Duran and Hickenlooper should ask their critics what exactly they accomplished in the last 120 days.\par \par \uc2 First, after years of unsuccessful attempts to reign in lawsuits over faulty construction of multifamily housing, House Bill 1279 will require more than half of the owners in a project to approve litigation before it moves forward.\par \par \uc2 Second, charter schools will finally get a fair share of voter-approved property tax increases that benefit school district operations over and above state funding, in House Bill 1375.\par \par \uc2 Third, Senate Bill 267 doesn't raise tax rates but forgoes anticipated taxpayer refunds required under the Taxpayer's Bill of Rights. The bill provides:\par \par \uc2 $1.88 billion over 20 years for transportation\par \par \uc2 $528 million for hospitals raised through the 2009 fee levied on hospital stays used to offset costs of treating low-income and indigent patients\par \par \uc2 $200 million reduction in the Taxpayer's Bill of Rights spending cap (limiting government spending even more than where voters set it with Referendum C in 2005)\par \par \uc2 $20 million in tax credits in 2019-20 for Colorado businesses to offset the loathsome business personal property tax\par \par \uc2 $40 million in increased marijuana taxes by raising the special sales tax to 15 percent in 2017-18\par \par \uc2 $30 million for rural schools in 2017-18\par \par \uc2 $20 million for all K-12 schools in 2018-19 and 2019-20\par \par \uc2 Additionally, it requires every state agency to present a budget next year that proposes an optional 2 percent reduction in funding.\par \par \uc2 We agree with Rep. Tim Leonard's concerns that so much occurred in a single omnibus bill. It feels like the pork-laden, earmark-riddled legislation Congress (supposedly) used to peddle. For example, a little-reported part of the bill will change how refunds are paid out when the state exceeds its new, lower revenue limit. That change, which counts payments already being made to counties to offset the senior homestead property tax exemption, is almost enough to offset the entire $200 million TABOR cap reduction.\par \par \uc2 However, Colorado was on the verge of having one of the best economies in the nation and simultaneously having to cut funding for higher education and other critical services. The people to blame for the complexity of this funding measure are those who have over the years pushed voters to approve constitutional amendments mandating spending and austerity through formulas.\par \par \uc2 Oh, and also sharing in the blame for such a complex bill to solve Colorado's budget problems are the three Republicans in the Senate who defeated a much simpler bill, a bill we preferred that would have simply asked voters whether they wanted to raise the statewide sales tax to fund roads and exempt that new revenue from TABOR.\par \par \uc2 In the end only Republicans opposed SB 267 \u8212\'20\'14 10 in the Senate and 16 in the House.\par \par \uc2 The alternative many of those 26 lawmakers supported was asking voters to encumber the state with billions in bonds to pay for roads without a dedicated funding source. That's like taking a mortgage on a house without finding money in the budget to make the monthly payments.\par \par \uc2 Fortunately, Colorado is known for producing statesmen who put the state above party politics.\par \par \uc2 Editorial: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://dpo.st/2qvuAVi"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://dpo.st/2qvuAVi}}}\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020170517ed5h00pv8\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 NEW YORK (AP) \u8212\'20\'14 In May 2002, Associated Press National Writer Jerry Schwartz interviewed the famously blunt-yet-lyric author and columnist Jimmy Breslin about his life and work. Breslin died Sunday at age 88. The following story was originally published on May 25, 2002:\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 At 73, he's no longer the hulking Irish wild man of yore.\par \par \uc2 He's slighter. His hair is white and thin, not black and tangled. It's been years since he knocked back beers at Pep McGuire's or the Lion's Head or his friend Mutchie's saloon \u8212\'20\'14 Mutchie is dead, like the bookmaker Fat Thomas and Shelly the Bail Bondsman and so many of the characters who peopled his columns for so many years.\par \par \uc2 But Jimmy Breslin says he has not changed.\par \par \uc2 Thirty-nine years after his first story appeared in the New York Herald Tribune \u8212\'20\'14 a Page One piece on the Mets, their four-game winning streak and their bungling first baseman, Marvelous Marvin Throneberry \u8212\'20\'14 he's still writing columns, three a week, but now for \uc2 Newsday\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 His columns are still littered with blunt and beautiful phrases, and they're still fueled by rage at how the powerful afflict the powerless. Now, he writes of pedophile priests, and of cardinals who "will say anything, cling to any piece of driftwood and hide anywhere, but never mention that the problem is their lying, covering up and betraying their people as they do so."\par \par \uc2 He has a new book, too \u8212\'20\'14 a fine, angry book about an 18-year-old \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Mexico who came to New York in search of opportunity but instead tumbled from a collapsing, substandard construction site into three feet of concrete, and drowned.\par \par \uc2 He cannot tell you how long he worked on "The Short Sweet Dream of Eduardo Gutierrez."\par \par \uc2 "When people ask how long did it take ya, ya gotta say, 'my whole life,'" he says.\par \par \uc2 "But I was obsessed with the topic. I did it without any thought of money. Because I know I'm selling a book about a dead Mexican. That REALLY is gonna be a huge success. I did it because I wanted to do it, it should be done. I don't know of any good it can do beyond that. You do it honestly, you tell the freakin' truth and go home."\par \par \uc2 This is how he does his job. In that sense, Breslin has not changed at all.\par \par \uc2 He still awakens at 4:30 or 5 a.m., and announces to his sleeping wife, Ronnie Eldridge, "That's it. I'm up." He rumbles around the apartment, spilling coffee. He calls his editor at Newsday, \uc2 John Mancini\uc2 , and asks, "What's out there? What do you have?"\par \par \uc2 And then he goes out and finds the story he wants. He writes it, turns it in, and then he tells Eldridge all about it, before \uc2 Newsday\uc2 's 578,000 readers find out.\par \par \uc2 Other columnists have owned their cities, writers like Mike Royko in Chicago, Herb Caen in San Francisco. Breslin survives them.\par \par \uc2 And through the years, other New York columnists have been ballyhooed as "new Breslins." But none has ever matched Breslin's outsized bond with this city.\par \par \uc2 There is nobody out there like Jimmy Breslin.\par \par \uc2 "There never was," he says, with a swagger that is unchanged.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 Jim Bellows came to New York to edit the Herald Tribune by way of Shaker Heights, Ohio, Columbus, Ga., and Miami. He didn't know his new city. He needed a guide, and he was convinced that the Herald Tribune needed a guide as well.\par \par \uc2 The Trib was renowned for its national and international coverage, but not for its reporting on New York; Bellows was determined to change that, and Breslin was part of the plan.\par \par \uc2 Queens to the bone, Breslin had started as a copyboy and worked his way up to sportswriter at the Long Island Press. He wrote sports for \uc2 Scripps-Howard\uc2  and for Hearst. Bellows wanted him to bring the creativity of a sports columnist to the news pages. He wanted to get away from reportage that featured the "high muckety-mucks," and give voice to the city's people.\par \par \uc2 Breslin "was just so New Yorkie," says Bellows, who remembers those days in his new book "The Last Editor." ''He knew the city and its streets and exactly what we needed."\par \par \uc2 Breslin always knew that he could write about large issues by focusing on human stories. "You keep the facts alive with people," he wrote, in a 1964 memo to Bellows proposing a series of stories about life in Harlem.\par \par \uc2 When other reporters zigged, Breslin zagged.\par \par \uc2 "I ain't gonna get nowhere if I'm with everybody else," he says. "They'll drown me. I better go out on my own. If I'm all alone in a place I feel safe."\par \par \uc2 Sent to Washington to cover the funeral of John F. Kennedy, Breslin left the roiling crowd of reporters behind to write about the $3.01-an-hour laborer who dug the president's grave. Along with his best-selling novel "The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight," the 1,042 words of the gravedigger's story are perhaps Breslin's most famous.\par \par \uc2 He specialized in a spare, straightforward prose, with the occasional line that left the reader gasping and laughing:\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14"The first funeral for Andrew Goodman was at night and it was a lot of work. To begin with they had to kill him."\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14"Football is a game designed to keep coal miners off the streets."\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14"The auditorium, named after a dead Queens politician, is windowless in honor of the secrecy in which he lived and, probably, the bank vaults he frequented."\par \par \uc2 His writing and stories and personality brought him celebrity. In 1969, when Norman Mailer ran for mayor, Breslin was his running-mate for City Council president. They lost, but the campaign waged from the Lion's Head tavern was legendarily loopy.\par \par \uc2 It was Breslin to whom David Berkowitz, the Son of Sam killer, wrote as he terrorized young women across the city in 1977 ("I also want to tell you that I read your column daily and find it quite informative"). It was Breslin whose carousing was so renowned that he appeared in a commercial for Piels beer ("a good drinkin' beah").\par \par \uc2 He won a Pulitzer Prize, at The Daily News. He hosted "Saturday Night Live." He even had a late-night television show. "Jimmy Breslin's People" lasted just 13 weeks in 1986; Breslin was constantly enraged at ABC for allowing stations to air it at all hours, and finally placed a front-page ad in The \uc2 New York Times\uc2 :\par \par \uc2 "ABC TELEVISION NETWORK: Your services, such as they are, will no longer be required as of 12-20-86 - Jimmy Breslin."\par \par \uc2 He had canceled his own program.\par \par \uc2 The fact is, he didn't like doing the show. Ronnie Eldridge remembers one morning during its run when they were on vacation and they were lying in bed. Breslin was agitated.\par \par \uc2 "You don't know what it's like to get up in the morning and do something you don't want to do," he announced.\par \par \uc2 That's when it hit her. In all his life, Breslin had never endured drudgery.\par \par \uc2 "He loves his work, and every day he does what he wants to do," she says.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 He doesn't go to the \uc2 Newsday\uc2  office much anymore. In 1990, he was suspended after a display of the fabled Breslin temper. He had written a column in which he suggested that women officials were spending too much time away from home; Eldridge was a City Council member at the time.\par \par \uc2 A Korean-American reporter sent Breslin a message, criticizing the column. Breslin erupted with a tirade that included an obscenity and ethnic slurs. He apologized \u8212\'20\'14 "I am no good and once again I can prove it" \u8212\'20\'14 but the damage was done, and now he writes his columns from home.\par \par \uc2 He says he does not miss the newsroom, because the newsroom of his youth no longer exists.\par \par \uc2 "The Daily News, 5:30 at night. Typewriters. The noise was like a subway, the smoke was thick ... and the nervous energy that I think is required for newspapers was there. And afterwards, everybody ran to the bar, and you discussed stories and leads and people involved and everything and it was a whole business. Now, it's gone," he says.\par \par \uc2 When Breslin does visit the office, "it's like a tornado coming into the room. He likes to make a lot of noise," says his editor, Mancini.\par \par \uc2 He was there in November 1999 when somebody mentioned a Mexican immigrant's death in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Instantly, Breslin thought of a favorite book, "Christ in Concrete," written in 1937 by Pietro di Donato. The book tells the story of an Italian immigrant who drowns in concrete at a construction site.\par \par \uc2 Breslin ran to Williamsburg, he says, "and then I never left."\par \par \uc2 He went to San Matias, the town in Mexico where Eduardo Gutierrez grew up and where he was buried. He combed the border, tracking the trails of immigrants. He visited dumpy apartments in Brooklyn, barracks for depressed and homesick Mexicans. He delved into papers detailing the corruption that allowed a death trap to be built.\par \par \uc2 He did not use researchers. "You don't have the immediacy. Your fingers must be on the subject at all times." He has always depended on his own hands and feet, and that too will not change, he says: "Climbing staircases. That's all I do."\par \par \uc2 Like that morning last September, when he looked downtown from his penthouse apartment on Manhattan's West Side and saw smoke. "Oh baby, it was there," he says, and he ran to catch what was probably the last subway train downtown, to the World Trade Center.\par \par \uc2 Now, though, he scoffs at suggestions that the attacks altered the world.\par \par \uc2 "It changed nothing for me nor for anyone else. I don't believe a (expletive) word of this, 'We changed forever,'" he says.\par \par \uc2 (Except, of course, in lower Manhattan. "Because it ain't there anymore.")\par \par \uc2 He feels the same way about his own brushes with death: in 1991, when a mob yanked him from a cab during the Crown Heights riots, beat him and stripped him to his underwear; in 1994, when he underwent surgery for a brain aneurysm. He survived \u8212\'20\'14 unchanged, he says \u8212\'20\'14 and turned the page.\par \par \uc2 Perhaps it's because he's "very Catholic," says Ronnie Eldridge. When a friend dies, he scratches their phone number from the book and writes "1-800-HEAVEN."\par \par \uc2 "He believes in heaven and hell. He believes he's lived a good life, and he just believes in fate," she says.\par \par \uc2 And he believes in being Breslin \u8212\'20\'14 brash and blustery and bombastic, climbing staircases, raising hell. A life lived any other way is not worth living.\par \par \uc2 Today's reporters "are the best educated there ever was, and they go home at night and they go to the health club and have a glass of wine at home, with their wives and families. Which is the worst thing they could do all day. And as a result they're going to live long, and they're the most boring (expletive) people who've ever worked in the news business."\par \par \uc2 To be boring, he says, is more than a sin: "That's a felony."\par \par \uc2 He pleads not guilty.\par \par \uc2 FILE - In this Nov. 2, 2004, file photo, author-columnist Jimmy Breslin poses for a photo in his New York apartment.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 MIAMI (AP) \u8212\'20\'14 Not only is the Mexican government not building a wall; it's spending $50 million to beef up its legal aid to migrants who fear deportation, a response to President Donald Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 All 50 Mexican consulates in the U.S. on Friday launched legal assistance centers to form partnerships with nonprofit groups and tap lawyers to help those fearing Trump's policies.\par \par \uc2 The diplomatic effort comes as the two countries are in a rift over Trump's plans for a border wall. While Trump says Mexico will pay for it one way or another, Mexico says it won't. It was also unveiled less than two weeks after new guidelines came out aimed at aggressively detaining and deporting immigrants by increasing the number of federal agents and strengthening cooperation with local law enforcement.\par \par \uc2 Miami's Mexican consul general, Jose Antonio Zabalgoitia, said Friday that these centers would become "authentic advocates of the rights of Mexican migrants."\par \par \uc2 "What changes today is that we are prioritizing legal matters over everything. Previously, we didn't have the need to seek so much legal support for our people," he said. "But now, we need to protect them against an eventual deportation."\par \par \uc2 Mexican consulates are forming partnerships with law schools, immigration clinics and nonprofit groups that litigate on behalf of immigrants. The centers are staffed with Mexican lawyers who can refer cases to organizations or clinics. They are also reaching out to private law firms interested in taking on pro-bono work.\par \par \uc2 Mexican foreign minister Luis Videgaray visited New York City's consulate Friday and called the effort "a moral imperative."\par \par \uc2 "It is something that we will continue to do by obligation and conviction," Videgaray said.\par \par \uc2 Consulates from Mexico and other Central American nations have been juggling numerous inquiries in recent months from migrants concerned about their fate and that of their U.S.-born children.\par \par \uc2 Zabalgoitia said the increase in requests for documents and help is "enormous," as he pointed to a waiting room with dozens of people carrying folders of documents in need of birth certificates, Mexican passports and other identifications. "I used to sign two birth certificates a week. Only yesterday, I signed 15."\par \par \uc2 The increasing demand comes from people like Gloria Portillo, who went to the Mexican consulate in Phoenix on Friday to renew her passport. Her visa expired three years ago, and now she is trying to start the process of becoming a legal resident after marrying a U.S. citizen but fears something could happen in the meantime.\par \par \uc2 "We've been here all of our lives, we have kids, and of course we're afraid to be deported," she said, also speaking of friends and relatives living in the U.S. illegally.\par \par \uc2 Dozens of people visited the consulate in St. Paul, Minnesota, some lining up along the walls and asking the consul general questions. In the Philadelphia mission, which also covers Delaware and southern New Jersey, daily appointments at the consulate have doubled to 400 people, Consul General Alicia Kerber-Palma said. Near Boston, Mexican diplomats have been meeting with families at churches and community events to explain the challenges of claiming U.S.-born children, without dual nationality, after deportation.\par \par \uc2 Mexican diplomats in Houston, where half a million Mexican immigrants live, said requests for Mexican birth certificates at the consulate are up 50 percent since Trump begin announcing tough measures to curb illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 "The tolerance is gone. I think that's the best way of describing it," said Oscar Solis, a first secretary of the Mexican consulate in Houston. "It's like in wars. They come for one person and many who are innocent \u8212\'20\'14 or not really involved \u8212\'20\'14 end up paying."\par \par \uc2 Divina Ciriaco, a 45-year-old housekeeper who lives in the Miami area, said she is gathering all the Mexican documents she would need for her U.S.-born boy to go along with her if she is deported.\par \par \uc2 "We live in fear of going back to Mexico, to the violence, the poverty we suffered," said Ciriaco, who migrated along with her husband and two children 20 years ago from the state of Guerrero. She gave birth to her third child in Miami. "Now, it's just a matter of waiting for that day to come."\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writers Errin Haines Whack in Philadelphia, Matt O'Brien in Providence, Rhode Island, Frank Bajak in Houston, Astrid Galvan in Phoenix and Amy Fortili in St. Paul, Minnesota contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 Illegal immigrant\uc2  Divina Ciriaco, of Mexico, talks to a reporter, at the Mexican Consulate, Friday, March 3, 2017, in Miami.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The text of President \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  's speech to Congress, as released by the White House.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States, and Citizens of America:\par \par \uc2 Tonight, as we mark the conclusion of our celebration of Black History Month, we are reminded of our Nation's path toward civil rights and the work that still remains. Recent threats targeting Jewish Community Centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, as well as last week's shooting in Kansas City, remind us that while we may be a Nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all its forms.\par \par \uc2 Each American generation passes the torch of truth, liberty and justice \u8212\'20\'14 in an unbroken chain all the way down to the present.\par \par \uc2 That torch is now in our hands. And we will use it to light up the world. I am here tonight to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart.\par \par \uc2 A new chapter of American Greatness is now beginning.\par \par \uc2 A new national pride is sweeping across our Nation.\par \par \uc2 And a new surge of optimism is placing impossible dreams firmly within our grasp.\par \par \uc2 What we are witnessing today is the Renewal of the American Spirit.\par \par \uc2 Our allies will find that America is once again ready to lead.\par \par \uc2 All the nations of the world \u8212\'20\'14 friend or foe \u8212\'20\'14 will find that America is strong, America is proud, and America is free.\par \par \uc2 In 9 years, the United States will celebrate the 250th anniversary of our founding \u8212\'20\'14 250 years since the day we declared our Independence.\par \par \uc2 It will be one of the great milestones in the history of the world.\par \par \uc2 But what will America look like as we reach our 250th year? What kind of country will we leave for our children?\par \par \uc2 I will not allow the mistakes of recent decades past to define the course of our future.\par \par \uc2 For too long, we've watched our middle class shrink as we've exported our jobs and wealth to foreign countries.\par \par \uc2 We've financed and built one global project after another, but ignored the fates of our children in the inner cities of Chicago, Baltimore, Detroit \u8212\'20\'14 and so many other places throughout our land.\par \par \uc2 We've defended the borders of other nations, while leaving our own borders wide open, for anyone to cross \u8212\'20\'14 and for drugs to pour in at a now unprecedented rate.\par \par \uc2 And we've spent trillions of dollars overseas, while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled.\par \par \uc2 Then, in 2016, the earth shifted beneath our feet. The rebellion started as a quiet protest, spoken by families of all colors and creeds \u8212\'20\'14 families who just wanted a fair shot for their children, and a fair hearing for their concerns.\par \par \uc2 But then the quiet voices became a loud chorus \u8212\'20\'14 as thousands of citizens now spoke out together, from cities small and large, all across our country.\par \par \uc2 Finally, the chorus became an earthquake \u8212\'20\'14 and the people turned out by the tens of millions, and they were all united by one very simple, but crucial demand, that America must put its own citizens first ... because only then, can we truly MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.\par \par \uc2 Dying industries will come roaring back to life. Heroic veterans will get the care they so desperately need.\par \par \uc2 Our military will be given the resources its brave warriors so richly deserve.\par \par \uc2 Crumbling infrastructure will be replaced with new roads, bridges, tunnels, airports and railways gleaming across our beautiful land.\par \par \uc2 Our terrible drug epidemic will slow down and ultimately, stop.\par \par \uc2 And our neglected inner cities will see a rebirth of hope, safety, and opportunity.\par \par \uc2 Above all else, we will keep our promises to the American people.\par \par \uc2 It's been a little over a month since my inauguration, and I want to take this moment to update the Nation on the progress I've made in keeping those promises.\par \par \uc2 Since my election, \uc2 Ford\uc2  , \uc2 Fiat-Chrysler\uc2  , \uc2 General Motors\uc2  , Sprint, Softbank , \uc2 Lockheed\uc2  , \uc2 Intel\uc2  , \uc2 Walmart\uc2  , and many others, have announced that they will invest billions of dollars in the United States and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs.\par \par \uc2 The stock market has gained almost three trillion dollars in value since the election on November 8th, a record. We've saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by bringing down the price of the fantastic new F-35 jet fighter, and will be saving billions more dollars on contracts all across our Government. We have placed a hiring freeze on non-military and non-essential Federal workers.\par \par \uc2 We have begun to drain the swamp of government corruption by imposing a 5 year ban on lobbying by executive branch officials -- and a lifetime ban on becoming lobbyists for a foreign government.\par \par \uc2 We have undertaken a historic effort to massively reduce job crushing regulations, creating a deregulation task force inside of every Government agency; imposing a new rule which mandates that for every 1 new regulation, 2 old regulations must be eliminated; and stopping a regulation that threatens the future and livelihoods of our great coal miners.\par \par \uc2 We have cleared the way for the construction of the Keystone and Dakota Access Pipelines \u8212\'20\'14 thereby creating tens of thousands of jobs \u8212\'20\'14 and I've issued a new directive that new American pipelines be made with American steel.\par \par \uc2 We have withdrawn the United States from the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership.\par \par \uc2 With the help of Prime Minister \uc2 Justin Trudeau\uc2  , we have formed a Council with our neighbors in Canada to help ensure that women entrepreneurs have access to the networks, markets and capital they need to start a business and live out their financial dreams.\par \par \uc2 To protect our citizens, I have directed the Department of Justice to form a Task Force on Reducing Violent Crime.\par \par \uc2 I have further ordered the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice, along with the Department of State and the Director of National Intelligence, to coordinate an aggressive strategy to dismantle the criminal cartels that have spread across our Nation.\par \par \uc2 We will stop the drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth -- and we will expand treatment for those who have become so badly addicted.\par \par \uc2 At the same time, my Administration has answered the pleas of the American people for immigration enforcement and border security. By finally enforcing our immigration laws, we will raise wages, help the unemployed, save billions of dollars, and make our communities safer for everyone. We want all Americans to succeed \u8212\'20\'14 but that can't happen in an environment of lawless chaos. We must restore integrity and the rule of law to our borders.\par \par \uc2 For that reason, we will soon begin the construction of a great wall along our southern border. It will be started ahead of schedule and, when finished, it will be a very effective weapon against drugs and crime.\par \par \uc2 As we speak, we are removing gang members, drug dealers and criminals that threaten our communities and prey on our citizens. Bad ones are going out as I speak tonight and as I have promised.\par \par \uc2 To any in Congress who do not believe we should enforce our laws, I would ask you this question: what would you say to the American family that loses their jobs, their income, or a loved one, because America refused to uphold its laws and defend its borders?\par \par \uc2 Our obligation is to serve, protect, and defend the citizens of the United States. We are also taking strong measures to protect our Nation from Radical Islamic Terrorism.\par \par \uc2 According to data provided by the Department of Justice, the vast majority of individuals convicted for terrorism-related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country. We have seen the attacks at home \u8212\'20\'14 from Boston to San Bernardino to the Pentagon and yes, even the World Trade Center.\par \par \uc2 We have seen the attacks in France, in Belgium, in Germany and all over the world.\par \par \uc2 It is not compassionate, but reckless, to allow uncontrolled entry from places where proper vetting cannot occur. Those given the high honor of admission to the United States should support this country and love its people and its values.\par \par \uc2 We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America \u8212\'20\'14 we cannot allow our Nation to become a sanctuary for extremists.\par \par \uc2 That is why my Administration has been working on improved vetting procedures, and we will shortly take new steps to keep our Nation safe \u8212\'20\'14 and to keep out those who would do us harm.\par \par \uc2 As promised, I directed the Department of Defense to develop a plan to demolish and destroy ISIS \u8212\'20\'14 a network of lawless savages that have slaughtered Muslims and Christians, and men, women, and children of all faiths and beliefs. We will work with our allies, including our friends and allies in the Muslim world, to extinguish this vile enemy from our planet.\par \par \uc2 I have also imposed new sanctions on entities and individuals who support Iran's ballistic missile program, and reaffirmed our unbreakable alliance with the State of Israel.\par \par \uc2 Finally, I have kept my promise to appoint a Justice to the \uc2 United States Supreme Court\uc2  \u8212\'20\'14 from my list of 20 judges \u8212\'20\'14 who will defend our Constitution. I am honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the gallery tonight. Her late, great husband, Antonin Scalia, will forever be a symbol of American justice. To fill his seat, we have chosen Judge Neil Gorsuch, a man of incredible skill, and deep devotion to the law. He was confirmed unanimously to the Court of Appeals, and I am asking the Senate to swiftly approve his nomination.\par \par \uc2 Tonight, as I outline the next steps we must take as a country, we must honestly acknowledge the circumstances we inherited.\par \par \uc2 Ninety-four million Americans are out of the labor force.\par \par \uc2 Over 43 million people are now living in poverty, and over 43 million Americans are on food stamps.\par \par \uc2 More than 1 in 5 people in their prime working years are not working.\par \par \uc2 We have the worst financial recovery in 65 years.\par \par \uc2 In the last 8 years, the past Administration has put on more new debt than nearly all other Presidents combined.\par \par \uc2 We've lost more than one-fourth of our manufacturing jobs since \uc2 NAFTA\uc2  was approved, and we've lost 60,000 factories since China joined the \uc2 World Trade Organization\uc2  in 2001.\par \par \uc2 Our trade deficit in goods with the world last year was nearly $800 billion dollars.\par \par \uc2 And overseas, we have inherited a series of tragic foreign policy disasters.\par \par \uc2 Solving these, and so many other pressing problems, will require us to work past the differences of party. It will require us to tap into the American spirit that has overcome every challenge throughout our long and storied history.\par \par \uc2 But to accomplish our goals at home and abroad, we must restart the engine of the American economy -- making it easier for companies to do business in the United States, and much harder for companies to leave.\par \par \uc2 Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the highest rates anywhere in the world.\par \par \uc2 My economic team is developing historic tax reform that will reduce the tax rate on our companies so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone. At the same time, we will provide massive tax relief for the middle class.\par \par \uc2 We must create a level playing field for American companies and workers.\par \par \uc2 Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other countries make us pay very high tariffs and taxes -- but when foreign companies ship their products into America, we charge them almost nothing.\par \par \uc2 I just met with officials and workers from a great American company, \uc2 Harley-Davidson\uc2  . In fact, they proudly displayed five of their magnificent motorcycles, made in the USA, on the front lawn of the White House.\par \par \uc2 At our meeting, I asked them, how are you doing, how is business? They said that it's good. I asked them further how they are doing with other countries, mainly international sales. They told me \u8212\'20\'14 without even complaining because they have been mistreated for so long that they have become used to it -- that it is very hard to do business with other countries because they tax our goods at such a high rate. They said that in one case another country taxed their motorcycles at 100 percent.\par \par \uc2 They weren't even asking for change. But I am.\par \par \uc2 I believe strongly in free trade but it also has to be FAIR TRADE.\par \par \uc2 The first Republican President, \uc2 Abraham Lincoln\uc2 , warned that the "abandonment of the protective policy by the American Government (will) produce want and ruin among our people."\par \par \uc2 Lincoln was right \u8212\'20\'14 and it is time we heeded his words. I am not going to let America and its great companies and workers, be taken advantage of anymore.\par \par \uc2 I am going to bring back millions of jobs. Protecting our workers also means reforming our system of legal immigration. The current, outdated system depresses wages for our poorest workers, and puts great pressure on taxpayers.\par \par \uc2 Nations around the world, like Canada, Australia and many others \u8212\'20\'14 have a merit-based immigration system. It is a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be able to support themselves financially. Yet, in America, we do not enforce this rule, straining the very public resources that our poorest citizens rely upon. According to the \uc2 National Academy of Sciences\uc2  , our current immigration system costs America's taxpayers many billions of dollars a year.\par \par \uc2 Switching away from this current system of lower-skilled immigration, and instead adopting a merit-based system, will have many benefits: it will save countless dollars, raise workers' wages, and help struggling families \u8212\'20\'14 including immigrant families \u8212\'20\'14 enter the middle class.\par \par \uc2 I believe that real and positive immigration reform is possible, as long as we focus on the following goals: to improve jobs and wages for Americans, to strengthen our nation's security, and to restore respect for our laws.\par \par \uc2 If we are guided by the well-being of American citizens then I believe Republicans and Democrats can work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades.\par \par \uc2 Another Republican President, Dwight D. Eisenhower, initiated the last truly great national infrastructure program -- the building of the interstate highway system. The time has come for a new program of national rebuilding.\par \par \uc2 America has spent approximately six trillion dollars in the Middle East, all this while our infrastructure at home is crumbling. With this six trillion dollars we could have rebuilt our country \u8212\'20\'14 twice. And maybe even three times if we had people who had the ability to negotiate.\par \par \uc2 To launch our national rebuilding, I will be asking the Congress to approve legislation that produces a $1 trillion investment in the infrastructure of the United States \u8212\'20\'14 financed through both public and private capital -- creating millions of new jobs.\par \par \uc2 This effort will be guided by two core principles: Buy American, and Hire American.\par \par \uc2 Tonight, I am also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare with reforms that expand choice, increase access, lower costs, and at the same time, provide better Healthcare.\par \par \uc2 Mandating every American to buy government-approved health insurance was never the right solution for America. The way to make health insurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of health insurance, and that is what we will do.\par \par \uc2 Obamacare premiums nationwide have increased by double and triple digits. As an example, Arizona went up 116 percent last year alone. Governor Matt Bevin of Kentucky just said Obamacare is failing in his State \u8212\'20\'14 it is unsustainable and collapsing.\par \par \uc2 One third of counties have only one insurer on the exchanges \u8212\'20\'14 leaving many Americans with no choice at all.\par \par \uc2 Remember when you were told that you could keep your doctor, and keep your plan?\par \par \uc2 We now know that all of those promises have been broken.\par \par \uc2 Obamacare is collapsing \u8212\'20\'14 and we must act decisively to protect all Americans. Action is not a choice \u8212\'20\'14 it is a necessity.\par \par \uc2 So I am calling on all Democrats and Republicans in the Congress to work with us to save Americans from this imploding Obamacare disaster.\par \par \uc2 Here are the principles that should guide the Congress as we move to create a better healthcare system for all Americans:\par \par \uc2 First, we should ensure that Americans with pre-existing conditions have access to coverage, and that we have a stable transition for Americans currently enrolled in the healthcare exchanges.\par \par \uc2 Secondly, we should help Americans purchase their own coverage, through the use of tax credits and expanded Health Savings Accounts \u8212\'20\'14 but it must be the plan they want, not the plan forced on them by the Government.\par \par \uc2 Thirdly, we should give our great State Governors the resources and flexibility they need with Medicaid to make sure no one is left out.\par \par \uc2 Fourthly, we should implement legal reforms that protect patients and doctors from unnecessary costs that drive up the price of insurance \u8212\'20\'14 and work to bring down the artificially high price of drugs and bring them down immediately.\par \par \uc2 Finally, the time has come to give Americans the freedom to purchase health insurance across State lines \u8212\'20\'14 creating a truly competitive national marketplace that will bring cost way down and provide far better care.\par \par \uc2 Everything that is broken in our country can be fixed. Every problem can be solved. And every hurting family can find healing, and hope.\par \par \uc2 Our citizens deserve this, and so much more \u8212\'20\'14 so why not join forces to finally get it done? On this and so many other things, Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of our country, and for the good of the American people.\par \par \uc2 My administration wants to work with members in both parties to make childcare accessible and affordable, to help ensure new parents have paid family leave, to invest in women's health, and to promote clean air and clear water, and to rebuild our military and our infrastructure.\par \par \uc2 True love for our people requires us to find common ground, to advance the common good, and to cooperate on behalf of every American child who deserves a brighter future.\par \par \uc2 An incredible young woman is with us this evening who should serve as an inspiration to us all.\par \par \uc2 Today is Rare Disease day, and joining us in the gallery is a Rare Disease Survivor, Megan Crowley. Megan was diagnosed with Pompe Disease, a rare and serious illness, when she was 15 months old. She was not expected to live past 5.\par \par \uc2 On receiving this news, Megan's dad, John, fought with everything he had to save the life of his precious child. He founded a company to look for a cure, and helped develop the drug that saved Megan's life. Today she is 20 years old \u8212\'20\'14 and a sophomore at Notre Dame.\par \par \uc2 Megan's story is about the unbounded power of a father's love for a daughter.\par \par \uc2 But our slow and burdensome approval process at the \uc2 Food and Drug Administration\uc2  keeps too many advances, like the one that saved Megan's life, from reaching those in need.\par \par \uc2 If we slash the restraints, not just at the \uc2 FDA\uc2  but across our Government, then we will be blessed with far more miracles like Megan.\par \par \uc2 In fact, our children will grow up in a Nation of miracles.\par \par \uc2 But to achieve this future, we must enrich the mind \u8212\'20\'14 and the souls \u8212\'20\'14 of every American child.\par \par \uc2 Education is the civil rights issue of our time.\par \par \uc2 I am calling upon Members of both parties to pass an education bill that funds school choice for disadvantaged youth, including millions of African-American and Latino children. These families should be free to choose the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school that is right for them.\par \par \uc2 Joining us tonight in the gallery is a remarkable woman, Denisha Merriweather. As a young girl, Denisha struggled in school and failed third grade twice. But then she was able to enroll in a private center for learning, with the help of a tax credit scholarship program. Today, she is the first in her family to graduate, not just from high school, but from college. Later this year she will get her masters degree in social work.\par \par \uc2 We want all children to be able to break the cycle of poverty just like Denisha.\par \par \uc2 But to break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of violence.\par \par \uc2 The murder rate in 2015 experienced its largest single-year increase in nearly half a century.\par \par \uc2 In Chicago, more than 4,000 people were shot last year alone \u8212\'20\'14 and the murder rate so far this year has been even higher.\par \par \uc2 This is not acceptable in our society.\par \par \uc2 Every American child should be able to grow up in a safe community, to attend a great school, and to have access to a high-paying job.\par \par \uc2 But to create this future, we must work with \u8212\'20\'14 not against \u8212\'20\'14 the men and women of law enforcement.\par \par \uc2 We must build bridges of cooperation and trust \u8212\'20\'14 not drive the wedge of disunity and division.\par \par \uc2 Police and sheriffs are members of our community. They are friends and neighbors, they are mothers and fathers, sons and daughters \u8212\'20\'14 and they leave behind loved ones every day who worry whether or not they'll come home safe and sound.\par \par \uc2 We must support the incredible men and women of law enforcement.\par \par \uc2 And we must support the victims of crime.\par \par \uc2 I have ordered the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2  to create an office to serve American Victims. The office is called VOICE \u8212\'20\'14 Victims Of Immigration Crime Engagement. We are providing a voice to those who have been ignored by our media, and silenced by special interests.\par \par \uc2 Joining us in the audience tonight are four very brave Americans whose government failed them.\par \par \uc2 Their names are Jamiel Shaw, Susan Oliver, Jenna Oliver, and Jessica Davis.\par \par \uc2 Jamiel's 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  gang member, who had just been released from prison. Jamiel Shaw Jr. was an incredible young man, with unlimited potential who was getting ready to go to college where he would have excelled as a great quarterback. But he never got the chance. His father, who is in the audience tonight, has become a good friend of mine.\par \par \uc2 Also with us are Susan Oliver and Jessica Davis. Their husbands -- Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver and Detective Michael Davis \u8212\'20\'14 were slain in the line of duty in California. They were pillars of their community. These brave men were viciously gunned down by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  with a criminal record and two prior deportations.\par \par \uc2 Sitting with Susan is her daughter, Jenna. Jenna: I want you to know that your father was a hero, and that tonight you have the love of an entire country supporting you and praying for you.\par \par \uc2 To Jamiel, Jenna, Susan and Jessica: I want you to know \u8212\'20\'14 we will never stop fighting for justice. Your loved ones will never be forgotten, we will always honor their memory.\par \par \uc2 Finally, to keep America Safe we must provide the men and women of the United States military with the tools they need to prevent war and \u8212\'20\'14 if they must \u8212\'20\'14 to fight and to win.\par \par \uc2 I am sending the Congress a budget that rebuilds the military, eliminates the Defense sequester, and calls for one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history.\par \par \uc2 My budget will also increase funding for our veterans.\par \par \uc2 Our veterans have delivered for this Nation \u8212\'20\'14 and now we must deliver for them.\par \par \uc2 The challenges we face as a Nation are great. But our people are even greater.\par \par \uc2 And none are greater or braver than those who fight for America in uniform.\par \par \uc2 We are blessed to be joined tonight by Carryn Owens, the widow of a U.S. Navy Special Operator, Senior Chief William "Ryan" Owens. Ryan died as he lived: a warrior, and a hero \u8212\'20\'14 battling against terrorism and securing our Nation.\par \par \uc2 I just spoke to General Mattis, who reconfirmed that, and I quote, "Ryan was a part of a highly successful raid that generated large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many more victories in the future against our enemies." Ryan's legacy is etched into eternity. For as the Bible teaches us, there is no greater act of love than to lay down one's life for one's friends. Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country, and for our freedom \u8212\'20\'14 we will never forget him.\par \par \uc2 To those allies who wonder what kind of friend America will be, look no further than the heroes who wear our uniform.\par \par \uc2 Our foreign policy calls for a direct, robust and meaningful engagement with the world. It is American leadership based on vital security interests that we share with our allies across the globe.\par \par \uc2 We strongly support \uc2 NATO\uc2  , an alliance forged through the bonds of two World Wars that dethroned fascism, and a Cold War that defeated communism.\par \par \uc2 But our partners must meet their financial obligations.\par \par \uc2 And now, based on our very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that.\par \par \uc2 We expect our partners, whether in \uc2 NATO\uc2  , in the Middle East, or the Pacific \u8212\'20\'14 to take a direct and meaningful role in both strategic and military operations, and pay their fair share of the cost.\par \par \uc2 We will respect historic institutions, but we will also respect the sovereign rights of nations.\par \par \uc2 Free nations are the best vehicle for expressing the will of the people \u8212\'20\'14 and America respects the right of all nations to chart their own path. My job is not to represent the world. My job is to represent the United States of America. But we know that America is better off, when there is less conflict \u8212\'20\'14 not more.\par \par \uc2 We must learn from the mistakes of the past \u8212\'20\'14 we have seen the war and destruction that have raged across our world.\par \par \uc2 The only long-term solution for these humanitarian disasters is to create the conditions where displaced persons can safely return home and begin the long process of rebuilding.\par \par \uc2 America is willing to find new friends, and to forge new partnerships, where shared interests align. We want harmony and stability, not war and conflict.\par \par \uc2 We want peace, wherever peace can be found. America is friends today with former enemies. Some of our closest allies, decades ago, fought on the opposite side of these World Wars. This history should give us all faith in the possibilities for a better world.\par \par \uc2 Hopefully, the 250th year for America will see a world that is more peaceful, more just and more free.\par \par \uc2 On our 100th anniversary, in 1876, citizens from across our Nation came to Philadelphia to celebrate America's centennial. At that celebration, the country's builders and artists and inventors showed off their creations.\par \par \uc2 Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time.\par \par \uc2 Remington unveiled the first typewriter. An early attempt was made at electric light.\par \par \uc2 Thomas Edison\uc2  showed an automatic telegraph and an electric pen.\par \par \uc2 Imagine the wonders our country could know in America's 250th year.\par \par \uc2 Think of the marvels we can achieve if we simply set free the dreams of our people.\par \par \uc2 Cures to illnesses that have always plagued us are not too much to hope.\par \par \uc2 American footprints on distant worlds are not too big a dream.\par \par \uc2 Millions lifted from welfare to work is not too much to expect.\par \par \uc2 And streets where mothers are safe from fear \u8212\'20\'14 schools where children learn in peace \u8212\'20\'14 and jobs where Americans prosper and grow \u8212\'20\'14 are not too much to ask.\par \par \uc2 When we have all of this, we will have made America greater than ever before. For all Americans.\par \par \uc2 This is our vision. This is our mission.\par \par \uc2 But we can only get there together.\par \par \uc2 We are one people, with one destiny.\par \par \uc2 We all bleed the same blood.\par \par \uc2 We all salute the same flag.\par \par \uc2 And we are all made by the same God.\par \par \uc2 And when we fulfill this vision; when we celebrate our 250 years of glorious freedom, we will look back on tonight as when this new chapter of American Greatness began.\par \par \uc2 The time for small thinking is over. The time for trivial fights is behind us.\par \par \uc2 We just need the courage to share the dreams that fill our hearts.\par \par \uc2 The bravery to express the hopes that stir our souls.\par \par \uc2 And the confidence to turn those hopes and dreams to action.\par \par \uc2 From now on, America will be empowered by our aspirations, not burdened by our fears \u8212\'20\'14 inspired by the future, not bound by the failures of the past \u8212\'20\'14 and guided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts.\par \par \uc2 I am asking all citizens to embrace this Renewal of the American Spirit. I am asking all members of Congress to join me in dreaming big, and bold and daring things for our country. And I am asking everyone watching tonight to seize this moment and \u8212\'20\'14 believe in yourselves.\par \par \uc2 Believe in your future.\par \par \uc2 And believe, once more, in America.\par \par \uc2 Thank you, God bless you, and God bless these United States.\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020170301ed31002ky\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (AP) \u8212\'20\'14 Alexander Salgado shouldn't have killed 16-year-old Jasmine Guevara.\par \par \uc2 He shouldn't have even been in the country, according to South Dakota's top prosecutor, the Argus Leader ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://argusne.ws/2lqSrkK"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://argusne.ws/2lqSrkK}}}\uc2  ) reported.\par \par \uc2 Attorney General Marty Jackley's views on immigration were significantly shaped by the 2009 case, in which the immigrant living in the U.S. illegally pleaded guilty to second-degree murder. Jackley has generally supported President \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 's tougher stance on immigration, and that support stems in large part from the Salgado case, one of the state's most brutal murders in recent memory.\par \par \uc2 Salgado admitted to helping his then girlfriend Maricela Diaz slit Guevara's throat and leave the teen to burn alive in the trunk of a car in a Hansen County field. He is currently serving life in prison without parole.\par \par \uc2 A native of Guerrero, Mexico, Salgado had ties to Mexican drug cartels, and before his arrest in South Dakota, was suspected in a series of crimes in Fort Wayne, Indiana.\par \par \uc2 "He was being held in a holding facility in Indiana and they let him go," Jackley said. "There was a little girl here in South Dakota that was harmed, and that could have been prevented on the federal side had they done their jobs."\par \par \uc2 To Jackley, the case underscores the need for federal immigration reform. A more comprehensive approach to immigration, he said, might have prevented Salgado from coming to South Dakota and killing Guevara.\par \par \uc2 "There's always been a recognition of the need for a proper vetting procedure that will not only make America safe, but would also be a supplement to our workforce," Jackley said. "When it's not done, we are left with situations like the Salgado case."\par \par \uc2 The following year, Jackley backed Arizona after it was sued by the federal government for a bill its governor signed giving police the power to question anyone who they had reasonable suspicion of being an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . And in 2014, he was among the attorneys general and governors who sued the federal government over former President Obama's order offering temporary legal status to millions of immigrants living in the U.S. illegally.\par \par \uc2 His frustration is amplified by another case in which he was unable to protect victims and witnesses from deportation after they testified in a human trafficking case.\par \par \uc2 In his previous role as U.S. Attorney, he prosecuted Robert John Farrell and his wife, Angelita Magat Farrell, who were convicted by a federal jury in November 2007 after hearing from four victims who had been treated as modern-day slaves by the couple. The Farrells first committed visa fraud to bring Philippine workers into the United States, then chained them to the cleaning and front desk duties at the hotel they owned in Oacoma.\par \par \uc2 Jackley's office tried to secure visas for cooperating witnesses and victims, but the attempts were unsuccessful. The workers fell into the hands of the federal Immigration Custom and Enforcement. It's unclear whether the victims returned to the Philippines.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 Information from: Argus Leader, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.argusleader.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.argusleader.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020170301ed3100jit\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Here are excerpts from recent editorials in Texas newspapers:\par \par \uc2 The Monitor. Feb. 12, 2017.\par \par \uc2 Anyone who has ever sat through Hidalgo County Commissioner's Court has probably noted this about Hidalgo County Judge Ramon Garcia: He asks a lot of questions. Usually he is calm and non-threatening. And most often, he already knows the answers.\par \par \uc2 But his signature probing is not only artful courtroom decorum that only a veteran politician can pull off, but to the public and those of us in the media, it has allowed an important element of transparency into Hidalgo County Commissioner's Court. At times, it's as if he's leading us all, like witnesses, to know what issues are of importance, when we should hear an explanation to decipher for ourselves whether a program is warranted, and to witness for ourselves when items are clearly not well-vetted or worthy of taxpayer funds.\par \par \uc2 He's done much of this for the past 10 years with a steady gaze, friendly smile and ever controlling hand.\par \par \uc2 And when Hidalgo County Judge Ramon Garcia steps down at the end of 2018, it will be an end of an era for politics in South Texas as we know it. His style and demeanor will be missed.\par \par \uc2 Garcia, 68, has told The Monitor that he has decided not to run for a fourth term. He wants time off to mentor to his son, who also is a lawyer, and has recently joined his McAllen law firm.\par \par \uc2 "I have been given the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity of welcoming my son, Orlando, to the firm and I look forward to practicing law with him by my side," Garcia said.\par \par \uc2 Not having him by our sides every second Tuesday of the month for commissioner's meetings, will feel odd for courthouse watchers. His departure will undoubtedly upend the staffing of many county agency directors, budgetary priorities and afford an opportunity for a new crop of county leaders to step in and take over.\par \par \uc2 We commend Garcia for giving notice so early in his term \u8212\'20\'14 with 23 months to go \u8212\'20\'14 to allow the competitive bidding for his job, which pays a $114,660 annual salary. Names of several candidates already have been bantered about, including former County Judge Eloy Pulido, Hidalgo County Clerk Arturo Guajardo Jr., Precinct 4 County Commissioner Joseph Palacios and Pharr Mayor Dr. Ambrosio Hernandez.\par \par \uc2 With Garcia's recent announcement, we expect to soon see the positioning for campaign funds and support by many for this coveted leadership spot.\par \par \uc2 When he steps down, Garcia will have been at the helm of this county for 12 years \u8212\'20\'14 the second-longest of any county judge since the early 1970s, and by far the longest in our modern era.\par \par \uc2 He has overseen thousands of employees who provide services to over 775,000 residents in Hidalgo County \u8212\'20\'14 the eighth-most populous county in Texas, which spans over 1,500 square miles.\par \par \uc2 And throughout his tenure, Judge Garcia has served as a steadfast diplomat and stalwart promoter for the Rio Grande Valley and South Texas.\par \par \uc2 He has brought dignitaries from throughout the United States and other countries here to see how our commerce and way of life on the border contributes to not only our region, but our state, and our nation, overall.\par \par \uc2 He has promoted open borders and commerce and the importance of the \uc2 North American Free Trade Agreement\uc2 , as well as helped to secure hundreds of thousands of dollars of federal and state funds for local law enforcement to help U.S. Border Patrol and \uc2 U.S. Customs and Border Protection\uc2  keep our border region safe.\par \par \uc2 He has helped to develop higher education institutions in the RGV, such as South Texas College, the formation of the \uc2 University of Texas Rio Grande Valley\uc2 , and the UTRGV School of Medicine, and Texas A&M University, which will be opening a campus in North McAllen.\par \par \uc2 And if you give him the chance, he'll likely tell you (with a chuckle and a smile) that he did this all without raising local taxes.\par \par \uc2 Keeping taxes down (yet not necessarily keeping local property appraisals low) has been a goal of Garcia \u8212\'20\'14 one he has openly touted, like he did when he announced his surprise retirement from office.\par \par \uc2 "In 2002, when I was elected to my first term in office, the county was in poor financial shape. Taxes had skyrocketed from 44 cents to 59 cents and our fund balance was at an all-time low of $702,648. Today, our fund balance is at about $29 million, taxes have not gone up in 15 years," Garcia said.\par \par \uc2 It's no surprise that another longtime goal of his has been the construction of a new county courthouse \u8212\'20\'14 with, or without, voter approval. Through creative financial maneuvering, Garcia's staff has been able to pay down debt and, they tell us, are able to afford and absorb the costs of a $150 million facility without raising taxes or buying new bonds (which would require voter approval).\par \par \uc2 He often hears earfuls against his construction plans by members of the Objective Watchers of the Legal System (OWLS) who attend most every commissioner's court wearing their signature red shirts and blazing full of questions and comments. They also openly ridiculed (and still do) his support for a Hidalgo County Healthcare District, which was overwhelmingly defeated by voters last November.\par \par \uc2 Yet, as OWLS Founder Virginia Townsend told us, despite their differences of opinion, Garcia rarely gets rattled.\par \par \uc2 "He doesn't get offended. I meet with him when I can. Sometimes we have lunch and I tell him the things I don't like or I think that's going on, and he always listens. But that doesn't mean he always does something about it, but we work it out," Townsend said.\par \par \uc2 Garcia has shown so much respect for Townsend that in public he has even responded to her from the dais during public comment periods \u8212\'20\'14 a time when citizens may sound off on an issue but commissioners do not engage back. He's even asked her questions and solicited her advice.\par \par \uc2 That's the true trademark of an elder statesman \u8212\'20\'14 one who is not afraid of probing all sides in public, and even showing humility and vulnerability and asking for help from those who openly oppose you.\par \par \uc2 Townsend, like many, told us she was "very surprised" that Garcia was stepping down and warns that whoever decides to run "better have plenty of money."\par \par \uc2 We expect the 2018 primary election to have a crowded field with many outspoken voices and candidates who we hope will not follow the follies of this past presidential election and will refrain from engaging in nasty recourse and unseemly public dialogue about one another.\par \par \uc2 It will be the dawn of a new era in politics in Hidalgo County \u8212\'20\'14 one void of Judge Garcia's gentle public manner and soft-spoken style.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 Corpus Christi Caller-Times. Feb. 13, 2017.\par \par \uc2 State lawmakers with an eye toward re-election are apt to brag about how far they'd go to further Texas' interests. But voters should consider with healthy skepticism whether subsidized trips to Turkey serve their interests.\par \par \uc2 Ten Texas lawmakers and 152 state lawmakers from 29 states toured Turkey between 2006 and 2015. Their sponsors were nonprofits associated with a Turkish opposition group accused by the Turkish government of being involved in an unsuccessful coup. The group's leader, Fethullah Gulen, is a longtime U.S. resident cleric who practices what is described as a friendly brand of Islam that embraces modern science.\par \par \uc2 The group, known as the Gulen movement, is involved in charter schools nationwide, including the School of Science and Technology in Corpus Christi. The schools provide jobs for Turkish nationals who relocate to the United States. They are the kind of educated workforce that immigration authorities should be encouraged to grant work visas. And the Corpus Christi school met state accountability standards. Many area traditional public schools wish they could claim the same.\par \par \uc2 The Gulen movement describes its generous outreach efforts to state-level politicians as an effort to foster goodwill and a better understanding of Turkish culture, which it says is part of Gulen's teachings.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, Gulen is the Turkish government's most wanted man. Turkey wants him extradited. That is not the purview of state-level lawmakers. But policies and funding for charter schools are a state-level decision.\par \par \uc2 We don't fault the Gulen movement for any of those connections. If anything, we're impressed at how astutely the movement has gone about extending its influence (and we don't mean "influence" in a bad way). Today's state-level lawmakers often end up in Congress. The Gulen movement appears to have gone about its movement in the good, old-fashioned American way. It's no different from a restaurateur offering to comp a police officer's meal. The restaurateur is just being friendly and supportive of law enforcement.\par \par \uc2 But the public officials on the receiving end of hospitable offers must meet a different standard. The police officer can find a polite way to say no but thanks. And state senators and representatives should do likewise with offers of international travel. But the laws of various states don't compel them. Texas, for example, allows fact-finding excursions. And, according to reports, plenty of interesting facts about Turkey, its culture and Islam are found on these trips.\par \par \uc2 Sen. Eddie Lucio, D-Brownsville, was among the Texas lawmakers who went to Turkey. And while the reasons to go are important to the Gulen movement, the bigger question is why was it important to him and his constituents. A trip to Monte Carlo, which by mere mention of the name sounds like a junket, might be easier to justify as a fact-finding excursion. The tip of the Texas coast, with Mexico so near, might be an attractive site for a casino.\par \par \uc2 We don't mean to single out Lucio. Among his other colleagues who visited Turkey and still are in the Legislature are Reps. Alma Allen, D-Houston, and Donna Howard-D-Austin, and Sen. Joan Huffman, R-Houston. Huffman helped orchestrate the gutting of the Public Integrity Unit that oversaw ethics investigations of state officials. All should share with their constituents the valuable facts and insights they gathered in Turkey and how those facts and insights might change their public policy decisions in ways that matter to their constituents.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 Victoria Advocate. Feb. 18, 2017.\par \par \uc2 Domestic violence touches so many facets of society. It knows no boundaries.\par \par \uc2 It can happen in young couples as well as those who have spent most of their lives together. It is in wealthy households as well as in the poor.\par \par \uc2 Many times it goes undetected by friends and family for a long time because there are no visible signs of abuse or the victim has gotten good at hiding the signs through clothing or avoiding social encounters.\par \par \uc2 And sadly, it can end in death.\par \par \uc2 The definition of domestic violence is simple enough \u8212\'20\'14 if a person is living with fear of harm or death, he or she is a victim of domestic abuse.\par \par \uc2 It is so much more prevalent than most people believe. On average four to six domestic violence cases are reported in Victoria a night, according to information from the Mid-Coast Family Services.\par \par \uc2 If you do the math, that is a staggering 1,460 to 2,190 cases a year that are reported to police in Victoria alone.\par \par \uc2 That number is hard to grasp. It is hard to even try to understand why a person would harm someone they love and share a life with.\par \par \uc2 But in the ugly reality of life, domestic abuse happens. Last year Mid-Coast Family Services worked with 800 people, mostly from the Crossroads, who were trying to escape an abusive home life \u8212\'20\'14 half of those sought shelter in the agency's shelter.\par \par \uc2 The Crossroads is fortunate to have the services of Mid-Coast Family Services to work with people who have been battered physically and emotionally.\par \par \uc2 The agency's contact with the victims starts with a phone call to its 24-hour hotline. The call is a huge step for the battered person to take to admit they are battered and want help getting away from the abuser.\par \par \uc2 But once that call is made, trained staff members go to work to help that person. The help can include counseling for the battered and their children, lining up free legal assistance, helping them line up housing, among other services.\par \par \uc2 But before Mid-Coast can do any of this, they have to have the money to keep their shelter open and have staff to help.\par \par \uc2 Mid-Coast is concerned it may not get enough funding from the state this legislative session to keep the entire shelter open.\par \par \uc2 At the beginning of the 2017 legislative session, agencies like Mid-Coast were told to expect a 10 percent cut in state funding because the budgetary coffers are tighter than last session.\par \par \uc2 Mid-Coast is asking for $220,000, even though their need is higher than that and continues to grow.\par \par \uc2 The agency gets funding from three sources \u8212\'20\'14 the state, fundraising and United Way of Victoria County.\par \par \uc2 The United Way\uc2  allocated $85,100 to Mid-Coast last year \u8212\'20\'14 the highest amount given to any one agency.\par \par \uc2 If the state funding is cut, chances are great that Mid-Coast would have to cut staffing and close one wing of the shelter. The home, which runs at 100 to 125 percent capacity on a regular basis, would not be able to serve as many people as they do now.\par \par \uc2 That option is not acceptable.\par \par \uc2 People who are trying to escape abusive relationships and make a better life for themselves, and in many cases their children, need a safe place to call home while they figure out what they need to do and transition into a new life.\par \par \uc2 To take that first step to escape an abusive relationship and seek help takes tremendous courage and strength.\par \par \uc2 Crossroads residents can support those brave people, who are most of the time women with children, by contacting their state representative and state senator and simply say cutting funding to such vital programs is not acceptable.\par \par \uc2 We are confident that as the legislators are buried with letters, emails and phone calls supporting Mid-Coast and similar programs across the state, they will see that fully funding these agencies is the humane thing to do.\par \par \uc2 By the community stepping up to give its support, the funding received may save the life of a friend, neighbor or family member who is able to escape an abusive relationship and start anew.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 The Eagle. Feb. 19, 2017.\par \par \uc2 Immigrants, particularly those without the proper documentation, have become easy targets in recent years and the election of \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  as president has increased unrest toward those who weren't born here.\par \par \uc2 Let's be up front: We would prefer that people come to this country legally and with all the proper documentation. At the same time, we understand that many of the immigrants from other countries do not have the required paperwork, but still they come.\par \par \uc2 They come because America is \u8212\'20\'14 and always has been \u8212\'20\'14 a shining beacon of hope. From the earliest European settlers in America, people have come here to build a better life for themselves and their families. That our ancestors did \u8212\'20\'14 and we and the country are better for it. For generations, immigrants have helped build our buildings, construct our railroads, fight our wars, grow our food, educate our children, shape our future.\par \par \uc2 At the battle of Fredericksburg in Virginia in December 1862, Union troops who immigrated from Ireland brutally fought Confederate troops who immigrated from Ireland. In World War II, descendants of immigrants from Japan fought bravely for America throughout Europe and North Africa. Right here in the Brazos Valley, immigrants from Germany and Italy and Czechoslovakia and other countries built the foundation that makes us strong.\par \par \uc2 Yet, in recent years, many politicians and politically motivated groups have demonized immigrants, particularly illegal immigrants. They are freeloaders we are told, placing huge demands on our schools, our health care system, our social structure. In short, they take, take, take, stealing jobs from American workers, committing crimes, voting illegally, and not paying taxes. That sounds dire, and if it were true, it would be.\par \par \uc2 In fact, illegal immigrants do pay taxes \u8212\'20\'14 lots of them. Many pay Social Security taxes, although they likely never will see any of that money in "retirement." Like the rest of us, they pay sales taxes when they purchase food and goods. Wherever they live, illegal immigrants pay property taxes, either directly or through rent on the places they live.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Social Security Administration\uc2  estimates that undocumented workers have contributed some 10 percent of the Social Security Trust Fund. In 2007, the nonpartisan \uc2 Congressional Budget Office\uc2  said, "Over the past two decades, most efforts to estimate the fiscal impact of immigration in the United States have concluded that, in aggregate and over the long term, tax revenues of all types generated by immigrants \u8212\'20\'14 both legal and unauthorized \u8212\'20\'14 exceed the cost of the services they use."\par \par \uc2 The government estimates that 53 percent of farm workers are undocumented; other sources including growers put that number at 70 percent. Our agriculture producers could employ only American citizens and documented immigrants, but they would have to pay a lot higher wages and that would drive the cost of the food we eat to skyrocket.\par \par \uc2 In 2006, a group of some 500 business leaders wrote President George W. Bush, saying, "While a small percentage of native-born Americans may be harmed by immigration, vastly more Americans benefit from the contributions that immigrants make to our economy, including lower consumer prices."\par \par \uc2 And as for voting, it is possible a few \u8212\'20\'14 a very few \u8212\'20\'14 undocumented immigrants have cast ballots, but it is unlikely it is any appreciable number. The last thing an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  wants to do is interact with the government at the ballot box or any place. State voting officials, Republican and Democrat, unanimously agree that such voter fraud just doesn't happen.\par \par \uc2 President Barack Obama's administration actively sought to deport undocumented aliens, sending a record-setting 2.5 million people back to their homes. Now, President Trump apparently is seeking to outdo his predecessor. Recent raids by \uc2 Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2  officers have deported numerous individuals and arrested many more in preparation for deporting them. Among those rounded up are mothers of young children \u8212\'20\'14 mothers who have lived in America for decades \u8212\'20\'14 and people who came here as preteens and have gotten an education and worked hard to make America greater.\par \par \uc2 We aren't saying America should ignore those who come here without documentation. But especially here in Texas, we know the importance of these immigrants to our state's economy. As the nation goes about trying to determine how to deal with illegal immigration, it is important to remember that immigrants should be treated with dignity and respect. Basic humanity requires it.\par \par \uc2 If a few of those who come to America commit crimes beyond their undocumented status, treat them as we would any other criminal.\par \par \uc2 For the rest, let's have a national discussion on how to deal with the millions who are here and are contributing members of American society.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 The Dallas Morning News. Feb. 20, 2017.\par \par \uc2 Even if you're sure you'll never buy property from the City of Dallas Land Bank, here's why you should care that it operates as efficiently and effectively as possible:\par \par \uc2 Your tax dollars are paying for the city to mow and maintain thousands of land-bank-eligible vacant and abandoned properties. And as long as those lots sit idle, they aren't contributing a penny toward reducing your own tax bill.\par \par \uc2 It's as if these derelict lots \u8212\'20\'14 the vast majority of them in the southern half of the city \u8212\'20\'14 are double-billing Dallas and its taxpayers.\par \par \uc2 That's why City Manager T.C. Broadnax and his team must not stop at simply strengthening land bank rules to prevent potential abuses. In a city where revenue is needed and needed badly, the new boss at 1500 Marilla would be smart to look at how the operation can do far more quality deals.\par \par \uc2 Lots of questions have buzzed around the land bank since a Dallas Morning News investigation last December revealed that a West Dallas businessman with a construction-related felony conviction purchased land bank lots and then played loose with its guidelines.\par \par \uc2 Since 2012, Jose Santos Coria has bought three dozen vacant lots for $5,000 each in exchange for his promise to build affordable homes. In four years, he sold just 11 houses. Four went to two of his sons, a daughter and a grandson.\par \par \uc2 In response to the troublesome details uncovered about Coria's dealings, various City Council members have endorsed several modest moves to prevent future land-bank abuses.\par \par \uc2 We agree with all those ideas, which we've listed at the end of this editorial.\par \par \uc2 Additionally, while criminal or financial history should not immediately bar a builder from the land bank program, we believe such information must be disclosed. The city staff needs to produce a uniform policy for how both housing and economic development handles this vetting.\par \par \uc2 Broadnax has pledged that he'll return to the City Council within three months with a revamped land-bank operation. We're betting he'll strengthen program parameters as well as shore up the sometimes-sloppy administration of this housing department program.\par \par \uc2 Used correctly, the land bank is a powerful, and rare, tool that can force accountability on Dallas' epidemic of vacant and abandoned property. We're not talking just about empty lots but about vacant properties where structures \u8212\'20\'14 often dilapidated crime magnets \u8212\'20\'14 teeter.\par \par \uc2 The land bank can turn a costly liability to the city \u8212\'20\'14 mowing bills alone run into the millions annually \u8212\'20\'14 into a revenue-producing property. And because 90 percent of these lots exist in disenfranchised neighborhoods, new development lifts up communities that are most in need.\par \par \uc2 So while Broadnax scrubs the rules, we hope he also will see ways to pick up the pace of land bank transfers and aggressively bring more properties back to life.\par \par \uc2 Among the changes that Council members asked City Manager T.C. Broadnax to evaluate, we support the following:\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 Verify income requirements for homebuyers to make sure they qualify.\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 Disclose home sales to relatives.\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 Prohibit sales to homebuyers who already own property.\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 Require that homebuyer live in the home for at least five years.\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 Stipulate time frame to get a house built, ranging from 18 months to three years.\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020170228ed2s00nx5\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) \u8212\'20\'14 Democrats have tapped former Gov. Steve Beshear to deliver the party's response to President \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 's address to a joint session of Congress Tuesday night, highlighting the Kentucky Democrat's efforts to expand health care coverage under the law Republicans are determined to repeal and replace.\par \par \uc2 Senate Minority Leader \uc2 Chuck Schumer\uc2 , D-N.Y., and House Minority Leader \uc2 Nancy Pelosi\uc2 , D-Calif., made the announcement on Friday in which they also turned to immigration activist Astrid Silva to give the Spanish language response to Trump's speech. Silva is a so-called Dreamer who came to the country at the age of five as an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Silva spoke at the Democratic convention and her selection is a reminder of Trump's initial policies on immigration. While the Trump administration has cracked down on immigrants living in the country illegally, Trump has said he wants to spare the children.\par \par \uc2 Democrats' choice of Beshear as Tuesday's counterpoint to Trump underscored their desire to stress their support for former President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 's health care overhaul, which recent polling suggests is increasingly popular among Americans. It also comes as Republican leaders labor to craft a plan for replacing that law they can push through Congress \u8212\'20\'14 a problem that may have only intensified after GOP lawmakers held town hall meetings this week attended by boisterous backers of Obama's statute.\par \par \uc2 Beshear, now 72, served as Kentucky governor from 2007 to 2015. He embraced Obama's 2010 health care law and expanded the Medicaid program to cover around 400,000 Kentuckians, dropping the percentage of the state's uninsured people from over 20 percent to 7.5 percent, one of the nation's steepest reductions.\par \par \uc2 At a time when Democrats are trying to figure out how to reconnect with middle American voters who were crucial to Trump's election victory in November, Beshear gives the party a face from that part of the country. He's also from the same state as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who easily defeated Beshear when the Democrat challenged him in 1996 and is at the forefront of efforts to repeal the health care law.\par \par \uc2 "American families desperately need our president to put his full attention on creating opportunity and good-paying jobs and preserving their right to affordable health care and a quality education," Beshear said in a statement. "Real leaders don't spread derision and division \u8212\'20\'14 they build partnerships and offer solutions instead of ideology and blame."\par \par \uc2 Republicans have repeatedly criticized the law as too costly and vowed to repeal and replace Obama's overhaul.\par \par \uc2 House Republicans hope to roll out legislation in coming weeks to replace major elements of the Affordable Care Act with a new system involving tax credits, health savings accounts and high risk pools, but crucial details remain unknown.\par \par \uc2 Beshear's successor, Republican Gov. Matt Bevin, has asked the federal government to let Kentucky change its expanded Medicaid program. He's said he would repeal the expansion if he's not given permission to reshape it.\par \par \uc2 Bevin has said the existing program is too costly and he wants to require most recipients to pay monthly premiums and have jobs or volunteer for a charity to stay eligible for benefits.\par \par \uc2 Silva moved to Nevada as a child and contact with former Sen. Harry Reid helped to transform her into an immigration activist.\par \par \uc2 "President Trump would have people believe that all immigrants are criminals and that refugees are terrorists," Silva said in a statement. "But like my family, the vast majority of immigrants and refugees came to this country escaping poverty and conflict, looking for a better life and the opportunity to reach the American Dream."\par \par \uc2 FILE - In this Dec. 1, 2015 file photo, then-Kentucky Governor Steve Beshear speaks in Louisville, Ky.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 President \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  defended his presidency, slammed reports that his campaign advisers had inappropriate contact with Russian officials and promised to crack down on the leaking of classified information in a news conference Thursday at the White House. Here is the full transcript:\par \par \uc2 ____\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Thank you very much.\par \par \uc2 I just wanted to begin by mentioning that the nominee for secretary of the Department of Labor will be Mr. Alex Acosta. He has a law degree from Harvard Law School, was a great student; former clerk for Justice Samuel Alito. And he has had a tremendous career. He's a member and has been a member of the \uc2 National Labor Relations Board\uc2 , and has been through Senate confirmation three times, confirmed; did very, very well.\par \par \uc2 And so Alex, I've wished him the best. We just spoke. And he's going to be -- I think he'll be a tremendous secretary of labor.\par \par \uc2 And also as you probably heard just a little while ago, Mick Mulvaney, former congressman, has just been approved weeks late, I have to say that, weeks, weeks late, Office of Management and Budget. And he will be I think a fantastic addition.\par \par \uc2 Paul Singer\uc2  just left. As you know, Paul was very much involved with the anti-Trump or as they say, "never Trump." And Paul just left and he's given us his total support. And it's all about unification. We're unifying the party and hopefully we're going to be able to unify the country. It's very important to me. I've been talking about that for a long time. It's very, very important to me.\par \par \uc2 So I want to thank \uc2 Paul Singer\uc2  for being here and for coming up to the office. He was a very strong opponent, and now he's a very strong ally. And I appreciate that.\par \par \uc2 I think I'll say a few words, and then we'll take some questions. And I had this time. We've been negotiating a lot of different transactions to save money on contracts that were terrible, including airplane contracts that were out of control and late and terrible; just absolutely catastrophic in terms of what was happening. And we've done some really good work. We're very proud of that.\par \par \uc2 And then right after that, you prepare yourselves, we'll do some questions, unless you have enough questions. That's always a possibility.\par \par \uc2 I'm here today to update the American people on the incredible progress that has been made in the last four weeks since my inauguration. We have made incredible progress. I don't think there's ever been a president elected who in this short period of time has done what we've done.\par \par \uc2 A new Rasmussen poll, in fact -- because the people get it -- much of the media doesn't get it. They actually get it, but they don't write it. Let's put it that way. But a new Rasmussen poll just came out just a very short while ago, and it has our approval rating at 55 percent and going up. The stock market has hit record numbers, as you know. And there has been a tremendous surge of optimism in the business world, which is -- to me means something much different than it used to. It used to mean, "Oh, that's good." Now it means, "That's good for jobs." Very different.\par \par \uc2 Plants and factories are already starting to move back into the United States, and big league -- \uc2 Ford\uc2 , \uc2 General Motors\uc2 , so many of them. I'm making this presentation directly to the American people, with the media present, which is an honor to have you.\par \par \uc2 This morning, because many of our nation's reporters and folks will not tell you the truth, and will not treat the wonderful people of our country with the respect that they deserve. And I hope going forward we can be a little bit -- a little bit different, and maybe get along a little bit better, if that's possible. Maybe it's not, and that's OK, too.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Unfortunately, much of the media in Washington, D.C., along with New York, Los Angeles in particular, speaks not for the people, but for the special interests and for those profiting off a very, very obviously broken system. The press has become so dishonest that if we don't talk about, we are doing a tremendous disservice to the American people. Tremendous disservice. We have to talk to find out what's going on, because the press honestly is out of control. The level of dishonesty is out of control.\par \par \uc2 I ran for president to present the citizens of our country. I am here to change the broken system so it serves their families and their communities well. I am talking -- and really talking on this very entrenched power structure, and what we're doing is we're talking about the power structure; we're talking about its entrenchment. As a result, the media is going through what they have to go through too often times distort - not all the time - and some of the media is fantastic, I have to say - they're honest and fantastic.\par \par \uc2 But much of it is not a - the distortion -- and we'll talk about it, you'll be able to ask me questions about it. But we're not going to let it happen, because I'm here again, to take my message straight to the people. As you know, our administration inherited many problems across government and across the economy. To be honest, I inherited a mess. It's a mess. At home and abroad, a mess. Jobs are pouring out of the country; you see what's going on with all of the companies leaving our country, going to Mexico and other places, low pay, low wages, mass instability overseas, no matter where you look. The middle east is a disaster. North Korea - we'll take care of it folks; we're going to take care of it all. I just want to let you know, I inherited a mess.\par \par \uc2 Beginning on day one, our administration went to work to tackle these challenges. On foreign affairs, we've already begun enormously productive talks with many foreign leaders, much of it you've covered, to move forward towards stability, security and peace in the most troubled regions of the world, which there are many. We have had great conversations with the United Kingdom, and meetings. Israel, Mexico, Japan, China and Canada, really, really productive conversations. I would say far more productive than you would understand.\par \par \uc2 We've even developed a new council with Canada to promote women's business leaders and entrepreneurs. It's very important to me, very important to my daughter Ivanka. I have directed our defense community headed by our great general, now Secretary Mattis. He's over there now working very hard to submit a plan for the defeat of ISIS, a group that celebrates the murder and torture of innocent people in large sections of the world. It used to be a small group, now it's in large sections of the world.\par \par \uc2 They've spread like cancer. ISIS has spread like cancer - another mess I inherited. And we have imposed new sanctions on the nation of Iran, whose totally taken advantage of our previous administration, and they're the world's top sponsor of terrorism, and we're not going to stop until that problem is properly solved. And it's not properly solved now, it's one of the worst agreements I've ever seen drawn by anybody. I've ordered plan to begin building for the massive rebuilding of the United States military. Had great support from the Senate, I've had great from Congress, generally.\par \par \uc2 We've pursued this rebuilding in the hopes that we will never have to use this military, and I will tell you that is my - I would be so happy if we never had to use it. But our country will never have had a military like the military we're about to build and rebuild. We have the greatest people on earth in our military, but they don't have the right equipment and their equipment is old. I used it; I talked about it at every stop. Depleted, it's depleted - it won't be depleted for long. And I think one of the reason I'm standing here instead of other people is that frankly, I talked about we have to have a strong military.\par \par \uc2 We have to have a strong law enforcement also. So we do not go abroad in the search of war, we really are searching for peace, but its peace through strength. At home, we have begun the monumental task of returning the government back to the people on a scale not seen in many, many years. In each of these actions, I'm keeping my promises to the American people. These are campaign promises. Some people are so surprised that we're having strong borders.\par \par \uc2 Well, that's what I've been talking about for a year and a half, strong borders. They're so surprised, oh, he having strong borders, well that's what I've been talking about to the press and to everybody else. One promise after another after years of politicians lying to you to get elected. They lied to the American people in order to get elected. Some of the things I'm doing probably aren't popular but they're necessary for security and for other reasons.\par \par \uc2 And then coming to Washington and pursuing their own interests which is more important to many politicians. I'm here following through on what I pledged to do. That's all I'm doing. I put it out before the American people, got 306 electoral college votes. I wasn't supposed to get 222. They said there's no way to get 222, 230's impossible.\par \par \uc2 270 which you need, that was laughable. We got 306 because people came out and voted like they've never seen before so that's the way it goes. I guess it was the biggest electoral college win since Ronald Reagan. In other words, the media's trying to attack our administration because they know we are following through on pledges that we made and they're not happy about it for whatever reason.\par \par \uc2 And - but a lot of people are happy about it. In fact, I'll be in Melbourne, Florida five o'clock on Saturday and I heard - just heard that the crowds are massive that want to be there. I turn on the T.V., open the newspapers and I see stories of chaos. Chaos. Yet it is the exact opposite. This administration is running like a fine- tuned machine, despite the fact that I can't get my cabinet approved.\par \par \uc2 And they're outstanding people like Senator Dan Coats who's there, one of the most respected men of the Senate. He can't get approved. How do you not approve him? He's been a colleague - highly respected. Brilliant guy, great guy, everybody knows it. We're waiting for approval. So we have a wonderful group of people that's working very hard, that's being very much misrepresented about and we can't let that happen.\par \par \uc2 So, if the Democrats who have - all you have to do is look at where they are right now. The only thing they can do is delay because they screwed things up royally, believe me. Let me list to you some of the things that we've done in just a short period of time. I just got here. And I got here with no cabinet. Again, each of these actions is a promise I made to the American people.\par \par \uc2 I'll go over just some of them and we have a lot happening next week and in the weeks - in the weeks coming. We've withdrawn from the job-killing disaster known as Trans Pacific Partnership. We're going to make trade deals but we're going to have one on one deals, bilateral. We're going to have one on one deals.\par \par \uc2 We've directed the elimination of regulations that undermine manufacturing and call for expedited approval of the permits needed for America and American infrastructure and that means plant, equipment, roads, bridges, factories. People take 10, 15, 20 years to get disapproved for a factory. They go in for a permit, it's many, many years. And then at the end of the process -- they spend 10s of millions of dollars on nonsense and at the end of the process, they get rejected.\par \par \uc2 Now, they may be rejected with me but it's going to be a quick rejection. Not going to take years. But mostly it's going to be an acceptance. We want plants built and we want factories built and we want the jobs. We don't want the jobs going to other countries. We've imposed a hiring freeze on non-essential federal workers. We've imposed a temporary moratorium on new federal regulations.\par \par \uc2 We've issued a game-changing new rule that says for each one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated. Makes sense. Nobody's ever seen regulations like we have. You go to other countries and you look at indexes (ph) they have and you say "let me see your regulations" and they're fraction, just a tiny fraction of what we have. And I want regulations because I want safety, I want environmental - all environmental situations to be taken properly care of. It's very important to me. But you don't need four or five or six regulations to take care of the same thing.\par \par \uc2 We've stood up for the men and women of law enforcement, directing federal agencies to ensure they are protected from crimes of violence. We've directed the creation of a task force for reducing violent crime in America, including the horrendous situation -- take a look at Chicago and others, taking place right now in our inner cities. Horrible.\par \par \uc2 We've ordered the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2  and Justice to coordinate on a plan to destroy criminal cartels coming into the United States with drugs. We're becoming a drug infested nation. Drugs are becoming cheaper than candy bars. We are not going to let it happen any longer.\par \par \uc2 We've undertaken the most substantial border security measures in a generation to keep our nation and our tax dollars safe. And are now in the process of beginning to build a promised wall on the southern border, met with general -- now Secretary Kelly yesterday and we're starting that process. And the wall is going to be a great wall and it's going to be a wall negotiated by me. The price is going to come down just like it has on everything else I've negotiated for the government. And we are going to have a wall that works, not gonna have a wall like they have now which is either non-existent or a joke.\par \par \uc2 We've ordered a crackdown on sanctuary cities that refuse to comply with federal law and that harbor criminal aliens, and we have ordered an end to the policy of catch and release on the border. No more release. No matter who you are, release. We have begun a nationwide effort to remove criminal aliens, gang members, drug dealers and others who pose a threat to public safety. We are saving American lives every single day.\par \par \uc2 The court system has not made it easy for us. And are even creating a new office in Homeland Security dedicated to the forgotten American victims of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  violence, which there are many. We have taken decisive action to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of our country. No parts are necessary and constitutional actions were blocked by judges, in my opinion, incorrect, and unsafe ruling. Our administration is working night and day to keep you safe, including reporters safe. And is vigorously defending this lawful order.\par \par \uc2 I will not back down from defending our country. I got elected on defense of our country. I keep my campaign promises, and our citizens will be very happy when they see the result. They already are, I can tell you that. Extreme vetting will be put in place and it already is in place in many places.\par \par \uc2 In fact, we had to go quicker than we thought because of the bad decision we received from a circuit that has been overturned at a record number. I have heard 80 percent, I find that hard to believe, that is just a number I heard, that they are overturned 80 percent of the time. I think that circuit is -- that circuit is in chaos and that circuit is frankly in turmoil. But we are appealing that, and we are going further.\par \par \uc2 We're issuing a new executive action next week that will comprehensively protect our country. So we'll be going along the one path and hopefully winning that, at the same time we will be issuing a new and very comprehensive order to protect our people. That will be done sometime next week, toward the beginning or middle at the latest part.\par \par \uc2 We have also taken steps to begin construction of the Keystone Pipeline and Dakota Access Pipelines. Thousands and thousands of jobs, and put new buy American measures in place to require American steel for American pipelines. In other words, they build a pipeline in this country, and we use the powers of government to make that pipeline happen, we want them to use American steel. And they are willing to do that, but nobody ever asked before I came along. Even this order was drawn and they didn't say that.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: And I'm reading the order, I'm saying, why aren't we using American steel? And they said, that's a good idea, we put it in. To drain the swamp of corruption in Washington, D.C., I've started by imposing a five-year lobbying ban on White House officials and a lifetime ban on lobbying for a foreign government.\par \par \uc2 We've begun preparing to repeal and replace Obamacare. Obamacare is a disaster, folks. It is's disaster. I know you can say, oh, Obamacare. I mean, they fill up our alleys with people that you wonder how they get there, but they are not the Republican people that our representatives are representing.\par \par \uc2 So we've begun preparing to repeal and replace Obamacare, and are deep in the midst of negotiations on a very historic tax reform to bring our jobs back, to bring our jobs back to this country. Big league. It's already happening. But big league.\par \par \uc2 I've also worked to install a cabinet over the delays and obstruction of Senate Democrats. You've seen what they've done over the last long number of years. That will be one of the great cabinets ever assembled in American history.\par \par \uc2 You look at \uc2 Rex Tillerson\uc2 . He's out there negotiating right now. General Mattis I mentioned before, General Kelly. We have great, great people. Mick is with us now. We have great people.\par \par \uc2 Among their responsibilities will be ending the bleeding of jobs from our country and negotiating fair trade deals for our citizens.\par \par \uc2 Now look, fair trade. Not free, fair. If a country is taking advantage of us, not going to let that happen anymore. Every country takes advantage of us almost. I may be able to find a couple that don't. But for the most part, that would be a very tough job for me to do.\par \par \uc2 Jobs have already started to surge. Since my election, \uc2 Ford\uc2  announced it will abandon its plans to build a new factory in Mexico, and will instead invest $700 million in Michigan, creating many, many jobs.\par \par \uc2 Fiat Chrysler\uc2  announced it will invest $1 billion in Ohio and Michigan, creating 2,000 new American jobs. They were with me a week ago. You know you were here.\par \par \uc2 General Motors\uc2  likewise committed to invest billions of dollars in its American manufacturing operation, keeping many jobs here that were going to leave. And if I didn't get elected, believe me, they would have left. And these jobs and these things that I'm announcing would never have come here.\par \par \uc2 Intel\uc2  just announced that it will move ahead with a new plant in Arizona that probably was never going to move ahead with. And that will result in at least 10,000 American jobs.\par \par \uc2 Walmart\uc2  announced it will create 10,000 jobs in the United States just this year because of our various plans and initiatives. There will be many, many more, many more, these are a few that we're naming.\par \par \uc2 Other countries have been taking advantage of us for decades -- decades, and decades, and decades, folks. And we're not going to let that happen anymore. Not going to let it happen.\par \par \uc2 And one more thing, I have kept my promise to the American people by nominating a justice of the United States Supreme Court, Judge Neil Gorsuch, who is from my list of 20, and who will be a true defender of our laws and our Constitution, highly respected, should get the votes from the Democrats. You may not see that. But he'll get there one way or the other. But he should get there the old-fashioned way, and he should get those votes.\par \par \uc2 This last month has represented an unprecedented degree of action on behalf of the great citizens of our country. Again, I say it. There has never been a presidency that's done so much in such a short period of time. And we have not even started the big work yet. That starts early next week.\par \par \uc2 Some very big things are going to be announced next week. So we are just getting started. We will be giving a speech, as I said, in Melbourne, Florida, at 5:00 p.m. I hope to see you there.\par \par \uc2 And with that, I just say, God bless America, and let's take some questions.\par \par \uc2 Mara (ph), Mara (ph), go ahead. You were cut off pretty violently at our last news conference.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Mike Flynn is a fine person, and I asked for his resignation. He respectfully gave it. He is a man who, there was a certain amount of information given to Vice President Pence, who is with us today. And I was not happy with the way that information was given.\par \par \uc2 He didn't have to do that, because what he did wasn't wrong -- what he did in terms of the information he saw. What was wrong was the way that other people, including yourselves in this room, were given that information, because that was classified information that was given illegally. That's the real problem.\par \par \uc2 And, you know, you can talk all you want about Russia, which was all a, you know, fake news, fabricated deal, to try and make up for the loss of the Democrats and the press plays right into it. In fact, I saw a couple of the people that were supposedly involved with all of this -- that they know nothing about it; they weren't in Russia; they never made a phone call to Russia; they never received a phone call.\par \par \uc2 It's all fake news. It's all fake news. The nice thing is, I see it starting to turn, where people are now looking at the illegal -- I think it's very important -- the illegal, giving out classified information. It was -- and let me just tell you, it was given out like so much.\par \par \uc2 I'll give you an example. I called, as you know, Mexico. It was a very, very confidential, classified call. But I called Mexico. And in calling Mexico, I figured, oh, well that's -- I spoke to the president of Mexico; I had a good call. All of a sudden, it's out there for the world to see. It's supposed to be secret. It's supposed to be either confidential or classified, in that case.\par \par \uc2 Same thing with Australia. All of a sudden, people are finding out exactly what took place. The same thing happened with respect to General Flynn. Everybody saw this. And I'm saying -- the first thing I thought of when I heard about it is: How does the press get this information that's classified? How do they do it?\par \par \uc2 You know why? Because it's an illegal process and the press should be ashamed of themselves. But more importantly, the people that gave out the information to the press should be ashamed of themselves, really ashamed.\par \par \uc2 Yes, go ahead.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Because when I looked at the information, I said, "I don't think he did anything wrong; if anything, he did something right." He was coming into office. He looked at the information. He said, "Huh, that's fine." That's what they're supposed to do. They're supposed to -- he didn't just call Russia. He called and spoke to both ways, I think there were 30-some-odd countries. He's doing the job.\par \par \uc2 You know, he was doing his job. The thing is, he didn't tell our vice president properly, and then he said he didn't remember. So either way, it wasn't very satisfactory to me. And I have somebody that I think will be outstanding for the position. And that also helps, I think, in the making of my decision.\par \par \uc2 But he didn't tell the vice president of the United States the facts. And then he didn't remember. And that just wasn't acceptable to me.\par \par \uc2 Yes?\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: (inaudible) clarification here. During your campaign, did anyone from your team (inaudible) Russian government or Russian intelligence? And if so, what was the nature of those conversations (inaudible)?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: The failing \uc2 New York Times\uc2  wrote a big, long front-page story yesterday. And it was very much discredited, as you know. It was -- it's a joke. And the people mentioned in the story, I notice they were on television today saying they never even spoke to Russia. They weren't even a part, really -- I mean, they were such a minor part. They -- I hadn't spoken to them.\par \par \uc2 I think the one person -- I don't think I've ever spoken to him. I don't think I've ever met him. And he actually said he was a very low-level member of I think a committee for a short period of time. I don't think I ever met him. Now, it's possible that I walked into a room and he was sitting there, but I don't think I ever met him. I didn't talk to him ever. And he thought it was a joke.\par \par \uc2 The other person said he never spoke to Russia; never received a call. Look at his phone records, et cetera, et cetera. And the other person, people knew that he represented various countries, but I don't think he represented Russia, but knew that he represented various countries. That's what he does. I mean, people know that.\par \par \uc2 That's Mr. Manafort, who's -- by the way, who's by the way a respected man. He's a respected man. But I think he represented the Ukraine or Ukraine government or somebody, but everybody -- people knew that. Everybody knew that.\par \par \uc2 So, these people -- and he said that he has absolutely nothing to do and never has with Russia. And he said that very forcefully. I saw his statement. He said it very forcefully. Most of the papers don't print it because that's not good for their stories.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: So the three people that they talked about all totally deny it. And I can tell you, speaking for myself, I own nothing in Russia. I have no loans in Russia. I don't have any deals in Russia. President Putin called me up very nicely to congratulate me on the win of the election.\par \par \uc2 He then, called me up extremely nicely to congratulate me on the inauguration, which was terrific. But so did many other leaders, almost all other leaders from almost all of the country. So that's the extent.\par \par \uc2 Russia is fake news. Russia -- this is fake news put out by the media. The real news is the fact that people, probably from the Obama administration because they're there, because we have our new people going in place, right now.\par \par \uc2 As you know, Mike Pompeo has -- has now taken control of the CIA, James Comey at \uc2 FBI\uc2 , Dan Coats is waiting to be approved, I mean he is a senator and a highly respected one and he's still waiting to be approved. But our new people are going in.\par \par \uc2 And just while you're at it, because you mentioned this, Wall Street Journal did a story today that was almost as disgraceful as the failing New York Time's story, yesterday. And it talked about -- these are (ph) front page.\par \par \uc2 So director of national intelligence just put out, acting a statement, any suggestion that the United States intelligence community, this was just given to us, is withholding information and not providing the best possible intelligence to the president and his national security team is not true.\par \par \uc2 So they took this front page story out of The Wall Street Journal top and they just wrote the story that its not true. And I'll tell you something, I'll be honest, because I sort of enjoy this back and forth that I guess I have all my life but I've never seen more dishonest media than frankly, the political media. I thought the financial media was much better, much more honest.\par \par \uc2 But I will say that, I never get phone calls from the media. How did they write a story like that in The Wall Street Journal without asking me or how did they write a story in The \uc2 New York Times\uc2 , put it on front page?\par \par \uc2 That was like the story they wrote about the women and me, front page, big massive story. And it was nasty and then they called, they said we never said that, we like Mr. Trump. They called up my office, we like Mr. Trump, we never said that.\par \par \uc2 And it was totally -- they totally misrepresented those very wonderful women, I have to tell you, totally misrepresented. I said give us the retraction. They never gave us a retraction and frankly, I then went on to other things.\par \par \uc2 OK, go ahead.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE) said today that you have big intellectual margins (inaudible) 300 or more (ph), or 350 (ph) electoral (ph) votes. President Obama about 365 (OFF-MIKE).\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Yeah.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Obama (OFF-MIKE) 426 on (OFF-MIKE). So why should Americans...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: ...I'm skipping that information, I don't know, I was just given (ph) we had a very, very big margin.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE) why should Americans trust you (OFF-MIKE) the information (OFF-MIKE)?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Well, I don't know, I was given that information. I was given -- I actually, I've seen that information around. But it was a very substantial victory, do you agree with that? OK thank you, that's...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Go ahead Sir, yes?\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Can you tell us in determining that Lieutenant General Flynn did -- whether there was no wrongdoing in your mind, what evidence was weighed? Did you ask for transcripts of these telephone intercepts with Russian officials, particularly the Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, who he was communicating with?\par \par \uc2 What-- what evidence did you weigh to determine that there was no wrongdoing? Further to that, Sir, you said on a couple of locations this morning, you are going to aggressively pursue the source of these leaks.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: We are.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Can we ask what you're going to do and also, we've heard about a -- a review of the intelligence community headed up by Steven Feinberg, what can you tell us about that?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Well, first of all about that, we now have Dan Coats, hopefully soon, Mike Pompeo and James Comey and they're in position so I hope that we'll be able to straighten that out without using anybody else.\par \par \uc2 The gentleman you mentioned is a very talented man, very successful man and he's offered his services and you know, it's something we may take advantage of. But I don't think we're need that at all because of the fact that you know, I think that we are gonna be able to straighten it out very easily on its own.\par \par \uc2 As far as the general's concerned, when I first heard about it, I said huh, that doesn't sound wrong. My counsel came, Don McGahn, White House Counsel, and he told me and I asked him, he can speak very well for himself. He said he doesn't think anything is wrong, you know, really didn't think.\par \par \uc2 It was really, what happened after that but he didn't think anything was done wrong. I didn't either because I waited a period of time and I started to think about it, I said "well I don't see" -- to me, he was doing the job.\par \par \uc2 The information was provided by -- who I don't know, Sally Yates. And I was a little surprised because I said "doesn't sound like he did anything wrong there." But he did something wrong with respect to the vice president and I thought that was not acceptable. As far as -- as far as the actual making the call, fact I've watched various programs and I've read various articles where he was just doing his job.\par \par \uc2 That was very normal. You know, first everybody got excited because they thought he did something wrong. After they thought about it, it turned out he was just doing his job. So -- and I do. And by the way, with all of that being said, I do think he's a fine man.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Sir, if I could, on the leaks -- on the leaks, sir...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: ...Go ahead. Finish off then I'll get you.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: I'm sorry. What will you do on the leaks? You've said twice today...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: ...Yes, we're looking at them very -- very, very serious. I've gone to all of the folks in charge of the various agencies and we're -- I've actually called the Justice Department to look into the leaks. Those are criminal leaks. They're put out by people either in agencies -- I think you'll see it stopping because now we have our people in. You know, again, we don't have our people in because we can't get them approved by the Senate.\par \par \uc2 We just had Jeff Sessions approved. Injustice, as an example (ph). So, we are looking into that very seriously. It's a criminal act. You know what I say, when I -- when I was called out on Mexico, I was shocked because all this equipment, all this incredible phone equipment -- when I was called out on Mexico, I was -- honestly, I was really, really surprised.\par \par \uc2 But I said "you know, it doesn't make sense. That won't happen" but that wasn't that important a call, it was fine, I could show it to the world and he could show it to the world, the president who's a very fine man, by the way. Same thing with Australia. I said "that's terrible that it was leaked" but it wasn't that important. But then I said to myself "what happens when I'm dealing with the problem of North Korea?"\par \par \uc2 What happens when I'm dealing with the problems in the Middle East? Are you folks going to be reporting all of that very, very confidential information, very important, very -- you know, I mean at the highest level? Are you going to be reporting about that too? So, I don't want classified information getting out to the public and in a way that was almost a test.\par \par \uc2 So I'm dealing with Mexico, I'm dealing with Argentina, we were dealing on this case with Mike Flynn. All this information gets put into the "\uc2 Washington Post\uc2 " and gets put into the "\uc2 New York Times\uc2 " and I'm saying "what's going to happen when I'm dealing on the Middle East? What's going to happen when I'm dealing with really, really important subjects like North Korea?\par \par \uc2 We got to stop it. That's why it's a criminal penalty.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: I just want to get you to clarify this very important point. Can you say definitively that nobody on your campaign had any contacts with the Russians during the campaign? And on the leaks, is it fake news or are these real leaks?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Well the leaks are real. You're the one that wrote about them and reported them, I mean the leaks are real. You know what they said, you saw it and the leaks are absolutely real. The news is fake because so much of the news is fake. So one thing that I felt it was very important to do -- and I hope we can correct it. Because there's nobody I have more respect for -- well, maybe a little bit but the reporters, good reporters.\par \par \uc2 It's very important to me and especially in this position. It's very important. I don't mind bad stories. I can handle a bad story better than anybody as long as it's true and, you know, over a course of time, I'll make mistakes and you'll write badly and I'm OK with that. But I'm not OK when it is fake. I mean, I watch \uc2 CNN\uc2 , it's so much anger and hatred and just the hatred.\par \par \uc2 I don't watch it any more because it's very good -- he's saying no. It's OK, Jim (ph). It's OK, Jim (ph), you'll have your chance. But I watch others too. You're not the only one so don't feel badly. But I think it should be straight. I think it should be -- I think it would be frankly more interesting. I know how good everybody's ratings are right now but I think that actually -- I think that'd actually be better.\par \par \uc2 People -- I mean, you have a lower approval rate than Congress. I think that's right. I don't know, Peter (ph), is that one right? Because you know I think they have lower -- I heard lower than Congress. But honestly, the public would appreciate it, I'd appreciate it -- again, I don't mind bad stories when it's true but we have an administration where the Democrats are making it very difficult.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I think we're setting a record or close to a record in the time of approval of a cabinet. I mean, the numbers are crazy. When I'm looking, some of them had them approved immediately.\par \par \uc2 I'm going forever and I still have a lot of people that we're waiting for. And that's all they're doing, is delaying. And you look at Schumer and the mess that he's got over there and they have nothing going. The only thing they can do is delay. And, you know, I think that they'd be better served by, you know, approving and making sure that they're happy and everybody's good.\par \par \uc2 And sometimes -- I mean, I know President Obama lost three or four, and you lose them on the way, and that's OK. That's fine. But I think it would -- I think they would be much better served, John, if they just went through the process quickly. This is pure delay tactics.\par \par \uc2 And they say it, and everybody understands it. Yeah, go ahead, Jimmy.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Well, I had nothing to do with it. I have nothing to do with Russia. I told you, I have no deals there, I have no anything. Now, when \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2 , which I had nothing to do with, comes out and happens to give, they're not giving classified information. They're giving stuff -- what was said at an office about Hillary cheating on the debates.\par \par \uc2 Which, by the way, nobody mentions. Nobody mentions that Hillary received the questions to the debates. Can you imagine -- seriously -- can you imagine if I received the questions? It would be the electric chair. OK, he should be put in the electric -- you would even call for the reinstitution of the death penalty, OK. Maybe not you John. Yes? We'll do you next Jim, I do you next(ph).\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE) clarify --\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Yes, yes, sure\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Did you direct Mike Flynn to discuss sanctions with the Russian ambassador --\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: No, I didn't.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: -- prior to your --\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: No, I didn't.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: -- inauguration.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: No, I didn't.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: And then fired him --\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Excuse me.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: No, I fired him because of what he said to \uc2 Mike Pence\uc2 . Very simple. Mike was doing his job. He was calling countries and his counterparts. So, it certainly would have been OK with me if he did it. I would have directed him to do it if I thought he wasn't doing it.\par \par \uc2 I didn't direct him, but I would have directed him because that's his job. And it came out that way -- and in all fairness, I watched Dr. Charles Krauthammer the other night say he was doing his job and I agreed with him. And since then, I've watched many other people say that.\par \par \uc2 No, I didn't direct him, but I would have directed him if he didn't do it. OK? Jim?\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Thank you very much, and just for the record, we don't hate you. I don't hate you.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: OK.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: So, pass that along --\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Ask -- ask \uc2 Jeff Zucker\uc2  how he got his job. OK?\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: If I may follow up on some of the questions that have taken place so far here, sir --\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Well, that's -- well, you know, we do have other people. You do have other people and your ratings aren't as good as some of the other people that are waiting.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: It's pretty good right now, actually.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: OK, go ahead, John.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: If I may ask, sir, you said earlier that \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  was revealing information about the \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  campaign during the election cycle. You welcomed that. At one time --\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I was OK with it.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: -- you said -- you said that you loved \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2 . At another campaign press conference you called on the Russians to find the missing 30,000 e-mails. I'm wondering, sir, if you --\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Well, she was actually missing 33 and then that got extended with a pile after that.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Then(ph), your(ph) numbers(ph) were off too.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: No -- no, but I did say 30. But it was actually higher than that.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: If -- if I may ask you, sir, it -- it sounds as though you do not have much credibility here when it comes to leaking if that is something that you encouraged during(ph) the campaign --\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: OK, fair question. Ready?\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Well, if I may ask you that --\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: No -- no, but let me do one at a time.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: If I may as a follow up?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Do you mind?\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Yes, sir.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: All right. So, in one case, you're talking about highly classified information. In the other case, you're talking about \uc2 John Podesta\uc2  saying bad things about the boss. I will say this, if \uc2 John Podesta\uc2  said that about me and he was working for me, I would have fired him so fast your head would have spun.\par \par \uc2 He said terrible things about her. But it wasn't classified information. But in one case, you're talking about classified -- regardless, if you look at the RNC, we had a very strong -- at my suggestion -- and I give Reince great credit for this -- at my suggestion, because I know something about this world, I said I want a very strong defensive mechanism.\par \par \uc2 I don't want to be hacked. And we did that. And you have seen that they tried to hack us and they failed. The DNC did not do that. And if they did it, they could not have been hacked. But they were hacked and terrible things came in. And, you know, the only thing that I do think is unfair is some of the things were so -- they were -- when I heard some of those things I picked up the papers the next morning and said, oh, this is going to be front page, it wasn't even in the papers.\par \par \uc2 Again, if I had that happen to me, it would be the biggest story in the history of publishing or the head of newspapers. I would have been headline in every newspaper. I mean, think of it. They gave her the questions to a debate and she -- and she should have reported herself.\par \par \uc2 Why did \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  announce that, "I'm sorry, but I have been given the questions to a debate or a town hall, and I feel that it's inappropriate, and I want to turn in \uc2 CNN\uc2  for not doing a good job."\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: And if I may follow up on that, just something that Jonathan Karl (ph) was asking you about. You said that the leaks are real, but the news is fake. I guess I don't understand. It seems that there's a disconnect there. If the information coming from those leaks is real, then how can the stories be fake?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: The reporting is fake. Look, look...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: You know what it is? Here's the thing. The public isn't -- you know, they read newspapers, they see television, they watch. They don't know if it's true or false because they're not involved. I'm involved. I've been involved with this stuff all my life. But I'm involved. So I know when you're telling the truth or when you're not. I just see many, many untruthful things.\par \par \uc2 And I'll tell you what else I see. I see tone. You know the word "tone." The tone is such hatred. I'm really not a bad person, by the way. No, but the tone is such -- I do get good ratings, you have to admit that -- the tone is such hatred.\par \par \uc2 I watched this morning a couple of the networks. And I have to say, Fox & Friends in the morning, they're very honorable people. They're very -- not because they're good, because they hit me also when I do something wrong. But they have the most honest morning show. That's all I can say. It's the most honest.\par \par \uc2 But the tone, Jim. If you look -- the hatred. The, I mean, sometimes -- sometimes somebody gets...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Well, you look at your show that goes on at 10 o'clock in the evening. You just take a look at that show. That is a constant hit. The panel is almost always exclusive anti-Trump. The good news is he doesn't have good ratings. But the panel is almost exclusive anti-Trump. And the hatred and venom coming from his mouth; the hatred coming from other people on your network.\par \par \uc2 Now, I will say this. I watch it. I see it. I'm amazed by it. And I just think you'd be a lot better off, I honestly do. The public gets it, you know. Look, when I go to rallies, they turn around, they start screaming at \uc2 CNN\uc2 . They want to throw their placards at \uc2 CNN\uc2 . You know.\par \par \uc2 I -- I think you would do much better by being different. But you just take a look. Take a look at some of your shows in the morning and the evening. If a guest comes out and says something positive about me, it's -- it's brutal.\par \par \uc2 Now, they'll take this news conference -- I'm actually having a very good time, OK? But they'll take this news conference -- don't forget, that's the way I won. Remember, I used to give you a news conference every time I made a speech, which was like every day. OK?\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: No, that's how I won. I won with news conferences and probably speeches. I certainly didn't win by people listening to you people. That's for sure. But I'm having a good time.\par \par \uc2 Tomorrow, they will say, "\uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  rants and raves at the press." I'm not ranting and raving. I'm just telling you. You know, you're dishonest people. But -- but I'm not ranting and raving. I love this. I'm having a good time doing it.\par \par \uc2 But tomorrow, the headlines are going to be, "\uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  rants and raves." I'm not ranting and raving.\par \par \uc2 Go ahead.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: If I may, just one more followup...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Should I let him have a little bit more? What do you think, Peter? Peter, should I have -- let him have a little bit more?\par \par \uc2 Sit down. Sit down. We'll...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Just because of the attack of fake news and attacking our network, I just want to ask you, sir...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I'm changing it from fake news, though.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Doesn't that under...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Very fake news.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: ... I know, but aren't you...\par \par \uc2 (LAUGHTER)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Go ahead.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Real news, Mr. President, real news.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: And you're not related to our new...\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: I am not related, sir. No. I do like the sound of Secretary Acosta, I must say.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I looked -- you know, I looked at that name. I said, wait a minute, is there any relation there? Alex Acosta.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: I'm sure you checked that out, sir.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: OK. Now I checked it -- I said -- they said, "No, sir." I said, "Do me a favor, go back and check the family tree."\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: But aren't you -- aren't you concerned, sir, that you are undermining the people's faith in the First Amendment, freedom of the press, the press in this country, when you call stories you don't like "fake news"? Why not just say it's a story I don't like.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I do that.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: When you call it "fake news," you're undermining confidence in our news media (inaudible) important.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: No, no. I do that. Here's the thing. OK. I understand what you're -- and you're right about that, except this. See, I know when I should get good and when I should get bad. And sometimes I'll say, "Wow, that's going to be a great story." And I'll get killed.\par \par \uc2 I know what's good and bad. I'd be a pretty good reporter, not as good as you. But I know what's good. I know what's bad. And when they change it and make it really bad, something that should be positive -- sometimes something that should be very positive, they'll make OK. They'll even make it negative.\par \par \uc2 So I understand it. So, because I'm there. I know what was said. I know who's saying it. I'm there. So it's very important to me.\par \par \uc2 Look, I want to see an honest press. When I started off today by saying that it's so important to the public to get an honest press. The press -- the public doesn't believe you people anymore. Now, maybe I had something to do with that. I don't know. But they don't believe you. If you were straight and really told it like it is, as Howard Cosell used to say, right?\par \par \uc2 Of course, he had some questions also. But if you were straight, I would be your biggest booster. I would be your biggest fan in the world, including bad stories about me. But if you go - as an example, you're \uc2 CNN\uc2 , I mean it's story after story after story is bad. I won. I won. And the other thing, chaos because zero chaos. We are running - this is a fine-tuned machine and Reince happens to be doing a good job but half of his job is putting out lies by the press (ph).\par \par \uc2 You know, I said to him yesterday this whole Russia scam that you guys are building so that you don't talk about the real subject which is illegal leaks, but I watched him yesterday working so hard to try and get that story proper. And I'm saying "here's my chief of staff," a really good guy, did a phenomenal job at RNC. I mean, he won the election, right?\par \par \uc2 We won the presidency. We got some senators, we got some - all over the country, you take a look, he's done a great job. And I said to myself, you know - and I said to somebody that was in the room, I said "you take a look at Reince, he's working so hard just putting out fires that are fake fires." I mean, they're fake. They're not true. And isn't that a shame because he'd rather be working on healthcare, he'd rather be working on tax reform, Jim (ph).\par \par \uc2 I mean that. I would be your biggest fan in the world if you treated me right. I sort of understand there's a certain bias maybe by Jeff (ph) or somebody, you know - you know, whatever reason. But - and I understand that. But you've got to be at least a little bit fair and that's why the public sees it. They see it. They see it's not fair. You take a look at some of your shows and you see the bias and the hatred.\par \par \uc2 And the public is smart, they understand it. Go ahead.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: (inaudible) ...for those who believe that there is something to it, is there anything that you have learned over the last few weeks that you might be able to reveal that might ease their concerns that this isn't fake news? And second...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: ...I think they don't believe it. I don't think the public - that's why the Rasmussen poll just has me through the roof. I don't think they believe it. Well, I guess one of the reasons I'm here today is to tell you the whole Russian thing, that's a ruse. That's a ruse. And by the way, it would be great if we could get along with Russia, just so you understand that.\par \par \uc2 Now tomorrow, you'll say "\uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  wants to get along with Russia, this is terrible." It's not terrible. It's good. We had \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  try and do a reset. We had \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  give Russia 20 percent of the uranium in our country. You know what uranium is, right? This thing called nuclear weapons like lots of things are done with uranium including some bad things.\par \par \uc2 Nobody talks about that. I didn't do anything for Russia. I've done nothing for Russia. \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  gave them 20 percent of our uranium. \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  did a reset, remember? With the stupid plastic button that made us all look like a bunch of jerks. Here, take a look. He looked at her like, what the hell is she doing with that cheap plastic button?\par \par \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  - that was the reset, remember it said reset? Now if I do that, oh, I'm a bad guy. If we could get along with Russia, that's a positive thing. We have a very talented man, \uc2 Rex Tillerson\uc2 , who's going to be meeting with them shortly and I told him. I said "I know politically it's probably not good for me." The greatest thing I could do is shoot that ship that's 30 miles off shore right out of the water.\par \par \uc2 Everyone in this country's going to say "oh, it's so great." That's not great. That's not great. I would love to be able to get along with Russia. Now, you've had a lot of presidents that haven't taken that tack. Look where we are now. Look where we are now. So, if I can - now, I love to negotiate things, I do it really well, and all that stuff. But - but it's possible I won't be able to get along with Putin.\par \par \uc2 Maybe it is. But I want to just tell you, the false reporting by the media, by you people, the false, horrible, fake reporting makes it much harder to make a deal with Russia. And probably Putin said "you know." He's sitting behind his desk and he's saying "you know, I see what's going on in the United States, I follow it closely. It's going to be impossible for President Trump to ever get along with Russia because of all the pressure he's got with this fake story." OK?\par \par \uc2 And that's a shame because if we could get along with Russia - and by the way, China and Japan and everyone. If we could get along, it would be a positive thing, not a negative thing.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Is tax reform on the line (ph)?\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Mr. President? Mr. President? Mr. President, since you...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Tax reform is going to happen fairly quickly. We're doing Obamacare. We're in final stages. We should be submitting the initial plan in March, early March, I would say. And we have to, as you know, statutorily and for reasons of budget, we have to go first. It's not like, frankly, the tax would be easier, in my opinion, but for statutory reasons and for budgetary reasons, we have to submit the healthcare sooner.\par \par \uc2 So we'll be submitting healthcare sometime in early March, mid- March. And after that, we're going to come up, and we're doing very well on tax reform.\par \par \uc2 Yes?\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Mr. President, you mentioned Russia. Let's talk about some serious issues that have come up in the last week that you have had to deal with as president of the United States.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: OK.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: You mentioned the vessel -- the spy vessel off the coast of the United States.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Not good.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: There was a ballistic missile test that many interpret as a violation of an agreement between the two countries; and a Russian plane buzzed a U.S. destroyer.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Not good.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: I listened to you during the campaign ...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Excuse me, excuse me. When did it happen? It happened when, if you were Putin right now, you would say, "Hey, we're back to the old games with the United States; there's no way Trump can ever do a deal with us." Because the -- you have to understand. If I was just brutal on Russia right now, just brutal, people would say, you would say, "Oh, isn't that wonderful." But I know you well enough.\par \par \uc2 Then you would say, "Oh, he was too tough; he shouldn't have done that." Look, all of the...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: I'm just trying to find out your orientation to those...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Wait a minute. Wait, wait. Excuse me just one second.\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: All of those things that you mentioned are very recent, because probably Putin assumes that he's not going to be able to make a deal with me because it's politically not popular for me to make a deal. So \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  tries a re-set. It failed. They all tried. But I'm different than those people.\par \par \uc2 Go ahead.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: How are you interpreting those moves? And what do you intend to do about them? Have you given \uc2 Rex Tillerson\uc2  any advice or counsel on how to deal?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I have. I have. And I'm so beautifully represented. I'm so honored that the Senate approved him. He's going to be fantastic.\par \par \uc2 Yes, I think that I've already...\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Is Putin testing you, do you believe, sir?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: No, I don't think so. I think Putin probably assumes that he can't make a deal with me anymore because politically it would be unpopular for a politician to make a deal. I can't believe I'm saying I'm a politician, but I guess that's what I am now.\par \par \uc2 Because, look, it would be much easier for me to be tough on Russia, but then we're not going to make a deal.\par \par \uc2 Now, I don't know that we're going to make a deal. I don't know. We might. We might not. But it would be much easier for me to be so tough -- the tougher I am on Russia, the better. But you know what? I want to do the right thing for the American people. And to be honest, secondarily, I want to do the right thing for the world.\par \par \uc2 If Russia and the United States actually got together and got along -- and don't forget, we're a very powerful nuclear country and so are they. There's no up-side. We're a very powerful nuclear country and so are they. I have been briefed. And I can tell you one thing about a briefing that we're allowed to say because anybody that ever read the most basic book can say it, nuclear holocaust would be like no other.\par \par \uc2 They're a very powerful nuclear country and so are we. If we have a good relationship with Russia, believe me, that's a good thing, not a bad thing.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: So when you say they're not good, do you mean that they are...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Who did I say is not good?\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: No, I read off the three things that have recently happened. Each one of them you said they're not good.\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: No, it's not good, but they happened.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: But do they damage the relationship? Do they undermine...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: They all happened recently.\par \par \uc2 No...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: ... this country's ability to work with Russia?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: They all happened recently. And I understand what they're doing because they're doing the same thing.\par \par \uc2 Now, again, maybe I'm not going to be able to do a deal with Russia, but at least I will have tried. And if I don't, does anybody really think that \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  would be tougher on Russia than \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 ? Does anybody in this room really believe that? OK?\par \par \uc2 But I tell you one thing, she tried to make a deal. She had the re-set. She gave all that valuable uranium away. She did other things. You know, they say I'm close to Russia. \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  gave away 20 percent of the uranium in the United States. She's close to Russia.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Can we...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I gave -- you know what I gave to Russia? You know what I gave? Nothing.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Can we conclude there will be no response to these particular provocations?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I'm not going to tell you anything about what response I do. I don't talk about military response. I don't say I'm going into Mosul in four months. "We are going to attack Mosul in four months." Then three months later, "We are going to attack Mosul in one month." ''Next week, we are going to attack Mosul."\par \par \uc2 In the meantime, Mosul is very, very difficult. Do you know why? Because I don't talk about military, and I don't talk about certain other things, you're going to be surprised to hear that. And by the way, my whole campaign, I'd say that. So I don't have to tell you. I don't want to be one of these guys that say, "Yes, here's what we're going to do." I don't have to do that. I don't have to tell you what I'm going to do in North Korea.\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Wait a minute. I don't have to tell you what I'm going to do in North Korea. And I don't have to tell you what I'm going to do with Iran. You know why? Because they shouldn't know. And eventually, you guys are going to get tired of asking that question.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: So when you ask me what am I going to do with a ship, the Russian ship as an example, I'm not going to tell you. But hopefully, I won't have to do anything, but I'm not going to tell you.\par \par \uc2 OK.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Could I just ask you -- thank you very much, Mr. President. The trouble...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Where are you from?\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: \uc2 BBC\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Here's another beauty.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: That's a good line. Impartial, free and fair.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Yeah. Sure.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Mr. President...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Just like \uc2 CNN\uc2  right?\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: On the travel ban -- we could banter back and forth. On the travel ban would you accept that that was a good example of the smooth running of government...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Yeah, I do. I do. Let me tell you about this government...\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Were there any mistakes...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Wait. Wait. I know who you are. Just wait.\par \par \uc2 Let me tell you about the travel ban. We had a very smooth rollout of the travel ban. But we had a bad court. Got a bad decision. We had a court that's been overturned. Again, may be wrong. But I think it's 80 percent of the time, a lot.\par \par \uc2 We had a bad decision. We're going to keep going with that decision. We're going to put in a new executive order next week some time. But we had a bad decision.\par \par \uc2 That's the other thing that was wrong with the travel ban. You had Delta with a massive problem with their computer system at the airports. You had some people that were put out there, brought by very nice busses, and they were put out at various locations.\par \par \uc2 Despite that the only problem that we had is we had a bad court. We had a court that gave us what I consider to be, with great respect, a very bad decision. Very bad for the safety and security of our country. The rollout was perfect.\par \par \uc2 Now, what I wanted to do was do the exact same executive order, but said one thing. I said this to my people. Give them a one-month period of time. But Gen. Kelly, now Sec. Kelly, said if you do that, all these people will come in and (inaudible) the bad ones.\par \par \uc2 You do agree there are bad people out there, right? That not everybody that's like you. You have some bad people out there.\par \par \uc2 Kelly said you can't do that. And he was right. As soon as he said it I said wow, never thought of it. I said how about one week? He said no good. You got to do it immediately because if you do it immediately they don't have time to come in.\par \par \uc2 Now nobody ever reports that. But that's why we did it quickly.\par \par \uc2 Now, if I would've done it a month, everything would've been perfect. The problem is we would've wasted a lot of time, and maybe a lot of lives because a lot of bad people would've come into our country.\par \par \uc2 Now in the meantime, we're vetting very, very strongly. Very, very strongly. But we need help. And we need help by getting that executive order passed.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Just a brief follow-up. But if it's so urgent, why not introduce...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Yes? Go ahead.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Thank you. I was just hoping that we could get a yes or no answer on one of these questions involving Russia. Can you say whether you are aware that anyone who advised your campaign had contacts with Russia during the course of the election?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Well I told you, Gen. Flynn obviously was dealing. So that's one person. But he was dealing, as he should have been.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: During the election?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: No. Nobody that I know of. Nobody...\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: So you're not aware of any contact during the course..\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Look, look, look...\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: ... of the election?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: How many times do I have to answer this question?\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Can you just say yes or no?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Russia is a ruse.\par \par \uc2 I know you have to get up and ask a question. It's so important.\par \par \uc2 Russia is a ruse. I have nothing to do with Russia. Haven't made a phone call to Russia in years. Don't speak to people from Russia. Not that I wouldn't. I just have nobody to speak to.\par \par \uc2 I spoke to Putin twice. He called me on the election. I told you this. And he called me on the inauguration, a few days ago.\par \par \uc2 We had a very good talk, especially the second one, lasted for a pretty long period of time. I'm sure you probably get it because it was classified. So I'm sure everybody in this room perhaps has it. But we had a very, very good talk.\par \par \uc2 I have nothing to do with Russia. To the best of my knowledge no person that I deal with does.\par \par \uc2 Now, Manafort has totally denied it. He denied it. Now people knew that he was a consultant over in that part of the world for a while, but not for Russia. I think he represented Ukraine or people having to do with Ukraine, or people that -- whoever. But people knew that. Everybody knew that.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: But in his capacity as your campaign manager, was he in touch with Russian officials during the election?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: You know what? He said no. I could only tell you what he -- now he was replaced long before the election. You know that, right?\par \par \uc2 He was replaced long before the election. When all of this stuff started coming out, it came out during the election. But \uc2 Paul Manafort\uc2 , who's a good man also by the way, Paul Manfort was replaced long before the election took place. He was only there for a short period of time.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Mr. President...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: How much longer should we stay here, folks?\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Mr. President...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Five more minutes. Is that OK? Five?\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Mr. President, on national...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Wait. Let's see. Who's -- I want to find a friendly reporter.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Mr....\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Are you a friendly reporter? Watch how friendly he is. Wait. Wait. Watch how friendly he is. Go ahead.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Go ahead.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: So first of all, my name is (Inaudible) from (Inaudible) Magazine. I (inaudible). I haven't seen anybody in my community, including yourself or any of the -- anyone on your staff of being (OFF-MIKE).\par \par \uc2 Because (OFF-MIKE). However, what we've already heard about and what we (OFF-MIKE) is (OFF-MIKE) so you're general forecast (ph) like 48 (OFF-MIKE). There are people who are everything (ph) happens through their packs (ph) is one of the (OFF-MIKE)...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP:...he said he was gonna ask a very simple, easy question. And it's not, its not, not -- not a simple question, not a fair question. OK sit down, I understand the rest of your question.\par \par \uc2 So here's the story, folks. Number one, I am the least anti- Semitic person that you've ever seen in your entire life. Number two, racism, the least racist person. In fact, we did very well relative to other people running as a Republican -- quiet, quiet, quiet.\par \par \uc2 See, he lied about -- he was gonna get up and ask a very straight, simple question, so you know, welcome to the world of the media. But let me just tell you something, that I hate the charge, I find it repulsive.\par \par \uc2 I hate even the question because people that know me and you heard the prime minister, you heard Ben Netanyahu (ph) yesterday, did you hear him, Bibi? He said, I've known \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  for a long time and then he said, forget it.\par \par \uc2 So you should take that instead of having to get up and ask a very insulting question like that.\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Yeah, go ahead. Go ahead.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Thank you, I'm Lisa (ph) from the...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: See, it just shows you about the press, but that's the way the press is.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. President. Lisa Dejardown (ph) from the \uc2 PBS\uc2  News Hour. On national security and immigration, can you give us more details on the executive order you plan for next week? Even its broad outlines?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Yeah.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Will it be focused on specific...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: It's a very fair question.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: ...countries? And in addition, on the DACA program for immigration.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Right.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: What is your plan, do you plan to continue that program or to end it?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: We're gonna show great heart, DACA is a very, very difficult subject for me, I will tell you. To me, it's one of the most difficult subjects I have because you have these incredible kids.\par \par \uc2 In many cases, not in all cases. And some of the cases, having DACA and they're gang members and they're drug dealers, too. But you have some absolutely, incredible kids, I would say mostly. They were brought here in such a way -- it's a very -- it's a very, very tough subject.\par \par \uc2 We're gonna deal with DACA with heart. I have to deal with a lot of politicians, don't forget and I have to convince them that what I'm saying is -- is right. And I appreciate your understanding on that.\par \par \uc2 But the DACA situation is a very, very -- it's a very difficult thing for me because you know, I love these kids, I love kids, I have kids and grandkids. And I find it very, very hard doing what the law says exactly to do and you know, the law is rough.\par \par \uc2 I'm not talking about new laws, I'm talking the existing law, is very rough, it's very, very rough. As far as the new order, the new order is going to be very much tailored to the what I consider to be a very bad decision.\par \par \uc2 But we can tailor the order to that decision and get just about everything, in some ways, more. But we're tailoring it now to the decision, we have some of the best lawyers in the country working on it.\par \par \uc2 And the new executive order, is being tailored to the decision we got down from the court. OK?\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Mr. President...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: ...reopening of the White House Visitors Office?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Yes.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: And she does a lot of great work for the country as well (ph). Can you talk a little bit about what's first for (ph) Melania Trump does for the country and (inaudible) so opening White House Visitors Office, what does that mean...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Now, that's what I call a nice question. That is very -- who are you with?\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Good, I'm gonna start watching, all right? Thank you very much. Melania's terrific, she was here last night, we had dinner with Senator Rubio and his wife who is by the way, lovely.\par \par \uc2 And we had a really good discussion about Cuba because we have very similar views on Cuba. And Cuba was very good to me in the Florida election, as you know the Cuban Americans. And I think that Melania's gonna be outstanding, that's right, she just opened up the visitors center, in other words, touring of the White House.\par \par \uc2 She, like others that she's working with, feel very, very strongly about women's issue, women's difficulties. Very, very strongly, she's a very, very strong advocate. I think she's a great representative for this country.\par \par \uc2 And a funny thing happens, because she gets -- she gets so unfairly -- Melania, the things they say. I've known her for a long time, she was a very successful person, she was a very successful model. She did really well.\par \par \uc2 She would go home at night and didn't even want to go out with people. She was a very private person. She was always the highest quality that you'll ever find. And the things they say -- I've known her for a long time -- the things they say are so unfair. And actually, she's been apologized to, as you know, by various media because they said things that were lies.\par \par \uc2 I'll just tell you this. I think she's going to be a fantastic first lady. She's going to be a tremendous representative of women and of the people. And helping her and working her will be Ivanka, who is a fabulous person and a fabulous, fabulous woman. And they're not doing this for money.\par \par \uc2 They're not doing this for pay, they're doing this because they feel it; both of them. And Melania goes back and forth and after Barron finishes school -- because it's hard to take a child out of school with a few months left -- she and Barron will be moving over to the White House. OK, thank you, that's a very nice question.\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Go ahead.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Mr. Trump?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Yes, oh, this is going to be a bad question, but that's OK.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: It doesn't(ph) have(ph) to be a bad question.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Good, because I enjoy watching you on television. Go ahead.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Well, thank you so much. Mr. President, I need to find out from you, you said something as it relates to inner cities. That was one of your platforms during your campaign. Now you're --\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Fix the inner cities.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: -- president. Fixing the inner cities.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Yep.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: What will be that fix and your urban agenda as well as your HBCU Executive Order that's coming out this afternoon? See, it wasn't bad, was it?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: That was very professional and very good.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: I'm very professional.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: We'll be announcing the order in a little while and I'd rather let the order speak for itself. But it could be something that I think that will be very good for everybody concerned. But we'll talk to you about that after we do the announcement. As far as the inner cities, as you know, I was very strong on the inner cities during the campaign.\par \par \uc2 I think it's probably what got me a much higher percentage of the African American vote than a lot of people thought I was going to get. We did, you know, much higher than people thought I was going to get. And I was honored by that, including the Hispanic vote, which was also much higher.\par \par \uc2 And by the way, if I might add, including the women's vote, which was much higher than people thought I was going to get. So, we are going to be working very hard on the inner cities, having to do with education, having to do with crime. We're going to try and fix as quickly as possible -- you know, it takes a long time.\par \par \uc2 It's taken more a hundred years and more for some of these places to evolve and they evolved, many of them, very badly. But we're going to be working very hard on health and healthcare, very, very hard on education, and also we're going to be working in a stringent way, in a very good way, on crime.\par \par \uc2 You go to some of these inner city places and it's so sad when you look at the crime. You have people -- and I've seen this, and I've sort of witnessed it -- in fact, in two cases I have actually witnessed it. They lock themselves into apartments, petrified to even leave, in the middle of the day.\par \par \uc2 They're living in hell. We can't let that happen. So, we're going to be very, very strong. That's a great question and -- and it's a -- it's a very difficult situation because it's been many, many years. It's been festering for many, many years. But we have places in this country that we have to fix.\par \par \uc2 We have to help African American people that, for the most part, are stuck there. Hispanic American people. We have Hispanic American people that are in the inner cities and their living in hell. I mean, you look at the numbers in Chicago. There are two Chicagos, as you know.\par \par \uc2 There's one Chicago that's incredible, luxurious and all -- and safe. There's another Chicago that's worse than almost any of the places in the Middle East that we talk, and that you talk about, every night on the newscasts. So, we're going to do a lot of work on the inner cities.\par \par \uc2 I have great people lined up to help with the inner cities. OK?\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Well, when you say the inner cities, are you going -- are you going to include the CBC, Mr. President, in your conversations with your -- your urban agenda, your inner city agenda, as well as --\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Am I going to include who?\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Are you going to include the \uc2 Congressional Black Caucus\uc2  and the Congressional --\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Well, I would. I tell you what, do you want to set up the meeting?\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: -- Hispanic Caucus --\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Do you want to set up the meeting?\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: No -- no -- no. I'm not --\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Are they friends of yours?\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: I'm just a reporter.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Well, then(ph) set up the meeting.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: I know some of them, but I'm sure they're watching right now.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Let's go set up a meeting. I would love to meet with the Black Caucus. I think it's great, the \uc2 Congressional Black Caucus\uc2 . I think it's great. I actually thought I had a meeting with Congressman Cummings and he was all excited. And then he said, well, I can't move, it might be bad for me politically. I can't have that meeting.\par \par \uc2 I was all set to have the meeting. You know, we called him and called him. And he was all set. I spoke to him on the phone, very nice guy.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: I hear he wanted that meeting with you as well.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: He wanted it, but we called, called, called and can't make a meeting with him. Every day I walk and say I would like to meet with him because I do want to solve the problem. But he probably was told by Schumer or somebody like that, some other lightweight. He was probably told - he was probably told "don't meet with Trump. It's bad politics."\par \par \uc2 And that's part of the problem in this country. OK, one more.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: (inaudible)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: No, no, one question. Two we can't handle. This room can't handle two. Go ahead, give me the better of your two.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: (inaudible) ...not about your personality or your beliefs, talking about (inaudible), some of it by supporters in your name. What do you...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: ...And some of it - can I be honest with you? And this has to do with racism and horrible things that are put up. Some of it written by our opponents. You do know that. Do you understand that? You don't think anybody would do a thing like that. Some of the signs you'll see are not put up by the people that love or like \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 , they're put up by the other side and you think it's like playing it straight?\par \par \uc2 No. But you have some of those signs and some of that anger is caused by the other side. They'll do signs and they'll do drawings that are inappropriate. It won't be my people. It will be the people on the other side to anger people like you. OK.\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Go ahead, go ahead.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: You're the president now. What are you going to do about it?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Who is that? Where is that?\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: What are you going to do about - what are you going to do about (inaudible).\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Oh, I'm working on it. I'm working on it very - no, no, look. Hey, just so you understand, we had a totally divided country for eight years and long before that. In all fairness to President Obama, long before President Obama we have had a very divided - I didn't come along and divide this country. This country was seriously divided before I got here.\par \par \uc2 We're going to work on it very hard. One of the questions I was asked, I thought it was a very good question was about the inner cities. I mean, that's part of it. But we're going to work on education, we're going to work on - you know, we're going to stop - we're going to try and stop the crime. We have great law enforcement officials, we're going to try and stop crime.\par \par \uc2 We're not going to try and stop, we're going to stop crime. But it's very important to me - but this isn't \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  that divided a nation. We went eight years with President Obama and we went many years before President Obama. We lived in a divided nation. And I am going to try - I will do everything within my power to fix that. I want to thank everybody very much.\par \par \uc2 It's a great honor to be with you. Thank you. Thank you very much, thanks.\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020170217ed2h0079i\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 President \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  defended his presidency, slammed reports that his campaign advisers had inappropriate contact with Russian officials and promised to crack down on the leaking of classified information in a news conference Thursday at the White House. Here is the full transcript:\par \par \uc2 ____\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Thank you very much.\par \par \uc2 I just wanted to begin by mentioning that the nominee for secretary of the Department of Labor will be Mr. Alex Acosta. He has a law degree from Harvard Law School, was a great student; former clerk for Justice Samuel Alito. And he has had a tremendous career. He's a member and has been a member of the \uc2 National Labor Relations Board\uc2 , and has been through Senate confirmation three times, confirmed; did very, very well.\par \par \uc2 And so Alex, I've wished him the best. We just spoke. And he's going to be -- I think he'll be a tremendous secretary of labor.\par \par \uc2 And also as you probably heard just a little while ago, Mick Mulvaney, former congressman, has just been approved weeks late, I have to say that, weeks, weeks late, Office of Management and Budget. And he will be I think a fantastic addition.\par \par \uc2 Paul Singer\uc2  just left. As you know, Paul was very much involved with the anti-Trump or as they say, "never Trump." And Paul just left and he's given us his total support. And it's all about unification. We're unifying the party and hopefully we're going to be able to unify the country. It's very important to me. I've been talking about that for a long time. It's very, very important to me.\par \par \uc2 So I want to thank \uc2 Paul Singer\uc2  for being here and for coming up to the office. He was a very strong opponent, and now he's a very strong ally. And I appreciate that.\par \par \uc2 I think I'll say a few words, and then we'll take some questions. And I had this time. We've been negotiating a lot of different transactions to save money on contracts that were terrible, including airplane contracts that were out of control and late and terrible; just absolutely catastrophic in terms of what was happening. And we've done some really good work. We're very proud of that.\par \par \uc2 And then right after that, you prepare yourselves, we'll do some questions, unless you have enough questions. That's always a possibility.\par \par \uc2 I'm here today to update the American people on the incredible progress that has been made in the last four weeks since my inauguration. We have made incredible progress. I don't think there's ever been a president elected who in this short period of time has done what we've done.\par \par \uc2 A new Rasmussen poll, in fact -- because the people get it -- much of the media doesn't get it. They actually get it, but they don't write it. Let's put it that way. But a new Rasmussen poll just came out just a very short while ago, and it has our approval rating at 55 percent and going up. The stock market has hit record numbers, as you know. And there has been a tremendous surge of optimism in the business world, which is -- to me means something much different than it used to. It used to mean, "Oh, that's good." Now it means, "That's good for jobs." Very different.\par \par \uc2 Plants and factories are already starting to move back into the United States, and big league -- \uc2 Ford\uc2 , \uc2 General Motors\uc2 , so many of them. I'm making this presentation directly to the American people, with the media present, which is an honor to have you.\par \par \uc2 This morning, because many of our nation's reporters and folks will not tell you the truth, and will not treat the wonderful people of our country with the respect that they deserve. And I hope going forward we can be a little bit -- a little bit different, and maybe get along a little bit better, if that's possible. Maybe it's not, and that's OK, too.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Unfortunately, much of the media in Washington, D.C., along with New York, Los Angeles in particular, speaks not for the people, but for the special interests and for those profiting off a very, very obviously broken system. The press has become so dishonest that if we don't talk about, we are doing a tremendous disservice to the American people. Tremendous disservice. We have to talk to find out what's going on, because the press honestly is out of control. The level of dishonesty is out of control.\par \par \uc2 I ran for president to present the citizens of our country. I am here to change the broken system so it serves their families and their communities well. I am talking -- and really talking on this very entrenched power structure, and what we're doing is we're talking about the power structure; we're talking about its entrenchment. As a result, the media is going through what they have to go through too often times distort - not all the time - and some of the media is fantastic, I have to say - they're honest and fantastic.\par \par \uc2 But much of it is not a - the distortion -- and we'll talk about it, you'll be able to ask me questions about it. But we're not going to let it happen, because I'm here again, to take my message straight to the people. As you know, our administration inherited many problems across government and across the economy. To be honest, I inherited a mess. It's a mess. At home and abroad, a mess. Jobs are pouring out of the country; you see what's going on with all of the companies leaving our country, going to Mexico and other places, low pay, low wages, mass instability overseas, no matter where you look. The middle east is a disaster. North Korea - we'll take care of it folks; we're going to take care of it all. I just want to let you know, I inherited a mess.\par \par \uc2 Beginning on day one, our administration went to work to tackle these challenges. On foreign affairs, we've already begun enormously productive talks with many foreign leaders, much of it you've covered, to move forward towards stability, security and peace in the most troubled regions of the world, which there are many. We have had great conversations with the United Kingdom, and meetings. Israel, Mexico, Japan, China and Canada, really, really productive conversations. I would say far more productive than you would understand.\par \par \uc2 We've even developed a new council with Canada to promote women's business leaders and entrepreneurs. It's very important to me, very important to my daughter Ivanka. I have directed our defense community headed by our great general, now Secretary Mattis. He's over there now working very hard to submit a plan for the defeat of ISIS, a group that celebrates the murder and torture of innocent people in large sections of the world. It used to be a small group, now it's in large sections of the world.\par \par \uc2 They've spread like cancer. ISIS has spread like cancer - another mess I inherited. And we have imposed new sanctions on the nation of Iran, whose totally taken advantage of our previous administration, and they're the world's top sponsor of terrorism, and we're not going to stop until that problem is properly solved. And it's not properly solved now, it's one of the worst agreements I've ever seen drawn by anybody. I've ordered plan to begin building for the massive rebuilding of the United States military. Had great support from the Senate, I've had great from Congress, generally.\par \par \uc2 We've pursued this rebuilding in the hopes that we will never have to use this military, and I will tell you that is my - I would be so happy if we never had to use it. But our country will never have had a military like the military we're about to build and rebuild. We have the greatest people on earth in our military, but they don't have the right equipment and their equipment is old. I used it; I talked about it at every stop. Depleted, it's depleted - it won't be depleted for long. And I think one of the reason I'm standing here instead of other people is that frankly, I talked about we have to have a strong military.\par \par \uc2 We have to have a strong law enforcement also. So we do not go abroad in the search of war, we really are searching for peace, but its peace through strength. At home, we have begun the monumental task of returning the government back to the people on a scale not seen in many, many years. In each of these actions, I'm keeping my promises to the American people. These are campaign promises. Some people are so surprised that we're having strong borders.\par \par \uc2 Well, that's what I've been talking about for a year and a half, strong borders. They're so surprised, oh, he having strong borders, well that's what I've been talking about to the press and to everybody else. One promise after another after years of politicians lying to you to get elected. They lied to the American people in order to get elected. Some of the things I'm doing probably aren't popular but they're necessary for security and for other reasons.\par \par \uc2 And then coming to Washington and pursuing their own interests which is more important to many politicians. I'm here following through on what I pledged to do. That's all I'm doing. I put it out before the American people, got 306 electoral college votes. I wasn't supposed to get 222. They said there's no way to get 222, 230's impossible.\par \par \uc2 270 which you need, that was laughable. We got 306 because people came out and voted like they've never seen before so that's the way it goes. I guess it was the biggest electoral college win since Ronald Reagan. In other words, the media's trying to attack our administration because they know we are following through on pledges that we made and they're not happy about it for whatever reason.\par \par \uc2 And - but a lot of people are happy about it. In fact, I'll be in Melbourne, Florida five o'clock on Saturday and I heard - just heard that the crowds are massive that want to be there. I turn on the T.V., open the newspapers and I see stories of chaos. Chaos. Yet it is the exact opposite. This administration is running like a fine- tuned machine, despite the fact that I can't get my cabinet approved.\par \par \uc2 And they're outstanding people like Senator Dan Coats who's there, one of the most respected men of the Senate. He can't get approved. How do you not approve him? He's been a colleague - highly respected. Brilliant guy, great guy, everybody knows it. We're waiting for approval. So we have a wonderful group of people that's working very hard, that's being very much misrepresented about and we can't let that happen.\par \par \uc2 So, if the Democrats who have - all you have to do is look at where they are right now. The only thing they can do is delay because they screwed things up royally, believe me. Let me list to you some of the things that we've done in just a short period of time. I just got here. And I got here with no cabinet. Again, each of these actions is a promise I made to the American people.\par \par \uc2 I'll go over just some of them and we have a lot happening next week and in the weeks - in the weeks coming. We've withdrawn from the job-killing disaster known as Trans Pacific Partnership. We're going to make trade deals but we're going to have one on one deals, bilateral. We're going to have one on one deals.\par \par \uc2 We've directed the elimination of regulations that undermine manufacturing and call for expedited approval of the permits needed for America and American infrastructure and that means plant, equipment, roads, bridges, factories. People take 10, 15, 20 years to get disapproved for a factory. They go in for a permit, it's many, many years. And then at the end of the process -- they spend 10s of millions of dollars on nonsense and at the end of the process, they get rejected.\par \par \uc2 Now, they may be rejected with me but it's going to be a quick rejection. Not going to take years. But mostly it's going to be an acceptance. We want plants built and we want factories built and we want the jobs. We don't want the jobs going to other countries. We've imposed a hiring freeze on non-essential federal workers. We've imposed a temporary moratorium on new federal regulations.\par \par \uc2 We've issued a game-changing new rule that says for each one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated. Makes sense. Nobody's ever seen regulations like we have. You go to other countries and you look at indexes (ph) they have and you say "let me see your regulations" and they're fraction, just a tiny fraction of what we have. And I want regulations because I want safety, I want environmental - all environmental situations to be taken properly care of. It's very important to me. But you don't need four or five or six regulations to take care of the same thing.\par \par \uc2 We've stood up for the men and women of law enforcement, directing federal agencies to ensure they are protected from crimes of violence. We've directed the creation of a task force for reducing violent crime in America, including the horrendous situation -- take a look at Chicago and others, taking place right now in our inner cities. Horrible.\par \par \uc2 We've ordered the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2  and Justice to coordinate on a plan to destroy criminal cartels coming into the United States with drugs. We're becoming a drug infested nation. Drugs are becoming cheaper than candy bars. We are not going to let it happen any longer.\par \par \uc2 We've undertaken the most substantial border security measures in a generation to keep our nation and our tax dollars safe. And are now in the process of beginning to build a promised wall on the southern border, met with general -- now Secretary Kelly yesterday and we're starting that process. And the wall is going to be a great wall and it's going to be a wall negotiated by me. The price is going to come down just like it has on everything else I've negotiated for the government. And we are going to have a wall that works, not gonna have a wall like they have now which is either non-existent or a joke.\par \par \uc2 We've ordered a crackdown on sanctuary cities that refuse to comply with federal law and that harbor criminal aliens, and we have ordered an end to the policy of catch and release on the border. No more release. No matter who you are, release. We have begun a nationwide effort to remove criminal aliens, gang members, drug dealers and others who pose a threat to public safety. We are saving American lives every single day.\par \par \uc2 The court system has not made it easy for us. And are even creating a new office in Homeland Security dedicated to the forgotten American victims of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  violence, which there are many. We have taken decisive action to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of our country. No parts are necessary and constitutional actions were blocked by judges, in my opinion, incorrect, and unsafe ruling. Our administration is working night and day to keep you safe, including reporters safe. And is vigorously defending this lawful order.\par \par \uc2 I will not back down from defending our country. I got elected on defense of our country. I keep my campaign promises, and our citizens will be very happy when they see the result. They already are, I can tell you that. Extreme vetting will be put in place and it already is in place in many places.\par \par \uc2 In fact, we had to go quicker than we thought because of the bad decision we received from a circuit that has been overturned at a record number. I have heard 80 percent, I find that hard to believe, that is just a number I heard, that they are overturned 80 percent of the time. I think that circuit is -- that circuit is in chaos and that circuit is frankly in turmoil. But we are appealing that, and we are going further.\par \par \uc2 We're issuing a new executive action next week that will comprehensively protect our country. So we'll be going along the one path and hopefully winning that, at the same time we will be issuing a new and very comprehensive order to protect our people. That will be done sometime next week, toward the beginning or middle at the latest part.\par \par \uc2 We have also taken steps to begin construction of the Keystone Pipeline and Dakota Access Pipelines. Thousands and thousands of jobs, and put new buy American measures in place to require American steel for American pipelines. In other words, they build a pipeline in this country, and we use the powers of government to make that pipeline happen, we want them to use American steel. And they are willing to do that, but nobody ever asked before I came along. Even this order was drawn and they didn't say that.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: And I'm reading the order, I'm saying, why aren't we using American steel? And they said, that's a good idea, we put it in. To drain the swamp of corruption in Washington, D.C., I've started by imposing a five-year lobbying ban on White House officials and a lifetime ban on lobbying for a foreign government.\par \par \uc2 We've begun preparing to repeal and replace Obamacare. Obamacare is a disaster, folks. It is's disaster. I know you can say, oh, Obamacare. I mean, they fill up our alleys with people that you wonder how they get there, but they are not the Republican people our that representatives are representing.\par \par \uc2 So we've begun preparing to repeal and replace Obamacare, and are deep in the midst of negotiations on a very historic tax reform to bring our jobs back, to bring our jobs back to this country. Big league. It's already happening. But big league.\par \par \uc2 I've also worked to install a cabinet over the delays and obstruction of Senate Democrats. You've seen what they've done over the last long number of years. That will be one of the great cabinets ever assembled in American history.\par \par \uc2 You look at \uc2 Rex Tillerson\uc2 . He's out there negotiating right now. General Mattis I mentioned before, General Kelly. We have great, great people. Mick is with us now. We have great people.\par \par \uc2 Among their responsibilities will be ending the bleeding of jobs from our country and negotiating fair trade deals for our citizens.\par \par \uc2 Now look, fair trade. Not free, fair. If a country is taking advantage of us, not going to let that happen anymore. Every country takes advantage of us almost. I may be able to find a couple that don't. But for the most part, that would be a very tough job for me to do.\par \par \uc2 Jobs have already started to surge. Since my election, \uc2 Ford\uc2  announced it will abandon its plans to build a new factory in Mexico, and will instead invest $700 million in Michigan, creating many, many jobs.\par \par \uc2 Fiat Chrysler\uc2  announced it will invest $1 billion in Ohio and Michigan, creating 2,000 new American jobs. They were with me a week ago. You know you were here.\par \par \uc2 General Motors\uc2  likewise committed to invest billions of dollars in its American manufacturing operation, keeping many jobs here that were going to leave. And if I didn't get elected, believe me, they would have left. And these jobs and these things that I'm announcing would never have come here.\par \par \uc2 Intel\uc2  just announced that it will move ahead with a new plant in Arizona that probably was never going to move ahead with. And that will result in at least 10,000 American jobs.\par \par \uc2 Walmart\uc2  announced it will create 10,000 jobs in the United States just this year because of our various plans and initiatives. There will be many, many more, many more, these are a few that we're naming.\par \par \uc2 Other countries have been taking advantage of us for decades -- decades, and decades, and decades, folks. And we're not going to let that happen anymore. Not going to let it happen.\par \par \uc2 And one more thing, I have kept my promise to the American people by nominating a justice of the United States Supreme Court, Judge Neil Gorsuch, who is from my list of 20, and who will be a true defender of our laws and our Constitution, highly respected, should get the votes from the Democrats. You may not see that. But he'll get there one way or the other. But he should get there the old-fashioned way, and he should get those votes.\par \par \uc2 This last month has represented an unprecedented degree of action on behalf of the great citizens of our country. Again, I say it. There has never been a presidency that's done so much in such a short period of time. And we have not even started the big work yet. That starts early next week.\par \par \uc2 Some very big things are going to be announced next week. So we are just getting started. We will be giving a speech, as I said, in Melbourne, Florida, at 5:00 p.m. I hope to see you there.\par \par \uc2 And with that, I just say, God bless America, and let's take some questions.\par \par \uc2 Mara (ph), Mara (ph), go ahead. You were cut off pretty violently at our last news conference.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Mike Flynn is a fine person, and I asked for his resignation. He respectfully gave it. He is a man who there was a certain amount of information given to Vice President Pence, who is with us today. And I was not happy with the way that information was given.\par \par \uc2 He didn't have to do that, because what he did wasn't wrong -- what he did in terms of the information he saw. What was wrong was the way that other people, including yourselves in this room, were given that information, because that was classified information that was given illegally. That's the real problem.\par \par \uc2 And, you know, you can talk all you want about Russia, which was all a, you know, fake news, fabricated deal, to try and make up for the loss of the Democrats and the press plays right into it. In fact, I saw a couple of the people that were supposedly involved with all of this -- that they know nothing about it; they weren't in Russia; they never made a phone call to Russia; they never received a phone call.\par \par \uc2 It's all fake news. It's all fake news. The nice thing is, I see it starting to turn, where people are now looking at the illegal -- I think it's very important -- the illegal, giving out classified information. It was -- and let me just tell you, it was given out like so much.\par \par \uc2 I'll give you an example. I called, as you know, Mexico. It was a very, very confidential, classified call. But I called Mexico. And in calling Mexico, I figured, oh, well that's -- I spoke to the president of Mexico; I had a good call. All of a sudden, it's out there for the world to see. It's supposed to be secret. It's supposed to be either confidential or classified, in that case.\par \par \uc2 Same thing with Australia. All of a sudden, people are finding out exactly what took place. The same thing happened with respect to General Flynn. Everybody saw this. And I'm saying -- the first thing I thought of when I heard about it is: How does the press get this information that's classified? How do they do it?\par \par \uc2 You know why? Because it's an illegal process and the press should be ashamed of themselves. But more importantly, the people that gave out the information to the press should be ashamed of themselves, really ashamed.\par \par \uc2 Yes, go ahead.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Because when I looked at the information, I said, "I don't think he did anything wrong; if anything, he did something right." He was coming into office. He looked at the information. He said, "Huh, that's fine." That's what they're supposed to do. They're supposed to -- he didn't just call Russia. He called and spoke to both ways, I think there were 30-some-odd countries. He's doing the job.\par \par \uc2 You know, he was doing his job. The thing is, he didn't tell our vice president properly, and then he said he didn't remember. So either way, it wasn't very satisfactory to me. And I have somebody that I think will be outstanding for the position. And that also helps, I think, in the making of my decision.\par \par \uc2 But he didn't tell the vice president of the United States the facts. And then he didn't remember. And that just wasn't acceptable to me.\par \par \uc2 Yes?\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: (inaudible) clarification here. During your campaign, did anyone from your team (inaudible) Russian government or Russian intelligence? And if so, what was the nature of those conversations (inaudible)?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: The failing \uc2 New York Times\uc2  wrote a big, long front-page story yesterday. And it was very much discredited, as you know. It was -- it's a joke. And the people mentioned in the story, I notice they were on television today saying they never even spoke to Russia. They weren't even a part, really -- I mean, they were such a minor part. They -- I hadn't spoken to them.\par \par \uc2 I think the one person -- I don't think I've ever spoken to him. I don't think I've ever met him. And he actually said he was a very low-level member of I think a committee for a short period of time. I don't think I ever met him. Now, it's possible that I walked into a room and he was sitting there, but I don't think I ever met him. I didn't talk to him ever. And he thought it was a joke.\par \par \uc2 The other person said he never spoke to Russia; never received a call. Look at his phone records, et cetera, et cetera. And the other person, people knew that he represented various countries, but I don't think he represented Russia, but knew that he represented various countries. That's what he does. I mean, people know that.\par \par \uc2 That's Mr. Manafort, who's -- by the way, who's by the way a respected man. He's a respected man. But I think he represented the Ukraine or Ukraine government or somebody, but everybody -- people knew that. Everybody knew that.\par \par \uc2 So, these people -- and he said that he has absolutely nothing to do and never has with Russia. And he said that very forcefully. I saw his statement. He said it very forcefully. Most of the papers don't print it because that's not good for their stories.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: So the three people that they talked about all totally deny it. And I can tell you, speaking for myself, I own nothing in Russia. I have no loans in Russia. I don't have any deals in Russia. President Putin called me up very nicely to congratulate me on the win of the election.\par \par \uc2 He then, called me up extremely nicely to congratulate me on the inauguration, which was terrific. But so did many other leaders, almost all other leaders from almost all of the country. So that's the extent.\par \par \uc2 Russia is fake news. Russia -- this is fake news put out by the media. The real news is the fact that people, probably from the Obama administration because they're there, because we have our new people going in place, right now.\par \par \uc2 As you know, Mike Pompeo has -- has now taken control of the CIA, James Comey at \uc2 FBI\uc2 , Dan Coats is waiting to be approved, I mean he is a senator and a highly respected one and he's still waiting to be approved. But our new people are going in.\par \par \uc2 And just while you're at it, because you mentioned this, Wall Street Journal did a story today that was almost as disgraceful as the failing New York Time's story, yesterday. And it talked about -- these are (ph) front page.\par \par \uc2 So director of national intelligence just put out, acting a statement, any suggestion that the United States intelligence community, this was just given to us, is withholding information and not providing the best possible intelligence to the president and his national security team is not true.\par \par \uc2 So they took this front page story out of The Wall Street Journal top and they just wrote the story that its not true. And I'll tell you something, I'll be honest, because I sort of enjoy this back and forth that I guess I have all my life but I've never seen more dishonest media than frankly, the political media. I thought the financial media was much better, much more honest.\par \par \uc2 But I will say that, I never get phone calls from the media. How did they write a story like that in The Wall Street Journal without asking me or how did they write a story in The \uc2 New York Times\uc2 , put it on front page?\par \par \uc2 That was like the story they wrote about the women and me, front page, big massive story. And it was nasty and then they called, they said we never said that, we like Mr. Trump. They called up my office, we like Mr. Trump, we never said that.\par \par \uc2 And it was totally -- they totally misrepresented those very wonderful women, I have to tell you, totally misrepresented. I said give us the retraction. They never gave us a retraction and frankly, I then went on to other things.\par \par \uc2 OK, go ahead.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE) said today that you have big intellectual margins (inaudible) 300 or more (ph), or 350 (ph) electoral (ph) votes. President Obama about 365 (OFF-MIKE).\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Yeah.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Obama (OFF-MIKE) 426 on (OFF-MIKE). So why should Americans...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: ...I'm skipping that information, I don't know, I was just given (ph) we had a very, very big margin.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE) why should Americans trust you (OFF-MIKE) the information (OFF-MIKE)?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Well, I don't know, I was given that information. I was given -- I actually, I've seen that information around. But it was a very substantial victory, do you agree with that? OK thank you, that's...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Go ahead Sir, yes?\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Can you tell us in determining that Lieutenant General Flynn did -- whether there was no wrongdoing in your mind, what evidence was weighed? Did you ask for transcripts of these telephone intercepts with Russian officials, particularly the Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, who he was communicating with?\par \par \uc2 What-- what evidence did you weigh to determine that there was no wrongdoing? Further to that, Sir, you said on a couple of locations this morning, you are going to aggressively pursue the source of these leaks.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: We are.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Can we ask what you're going to do and also, we've heard about a -- a review of the intelligence community headed up by Steven Feinberg, what can you tell us about that?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Well, first of all about that, we now have Dan Coats, hopefully soon, Mike Pompeo and James Comey and they're in position so I hope that we'll be able to straighten that out without using anybody else.\par \par \uc2 The gentleman you mentioned is a very talented man, very successful man and he's offered his services and you know, it's something we may take advantage of. But I don't think we're need that at all because of the fact that you know, I think that we are gonna be able to straighten it out very easily on its own.\par \par \uc2 As far as the general's concerned, when I first heard about it, I said huh, that doesn't sound wrong. My counsel came, Don McGahn, White House Counsel, and he told me and I asked him, he can speak very well for himself. He said he doesn't think anything is wrong, you know, really didn't think.\par \par \uc2 It was really, what happened after that but he didn't think anything was done wrong. I didn't either because I waited a period of time and I started to think about it, I said "well I don't see" -- to me, he was doing the job.\par \par \uc2 The information was provided by -- who I don't know, Sally Yates. And I was a little surprised because I said "doesn't sound like he did anything wrong there." But he did something wrong with respect to the vice president and I thought that was not acceptable. As far as -- as far as the actual making the call, fact I've watched various programs and I've read various articles where he was just doing his job.\par \par \uc2 That was very normal. You know, first everybody got excited because they thought he did something wrong. After they thought about it, it turned out he was just doing his job. So -- and I do. And by the way, with all of that being said, I do think he's a fine man.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Sir, if I could, on the leaks -- on the leaks, sir...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: ...Go ahead. Finish off then I'll get you.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: I'm sorry. What will you do on the leaks? You've said twice today...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: ...Yes, we're looking at them very -- very, very serious. I've gone to all of the folks in charge of the various agencies and we're -- I've actually called the Justice Department to look into the leaks. Those are criminal leaks. They're put out by people either in agencies -- I think you'll see it stopping because now we have our people in. You know, again, we don't have our people in because we can't get them approved by the Senate.\par \par \uc2 We just had Jeff Sessions approved. Injustice, as an example (ph). So, we are looking into that very seriously. It's a criminal act. You know what I say, when I -- when I was called out on Mexico, I was shocked because all this equipment, all this incredible phone equipment -- when I was called out on Mexico, I was -- honestly, I was really, really surprised.\par \par \uc2 But I said "you know, it doesn't make sense. That won't happen" but that wasn't that important a call, it was fine, I could show it to the world and he could show it to the world, the president who's a very fine man, by the way. Same thing with Australia. I said "that's terrible that it was leaked" but it wasn't that important. But then I said to myself "what happens when I'm dealing with the problem of North Korea?"\par \par \uc2 What happens when I'm dealing with the problems in the Middle East? Are you folks going to be reporting all of that very, very confidential information, very important, very -- you know, I mean at the highest level? Are you going to be reporting about that too? So, I don't want classified information getting out to the public and in a way that was almost a test.\par \par \uc2 So I'm dealing with Mexico, I'm dealing with Argentina, we were dealing on this case with Mike Flynn. All this information gets put into the "\uc2 Washington Post\uc2 " and gets put into the "\uc2 New York Times\uc2 " and I'm saying "what's going to happen when I'm dealing on the Middle East? What's going to happen when I'm dealing with really, really important subjects like North Korea?\par \par \uc2 We got to stop it. That's why it's a criminal penalty.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: I just want to get you to clarify this very important point. Can you say definitively that nobody on your campaign had any contacts with the Russians during the campaign? And on the leaks, is it fake news or are these real leaks?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Well the leaks are real. You're the one that wrote about them and reported them, I mean the leaks are real. You know what they said, you saw it and the leaks are absolutely real. The news is fake because so much of the news is fake. So one thing that I felt it was very important to do -- and I hope we can correct it. Because there's nobody I have more respect for -- well, maybe a little bit but the reporters, good reporters.\par \par \uc2 It's very important to me and especially in this position. It's very important. I don't mind bad stories. I can handle a bad story better than anybody as long as it's true and, you know, over a course of time, I'll make mistakes and you'll write badly and I'm OK with that. But I'm not OK when it is fake. I mean, I watch \uc2 CNN\uc2 , it's so much anger and hatred and just the hatred.\par \par \uc2 I don't watch it any more because it's very good -- he's saying no. It's OK, Jim (ph). It's OK, Jim (ph), you'll have your chance. But I watch others too. You're not the only one so don't feel badly. But I think it should be straight. I think it should be -- I think it would be frankly more interesting. I know how good everybody's ratings are right now but I think that actually -- I think that'd actually be better.\par \par \uc2 People -- I mean, you have a lower approval rate than Congress. I think that's right. I don't know, Peter (ph), is that one right? Because you know I think they have lower -- I heard lower than Congress. But honestly, the public would appreciate it, I'd appreciate it -- again, I don't mind bad stories when it's true but we have an administration where the Democrats are making it very difficult.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I think we're setting a record or close to a record in the time of approval of a cabinet. I mean, the numbers are crazy. When I'm looking, some of them had them approved immediately.\par \par \uc2 I'm going forever and I still have a lot of people that we're waiting for. And that's all they're doing, is delaying. And you look at Schumer and the mess that he's got over there and they have nothing going. The only thing they can do is delay. And, you know, I think that they'd be better served by, you know, approving and making sure that they're happy and everybody's good.\par \par \uc2 And sometimes -- I mean, I know President Obama lost three or four, and you lose them on the way, and that's OK. That's fine. But I think it would -- I think they would be much better served, John, if they just went through the process quickly. This is pure delay tactics.\par \par \uc2 And they say it, and everybody understands it. Yeah, go ahead, Jimmy.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Well, I had nothing to do with it. I have nothing to do with Russia. I told you, I have no deals there, I have no anything. Now, when \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2 , which I had nothing to do with, comes out and happens to give, they're not giving classified information. They're giving stuff -- what was said at an office about Hillary cheating on the debates.\par \par \uc2 Which, by the way, nobody mentions. Nobody mentions that Hillary received the questions to the debates. Can you imagine -- seriously -- can you imagine if I received the questions? It would be the electric chair. OK, he should be put in the electric -- you would even call for the reinstitution of the death penalty, OK. Maybe not you John. Yes? We'll do you next Jim, I do you next(ph).\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE) clarify --\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Yes, yes, sure\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Did you direct Mike Flynn to discuss sanctions with the Russian ambassador --\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: No, I didn't.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: -- prior to your --\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: No, I didn't.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: -- inauguration.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: No, I didn't.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: And then fired him --\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Excuse me.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: No, I fired him because of what he said to \uc2 Mike Pence\uc2 . Very simple. Mike was doing his job. He was calling countries and his counterparts. So, it certainly would have been OK with me if he did it. I would have directed him to do it if I thought he wasn't doing it.\par \par \uc2 I didn't direct him, but I would have directed him because that's his job. And it came out that way -- and in all fairness, I watched Dr. Charles Krauthammer the other night say he was doing his job and I agreed with him. And since then, I've watched many other people say that.\par \par \uc2 No, I didn't direct him, but I would have directed him if he didn't do it. OK? Jim?\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Thank you very much, and just for the record, we don't hate you. I don't hate you.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: OK.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: So, pass that along --\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Ask -- ask \uc2 Jeff Zucker\uc2  how he got his job. OK?\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: If I may follow up on some of the questions that have taken place so far here, sir --\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Well, that's -- well, you know, we do have other people. You do have other people and your ratings aren't as good as some of the other people that are waiting.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: It's pretty good right now, actually.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: OK, go ahead, John.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: If I may ask, sir, you said earlier that \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  was revealing information about the \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  campaign during the election cycle. You welcomed that. At one time --\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I was OK with it.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: -- you said -- you said that you loved \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2 . At another campaign press conference you called on the Russians to find the missing 30,000 e-mails. I'm wondering, sir, if you --\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Well, she was actually missing 33 and then that got extended with a pile after that.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Then(ph), your(ph) numbers(ph) were off too.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: No -- no, but I did say 30. But it was actually higher than that.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: If -- if I may ask you, sir, it -- it sounds as though you do not have much credibility here when it comes to leaking if that is something that you encouraged during(ph) the campaign --\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: OK, fair question. Ready?\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Well, if I may ask you that --\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: No -- no, but let me do one at a time.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: If I may as a follow up?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Do you mind?\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Yes, sir.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: All right. So, in one case, you're talking about highly classified information. In the other case, you're talking about \uc2 John Podesta\uc2  saying bad things about the boss. I will say this, if \uc2 John Podesta\uc2  said that about me and he was working for me, I would have fired him so fast your head would have spun.\par \par \uc2 He said terrible things about her. But it wasn't classified information. But in one case, you're talking about classified -- regardless, if you look at the RNC, we had a very strong -- at my suggestion -- and I give Reince great credit for this -- at my suggestion, because I know something about this world, I said I want a very strong defensive mechanism.\par \par \uc2 I don't want to be hacked. And we did that. And you have seen that they tried to hack us and they failed. The DNC did not do that. And if they did it, they could not have been hacked. But they were hacked and terrible things came in. And, you know, the only thing that I do think is unfair is some of the things were so -- they were -- when I heard some of those things I picked up the papers the next morning and said, oh, this is going to be front page, it wasn't even in the papers.\par \par \uc2 Again, if I had that happen to me, it would be the biggest story in the history of publishing or the head of newspapers. I would have been headline in every newspaper. I mean, think of it. They gave her the questions to a debate and she -- and she should have reported herself.\par \par \uc2 Why did \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  announce that, "I'm sorry, but I have been given the questions to a debate or a town hall, and I feel that it's inappropriate, and I want to turn in \uc2 CNN\uc2  for not doing a good job."\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: And if I may follow up on that, just something that Jonathan Karl (ph) was asking you about. You said that the leaks are real, but the news is fake. I guess I don't understand. It seems that there's a disconnect there. If the information coming from those leaks is real, then how can the stories be fake?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: The reporting is fake. Look, look...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: You know what it is? Here's the thing. The public isn't -- you know, they read newspapers, they see television, they watch. They don't know if it's true or false because they're not involved. I'm involved. I've been involved with this stuff all my life. But I'm involved. So I know when you're telling the truth or when you're not. I just see many, many untruthful things.\par \par \uc2 And I'll tell you what else I see. I see tone. You know the word "tone." The tone is such hatred. I'm really not a bad person, by the way. No, but the tone is such -- I do get good ratings, you have to admit that -- the tone is such hatred.\par \par \uc2 I watched this morning a couple of the networks. And I have to say, Fox & Friends in the morning, they're very honorable people. They're very -- not because they're good, because they hit me also when I do something wrong. But they have the most honest morning show. That's all I can say. It's the most honest.\par \par \uc2 But the tone, Jim. If you look -- the hatred. The, I mean, sometimes -- sometimes somebody gets...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Well, you look at your show that goes on at 10 o'clock in the evening. You just take a look at that show. That is a constant hit. The panel is almost always exclusive anti-Trump. The good news is he doesn't have good ratings. But the panel is almost exclusive anti-Trump. And the hatred and venom coming from his mouth; the hatred coming from other people on your network.\par \par \uc2 Now, I will say this. I watch it. I see it. I'm amazed by it. And I just think you'd be a lot better off, I honestly do. The public gets it, you know. Look, when I go to rallies, they turn around, they start screaming at \uc2 CNN\uc2 . They want to throw their placards at \uc2 CNN\uc2 . You know.\par \par \uc2 I -- I think you would do much better by being different. But you just take a look. Take a look at some of your shows in the morning and the evening. If a guest comes out and says something positive about me, it's -- it's brutal.\par \par \uc2 Now, they'll take this news conference -- I'm actually having a very good time, OK? But they'll take this news conference -- don't forget, that's the way I won. Remember, I used to give you a news conference every time I made a speech, which was like every day. OK?\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: No, that's how I won. I won with news conferences and probably speeches. I certainly didn't win by people listening to you people. That's for sure. But I'm having a good time.\par \par \uc2 Tomorrow, they will say, "\uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  rants and raves at the press." I'm not ranting and raving. I'm just telling you. You know, you're dishonest people. But -- but I'm not ranting and raving. I love this. I'm having a good time doing it.\par \par \uc2 But tomorrow, the headlines are going to be, "\uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  rants and raves." I'm not ranting and raving.\par \par \uc2 Go ahead.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: If I may, just one more followup...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Should I let him have a little bit more? What do you think, Peter? Peter, should I have -- let him have a little bit more?\par \par \uc2 Sit down. Sit down. We'll...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Just because of the attack of fake news and attacking our network, I just want to ask you, sir...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I'm changing it from fake news, though.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Doesn't that under...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Very fake news.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: ... I know, but aren't you...\par \par \uc2 (LAUGHTER)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Go ahead.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Real news, Mr. President, real news.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: And you're not related to our new...\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: I am not related, sir. No. I do like the sound of Secretary Acosta, I must say.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I looked -- you know, I looked at that name. I said, wait a minute, is there any relation there? Alex Acosta.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: I'm sure you checked that out, sir.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: OK. Now I checked it -- I said -- they said, "No, sir." I said, "Do me a favor, go back and check the family tree."\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: But aren't you -- aren't you concerned, sir, that you are undermining the people's faith in the First Amendment, freedom of the press, the press in this country, when you call stories you don't like "fake news"? Why not just say it's a story I don't like.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I do that.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: When you call it "fake news," you're undermining confidence in our news media (inaudible) important.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: No, no. I do that. Here's the thing. OK. I understand what you're -- and you're right about that, except this. See, I know when I should get good and when I should get bad. And sometimes I'll say, "Wow, that's going to be a great story." And I'll get killed.\par \par \uc2 I know what's good and bad. I'd be a pretty good reporter, not as good as you. But I know what's good. I know what's bad. And when they change it and make it really bad, something that should be positive -- sometimes something that should be very positive, they'll make OK. They'll even make it negative.\par \par \uc2 So I understand it. So, because I'm there. I know what was said. I know who's saying it. I'm there. So it's very important to me.\par \par \uc2 Look, I want to see an honest press. When I started off today by saying that it's so important to the public to get an honest press. The press -- the public doesn't believe you people anymore. Now, maybe I had something to do with that. I don't know. But they don't believe you. If you were straight and really told it like it is, as Howard Cosell used to say, right?\par \par \uc2 Of course, he had some questions also. But if you were straight, I would be your biggest booster. I would be your biggest fan in the world, including bad stories about me. But if you go - as an example, you're \uc2 CNN\uc2 , I mean it's story after story after story is bad. I won. I won. And the other thing, chaos because zero chaos. We are running - this is a fine-tuned machine and Reince happens to be doing a good job but half of his job is putting out lies by the press (ph).\par \par \uc2 You know, I said to him yesterday this whole Russia scam that you guys are building so that you don't talk about the real subject which is illegal leaks, but I watched him yesterday working so hard to try and get that story proper. And I'm saying "here's my chief of staff," a really good guy, did a phenomenal job at RNC. I mean, he won the election, right?\par \par \uc2 We won the presidency. We got some senators, we got some - all over the country, you take a look, he's done a great job. And I said to myself, you know - and I said to somebody that was in the room, I said "you take a look at Reince, he's working so hard just putting out fires that are fake fires." I mean, they're fake. They're not true. And isn't that a shame because he'd rather be working on healthcare, he'd rather be working on tax reform, Jim (ph).\par \par \uc2 I mean that. I would be your biggest fan in the world if you treated me right. I sort of understand there's a certain bias maybe by Jeff (ph) or somebody, you know - you know, whatever reason. But - and I understand that. But you've got to be at least a little bit fair and that's why the public sees it. They see it. They see it's not fair. You take a look at some of your shows and you see the bias and the hatred.\par \par \uc2 And the public is smart, they understand it. Go ahead.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: (inaudible) ...for those who believe that there is something to it, is there anything that you have learned over the last few weeks that you might be able to reveal that might ease their concerns that this isn't fake news? And second...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: ...I think they don't believe it. I don't think the public - that's why the Rasmussen poll just has me through the roof. I don't think they believe it. Well, I guess one of the reasons I'm here today is to tell you the whole Russian thing, that's a ruse. That's a ruse. And by the way, it would be great if we could get along with Russia, just so you understand that.\par \par \uc2 Now tomorrow, you'll say "\uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  wants to get along with Russia, this is terrible." It's not terrible. It's good. We had \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  try and do a reset. We had \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  give Russia 20 percent of the uranium in our country. You know what uranium is, right? This thing called nuclear weapons like lots of things are done with uranium including some bad things.\par \par \uc2 Nobody talks about that. I didn't do anything for Russia. I've done nothing for Russia. \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  gave them 20 percent of our uranium. \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  did a reset, remember? With the stupid plastic button that made us all look like a bunch of jerks. Here, take a look. He looked at her like, what the hell is she doing with that cheap plastic button?\par \par \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  - that was the reset, remember it said reset? Now if I do that, oh, I'm a bad guy. If we could get along with Russia, that's a positive thing. We have a very talented man, \uc2 Rex Tillerson\uc2 , who's going to be meeting with them shortly and I told him. I said "I know politically it's probably not good for me." The greatest thing I could do is shoot that ship that's 30 miles off shore right out of the water.\par \par \uc2 Everyone in this country's going to say "oh, it's so great." That's not great. That's not great. I would love to be able to get along with Russia. Now, you've had a lot of presidents that haven't taken that tack. Look where we are now. Look where we are now. So, if I can - now, I love to negotiate things, I do it really well, and all that stuff. But - but it's possible I won't be able to get along with Putin.\par \par \uc2 Maybe it is. But I want to just tell you, the false reporting by the media, by you people, the false, horrible, fake reporting makes it much harder to make a deal with Russia. And probably Putin said "you know." He's sitting behind his desk and he's saying "you know, I see what's going on in the United States, I follow it closely. It's going to be impossible for President Trump to ever get along with Russia because of all the pressure he's got with this fake story." OK?\par \par \uc2 And that's a shame because if we could get along with Russia - and by the way, China and Japan and everyone. If we could get along, it would be a positive thing, not a negative thing.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Is tax reform on the line (ph)?\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Mr. President? Mr. President? Mr. President, since you...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Tax reform is going to happen fairly quickly. We're doing Obamacare. We're in final stages. We should be submitting the initial plan in March, early March, I would say. And we have to, as you know, statutorily and for reasons of budget, we have to go first. It's not like, frankly, the tax would be easier, in my opinion, but for statutory reasons and for budgetary reasons, we have to submit the healthcare sooner.\par \par \uc2 So we'll be submitting healthcare sometime in early March, mid- March. And after that, we're going to come up, and we're doing very well on tax reform.\par \par \uc2 Yes?\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Mr. President, you mentioned Russia. Let's talk about some serious issues that have come up in the last week that you have had to deal with as president of the United States.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: OK.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: You mentioned the vessel -- the spy vessel off the coast of the United States.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Not good.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: There was a ballistic missile test that many interpret as a violation of an agreement between the two countries; and a Russian plane buzzed a U.S. destroyer.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Not good.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: I listened to you during the campaign ...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Excuse me, excuse me. When did it happen? It happened when, if you were Putin right now, you would say, "Hey, we're back to the old games with the United States; there's no way Trump can ever do a deal with us." Because the -- you have to understand. If I was just brutal on Russia right now, just brutal, people would say, you would say, "Oh, isn't that wonderful." But I know you well enough.\par \par \uc2 Then you would say, "Oh, he was too tough; he shouldn't have done that." Look, all of the...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: I'm just trying to find out your orientation to those...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Wait a minute. Wait, wait. Excuse me just one second.\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: All of those things that you mentioned are very recent, because probably Putin assumes that he's not going to be able to make a deal with me because it's politically not popular for me to make a deal. So \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  tries a re-set. It failed. They all tried. But I'm different than those people.\par \par \uc2 Go ahead.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: How are you interpreting those moves? And what do you intend to do about them? Have you given \uc2 Rex Tillerson\uc2  any advice or counsel on how to deal?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I have. I have. And I'm so beautifully represented. I'm so honored that the Senate approved him. He's going to be fantastic.\par \par \uc2 Yes, I think that I've already...\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Is Putin testing you, do you believe, sir?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: No, I don't think so. I think Putin probably assumes that he can't make a deal with me anymore because politically it would be unpopular for a politician to make a deal. I can't believe I'm saying I'm a politician, but I guess that's what I am now.\par \par \uc2 Because, look, it would be much easier for me to be tough on Russia, but then we're not going to make a deal.\par \par \uc2 Now, I don't know that we're going to make a deal. I don't know. We might. We might not. But it would be much easier for me to be so tough -- the tougher I am on Russia, the better. But you know what? I want to do the right thing for the American people. And to be honest, secondarily, I want to do the right thing for the world.\par \par \uc2 If Russia and the United States actually got together and got along -- and don't forget, we're a very powerful nuclear country and so are they. There's no up-side. We're a very powerful nuclear country and so are they. I have been briefed. And I can tell you one thing about a briefing that we're allowed to say because anybody that ever read the most basic book can say it, nuclear holocaust would be like no other.\par \par \uc2 They're a very powerful nuclear country and so are we. If we have a good relationship with Russia, believe me, that's a good thing, not a bad thing.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: So when you say they're not good, do you mean that they are...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Who did I say is not good?\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: No, I read off the three things that have recently happened. Each one of them you said they're not good.\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: No, it's not good, but they happened.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: But do they damage the relationship? Do they undermine...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: They all happened recently.\par \par \uc2 No...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: ... this country's ability to work with Russia?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: They all happened recently. And I understand what they're doing because they're doing the same thing.\par \par \uc2 Now, again, maybe I'm not going to be able to do a deal with Russia, but at least I will have tried. And if I don't, does anybody really think that \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  would be tougher on Russia than \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 ? Does anybody in this room really believe that? OK?\par \par \uc2 But I tell you one thing, she tried to make a deal. She had the re-set. She gave all that valuable uranium away. She did other things. You know, they say I'm close to Russia. \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  gave away 20 percent of the uranium in the United States. She's close to Russia.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Can we...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I gave -- you know what I gave to Russia? You know what I gave? Nothing.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Can we conclude there will be no response to these particular provocations?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: I'm not going to tell you anything about what response I do. I don't talk about military response. I don't say I'm going into Mosul in four months. "We are going to attack Mosul in four months." Then three months later, "We are going to attack Mosul in one month." ''Next week, we are going to attack Mosul."\par \par \uc2 In the meantime, Mosul is very, very difficult. Do you know why? Because I don't talk about military, and I don't talk about certain other things, you're going to be surprised to hear that. And by the way, my whole campaign, I'd say that. So I don't have to tell you. I don't want to be one of these guys that say, "Yes, here's what we're going to do." I don't have to do that. I don't have to tell you what I'm going to do in North Korea.\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Wait a minute. I don't have to tell you what I'm going to do in North Korea. And I don't have to tell you what I'm going to do with Iran. You know why? Because they shouldn't know. And eventually, you guys are going to get tired of asking that question.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: So when you ask me what am I going to do with a ship, the Russian ship as an example, I'm not going to tell you. But hopefully, I won't have to do anything, but I'm not going to tell you.\par \par \uc2 OK.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Could I just ask you -- thank you very much, Mr. President. The trouble...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Where are you from?\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: \uc2 BBC\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Here's another beauty.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: That's a good line. Impartial, free and fair.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Yeah. Sure.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Mr. President...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Just like \uc2 CNN\uc2  right?\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: On the travel ban -- we could banter back and forth. On the travel ban would you accept that that was a good example of the smooth running of government...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Yeah, I do. I do. Let me tell you about this government...\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Were there any mistakes...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Wait. Wait. I know who you are. Just wait.\par \par \uc2 Let me tell you about the travel ban. We had a very smooth rollout of the travel ban. But we had a bad court. Got a bad decision. We had a court that's been overturned. Again, may be wrong. But I think it's 80 percent of the time, a lot.\par \par \uc2 We had a bad decision. We're going to keep going with that decision. We're going to put in a new executive order next week some time. But we had a bad decision.\par \par \uc2 That's the other thing that was wrong with the travel ban. You had Delta with a massive problem with their computer system at the airports. You had some people that were put out there, brought by very nice busses, and they were put out at various locations.\par \par \uc2 Despite that the only problem that we had is we had a bad court. We had a court that gave us what I consider to be, with great respect, a very bad decision. Very bad for the safety and security of our country. The rollout was perfect.\par \par \uc2 Now, what I wanted to do was do the exact same executive order, but said one thing. I said this to my people. Give them a one-month period of time. But Gen. Kelly, now Sec. Kelly, said if you do that, all these people will come in and (inaudible) the bad ones.\par \par \uc2 You do agree there are bad people out there, right? That not everybody that's like you. You have some bad people out there.\par \par \uc2 Kelly said you can't do that. And he was right. As soon as he said it I said wow, never thought of it. I said how about one week? He said no good. You got to do it immediately because if you do it immediately they don't have time to come in.\par \par \uc2 Now nobody ever reports that. But that's why we did it quickly.\par \par \uc2 Now, if I would've done it a month, everything would've been perfect. The problem is we would've wasted a lot of time, and maybe a lot of lives because a lot of bad people would've come into our country.\par \par \uc2 Now in the meantime, we're vetting very, very strongly. Very, very strongly. But we need help. And we need help by getting that executive order passed.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Just a brief follow-up. But if it's so urgent, why not introduce...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Yes? Go ahead.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Thank you. I was just hoping that we could get a yes or no answer on one of these questions involving Russia. Can you say whether you are aware that anyone who advised your campaign had contacts with Russia during the course of the election?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Well I told you, Gen. Flynn obviously was dealing. So that's one person. But he was dealing, as he should have been.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: During the election?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: No. Nobody that I know of. Nobody...\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: So you're not aware of any contact during the course..\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Look, look, look...\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: ... of the election?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: How many times do I have to answer this question?\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Can you just say yes or no?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Russia is a ruse.\par \par \uc2 I know you have to get up and ask a question. It's so important.\par \par \uc2 Russia is a ruse. I have nothing to do with Russia. Haven't made a phone call to Russia in years. Don't speak to people from Russia. Not that I wouldn't. I just have nobody to speak to.\par \par \uc2 I spoke to Putin twice. He called me on the election. I told you this. And he called me on the inauguration, a few days ago.\par \par \uc2 We had a very good talk, especially the second one, lasted for a pretty long period of time. I'm sure you probably get it because it was classified. So I'm sure everybody in this room perhaps has it. But we had a very, very good talk.\par \par \uc2 I have nothing to do with Russia. To the best of my knowledge no person that I deal with does.\par \par \uc2 Now, Manafort has totally denied it. He denied it. Now people knew that he was a consultant over in that part of the world for a while, but not for Russia. I think he represented Ukraine or people having to do with Ukraine, or people that -- whoever. But people knew that. Everybody knew that.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: But in his capacity as your campaign manager, was he in touch with Russian officials during the election?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: You know what? He said no. I could only tell you what he -- now he was replaced long before the election. You know that, right?\par \par \uc2 He was replaced long before the election. When all of this stuff started coming out, it came out during the election. But \uc2 Paul Manafort\uc2 , who's a good man also by the way, Paul Manfort was replaced long before the election took place. He was only there for a short period of time.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Mr. President...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: How much longer should we stay here, folks?\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Mr. President...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Five more minutes. Is that OK? Five?\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Mr. President, on national...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Wait. Let's see. Who's -- I want to find a friendly reporter.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Mr....\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Are you a friendly reporter? Watch how friendly he is. Wait. Wait. Watch how friendly he is. Go ahead.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Go ahead.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: So first of all, my name is (Inaudible) from (Inaudible) Magazine. I (inaudible). I haven't seen anybody in my community, including yourself or any of the -- anyone on your staff of being (OFF-MIKE).\par \par \uc2 Because (OFF-MIKE). However, what we've already heard about and what we (OFF-MIKE) is (OFF-MIKE) so you're general forecast (ph) like 48 (OFF-MIKE). There are people who are everything (ph) happens through their packs (ph) is one of the (OFF-MIKE)...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP:...he said he was gonna ask a very simple, easy question. And it's not, its not, not -- not a simple question, not a fair question. OK sit down, I understand the rest of your question.\par \par \uc2 So here's the story, folks. Number one, I am the least anti- Semitic person that you've ever seen in your entire life. Number two, racism, the least racist person. In fact, we did very well relative to other people running as a Republican -- quiet, quiet, quiet.\par \par \uc2 See, he lied about -- he was gonna get up and ask a very straight, simple question, so you know, welcome to the world of the media. But let me just tell you something, that I hate the charge, I find it repulsive.\par \par \uc2 I hate even the question because people that know me and you heard the prime minister, you heard Ben Netanyahu (ph) yesterday, did you hear him, Bibi? He said, I've known \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  for a long time and then he said, forget it.\par \par \uc2 So you should take that instead of having to get up and ask a very insulting question like that.\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Yeah, go ahead. Go ahead.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Thank you, I'm Lisa (ph) from the...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: See, it just shows you about the press, but that's the way the press is.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. President. Lisa Dejardown (ph) from the \uc2 PBS\uc2  News Hour. On national security and immigration, can you give us more details on the executive order you plan for next week? Even its broad outlines?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Yeah.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Will it be focused on specific...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: It's a very fair question.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: ...countries? And in addition, on the DACA program for immigration.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Right.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: What is your plan, do you plan to continue that program or to end it?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: We're gonna show great heart, DACA is a very, very difficult subject for me, I will tell you. To me, it's one of the most difficult subjects I have because you have these incredible kids.\par \par \uc2 In many cases, not in all cases. And some of the cases, having DACA and they're gang members and they're drug dealers, too. But you have some absolutely, incredible kids, I would say mostly. They were brought here in such a way -- it's a very -- it's a very, very tough subject.\par \par \uc2 We're gonna deal with DACA with heart. I have to deal with a lot of politicians, don't forget and I have to convince them that what I'm saying is -- is right. And I appreciate your understanding on that.\par \par \uc2 But the DACA situation is a very, very -- it's a very difficult thing for me because you know, I love these kids, I love kids, I have kids and grandkids. And I find it very, very hard doing what the law says exactly to do and you know, the law is rough.\par \par \uc2 I'm not talking about new laws, I'm talking the existing law, is very rough, it's very, very rough. As far as the new order, the new order is going to be very much tailored to the what I consider to be a very bad decision.\par \par \uc2 But we can tailor the order to that decision and get just about everything, in some ways, more. But we're tailoring it now to the decision, we have some of the best lawyers in the country working on it.\par \par \uc2 And the new executive order, is being tailored to the decision we got down from the court. OK?\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Mr. President...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: ...reopening of the White House Visitors Office?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Yes.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: And she does a lot of great work for the country as well (ph). Can you talk a little bit about what's first for (ph) Melania Trump does for the country and (inaudible) so opening White House Visitors Office, what does that mean...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Now, that's what I call a nice question. That is very -- who are you with?\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Good, I'm gonna start watching, all right? Thank you very much. Melania's terrific, she was here last night, we had dinner with Senator Rubio and his wife who is by the way, lovely.\par \par \uc2 And we had a really good discussion about Cuba because we have very similar views on Cuba. And Cuba was very good to me in the Florida election, as you know the Cuban Americans. And I think that Melania's gonna be outstanding, that's right, she just opened up the visitors center, in other words, touring of the White House.\par \par \uc2 She, like others that she's working with, feel very, very strongly about women's issue, women's difficulties. Very, very strongly, she's a very, very strong advocate. I think she's a great representative for this country.\par \par \uc2 And a funny thing happens, because she gets -- she gets so unfairly -- Melania, the things they say. I've known her for a long time, she was a very successful person, she was a very successful model. She did really well.\par \par \uc2 She would go home at night and didn't even want to go out with people. She was a very private person. She was always the highest quality that you'll ever find. And the things they say -- I've known her for a long time -- the things they say are so unfair. And actually, she's been apologized to, as you know, by various media because they said things that were lies.\par \par \uc2 I'll just tell you this. I think she's going to be a fantastic first lady. She's going to be a tremendous representative of women and of the people. And helping her and working her will be Ivanka, who is a fabulous person and a fabulous, fabulous woman. And they're not doing this for money.\par \par \uc2 They're not doing this for pay, they're doing this because they feel it; both of them. And Melania goes back and forth and after Barron finishes school -- because it's hard to take a child out of school with a few months left -- she and Barron will be moving over to the White House. OK, thank you, that's a very nice question.\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Go ahead.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Mr. Trump?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Yes, oh, this is going to be a bad question, but that's OK.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: It doesn't(ph) have(ph) to be a bad question.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Good, because I enjoy watching you on television. Go ahead.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Well, thank you so much. Mr. President, I need to find out from you, you said something as it relates to inner cities. That was one of your platforms during your campaign. Now you're --\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Fix the inner cities.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: -- president. Fixing the inner cities.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Yep.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: What will be that fix and your urban agenda as well as your HBCU Executive Order that's coming out this afternoon? See, it wasn't bad, was it?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: That was very professional and very good.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: I'm very professional.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: We'll be announcing the order in a little while and I'd rather let the order speak for itself. But it could be something that I think that will be very good for everybody concerned. But we'll talk to you about that after we do the announcement. As far as the inner cities, as you know, I was very strong on the inner cities during the campaign.\par \par \uc2 I think it's probably what got me a much higher percentage of the African American vote than a lot of people thought I was going to get. We did, you know, much higher than people thought I was going to get. And I was honored by that, including the Hispanic vote, which was also much higher.\par \par \uc2 And by the way, if I might add, including the women's vote, which was much higher than people thought I was going to get. So, we are going to be working very hard on the inner cities, having to do with education, having to do with crime. We're going to try and fix as quickly as possible -- you know, it takes a long time.\par \par \uc2 It's taken more a hundred years and more for some of these places to evolve and they evolved, many of them, very badly. But we're going to be working very hard on health and healthcare, very, very hard on education, and also we're going to be working in a stringent way, in a very good way, on crime.\par \par \uc2 You go to some of these inner city places and it's so sad when you look at the crime. You have people -- and I've seen this, and I've sort of witnessed it -- in fact, in two cases I have actually witnessed it. They lock themselves into apartments, petrified to even leave, in the middle of the day.\par \par \uc2 They're living in hell. We can't let that happen. So, we're going to be very, very strong. That's a great question and -- and it's a -- it's a very difficult situation because it's been many, many years. It's been festering for many, many years. But we have places in this country that we have to fix.\par \par \uc2 We have to help African American people that, for the most part, are stuck there. Hispanic American people. We have Hispanic American people that are in the inner cities and their living in hell. I mean, you look at the numbers in Chicago. There are two Chicagos, as you know.\par \par \uc2 There's one Chicago that's incredible, luxurious and all -- and safe. There's another Chicago that's worse than almost any of the places in the Middle East that we talk, and that you talk about, every night on the newscasts. So, we're going to do a lot of work on the inner cities.\par \par \uc2 I have great people lined up to help with the inner cities. OK?\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Well, when you say the inner cities, are you going -- are you going to include the CBC, Mr. President, in your conversations with your -- your urban agenda, your inner city agenda, as well as --\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Am I going to include who?\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: Are you going to include the \uc2 Congressional Black Caucus\uc2  and the Congressional --\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Well, I would. I tell you what, do you want to set up the meeting?\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: -- Hispanic Caucus --\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Do you want to set up the meeting?\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: No -- no -- no. I'm not --\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Are they friends of yours?\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: I'm just a reporter.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Well, then(ph) set up the meeting.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: I know some of them, but I'm sure they're watching right now.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Let's go set up a meeting. I would love to meet with the Black Caucus. I think it's great, the \uc2 Congressional Black Caucus\uc2 . I think it's great. I actually thought I had a meeting with Congressman Cummings and he was all excited. And then he said, well, I can't move, it might be bad for me politically. I can't have that meeting.\par \par \uc2 I was all set to have the meeting. You know, we called him and called him. And he was all set. I spoke to him on the phone, very nice guy.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: I hear he wanted that meeting with you as well.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: He wanted it, but we called, called, called and can't make a meeting with him. Every day I walk and say I would like to meet with him because I do want to solve the problem. But he probably was told by Schumer or somebody like that, some other lightweight. He was probably told - he was probably told "don't meet with Trump. It's bad politics."\par \par \uc2 And that's part of the problem in this country. OK, one more.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: (inaudible)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: No, no, one question. Two we can't handle. This room can't handle two. Go ahead, give me the better of your two.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: (inaudible) ...not about your personality or your beliefs, talking about (inaudible), some of it by supporters in your name. What do you...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: ...And some of it - can I be honest with you? And this has to do with racism and horrible things that are put up. Some of it written by our opponents. You do know that. Do you understand that? You don't think anybody would do a thing like that. Some of the signs you'll see are not put up by the people that love or like \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 , they're put up by the other side and you think it's like playing it straight?\par \par \uc2 No. But you have some of those signs and some of that anger is caused by the other side. They'll do signs and they'll do drawings that are inappropriate. It won't be my people. It will be the people on the other side to anger people like you. OK.\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Go ahead, go ahead.\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: You're the president now. What are you going to do about it?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Who is that? Where is that?\par \par \uc2 QUESTION: What are you going to do about - what are you going to do about (inaudible).\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: Oh, I'm working on it. I'm working on it very - no, no, look. Hey, just so you understand, we had a totally divided country for eight years and long before that. In all fairness to President Obama, long before President Obama we have had a very divided - I didn't come along and divide this country. This country was seriously divided before I got here.\par \par \uc2 We're going to work on it very hard. One of the questions I was asked, I thought it was a very good question was about the inner cities. I mean, that's part of it. But we're going to work on education, we're going to work on - you know, we're going to stop - we're going to try and stop the crime. We have great law enforcement officials, we're going to try and stop crime.\par \par \uc2 We're not going to try and stop, we're going to stop crime. But it's very important to me - but this isn't \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  that divided a nation. We went eight years with President Obama and we went many years before President Obama. We lived in a divided nation. And I am going to try - I will do everything within my power to fix that. I want to thank everybody very much.\par \par \uc2 It's a great honor to be with you. Thank you. Thank you very much, thanks.\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020170216ed2g00g8b\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Here are excerpts from recent editorials in Texas newspapers:\par \par \uc2 Waco Tribune-Herald. Jan. 21, 2017.\par \par \uc2 Two days before the inauguration of President \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 , MSNBC's indomitable Chris Matthews asked Trump surrogate Steve Cortes about the political wisdom of Trump's tweet-storm condemning civil rights icon John Lewis, which only further aggravated racial tensions. Cortes explained that, whatever else, Trump voters relish Trump's combativeness:\par \par \uc2 "The reason people rallied to his fierceness (on the 2016 campaign trail) is because we have a rigged crony system right now which works very well for the people over in Davos (site of moneyed elites gathered for the \uc2 World Economic Forum\uc2 ), it works very well for Washington, D.C.," he said. "It's not working for Dayton, it's not working for Waco, Texas."\par \par \uc2 Fair point. We'll take that as an invitation from President Trump to highlight at least some of what's important in Waco, Texas, assuming he's really interested:\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 Poverty remains a massive problem for nearly a third of us, maybe more. We're not just talking about homeless people but folks who have jobs, yet remain one paycheck from economic ruin, including getting bounced from their lodgings. To the surprise of very few economists, trickle-down economics have failed millions of Americans. What else do you have up your sleeve, Mr. President? Is it time to talk of raising the minimum wage? How about some form of job subsidies? Can you use your considerable clout to shame employers into doing better by their employees?\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 Given the reports of backlogged claims snarling the Waco Veteran Affairs Regional Office a few years ago or the bungled rollout of the Affordable Care Act, our folks don't so much detest the federal government as governmental inefficiency, red tape and incompetence. Improve accountability by rank-and-file staff in a dysfunctional civil-service environment and you'll begin to improve governmental efficiency, maybe even to the level of your hotels and casinos.\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 Republican Congressman Bill Flores' earnest discussion with leaders in our construction, hospitality and high-tech industries regarding their heavy reliance on \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  labor justifies major reforms that expedite legal immigration and ensure efficient use of work visas for targeted industries. Even Flores' conservative followers see justice in doing right by the Dreamers. And any wall should be high-tech and virtual. Texans are funny about property rights. They should be respected \u8212\'20\'14 even if they have land on the Texas-Mexico line.\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 Think twice about breaking your campaign promise to Americans not to touch their Social Security and Medicare, including some chatter about signing whatever House Speaker \uc2 Paul Ryan\uc2  sends your way. Our folks labor under the idea they've actually paid into federal trusts. We learned this firsthand when we tried to justify the government's not allotting cost-of-living raises one year. Ouch!\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 Championing coal might have won you votes in West Virginia, but in ultra-conservative Central Texas, folks still frown on coal-fired power plants in close proximity. Such sentiments prompted even conservative state Rep. Charles "Doc" Anderson to inveigh against a proposal to permit nine such power plants within 50 miles of McLennan County a decade ago \u8212\'20\'14 his finest hour. Most of us want clean air, clean water.\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 Those of us who want the best for \uc2 Baylor University\uc2  appreciate the importance of Title IX protections to safeguard students from sexual aggression in all its horrid reforms, some of which have now hobbled this great university. But Republicans are right to be concerned about federal overreach in some of the guidelines, especially when they compromise due-process rights and turn academic settings into courtrooms.\par \par \uc2 You assure the masses you have not forgotten them. We'll be watching.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 El Paso Times. Jan. 21, 2017.\par \par \uc2 El Paso Independent School District stumbled in its ongoing efforts to rebuild trust when the school board awarded Superintendent \uc2 Juan Cabrera\uc2  a $45,499 pay raise.\par \par \uc2 Cabrera has done a good job as superintendent, helping to rebuild a district shattered by cheating and corruption scandals. The school board also has steered a steady course. Those changes led voters in November to pass a record $669 million bond issue to overhaul EPISD infrastructure.\par \par \uc2 But the school board's recent decision to give Cabrera a 15 percent raise has prompted well-deserved backlash from teachers and others who also have played a key role in rebuilding the district.\par \par \uc2 The huge raise, boosting Cabrera's base pay to almost $350,000 a year, came with no advance public notice. That's pretty typical of how Texas school districts have long operated, but EPISD is not a typical district.\par \par \uc2 In trying to recover from the district's recent history, the current EPISD board and administration have pursued a higher level of transparency than is typical in school systems. That has been a welcome change.\par \par \uc2 That higher level of transparency was needed in the decision to give Cabrera a huge raise. The board should have notified the public that it was considering such a raise before approving it. That would have allowed for public debate, which would have been uncomfortable but helpful.\par \par \uc2 Instead, the board reverted to traditional practice. They evaluated the superintendent in closed session, then came back into public session to approve his large pay raise. The public had no inkling that such a raise was under consideration, so had no input.\par \par \uc2 That approach may be justifiable in most districts but certainly not in a district slowly rebuilding trust with employees and the public.\par \par \uc2 The reaction from teacher groups was fierce and predictable. Symbolically, the size of Cabrera's raise was about the same as a salary for a first-year teacher. EPISD teachers and staff receive lower pay than neighboring districts.\par \par \uc2 "We are always given the story that there is never enough money," Norma De La Rosa, president of the El Paso Teachers Association, said the day after the raise was granted. "And to hear last night that they gave him a 15 percent pay raise \u8212\'20\'14 my question is, where did they find that money and 15 percent and can't find money for the teachers in the classroom, custodians and everyone else who works in the district and pay them a livable wage."\par \par \uc2 Cabrera, who was hired in 2013, and the school board members, who took office in 2015, deserve much credit for the work they've done to refocus EPISD on educating children.\par \par \uc2 But the work of rebuilding trust with a community betrayed by previous leadership is ongoing and challenging. EPISD leaders must be aware constantly that business as usual doesn't cut it.\par \par \uc2 The process used to give the superintendent a sizable raise fell short of what this community needs and deserves. EPISD leaders must do better going forward.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 The Dallas Morning News. Jan. 23, 2017.\par \par \uc2 So what's next?\par \par \uc2 The recent massive Women's Marches across the country (and beyond) brought together supporters of diverse political agendas: Women's reproductive rights. Climate change. Public education. Immigration. Voting and human rights. And that's just for starters. Added together, it has been called the largest demonstration in American history.\par \par \uc2 In a nation that seems perpetually divided, getting more than a million people to rally in dozens of cities is no small feat. Even the tea party movement, which had its own Taxpayer March on Washington in 2009 and has been influential ever since, paled in comparison.\par \par \uc2 How the passion from the Women's Marches is channeled will determine whether the marchers' voices will have a lasting impact or become a historical footnote to the early days of the Trump administration. It's one thing to take issue with the incoming president's style and policies; focusing that passion into sustained political and social engagement is a quite another. So kudos to freshman state Rep. Victoria Neave, D-Dallas, who helped organize the local march and is trying to channel that energy to improve public education and promote equal pay for women in Texas, among other things.\par \par \uc2 Count us among those who believe that peaceful constructive protests followed up with serious political and community involvement make for a better America. The million-plus people who gathered last weekend showed how protests can be family events and a lesson in how democracy should work.\par \par \uc2 Already, event organizers have unveiled a "10 Actions for the first 100 Days" campaign to keep those who supported the march focused on activism, with a new project every 10 days. For the first action, they've asked participants to write postcards to lawmakers explaining issues that matter most to them, such as health care, LGBTQ rights and immigration. Downloadable versions of the postcards are available online, at womensmarch.com/100.\par \par \uc2 Want to move beyond writing lawmakers? (Psst ... They take phone calls, too.) There are a host of other ways to influence the political process. Start by making sure you're registered to vote \u8212\'20\'14 and helping register others, as well. If that seems like small potatoes, start preparing to run for office yourself.\par \par \uc2 And it doesn't all have to be political. Volunteer, to share your passion with those closest to you. It could be as simple as volunteering at your neighborhood school, donating clothes to the nearest shelter, or assisting high school students in filling out financial aid forms. The bottom line is to be an engaged citizen, to show what can be accomplished when you get off the sidelines. And to keep it up.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 Houston Chronicle. Jan. 24, 2017.\par \par \uc2 We don't know when it'll happen, but sometime soon new recruits to Houston are going to quit being surprised by its diversity, its culture, its food and the startling lack of hitching posts in front of its buildings.\par \par \uc2 Consider recent transplant Dr. Tom McGillivray, who accepted a job in the Texas Medical Center after seeing Houston for himself. MacGillivray, a recruit from Harvard, told reporter Mike Hixenbaugh that he was pleasantly surprised by the city's cosmopolitan character.\par \par \uc2 Houstonians have built a remarkable place, and it's time once and for all to let everyone know it.\par \par \uc2 Case in point: In the past decade, Houston's restaurants secured a spot on every important culinary list. Our city's next target should be the arts.\par \par \uc2 We have three home-grown arts directors managing capital investments that are poised to change the visual arts scene as we know it: Allison Weaver of the Moody Center for the Arts at \uc2 Rice University\uc2 , Rebecca Rabinow of the Menil Collection, and Gary Tinterow of the \uc2 Museum of Fine Arts Houston\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The new Moody Center will nurture cross-disciplinary collaboration between the arts, sciences and humanities. The Menil Drawing Institute, opening the first weekend in October, is positioned to become a leading international venue for thinking about the role of drawing \u8212\'20\'14 the initial entry point of visual art creativity for most young people \u8212\'20\'14 in contemporary culture.\par \par \uc2 The MFAH has three construction projects at various stages of development: a new home for the Glassell School of Art on Montrose, now under construction; the Nancy and Rich Kinder Building for 20th- and 21st-century art, planned on the parking lot now on Bissonnet; and the Sarah Campbell Blaffer Foundation Center for Conservation, a state-of-the-art conservation center to be built on the roof of an existing parking garage on Bissonnet and Main.\par \par \uc2 Houston's progress in the arts rests on many pillars, including a relatively affordable cost of living for contemporary artists, a diverse international population and a variety of nonprofits engaged in a wide range of art-related activities. Private funding \u8212\'20\'14 from large corporate and foundation gifts, to attendance fees \u8212\'20\'14 has sustained steady growth in our arts community. And then there is the continuing public support out of earmarked taxes on hotels.\par \par \uc2 In order to fully capitalize on these public and private investments and elevate Houston as an arts destination, the boards and professional staff of arts organizations \u8212\'20\'14 large and small \u8212\'20\'14 and city and county officials should put their heads together and devise a plan to create greater public awareness of all that is going on in this city in the visual and performing arts.\par \par \uc2 The MFAH's Tinterow is right when he observed that increased collaboration "will lift all boats."\par \par \uc2 The Super Bowl host committee and various organizations supporting it have shown all that can be achieved when city and county leadership is focused and coordinated. After this national event, Houston First, the Greater Houston Convention and Business Bureau and others that have contributed to the Super Bowl effort should apply lessons learned to highlighting our artistic and cultural offerings.\par \par \uc2 To understand the magnitude of the city's potential as an arts destination, consider a fact that Tinterow shared with the editorial board. The MFAH hosted more visitors to its recent Degas exhibit than could fit in NRG stadium at the Super Bowl. Who were those Degas visitors? 85 percent are from Houston and its suburbs, according to Tinterow.\par \par \uc2 The challenges to greater destination tourism are well-known, but manageable. Houston has always been a city for business travelers, not for the leisure traveler. Hospitality providers ranging from hotels to airlines need to support a range of offerings at prices attractive to leisure travelers.\par \par \uc2 For decades Houstonians have invested their time and treasure to build a competitive, world-class arts scene. It is now time to reap the benefits by showing it off.\par \par \uc2 It is great for newcomers to be pleasantly surprised. It will even better if newcomers come to Houston, and our city meets their high expectations.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 Fort Worth Star-Telegram. Jan. 26, 2017.\par \par \uc2 Is your neighbor's tall grass or noisy dog driving you bonkers?\par \par \uc2 There's now a mobile app for Arlington residents, Ask Arlington, that can help with that. Euless and Fort Worth have similar apps.\par \par \uc2 The app is part of Arlington's five-year plan to lift the burden from the city's Action Center hotline.\par \par \uc2 Simple complaints, like reporting a neighbor's junked vehicle, can be dealt with electronically and without long phone hold times.\par \par \uc2 People can also send the city a photo of the violation.\par \par \uc2 Other cities have online reporting forms, and you can always call in the complaint, but distractions can happen between the time you are parking your car and when you sit down at the computer. A mobile app is easier.\par \par \uc2 Code enforcement helps property values and makes neighborhoods look better. No one likes to be next door to a house with a lawn fit for a haunted house.\par \par \uc2 This app can help keep Arlington attractive. Other cities should take note.\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020170131ed1v00f1x\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

FOLEY \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 706 \uc2 words\par \uc2 25 October 2016\par 14:52\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2016.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) \u8212\'20\'14 A Hispanic woman says her white co-workers at an Iowa claims office used images of \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  to racially harass her for months after they learned she was angered by his description of Mexican immigrants as rapists, according to a civil rights lawsuit she filed against her company.\par \par \uc2 Alexandra Avila's co-workers at \uc2 Sedgwick Claims Management Services\uc2  \u8212\'20\'14 where they administered benefits for \uc2 Wal-Mart\uc2  employees \u8212\'20\'14 began calling her an "\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 " even though she's a natural-born U.S. citizen, according to the lawsuit filed Monday in Iowa district court. The suit claims her former co-workers placed a picture of an angry-looking Trump as Avila's computer's screensaver, signed her up to volunteer for his campaign and sent her racist memes, including one that read: "How's \uc2 Mr. Donald Trump\uc2  going to deport all these illegals? Juan by Juan."\par \par \uc2 The Republican presidential candidate's promise to build a border wall to keep out Mexican immigrants has for months contributed to racial tensions nationwide. "Build a wall" chants have been used by high school students to taunt Latino opponents at sporting events in multiple states, including Iowa, Wisconsin and Indiana. At \uc2 Kent State University\uc2 , Latinos marching in the Homecoming parade this month said they were taunted with the same chant.\par \par \uc2 Avila, a 32-year-old mother of one who worked at Sedgwick for three years, claims she faced similar heckling at her white-collar workplace in Coralville, Iowa, from the beginning of Trump's campaign in June 2015 until after she was fired five months later.\par \par \uc2 "It's been a weird political season where one candidate is taking public stances on things that, if the same words were said in the workplace, might constitute violations of our civil rights laws," said Avila's attorney, Paige Fiedler. "His candidacy has emboldened some people to feel like that doesn't violate social norms anymore."\par \par \uc2 Lesley Gudehus, spokeswoman for Memphis, Tennessee-based Sedgwick, declined comment on the lawsuit.\par \par \uc2 Avila, born in California to Mexican parents, told colleagues she was upset with Trump's 2015 campaign launch when he said of Mexican immigrants: "They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists."\par \par \uc2 Soon after, the lawsuit claims, colleagues removed the photo Avila had of her young daughter as her computer screensaver and replaced it with a picture of Trump yelling and pointing his finger. When Avila removed the photo, they kept switching it back to Trump, the suit alleges.\par \par \uc2 An email arrived from the Trump campaign last fall thanking her for the support and asking how she wanted to help, according to the suit. Avila also claims her colleagues sent offensive memes, including one showing a brown-skinned man that read: "Found Jesus \u8212\'20\'14 he stabbed me twice."\par \par \uc2 When her department was voting on a potluck menu, one co-worker said Avila was ineligible because she was an "\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 ," drawing laughter from Avila's boss, the lawsuit claims. Avila contends that after she complained about the harassment, the company accused her of falsifying timecards by claiming she worked minutes more time than she actually did.\par \par \uc2 Avila was fired last November and escorted out, with Sedgwick saying it would send her personal property later. When her belongings arrived from \uc2 FedEx\uc2 , Avila says they contained a handwritten note that called her "La Trumpa" and added: "Illegal immigrants can't vote or work. Good luck finding a job."\par \par \uc2 "Getting that box in the mail was a horrific experience," Fiedler says.\par \par \uc2 After her firing, a co-worker sent her an invitation to a Trump rally on \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , the lawsuit claims.\par \par \uc2 The lawsuit, which names Sedgwick and two supervisors, alleges Avila suffered discrimination based on national origin and that the company failed to pay wages she earned.\par \par \uc2 This undated photo provided by attorney Paige Fiedler shows Alexandra Avila, of Columbus Junction, Iowa. Avila has filed a lawsuit that alleges her co-workers at the Coralville, Iowa office of Sedgwick Claims Management Services repeatedly used the image of Donald Trump to harass her after she objected to Trump's comments about Mexican immigrants.
