The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) - Gov. Nikki Haley signed changes into law on Monday that grant more power to police to check whether people are illegal immigrants, a move expected to face legal challenges after similar measures met with lawsuits in other states.\par \par \uc2 The changes in law require police in South Carolina to call federal immigration officials if someone is suspected of being in the country illegally. And it creates a new police force to enforce a law that would also make it a felony to make fake photographic identification for illegal immigrants. People convicted of that felony could face $25,000 fines and five years in prison.\par \par \uc2 The changes tighten what already were some of the nation's toughest measures to curb illegal immigrants living and working here.\par \par \uc2 Haley, the Bamberg-born daughter of immigrants from India, emphasized her background as she spoke to supporters and opponents at the bill signing.\par \par \uc2 "As the daughter of immigrants, I want to make everyone aware that this bill has a tolerance to it. ... This is not a bill that pushes one group away for another group. This is a bill that enforces laws," she said.\par \par \uc2 Legal immigrants "come here, they put in their time, they pay the price and they get here the right way," Haley said. "What we're saying is this state can no longer afford to support people that don't come here the right way and we are now going to do something about it."\par \par \uc2 Under the changes, police can ask about immigration status after an arrest or traffic stop and can't hold anyone solely on the suspicion that they're an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . It requires officers to call federal immigration officials if they suspect someone is in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 Haley brushed aside rumblings that the American Civil Liberties Union plans to sue over the law before it takes effect in January. She said she has "a long list of lawsuits that continue to come my way and the more they send lawsuits (it) just reminds me the more I'm doing my job for the state of South Carolina."\par \par \uc2 State ACLU Director Victoria Middleton said the law invites racial profiling. "And it basically will subject anyone who looks or sounds foreign to discrimination," Middleton said.\par \par \uc2 The American Civil Liberties Union is suing to block similar laws in Arizona, Utah, Indiana, and Georgia. It is also planning to sue in Alabama.\par \par \uc2 When the GOP -dominated House gave the legislation final approval last week, House Speaker Bobby Harrell said the state was stepping into a void because the federal government "refuses to effectively support our law enforcement officers by enforcing immigration laws."\par \par \uc2 South Carolina's illegal immigration law was considered one of the nation's toughest measures when it was first passed in 2008. But legislators have been criticized for failing to put money into enforcing the law. The spending plan on Haley's desk for vetoes now includes $1.3 million toward for the law enforcement unit.\par \par \uc2 Despite the costs, Haley said the state will save money because illegal immigrants will use fewer services.\par \par \uc2 Haley said South Carolina is a tolerant state. But "we follow laws in South Carolina and we don't turn our backs on anything that is illegal."\par \par \uc2 Bill co-sponsor Larry Grooms called illegal immigration a threat to the nation's liberty and freedom that must be eradicated. "They cling together in illegal communities and bring with them drugs, prostitution, violent crime and gang activity," Grooms said in remarks to brought heckles from bill opponents\par \par \uc2 Columbia activist Kevin Gray said "that's just patently racist."\par \par \uc2 Julie Smithwick-Leone of West Columbia said Grooms' remarks showed ignorance "that shows how far removed these legislators are from the population and they really don't know who the population is what all they are giving and bringing to our state."\par \par \uc2 Brett Bursey of the South Carolina Progressive Network opposed the legislation and wondered who would replace \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  workers now doing work in agriculture. "Who's going to pick our tomatoes, our watermelons and our cucumbers?" Bursey asked\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Follow Jim Davenport on Twitter at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://twitter.com/jimdavenport--ap"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://twitter.com/jimdavenport--ap}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 5\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110627e76r002xq\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) - Large crowds carrying candles and wearing white marched quietly Saturday in a demonstration organized by churches and other faith-based groups against Alabama's tough new law cracking down on illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 The protest began with a mass prayer for kindness and mercy in a shady park, where people waited in line to sign a petition against the law.\par \par \uc2 The crowd was a mix mostly of whites and Hispanics. Organizers gave instructions in both English and Spanish.\par \par \uc2 "It's a terrible law and needs to be revoked," said Jo Anne Gaede, of Mountain Brook. "They are people just like me."\par \par \uc2 Lee Moradi, who is from Iran originally but is now a U.S. citizen, called the law "mean."\par \par \uc2 "I'm not for illegal immigration, but this law is ridiculous," Moradi said.\par \par \uc2 Organizers said the law is a mean-spirited attempt to run an entire group of people out of a state that is still trying to recover from the damage of decades of race-based segregation laws.\par \par \uc2 Prospective marchers signed up on a \uc2 Facebook\uc2  page set up for the demonstration, and the crowd appeared to range from the hundreds to low thousands.\par \par \uc2 Both supporters and opponents of the law describe it as the nation's toughest state crackdown on illegal immigration. Protest leaders -- many of whom are from Christian churches -- said the law violates biblical principles and could criminalize basic ministry activities such as providing food, transportation or housing assistance to the needy if the recipient is in the United States illegally.\par \par \uc2 "It is an imperative of my faith to welcome the stranger," said organizer Angie Wright, pastor of Beloved Community United Church of Christ in Birmingham.\par \par \uc2 The march -- the first major demonstration planned since Gov. Robert Bentley signed the law earlier this month -- was held not far from where black demonstrators marched through downtown Birmingham protesting legalized racial segregation in the 1960s.\par \par \uc2 The law takes effect Sept. 1 and makes it a crime to knowingly hire illegal immigrants, rent them places to live or give them rides. It requires schools to determine the immigration status of their students and report it to the state, although children in the country illegally would not be refused enrollment.\par \par \uc2 The governor's office had no immediate comment on the protest. Bentley, a Republican and Southern Baptist church deacon, defended the law when he signed it.\par \par \uc2 "We have a real problem with illegal immigration in this country," he said. "I campaigned for the toughest immigration laws, and I'm proud of the Legislature for working tirelessly to create the strongest immigration bill in the country."\par \par \uc2 Leaders of the United Methodist Church, the Episcopal Church, the Lutheran Church and the Roman Catholic Church all have criticized the law. The president of Alabama's largest denomination, the Alabama Southern Baptist Convention, said he believes all laws should be obeyed but worries about sections of the law that could make it illegal to help people.\par \par \uc2 While opponents of the law describe it as unconstitutional and plan to sue to block it, no suit has been filed. Opponents have organized a petition effort against the act, but it was unclear what impact the drive might have, if any.\par \par \uc2 The head of Greater Birmingham Ministries, an ecumenical group that provides assistance to the poor, said he feared the law will make it easier for some to take advantage of illegal immigrants because it states that any contract with an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  is void.\par \par \uc2 "An employer can hire an undocumented worker for a week, and then refuse to pay him; the worker will have no recourse," the Rev. Scott Douglas, executive director of the ministry organization, said in a statement.\par \par \uc2 New figures from the Census showed Alabama's Hispanic population increased 145 percent in the last decade to about 185,600 total people.

COOPER   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 876 \uc2 words\par \uc2 25 June 2011\par 14:54\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2011.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SALEM, Ore. (AP) - When Oregon voters elected a tied House, Republicans got shared control of the chamber and new clout they hadn't enjoyed in years.\par \par \uc2 With Democrats controlling the Senate and the governor's office, the GOP still had a distinct disadvantage and only enough power to block legislation it didn't like. But Republican leaders have used their small opening as both a roadblock and a bargaining chip, frustrating Democrats and putting a clear Republican imprint on public policy in Oregon.\par \par \uc2 They've expanded both online and traditional charter schools, and blocked plenty of Democratic bills, like one that would have allowed some illegal immigrants to pay in-state tuition at public universities and another that would have banned the chemical bisphenol-A from baby bottles and children's sippy cups.\par \par \uc2 "The people of Oregon sent us here to make a change for them," said Rep. Kevin Cameron of Salem, the Republican leader. "Some people who got sent back here maybe didn't get that message."\par \par \uc2 To be sure, Democrats still wield the most power in Salem, and they've used it to advance many of their priorities. But a far cry from just two years ago, when they had supermajorities in the House and Senate, control of the governor's office and the power to do just about whatever they wanted on their own. They raised taxes on businesses and the wealthy, funded new highway projects and extended health coverage to thousands of children.\par \par \uc2 That all changed in November when, following a national trend, Oregon voters elected more Republicans to office. For the first time in state history, there were 30 Republicans and 30 Democrats in the state House.\par \par \uc2 The parties agreed to share power equally. Committee co-chairmen from each party would have to approve before a bill could advance to a vote of the full House. The structure gave Republican leaders and committee chairs a powerful bargaining chip they've deployed with precision.\par \par \uc2 They used their new clout most publicly on a high-profile package of education bills that passed last week, refusing for weeks to allow votes on Democratic priorities until they were comfortable there were enough votes to pass the GOP's school choice initiatives.\par \par \uc2 "Having a split in the House means that we're at the table at every negotiation, because whatever people are designing has to get through the House," said Rep. Matt Wingard, a Wilsonville Republican who championed the school-choice bills that ultimately made it to the governor's desk. "That means people have to consider the things that we're saying, address our concerns. One chair different in this body and they wouldn't."\par \par \uc2 Democratic Gov. John Kitzhaber has not yet taken action on the education bills but he's said he will sign them.\par \par \uc2 Earlier this year, Republicans successfully demanded that nearly a half-billion dollars of projected revenue be left unspent in the next two-year budget. They say it would help reduce the need for cuts if the economy tanks again, frustrating Democrats who think some of the money could be used to protect services right now.\par \par \uc2 They also won a battle with Democrats over a bill that provided $93 million in business tax breaks. They say they're proud that the budget was balanced without raising taxes and that, in most cases, there were only minimal increases in the fees that government agencies can charge.\par \par \uc2 Even stronger than their ability to push an agenda, though, has been Republicans' ability -- and their willingness -- to stand in the way of Democrats. On \uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2  tuition, on banning bisphenol-A, on slowing home foreclosures, Democrats have watched their bills pass the Senate and die unceremoniously in a House committee because they couldn't get the needed sign-off from a GOP committee co-chair.\par \par \uc2 Democrats have their own successes, some of them huge -- new legislative districts that favor their candidates; job creation bills that give businesses loans instead of tax credits; $40 million for non-highway transportation and at least $25 million in additional funding for schools.\par \par \uc2 And they've blocked their share of Republican priorities. The GOP got nowhere with ambitious proposals to scale back retirement and health care benefits for state workers, decentralize land use planning and repeal the business tax hikes from 2009's Measure 67.\par \par \uc2 "I think they didn't achieve a lot of their goals, unless you count among their goals killing good bills," said Rep. Dave Hunt of Gladstone, the Democratic leader. "They did have a pretty good deal of success killing good bills."\par \par \uc2 Democratic leaders say Republicans have been less-than-ideal negotiating partners, walking away from agreement and making side deals. But they say they've succeeded at protecting the most important services for the most vulnerable citizens despite a tough budget and the tied House.\par \par \uc2 "This has been a hard session for everybody," said Rep. Peter Buckley, the chief Democratic budget negotiator in the House. "I think we feel good about the things we did get accomplished. I think we're very fatigued by the process."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Follow Jonathan J.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) - Churches and faith-based groups planned to march against Alabama's new law targeting illegal immigrants Saturday, calling it a mean-spirited attempt to run an entire group of people out of a state that is still trying to recover from the damage of decades of race-based segregation laws.\par \par \uc2 More than 1,400 people said they planned to attend on a \uc2 Facebook\uc2  page set up for the demonstration, and planners said they expected many more based on calls and messages they've gotten from around the state.\par \par \uc2 Both supporters and opponents of the law describe it as the nation's toughest state crackdown on illegal immigration. Protest leaders -- many of whom were from Christian churches -- said the law violates biblical principles and could criminalize basic ministry activities like providing food, transportation or housing assistance to the needy if the recipient is in the United States illegally.\par \par \uc2 "It is an imperative of my faith to welcome the stranger," said organizer Angie Wright, pastor of Beloved Community United Church of Christ in Birmingham.\par \par \uc2 The march -- the first major demonstration planned since Gov. Robert Bentley signed the law earlier this month -- was held not far from where black demonstrators marched through downtown Birmingham protesting legalized racial segregation in the 1960s.\par \par \uc2 The law takes effect Sept. 1 and makes it a crime to knowingly hire illegal immigrants, rent them places to live or give them rides. It requires schools to determine the immigration status of their students and report it to the state, although children in the country illegally would not be refused enrollment.\par \par \uc2 The governor's office had no immediate comment on the protest. Bentley, a Republican and Southern Baptist church deacon, defended the law when he signed it.\par \par \uc2 "We have a real problem with illegal immigration in this country," he said. "I campaigned for the toughest immigration laws, and I'm proud of the Legislature for working tirelessly to create the strongest immigration bill in the country."\par \par \uc2 Leaders of the United Methodist Church, the Episcopal Church, the Lutheran Church and the Roman Catholic Church all have criticized the law. The president of Alabama's largest denomination, the Alabama Southern Baptist Convention, said he believes all laws should be obeyed but worries about sections of the law that could make it illegal to help people.\par \par \uc2 While opponents of the law describe it as unconstitutional and plan to sue to block it, no suit has been filed. Opponents have organized a petition effort against the act, but it was unclear what impact the drive might have, if any.\par \par \uc2 The head of Greater Birmingham Ministries, an ecumenical group that provides assistance to the poor, said he feared the law will make it easier for some to take advantage of illegal immigrants because it states that any contract with an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  is void.\par \par \uc2 "An employer can hire an undocumented worker for a week, and then refuse to pay him; the worker will have no recourse," the Rev. Scott Douglas, executive director of the ministry organization, said in a statement.\par \par \uc2 New figures from the Census showed Alabama's Hispanic population increased 145 percent in the last decade to about 185,600 total people. Hispanics now make up nearly 4 percent of the state's population.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110625e76p003vg\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

"Don't come back here again."\par \par \uc2 Vargas confronted his grandfather, who acknowledged he purchased the green card and other fake documents.\par \par \uc2 Salinas, 53, a former office assistant, said that her son was ready for the consequences of his action -- a possiblity of deportation -- and has already obtained a Philippine passport.\par \par \uc2 He has been wanting to see his family in the Philippines and has promised his younger sister, whose nursing education he is financing, that he would come home for her graduation next year, she said.\par \par \uc2 He also has a 14-year-old brother who he has only seen via the Internet.\par \par \uc2 "We are excited to see him," Salinas added. "I just hope he can come home with his documents in order."\par \par \uc2 When she sent him off to America, Salinas said she promised she would follow him and had applied several times for a U.S. visa but was denied.\par \par \uc2 She said that she felt her son resented her unfulfilled promise and for a time after he went to college, he seldom called or wrote letters. But she said they reconnected after he joined The Washington Post.\par \par \uc2 Salinas, who separated from Vargas' father when the boy was 3, said she could not afford to send her son to school in the Philippines. She said she sent him to his grandparents in the U.S. because like any mother, she wanted a good future for him.\par \par \uc2 "In the beginning, there were times I would think I wish I did not send him there, I wish we could be together especially during special occasions," she said. "But I saw what he was doing ... I saw that he was achieving his dreams, getting the things which he could not get here."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110624e76o000fs\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc6}{\*\bkmkend toc6}\b \uc2 A sampling of editorials from Texas newspapers\b0\par\par\uc2 By The Associated Press   \par \uc2 2,687 \uc2 words\par \uc2 23 June 2011\par 17:11\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2011.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Austin American-Statesman, June 21\par \par \uc2 Latest session add-ons don't deserve 2nd chance\par \par \uc2 Perhaps you've noticed that the first (and we hope only) special session of the 82nd Texas Legislature is dragging on. The session has not been a high point in American democracy. It hit a particularly low point Monday when too few House members showed up to conduct business.\par \par \uc2 We know the pay is only $600 a month, plus expenses, but we expect our elected lawmakers to show up to make law when they're supposed to.\par \par \uc2 Two other things happened Monday that deserve disapproving notice from Texans. One involves something Gov. Rick Perry added to the special session agenda (which he controls).\par \par \uc2 The other involves something he apparently is trying to slide into the mix without officially adding it to the agenda.\par \par \uc2 The second one involves a renewed effort to bar you from seeing how tax dollars are spent to protect the governor. This renews an effort that failed during the regular session. The Department of Public Safety, citing security concerns, wants to exempt from public disclosure laws the money it spends on security efforts for Perry and his wife, Anita, when they travel.\par \par \uc2 On Monday, Sen. Robert Duncan, R-Lubbock, confirmed to the Houston Chronicle that the topic is being considered by the House-Senate conference committee -- of which Duncan is a member -- working on what is primarily a school finance bill. Ken Armbrister, Perry's legislative liaison, confirmed Tuesday that the governor pushed for consideration of the topic. If the governor deems the topic important, he should just add it to the special session agenda.\par \par \uc2 Two lower courts have ruled in favor of a lawsuit filed by the Austin American-Statesman, San Antonio Express-News and Houston Chronicle, all of which challenged a DPS decision against releasing details of how it spends security money. The agency cited security concerns. DPS now releases only total figures concerning gubernatorial security. More detailed records have been released in the past.\par \par \uc2 The issue is pending at the Texas Supreme Court. The newspapers and others argue that release of the records would not cause a security problem because it would come long after the trips were made.\par \par \uc2 "There is nothing in these reimbursement vouchers that if released, would put the governor or any elected official at risk. They are submitted up to 30 days after the fact," said the Texas Association of Broadcasters' Michael Schneider.\par \par \uc2 The effort to rekindle this topic deserves to die.\par \par \uc2 So does an effort Perry rekindled Monday by adding the so-called anti-groping measure to the special session agenda. At issue is whether Transportation Security Administration workers go too far with their airport pat-downs.\par \par \uc2 Perry said Monday that he wants legislation "relating to the prosecution and punishment for the offense of official oppression on those seeking access to public buildings and transportation."\par \par \uc2 House Bill 41 by Rep. David Simpson, R-Longview, would make it an offense for a federal worker to "intentionally, knowingly or recklessly" touch "the anus, sexual organ, buttocks or breast of the other person, including touching through clothing." The measure has won House committee approval and is awaiting action on the House floor, where it is scheduled for Friday debate.\par \par \uc2 Nobody can be happy with the hassles associated with air travel, but they remain necessary, as the TSA noted in a statement Monday responding to Perry's effort.\par \par \uc2 "Americans rely on TSA to put in place effective procedures to resolve security threats and screen passengers who decline to be screened by technology," the agency said. "Aviation security agencies worldwide have relied on pat downs since long before TSA was created, and we have adjusted our pat-down procedures based on what we have learned from intelligence and the tactics used by our adversaries."\par \par \uc2 During the regular session, TSA said air travel in Texas could be disrupted if agency employees were barred from using security procedures now in use.\par \par \uc2 When the bill died in the regular session, we thought it was dead for the year. And so did Perry, who was confronted about it Saturday in New Orleans while he was signing copies of his book at the Republican Leadership Conference. Wesley Strackbein, who is among those deeply concerned about the TSA procedures, asked Perry if he would allow lawmakers to consider the topic in the special session. (See the video.)\par \par \uc2 "They're not going to have it," Perry replied. "They don't have the votes on either side. That's what I told them. I said, `Bring me a multitude of votes,' well not a multitude but ... and they never had those votes."\par \par \uc2 Strackbein then told Perry there were 112 co-sponsors for the bill in the House, more than enough to get it passed.\par \par \uc2 "In view of that, would you consider bringing it up?" he asked the governor.\par \par \uc2 "Probably not. There is not enough time left in the session," Perry said.\par \par \uc2 With that, the two shook hands, smiled for a photo and moved on to other things.\par \par \uc2 The Legislature should do likewise with Perry's efforts to keep his security records from public scrutiny and put Texas on an unnecessary collision course with the feds over airport security.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 The Dallas Morning News, June 22\par \par \uc2 Yes to nuclear power, but only if safety comes first\par \par \uc2 When housing and banking regulators weren't looking, Wall Street ran wild with deals that tossed the nation's economy into a tailspin.\par \par \uc2 When energy regulators got too cozy with the drilling industry, oil ended up spewing through the Gulf of Mexico from the explosion of the BP Deepwater Horizon rig.\par \par \uc2 Now troubling signs have emerged that this pattern could be repeating itself, this time in the nuclear power industry.\par \par \uc2 According to an extensive Associated Press investigation, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is routinely keeping aging reactors within safety standards by weakening or ignoring the rules. That's the equivalent of a teacher dropping grade requirements to keep students from flunking or a doctor ignoring troubling test results and declaring a patient healthy.\par \par \uc2 This alarming, reckless and reprehensible behavior by the NRC places expediency above nuclear safety, the commission's most important responsibility. In the interest of keeping kilowatts cranking, regulators are pursuing this unwise path of least resistance.\par \par \uc2 The AP investigation found that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has twice weakened the safety standard for acceptable radiation damage to reactor vessels, a critical gauge that helps predict when parts might become dangerously brittle and prone to failure.\par \par \uc2 Many of the East Coast plants have violated or come close to violating the standard but received a reprieve when the commission chose to adopt a looser standard. (The reactors in question are older ones, which aren't located in North Texas. In fact, Comanche Peak, near Glen Rose, is one of the nation's youngest facilities.)\par \par \uc2 Confronted by this investigation, the commission insists that safety isn't being compromised. Even if no immediate danger exists, the downward inspection spiral is a near-certain path to an accident. In addition to the threats to communities near the facilities, the commission's lax attitude could undermine credibility and development of additional nuclear energy.\par \par \uc2 The nation needs more nuclear power plants. Nuclear energy is a cleaner source than coal to produce electricity and is more reliable than wind and solar. Until recently, more Americans, including many environmental groups, had begun to look favorably on it.\par \par \uc2 But after Japan's nuclear disaster, public opinion in the U.S. is at a shaky juncture. Unless regulators hold the power industry to the highest safety standards and avoid sleight-of-hand oversight, Americans again -- and with good reason -- will turn against nuclear energy. After the Three Mile Island accident, nuclear plant construction in this country ground to a halt for about three decades, and our nation continues to pay the price for its unhealthy dependence on dirtier energy sources.\par \par \uc2 The U.S. needs nuclear energy, but it also needs regulators who do their job and put safety first.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 San Antonio Express-News, June 23\par \par \uc2 Public deserves access to Perry travel records\par \par \uc2 Reasonable people can disagree about whether Gov. Rick Perry's ambitious travel agenda benefits Texas, but records detailing tax dollars spent while he is on the road should be public.\par \par \uc2 Yet Perry has renewed his efforts to hide from public view the Department of Public Safety security expenses required to accommodate his travel.\par \par \uc2 The Express-News reported this week that Perry is asking lawmakers to add a provision keeping those records secret to a school finance bill that is working its way through the ongoing special session.\par \par \uc2 Even members of Perry's own political party have expressed doubts about the wisdom of indulging his penchant for secrecy.\par \par \uc2 Perry's request comes after two measures that would have hidden public expenditures on his security detail failed to pass in the regular legislative session, the Express-News noted.\par \par \uc2 Additionally, the Express-News and the Houston Chronicle won lower court rulings requiring the release of DPS vouchers related to Perry's travels, which include 23 foreign trips since he became governor, but the DPS has appealed the rulings to the Texas Supreme Court.\par \par \uc2 DPS officials claim releasing the information about Perry's patterns of travel and the number of officers on his security detail would be a security risk, but that excuse doesn't hold water.\par \par \uc2 As newspaper lawyers have noted, records are being sought long after trips are taken.\par \par \uc2 The specifics of the security team's expenses clearly are public record and would not give any advance notice about what Perry will do or where he will be next.\par \par \uc2 The state has released lump sum expenses -- the security costs for 23 foreign trips over seven years were about $1 million -- but declines to release vouchers that reveal details.\par \par \uc2 As newspaper lawyer Bill Christian told the Express-News, details such as expenditures in 2005 for a golf cart and scuba diving equipment "would be lost forever" if Perry gets his way. The newspapers filed suit in 2007 after the state stopped releasing such details.\par \par \uc2 Hiding this information long after the trips does nothing but give Perry political cover. Texans have a right to know how their tax dollars are being spent.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Amarillo Globe-News, June 21\par \par \uc2 Perry's texting-driving veto troubling\par \par \uc2 Gov. Rick Perry has issued what might be the most controversial veto of this legislative session.\par \par \uc2 And to be candid, the veto is difficult to defend.\par \par \uc2 Perry sent Texas House Bill 242, which would have banned texting while driving, to the dust bin over the weekend. "Texting while driving is reckless and irresponsible," Perry said in a statement. True enough.\par \par \uc2 "I support measures that make our roads safer for everyone," he continued, "but House Bill 242 is a government effort to micromanage the behavior of adults."\par \par \uc2 Micromanage?\par \par \uc2 Is the state micromanaging adults' behavior by banning open containers of alcohol in a car? How about when it requires everyone in a vehicle to wear seat restraints? One might argue, for heaven's sake, that the state micromanages adults' driving behavior by setting speed limits on our roads and highways.\par \par \uc2 The law banning texting while driving is a public safety issue.\par \par \uc2 The governor is right to point out that the state already has laws against operating a motor vehicle recklessly. The argument dodges an important point -- which is that people often are cited for reckless driving after that behavior has caused potentially grievous bodily injury -- or worse -- to someone else.\par \par \uc2 Several Texas cities have enacted ordinances banning this behavior. Amarillo hasn't yet imposed a citywide ban, although it has approved an ordinance banning texting and cell phone use while driving through a school zone.\par \par \uc2 Perry's veto is troubling in that he seems to be setting a new set of standards for behavior that puts people at risk. Isn't the act of texting while driving as risky as, say, driving drunk?\par \par \uc2 Indeed, it's instructive that even fellow conservative Republicans, such as state Rep. Jim Landtroop of Plainview, disagree with the veto, who called HB 242 part of legislators' responsibility to "protect the public's safety."\par \par \uc2 It's also part of the governor's job description.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Fort Worth Star-Telegram, June 22\par \par \uc2 In-state tuition for illegal immigrants\par \par \uc2 Should states' tuition rules allow some illegal immigrants to pay the same rates as legal residents?\par \par \uc2 The U.S. Supreme Court recently allowed that practice -- followed in Texas and a growing smattering of other states -- to continue.\par \par \uc2 But debate over whether it should continue persists.\par \par \uc2 The justices turned down a petition to review a California Supreme Court ruling that the state's tuition break doesn't conflict with federal law because U.S. citizens as well as illegal immigrants can get the lower rates by meeting graduation requirements.\par \par \uc2 Texas had this discussion in 2001, when the Legislature passed and Gov. Rick Perry signed the current tuition law.\par \par \uc2 A half-dozen bills to reverse course got nowhere during this year's regular legislative session -- good news, considering some of the ill-advised damage lawmakers have done.\par \par \uc2 Texas offers a number of tuition discounts. But the one that causes the most consternation allows students to qualify for lower rates if they lived in the state three years until high school graduation and got a diploma or the equivalent, no matter where their parents live.\par \par \uc2 Students who qualify under this provision might have graduated but their families left the state. Or they might have been raised by grandparents in Texas while their divorced parents lived elsewhere. They might even have been boarding school graduates.\par \par \uc2 Students who otherwise qualify but aren't U.S. citizens or legal residents can get in-state rates after submitting an affidavit saying they'll apply to become legal residents as soon as they're eligible.\par \par \uc2 About 14,300 students filed those affidavits from summer 2008 through the 2008-09 school year, according to the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board. That amounted to less than 1 percent of the 1.4 million students enrolled in state colleges and universities. The number of legal residents who get lower tuition under this law wasn't available.\par \par \uc2 But letting even \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students qualify for resident rates is a defensible policy. It makes college more affordable to students who have demonstrated the commitment to finish high school and pursue higher education in order to improve their prospects for decent employment and a prosperous future. Those are positive, responsible behaviors that Texans should want to encourage for their overall benefit to the state.\par \par \uc2 It also assists students who face a conundrum not of their making: They were brought to the U.S. as children, consider it home and would legalize their status if only they could. But federal law currently doesn't let them.\par \par \uc2 It's undeniable there's a cost, at a time when the state is cutting higher ed funding. Nonresident tuition at the University of Texas, for instance, exceeds in-state by $10,878 per semester for a liberal arts major. At UT Arlington, a nonresident would pay $4,695 more per semester for a 15-hour load.\par \par \uc2 But of the students who filed affidavits, only 3,744 enrolled at four-year universities in 2008-09; more than 10,500 attended community, state and technical colleges, the Coordinating Board reported.\par \par \uc2 At Tarrant County College, in-county students pay $50 per semester hour; out-of-staters and nonresident aliens pay $165.\par \par \uc2 Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott in 2009 ruled that the state law doesn't violate the U.S. Constitution's equal protection guarantees. He called the rules "reasonable requirements that serve Texas' legitimate or substantial interest" in making sure only bona fide residents who get Texas diplomas can get in-state tuition.\par \par \uc2 Still, a suit challenging Texas' law is pending in a Houston court. Other cases are likely: USA Today reported that soon 13 states will allow illegal immigrants to qualify for in-state tuition, while five specifically bar it.\par \par \uc2 A Supreme Court ruling is only a matter of time.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110623e76n003np\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc7}{\*\bkmkend toc7}\b \uc2 Illegal immigrant\uc2  youth 'come out' in risky bid to ease rules for those brought to US as kids\b0\par\par\uc2 By KATE BRUMBACK   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 1,242 \uc2 words\par \uc2 23 June 2011\par 19:07\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2011.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ATLANTA (AP) - Eighteen-year-old Dulce Guerrero kept quiet about being an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  until earlier this year, when she became upset after a traffic stop that landed her mother in jail for two nights. The arrest came as Georgia lawmakers were crafting what would become one of the nation's toughest immigration crackdowns, and Guerrero feared her mother would be deported.\par \par \uc2 "I feel like that was my breaking point, when my mom was in jail," said Guerrero, who came to the U.S. from Mexico when she was 2. "I felt like, well, that's it, it can't get any worse than this. My mother has been to jail."\par \par \uc2 Guerrero first publicly announced her immigration status at a protest in March, and now she's organizing a rally under the tutelage of more experienced activists who are themselves only a few years older. The high-stakes movement of young illegal immigrants declaring that they're "undocumented and unafraid" got a boost this week when a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist revealed he's been living in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 Guerrero is the chief organizer of a rally set for Tuesday at the Georgia State Capitol for high school-age illegal immigrants to tell their stories. The recent high school graduate and others hope to draw attention to the plight of the hundreds of thousands of young people who were brought to the U.S. illegally by their parents.\par \par \uc2 Already around the country, efforts by young activists have ranged from rallies and letter-writing to sit-ins and civil disobedience, drawing inspiration from civil rights demonstrations decades ago, with the aim of forcing the federal government to reform rules for immigrants in their situation.\par \par \uc2 In one of the most high-profile declarations yet, former Washington Post reporter Jose Antonio Vargas used an ABC News interview and a \uc2 New York Times Magazine\uc2  article to announce Wednesday that he is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from the Philippines.\par \par \uc2 "It's very exciting," said 25-year-old Mohammad Abdollahi, a veteran protester who's helping Guerrero. Vargas' revelation "shows that we exist in all walks of life. Folks don't realize how American we are," he said.\par \par \uc2 Some in the community fear Vargas' admission that he used false documents to get a driver's license and a job could invite backlash, but it illustrates the difficult reality for illegal immigrants seeking to pursue their goals, Abdollahi said.\par \par \uc2 Those who come forward make themselves vulnerable, but it's no guarantee they'll have to leave the U.S. right away. Some have been deported despite broad support from their communities asking that they be allowed to stay. Others, like Georgia college student and cause celebre Jessica Colotl, have won at least temporary reprieves.\par \par \uc2 Mandeep Chahal, an honors student at the University of California, Davis, and her mother were granted a stay in their deportation proceedings Tuesday after Chahal, 20, campaigned on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  to avoid being sent back to India.\par \par \uc2 Proponents of stricter enforcement of immigration laws often concede that young people in this situation are among the most sympathetic cases but that legalizing them still raises problems.\par \par \uc2 "Our own American young adult college grads are in dire straits in the job market -- and particularly disproportionately Hispanic and black Americans -- so what the DREAM Act does is adds potentially a million, two million more people to compete legally in that job market," said Roy Beck, executive director of NumbersUSA, which pushes for tighter immigration control. "So, as compelling as the case of these DREAM students is, we have to acknowledge that legalizing them does actually victimize our own young adults."\par \par \uc2 Guerrero's been working to attract participants for next week's rally by telling friends how relieved she felt after speaking out. But she never tries to push people to reveal they're in the U.S. illegally unless they're ready and understand the potential consequences.\par \par \uc2 She's taking advice from Abdollahi and 22-year-old Georgina Perez, who have both helped organize other protests and share similar backgrounds. Abdollahi was brought to the U.S. from Iran when he was 3 and was raised in Michigan; Perez arrived with her mother from Mexico at age 2, living first in Los Angeles and then near Atlanta.\par \par \uc2 They offer Guerrero the perspective of activists willing to risk arrest -- and the threat of deportation -- for their beliefs. Abdollahi, who's been organizing protests since 2009, was held briefly with three others after they staged a sit-in at Arizona Sen. John McCain's office last year. Perez was arrested after she and six other young immigrants sat in a downtown Atlanta intersection and blocked traffic.\par \par \uc2 Deportation proceedings were begun against Abdollahi but haven't progressed past the initial stages, while immigration authorities took no action against Perez. The Obama administration hasn't promised not to deport young people in their situation, but Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano has made it clear that they are not a priority.\par \par \uc2 Still, the threat of being forced out of the country weighs heavily on those who announce their illegal status.\par \par \uc2 "I was super nervous," Perez said, adding: "I had to do it because in order for students to come out, they need to see something; someone needs to set the example."\par \par \uc2 The hardest thing, she said, was when she told her mother her plans the night before the rally and her mother apologized for putting her in a difficult situation.\par \par \uc2 "It's like you can't really fully live your life here, and she knows that and it breaks her heart," Perez said, choking up. "I thank her for bringing me here. I told her, `Don't ever say that again. Don't apologize.'"\par \par \uc2 Abdollahi moved to Georgia earlier this year to help organize young people who oppose a new policy that bars illegal immigrants from the state's most competitive public colleges and universities. They're also speaking out against the state's new law that, among other things, authorizes law enforcement officers to check the immigration status of suspects who cannot provide identification and to detain illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Guerrero reached out to Perez to ask her to give a presentation at her school on the DREAM Act, legislation that would provide a path to legalization for certain young people brought to the U.S. illegally by their parents. The bill has been introduced several times in Congress but has yet to make it through. They kept in touch and Guerrero first spoke out at the rally in March, not long after her mother's January arrest. She spoke out again at the rally in April and also organized a walkout at her high school last month.\par \par \uc2 Her parents are extremely protective and she talks to them about how they've given up so much to raise her and her brothers here, she said. They're proud of her and support her speaking out, but they're scared, she said.\par \par \uc2 "They've brought me as far as they can," she said. "It's time for me to take my decisions and walk on my own, and if that means publicly coming out as undocumented to empower other students, that's what I'm gonna do."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writer Garance Burke in San Francisco contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110623e76n003bu\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 MANILA, Philippines (AP) - The Filipino mother of a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist who came out as an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  in the U.S. told The Associated Press that she tried to persuade him to keep quiet.\par \par \uc2 Jose Antonio Vargas' mother, Emelie Salinas, sent him from the Philippines to live with his grandparents in California when he was 12 and has not seen him in person since.\par \par \uc2 She said in a telephone interview from her residence near Manila on Thursday evening that she worried about the consequences of his revelations to the U.S. media and tried to stop him, thinking all of his hard work and achievements might be wasted.\par \par \uc2 "We could not understand ... he was already there, he already achieved his dream, what else did he want?" she said.\par \par \uc2 At the end, she said she supported him because it was his choice.\par \par \uc2 Vargas, 30, who shared a Pulitzer Prize for coverage of the Virginia Tech massacre as a reporter for The Washington Post, says he didn't know about his citizenship status until four years after he arrived in the U.S., when he applied for a driver's permit and handed a clerk his green card.\par \par \uc2 "This is fake," a Department of Motor Vehicles clerk said, according to Vargas' account. "Don't come back here again."\par \par \uc2 Vargas confronted his grandfather, who acknowledged he purchased the green card and other fake documents.\par \par \uc2 Salinas, 53, a former office assistant, said that her son was ready for the consequences of his action -- a possiblity of deportation -- and has already obtained a Philippine passport.\par \par \uc2 He has been wanting to see his family in the Philippines and has promised his younger sister, whose nursing education he is financing, that he would come home for her graduation next year, she said.\par \par \uc2 He also has a 14-year-old brother who he has only seen via the Internet.\par \par \uc2 "We are excited to see him," Salinas added. "I just hope he can come home with his documents in order."\par \par \uc2 When she sent him off to America, Salinas said she promised she would follow him and had applied several times for a U.S. visa but was denied.\par \par \uc2 She said that she felt her son resented her unfulfilled promise and for a time after he went to college, he seldom called or wrote letters. But she said they reconnected after he joined The Washington Post.\par \par \uc2 Salinas, who separated from Vargas' father when the boy was 3, said she could not afford to send her son to school in the Philippines. She said she sent him to his grandparents in the U.S. because like any mother, she wanted a good future for him.\par \par \uc2 "In the beginning, there were times I would think I wish I did not send him there, I wish we could be together especially during special occasions," she said. "But I saw what he was doing ... I saw that he was achieving his dreams, getting the things which he could not get here."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110623e76n00322\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Republicans exit budget talks, point to Democrats' demands for tax increases along with cuts\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans pulled out of debt-reduction talks led by Vice President Joe Biden with a flourish on Thursday, blaming Democrats for demanding tax increases as part of a deal rather than accepting more than $1 trillion in cuts to Medicare and other government programs.\par \par \uc2 "Let me be clear: Tax hikes are off the table," said House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio.\par \par \uc2 Boehner spoke shortly after the House GOP second-in-command, Majority Leader Eric Cantor, announced he would not attend a planned negotiating session and said it is "time for President Obama to speak clearly and resolve the tax issue."\par \par \uc2 White House spokesman Jay Carney quickly obliged, while announcing that the talks were "in abeyance." He said Obama supports a "balanced approach" to debt reduction.\par \par \uc2 "I would point that the president supports a balanced approach," Carney said. "He does not support an approach that provides for a $200,000 tax cut for millionaires and billionaires paid for by a $6,000 a year hike in expenses and costs for seniors."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 US and other nations will free 60 million barrels of oil, largest strategic release ever\par \par \uc2 NEW YORK (AP) -- The United States and other nations that depend on oil imports said Thursday they will release and sell 60 million barrels of crude from emergency stocks in an effort to ease the strain high oil prices are putting on the global economy.\par \par \uc2 The release by the International Energy Agency, a group of more than two dozen countries, covers only what the world uses roughly every 16 hours. But it was enough to send oil prices lower, at least for the moment.\par \par \uc2 In addition to helping the struggling economies of the U.S. and Europe, analysts said the move was meant as a rebuke to OPEC, which has refused to increase oil production to bring down prices.\par \par \uc2 It will be the largest sale of crude ever from world strategic reserves and only the third since the IEA was formed in 1974 after the Arab oil embargo. The IEA released oil in 2005 after Hurricane Katrina and in 1990 and 1991 after Iraq invaded Kuwait.\par \par \uc2 Half the oil will come from reserves in the U.S. Refiners who turn crude into gasoline will be able to bid on the extra oil and have it shipped to them from the salt caverns along the Gulf Coast where it is stored.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 AP-GfK Poll: Bachmann, Pawlenty make gains as Republicans get better acquainted with GOP field\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans are starting to pay more attention to the candidates who hope to take on President Barack Obama next year, and so far that's been a good thing for Michele Bachmann and Tim Pawlenty. Not for Newt Gingrich.\par \par \uc2 Overall, a new Associated Press-GfK poll shows, Republicans are giving the field of challengers a so-so assessment as interest in the race increases. And, with growing doubts among Americans that Obama deserves re-election, Democratic interest in the GOP field is significant, too.\par \par \uc2 Bachmann, a three-term congresswoman supported by many tea party members, enjoyed a big boost in her favorability rating among Republicans after she turned in a smooth debate performance this month and joined the presidential race.\par \par \uc2 Former Minnesota Gov. Pawlenty also made progress with Republicans, particularly among tea party supporters. GOP field leader Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, held steady in the eyes of Republicans -- but gained no ground -- with the formal launch of his campaign. Former House Speaker Gingrich, who announced his campaign five weeks ago, was heading in the wrong direction.\par \par \uc2 The Georgian's favorability rating among Republicans plunged in one month from 61 percent to 43 percent as his campaign was plagued by massive staff defections, abysmal fund-raising and reports that he and his wife had racked up huge bills at luxury jeweler Tiffany's.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Mullen and Clinton say Obama's Afghanistan withdrawal plan riskier than military prefers\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's top military officer and its top diplomat made clear Thursday that President Barack Obama rejected the advice of his generals in choosing a quicker path to winding down the war in Afghanistan.\par \par \uc2 The Obama troop withdrawal plan, widely interpreted as marking the beginning of the end of the U.S. combat role in Afghanistan, drew criticism from both sides of the political aisle on Capitol Hill. Some Republicans decried it as undercutting the military mission at a critical stage of the war, while many Democrats called it too timid.\par \par \uc2 Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., took a swipe at Obama from the Senate floor, questioning the timing of his troop pullout plan.\par \par \uc2 "Just when they are one year away from turning over a battered and broken enemy in both southern and eastern Afghanistan to our Afghan partners -- the president has now decided to deny them the forces that our commanders believe they need to accomplish their objective," McCain said.\par \par \uc2 Obama announced Wednesday night that he will pull 10,000 troops from Afghanistan by December and another 23,000 by the end of next summer.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Pressure building on Obama on gay marriage as NY Legislature nears historic vote on issue\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Barack Obama's "evolving" stance on gay marriage was headed for a high-profile test Thursday as he prepared for his first-ever fundraiser for gay donors just as New York lawmakers maneuvered toward a historic vote legalizing gay nuptials.\par \par \uc2 The outcome of the negotiations in Albany, the state capital, remained uncertain, but the vote could occur just hours before Obama's event Thursday evening in New York City.\par \par \uc2 The coincidence of timing and place was shining an unavoidable spotlight on the piece of Obama's record that causes greatest consternation for the gay community: his failure to endorse gay marriage.\par \par \uc2 Activists announced plans to protest outside Thursday's gala at a Manhattan Sheraton, where as many as 600 guests were paying up to $35,800 each to attend Obama's first fundraiser geared specifically toward the gay community.\par \par \uc2 Activists say Obama got off to a slow start as president on their priority issues, but he won many over by repealing the ban on gays serving openly in the military and by instructing the Justice Department to stop defending in court a federal law defining marriage as between a man and a woman.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Feared Boston mob boss Whitey Bulger captured near LA after 16 years on the run\par \par \uc2 SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) -- As the FBI chased leads on two continents, Boston mob boss James "Whitey" Bulger lived nearly all of his 16 years on the lam in this quiet seaside city, passing himself off as just another elderly retiree, albeit one who kept a .357 Magnum and more than 100 rounds of ammunition in his modest apartment.\par \par \uc2 Bulger -- the FBI's most-wanted man and a feared underworld figure linked to 19 murders -- was captured Wednesday after one of the biggest manhunts in U.S. history. His undoing may have been his impeccably groomed girlfriend.\par \par \uc2 Earlier this week, after years of frustration, the FBI put out a series of daytime TV announcements with photos of Bulger's blond-haired live-in companion, Catherine Greig. The announcements pointed out that Greig was known to frequent beauty salons and have her teeth cleaned once a month.\par \par \uc2 Two days later, the campaign produced a tip that led agents to the two-bedroom apartment three blocks from the Pacific Ocean where Bulger, 81, and Greig, 60, lived, authorities said. The FBI would not give any details about the tip.\par \par \uc2 The boss of South Boston's vicious Winter Hill Gang -- a man who authorities say would not hesitate to shoot someone between the eyes -- was lured outside the building and captured without resistance. Greig was also arrested.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Reps. Barney Frank, Ron Paul want to end federal ban on marijuana, cede enforcement to states\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two House members introduced a bill Thursday that would remove marijuana from the list of federal controlled substances and cede to the states enforcement of laws governing pot.\par \par \uc2 The legislation would eliminate marijuana-specific penalties under federal law, but would maintain a ban on transporting marijuana across state lines. It would allow individuals to grow and sell marijuana in states that make it legal.\par \par \uc2 The bill has no chance of passing the Republican-controlled House.\par \par \uc2 \u160\'00\'A0The bill was introduced by Democrat Barney Frank of Massachusetts and Ron Paul, a Texas Republican running for his party's presidential nomination.\par \par \uc2 Four Democrats are co-sponsors: John Conyers of Michigan, Barbara Lee of California, Jared Polis of Colorado and Steve Cohen of Tennessee.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Illegal immigrant\uc2  youth 'come out' in risky bid to ease rules for those brought to US as kids\par \par \uc2 ATLANTA (AP) -- Eighteen-year-old Dulce Guerrero kept quiet about being an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  until earlier this year, when she became upset after a traffic stop that landed her mother in jail for two nights. The arrest came as Georgia lawmakers were crafting what would become one of the nation's toughest immigration crackdowns, and Guerrero feared her mother would be deported.\par \par \uc2 "I feel like that was my breaking point, when my mom was in jail," said Guerrero, who came to the U.S. from Mexico when she was 2. "I felt like, well, that's it, it can't get any worse than this. My mother has been to jail."\par \par \uc2 Guerrero first publicly announced her immigration status at a protest in March, and now she's organizing a rally under the tutelage of more experienced activists who are themselves only a few years older. The high-stakes movement of young illegal immigrants declaring that they're "undocumented and unafraid" got a boost this week when a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist revealed he's been living in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 Guerrero is the chief organizer of a rally set for Tuesday at the Georgia State Capitol for high school-age illegal immigrants to tell their stories. The recent high school graduate and others hope to draw attention to the plight of the hundreds of thousands of young people who were brought to the U.S. illegally by their parents.\par \par \uc2 Already around the country, efforts by young activists have ranged from rallies and letter-writing to sit-ins and civil disobedience, drawing inspiration from civil rights demonstrations decades ago, with the aim of forcing the federal government to reform rules for immigrants in their situation.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Bone with image of mammoth or mastodon, at least 13,000 years old, found in Florida\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some of the earliest Americans turn out to have been artists. A bone fragment at least 13,000 years old, with the carved image of a mammoth or mastodon, has been discovered in Florida, a new study reports.\par \par \uc2 While prehistoric art depicting animals with trunks has been found in Europe, this may be the first in the Western Hemisphere, researchers report Wednesday in the Journal of Archaeological Science.\par \par \uc2 "It's pretty exciting, we haven't found anything like this in North America," said Dennis J. Stanford, curator of North American Archaeology at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History, who was a co-author of the report.\par \par \uc2 They hunted these animals, Stanford explained, and "you see people drawing all kinds of pictures that are of relevance and importance to them."\par \par \uc2 "Much of the real significance of such finds is in the tangible, emotional connection they allow us to feel with people in the deep past," said Dietrich Stout, an anthropologist at Emory University in Atlanta, who was not part of the research team.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Judge finds Lohan didn't violate probation but orders her to stop partying on house arrest\par \par \uc2 LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The house party is over for Lindsay Lohan, at least while she's on house arrest. Superior Court Judge Stephanie Sautner chided Lohan for having rooftop parties at her home while serving house arrest on a probation violation but said the actress hadn't violated any other rules.\par \par \uc2 "If you are guilty of some violation of your probation, I don't see it," Sautner said. "What you are guilty of is extremely poor judgment."\par \par \uc2 Lohan tearfully hugged her attorney, Shawn Holley, after the hearing.\par \par \uc2 Earlier, the actress told Sautner she wanted to put her court troubles behind her.\par \par \uc2 "Do you want to get on with your life, tell me," Sautner asked.\par \par \uc2 "Yes, I do," Lohan replied. It was the only time she spoke during the hearing.\par \par \uc2 The judge said Lohan didn't violate her probation by testing positive for alcohol during a recent test. The testing requirement, imposed by another judge, ended in February.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110623e76n0028u\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

A D.C.

Barbara Lee, a California Democrat, offered the amendment, saying local elected officials should be allowed to make their own spending decisions.

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc12}{\*\bkmkend toc12}\b \uc2 Former Washington Post journalist says he is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , plans push for DREAM Act\b0\par\par\uc2 By BRETT ZONGKER   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 1,191 \uc2 words\par \uc2 23 June 2011\par 17:57\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2011.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) - For the past eight years, journalist Jose Antonio Vargas worried about a looming deadline: the expiration of an illegally obtained Oregon driver's license that had allowed him to get his first full-time job at a top U.S. newspaper.\par \par \uc2 The 30-year-old Pulitzer Prize-winner who covered the Virginia Tech massacre for The Washington Post was using the license with a false address to help cover up a secret: He was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 He could have opted for a reprieve. Vargas recently obtained a Washington state driver's license, offering him five more years to be able to document his residency in the U.S. -- but that also would mean five more years of lying.\par \par \uc2 Instead, he decided to go public.\par \par \uc2 "I'm done running. I'm exhausted," Vargas wrote in a \uc2 New York Times Magazine\uc2  essay posted online Wednesday. "I don't want that life anymore."\par \par \uc2 Vargas, whose mother sent him from the Philippines to live with his grandparents in California when he was 12, said he now wants to push Congress to pass a bill called the DREAM Act and open a path to citizenship for people like him if they go to college or serve in the military.\par \par \uc2 Vargas referred a request for comment from The Associated Press to his public relations team, which did not immediately make him available Wednesday. He also spoke to ABC News in interviews that will air Thursday and Friday.\par \par \uc2 He says he didn't know about his citizenship status until four years after he arrived in the U.S., when he applied for a driver's permit and handed a clerk his green card.\par \par \uc2 "This is fake," a Department of Motor Vehicles clerk said, according to Vargas' account. "Don't come back here again."\par \par \uc2 Vargas confronted his grandfather, who acknowledged he purchased the green card and other fake documents.\par \par \uc2 "I remember the very first instinct was, `OK, that's it, get rid of the accent,'" Vargas told ABC. "Because I just thought to myself, you know, I couldn't give anybody any reason to ever doubt that I'm an American."\par \par \uc2 He convinced himself that if he worked hard enough and achieved enough, he would be rewarded with citizenship, Vargas wrote in the magazine piece.\par \par \uc2 When Vargas also told his grandfather he was gay, however, it made life even more difficult. He was kicked out of his house for a few weeks in high school -- and his grandfather said Vargas needed to marry an American woman in order to get a green card.\par \par \uc2 His grandfather had imagined the fake documents would help Vargas get low-wage jobs. College seemed out of reach, until Vargas told Mountain View High School Principal Pat Hyland and school district Superintendent Rich Fisher about his problem. They became mentors and surrogate parents, eventually finding a scholarship fund for high-achieving students that allowed him to attend San Francisco State University.\par \par \uc2 Vargas found internships at The San Francisco Chronicle and the Philadelphia Daily News. He was denied an internship at The Seattle Times because he didn't have all the documents they required. But he kept applying and got an offer from The Washington Post.\par \par \uc2 The newspaper required a driver's license, so Vargas said his network of mentors helped him get one from Oregon, which has less stringent requirements than some other states.\par \par \uc2 Once hired full-time at the Post, he used the Oregon license to cover Washington events, including a state dinner at the White House, Vargas recalled.\par \par \uc2 He wrote that he felt nearly paralyzed with anxiety that his secret would be found out at the Post. He tried to avoid reporting on immigration policy, but at times, it was impossible. At one point, he wrote about then-Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton's position on driver's licenses for illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Vargas eventually told his mentor, Peter Perl, now the newspaper's training director. Perl told him that once he had accomplished more, they would tell then-Editor Leonard Downie Jr. and Post Chairman \uc2 Don Graham\uc2  together. They kept the secret until Vargas left the paper.\par \par \uc2 On Wednesday, Washington Post spokeswoman Kris Coratti condemned their actions.\par \par \uc2 "What Jose did was wrong. What Peter did was wrong," Coratti said, declining to comment further on personnel matters. "We are also reviewing our internal procedures, and we believe this was an isolated incident of deception."\par \par \uc2 An e-mail seeking comment was sent to Perl.\par \par \uc2 The Post originally planned to publish Vargas' story, but decided not to. Coratti would not say why.\par \par \uc2 In an article published Wednesday evening on the Post's website, the newspaper reported that Vargas approached his old newspaper in March about writing his story. It was to be published Sunday.\par \par \uc2 But Executive Editor Marcus Brauchli killed it several days before its scheduled publication. Brauchli declined to discuss the reasons with the Post reporter in the Wednesday article.\par \par \uc2 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokeswoman Cori W. Bassett would not comment specifically on Vargas' case Wednesday but said the agency prioritizes cases that pose the most significant threat to public safety.\par \par \uc2 William Perez, a professor at California's Claremont Graduate University who has written about the DREAM Act, said "coming out" as an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  can provide some protection for a young person facing deportation by drumming up support and public outcry. It also raises awareness that many in the same situation can't simply apply for citizenship in the U.S. They would have to go back to their countries and start the process from scratch, which could take years, except for rare cases where employers sponsor immigrants or they find other connections.\par \par \uc2 "It is that much harder for folks who are gay or lesbian because that path to citizenship through marriage is simply not an option," Perez said.\par \par \uc2 An increasing number of college graduates have "come out" in recent years as members of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  families. Twelve states now provide in-state tuition for students like Vargas, creating a new crop of savvy immigrant advocates.\par \par \uc2 "They're frustrated because they have the preparation, they have the skills and they have no options," Perez said. "So for them, this is one of the few remaining options to try to influence national policies."\par \par \uc2 Vargas shared a Pulitzer Prize for the Post's coverage of the Virginia Tech shootings. A 2006 series he wrote on the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Washington inspired a documentary film. Last year, he wrote a profile of \uc2 Facebook\uc2  CEO Mark Zuckerberg for The New Yorker.\par \par \uc2 Most recently, Vargas was a senior contributing editor at Huffington Post.\par \par \uc2 On Wednesday, he launched a campaign called Define American to use stories of immigrants like him to urge Congress and the Obama administration to pursue immigration reform. His high school principal and superintendent have signed on as board members.\par \par \uc2 "You can call me whatever you want to call me, but I am an American," Vargas told ABC. "No one can take that away from me."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Online:\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.defineamerican.com/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.defineamerican.com/}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110623e76n0008v\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Obama says gay couples deserve same rights as all\par \par \uc2 NEW YORK (AP) -- President Barack Obama praised New York state lawmakers who were debating landmark legislation Thursday to legalize gay marriage, saying that's what democracy's all about. But the president stopped short of embracing same-sex marriage himself. "I believe that gay couples deserve the same legal rights as every other couple in this country," the president said at a fundraiser in Manhattan, his first geared specifically to the gay community. Coincidentally, the long-planned event occurred just as lawmakers in Albany were debating legislation that would make New York the sixth state to legalize gay marriage.\par \par \uc2 Republicans bail on budget talks, blame Democrats\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans pulled out of debt-reduction talks led by Vice President Joe Biden with a flourish on Thursday, blaming Democrats for demanding tax increases as part of a deal rather than accepting more than $1 trillion in cuts to Medicare and other government programs. "Let me be clear: Tax hikes are off the table," said House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio.\par \par \uc2 US and others plan biggest release of reserve oil\par \par \uc2 NEW YORK (AP) -- The United States and other nations that depend on oil imports will release and sell 60 million barrels of crude from emergency stocks in an effort to ease the strain of high oil prices on the global economy. The release by the International Energy Agency, a group of more than two dozen countries, covers only what the world uses roughly every 16 hours. But it was enough to send oil prices lower, at least for the moment.\par \par \uc2 AP-GfK Poll: Bachmann, Pawlenty gain in GOP field\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans are starting to pay more attention to the candidates who hope to take on President Barack Obama next year, and so far that's been a good thing for Michele Bachmann and Tim Pawlenty. Not for Newt Gingrich. Overall, a new Associated Press-GfK poll shows, Republicans are giving the field of challengers a so-so assessment as interest in the race increases. And, with growing doubts among Americans that Obama deserves re-election, Democratic interest in the GOP field is significant, too.\par \par \uc2 Boston mob boss was hiding in plain sight\par \par \uc2 SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) -- As the FBI chased leads on two continents, Boston mob boss James "Whitey" Bulger spent nearly all of his 16 years on the lam in this quiet seaside city, passing himself off as just another elderly retiree, albeit one who kept a .357 Magnum and more than 100 rounds of ammunition in his modest apartment. Bulger -- the FBI's most-wanted man and a feared underworld figure linked to 19 murders -- was captured Wednesday after one of the biggest manhunts in U.S. history. His undoing may have been his impeccably groomed girlfriend.\par \par \uc2 Mullen sees risk in Obama's Afghanistan withdrawal\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's top military officer and its top diplomat made clear Thursday that President Barack Obama rejected the advice of his generals in choosing a quicker path to winding down the war in Afghanistan. The Obama troop withdrawal plan, widely interpreted as marking the beginning of the end of the U.S. combat role in Afghanistan, drew criticism from both sides of the political aisle on Capitol Hill. Some Republicans decried it as undercutting the military mission at a critical stage of the war, while many Democrats called it too timid.\par \par \uc2 Reps. Frank, Paul want to end federal ban on pot\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two House members introduced a bill Thursday that would remove marijuana from the list of federal controlled substances and cede to the states enforcement of laws governing pot. The legislation would eliminate marijuana-specific penalties under federal law, but would maintain a ban on transporting marijuana across state lines. It would allow individuals to grow and sell marijuana in states that make it legal.\par \par \uc2 Illegal immigrant\uc2  youth 'come out' in reform push\par \par \uc2 ATLANTA (AP) -- Eighteen-year-old Dulce Guerrero kept quiet about being an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  until earlier this year, when she became upset after a traffic stop that landed her mother in jail for two nights. The arrest came as Georgia lawmakers were crafting what would become one of the nation's toughest immigration crackdowns, and Guerrero feared her mother would be deported. "I feel like that was my breaking point, when my mom was in jail," said Guerrero, who came to the U.S. from Mexico when she was 2. "I felt like, well, that's it, it can't get any worse than this. My mother has been to jail."\par \par \uc2 Casey Anthony's mom testifies at murder trial\par \par \uc2 ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- The mother of a Florida woman accused of killing her 2-year-old daughter testified Thursday that she had conducted Internet searches about chloroform on a family computer, directly contradicting prosecutors' theory that it was the suspect who made the queries. Casey Anthony's mother, Cindy, said she had run the chloroform queries while looking up information on chlorophyll, a green pigment found in plants. She believed her dogs may have been eating bamboo leaves containing chlorophyll. Cindy Anthony also said she ran searches on other chemicals, such as hydrogen peroxide, after she was informed about a hand sanitizer scare.\par \par \uc2 Cavaliers take Irving with No. 1 pick in NBA draft\par \par \uc2 NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- The Cleveland Cavaliers selected Kyrie Irving with the No. 1 pick Thursday, making the Duke point guard their first of two choices in the top four of the NBA draft. Loudly cheered by family and friends not far from where he starred at St. Patrick's High School in Elizabeth, Irving showed no signs of any lingering problems with a right foot injury as he walked up the stairs to shake hands with Commissioner David Stern.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110623e76n0000r\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) - Federal immigration officials say they will not deport immigrants pursuing legitimate civil rights claims, a move hailed by advocates as a way to protect a vulnerable population while critics say it encourages abuses.\par \par \uc2 The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement issued a memo Friday that "absent special circumstances," it is against the agency's policy to deport immigrants in the midst of a legitimate effort to protect their civil rights. ICE officials said the memos were designed to provide guidance on exercising appropriate discretion.\par \par \uc2 The agency already allowed crime victims and witnesses to crimes to remain in the country.\par \par \uc2 "To avoid deterring individuals from reporting crimes and from pursuing actions to protect their civil rights, ICE officers, special agents and attorneys are reminded to exercise all appropriate discretion on a case-by-case basis when making detention and enforcement decisions in the cases of victims of crimes, witnesses to crime and individuals pursuing legitimate civil rights complaints," the memo states.\par \par \uc2 ICE said the policy did not stem from a single case.\par \par \uc2 Yale University professor Michael Wishnie said he and other advocates urged ICE to adopt such a policy after his client, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Ecuador, faced deportation in December while his civil rights lawsuit was pending. The lawsuit stems from a raid in 2007 in New Haven that critics said was in retaliation for the city becoming the first to offer identification cards to immigrants.\par \par \uc2 "It's quite apparent to me the catalyst for this policy in fact was that effort in December," Wishnie said.\par \par \uc2 The policy could help hundreds and eventually thousands of immigrants, including immigrants facing wage and other issues on the job, Wishnie said. Immigrants are concentrated in low wage jobs and often face abuses, but in the past might not bother to pursue such claims, believing they would be deported before the cases were resolved, he said.\par \par \uc2 The memo was "fairly strongly worded" for ICE, said Crystal Williams, executive director of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. She said the agency already had the discretion not to deport immigrants in such cases, but few officers exercised that discretion.\par \par \uc2 "When there is a civil rights complaint, one of the best ways to get rid of it was to deport the complainer," Williams said. "I don't know that anybody set out to get rid of a case that way but it winds up being a great way to get rid of cases."\par \par \uc2 Williams said there are not a lot of cases because immigrants are reluctant to file civil rights complaints.\par \par \uc2 But Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a Washington D.C.-based think tank that supports tighter immigration controls, said the policy would encourage more claims as a way to prevent deportations. He questioned how officials would determine what is a legitimate complaint.\par \par \uc2 "I have no doubt other immigration attorneys will take the hint and use this as a way of keeping their clients from being sent home," Krikorian said.\par \par \uc2 Krikorian said the Obama administration was not enthusiastic about enforcing immigration laws and was trying to ensure its civil rights allies that it was on their side.\par \par \uc2 But Gillian Christensen, an ICE spokeswoman, said the agency was prioritizing limited resources by focusing on criminal aliens who are threats to public safety. More than half the immigrants deported last year were convicted criminals, a 70 percent increase in removal of criminal immigrants from the previous administration, she said.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110622e76m0021b\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

Limas in 2008, according to the indictment. Twice, the indictment says, Marchan paid Limas in order to be appointed as ad litem attorney in civil cases. The third instance was a case in which Limas denied another attorney's motion for sanctions in exchange for $5,000 from Marchan, according to the indictment.\par \par \uc2 Marchan, a Stanford law graduate, also faces related charges of aiding and abetting mail fraud and aiding and abetting extortion.\par \par \uc2 He pleaded not guilty and U.S. Magistrate Judge Felix Recio set bond at $100,000. Neither Marchan nor his attorney Noe Garza immediately returned calls for comment.\par \par \uc2 Limas pleaded guilty to racketeering in March. Jose Santiago "Jim" Solis, a former state lawmaker, pleaded guilty in April to aiding and abetting the extortion scheme.\par \par \uc2 Cisneros was charged with conspiracy to extort and aiding and abetting extortion for allegedly paying Limas $700 to reduce someone's bond. His arraignment was scheduled for Friday. He had not yet retained counsel and could not be reached for comment.\par \par \uc2 He is accused of paying the bribe for an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who had been sentenced in 2003 to two years in prison and five years of supervised release on a drug charge. In 2008, Cisneros paid Limas to have the immigrant's bond changed from $25,000 to personal recognizance, according to the indictment.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110622e76m001vb\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) - A Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist who covered the Virginia Tech massacre for the Washington Post went public Wednesday with a secret he has been keeping for nearly two decades: He is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Jose Antonio Vargas, whose mother sent him from the Philippines to live with his grandparents in California when he was 12, says that now he wants to push Congress to pass a bill called the DREAM Act that would allow people like him to become citizens if they go to college or serve in the military.\par \par \uc2 "I'm done running. I'm exhausted," Vargas wrote in a \uc2 New York Times Magazine\uc2  essay posted online Wednesday. "I don't want that life anymore."\par \par \uc2 Vargas referred a request for comment from The Associated Press to his public relations team, which did not immediately make him available Wednesday. He also spoke to ABC News in interviews that will air Thursday and Friday.\par \par \uc2 He says he didn't know about his citizenship status until four years after he arrived in the U.S., when he applied for a driver's permit and handed a clerk his green card.\par \par \uc2 "This is fake," a Department of Motor Vehicles clerk said, according to Vargas' account. "Don't come back here again."\par \par \uc2 Vargas confronted his grandfather, who acknowledged he purchased the green card and other fake documents.\par \par \uc2 "I remember the very first instinct was, OK, that's it, get rid of the accent," Vargas told ABC. "Because I just thought to myself, you know, I couldn't give anybody any reason to ever doubt that I'm an American."\par \par \uc2 He convinced himself that if he worked hard enough and achieved enough, he would be rewarded with citizenship, Vargas wrote in the magazine piece.\par \par \uc2 His grandfather imagined the fake documents would help Vargas get low-wage jobs. College seemed out of reach, until Vargas told Mountain View High School Principal Pat Hyland and school district Superintendent Rich Fisher about his problem. They became mentors and surrogate parents, eventually finding a scholarship fund for high-achieving students that allowed him to attend San Francisco State University.\par \par \uc2 Vargas was hired for internships at The San Francisco Chronicle and the Philadelphia Daily News. He was denied an internship at The Seattle Times because he didn't have all the documents they required. But he kept applying and got an offer from The Washington Post.\par \par \uc2 The newspaper required a driver's license, so Vargas said his network of mentors helped him get one from Oregon, which has less stringent requirements than some other states.\par \par \uc2 Once hired full-time at the Post, he used the fake license to cover Washington events, including a state dinner at the White House, Vargas recalled.\par \par \uc2 He wrote that he was nearly paralyzed with anxiety that his secret would be found out at the Post. He tried to avoid reporting on immigration policy, but at times, it was impossible. At one point, he wrote about then-Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton's position on driver's licenses for illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Vargas eventually told his mentor, Peter Perl, now the newspaper's training director. Perl told him that once he had accomplished more, they would tell then-Editor Leonard Downie Jr. and Post Chairman \uc2 Don Graham\uc2  together. They kept the secret until Vargas left the paper.\par \par \uc2 On Wednesday, Washington Post spokeswoman Kris Coratti condemned their actions.\par \par \uc2 "What Jose did was wrong. What Peter did was wrong," Coratti said, declining to comment further on personnel matters. "We are also reviewing our internal procedures, and we believe this was an isolated incident of deception."\par \par \uc2 An e-mail seeking comment was sent to Perl.\par \par \uc2 The Post originally planned to publish Vargas' story, but decided not to. Coratti would not say why.\par \par \uc2 "We think it is a really interesting first-person account, and we're glad he found a place to share his story," she said.\par \par \uc2 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokeswoman Cori W. Bassett would not comment specifically on Vargas' case Wednesday but said the agency prioritizes cases that pose the most significant threat to public safety.\par \par \uc2 William Perez, a professor at California's Claremont Graduate University who has written about the DREAM Act, said "coming out" as an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  can provide some protection for a young person facing deportation by drumming up support and public outcry. It also raises awareness that many in the same situation can't simply apply for citizenship in the U.S. They would have to go back to their countries and start the process from scratch, which could take years.\par \par \uc2 Twelve states now provide in-state tuition for undocumented immigrants, and an increasing number of undocumented college graduates have "come out" in recent years.\par \par \uc2 "They're frustrated because they have the preparation, they have the skills and they have no options," Perez said. "So for them, this is one of the few remaining options to try to influence national policies."\par \par \uc2 Vargas shared a Pulitzer Prize for the Post's coverage of the Virginia Tech shootings. A 2006 series he wrote on the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Washington inspired a documentary film. Last year, he wrote a profile of \uc2 Facebook\uc2  CEO Mark Zuckerberg for The New Yorker.\par \par \uc2 Most recently, Vargas was a senior contributing editor at Huffington Post. He said he left after less than a year and was worried professionally about a looming deadline: the expiration of his 8-year-old Oregon driver's license.\par \par \uc2 Just before he turned 30 this year, Vargas said he obtained a Washington state driver's license, which would have given him a five-year reprieve -- and meant five more years of lying. He said he couldn't deal with that.\par \par \uc2 "In my heart, I'm an American," Vargas told ABC. "I am one of many, many people, and we are not who you think we are. We don't just mow your lawns and babysit your kids and serve you tacos. ... We do a really good job doing that, but we do other things, and we are a part of this society."\par \par \uc2 On Wednesday, Vargas launched a campaign called Define American to use stories of immigrants like him to urge Congress and the Obama administration to pursue immigration reform. His high school principal and superintendent have signed on as board members.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.defineamerican.com/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.defineamerican.com/}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110622e76m001qb\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - A federal judge in Knoxville has ruled that Hispanic workers do not have to reveal their immigration status to an employer they are suing to recover back wages.\par \par \uc2 David Dunaway, an attorney for Caryville-based Baird Tree Company, has argued that illegal immigrants have no right to recover wages they could not legally earn in the first place. The firm is demanding to know which of the 21 workers suing the company are here illegally.\par \par \uc2 But U.S. Magistrate Judge Bruce Guyton ruled earlier this month that workers must be paid for the hours they work, regardless of immigration status, according to the Knoxville News Sentinel.\par \par \uc2 The ruling is the first of its kind in the Sixth Circuit, but in 2002 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a company had the right to know the legal status of worker Jose Castro, who was suing for wages lost after he was laid off for union organizing.\par \par \uc2 In that case, the Supreme Court ruled that awarding an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  unearned wages ran counter to federal immigration law prohibiting the employment of illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 But Guyton found the current case was different. Where Castro sought "unearned wages," the former Baird employees are seeking pay for work already performed. Lower courts have largely held that employers cannot deny workers wages already earned simply because they are illegal immigrants, according to the ruling.\par \par \uc2 "Courts have held that immigration status is not . relevant where a worker seeks wages that were previously earned through actual work," Guyton wrote. "Thus, the court finds . (Baird workers') immigration status is not relevant to their claims and, therefore, (the workers) will not be required to (disclose) their immigration status."\par \par \uc2 The workers' attorneys, Arthur Knight III and Patrick Looper, have said that at least some of their clients are illegal immigrants. They insist Baird was aware of their clients' status when the company hired them. Baird officials insist they were duped by fake documents.\par \par \uc2 The company is appealing Guyton's ruling. The case is set for trial in July.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Information from: The Knoxville News Sentinel, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.knoxnews.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.knoxnews.com}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110622e76m001oo\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) - Opponents of Alabama's tough new illegal immigration law said Tuesday they are planning an interfaith march against the act, which they call unjust and a potential restriction on church ministries.\par \par \uc2 More than a dozen groups including the Episcopal Diocese of Alabama, Greater Birmingham Ministries, the Alabama Coalition for Immigrant Justice and the Hispanic Interest Coalition of Alabama will sponsor a "candle march" at Birmingham's Linn Park on Saturday evening.\par \par \uc2 Organizers said in a statement the march is designed to "change minds at the grass-roots level by making a beautiful, very public vision of many faiths in unison in opposition to Alabama's unjust immigration legislation."\par \par \uc2 "I think it's going to be huge. We've had almost 1,000 people say they're coming on \uc2 Facebook\uc2 . We've had calls from people in Gadsden, Montgomery, Huntsville, Mobile and Tuscaloosa saying they're coming," said the Rev. Angie Wright of Beloved Community Church in Birmingham, an organizer.\par \par \uc2 Both supporters and opponents of the state law consider it the nation's toughest targeting illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, the president of the Alabama Baptist State Convention, the Rev. Mike Shaw, expressed mixed feelings. Shaw, pastor of First Baptist Church of Pelham, said all laws need to be enforced, but he is worried about the potential effects on church ministries.\par \par \uc2 "I am concerned about the language concerning giving a ride in an automobile to an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  or allowing children of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  parents to ride on a church bus to Sunday school, vacation Bible school or church camp," Shaw said in an email exchange. "Should we ignore people who are injured or have broken down on the side of a busy interstate highway and have small children in sweltering heat with no family or friends to help them?"\par \par \uc2 Shaw said he could not speak for anyone but himself, and he does not know if the state denomination will consider a resolution on the new immigration law when it meets in November.\par \par \uc2 The law, signed by Gov. Robert Bentley earlier this month, makes it a crime to knowingly hire an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 ; rent them a place to live; or give them a ride in a vehicle. It requires schools to determine the immigration status of their students and report it to the state, although children in the country illegally would not be refused an education. It takes effect Sept. 1.\par \par \uc2 Leaders of the United Methodist Church, the Episcopal Church, the Lutheran Church and the Roman Catholic Church all have criticized the law as running counter to biblical teachings about caring for neighbors, helping visitors and showing hospitality to strangers.\par \par \uc2 A public forum on the law is planned for next week at Birmingham's Highlands United Methodist Church in Birmingham.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110621e76l0032p\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc21}{\*\bkmkend toc21}\b \uc2 Civil liberties groups ask federal judge to block Ga. law targeting illegal immigrants\b0\par\par\uc2 By KATE BRUMBACK   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 803 \uc2 words\par \uc2 20 June 2011\par 16:45\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2011.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ATLANTA (AP) - Civil liberties groups argued Monday that Georgia's law cracking down on illegal immigration should not take effect until a lawsuit challenging it as unconstitutional is resolved, and a judge said he likely would rule on that request before the law takes effect.\par \par \uc2 The lawsuit asks a judge to find the law unconstitutional and to prevent its enforcement. U.S. District Judge Thomas Thrash, who was appointed to the bench by former President Bill Clinton, also heard arguments from a lawyer for the state, who said the lawsuit should be dismissed. Thrash repeatedly questioned Senior Assistant Attorney General Devon Orland, with the exchange sometimes bordering on testy.\par \par \uc2 Omar Jadwat with the American Civil Liberties Union argued the law is fundamentally unconstitutional and infringes on federal authority, while Orland said the measure is needed because medical facilities and prisons are being strained by illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 The possible harm the law could inflict on people and organizations is greater than any harm done to the state without the law, so it should be blocked until the courts rule on the merits of the legal challenge, said Karen Tumlin from the National Immigration Law Center.\par \par \uc2 At the end of the hearing, Thrash said he needs more time to consider the arguments because the legal and constitutional issues at play are complex. He expects to decide on the issue before July 1, when most parts of the law take effect.\par \par \uc2 "We're optimistic," Jadwat said after the hearing. "The judge seemed to grasp a lot of the practical problems posed by this law."\par \par \uc2 The attorney general's office said it's waiting for the judge's ruling and declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 The measure authorizes law enforcement officers to check the immigration status of suspects who cannot provide identification and to detain and hand over to federal authorities anyone found to be in the country illegally. It also penalizes people who, while committing another crime, knowingly transport or harbor illegal immigrants and makes it a felony to present false documents or information when applying for a job.\par \par \uc2 During the hearing, Thrash on more than one occasion told Orland not to interrupt him and said she wasn't answering his questions.\par \par \uc2 The judge expressed concern that the new law allows individual jurisdictions too much discretion, effectively creating a different policy in every county. He also questioned the motive behind the law. Orland responded that it was to prevent the state from continuing to spend money on illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 "So they're supposed to go somewhere else with their husbands, their wives, their children, even though some of them may be U.S. citizens?" Thrash asked.\par \par \uc2 Thrash later questioned provisions dealing with people who harbor or transport illegal immigrants, raising a hypothetical scenario of an 18-year-old U.S. citizen who gets pulled over for speeding while driving his mother, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , to the store.\par \par \uc2 "It would be no different if his mother had pockets full of cocaine and he was knowingly transporting her to go sell it," Orland said, later adding: "Sometimes the law is harsh. There is no question about that. That does not make it unconstitutional."\par \par \uc2 Orland also said that other parts of the law would actually protect illegal immigrants from exploitation, and that parts of the state policy mirror federal immigration law.\par \par \uc2 Jadwat argued that the state isn't mirroring federal law because the Georgia law gives local officers such broad enforcement discretion, and that the state is not authorized to enforce certain parts of federal law.\par \par \uc2 Georgia's law has provisions similar to those in laws enacted in Arizona, Utah and Indiana.\par \par \uc2 A federal judge blocked the most controversial parts of Arizona's law last year after the U.S. Department of Justice sued, arguing that only the federal government can regulate immigration. A federal appeals court judge upheld the decision, and Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer has said she plans to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.\par \par \uc2 A federal judge also has temporarily blocked Utah's law, citing similarities to the most controversial parts of Arizona's law. A hearing is set for mid-July to determine if the law can take effect. And in Indiana, a federal judge on Monday heard arguments on whether that state's law can take effect next month. Like in Georgia, that judge listened to the arguments and said she'd rule before the law is set to take effect July 1.\par \par \uc2 Another section of the Georgia law set to be phased in starting in January will require many businesses to check the immigration status of new hires. A separate Arizona law with the same requirement was recently upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110620e76k0011p\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHOENIX (AP) - An outside audit praised an ethnic studies program in Arizona as promoting peace and racial harmony, a dramatically different conclusion than that of the state's schools chief, who says the course promotes resentment toward white people.\par \par \uc2 The report by the Cambium Learning Group said it found no evidence that the Tucson Unified School District's program promotes racial tension.\par \par \uc2 "The auditors observed the opposite, as students are taught to be accepting of multiple ethnicities of people," according to the 120-page report. "Teachers are teaching Cesar Chavez alongside Martin Luther King Jr. and Ghandi, all as peaceful protesters who sacrificed for people and ideas they believed in."\par \par \uc2 The assessment comes days after Superintendent of Public Instruction John Huppenthal determined the program to be in violation of a new state law that says classes cannot advocate ethnic solidarity or promote ethnic resentment. In an announcement Wednesday in which he cited the audit, Huppenthal gave the district two months to make changes or face losing 10 percent of its annual state funding -- or about $15 million.\par \par \uc2 Huppenthal told The Associated Press on Friday that he thinks the classrooms were warned that the auditors would be there and that the findings weren't an accurate depiction of the program.\par \par \uc2 "We reject totally what they observed," Huppenthal told The Associated Press. "We disagree that it was in fact an audit. We disagree with those findings being representative of ethnic studies classes."\par \par \uc2 Supporters of the ethnic studies program have called challenges to the course attacks on Arizona's Hispanic population.\par \par \uc2 Critics say the program demonizes white people as oppressors of Hispanics.\par \par \uc2 The battle over the Tucson program escalated as Arizona lawmakers passed the nation's most stringent -- and controversial -- anti-\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  legislation.\par \par \uc2 Following a lawsuit by the U.S. Department of Justice, a federal judge blocked the law's key provisions -- including requirements that police use "reasonable suspicion" as grounds to question a person's immigration status. Arizona has sued the federal government over the ruling and the fight seems headed for the U.S. Supreme Court.\par \par \uc2 Critics say the law unfairly targets Hispanics. Supporters say the legislation is necessary to prevent illegal immigrants from crossing into the country along Arizona's border.\par \par \uc2 Republican Gov. Jan Brewer signed both the ethnic studies law and the immigration law in a two-month period last spring. Both were heavily supported by Republicans including Tom Horne, who was the schools superintendent at the time and had been pushing the ethnic studies measure for years.\par \par \uc2 Huppenthal, also a Republican, voted in favor of the ethnic studies law as a state senator and ordered the audit when he took over as schools superintendent.\par \par \uc2 The audit said that "all ethnicities are welcomed into the program" and that "all evidence points to peace as the essence for program teachings."\par \par \uc2 "Resentment does not exist in the context of these courses," auditors wrote.\par \par \uc2 However, Huppenthal said Wednesday that the reviewed course materials violate the new law because they "present only one perspective of historical events -- that of the Latino people being persecuted, oppressed and subjugated by the `hegemony' -- otherwise known in this material as white America."\par \par \uc2 Spokesman Andrew LeFevre said Friday that the auditors gathered information during "limited classroom observations and onsite interviews," rather than from a profusion of text materials collected by a separate, intensive investigation by the education department that spanned several months.\par \par \uc2 LeFevre said that Huppenthal "used the totality of the information and facts gathered during the monthslong investigation to make his final determination."\par \par \uc2 Among the program materials that Huppenthal said were in violation of the state law included passages such as:\par \par \uc2 "We will now see the real forces behind this so-called `manifest destiny.' We will see how half of Mexico was ripped off by trickery and violence," according to a quote from a source called "American History from a Chicana/o Perspective," provided by the department.\par \par \uc2 "In the process of being colonized, we were robbed of land and other resources," according to the quote. "We were murdered and lynched."\par \par \uc2 Auditors reported that the materials they looked at during their visits did not violate the law, but said that the district's governing board should start looking at supplemental materials for the program and decide whether to approve them. The board currently only approves "basic text materials," the audit said.\par \par \uc2 The auditors said they visited every school in the district with ethnic studies classes and sat in on them in pairs. They said all visits were unannounced, and that "there was no resistance whatsoever to the audit team."\par \par \uc2 Tucson Unified School District Superintendent John Pedicone said Friday that the district board already is working on providing more oversight for course materials.\par \par \uc2 He and the board met Friday and decided to request a judicial hearing on the matter to get clarification about why Huppenthal says the program is illegal and what the district needs to do to fix the situation.\par \par \uc2 He said Huppenthal's findings "defy the audit he himself commissioned."\par \par \uc2 "At this point we don't believe we're out of compliance, and the burden of proof is on the state superintendent," he said. "You're looking at a fairly significant audit that took place over the course of three weeks. I think you have to take that to heart."\par \par \uc2 Pedicone has said that the district can't afford to take a $15 million financial hit. "It'd be devastating."\par \par \uc2 Sixty percent of the district's 13,000 students are Hispanic, and 647 students in all were in the ethnic studies program last school year. About 90 percent of the program's students are Hispanic.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110618e76i0004z\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHOENIX (AP) - An outside audit praised an ethnic studies program in Arizona as "welcoming," a dramatically different conclusion than the state's schools chief who says the course promotes resentment toward white people.\par \par \uc2 The report by the Cambium Learning Group said it found no evidence that the Tucson Unified School District's program promotes racial tension.\par \par \uc2 "The auditors observed the opposite, as students are taught to be accepting of multiple ethnicities of people," according to the 120-page report. "Teachers are teaching Cesar Chavez alongside Martin Luther King Jr. and Ghandi, all as peaceful protesters who sacrificed for people and ideas they believed in."\par \par \uc2 The assessment comes days after Superintendent of Public Instruction John Huppenthal determined the program to be in violation of a new state law that says classes cannot advocate ethnic solidarity or promote ethnic resentment. Huppenthal gave the district two months to make changes or face losing 10 percent of its annual state funding -- or about $15 million.\par \par \uc2 Ironically, Huppenthal cited the laudatory audit when he announced his decision Wednesday. The next day he told The Arizona Republic that he "probably should have been more clear" when describing the evidence used to make his finding.\par \par \uc2 Huppenthal said Friday that he thinks the classrooms were warned that the auditors would be there and that the findings weren't an accurate depiction of the program.\par \par \uc2 "We reject totally what they observed," Huppenthal told The Associated Press. "We disagree that it was in fact an audit. We disagree with those findings being representative of ethnic studies classes."\par \par \uc2 Supporters of the ethnic studies program have called challenges to the course attacks on Arizona's Hispanic population.\par \par \uc2 Critics say the program demonizes white people as oppressors of Hispanics.\par \par \uc2 The battle over the Tucson program escalated as Arizona lawmakers passed the nation's most stringent -- and controversial -- anti-\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  legislation.\par \par \uc2 Following a lawsuit by the U.S. Department of Justice, a federal judge blocked the law's key provisions -- including requirements that police use "reasonable suspicion" as grounds to question a person's immigration status. Arizona has sued the federal government over the ruling and the fight seems headed for the U.S. Supreme Court.\par \par \uc2 Critics say the law unfairly targets Hispanics.\par \par \uc2 Supporters say the legislation is necessary to prevent illegal immigrants from crossing into the country along Arizona's border.\par \par \uc2 Republican Gov. Jan Brewer signed both the ethnic studies law and the immigration law in a two-month period last spring. Both were heavily supported by Republicans including Tom Horne, who was the schools superintendent at the time and had been pushing the measure for years.\par \par \uc2 Huppenthal, also a Republican, voted in favor of the ethnic studies law as a state senator and ordered the audit when he took over as schools superintendent.\par \par \uc2 The audit said that "all ethnicities are welcomed into the program" and that "all evidence points to peace as the essence for program teachings."\par \par \uc2 "Resentment does not exist in the context of these courses," auditors wrote.\par \par \uc2 However, Huppenthal said Wednesday that the reviewed course materials violate the new law because they "present only one perspective of historical events -- that of the Latino people being persecuted, oppressed and subjugated by the `hegemony' -- otherwise known in this material as white America."\par \par \uc2 Spokesman Andrew LeFevre said Friday that the auditors gathered information during "limited classroom observations and onsite interviews," rather than from a profusion of text materials collected by a separate, intensive investigation by the education department that spanned several months.\par \par \uc2 LeFevre said that Huppenthal "used the totality of the information and facts gathered during the monthslong investigation to make his final determination."\par \par \uc2 Among the program materials that Huppenthal said were in violation of the state law included passages such as:\par \par \uc2 "We will now see the real forces behind this so-called `manifest destiny.' We will see how half of Mexico was ripped off by trickery and violence," according to a quote from a source called "American History from a Chicana/o Perspective," provided by the department.\par \par \uc2 "In the process of being colonized, we were robbed of land and other resources," according to the quote. "We were murdered and lynched."\par \par \uc2 Auditors reported that the materials they looked at during their visits did not violate the law, but said that the district's governing board should start looking at supplemental materials for the program and decide whether to approve them. The board currently only approves "basic text materials," the audit said.\par \par \uc2 The auditors said they visited every school in the district with ethnic studies classes and sat in on them in pairs. They said all visits were unannounced, and that "there was no resistance whatsoever to the audit team."\par \par \uc2 Tucson Unified School District Superintendent John Pedicone said Friday that the district board already is working on providing more oversight for course materials.\par \par \uc2 He said he got a copy of the audit Thursday night and thought it was "really interesting that it seems to contradict what Huppenthal" has said.\par \par \uc2 He said the board was meeting Friday to discuss its course of action.\par \par \uc2 "(The audit) is really what the district's position has been," he said. "You're looking at a fairly significant audit that took place over the course of three weeks. I think you have to take that to heart."\par \par \uc2 Pedicone has said that the district can't afford to take a $15 million financial hit. "It'd be devastating."\par \par \uc2 Sixty percent of the district's 13,000 students are Hispanic, and 647 students in all were in the ethnic studies program last school year. About 90 percent of the program's students are Hispanic.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110617e76h0027x\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

"We can't afford to be Latin America's welfare system any longer."\par \par \uc2 Van Meeteren said he has spoken with veterans who have lost their jobs in favor of illegal immigrants willing to work for less.\par \par \uc2 "It's going on in an ever-increasing amount," he said.\par \par \uc2 Carson pleaded guilty June 6 to a class C misdemeanor charge of providing false statements regarding unemployment compensation. In addition to the fine, she was sentenced to one year of probation.\par \par \uc2 Carson and co-worker Teresa Bassett were employed by the Utah Department of Workforce Services. They compiled the list from people who had applied for benefits. In July 2010, the list was anonymously sent to law enforcement and media under the name Concerned Citizens of the United States, along with a note demanding the deportation of those listed.\par \par \uc2 "I apologize for my actions," Carson said during her sentencing. "I know they were really stupid, and I made a mistake. I just want to get past this."\par \par \uc2 Bassett, 59, pleaded guilty to two felony counts of computer crimes, despite maintaining her innocence during a hearing in 3rd District Court in Salt Lake City. She entered an Alford guilty plea, which means she admits no guilt but acknowledges the state has sufficient evidence for conviction.\par \par \uc2 Bassett, who recently changed her name to London Grace Wellington, was sentenced to three years of probation and 250 hours of community service.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110617e76h0026i\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) - A former Anchorage police officer accused of being an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  living under a stolen identity pleaded guilty Friday to a separate charge that he collected thousands of dollars in dividends from Alaska's oil-rich savings account available only to legitimate residents.\par \par \uc2 Rafael Mora-Lopez made the plea in Superior Court on the felony count of unsworn falsification. State prosecutors say the charge applies to someone who knowingly submits a false application for dividends from the \uc2 Alaska Permanent Fund\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Clint Campion, a supervisor in the state special prosecutions office, said Mora-Lopez also paid restitution for dividends collected the past two decades. Campion said Mora-Lopez handed over a cashier's check for $27,352.80 to Alaska revenue officials before Friday's hearing. Sentencing in the case is set for Sept. 16.\par \par \uc2 Mora-Lopez, 47, lived in Alaska more than two decades as Rafael Alberto Espinoza, a U.S. citizen who lives in Guadalajara, Mexico.\par \par \uc2 Earlier this month, Mora-Lopez pleaded guilty to federal counts of passport fraud and false claim of U.S. citizenship after initially pleading not guilty to an original count of passport fraud.\par \par \uc2 Mora-Lopez, who is married and has a child, is out on bail under home confinement and electronic monitoring. After the short plea hearing, Campion said he was comfortable with those conditions, which were set in the federal case.\par \par \uc2 "I'm satisfied that the house arrest and the electronic monitoring bracelet are sufficient to ensure that he doesn't leave the state and that he'll appear at all court hearings," Campion said. "Additionally, Mr. Mora-Lopez has no other criminal history and so I don't view him right now as a flight risk."\par \par \uc2 At his federal sentencing hearing in August, Mora-Lopez faces a maximum of 13 years in prison. He faces as much as two years in the state case.\par \par \uc2 Mora-Lopez was acquainted with Espinoza's sister and somehow obtained Espinoza's identity papers, according to the state charging documents. Federal court papers say Mora-Lopez's wife was a neighbor of the real Rafael Alberto Espinoza in Guadalajara, Mexico, in the 1980s.\par \par \uc2 Until his April arrest, Mora-Lopez was a well-regarded police officer, a job he held for six years. He previously worked as a city bus driver for six years.\par \par \uc2 Mora-Lopez was born in Mexico City and later lived in Guadalajara, according to the state charging documents. He came to Alaska in 1989 on a travel visa, the papers say.\par \par \uc2 That same year, authorities say, Mora-Lopez used Rafael Espinoza's name, Social Security number and date of birth to apply for a state driver's license. Besides receiving permanent fund dividends, Mora-Lopez also used the false identity to vote in national and local elections, according to the federal court papers.\par \par \uc2 Mora-Lopez also used the assumed identity and citizenship to bring his future wife to Alaska and help her obtain naturalization as a U.S. citizen, the documents say. No charges have been filed against the wife, Margarita Cynthia Espinoza.\par \par \uc2 Authorities said Mora-Lopez's true identity was discovered after he applied for a passport renewal and the State Department noted someone else appeared to have a passport under the same identity.\par \par \uc2 Authorities said a pre-employment background check by police on Mora-Lopez found nothing because neither he nor Rafael Espinoza had any known criminal record. Mora-Lopez also passed a polygraph test.\par \par \uc2 The case leaves police facing complications including potential challenges to Mora-Lopez's testimony in past criminal trials and his pension earned under the false identity.\par \par \uc2 The police department is preparing a spread sheet of all the cases Mora-Lopez worked on in anticipation about potential challenges.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110617e76h001bz\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) - Some churches are objecting to Alabama's tough new law that aims to clamp down on illegal immigration, saying it violates Christian principles in the heart of the Bible Belt.\par \par \uc2 Leaders of the United Methodist Church, the Episcopal Church, the Lutheran Church and the Roman Catholic Church all have criticized the law as running counter to biblical teachings about caring for neighbors, helping visitors and showing hospitality to strangers. Episcopal Bishop Henry N. Parsley of Birmingham said the law "will make it impossible to love and be hospitable to our neighbors as we ought to be."\par \par \uc2 "It is a profoundly disappointing decision and a sad moment for our state," he said in a statement late Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 The state's largest denomination, the Alabama Baptist Convention, hasn't taken a position publicly and likely won't because it doesn't speak for autonomous, individual churches. But the Thursday edition of its widely read state newspaper, The Alabama Baptist, included a front-page story that featured a Hispanic pastor's worries and criticism about the law.\par \par \uc2 New Census figures show Alabama's population of 4.8 million is about 4 percent Hispanic. The number of Hispanics living in the state grew about 145 percent in the last decade to about 185,600, statistics show.\par \par \uc2 Republican Gov. Robert Bentley, a deacon and Sunday school teacher at the First Baptist Church in Tuscaloosa, signed a law last week that makes it a crime to knowingly hire an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 ; rent them a place to live or transport them in a vehicle. Schools are required to determine the immigration status of their students and report it to the state, although children in the country illegally would not be refused an education.\par \par \uc2 Backers of the law have described it as being designed to both reduce the number of illegal immigrants in the state and to free up jobs for U.S. citizens that are now held by people living Alabama without proper documents. Bentley said he fulfilled a campaign promised by signing a law that both supporters and many opponents say surpassed Arizona's to become the toughest such law in the nation.\par \par \uc2 But some church leaders are criticizing the law as overly harsh and a direct contradiction to Christian teachings. The United Methodist bishop for north Alabama, William H. Willimon, called it "an embarrassment to our state" that "does not represent the spirit of hospitality of our churches."\par \par \uc2 "While I'm confident that the bill will be overturned, I am proud that a number of our Methodists -- those committed to evangelism and mission -- are speaking up in the name of Christ to oppose this ill-conceived bill that does nothing to help our state and does great harm to our sisters and brothers," Willimon wrote in a message that was endorsed by his fellow bishop for south Alabama, Paul L. Leeland.\par \par \uc2 Both Roman Catholic bishops in Alabama said they stand behind criticism of the law they expressed while it was being considered by legislators. Lutheran Bishop H. Julian Gordy wrote Bentley criticizing the law, particularly the section that requires schools to check on students' immigration status.\par \par \uc2 "This provision would scare kids away from attending school and seems particularly mean-spirited," wrote Gordy, who oversees the Southeastern Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, which includes Alabama.\par \par \uc2 The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints -- the Mormons -- issued a statement saying it was worried about tough state immigration statutes the day after Bentley signed the law.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110616e76g002xe\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc29}{\*\bkmkend toc29}\b \uc2 Spanish-language TV news expanding as 2012 election nears, politicians taking notice\b0\par\par\uc2 By LAURA WIDES-MUNOZ   \par \uc2 AP Hispanic Affairs Writer\par \uc2 1,211 \uc2 words\par \uc2 16 June 2011\par 15:16\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2011.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 MIAMI (AP) - Spanish-language television news is meeting a surge in Hispanic voting muscle and viewership with greatly expanded domestic coverage this year, just in time for the 2012 election season.\par \par \uc2 Industry experts say the growth could affect next year's election by increasing awareness of political issues among U.S. Spanish speakers and by encouraging more to vote in a population whose participation has lagged others. Members of bilingual households who prefer English are also expected to be influenced by the newscasts when they watch with parents and grandparents. The change comes as the latest Census data shows Hispanics propelled more than half of the country's population growth over the last decade.\par \par \uc2 "It's a cycle. You have a growing population that leads to more coverage, which forces more politicians to pay attention, and that leads to better, and more, news coverage and more engagement," said Alejandro Alvarado, head of Florida International University's Spanish-language Master's in Journalism program.\par \par \uc2 The nation's three top Spanish-language broadcast and cable networks are beefing up their election coverage and increasing get-out-the vote efforts. Of the nation's more than 20 million Hispanic citizens over 18, nearly half are bilingual and about a quarter are more comfortable in Spanish. Meanwhile, less than a third said they voted in 2010, according to Census data analyzed by the independent Pew Hispanic Center. Comparatively, nearly half of their white counterparts said they voted.\par \par \uc2 Still, the Pew study showed a record number of Hispanics voted in a non-presidential year, boosting their share of votes and showing their increasing political power. Latino turnout could be key in 2012 swing states like Florida, New Mexico, Nevada and Colorado.\par \par \uc2 Univision recently announced it plans to start a 24-hour cable news channel in 2012, along with several local newscasts. It's also created an investigative team and a news documentary division, while hiring reporters to cover the drug war, health care, Wall Street and the White House.\par \par \uc2 Its primary rival, NBC Universal's Telemundo says its local affiliates are adding 1,000 hours of local news content a year, as well as several all-news digital channels in key markets.\par \par \uc2 Univision and Telemundo's nightly newscasts, whose audiences are growing, drew a combined average of about 2.5 million viewers nightly last year according to \uc2 Nielsen Co\uc2 . That's small compared to the 23 million combined for the big three English-language network newscasts, but it's also a higher proportion of Hispanic households than the big three capture of the general audience.\par \par \uc2 On cable, CNN en Espanol, which has mostly catered to viewers in Latin America since its 1997 launch, revamped its domestic lineup last fall and added 14 reporters and anchors, several shows and a Miami studio.\par \par \uc2 Recognizing that many Latinos get their news from their mobile devices, all three networks are beefing up their online news departments.\par \par \uc2 Telemundo and Univision still fend off criticism for scantily clad women and violence in their non-news programming, but politicians are responding to the enhanced news coverage.\par \par \uc2 Univision, CNN en Espanol and Telemundo's weekend public affairs programs now regularly draw top leaders. Topics range from immigration to the disproportionate number of uninsured Hispanics. Earlier this year when President Barack Obama held a town hall on education, Univision was chosen for the first time as the network to air it.\par \par \uc2 It's not just about the big networks. In heavily Latino markets such as Miami and Los Angeles, independent local channels increasingly draw politicians and community leaders to their news talk shows.\par \par \uc2 For Nina Ocon, a 23-year-old public relations major at Florida International University, watching Spanish-language TV is partly about seeing news subjects who look and sound like her.\par \par \uc2 "In English, too often the Hispanic being interviewed is still the housekeeper," she said.\par \par \uc2 Although she mostly gets her news online in English, she watches local news in Spanish with her Nicaraguan mother and catches news about her stepfather's native Colombia from Latin American cable TV.\par \par \uc2 "I'll come and sit with them to watch the news. It's not so much a habit, it just happens," she said.\par \par \uc2 Spanish-language TV executives, and increasingly politicians and advertisers, are banking on attracting people like Ocon, who grew up on Spanish-language news but is now more comfortable in English.\par \par \uc2 Isaac Lee, the new head of Univision's news division, said the network is the choice of many bilingual viewers because they provide coverage through a Latino lens. He pointed to January's shooting of Arizona Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords as an example.\par \par \uc2 "The mainstream media focused on what happened to her. We covered that but focused on the fact that it was a Hispanic who saved her and what put him into a position to be able to do that," he said.\par \par \uc2 During the 2010 California governor debate sponsored by Univision, GOP candidate Meg Whitman was forced to defend her decision to fire her long-time \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  housekeeper after the woman turned to her for help with her legal status. The scandal had been brewing before the debate, but Univision's airing of Whitman's comments translated into Spanish helped solidify a shift among Hispanic voters to eventual victor and Democrat Jerry Brown, said Fernando Amandi, of the research and consulting firm Bendixen & Amandi, which focuses on the Hispanic market.\par \par \uc2 Most studies find that Hispanic voters rank jobs, health care and education above immigration as priorities. Yet Spanish-language news skews toward a viewership of newer arrivals who relate directly to the immigration story, which helps give the issue greater resonance in the broader Latino community.\par \par \uc2 Telemundo news Vice President Ramon Escobar, a former NBC news executive, is unapologetic about the emphasis on immigration. He acknowledges fixing the nation's current system is a complex task but describes the debate as "our generation's civil rights era."\par \par \uc2 Spanish-language newscasts have a responsibility to lead coverage on the treatment of immigrants, Escobar said. Telemundo anchors spent months in Phoenix around the time of Arizona's passage of its tough 2010 immigration law.\par \par \uc2 "Arizona was clearly a flashpoint in this country," he said Thursday during the annual conference of the National Association of Hispanic Journalists in central Florida. "And we were there from the beginning."\par \par \uc2 Escobar said the network plans add similar coverage in states that recently passed tough immigration laws like Utah, Georgia and Alabama.\par \par \uc2 As they expand, executives also face the growing challenge of holding onto second- and third- generation Hispanics who speak little or no Spanish. Language barriers are already beginning to break down as reporters do double-duty for CNN in English and Spanish and for NBC and Telemundo. Univision's news division now tweets in English.\par \par \uc2 Univision just created a graduate journalism fellowship at Columbia University in New York, while Telemundo created a journalism internship for Florida International students in Miami.\par \par \uc2 "Our emphasis is to have students be bilingual," Florida International's Alvarado said. "It's becoming a two-way conversation, with more journalists hopping back and forth -- just like Hispanics do throughout the country."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110616e76g001eq\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) - More than two dozen members of a Raleigh church are facing deportation after a traffic stop in Louisiana based on what their supporters say was illegal racial profiling rather than reasonable suspicion.\par \par \uc2 Members of the Buen Pastor church and their supporters are planning a vigil in Raleigh Thursday night, on the same day that the Southern Coalition for Social Justice is planning to file a federal civil rights complaint in the case.\par \par \uc2 The group, which is representing 22 of 24 accused \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  members of the church in Charlotte Immigration Court, contends that the proceedings should be thrown out because the April 2010 traffic stop that led to them was illegally conducted from the moment federal Customs and Border Protection agents pulled three vans over late at night outside Lake Charles.\par \par \uc2 "Where they were stopped is about 500 miles from the international border," said Elizabeth Simpson, the coalition lawyer taking the church members' case. "The agents couldn't possibly have had reasonable suspicion to pull them over lawfully."\par \par \uc2 The government says 24 members of the church are illegal immigrants. Simpson, the attorney for 22 of the 24, disputes that accusation without specifying the church members' immigration status, saying the government's claim hasn't been proved.\par \par \uc2 The two church members who aren't being represented by the group have other lawyers.\par \par \uc2 Simpson has filed a motion in immigration court to have the case thrown out. Among her arguments is that the federal agency's field manual requires three conditions for a lawful extended border search, including "reasonable certainty that the vehicle/person crossed the border," which Simpson contends is impossible given the distance of Lake Charles from the U.S. border with Mexico.\par \par \uc2 The federal government has opposed the motion, and the next court date is scheduled for Sept. 22. A U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokeswoman in New Orleans declined to comment, saying the case is still an ongoing investigation.\par \par \uc2 The church members and their supporters contend they were pulled over simply because they're Latino, and that after being detained they were subjected to ridicule by federal agents. The group also says its members were denied their legal rights to make phone calls or contact lawyers during detention.\par \par \uc2 "They just said we were suspicious, that we were suspicious people," said Jeremias Villar, one of the church members contesting the deportation order.\par \par \uc2 The incident occurred early in the morning of April 15, 2010, when three vans and several private vehicles from Buen Pastor were returning to North Carolina from a religious ceremony in Houston. Buen Pastor, an Evangelical Protestant church, regards the "Santa Cena," or holy supper, as the most important religious event of the year.\par \par \uc2 In a complaint expected to be filed with the Department of Homeland Security's Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties Thursday, members of the church group say they were mocked and derided by customs agents, who ridiculed everything from their religious beliefs to their distinctive dress, which includes veils for women.\par \par \uc2 "They were also subject to insults based on their ethnicity, and the congregants perceived that they had been targeted based on Latino appearance, in part because the vans were traveling at a normal speed and there was no reason for them to be pulled over," reads a draft copy of the complaint obtained by The Associated Press.\par \par \uc2 Supporters of the church members are planning to hold a candlelight vigil on their behalf Thursday night at Pullen Memorial Baptist Church in Raleigh, a congregation that's long been active in civil rights causes.\par \par \uc2 "We are a bit worried, like we've lost some hope, but we're with the church and praying together," Villar said.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110616e76g00196\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - The Department of Homeland Security's Immigration and Customs Enforcement is taking the lead of an investigation into two fatal worker accidents at a Knoxville bridge project to determine whether the contractor knowingly hired illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 According to state documents obtained by The Knoxville News Sentinel, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  had a role in the first fatal accident in January at the Henley Bridge reconstruction project and the victim in the second accident in May may have been working illegally.\par \par \uc2 Contractor Britton Bridge LLC was ordered to halt all work on the Henley Bridge and other projects after the second fatality so that safety reviews could be completed. Last week, the state gave the company the green light to resume work and officials said that safety coordinators with the state Department of Transportation will regularly visit the contractor's projects to monitor safety.\par \par \uc2 According to a June 10 memo from state Labor Commissioner Karla Davis, the state would work with ICE, but the federal agency would take the lead. "They have subpoenaed the work records of Britton Bridge," Davis said in the memo to Transportation Commissioner John Schroer.\par \par \uc2 The memo states that Solin Estrada-Jiminez, who was killed May 24 by a piece of falling concrete, "might have been an unauthorized worker and/or \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 ." Estrada-Jiminez's brother told the newspaper in an interview after he died that the 47-year-old was in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 Britton Bridge spokesman John Van Mol said the company has a policy of hiring only U.S. citizens or immigrants with proper documents, but may have been duped by fake documents. Van Mol said the man identified as Estrada-Jiminez was hired under the name Rodolfo Bustillos.\par \par \uc2 "The credentials and papers he presented appeared to be legitimate and in order, and that is the basis on which he was hired," Van Mol said.\par \par \uc2 Another worker, John Womac, 33, was fatally injured on Jan. 25 when he was struck in the head by a bucket and arm of a track hoe. Davis said in her memo that an investigation determined that the man operating the track hoe "was an unauthorized worker and/or \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 " and was arrested by ICE agents.\par \par \uc2 TDOT requires companies getting state contracts to sign a pledge saying they will not hire illegal workers, but Lyndsay Botts, a department spokeswoman, said they can't investigate.\par \par \uc2 A safety review by the Tennessee Occupational Safety and Health Administration prompted by the first death led to proposed fines of $16,750 for various violations. Britton Bridge is appealing the fines.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Information from: The Knoxville News Sentinel, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.knoxnews.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.knoxnews.com}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110614e76e001z9\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) - A Belle Chasse legislator has withdrawn a bill that would mount a wide-ranging attack on illegal immigration after questions arose about the cost of enforcing it.\par \par \uc2 Independent Rep. Ernest Wooton says his bill would help secure the borders by prompting federal officials to better enforce immigration restrictions.\par \par \uc2 "I don't want to line (illegal immigrants) up and send them home," Wooton said in a hearing Monday by the House Appropriations Committee. But he added, "I would love to see some of these federal laws enforced."\par \par \uc2 Critics say his measure's $11 million estimated cost would strain state and local governments and lead to racial profiling.\par \par \uc2 Before hearing public testimony Monday, Wooton volunteered to defer the bill, scrapping the proposal for the current legislative session. He said he offered the motion at the request of committee Chairman Jim Fannin, D-Jonesboro.\par \par \uc2 "This $11 million just so happened to not be in the budget when it left here," said Fannin.\par \par \uc2 Wooton's measure would have created a series of new state crimes, such as a ban on illegal immigrants seeking work, and impose new requirements on certain employers, state officials and police officers.\par \par \uc2 The bill would make it a crime to harbor, conceal, shelter, transport or hire immigrants. It would establish crimes for illegal immigrants seeking work and for willfully failing to carry a registration document. And it would make it a crime for anyone -- including public employees -- to fail to report fraud that is committed in order to obtain public assistance.\par \par \uc2 The Louisiana Workforce Commission would be charged with investigating any violations of the new crimes.\par \par \uc2 Like a new Arizona law, now being challenged in the courts, Wooton's bill would also require officers to make a judgment call on whether "reasonable suspicion exists that the person stopped is an alien and is unlawfully present in the United States." Critics say that provision would lead to racial profiling.\par \par \uc2 Wooton said the $11 million cost of his bill isn't that high, compared to the $24 billion annual cost of running the state government.\par \par \uc2 He noted that Alabama on June 9 enacted a law that mirrors the Arizona legislation.\par \par \uc2 Similar to Wooton's bill, the Alabama law requires police to make judgment calls in the field about whether they suspect someone of being an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . In addition, it requires businesses to check the legal status of workers and makes it a crime to knowingly transport or shelter illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 But the Alabama law goes beyond Wooton's bill by requiring schools to report the immigration status of students.\par \par \uc2 "Alabama saw fit to buck the federal laws, to say `We're tired of these laws not being enforced,'" said Wooton.\par \par \uc2 Just weeks ago, Rep. Joe Harrison, R-Napoleonville, deferred his own controversial immigration proposal. Both Harrison and Wooton's bills faced opposition from Catholics, police officers and immigrant rights advocates.\par \par \uc2 Similar to Wooton's bill, Harrison's would have required law enforcement officers to keep anyone they book in jail until their citizenship status can be verified.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Online:\par \par \uc2 House Bill 411 can be found at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.legis.state.la.us"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.legis.state.la.us}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110613e76d00348\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) - A budget conference committee on Monday nixed plans to give large day care centers a one-year reprieve from state inspections and to move some \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  inmates into federal hands\par \par \uc2 Negotiations between three House and three Senate members came as the conference committee continues works on a compromise version of the state's $6 billion spending plan for the fiscal year that begins July 1. Legislators return to Columbia for a wrap-up session to deal with that unfinished business as well as redrawing election district lines for the Statehouse and U.S. House.\par \par \uc2 The House had included a plan in its version of the proposed budget that would have extended the state's current two-year licenses for day cares to a third year.\par \par \uc2 Operators and supporters said the measure would cut the hassle of license renewals with the Department of Social Services. The agency said it would continue to do unannounced inspections twice a year.\par \par \uc2 Other inspections tied to renewing a license will come only every three years. For instance, the Department of Health and Environmental Control will move to a three-year food safety inspection instead of making those routine checks when licenses are renewed every two.\par \par \uc2 The committee also rejected a proposal that would have turned some illegal immigrants in the state's prisons over to federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials.\par \par \uc2 The Corrections Department would have to have a deportation order and the prisoner would need to complete at least a third of the sentence. They couldn't be sent to immigration authorities if they were convicted of serious crimes, including criminal sexual conduct, armed robbery, drug trafficking or felony DUI. And if they returned illegally to the U.S., the release would be revoked and prisoners would have to serve out the remainder of the sentence with no parole.\par \par \uc2 The panel was working through dozens of policy issues like those that are part of the budget before turning to major differences in spending plans.\par \par \uc2 The biggest challenge for the panel is splitting $210 million between schools and a business tax break. The Senate had split the cash nearly evenly, with $105 million going to per-student spending and $100 million into a bailout for businesses complaining about higher unemployment taxes. The House increased the business tax break by $46 million and cut the school spending.\par \par \uc2 But there are dozens of smaller issues that will affect health care and law enforcement.\par \par \uc2 The Senate's version of spending on health care provides services for children and adults that weren't in the House's version, including:\par \par \uc2 -- $6 million for local health departments.\par \par \uc2 -- $5 million for AIDS treatment drugs.\par \par \uc2 -- $4.2 million for vaccines for underinsured children.\par \par \uc2 -- $2.8 million to for infectious disease prevention.\par \par \uc2 -- $2 million for cancer screening.\par \par \uc2 -- $1 million for crisis stabilization of mental health patients.\par \par \uc2 The Senate paid for most of those programs with regular tax collections, while about $8.6 million came from plans to crack down on out-of-state businesses who haven't paid state taxes.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, the Senate's tax collection plan also added nearly $7 million to the Corrections Department to manage youthful offenders, $5.3 million for Highway Patrol overtime and enforcing the state's illegal immigration law, and $2 million to the State Law Enforcement Division's budget to upgrade DUI test gear. The House's budget doesn't pay for those.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110613e76d001kg\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - An American-born high school student from New Jersey has been denied state tuition assistance because her mother is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , according to the American Civil Liberties Union.\par \par \uc2 The ACLU and a Rutgers University legal clinic are representing the high school senior -- identified only as A.Z. -- in an appeal filed on her behalf in a case they claim violates both state and federal laws.\par \par \uc2 The 17-year-old, who has lived in New Jersey for at least a decade and is a graduating senior, applied for a Tuition Aid Grant from the state's Higher Education Student Assistance Authority, or HESAA. Her state aid application was rejected, according to the ACLU, with the explanation that "her parents are not legal New Jersey residents."\par \par \uc2 HESAA representative Marnie Grodman, the acting director of legal matters for the agency, said she could not comment on active litigation or specific student cases. She said the agency requires students -- or if they are not yet legally adults, their parents -- to prove they have been domiciled in New Jersey for a period of at least a year immediately before the academic period for which they are requesting aid.\par \par \uc2 Alexander Shalom, policy counsel for the ACLU's New Jersey chapter, said what appears to be at issue in this case -- and similar rejections he's seen in recent months -- is HESAA's definition of "domiciled."\par \par \uc2 "HESAA is apparently taking the position that to be domiciled in New Jersey, you must be a legal (U.S.) resident, which is contrary to established New Jersey Supreme Court precedent," he said.\par \par \uc2 Ronald K. Chen of the Rutgers Constitutional Litigation Clinic said immigration and legal advocacy groups have seen an uptick in New Jersey of students who are U.S. citizens born to illegal immigrants getting rejected for tuition aid.\par \par \uc2 "As far as we can tell, it's not an isolated incident or a bureaucratic mistake; it's clearly a policy decision HESAA has decided to take," Chen said. "We respectfully think it's not lawful to discriminate against a U.S. citizen because of their parent's status."\par \par \uc2 Grodman said HESAA had not changed its policies or reinterpreted its regulations.\par \par \uc2 Chen said the student at the center of the case was a hardworking senior at the top her class. Both Chen and the ACLU declined to give her hometown or her mother's nationality, saying they wished to protect the family's identity.\par \par \uc2 The ACLU's appeal, filed Thursday with the Appellate Division of New Jersey Superior Court, argues that the immigration status of an applicant's parents is not listed as a determining factor in the legislation that created the aid program. They claim the denial violates equal protection laws.\par \par \uc2 Access to education for the American-born children of immigrants -- or for illegal immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children -- has been the subject of fierce debate in New Jersey and at the federal and local level nationwide.\par \par \uc2 Much of the debate has focused on whether \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students should be allowed to enroll in higher education or pay in-state tuition rates.\par \par \uc2 Opponents say allowing illegal immigrants to enroll in college takes seats away from legal residents, usurps scarce taxpayer-funded resources and encourages illegal immigration. Supporters of granting in-state tuition rates to illegal immigrants say those who are brought to the United States as children and grow up in the local school system are faced with few options after graduating high school -- regardless of how hard they work.\par \par \uc2 Several of New Jersey's community colleges, and some private colleges, currently allow illegal immigrants to enroll or don't ask for immigration status on school applications. The County College of Morris, after pressure from the freeholder board and members of the public, recently reversed part of a new policy that allowed illegal immigrants who met certain criteria to enroll at in-county rates.\par \par \uc2 State legislation that would have allowed \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students who grow up in New Jersey to pay in-state tuition failed to garner enough support for a vote.\par \par \uc2 In the current case, both Chen and Shalom emphasized that their client is a legal resident, born in the United States, who meets the criteria for state tuition aid.\par \par \uc2 Even if the HESAA application were to demand the immigration status of the parents as a prerequisite, Shalom said, it would be superseded by federal and state constitutions that forbid discrimination against U.S. citizens because of a parent's status.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Follow Samantha Henry at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.twitter.com/SamanthaHenry"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.twitter.com/SamanthaHenry}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110610e76a003mw\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) - Alabama schools Superintendent Joe Morton says his staff is developing guidelines to share with local principals and teachers on what they need to do to comply with a tough new law cracking down on illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 A bill passed by the Legislature and signed into law by Bentley Thursday includes language requiring schools to report the immigration status of students. Morton said Friday that state schools would comply with the provisions of the new law.\par \par \uc2 "I think I have built my career around following the law and we will follow this one," Morton said. He said the new law requires him to interpret the requirements of the statute before the new law takes effect Sept. 1.\par \par \uc2 Morton said he has been receiving questions from superintendents, teachers, principals and others concerning the provisions of the immigration law.\par \par \uc2 "These are the normal questions you receive when there are changes in the law and in procedures. We have assured them we would give them guidance in plenty of time.\par \par \uc2 Morton said school officials will have some time to react to the new law because it doesn't take effect until Sept. 1, several weeks after most Alabama schools start the new school year. Because the law requires the reporting when students are enrolled at the beginning of the year, schools will have almost a year before they have to file the reports for most students.\par \par \uc2 The president of the Jefferson County chapter of the American Federation of Teachers, Vi Parramore, complained the new law turns educators into "immigration enforcement officials."\par \par \uc2 Isabel Rubio, executive director of The Hispanic Interest Coalition of Alabama, said the new law shifts the focus of schools away from their responsibility of educating children.\par \par \uc2 "Schools are there to educate people, not to police people," Rubio said.\par \par \uc2 The House sponsor of the bill, Republican Rep. Micky Hammon of Decatur, said the reporting requirement is for informational purposes only and is not to be used against students or their parents.\par \par \uc2 But critics argued that by gathering the information, parents would be discouraged from sending the children to school because they would be worried that their illegal immigration status would be revealed.\par \par \uc2 The sweeping law allows police to arrest anyone suspected of being an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  if the person is stopped for some other reason. In addition, it requires all businesses to check the legal status of workers using a federal system called E-Verify and makes it a crime to knowingly transport or shelter illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Rubio's organization helps immigrants in Alabama learn English, work to become citizens and helps them with domestic violence and other issues that often face new residents in the country.\par \par \uc2 "This bill effectively criminalizes our work, in terms of harboring. This bill is aimed at anybody who helps the immigrant community. It puts us at risk of breaking the law," Rubio said.\par \par \uc2 Brian Wallace, director of public relations for the Salvation Army in Birmingham said the religious-based organization accepts "anybody without discrimination" at its facilities. But he said he doesn't believe the Salvation Army will have trouble with the new law. He said anybody can enter Salvation Army facilities, but people must show identification to spent the night in a shelter.\par \par \uc2 "It's too early to tell if we are going to need to change anything," Wallace said.\par \par \uc2 Bentley said Friday he signed the bill without making any changes to it because "I support what we passed."\par \par \uc2 A legal immigrant from Mexico, Julian Perez said he believes the new law will cause Hispanic immigrants to leave the state.\par \par \uc2 "People are going to get out of this state," said Perez, a cement contractor in Birmingham who has been in the country for four years. He said he has a work visa.\par \par \uc2 "People will look for another state to work in," Perez said.\par \par \uc2 Perez said he believes the new law is racist and he worries about young people who are coming to Alabama from Mexico and other Latin American countries to make a living.\par \par \uc2 The law pursues people who are just here trying to do good," Perez said.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110610e76a003h0\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - An American-born high school student from New Jersey has been denied state tuition assistance because her mother is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , according to the American Civil Liberties Union.\par \par \uc2 The ACLU and a Rutgers University legal clinic are representing the high school senior -- identified only as A.Z. -- in an appeal filed on her behalf in a case they claim violates both state and federal laws.\par \par \uc2 The 17-year-old, who has lived in New Jersey for at least a decade and is a graduating senior, applied for a Tuition Aid Grant from the state's Higher Education Student Assistance Authority, or HESAA. Her state aid application was rejected, according to the ACLU, with the explanation that "her parents are not legal New Jersey residents."\par \par \uc2 HESAA representative Marnie Grodman, the acting director of legal matters for the agency, said she could not comment on active litigation or specific student cases. She requested that any further inquiries be sent by email, and a message seeking details on HESAA's policy on the immigration status of an applicant's family members, and the number of similar cases the agency has rejected, was not immediately returned.\par \par \uc2 Ronald K. Chen of the Rutgers Constitutional Litigation Clinic said immigration and legal advocacy groups have been seeing similar cases in recent months in New Jersey, amid a contentious debate over student tuition eligibility as it relates to immigrants or their children.\par \par \uc2 "As far as we can tell, it's not an isolated incident or a bureaucratic mistake; it's clearly a policy decision HESAA has decided to take," Chen said. "We respectfully think it's not lawful to discriminate against a U.S. citizen because of their parent's status."\par \par \uc2 Chen said the student at the center of the case was a hardworking senior at the top her class. Both Chen and the ACLU declined to give her hometown or her mother's nationality, saying they wished to protect the family's identity.\par \par \uc2 The appeal, filed Thursday with the Appellate Division of New Jersey Superior Court, argues that the immigration status of an applicant's parents is not listed as a determining factor in the legislation that created the aid program. They claim the denial violates equal protection laws.\par \par \uc2 Access to education for the American-born children of immigrants, or for immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children by parents who immigrated illegally, has been under discussion in New Jersey, and the subject of ongoing debate at the federal and local level across the U.S.\par \par \uc2 Although the ACLU case centers around a student who was born and raised in the United States, much of the debate in New Jersey and elsewhere has focused on whether \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students should be allowed to enroll in higher education or pay in-state tuition rates.\par \par \uc2 Opponents say allowing illegal immigrants to enroll in college takes seats away from legal residents, usurps scarce taxpayer-funded resources and encourages illegal immigration. Supporters of granting in-state tuition rates to illegal immigrants say those who are brought to the United States as children and grow up in the local school system are faced with few options after graduating high school -- regardless of how hard they work.\par \par \uc2 Several of New Jersey's community colleges, and some private colleges, currently allow illegal immigrants to enroll or don't ask for immigration status on school applications. The County College of Morris, after pressure from the freeholder board and members of the public, recently reversed part of a new policy that allowed illegal immigrants who met certain criteria to enroll at in-county rates.\par \par \uc2 State legislation that would have allowed \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students who grow up in New Jersey to pay in-state tuition failed to garner enough support for a vote.\par \par \uc2 In the current case, both Chen and Alexander Shalom, policy counsel for the ACLU's New Jersey chapter, emphasized that their client is a legal resident, born in the United States, who meets the criteria for state tuition aid.\par \par \uc2 Even if the HESAA application were to demand the immigration status of the parents as a prerequisite, Shalom said, it would be superseded by federal and state constitutions that forbid discrimination against U.S. citizens because of a parent's status.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Follow Samantha Henry at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.twitter.com/SamanthaHenry"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.twitter.com/SamanthaHenry}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110610e76a002vv\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) - Alabama schools will soon have to check if students are in the country legally and people stopped for any reason could be arrested on suspicion of immigration violations under a sweeping law being called the nation's most restrictive against illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 Advocacy groups promised to challenge the sweeping measure signed by Gov. Robert Bentley on Thursday, which they call even more severe than the one in Arizona that is being challenged in court.\par \par \uc2 In addition, it requires all businesses to check the legal status of workers using a federal system called E-Verify and makes it a crime to knowingly give an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  a ride.\par \par \uc2 "It is clearly unconstitutional. It's mean-spirited, racist, and we think a court will enjoin it," said Mary Bauer, legal director for the Southern Poverty Law Center.\par \par \uc2 It takes effect Sept. 1.\par \par \uc2 Bentley expressed confidence it would withstand any legal challenges.\par \par \uc2 "We have a real problem with illegal immigration in this country," he said. "I campaigned for the toughest immigration laws, and I'm proud of the Legislature for working tirelessly to create the strongest immigration bill in the country."\par \par \uc2 Alabama has an estimated 120,000 illegal immigrants, a nearly fivefold increase from a decade ago, according to the Pew Hispanic Center. Many of them are believed to be working on farms, at chicken processing plants and in construction.\par \par \uc2 One of the legislation's sponsors, GOP Sen. Scott Beason, said it would help the unemployed by preventing illegal immigrants from getting jobs in the state. Alabama's unemployment rate stood at 9.3 percent in April, the most recent figure available.\par \par \uc2 "This will put thousands of Alabamians back in the work force," Beason said.\par \par \uc2 The Alabama Business Council has not taken a public stand on the law. In neighboring Georgia, some farmers and business owners warned that a crackdown passed recently in that state would make it more difficult to hire the laborers they rely on -- many of whom are illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 The Alabama measure instantly puts the state at the forefront of the immigration debate. Organizations such as the American Civil Liberties Union and the Southern Poverty Law Center agreed that it is the nation's toughest crackdown on illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 Linton Joaquin, general counsel for the National Immigration Law Center in Los Angeles, said the Alabama law covers all aspects of an immigrant's life.\par \par \uc2 "It is a sweeping attack on immigrants and people of color in general. It adds restrictions on education, housing and other areas.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) - Alabama vaulted past Arizona on Thursday with what is being called the most restrictive law in the nation against illegal immigration, requiring schools to find out if students are in the country lawfully and making it a crime to knowingly give an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  a ride.\par \par \uc2 Advocacy groups promised to challenge the sweeping measure, which like Arizona's law also allows police to arrest anyone suspected of being an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  if the person is stopped for some other reason. In addition, it requires all businesses to check the legal status of workers using a federal system called E-Verify.\par \par \uc2 "It is clearly unconstitutional. It's mean-spirited, racist, and we think a court will enjoin it," said Mary Bauer, legal director for the Southern Poverty Law Center.\par \par \uc2 It takes effect Sept. 1.\par \par \uc2 Republican Gov. Robert Bentley, who signed it into law Thursday, expressed confidence it would withstand any legal challenges.\par \par \uc2 "We have a real problem with illegal immigration in this country," he said. "I campaigned for the toughest immigration laws, and I'm proud of the Legislature for working tirelessly to create the strongest immigration bill in the country."\par \par \uc2 Alabama has an estimated 120,000 illegal immigrants, a nearly fivefold increase from a decade ago, according to the Pew Hispanic Center. Many of them are believed to be working on farms, at chicken processing plants and in construction.\par \par \uc2 One of the legislation's sponsors, GOP Sen. Scott Beason, said it would help the unemployed by preventing illegal immigrants from getting jobs in the state. Alabama's unemployment rate stood at 9.3 percent in April, the most recent figure available.\par \par \uc2 "This will put thousands of Alabamians back in the work force," Beason said.\par \par \uc2 The Alabama Business Council has not taken a public stand on the law. In neighboring Georgia, some farmers and business owners warned that a crackdown passed recently in that state would make it more difficult to hire the laborers they rely on -- many of whom are illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 The Alabama measure instantly puts the state at the forefront of the immigration debate. Organizations such as the American Civil Liberties Union and the Southern Poverty Law Center agreed that it is the nation's toughest crackdown on illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 Linton Joaquin, general counsel for the National Immigration Law Center in Los Angeles, said the Alabama law covers all aspects of an immigrant's life.\par \par \uc2 "It is a sweeping attack on immigrants and people of color in general. It adds restrictions on education, housing and other areas. It is a very broad attack," Joaquin said.\par \par \uc2 Among other things, the law makes it a crime for landlords to knowingly rent to an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Another provision makes it a crime to transport a known \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . Arizona's law appears narrower: It includes language against human smuggling and makes it illegal to pick up laborers for work if doing so impedes traffic.\par \par \uc2 Alabama's law also goes further in requiring schools to check the immigration status of their students. The measure does not prohibit illegal immigrants from attending public schools; lawmakers said the purpose instead is to gather data on how many are enrolled and how the much the state is spending to educate them.\par \par \uc2 Jared Shepherd, an attorney for the ACLU, warned that because of that provision, some immigrant parents may not send their children to school for fear of arrest or deportation.\par \par \uc2 Activists such as Shay Farley, legal director of Alabama Appleseed, an immigrant advocacy group, said the bill invites racial profiling not only by law enforcement officers but by landlords and employers.\par \par \uc2 "It's going to make us profile our neighbors and our church brothers and sisters," Farley said.\par \par \uc2 Alabama's Hispanic population more than doubled between 2000 and 2010 to 186,000, or 3.9 percent of the state's nearly 4.8 million people, according to the Census.\par \par \uc2 Some farmers and other small businesses had hoped to be exempted from having to verify the immigration status of employees, fearing the database would be too costly and add too much red tape. Georgia's law, by contrast, exempts businesses with fewer than 10 employees.\par \par \uc2 Alabama's measure was modeled on Arizona's. A federal judge blocked the most controversial parts of Arizona's law last year after the Justice Department sued.\par \par \uc2 That includes the provision that required police to check people's immigration status while enforcing other laws if there was reason to believe the person was in the country illegally. The case appears headed for the U.S. Supreme Court.\par \par \uc2 A less restrictive law in Utah also was blocked after a lawsuit was filed.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Gingrich chaos: Campaign manager and senior aides resign; he vows to remain in Republican race\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) -- The entire top echelon of Newt Gingrich's presidential campaign resigned on Thursday, a stunning mass exodus that left his bid for the Republican nomination in tatters. But the former House speaker vowed defiantly to remain a candidate.\par \par \uc2 "I am committed to running the substantive, solutions-oriented campaign I set out to run earlier this spring," the Gingrich said in a posting to his \uc2 Facebook\uc2  page. "The campaign begins anew Sunday in Los Angeles."\par \par \uc2 Rick Tyler, Gingrich's spokesman, said that he, campaign manager Rob Johnson and senior strategists had all quit, along with aides in the early primary and caucus states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina.\par \par \uc2 Other officials said Gingrich was informed that his entire high command was quitting in a meeting at his headquarters in Washington. They cited differences over the direction of the campaign.\par \par \uc2 "We had a different vision for victory," Tyler told The Associated Press. "And since we couldn't resolve that difference, I didn't feel I could be useful in serving him."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Top Democratic women irked but dodge tough call on whether Weiner should resign\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pursed lips. Frosty glares. Polite demurrals. Icy silence. Women in politics are grappling with the distinctly unfunny choice of restraining themselves or letting rip what they really think about Rep. Anthony Weiner's X-rated online conduct and whether he belongs in Congress.\par \par \uc2 They'll be vexed by the question awhile longer because the 46-year-old Democrat from New York City told the New York Post on Thursday he won't resign.\par \par \uc2 The scandal presents a maddening choice for these female leaders, none shy, between speaking out or keeping quiet about behavior that, at best, is disrespectful of women.\par \par \uc2 "You're right, I don't like" questions about Weiner, Sen. Dianne Feinstein said with a smile.\par \par \uc2 Feinstein, D-Calif., was elected in 1992, known as "the Year of the Woman." She said she's shocked and saddened by the matter, which grew worse as the week went on, and she wished she could say something lighthearted about it.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Unrelenting heat challenges Eastern half of US, complicates tornado recovery in Mass.\par \par \uc2 SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) -- A third day of unseasonable heat blistered the eastern half of the country Thursday, making tornado cleanup miserable in Massachusetts, sending country music fans in Tennessee to hospitals and leaving Special Olympians in Pennsylvania gulping gallons of water.\par \par \uc2 The persistent heat has been blamed for at least seven deaths from the Plains to the East Coast, where authorities prepared emergency rooms and encouraged neighbors to check on the elderly as temperatures soared above 100 in spots.\par \par \uc2 Some Northeastern schools canceled classes or closed early for a second day Thursday so students would not have to suffer with no air conditioning. Cooling centers opened in Chicago, Memphis, Tenn., Newark, N.J., and other cities as a refuge for those without air conditioning.\par \par \uc2 It hit at least 101 degrees in Newark, two degrees higher than the previous record set in 2008.\par \par \uc2 "I'd love to be indoors, but I don't make any money that way," said Jose Serrano, a landscape worker cutting lawns and trimming bushes in Toms River, N.J. "When it comes to working in these conditions, you just do what you have to do, you know?"\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Detroit's municipal power system has major failure, forcing city hall, courthouse evacuations\par \par \uc2 DETROIT (AP) -- Sections of downtown Detroit lost power Thursday afternoon after high demand for energy caused the city's municipal power system to have a major failure, city officials said.\par \par \uc2 The outage forced the evacuation of the Coleman Young Municipal Center, the McNamara federal building, the county courthouse, Cobo Center and some schools. The outages were spotty -- traffic lights were out in certain areas but working in other parts of the downtown district.\par \par \uc2 Mayoral spokeswoman Karen Dumas told The Associated Press she was at her desk typing an email when the blackout occurred at 2:30 p.m. Dumas said the outage was due to extreme power demand in the last few days for air conditioning and city officials had been warned a brownout could occur.\par \par \uc2 She said it could take at least 24 hours to fix the issue, though Detroit's Chief Operating Officer Chris Brown said he hopes it can be restored by Thursday night.\par \par \uc2 Brown said one of the five transmission lines from a power station on the city's southwest side went down Wednesday, and two more went down Thursday.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Alabama passes toughest illegal-immigration law in the US; advocacy groups threaten to sue\par \par \uc2 MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- Alabama vaulted past Arizona on Thursday with what is being called the most restrictive law in the nation against illegal immigration, requiring schools to find out if students are in the country lawfully and making it a crime to knowingly give an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  a ride.\par \par \uc2 Advocacy groups promised to challenge the sweeping measure, which like Arizona's law also allows police to arrest anyone suspected of being an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  if the person is stopped for some other reason. In addition, it requires all businesses to check the legal status of workers using a federal system called E-Verify.\par \par \uc2 "It is clearly unconstitutional. It's mean-spirited, racist, and we think a court will enjoin it," said Mary Bauer, legal director for the Southern Poverty Law Center.\par \par \uc2 It takes effect Sept. 1.\par \par \uc2 Republican Gov. Robert Bentley, who signed it into law Thursday, expressed confidence it would withstand any legal challenges.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Biden-led budget talks resume on Capitol Hill amid pressure to pick up the pace\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Joe Biden and GOP negotiators sparred over taxes Thursday in a closed-door meeting that exposed just how far apart they remain as the clock ticks on negotiations on a must-do measure to allow the government to resume borrowing more than $100 billion a month to pay its bills.\par \par \uc2 Both sides hope to pass the measure well before an early August deadline to avoid a first-ever, market-rattling default on U.S. obligations. It was the sixth meeting between Biden and a handful of top lawmakers. With the talks moving slowly, they agreed to pick up the pace with three meetings next week.\par \par \uc2 In the 2 1/2-hour meeting, Biden and Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner made a pitch for more revenue, but Republicans resolutely oppose anything that could be called a tax hike.\par \par \uc2 "Any balanced packaged has to end big loopholes like subsidies for the oil and gas industry," said Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., who's one of two House Democrats participating in the talks. But asked whether Republicans are showing any willingness to consider tax increases, Van Hollen said, "I can't say that would be true, no."\par \par \uc2 Last month, Biden told reporters: "I've made it clear ... revenues have to be in the deal."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Syrians fleeing across border tell of revolt, mutiny and mayhem; troops encircle restive town\par \par \uc2 GUVECCI, Turkey (AP) -- Syrian policemen turned their guns on each other, soldiers shed their uniforms rather than obey orders to fire on protesters, and three young men who tried to escape were beheaded by forces loyal to President Bashar Assad.\par \par \uc2 As more than 2,400 Syrians streamed across the open Turkish borders on Thursday ahead of tanks and troops who surrounded their hometown, they brought with them the first accounts of a week of revolt, mutiny and mayhem in Jisra al-Shughour. The streets were deserted, leaving no resistance against a regime equipped for all-out battle.\par \par \uc2 Even safe in Turkish camps 12 miles (20 kilometers) away, the Syrians said they feared the authoritarian government's reach and refused to allow their full names to be used.\par \par \uc2 A young man who identified himself as Rami said the Syrian reinforcements were mobilized in response to a mutiny among police and soldiers, sharply divided over how to disperse the protesters.\par \par \uc2 "It all started with the killing of two protesters a week ago, then policemen who refused orders from the Alawite police chief to fire on civilians clashed at the Emin Asqari police station," Rami said through an interpreter. Other Syrians nodded or interrupted with more details. Syria's ruling elite, including the Assads, belong to the minority Alawite sect.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Officials: Resort town protected overnight but still at risk from massive Ariz. wildfire\par \par \uc2 SPRINGERVILLE, Ariz. (AP) -- Fire crews working feverishly overnight managed to protect most of a mountain resort town threatened by a massive wildfire in eastern Arizona, but some homes were lost, officials said Thursday.\par \par \uc2 Fire information officer Suzanne Flory said overnight operations went well, particularly in the community of Greer, where the blaze had made a significant run Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 "Firefighters had a good stand and were able to protect the main part of town, but structures were lost," Flory said.\par \par \uc2 At least a half-dozen homes or cabins burned as the fire moved through the east side of Greer, said Jim Whittington, another fire spokesman.\par \par \uc2 On Thursday, crews remained in the picturesque valley protecting hundreds of homes, cabins and lodges.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Sinking prices taking a big bite out of home equity; average American now owns just 38 percent\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) -- Falling real estate prices are eating away at home equity. The percentage of their homes that Americans own is near its lowest point since World War II, the Federal Reserve said Thursday. The average homeowner now has 38 percent equity, down from 61 percent a decade ago.\par \par \uc2 The latest bleak snapshot of the housing market came as mortgage rates hit a new a low for the year, falling below 4.5 percent for a 30-year fixed loan. But even alluring rates have failed to deliver any lift to the depressed housing industry.\par \par \uc2 The Fed report is based on data from the first quarter of this year. Another report last week found that home prices in big cities have fallen to 2002 levels.\par \par \uc2 Normally, home equity rises as you pay off the mortgage. But home values have fallen dramatically since the bubble in prices burst in 2006. So many homeowners are losing equity even though the outstanding balance on the loan is getting smaller.\par \par \uc2 Nicole Rosen's home in tiny Spanaway, Wash., just outside the military base where her husband works, has lost $150,000 in value since she paid $275,000 for it in 2006. She has battled mortgage lenders in court for two years to stay out of foreclosure. In the meantime, the couple are paying off credit cards, figuring it's the only "positive thing we could do."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Anthony trial: Judge ends intense day of evidence early after Fla. mom takes ill\par \par \uc2 ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- The Florida mother accused of killing her 2-year-old daughter took ill Thursday, prompting the judge in her murder trial to recess court early and end the most intense day of evidence so far, which included jurors viewing pictures of the toddler's decomposed skull.\par \par \uc2 Judge Belvin Perry announced the news after sending the jury home for the day, asking them not to speculate about why court was ending early.\par \par \uc2 Casey Anthony cried, dabbed her eyes with a tissue and looked away as pictures of Caylee Anthony's remains were displayed in the courtroom Thursday morning. By afternoon, she looked to be getting progressively more emotional, keeping her head down to avoid seeing the pictures. At one point during a break she had to briefly step out of the courtroom.\par \par \uc2 She was returned to Orange County jail and treated by medical staff there.\par \par \uc2 Earlier in the day, a few jurors could be seen wiping their faces and others glanced away as photos were shown of the December 2008 discovery of the toddler's remains.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110609e769000yz\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) - Malaysia aims to launch a nationwide amnesty program in July to legalize up to 2 million illegal immigrants in the country, a senior government official said Thursday.\par \par \uc2 Home Ministry deputy secretary-general Raja Azahar Raja Abdul Manap said the move would help the government better manage the growing population of foreign workers, meet labor shortages in certain sectors, boost security and reduce human trafficking.\par \par \uc2 Malaysia has become a magnet for people from impoverished or war-torn places looking for work illegally or seeking a transit point to enter other nations, such as Australia. Authorities estimate at least 2 million foreigners, many from neighboring Indonesia, work in Malaysia illegally.\par \par \uc2 "The \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  population is growing rapidly and creating a lot of problems. Illegal workers are also depressing wages in the country. This amnesty exercise is part of the solution to manage our foreign workers," Raja Azahar told the Associated Press.\par \par \uc2 He said a Cabinet committee will meet later this month to finalize details, including the proposed July 1 launch date. The committee will also decide whether the foreigners will be allowed to stay on legally once they are registered. The committee could decide to require them to leave the country and then return to become legal workers, he said.\par \par \uc2 After the amnesty ends, authorities will launch a crackdown to sweep up any remaining illegal immigrants, Raja Azahar said. He said Malaysia held similar large-scale amnesty programs in 1996 and 2004.\par \par \uc2 Legal foreign workers make up 2 million of the country's work force of 12 million.\par \par \uc2 Malaysia wants to cut dependence on foreign labor but has been unable to fill tens of thousands of low-paying menial jobs shunned by locals in this relatively wealthy Southeast Asian nation.\par \par \uc2 Job opportunities have lured many illegal immigrants from poorer countries in the region, including Indonesia, Bangladesh and Myanmar. They work in palm oil plantations, factories, construction sites, restaurants and households.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110609e769000wi\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

But the former House speaker vowed defiantly to remain a candidate. "I am committed to running the substantive, solutions-oriented campaign I set out to run earlier this spring," the Gingrich said in a posting to his \uc2 Facebook\uc2  page. "The campaign begins anew Sunday in Los Angeles."\par \par \uc2 Top Democratic women dodge tough call on Weiner\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pursed lips. Frosty glares. Polite demurrals. Icy silence. Women in politics are grappling with the distinctly unfunny choice of restraining themselves or letting rip what they really think about Rep. Anthony Weiner's X-rated online conduct and whether he belongs in Congress. They'll be vexed by the question awhile longer because the 46-year-old Democrat from New York City told the New York Post on Thursday he won't resign.\par \par \uc2 US reaches plea deal in classified leaks case\par \par \uc2 BALTIMORE (AP) -- The Justice Department on Thursday reached a plea agreement in the leak case against a former National Security Agency official who allegedly passed classified documents to a newspaper reporter. In court papers, the government said Thomas Drake will plead guilty to exceeding authorized use of a computer, a misdemeanor.\par \par \uc2 Heat-related demand causes Detroit power outages\par \par \uc2 DETROIT (AP) -- Sections of downtown Detroit lost power Thursday after high demand from air conditioning during the previous days' 90-degree heat caused parts of the city's aging municipal power system to fail, knocking out electricity to about a half-dozen government buildings, officials said. The spotty outages forced hundreds of people to evacuate the Coleman Young Municipal Center, the McNamara federal building, the county courthouse, Cobo Center and some buildings at Wayne State University and a community college. Traffic lights were out in certain areas but working in other parts of the downtown district. The city's People Mover, an elevated train with a small route downtown, lacked power -- yet police headquarters was operating normally.\par \par \uc2 Jury clears Chicago businessman in Mumbai attacks\par \par \uc2 CHICAGO (AP) -- A federal jury convicted a Chicago businessman on Thursday of helping plot an attack against a Danish newspaper that printed cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad but cleared him of the most serious charge accusing him of cooperating in the deadly 2008 rampage in Mumbai. The jury reached its split verdict after two days of deliberations, finding Tahawwur Rana guilty of providing material support to terrorism in Denmark and to the Pakistani militant group that had claimed responsibility for the three-day siege in India's largest city that left more than 160 people dead, including six Americans.\par \par \uc2 Alabama passes tough illegal-immigration law\par \par \uc2 MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- Alabama vaulted past Arizona on Thursday with what is being called the most restrictive law in the nation against illegal immigration, requiring schools to find out if students are in the country lawfully and making it a crime to knowingly give an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  a ride. Advocacy groups promised to challenge the sweeping measure, which like Arizona's law also allows police to arrest anyone suspected of being an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  if the person is stopped for some other reason. In addition, it requires all businesses to check the legal status of workers using a federal system called E-Verify.\par \par \uc2 Alaska poised to release Sarah Palin's emails\par \par \uc2 JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) -- The state of Alaska on Friday will release thousands of Sarah Palin's emails from her first two years as governor, a disclosure that has taken on national prominence as she flirts with a run for the presidency. The emails were first requested during the 2008 White House race by citizens and news organizations, including The Associated Press, as they vetted a vice presidential nominee whose political experience included less than one term as governor of Alaska and a term as mayor of the small town of Wasilla. The nearly three-year delay has been attributed largely to the sheer volume of the release and the flood of requests.\par \par \uc2 Huge Arizona wildfire rekindles forest debate\par \par \uc2 SPRINGERVILLE, Ariz. (AP) -- A raging wildfire that could become the largest in Arizona history is rekindling the blame game surrounding ponderosa pine forests that have become dangerously overgrown after a century of fire suppression. Some critics put the responsibility on environmentalists for lawsuits that have cut back on logging. Others blame overzealous firefighters for altering the natural cycle of lightning-sparked fires that once cleared the forest floor.\par \par \uc2 Blagojevich's future again in hands of jurors\par \par \uc2 CHICAGO (AP) -- Rod Blagojevich's future was once again in the hands of jurors, after a day of fist thumping and tears during final arguments Thursday at the ousted Illinois governor's retrial on corruption charges. Jurors heard prosecutors describe Blagojevich as a schemer who lied to their faces on the witness stand about trying to sell or trade an appointment to President Barack Obama's vacated Senate seat and shaking down executives for campaign cash.\par \par \uc2 Yankees RHP Chamberlain has torn elbow ligament\par \par \uc2 NEW YORK (AP) -- Yankees reliever Joba Chamberlain has a torn ligament in his right elbow, a startling injury that's likely to require Tommy John surgery and end his season. A test Thursday morning revealed the tear. It came a day after New York put Chamberlain on the 15-day disabled list with a stiff elbow, the latest setback for the back of the Yankees' bullpen.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110609e7690000i\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) - An aggravated murder case against an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  was dropped because a judge ruled that a Spanish interpreter flubbed reading the man's his rights in a police interview, a newspaper reported Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 A prosecutor said that there wasn't enough evidence to go to trial after a Franklin County Common Pleas judge ruled last month to suppress the statements that Antonio M. Martinez-Nunez made in phone interviews with Reynoldsburg police, The Columbus Dispatch reported.\par \par \uc2 "His statements were the cornerstone of our case," said Assistant Prosecutor Mark Wodarcyk, who had moved to dismiss the charges.\par \par \uc2 Martinez-Nunez, 31, had been charged with nine counts, including aggravated murder and abuse of a corpse in the death of Armondo Casillas Castanedo, whose body was found in a parked car in the Columbus suburb of Reynoldsburg in August 2009. Police think Castanedo, a 36-year-old \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , was killed a few days earlier in a feud over drug territory. An autopsy determined that he was asphyxiated.\par \par \uc2 Martinez-Nunez was a suspect when he was arrested by the border patrol as he tried to re-enter the country illegally in Texas in February 2010, the newspaper reported. Reynoldsburg police conducted a phone interview with Martinez-Nunez from Texas with the help of a Spanish interpreter in Reynoldsburg, but a defense interpreter found that the first interpreter gave Martinez-Nunez incomplete Miranda warnings of his rights.\par \par \uc2 The police interpreter failed to tell Martinez-Nunez that he could end the interview at any time, and Martinez-Nunez also made several requests to talk with his consulate that were not acknowledged, defense attorney Brian Rigg told The Associated Press Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 Rigg also said that police and prosecutors were not aware of the translation problems until the second interpreter pointed them out.\par \par \uc2 Judge John P. Bessey, who ruled to suppress the statements, said Monday that Martinez-Nunez also didn't receive or sign a written waiver of his rights during the phone interview with police and did not orally waive his rights before making statements that showed "he had knowledge of the killing."\par \par \uc2 Martinez-Nunez did sign a waiver of his rights after he was returned to Ohio and gave police another interview.\par \par \uc2 "My concern was, when he got to Ohio, police were building on information that was illegally obtained during the phone interview," Bessey said.\par \par \uc2 Martinez-Nunez was in the Franklin County jail awaiting deportation, Rigg said.\par \par \uc2 He said the case illustrates that "the U.S. Constitution applies to everyone."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110607e767002vd\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

CALDWELL   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 1,359 \uc2 words\par \uc2 4 June 2011\par 11:09\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2011.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) - The agriculture industry fears a disaster is on the horizon if the one bit of new immigration policy that Congress seems to agree on becomes law.\par \par \uc2 A plan to require all American businesses to run their employees through E-Verify, a program that confirms each is legally entitled to work in the U.S., could wreak havoc on an industry where 80 percent of the field workers are illegal immigrants. So could the increased paperwork audits already under way by the Obama administration.\par \par \uc2 "We are headed toward a train wreck," said Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a California Democrat whose district includes agriculture-rich areas. "The stepped up (workplace) enforcement has brought this to a head."\par \par \uc2 Lofgren said farmers are worried that their work force is about to disappear. They say they want to hire legal workers and U.S. citizens, but that it's nearly impossible, given the relatively low wages and back-breaking work.\par \par \uc2 Wages can range from minimum wage to more than $20 an hour. But workers often are paid by the piece; the faster they work, they more they make. A steady income lasts only as long as the planting and harvesting seasons, which can be measured in weeks.\par \par \uc2 "Few citizens express interest, in large part because this is hard, tough work," Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsak said this past week. "Our broken immigration system offers little hope for producers to do the right thing."\par \par \uc2 Arturo S. Rodriguez, president of United Farm Workers, said migrant farm workers are exposed to blistering heat with little or no shade and few water breaks. It's skilled work, he said, requiring produce pickers to be exact and quick. While the best mushroom pickers can earn about $35,000 to $40,000 a year for piece work, there's little chance for a good living and American workers don't seem interested in farm jobs.\par \par \uc2 "It is extremely difficult, hard, dangerous work," Rodriguez said.\par \par \uc2 Last year Rodriguez's group started the "Take Our Jobs" campaign to entice American workers to take the fields. He said of about 86,000 inquiries the group got about the offer, only 11 workers took jobs.\par \par \uc2 "That really was thought up by farm workers trying to figure out what is it we needed to do to show that we are not trying to take away anyone's job," Rodriguez said.\par \par \uc2 Vilsak and the American Farm Bureau Federation president, Bob Stallman, said in a recent conference call with reporters that the best and likely only hope to stave off an economic catastrophe for American farmers and consumers is comprehensive overhaul of immigration policy. Vilsak said the industry is worth about $5 billion to $9 billion a year.\par \par \uc2 "We need to address the agriculture labor supply," Stallman said. "This situation will affect the future of America's farmers and ranchers."\par \par \uc2 Manuel Cunha, president of Nisei Farmers League, a group representing growers in central California, said farmers don't have the wherewithal to verify a worker's status when their labor force is often hired on the spot and in a hurry to pick ripe crops. Forcing them to verify a worker's legal status, he said, would prove disastrous.\par \par \uc2 "If we were to use E-Verify now, we'd shut down, either that or farmers would go to prison," said Cunha, a Fresno-based citrus farmer. "We've admitted many workers are not legal and if you have to get rid of everybody, where do I go to get my labor? Nowhere. We have to have a work force that we can put in the system."\par \par \uc2 Shawn Coburn, a politically active farmer who grows thousands of acres of almonds on the west side Fresno County, said he favors tighter borders, a guest worker program and a path to citizenship for those already in the U.S., or at the very least their children. But, like Cunha, he believes a mandatory E-Verify plan would be nothing but trouble for the industry.\par \par \uc2 "I don't think it's going to happen, but if it does it would throw the California economy for a loop," Coburn said.\par \par \uc2 Without a broad overhaul in the works, industry officials have focused on improving the H-2A temporary agricultural workers visa program that's aimed at allowing season workers to come and work on U.S. farms.\par \par \uc2 The program, however, is costly, time consuming and inefficient, according to Cathleen Enright, vice president of federal government affairs for the Western Growers Association.\par \par \uc2 "It has never been a great program or easy to work with," Enright said. "It's an unbelievably crushing program."\par \par \uc2 There isn't enough capacity in the system to process, interview and approve visa applications for the nearly 1 million seasonal workers who take to the fields every season. Farmers are required to pay for a worker's transportation from their home country to the fields, provide housing and other benefits.\par \par \uc2 Even minor violations of the numerous rules and regulations that govern the H-2A program can lead to hefty fines, Enright said.\par \par \uc2 "It's too expensive, it's too litigious, it's too bureaucratic," said Lee Wicker, deputy director of the North Carolina Growers Association. "We need a program that farmers can use and have confidence in."\par \par \uc2 Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., said farmers in his area want to do the right thing and hire legal workers but they are frustrated with the stifling bureaucracy that comes with the visa program.\par \par \uc2 "It's a labyrinthine visa process, with the slow walking of applications," Gowdy said. "You could not by accident come up with a better plan to ruin the small family farm."\par \par \uc2 Farmers, he said, "are just at their wits' end."\par \par \uc2 Using the program to get workers can put farmers at a disadvantage if their competitors decide to take their chances and hire illegal workers, Wicker said.\par \par \uc2 Lawmakers agree the visa program is problematic, but there's a wide divide on how to make it workable.\par \par \uc2 In 2009, Rep. Howard Berman, D-Calif., and Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., introduced legislation that would have given temporary resident status to immigrant farm workers and have created a path to legal residency for those workers after five years.\par \par \uc2 Neither bill, known as the AgJOBS Act, made it out committee. The idea is part of the discussion involving changes to the seasonal workers visa program, but Republicans have pledged to block it because it includes a path to legal status for immigrant workers.\par \par \uc2 Rep. Dan Lungren, a California Republican from an agriculture industry-heavy district near Sacramento, has said he sees that same "train wreck" Lofgren described, but that the AgJOBS bill isn't the answer.\par \par \uc2 "We're going to have a crisis in agriculture," Lungren said during a hearing this year on the visa program by the House Judiciary subcommittee on immigration policy and enforcement. "And while it sounds great to say an agreement (on AgJOBS) is going to take care of it, it's not going to pass."\par \par \uc2 About the only hope for success for any immigration-related legislation, Lungren and others say, is a bill that would make it mandatory for American employers to use the government's E-Verify program to ensure their workers are legal.\par \par \uc2 GOP Rep. Lamar Smith of Texas, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, has pledged to introduce such legislation. Such a proposal appeared to get a push this past week when the Supreme Court ruled 5-3 in favor of an Arizona law that allows the state to penalize businesses for hiring \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  workers.\par \par \uc2 Agriculture officials say there needs to be some exception for farm workers.\par \par \uc2 "It needs to take into account the unique aspects of agriculture," Vilsak said.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writers Gosia Wozniacka and Tracie Cone in Fresno, Calif., contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Alicia A.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) - The American Civil Liberties Union said Friday the Arizona-style immigration bill passed by the Alabama Legislature is a throwback to segregation and the organization will challenge it in court if the governor signs it into law\par \par \uc2 Gov. Robert Bentley's communications director, Rebekak Mason, said he will spend the weekend reviewing the long, complicated bill before deciding what action to take, but "having a strong illegal immigration bill has been a top priority for the governor."\par \par \uc2 The Legislature passed the bill Thursday night on votes of 67-29 in the House and 25-7 in the Senate. Support came from Republicans and some white Democrats, while black Democrats led the opposition.\par \par \uc2 The bill makes it a crime for a person without a valid federal registration or other proof of legal presence to be in Alabama, and it allows police in a traffic stop to detain anyone without legal papers if the officers have reasonable suspicion that they may be present illegally and research by the officers can't turn up any records.\par \par \uc2 "This is an Arizona bill with an Alabama twist," said the sponsor, House Republican leader Micky Hammon of Decatur.\par \par \uc2 Cecillia Wang, director of the ACLU Immigrants' Rights Project, announced plans to sue Friday.\par \par \uc2 "It's an outrageous throwback to the pre-civil rights era and we call on Governor Bentley to veto this deeply misguided bill," she said.\par \par \uc2 The bill makes it a crime for anyone to transport or house an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  and for an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  to apply for work. The bill requires all Alabama businesses to use the federal E-Verify system to check the legal status of new employees, although businesses with 25 or fewer employees could get the state Department of Homeland Security to do it for them. A business caught twice for knowingly hiring an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  would lose its business license.\par \par \uc2 Republican Sen. Scott Beason of Gardendale, who helped write the legislation, said it's designed to take jobs away from illegal immigrants and give them to legal residents. "This is a jobs bill," he said.\par \par \uc2 Wang said, "The Alabama Legislature has invited rank discrimination into people's everyday lives."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110603e763002xq\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) - The Alabama Legislature passed an Arizona-style law Thursday night to crack down on illegal immigration, including a requirement that all businesses verify new employees are legal residents.\par \par \uc2 The House voted 67-29 and the Senate concurred 25-7 in a compromise bill worked out by two Republican legislators who led the charge for the legislation, Rep. Micky Hammon of Decatur and Sen. Scott Beason of Gardendale. The bill now goes to Gov. Robert Bentley, who has advocated immigration legislation.\par \par \uc2 "This is an Arizona bill with an Alabama twist," Hammon said.\par \par \uc2 Like the Arizona law, the Alabama bill allows a police officer who stops a motorist for a traffic violation to detain the person if he has a "reasonable suspicion" the person is in the country illegally. The sponsors said that if the motorist doesn't have a driver's license or other document to show, the police officer will have to try to determine the identity by checking other records. They said "reasonable suspicion" could include acting nervously or having a tag that doesn't match vehicle registration records.\par \par \uc2 Democratic Sen. Linda Coleman of Birmingham predicted it would lead to discrimination. But Beason said, "You can't just stop someone because of how they look."\par \par \uc2 The bill requires businesses to use the federal E-Verify system to check to see if their new hires are legal residents. Businesses with 25 or fewer employees could use the state Department of Homeland Security to do the checks for them.\par \par \uc2 Any business twice cited for hiring illegal workers could lose its business license.\par \par \uc2 Beason said the checks would get rid of illegal workers that are taking jobs that should go to legal Alabama residents.\par \par \uc2 "This is a jobs bill," he said.\par \par \uc2 The bill also makes it a crime for an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  to apply for a job and for anyone to transport or harbor illegal immigrants. It prevents cities from passing laws to protect illegal immigrants in their cities.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110603e7630005t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc56}{\*\bkmkend toc56}\b \uc2 Obama administration requests National Guard stay at border be extended through September\b0\par\par\uc2 MARTHA MENDOZA   \par \uc2 AP National Writer\par \uc2 1,140 \uc2 words\par \uc2 1 June 2011\par 19:12\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2011.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 GRANJENO, Texas (AP) - A nervous man with a duffle bag of marijuana. A pack of snorting feral pigs. A woman holding a child's hand. A fluttering, rustling plastic bag. There's plenty for a National Guardsman to look at on a quiet South Texas night.\par \par \uc2 Customs and Border Protection offered a firsthand look to The Associated Press at what the troops are actually doing, around the clock, in the Rio Grande Valley in south Texas. The sound bite for the tour, often repeated, was that the soldiers are "the eyes and ears for the Border Patrol." And that appears to be the case.\par \par \uc2 And it now it appears the Guard's role could continue. The one year, 1,200 troop deployment on the border was to expire June 30. But the Obama administration is asking Congress to reprogram $30 million to keep the soldiers there at least through September.\par \par \uc2 "National Guard support along the Southwest border remains in place," said Department of Homeland Security spokesman Matthew Chandler on Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 Anticipating the end of their deployment, some units had already started moving out, said Matthew Benson, a spokesman for Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer, who has repeatedly asked the Administration for more law enforcement along the border. Those departures have stopped.\par \par \uc2 "There has been a pause in the draw-down to enable the Department of Homeland Security to explore an extension to the mission. Nothing further is known at this time," said the National Guard in a written statement from its public affairs office.\par \par \uc2 "Certainly it's a step in the right direction though we would have preferred the extension would have been longer," said Benson.\par \par \uc2 Arizona Sen. John McCain said "maintaining the limited National Guard presence currently on the ground is the least the administration can do to protect citizens living in the Southwest border region." McCain and his fellow Republican Arizona senator Jon Kyl have introduced a bill calling for a five year deployment of 6,000 National Guard troops on the border at a cost of $600 million.\par \par \uc2 During the past year's deployment, each soldier cost taxpayers about $96,000 per year, comparable -- with facilities, supplies and other expenses -- to Customs and Border Protection agents, according to their respective budgets.\par \par \uc2 The National Guard troops have augmented the Border Patrol's 21,000 agents by almost 6 percent since July, 2010. The troops serve as lookouts but are not directly involved in actual law enforcement activities. They are credited with helping arrest 17,000 illegal immigrants, almost 6 percent of those caught, according to Customs and Border Protection. The only drug that the National Guard helped seize has been marijuana: 51,000 pounds since July, 2010 -- or 2.6 percent of the almost 2 million pounds of marijuana seized by the Border Patrol during that time, said CBP.\par \par \uc2 But the troops' presence on the border is about more than arrests, seizures and security, said David Shirk, director of the University of San Diego's Trans-Border Institute.\par \par \uc2 "Symbolism and signaling does matter in politics, and the Obama administration is making an effort to clearly demonstrate to the public that the U.S. border is more heavily fortified than at any point in its history, since for many voters securing the border is an important first step prior to any conversation about reforming U.S. immigration policy," he said.\par \par \uc2 The modest deployment has been watched warily from Mexico, where the U.S. invasion 165 years ago has not been forgotten.\par \par \uc2 "The decision of the U.S. government to deploy the National Guard on the border should result in channeling additional resources to prevent illegal trafficking of weapons and cash into our country," said Mexico's President Felipe Calderon's security spokesman Alejandro Poire.\par \par \uc2 He said the troops should focus on transnational crime, and not be involved in immigration enforcement.\par \par \uc2 In the Rio Grande Valley, the troops appear largely concerned with their "eyes and ears" responsibility.\par \par \uc2 They spend 12-hour shifts taking turns sitting 30 feet up in a "Skybox," a moveable watchtower that looks like a bucket truck with a swing arm and an attached phone booth-sized box. Mercifully, the boxes are air conditioned. They're deliberately obvious, poking into the night sky as a deterrent to would-be crossers. Peering toward an orange grove through thermal imaging night vision scopes, dark shadows become shapes, and some of those shapes become suspects.\par \par \uc2 When a possible \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  or drug courier is spotted, the soldier in the Skybox radios a colleague below him in the truck and the Border Patrol, which is dispatched to investigate. The soldiers are armed, but they are not allowed to interact with suspects.\par \par \uc2 "It's obviously more of an adrenaline rush when we're going out there and kicking in doors. Here it's more of a passive role," says Sgt. Ashford. The Guard requested that first names of all soldiers be withheld, citing security concerns.\par \par \uc2 Texas National Guardsman Cpl. Martinez said he felt compelled by the 9-11 attacks to join the Army and protect his country. After a stint in Iraq, he was sent to the U.S. -Mexico border. He hopes he can stay longer.\par \par \uc2 "I feel like I'm doing my duty to country, helping keep crime from coming into the United States and that's awesome," he said. "Plus it's never boring. You'd be surprised how much stuff there is to look at."\par \par \uc2 And even for those with experience in war zones, like Cpl. Martinez, it's not boring.\par \par \uc2 "I don't know if this person is coming to find a better life or if they're looking for a way to move drugs," he says. "Either way it's wrong. If they want to come here they should do it the right way."\par \par \uc2 El Paso city councilman Beto O'Rouke is critical of the Guard's role, saying military personnel do not have the training and sensitivity to handle the complex issues that occur at the border.\par \par \uc2 "There's no place for the National Guard on the border," he says. "We will continue to get these kinds of knee-jerk approaches that do absolutely nothing to resolve legitimate concerns about security until we have real leadership in D.C."\par \par \uc2 But Texas Congressman Ted Poe says it's simple math: "We need more boots on the ground. The more National Guard troops on the border means the more security we have. Where they're placed, people won't cross."\par \par \uc2 In a similar initiative under President George W. Bush, more than 6,000 National Guard troops were deployed on the border between 2006 and 2008. National Guard officials said no weapons have been fired in the past year's deployment.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110601e761002g9\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) - California lawmakers voted Wednesday to open the door to state-funded financial aid for immigrant college students who entered the United States illegally.\par \par \uc2 The state Assembly approved AB 131, part of the California Dream Act, on a 46-25 party line vote. It now goes to the Senate.\par \par \uc2 Assemblyman Gil Cedillo, a Los Angeles Democrat, had introduced similar legislation each year since 2005 only to see it vetoed by Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, made a campaign pledge last year to sign it.\par \par \uc2 "I ask you to do what is justified and fair," Cedillo said during a short floor debate. "This is in the best interests of the state of California" and brings the state's law in line with those of the federal government, he said.\par \par \uc2 Although Cedillo's two-bill package has a similar name, it differs from the federal Dream Act, which would include a path to citizenship for immigrants in the country illegally if they attend school or serve in the military. The federal legislation stalled in Congress last year but backers have indicated they will try again.\par \par \uc2 The state Assembly approved the other half of the package last month, allowing \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students to receive private financial aid. That bill drew extensive debate on the floor; Wednesday's debate was more muted and limited as the Assembly raced through a long calendar to meet legislative deadlines this week.\par \par \uc2 Critics argued that AB 131 would encourage more illegal immigration and cut the education funding available for citizens. They contend that it makes no sense to educate immigrants for jobs they would not legally be permitted to hold.\par \par \uc2 Assemblyman Tim Donnelly, R-Twin Peaks, who has made immigration one of his legislative priorities, argued that a large number of Internet searches for information on the bill came from China.\par \par \uc2 "If you offer a benefit, people will come," he said. "Do we want to have a lot more people coming here illegally?"\par \par \uc2 Supporters of the bill have argued that students shouldn't be punished because their parents decided to enter the United States illegally, and that educated immigrants would be ready to join the work force once comprehensive immigration reforms are approved.\par \par \uc2 If approved by the Senate and signed by the governor, AB 131 would take effect July 1, 2012. The bill would expand eligibility for state-administered financial aid to qualified immigrant students who have attended a California secondary school for at least three years, including one year of high school.\par \par \uc2 The measure includes restrictions intended to make sure the number of student awards for legal California residents doesn't shrink, and limits the award of competitive Cal Grant funds to immigrants. Applications for competitive Cal Grants already exceed the amount of money available, so it's unlikely that immigrant students would have a chance for them.\par \par \uc2 But other aid and program changes would add at least an estimated $14 million in General Fund costs and could change the mix of students who receive institutional aid from the University of California and California State University systems, and the amounts they receive.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110601e7610026n\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) - As the legislative session drew near to a close, South Carolina senators decided Tuesday to postpone voting on a bill that would require officers to try to check suspects' immigration status.\par \par \uc2 Senators must decide whether to further amend or accept legislation the House approved last week. They'll likely take it up Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 Sen. Larry Martin, R-Pickens, said he'll ask senators to approve some minor wording changes, as well as possible changes to put South Carolina's existing law in line with a federal ruling. A panel he leads was set to meet Tuesday on the amendments. The director of the state's labor agency was also expected to testify about last week's U.S. Supreme Court decision on illegal immigration. But the meeting had to be rescheduled as debate continued on the Senate floor.\par \par \uc2 Martin said he expects the Legislature to wrap up work on the bill before the regular session ends Thursday. However, it could be taken up if a special session later this month if necessary.\par \par \uc2 Supporters of the measure say they hope the law would cause illegal immigrants to leave the state and free up jobs. Opponents say it will encourage racial profiling and invite lawsuits.\par \par \uc2 The bill specifies that a check of immigration status must follow a stop or arrest for something else. Someone with a valid driver's license, military ID or passport would be presumed a legal resident.\par \par \uc2 Unlike a law passed in Arizona last year, the South Carolina proposal bars officers from holding someone on the suspicion of being an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Though the proposal specifies that suspicion can't be based on race, color or national origin, opponents contend that clause is meaningless. They argue that by not defining "reasonable suspicion," lawmakers would allow abuse.\par \par \uc2 The measure would also make it a felony to make fake photo IDs for illegal immigrants. Convicted offenders would be fined $25,000 and imprisoned up to five years. Illegal workers could also be fined and sent to jail for carrying a fraudulent ID. A second offense would be a felony punishable by up to $500 and five years in prison.\par \par \uc2 and would create a new unit within the Department of Public Safety to enforce the state's immigration law. The version passed by the Senate earlier this year tacked a fee onto out-of-country wire transfers in an attempt to tax immigrants who send money home. The resulting revenue was supposed to fund the new unit. But the House removed that provision, saying it would tax legal residents too, including military families and online shoppers who buy items from companies that operate or process payments overseas.\par \par \uc2 The bill also allows residents to sue local governments that limit or bar officers from following the law.\par \par \uc2 Last week, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld an Arizona law that penalizes businesses for hiring workers in the country illegally. That law is similar to one that South Carolina passed in 2008, requiring businesses to use the E-verify system to check workers' legal status or else hire only people who hold a valid driver's license from South Carolina or other state with similarly strict license requirements.\par \par \uc2 The requirements began applying to South Carolina businesses of all sizes last year. Changes added by the House include toughening penalties for businesses that repeatedly violate the law.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110531e75v002wb\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc61}{\*\bkmkend toc61}\b \uc2 Excerpts from recent editorials in Indiana newspapers\b0\par\par\uc2 By The Associated Press   \par \uc2 1,439 \uc2 words\par \uc2 31 May 2011\par 15:52\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2011.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The News-Sentinel, Fort Wayne. May 31, 2011.\par \par \uc2 A good sign for Indiana's new immigration law\par \par \uc2 The U.S. Supreme Court recently upheld Arizona's 2007 law requiring all employers in the state to use the federal E-Verify system for screening out illegal aliens and revoking the business licenses of firms that knowingly hire them. The opinion, written by Chief Justice John Roberts, said Arizona's law does not improperly intrude upon federal prerogatives because the federal Immigration Reform and Control Act contains a clause that explicitly allows states to use licensing provisions to punish employers.\par \par \uc2 The timing couldn't be better for Indiana, which has its own recently passed E-Verify law that has just been challenged by an ACLU-of-Indiana lawsuit. The Arizona victory is not a guarantee of success for Indiana in the lawsuit; some of the ACLU's complaints involve provisions of the Indiana law not in the Arizona statute. But the core of its objection is the "federal prerogative" complaint.\par \par \uc2 Indiana, Arizona and a growing number of states are starting to realize that going after employers instead of increasing police powers is the more effective way to curb illegal immigration. The immigrants come here to work -- take that away, and they have no reason to flout our laws. Threaten the livelihood of American companies, and they tend to respond.\par \par \uc2 A look at the numbers from Arizona shows how effective employer sanctions can be. As \uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2  population dropped 7 percent nationwide from 2008 to 2009, the number in Arizona fell by nearly 18 percent, which many attribute to the E-Verify program.\par \par \uc2 And the ruling is important far beyond the one issue it addressed. It has the potential to reinvigorate the whole concept of federalism on which this country was founded and which is in such a sorry state.\par \par \uc2 Our government was designed to preserve state and local autonomy by carefully limiting the reach of the federal government to specific, enumerated powers. Anything else was forbidden to it and reserved to the states and "the people." But because of post-Civil War amendments and "reinterpretations" of the original text, that arrangement has been turned on its head. It is now the federal government that can do anything it wants, the states that must beg for permission.\par \par \uc2 As a result, some vital things can go undone. If the federal government refuses to do something, and the states aren't allowed to do it, then nothing at all is possible. That is exactly where we are with immigration today.\par \par \uc2 We will never get back to the original concept of federalism. But some balance can be restored, and this Supreme Court seems at least willing to look in that direction.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 South Bend Tribune. May 31, 2011.\par \par \uc2 Use care driving in work zones\par \par \uc2 For Indiana drivers traveling the state, the highway construction season offers more than $1.5 billion worth of compelling reasons for proceeding with caution.\par \par \uc2 According to the Indiana Department of Transportation, that's the price tag on new highway projects slated to begin construction throughout the state. All of which creates the need for numerous construction zones throughout Indiana.\par \par \uc2 The necessity of taking care when traveling in these areas seems obvious; the consequences for failing to do so can be tragic. Last year, 12 people died and 602 were injured in work zone crashes throughout Indiana. InDOT reports that four out of every five people killed in work zones are motorists.\par \par \uc2 Those who don't obey the rules should expect steep fines and penalties, thanks to Indiana's work zone law, which went into effect a few years ago, raising fines for speeding in a work zone to $300 for a first offense, $500 for a second offense and $1,000 for a third offense in a three-year period.\par \par \uc2 Driving recklessly in work zones is a Class D felony if you injure a worker or are driving drunk, punishable by up to three years in prison and a $10,000 fine. Killing a worker while driving recklessly and aggressively in a work zone is punishable by up to eight years in prison and up to $10,000 in fines.\par \par \uc2 InDOT offers drivers these safety tips for navigating in work zones:\par \par \uc2 -- Stay alert and look for reduced speed limits, narrow lanes and highway workers.\par \par \uc2 -- Merge early, so that traffic will flow more smoothly.\par \par \uc2 -- Maintain a safe distance on all sides of your vehicle.\par \par \uc2 -- Minimize distractions.\par \par \uc2 -- Plan ahead. Expect delays and allow extra travel time.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Journal and Courier, Lafayette. May 28, 2011.\par \par \uc2 Daniels has expertise Washington, D.C., needs\par \par \uc2 It's been days since Gov. Mitch Daniels burst all the "Run, Mitch, Run" hopes of Republicans here and across the country.\par \par \uc2 Daniels, many pundits said, had the makings of a contender to be the GOP standard-bearer in the 2012 presidential race.\par \par \uc2 He has proven fiscal discipline, as evident by his leadership in Indiana, where he reversed a $1 billion deficit in one year and kept the state's books in the black through the recession of 2008.\par \par \uc2 He's a proven reformer, as noted by the many Hoosiers still complaining about issues such as moving Indiana to daylight saving time and education reforms.\par \par \uc2 He's an innovator who thinks beyond traditional partisan politics to find alternatives and takes the flak for it. His idea to lease the Indiana toll road, for example, generated mounds of cash to build state highways, but his efforts to privatize parts of food stamps applications failed. He's been sharply criticized for both.\par \par \uc2 Daniels is a fixer, a talented businessman and a skilled politician. He changed the Bureau of Motor Vehicles, adding efficiencies that ended long waits that aggravated customers for as long as most can remember.\par \par \uc2 Without detailing Daniels' resume, suffice it to say, there are good reasons he was considered a contender. And although he's not running for president, the winner of the 2012 election -- regardless of political party -- would be well advised to seek Daniels' counsel.\par \par \uc2 Daniels, for example, understands that the nation's looming fiscal crisis is bigger than the social issues that divide the political parties. He's proposed a truce on social issues in order to right the nation's financial ship. And although he signed a controversial bill about funding of agencies that provide abortions, he did not initiate the legislation or advocate for it.\par \par \uc2 The governor might have decided not to run for president, but he remains what Washington needs -- common sense and a proven list of accomplishments. Perhaps there are other ways to use Daniels' considerable talents.\par \par \uc2 Excluding Daniels because he decided against a run for the presidency would be like not passing the basketball back to a strong three-point shooter.\par \par \uc2 At the very least, he should be an economic adviser to the next president, perhaps a Cabinet member.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Evansville Courier & Press. May 27, 2011.\par \par \uc2 Decision on unlawful entry raises concerns\par \par \uc2 Hoosiers from the attorney general to the governor to college students protesting at the Statehouse in Indianapolis are rightly concerned about an Indiana Supreme Court decision broadening the power of police to make an unlawful entry into a home.\par \par \uc2 In the Vanderburgh County case, Richard Barnes of Evansville tried to block police, called there for a domestic disturbance, from entering his home. After he shoved an officer who was pushing his way into the home, Barnes was shocked with a stun gun and arrested. Later he was convicted of four misdemeanor charges.\par \par \uc2 On appeal, the Indiana Supreme Court ruled 3-2 that people have no right to resist, even if police officers illegally enter their homes. The majority said that to allow people to resist unnecessarily elevates the level of violence and risk of injury. The remedy, the court said, is in civil court.\par \par \uc2 But since the ruling was handed down, Hoosiers have questioned whether the decision violates constitutional protection against unreasonable searches and seizures.\par \par \uc2 Even Indiana Attorney General Greg Zoeller, who won the Barnes case, said he never sought such a broad ruling. Gov. Mitch Daniels said he was puzzled by the decision. And some lawmakers have said that a narrower ruling, addressing only domestic disturbances, might have been more acceptable.\par \par \uc2 Zoeller said the Indiana Supreme Court should rehear the case and offer a more narrow interpretation in the case.\par \par \uc2 While we believe the court should never bend to public protest and opinion -- its job is to interpret the law -- it could take Zoeller's suggestion and provide Hoosiers some needed clarity in the matter of privacy in their own homes.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110531e75v002ve\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc62}{\*\bkmkend toc62}\b \uc2 SF sheriff wants to use new immigration policy to comply with city's Sanctuary law\b0\par\par\uc2 TERRY COLLINS   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 986 \uc2 words\par \uc2 30 May 2011\par 16:24\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2011.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - If the San Francisco sheriff's plan becomes reality, illegal immigrants arrested for petty crimes won't be held in jail longer than necessary, even if federal immigration agents may want them detained for possible deportation.\par \par \uc2 Instead, starting Wednesday, deputies will treat those eligible for release just like U.S. citizens: They will be cited to appear in court.\par \par \uc2 City officials, however, aren't so sure about Sheriff Mike Hennessey's plan.\par \par \uc2 The new policy is his attempt to comply with a city law that prevents police from aiding federal authorities in non-felony crimes and a U.S. law that requires authorities to share fingerprints with immigration agents.\par \par \uc2 "I'm in a position where I'm trying to enforce a local law as well as not violate the federal law and this is the `in-between,'" he said. "It's a difficult area to tread on because emotions run very high here in California and throughout the country on immigration issues."\par \par \uc2 Under Hennessey's policy, illegal immigrants who commit misdemeanors, such as disorderly conduct, trespassing or shoplifting, will not be held while the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) checks their status through a fingerprinting monitoring program.\par \par \uc2 Hennessey said the change is meant to coincide with the city's "Sanctuary City" law, which aims to provide refuge for illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Mayor Ed Lee's office did not receive advance notice of the policy change, said Christine Falvey, Lee's press secretary, in a prepared statement.\par \par \uc2 "We have reached out to federal authorities to determine if this new policy contradicts federal law," Falvey said. "We are awaiting clarification."\par \par \uc2 The sheriff's new policy comes as the California Assembly on Thursday approved a bill to revise the state's agreement on using the federal Secure Communities program. The measure, which would allow counties to opt out, now moves to the state Senate.\par \par \uc2 San Francisco and nearby Santa Clara county have sought permission from the federal government to opt out of Secure Communities.\par \par \uc2 Hennessey said his policy is similar to San Miguel and Taos counties in New Mexico. He said San Francisco's policy will protect public safety because immigrants would be more willing to report crimes if they didn't fear arrest and possible deportation.\par \par \uc2 ICE Spokeswoman Virginia Kice said Hennessey's decision is "unfortunate." In San Francisco County, ICE has taken custody of 731 deportable immigrants since Secure Communities began in June 2010, Kice said.\par \par \uc2 Nearly 40 percent had prior criminal convictions for felonies or multiple misdemeanors, she added.\par \par \uc2 Angela Chan, an attorney with the Asian Law Caucus and a San Francisco Police Commission member, said 68 percent of the people deported under the Secure Communities program in California did not commit serious crimes.\par \par \uc2 "That puts a lot of people at risk," Chan said. "That's why there's such uproar over this program."\par \par \uc2 Hennessey said he learned that keeping immigrants with ICE detainers behind bars is a courtesy and not mandatory after meeting with Secure Communities director David Venturella late last year.\par \par \uc2 Hennessey's move is drawing some sharp criticism.\par \par \uc2 "The borders will never be secure as long as places like San Francisco lay out the welcome mat," said Tom Fitton, president of Judicial Watch, a Washington, D.C.-based legal advocacy group that is suing the city over similar immigration issues.\par \par \uc2 "These policies put illegal immigrants above the law," Fitton said.\par \par \uc2 Fitton cited a 2008 incident in San Francisco where three members of a family were shot to death by a gang member who was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  and had been released from custody as a juvenile.\par \par \uc2 "I can guarantee you people will die by this decision," Fitton said.\par \par \uc2 Addressing the Assembly before its vote last week, San Francisco Assemblyman Tom Ammiano said immigration officials were well aware of the gang member's status.\par \par \uc2 "In fact, that assailant was reported to ICE, and you know what happened? ICE did not act on that complaint. That's what happened. Because they were probably out busting a crossing guard, or arresting a mother on her way to work at a hotel," Ammiano said.\par \par \uc2 Secure Communities began in 2008 as an initiative to identify and deport illegal immigrants who have committed serious crimes as local authorities share their fingerprints with the Department of Homeland Security.\par \par \uc2 The program operates in over 1,300 jurisdictions in 42 states. ICE has since removed more than 77,000 criminal aliens including more than 28,000 offenders with prior convictions for serious or violent offenses, such as murder, rape and child sexual abuse, Kice said.\par \par \uc2 And the program will be mandatory for every state and county by 2013, Homeland Security secretary Janet Napolitano recently said.\par \par \uc2 However, several other states including Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, and Washington have complained that Secure Communities doesn't just deport convicted felons. Crime victims and witnesses could be swept up, too.\par \par \uc2 Earlier this month, Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn announced that the state intends to withdraw from the program, calling it "flawed." He said nearly a third of all illegal immigrants deported under the program were not convicted of any crimes.\par \par \uc2 In Minnesota, legislators are currently debating on whether to become the 43rd state to join Secure Communities.\par \par \uc2 Kice, the ICE spokeswoman, said 71 percent of the illegal immigrants removed or returned through Secure Communities had criminal convictions. She said 29 percent were non-criminal immigration violators, including those who had been removed earlier and visa violators.\par \par \uc2 Hennessey said his policy has received mixed public reaction. While he expects some harsh feedback, he doesn't see it stopping.\par \par \uc2 "Believe me, if I've done something wrong, the federal government will sue to stop me. And I'm not hearing anything on that level," Hennessey said. "I don't want to break the law."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110530e75u0039p\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

He could face five to 56 more years in prison.\par \par \uc2 Senior District Court Judge James Brennan set sentencing June 21.\par \par \uc2 Duarte-Herrera, of Nicaragua, is already serving life without parole plus 19 to 50 years in the May 2007 bombing that killed a 24-year-old man in the parking lot outside the Luxor hotel-casino. That device was a small pipe bomb with a magnetic switch hidden in a coffee cup and placed atop the victim's car.\par \par \uc2 Authorities said the \uc2 Home Depot\uc2  parking lot bomb was powerful but more rudimentary, and was set off by an electric timing device.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutor Dave Stanton told The Associated Press the blast whipped shards of metal over a wide area and into a busy nearby street. However, traffic had stopped for a red traffic signal and no one was walking past at the time.\par \par \uc2 "It was like shooting into a crowd and missing everyone," Stanton said. "It was incredibly lucky no one was injured or killed."\par \par \uc2 The jury in the \uc2 Home Depot\uc2  case heard nothing about the Luxor case until after their verdict on Wednesday. Duarte-Herrera didn't testify during the three-day trial, and Stanton said jurors deliberated about an hour.\par \par \uc2 Defense lawyers Clark Patrick and Charles Cano said Duarte-Herrera maintains his innocence and they intend to appeal.\par \par \uc2 Thomas Chittum III, chief agent of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms & Explosives office in Las Vegas, said authorities think Duarte-Herrera also detonated a practice bomb in the desert outside Las Vegas some time before the \uc2 Home Depot\uc2  blast. Investigators have never found the site.\par \par \uc2 "It appears that his devices were getting more sophisticated," Chittum said.\par \par \uc2 The victim in the Luxor case, Willebaldo Dorantes Antonio, was dating the ex-girlfriend of Duarte-Herrera's co-defendant, Omar Rueda-Denvers.\par \par \uc2 A jury convicted both men of first-degree murder and other charges, but chose to spare them the death penalty. Rueda-Denvers, now 36, is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Guatemala who also uses the name Alexander Perez. He is serving life in prison plus 16 to 40 years.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110527e75r002h9\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

(AP) - A Guatemala man sentenced for stabbing his girlfriend in their Kearney apartment should have an opportunity to argue that his attorney was ineffective, the Nebraska Supreme Court said in an opinion issued Friday.\par \par \uc2 The court said Mauro Yos-Chiguil is entitled to an evidentiary hearing so a judge can consider the merits of his claim. A Buffalo County District Court had denied the request.\par \par \uc2 Yos-Chiguil, 35, pleaded no contest to attempted murder and assault charges in the December 2007 stabbing and was sentenced to 18 to 28 years in prison. After he completes his sentence, Yos-Chiguil could face deportation. Authorities have said he is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 But Yos-Chiguil said in his appeal that he didn't know his plea would affect his attempt to become a naturalized U.S. citizen. He said he would have pleaded not guilty and taken his case to trial had his attorney allowed him to pursue an intoxication defense, meaning he was too drunk to know what he was doing. The Nebraska Legislature passed a bill this session that bans such defenses.\par \par \uc2 Authorities have said Yos-Chiguil stabbed his girlfriend and mother of his twin sons in her head, shoulder, chest and stomach in their northwest Kearney apartment. She was released after treatment at a local hospital. The girlfriend's teenage sister was also injured.\par \par \uc2 Yos-Chiguil filed the appeal himself. The high court ruled an attorney would be appointed to assist him for the hearing.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110527e75r001y2\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) - Democrats in California's Assembly joined other states Thursday in questioning the federal system that uses fingerprints to check the immigration status of people picked up by police.\par \par \uc2 The Assembly approved AB1081 on a 43-22 party line vote after heated debate over public safety and whether the measure would help or hurt it.\par \par \uc2 The bill would add new restrictions and let counties opt out of the state agreement on use of the Secure Communities automatic fingerprint program to screen for citizenship and criminal background.\par \par \uc2 The legislation now moves to the state Senate.\par \par \uc2 Other states have taken similar steps amid complaints the program is supposed to help deport convicted felons but has also swept up crime victims, witnesses and people who were arrested but never convicted.\par \par \uc2 Assemblyman Tom Ammiano, D-San Francisco, argued that his bill would protect public safety because immigrants would be more willing to report crime if they didn't fear deportation.\par \par \uc2 The fingerprint program "has actually harmed public safety and seriously undercut community policing strategies," he said.\par \par \uc2 Comparing fingerprints against federal records under the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement program led to the deportation of nearly 36,000 undocumented immigrants from California from October 2008 through February 2011, according to an analysis of the bill by legislative staff.\par \par \uc2 However, 27 percent were not criminals, and 41 percent were considered low-level offenders.\par \par \uc2 Opponents said the bill would leave criminals free who should be deported.\par \par \uc2 "This bill expands the concept of sanctuary cities to sanctuary counties," said Assemblyman Tim Donnelly, R-Twin Peaks, who helped found a Minuteman chapter in Southern California and introduced a bill that echoed major elements of Arizona's controversial immigration enforcement bill. That California bill was shot down this session in committee.\par \par \uc2 Donnelly cited a 2008 San Francisco case in which three members of a family were shot to death by a gang member who was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  and had been released from custody as a juvenile.\par \par \uc2 The bill "is going to lead to more deaths," he said.\par \par \uc2 California was among the earliest states to agree to use the fingerprint program. States that adopted it later included more safeguards to protect crime victims, traffic violators and others suspected of minor offenses.\par \par \uc2 Ammiano's bill would require changes to California's agreement to protect juveniles and domestic violence victims; allow county governments to decide whether to participate; add protections against racial profiling; ban use of checkpoints for the purpose of checking fingerprints; and submit only the fingerprints of those convicted of a crime rather than those accused.\par \par \uc2 Officials in Los Angeles and San Francisco have raised concerns about the Secure Communities program, with San Francisco about to start limiting the information it shares.\par \par \uc2 On Wednesday, sheriffs from Yolo County in California and Kane County in Illinois held a news conference with immigration activists to oppose the program.\par \par \uc2 Illinois has decided to stop participating, and Washington state has left participation up to local jurisdictions, Federal officials have argued that states have no say in what information is shared among federal agencies.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110527e75r0008o\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHOENIX (AP) - The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld an Arizona law that penalizes businesses for hiring workers in the country illegally, buoying the hopes of supporters of state crackdowns on illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 They predicted the ruling would lead to many other states passing laws that require employers to use the federal E-Verify system to check that workers aren't illegal immigrants. And some said the ruling bodes well for the prospects of a much broader and more controversial immigration law in Arizona, known as SB1070, to be found constitutional.\par \par \uc2 The state is appealing a ruling blocking portions of that law from taking effect.\par \par \uc2 But some legal experts said the ruling should not be read as a broad validation of such tactics. While they acknowledge that other states will now pass similar employer sanctions, they cautioned that the court did not make any sweeping endorsement of states' rights to enforce federal immigration laws.\par \par \uc2 "It's a very careful and narrowly reasoned opinion, so it doesn't really tip the court's hand one way or the other with respect to SB1070," said Peter Spiro, a Temple University law professor who specializes in immigration law. "That being said, the court here is validating a state measure that implicates immigration enforcement. The court today has rejected an argument that the states have no business in immigration enforcement. That's off the table."\par \par \uc2 Arizona Senate President Russell Pearce, a Republican who was a prime sponsor of the legislation that became the 2007 employer sanctions law, said his reaction to the ruling was "jubilation."\par \par \uc2 "This is not only good for Arizona, it's good for America," Pearce told The Associated Press. "Finally, American workers are treated the way they ought to be. We're going to put the profits-before-patriotism crowd in the back seat."\par \par \uc2 Pearce said the ruling bodes well for an eventual Supreme Court decision on SB1070.\par \par \uc2 "I'm very confident we'll win a 5-4 or possibly a 6-3 decision," he said. "States have never been pre-empted from enforcing federal law."\par \par \uc2 Both laws were written with the assistance of Kris Kobach, Kansas' secretary of state and a former law professor. He said they were constructed to only use federal immigration law definitions, and the ruling upholding the first could mean success for the second.\par \par \uc2 "That language will vastly assist the state in defending SB1070,' Kobach said.\par \par \uc2 Others aren't so sure. Arizona State University constitutional law professor Paul Bender said Chief Justice John Roberts went out of his way to say the employer sanctions law was being enforced in conjunction with the federal government because its provisions mimic federal law.\par \par \uc2 That's not the case with SB1070, Bender said. With that Arizona law, police decide who to detain, and illegal immigrants can be prosecuted in state court.\par \par \uc2 "If they really mean that this is OK but only because there are safeguards here to make sure the states don't go crazy and start doing things contrary to federal policy, that would bode ill for 1070," Bender said. "Because 1070 does not have these safeguards and there's a real danger."\par \par \uc2 Dozens of other states have taken up immigration-related measures since Arizona passed its first law. Most have gone nowhere, but several have passed laws similar to the one found constitutional on Thursday.\par \par \uc2 "So far Mississippi and South Carolina have followed Arizona in requiring E-Verify,' Kobach said. "Alabama is about to ... and I think you'll see many other states jumping on the bandwagon and requiring E-Verify."\par \par \uc2 Thursday's 5-3 ruling placed the court's five Republican-appointed justices on the side of the state and against the Chamber of Commerce, which challenged the law along with the American Civil Liberties Union.\par \par \uc2 Roberts, writing for the majority, said Arizona's employer sanctions law "falls well within the confines of the authority Congress chose to leave to the states."\par \par \uc2 Justices Stephen Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor, all Democratic appointees, dissented. The fourth Democratic appointee, Justice Elena Kagan, did not participate in the case because she worked on it while serving as President Barack Obama's solicitor general.\par \par \uc2 Breyer said the Arizona law upsets a balance in federal law between dissuading employers from hiring illegal workers and ensuring that people are not discriminated against because they may speak with an accent or look like they might be immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Employers "will hesitate to hire those they fear will turn out to lack the right to work in the United States," he said.\par \par \uc2 The Obama administration backed the challenge to the law. The measure was signed into law in 2007 by Democrat Janet Napolitano, then the governor of Arizona and now Obama's Homeland Security secretary.\par \par \uc2 The employer sanctions law has been infrequently used. It was intended to diminish Arizona's role as the nation's hub for immigrant smuggling by requiring employers to verify the eligibility of new workers through a federal database. Employers found to have violated the law can have their business licenses suspended or revoked.\par \par \uc2 Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, praised the high court's decision. "Not only is this law constitutional, it is commonsense. American jobs should be preserved for Americans and legal workers," Smith said.\par \par \uc2 Lower courts, including the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, previously upheld the law.\par \par \uc2 The ACLU's Cecillia Wang said the Supreme Court decision was disappointing, but narrow. "The decision has nothing to do with SB1070 or any other state and local immigration laws," said Wang, director of ACLU's immigrant rights project.\par \par \uc2 Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer called the decision gratifying and said it upheld states' rights.\par \par \uc2 "Despite the Obama Administration's opposition at the U.S. Supreme Court, Arizona and all states are now free to take down the `Help Wanted' sign for illegal aliens in their states," she said in a statement. "Arizona's employer sanctions law allows the vast majority of businesses that want to play by the rules to comply with federal and state laws against hiring illegal aliens, and seeks to punish those employers who take advantage of the federal government's immigration failures."\par \par \uc2 Last month, a three-judge panel of that same appeals court upheld a trial judge's ruling blocking enforcement of parts of SB1070. The provisions that were blocked include a requirement that police, while enforcing other laws, must question a person's immigration status if officers have reasonable suspicion the person was in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 Other provisions that are on hold include: requiring all immigrants to obtain or carry immigration registration papers; making it a state criminal offense for an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  to seek work or hold a job; and allowing police to arrest suspected illegal immigrants without a warrant.\par \par \uc2 Brewer said she is hopeful the latest ruling means the high court will also uphold SB1070.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Sherman reported from Washington.

(AP) - Democrats in California's Assembly joined other states Thursday in questioning the federal system that uses fingerprints to check the immigration status of people picked up by police.\par \par \uc2 The Assembly approved AB1081 on a 43-22 party line vote after heated debate over public safety and whether the measure would help or hurt it.\par \par \uc2 The bill would add new restrictions and let counties opt out of the state agreement on use of the Safe Communities automatic fingerprint program to screen for citizenship and criminal background.\par \par \uc2 The legislation now moves to the state Senate.\par \par \uc2 Other states have taken similar steps amid complaints the program is supposed to help deport convicted felons but has also swept up crime victims, witnesses and people who were arrested but never convicted.\par \par \uc2 Assemblyman Tom Ammiano, D-San Francisco, argued that his bill would protect public safety because immigrants would be more willing to report crime if they didn't fear deportation.\par \par \uc2 The fingerprint program "has actually harmed public safety and seriously undercut community policing strategies," he said.\par \par \uc2 Comparing fingerprints against federal records under the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement program led to the deportation of nearly 36,000 undocumented immigrants from California from October 2008 through February 2011, according to an analysis of the bill by legislative staff.\par \par \uc2 However, 27 percent were not criminals, and 41 percent were considered low-level offenders.\par \par \uc2 Opponents said the bill would leave criminals free who should be deported.\par \par \uc2 "This bill expands the concept of sanctuary cities to sanctuary counties," said Assemblyman Tim Donnelly, R-Twin Peaks, who helped found a Minuteman chapter in Southern California and introduced a bill that echoed major elements of Arizona's controversial immigration enforcement bill. That California bill was shot down this session in committee.\par \par \uc2 Donnelly cited a 2008 San Francisco case in which three members of a family were shot to death by a gang member who was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  and had been released from custody as a juvenile.\par \par \uc2 The bill "is going to lead to more deaths," he said.\par \par \uc2 California was among the earliest states to agree to use the fingerprint program. States that adopted it later included more safeguards to protect crime victims, traffic violators and others suspected of minor offenses.\par \par \uc2 Ammiano's bill would require changes to California's agreement to protect juveniles and domestic violence victims; allow county governments to decide whether to participate; add protections against racial profiling; ban use of checkpoints for the purpose of checking fingerprints; and submit only the fingerprints of those convicted of a crime rather than those accused.\par \par \uc2 Officials in Los Angeles and San Francisco have raised concerns about the Safe Communities program, with San Francisco about to start limiting the information it shares.\par \par \uc2 On Wednesday, sheriffs from Yolo County in California and Kane County in Illinois held a news conference with immigration activists to oppose the program.\par \par \uc2 Illinois has decided to stop participating, and Washington state has left participation up to local jurisdictions, Federal officials have argued that states have no say in what information is shared among federal agencies.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110526e75q003hk\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHOENIX (AP) - The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld an Arizona law that penalizes businesses for hiring workers in the country illegally, buoying the hopes of supporters of state crackdowns on illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 They predicted the ruling would lead to many other states passing laws that require employers to use the federal E-Verify system to check that workers aren't illegal immigrants. And some said the ruling bodes well for the prospects of a much broader and more controversial immigration law in Arizona, known as SB1070, to be found constitutional.\par \par \uc2 The state is appealing a ruling blocking that law from taking effect.\par \par \uc2 But some legal experts said the ruling should not be read as a broad validation of such tactics. While they acknowledge that other states will now pass similar employer sanctions, they cautioned that the court did not make any sweeping endorsement of states' rights to enforce federal immigration laws.\par \par \uc2 "It's a very careful and narrowly reasoned opinion, so it doesn't really tip the court's hand one way or the other with respect to SB1070," said Peter Spiro, a Temple University law professor who specializes in immigration law. "That being said, the court here is validating a state measure that implicates immigration enforcement. The court today has rejected an argument that the states have no business in immigration enforcement. That's off the table."\par \par \uc2 Arizona Senate President Russell Pearce, a Republican who was a prime sponsor of the legislation that became the 2007 employer sanctions law, said his reaction to the ruling was "jubilation."\par \par \uc2 "This is not only good for Arizona, it's good for America," Pearce told The Associated Press. "Finally, American workers are treated the way they ought to be. We're going to put the profits-before-patriotism crowd in the back seat."\par \par \uc2 Pearce said the ruling bodes well for an eventual Supreme Court decision on SB1070.\par \par \uc2 "I'm very confident we'll win a 5-4 or possibly a 6-3 decision," he said. "States have never been pre-empted from enforcing federal law."\par \par \uc2 Both laws were written with the assistance of Kris Kobach, Kansas' secretary of state and a former law professor. He said they were constructed to only use federal immigration law definitions, and the ruling upholding the first could mean success for the second.\par \par \uc2 "That language will vastly assist the state in defending SB1070,' Kobach said.\par \par \uc2 Others aren't so sure. Arizona State University constitutional law professor Paul Bender said Chief Justice John Roberts went out of his way to say the employer sanctions law was being enforced in conjunction with the federal government because its provisions mimic federal law.\par \par \uc2 That's not the case with SB1070, Bender said. With that Arizona law, police decide who to detain, and illegal immigrants can be prosecuted in state court.\par \par \uc2 "If they really mean that this is OK but only because there are safeguards here to make sure the states don't go crazy and start doing things contrary to federal policy, that would bode ill for 1070," Bender said. "Because 1070 does not have these safeguards and there's a real danger."\par \par \uc2 Dozens of other states have taken up immigration-related measures since Arizona passed its first law. Most have gone nowhere, but several have passed laws similar to the one found constitutional on Thursday.\par \par \uc2 "So far Mississippi and South Carolina have followed Arizona in requiring E-Verify,' Kobach said. "Alabama is about to ... and I think you'll see many other states jumping on the bandwagon and requiring E-Verify."\par \par \uc2 Thursday's 5-3 ruling placed the court's five Republican-appointed justices on the side of the state and against the Chamber of Commerce, which challenged the law along with the American Civil Liberties Union.\par \par \uc2 Roberts, writing for the majority, said Arizona's employer sanctions law "falls well within the confines of the authority Congress chose to leave to the states."\par \par \uc2 Justices Stephen Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor, all Democratic appointees, dissented. The fourth Democratic appointee, Justice Elena Kagan, did not participate in the case because she worked on it while serving as President Barack Obama's solicitor general.\par \par \uc2 Breyer said the Arizona law upsets a balance in federal law between dissuading employers from hiring illegal workers and ensuring that people are not discriminated against because they may speak with an accent or look like they might be immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Employers "will hesitate to hire those they fear will turn out to lack the right to work in the United States," he said.\par \par \uc2 The Obama administration backed the challenge to the law. The measure was signed into law in 2007 by Democrat Janet Napolitano, then the governor of Arizona and now Obama's Homeland Security secretary.\par \par \uc2 The employer sanctions law has been infrequently used. It was intended to diminish Arizona's role as the nation's hub for immigrant smuggling by requiring employers to verify the eligibility of new workers through a federal database. Employers found to have violated the law can have their business licenses suspended or revoked.\par \par \uc2 Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, praised the high court's decision. "Not only is this law constitutional, it is commonsense. American jobs should be preserved for Americans and legal workers," Smith said.\par \par \uc2 Lower courts, including the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, previously upheld the law.\par \par \uc2 The ACLU's Cecillia Wang said the Supreme Court decision was disappointing, but narrow. "The decision has nothing to do with SB1070 or any other state and local immigration laws," said Wang, director of ACLU's immigrant rights project.\par \par \uc2 Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer called the decision gratifying and said it upheld states' rights.\par \par \uc2 "Despite the Obama Administration's opposition at the U.S. Supreme Court, Arizona and all states are now free to take down the `Help Wanted' sign for illegal aliens in their states," she said in a statement. "Arizona's employer sanctions law allows the vast majority of businesses that want to play by the rules to comply with federal and state laws against hiring illegal aliens, and seeks to punish those employers who take advantage of the federal government's immigration failures."\par \par \uc2 Last month, a three-judge panel of that same appeals court upheld a trial judge's ruling blocking enforcement of parts of SB1070. The provisions that were blocked include a requirement that police, while enforcing other laws, must question a person's immigration status if officers have reasonable suspicion the person was in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 Other provisions that are on hold include: requiring all immigrants to obtain or carry immigration registration papers; making it a state criminal offense for an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  to seek work or hold a job; and allowing police to arrest suspected illegal immigrants without a warrant.\par \par \uc2 State officials have said they will appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court. Brewer said she is hopeful the latest ruling means the high court will also uphold SB1070.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Sherman reported from Washington.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) - The Washington Legislature on Wednesday approved an increase in premiums for some \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  children enrolled in the state's health care program for poor children. In a session full of budget cuts, children's health advocates welcomed the measure.\par \par \uc2 "It took a monumental effort to protect the health of our state's children. In the end, families, advocates and supportive legislators succeeded in blocking attempts to limit enrollment or deny coverage to children," said Children's Alliance deputy director Jon Gould.\par \par \uc2 Earlier this year, Gov. Chris Gregoire proposed cutting the 26,000 \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  children enrolled in the program, called Apple Health for Kids. An earlier Senate plan would have reduced enrollment as well.\par \par \uc2 About 725,000 total children -- citizens, residents and illegal immigrants -- are covered, according to the Department of Social and Health Services.\par \par \uc2 Under the approved proposal, families with \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  children and incomes above 200 percent of the federal poverty line will pay higher premiums. For example, a family of three that makes more than $37,000 a year would pay more, according to the Children's Alliance.\par \par \uc2 The measure raises the monthly premiums for those families from between $20 and $30 to between $80 and $90. The bill passed unanimously in the Senate on Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 Sen. Steve Hobbs, D-Lake Stevens, said that by maintaining the program, the state protects the "most vulnerable."\par \par \uc2 Hobbs, a member of a moderate-conservative group in the Senate, was integral in forging this bill, along with House negotiators who held steady to not cutting children out of health care, Gould said. It took negotiations to move away from cutting enrollment to the program.\par \par \uc2 Gould said the group will now seek sponsors for families who can't afford the hike in premiums.\par \par \uc2 "No child should go without the health care they need," Gould said.\par \par \uc2 The advocacy group also says the state could earn about $80 million in federal grants now that all enrollments will be left nearly untouched. The DSHS, which manages the program, confirmed the group's report. The money would also have no strings attached, meaning lawmakers could spend it any way they want.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Manuel Valdes can be reached at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://twitter.com/manevaldes"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://twitter.com/manevaldes}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110526e75q00019\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) - The Washington state Legislature has approved changes to the state's health care program for poor kids, allowing a raise in premiums for undocumented children to keep them enrolled.\par \par \uc2 Gov. Chris Gregoire initially proposed cutting the 26,000 \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  children enrolled in the program. And an earlier Senate plan would have reduced enrollment as well. About 530,000 total children are covered.\par \par \uc2 Under the proposal approved unanimously in the Senate on Wednesday, families of those children will pay higher monthly premiums to stay in the program.\par \par \uc2 In dire budget cuts, children's health advocates were pleased with the results. Children's Alliance deputy director Jon Gould says that this way all children, no matter their legal status, will have access to health care.\par \par \uc2 Democratic Sen. Steve Hobbs of Lake Stevens says that by maintaining the program the state protects the "most vulnerable."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110525e75p004cu\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) - The South Carolina House approved a bill Tuesday requiring law enforcement to try to check the status of people they suspect are in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 The House voted 69-43 to give the key second reading. The measure requires another perfunctory vote before returning to the Senate, which passed a different version.\par \par \uc2 Republicans who control both the House and Senate have called the bill a top priority for the year.\par \par \uc2 "It has become abundantly clear that if we want something done about illegal immigration, we're going to have to do it ourselves," said House Speaker Bobby Harrell, R-Charleston. "If the federal government refuses to enforce these laws, the South Carolina General Assembly will support state laws that do -- and over the past several years, that is exactly what your state lawmakers have done."\par \par \uc2 The bill specifies that the check must follow a stop or arrest for something else. Someone with a valid driver's license, military ID or passport would be presumed a legal resident.\par \par \uc2 Unlike a law passed in Arizona last year, the South Carolina proposal says people can't be held on the suspicion of being an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Opponents argued it flies in the face of American freedoms.\par \par \uc2 Though the proposal specifies that suspicion can't be based on race, color or national origin, opponents contend that clause is meaningless. They argue the undefined "reasonable suspicion" clause will lead to abuse, turning the innocent-until-proven-guilty protection on its head and inviting lawsuits.\par \par \uc2 "There's no way this bill works without racial profiling," said Rep. David Mack, D-North Charleston. "This is not needed. I believe it's racist, it's mean and it's punitive."\par \par \uc2 The measure would also make it a felony to make fake photo IDs for illegal immigrants, and it creates a new law enforcement unit within the Department of Public Safety to enforce the state's immigration law. The Senate put $1.3 million toward that unit in its proposed budget for 2011-12, which it passed Tuesday and returned to the House.\par \par \uc2 Opponents said it will also cost local governments.\par \par \uc2 Rep. Bakari Sellers, D-Denmark, mocked Republicans by suggesting the bill require a fence -- at least 15 feet high -- along the state's borders that could be painted red, white and blue. Legislators quickly shot down his proposed amendment.\par \par \uc2 The measure would also toughen a measure passed in 2008 that put the onus on businesses to check their employees' legal status. That law, considered one of the toughest in the nation when passed, began applying to businesses of all sizes last year.\par \par \uc2 The latest measure would let the state's labor agency fine businesses up to $50,000 for repeatedly violating the law and refusing to comply with a temporary shut-down order.\par \par \uc2 Roan Garcia-Quintana, who heads an organization called Americans Have Had Enough, said the measure is about jobs in a state struggling for years with high unemployment. He said it's important to target the businesses that hire illegal workers.\par \par \uc2 "Maybe some jobs will open up. They will self-deport if we make it so they're not welcome and target employers. It's all about greed and selfishness," he said of businesses.\par \par \uc2 The Cuban native immigrated to America in 1961, at age 10, as a political refugee. He said he resents any comparisons to the civil rights movement.\par \par \uc2 "Civil rights was about American citizens. This is not about American citizens or legal immigrants," he said.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110525e75p00066\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

(AP) -- Utility crews were working Monday to restore power to the small town of Reading after it was struck over the weekend by a tornado with estimated winds of up to 165 mph.\par \par \uc2 The storm claimed one life as it moved through a corridor of northeast Kansas, causing extensive damage to Reading, a town of about 250 residents some 50 miles south of Topeka.\par \par \uc2 Sharon Watson, spokeswoman for the Kansas Division of Emergency Management, said crews from \uc2 Westar Energy\uc2  hoped to have electricity restored by the end of the day to 30 percent of the residents. Water and sewer service was out for all residents and no timetable was set for getting the functions restored.\par \par \uc2 Authorities have identified the person killed as 53-year-old Don Chesmore, who was in a mobile home that flipped over. He was taken to a hospital in Emporia, where he was pronounced dead.\par \par \uc2 The storm system brought tornadoes, hail, wind and rain. Watson said damage assessment teams concluded that 110 residences and other private buildings were damaged, with 26 being destroyed and 30 uninhabitable. Some 21 commercial buildings, including the school, were damaged, with 10 destroyed and four deemed uninhabitable.\par \par \uc2 A preliminary damage assessment placed the destruction at more than $2.2 million.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Ex-Kan. AG faces appeals court nomination hearing\par \par \uc2 WICHITA, Kan. (AP) -- Former Kansas Attorney General Steve Six will be questioned by U.S. senators on Tuesday as his nomination to become a federal appeals court judge moves forward amid a backlog of nominees awaiting confirmation by the Senate.\par \par \uc2 His hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee comes two months after President Barack Obama nominated the Democrat to sit on the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Six, a former state judge, began his law career nearly two decades ago as a clerk at the Denver-based court.\par \par \uc2 Kansas' two U.S. senators, Republicans Jerry Moran and Pat Roberts, have remained publicly silent about whether Six would have their support. But Tuesday's hearing would not have been scheduled had there been active opposition from the nominee's home state senators, a committee spokeswoman and experts said Monday.\par \par \uc2 Carl Tobias, a University of Richmond law professor who follows the federal judiciary, said the senators may be waiting to see what kinds of questions come up during the hearing.\par \par \uc2 "It would certainly help if he did have their endorsement," Tobias. "Maybe they are being cautious and wanting to see what turns up in the hearing. I don't think he is particularly controversial."\par \par \uc2 An anti-abortion group issued a statement Monday opposing Six's nomination, though other opposition hasn't been apparent. Six has been praised by attorneys who cite his integrity and legal abilities.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 State pays $219K for Kline discrimination lawsuit\par \par \uc2 TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) -- Lawsuits filed against the administrations of Phill Kline while he served as attorney general and Johnson County district attorney have cost the state of Kansas $748,659 in legal fees and expenses.\par \par \uc2 The Topeka Capital Journal reported Monday that the total includes nearly $220,000 through mid-February to defend Kline's Johnson County District Attorney's administration from a lawsuit alleging sexual discrimination. Senior prosecutor Jacqie Spradling alleged that she was fired from the office in retaliation for her complaints of sexual discrimination.\par \par \uc2 The Spradling case cost the $219,172 in fees and expenses, according to records from the attorney general's office obtained by the Capital-Journal through an open records request.\par \par \uc2 Other legal fees paid by the state to defend Kline administrations include $403,528 in an ongoing ethics case before the Board for Discipline of Attorneys and $125,959 to defend Kline aides Eric Rucker and Stephen Maxwell in their ethics cases.\par \par \uc2 Rucker and Maxwell worked in the Kline administrations while he was attorney general and district attorney.\par \par \uc2 In the Spradling case, attorneys hired by the state have denied any sexual discrimination or retaliation against Spradling. Her dismissal was a "legitimate business decision" according to attorneys with Holbrook and Osborn in Overland Park. That firm also is representing Kline in the ethics case.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Fire destroys longtime Pittsburg businesses\par \par \uc2 PITTSBURG, Kan. (AP) -- Two businesses that operated in downtown Pittsburg for decades are gone, and the owners are uncertain whether they'll try to rebuilding.\par \par \uc2 A massive fire on Saturday destroyed Beitzinger's Hardware and Benelli's Jewelry. The hardware store had been in business since 1934, and the jewelry store since 1947.\par \par \uc2 The cause of the blaze remains under investigation. The owners of both stores told The Morning Sun newspaper they have fire insurance, but they're not sure if they'll rebuild.\par \par \uc2 Pittsburg firefighters battled the flames on their new, 100-feet aerial truck. Fire Chief Scott Crain says crews had installed hoses on the vehicle just one day earlier.\par \par \uc2 The aerial truck replaces an older one that had been in service for 30 years.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Wichita lawyer charged with stealing from veterans\par \par \uc2 WICHITA, Kan. (AP) -- Federal prosecutors have charged a Wichita attorney with embezzling pension benefit checks from veterans.\par \par \uc2 A criminal information filed Monday in U.S. District Court charges Janell Jenkins-Foster with five counts of embezzlement. The 57-year-old Wichita woman was a lawyer appointed to serve as a curator on behalf of the veterans or their estates.\par \par \uc2 She's accused of stealing a total of more than $206,000 from the estates of five veterans.\par \par \uc2 No business or personal telephone number for Jenkins-Foster could be found. Her attorney, Craig Robinson, did not immediately return a call for comment.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 AP Enterprise: States' immigration efforts fizzle\par \par \uc2 MIAMI (AP) -- Nearly every state in the union tried to tackle immigration on its own this year in the absence of any congressional movement on the matter, and more than half considered Arizona-style enforcement measures, up from just six in 2010.\par \par \uc2 But an Associated Press review found that in legislature after legislature, nearly all the most punitive measures failed.\par \par \uc2 What had passed as of Monday mostly reinforced current federal law, though a small number of states actually passed legislation that was helpful to illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Many measures were set aside so lawmakers could focus on pressing budget crises, but immigrants have also developed more sophisticated lobbying efforts, and business owners came out strongly against tougher sanctions. Some worried about losing sources of labor and gaining extra paperwork. Others feared tourism boycotts like the one organized against Arizona.\par \par \uc2 Early in the year, high unemployment, a slew of newly Republican-dominated legislatures and nationwide frustration over the failure by the White House or Congress to address the problem suggested Arizona's law would be copied.\par \par \uc2 That law makes it a state crime for an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  to work, penalizes employers who hire them and encourages local authorities to turn over illegal immigrants to federal authorities, among other measures. An appellate court has blocked provisions that require immigrants carry visa documents and allow police broad leeway to question the immigration status of those they suspect are in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110524e75o001jp\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

Some worried about losing sources of labor and gaining extra paperwork. Others feared tourism boycotts like the one organized against Arizona.\par \par \uc2 Early in the year, high unemployment, a slew of newly Republican-dominated legislatures and nationwide frustration over the failure by the White House or Congress to address the problem suggested Arizona's law would be copied.\par \par \uc2 That law makes it a state crime for an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  to work, penalizes employers who hire them and encourages local authorities to turn over illegal immigrants to federal authorities, among other measures. An appellate court has blocked provisions that require immigrants carry visa documents and allow police broad leeway to question the immigration status of those they suspect are in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Body recovered from central Kansas reservoir\par \par \uc2 MARION, Kan.

(AP) -- A massive tornado that blasted its way across southwestern Missouri on Sunday slammed into this city with cataclysmic force, tearing into a hospital, upending dozens of cars and scrubbing entire neighborhoods to the earth, leaving only a forest of splintered tree trunks behind.\par \par \uc2 An unknown number were killed in Joplin, and officials struggling to communicate without power and cell phone service were leery of putting a hard figure on a death toll they feared would rise after daybreak.\par \par \uc2 Asked about a report that 24 people had died, city spokeswoman Lynn Onstot said grimly that officials were "afraid it may be more. ... Our fear is that's a low number." The Missouri National Guard planned to search for the injured throughout the night.\par \par \uc2 "You see pictures of World War II, the devastation and all that with the bombing. That's really what it looked like," said Kerry Sachetta, the principal of a flattened Joplin High School. "I couldn't even make out the side of the building. It was total devastation in my view. I just couldn't believe what I saw."\par \par \uc2 The same storm system that produced the Joplin tornado spawned twisters along a broad swath of the Midwest, from Oklahoma to Wisconsin. At least one person was killed in Minneapolis. But the devastation in Missouri appeared to be the worst of the day, eerily reminiscent the tornadoes that killed more than 300 people across the South last month.\par \par \uc2 Onstot said the twister -- believed to be between one-half to three-quarters of a mile wide -- was on the ground for nearly four miles. It hit a hospital packed with patients and a commercial area including a \uc2 Home Depot\uc2  construction store, numerous smaller businesses and restaurants and a grocery store. An untold number of homes were destroyed and reduced to ruin.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Tornado kills 1 in Kan., damages hundreds of homes\par \par \uc2 READING, Kan. (AP) -- A tornado swept through a small eastern Kansas town, killing one person and destroying at least 20 homes, as severe thunderstorms pelted the region with hail that some residents described as the size of baseballs, authorities said Sunday.\par \par \uc2 Kansas Division of Emergency Management spokeswoman Sharon Watson identified the victim as Don Chesmore, 53, of Reading. He was in a mobile home that flipped over Saturday night. He was taken to a hospital in Emporia, where he was pronounced dead.\par \par \uc2 Five others were injured but none of those injuries were considered life-threatening, Watson said. She did not have details on their injuries or know whether they all were hospitalized.\par \par \uc2 About 200 homes were damaged in and around the town of about 250 people, Watson said. The local post office and volunteer fire department were damaged, and all roads in and out of the town have been closed off. Reading is about 50 miles south of Topeka. The tornado was reported about 9:15 p.m. Saturday, Watson said.\par \par \uc2 It was classified Sunday as an EF3, with winds ranging up to 165 mph, said National Weather Service meteorologist George Phillips.\par \par \uc2 Fields around the town of Reading were littered with sections of aluminum, insulation and papers. A tractor stood alone in a field, the building that surrounded it demolished. A large board pierced the wall of a home that was missing its roof and windows. A pile of stones was all that was left of another building.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Analysis: Kan. nearing end of state arts funding\par \par \uc2 TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) -- Employees of the Kansas Arts Commission are culling its files, looking for documents to save for the state's historical archives. They're expecting their agency to be history soon, having been notified by Gov. Sam Brownback's administration that all five of them will be laid off June 10.\par \par \uc2 Legislators have defied Brownback's call to eliminate the commission and replace it with a private, nonprofit group, and arts advocates have sent hundreds of emails to state officials. Before lawmakers finished their annual session, they included money for the commission in the budget for the fiscal year that begins July 1.\par \par \uc2 The new Republican governor still can kill the Arts Commission by using his power to veto individual spending items. The agency's only real hope is arts advocates' campaign to save the commission will cause Brownback to back away from his proposal.\par \par \uc2 ----------\par \par \uc2 An AP News Analysis\par \par \uc2 ----------\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Hutchinson police crack down on underage drinking.\par \par \uc2 HUTCHINSON, Kan.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 MIAMI (AP) - Nearly every state in the union tried to tackle immigration on its own this year in the absence of any congressional movement on the matter, and more than half considered Arizona-style enforcement measures, up from just six in 2010.\par \par \uc2 But an Associated Press review found that in legislature after legislature, nearly all the most punitive measures failed.\par \par \uc2 What had passed as of Monday mostly reinforced current federal law, though a small number of states actually passed legislation that was helpful to illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Many measures were set aside so lawmakers could focus on pressing budget crises, but immigrants have also developed more sophisticated lobbying efforts, and business owners came out strongly against tougher sanctions. Some worried about losing sources of labor and gaining extra paperwork. Others feared tourism boycotts like the one organized against Arizona.\par \par \uc2 Early in the year, high unemployment, a slew of newly Republican-dominated legislatures and nationwide frustration over the failure by the White House or Congress to address the problem suggested Arizona's law would be copied.\par \par \uc2 That law makes it a state crime for an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  to work, penalizes employers who hire them and encourages local authorities to turn over illegal immigrants to federal authorities, among other measures. An appellate court has blocked provisions that require immigrants carry visa documents and allow police broad leeway to question the immigration status of those they suspect are in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 Louisiana State Rep. Joe Harrison, a Republican, said federal inaction prompted his interest in state laws on immigration.\par \par \uc2 "I'm just trying to give them a little Taser move in the right direction," he said.\par \par \uc2 But Harrison's bill has yet to move out of committee, and most of the others failed, as did most of the proposals requiring businesses to use the federal government's electronic E-verify system to check the eligibility of new hires. Only a few states made any serious attempt to crack down on employers.\par \par \uc2 So far, only Georgia and Utah have passed comprehensive bills. South Carolina and Alabama are still considering them. Utah's law includes a provision to allow illegal immigrants to work in the state, and the American Civil Liberties Union has already sued Utah over the law's enforcement provisions.\par \par \uc2 Georgia was the shining example for those hoping to step up enforcement and the closest to Arizona. Its new law allows local officers to check the immigration status of a suspect who can't produce an accepted form of ID. It also includes a provision requiring employers with more than 10 employees to use E-Verify by July 2013, similar to a 2007 law Arizona. Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal signed the bill earlier this month and opponents say they plan to sue the state.\par \par \uc2 Following the failure of the recent Dream Act in Washington -- which would have provided a path to legalization for qualified \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students and other young adults -- several states adopted legislation this session that helps \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students. Maryland approved in-state college tuition for illegal immigrants, Illinois is likely to set up a private scholarship fund for them, and Connecticut expanded in-state tuition for graduate school. An in-state tuition bill in Oregon passed the Senate but has yet to reach the House floor.\par \par \uc2 Arizona lawmakers ordered school districts to report students' residency, but that was geared toward keeping children who live across the Mexican border from enrolling in Arizona schools.\par \par \uc2 Only Indiana passed a law to prohibit in-state tuition for those in the country illegally, a largely symbolic move.\par \par \uc2 Most legislation never gets out of committee, and compromise is always key.\par \par \uc2 But experts on both sides credit businesses for much of the legislations' failure.\par \par \uc2 "Business owners came out of the woodwork in a way they hadn't done before," said Tamar Jacoby, president of ImmigrationWorks USA, a national federation of mostly small-business owners who support immigration reform.\par \par \uc2 Many Florida businesses said they feared the economic damage that would be caused if the state were hit by a tourism boycott like the one immigrant rights groups organized against Arizona.\par \par \uc2 In Arizona, 60 top executives signed a letter to Arizona's Senate president, asking for a moratorium on immigration bills.\par \par \uc2 Indianapolis-based drug maker \uc2 Eli Lilly\uc2  was among those who publicly opposed an Arizona-style bill. Last week, Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels signed into law more modest bills: the in-state tuition ban and an end to tax credits for companies that hire illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 In Utah, businesses helped create the Utah Compact, the basis for the most comprehensive immigration law to come out of the states. It resembles Arizona on enforcement but allows illegal immigrants to work in Utah. A judge blocked the bill last week, following the ACLU lawsuit.\par \par \uc2 Jacoby acknowledged many businesses particularly opposed E-verify.\par \par \uc2 Indeed, in Florida, the House and Senate couldn't reach a compromise on the E-verify component, and the proposals died. The Indiana and Alabama legislatures faced similar splits between their House and Senate over measures targeting employers.\par \par \uc2 Jacoby said it was the Arizona-like enforcement sections of the bills that generated the attention and public debate, and that in many states, E-verify went down along with them.\par \par \uc2 Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates stricter limits on immigration, believes many businesses concerned about E-verify cynically stoked opposition to the bills by emphasizing the enforcement angle.\par \par \uc2 "The businesses community really did pull out all the stops on this, and I have to give them props," Krikorian said. "The strategy was to make a big deal about Arizona-style legislation in order to scare off E-verify."\par \par \uc2 Immigrants and their supporters were also ready to battle, capitalizing on networks they developed in recent years in response to Arizona's law and the federal government's stepped-up deportation efforts.\par \par \uc2 In Florida, farmworkers, students and other immigrants and activists spent weeks at the Capitol, protesting and praying during committee hearings but also lobbying heavily behind the scenes.\par \par \uc2 In Kansas, they quickly spread a \uc2 YouTube\uc2  clip of Republican State Rep. Virgil Peck likening illegal immigrants to feral hogs, generating a swift backlash nationwide that helped doom bills there.\par \par \uc2 The progressive Latino group Democracia USA took out ads against proposals in Colorado, Pennsylvania and Florida. President Jorge Mursuli said backers of some state bills couldn't answer basic questions about the legislation, such as whether families hiring nannies would have to use E-verify, or whether employers would be on the hook for unemployment insurance for new hires found ineligible to work.\par \par \uc2 "A lot of folks were doing this as a political stunt, rather than as a real policy effort," he said.\par \par \uc2 Still, those itching for action in Washington may get their wish. Immigration groups and those who support enforcement-only measures say they will redouble lobbying efforts at the federal level. Last week, Democratic senators in Washington reintroduced the Dream Act, though it's unlikely to pass the Republican-led House, and certainly not before the 2012 election.\par \par \uc2 President Barack Obama also gave his second speech in two weeks on immigration.\par \par \uc2 Krikorian noted the Supreme Court will soon rule on the constitutionality of a 2007 Arizona law that mandated all companies there use E-verify. If that law is upheld, he believes other states will again follow Arizona's lead.\par \par \uc2 "Then the game isn't over," he said.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writers Josh Loftin in Salt Lake City, Kate Brumback in Atlanta, Ken Kusmer in Indianapolis, Molly Davis in Baton Rouge, La., and Roger Alford in Frankfort, Ky., contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110523e75n000xf\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) - A former Anchorage police officer accused of being an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  living under a stolen identity plans to plead guilty to federal charges, according to court documents.\par \par \uc2 Mexico-born Rafael Mora-Lopez, who lived for more than two decades in Alaska as Rafael Espinoza, said in court papers he will plead guilty to charges of passport fraud and false claim of U.S. citizenship.\par \par \uc2 The documents filed Thursday say the real Rafael Espinoza is a legal U.S. citizen. Authorities say he also holds citizenship in another unspecified country.\par \par \uc2 Mora-Lopez, 47, worked as a well-regarded police officer for six years until his arrest in April. He initially pleaded not guilty to passport fraud and has been out on bail under home confinement and electronic monitoring.\par \par \uc2 He has declined to comment. His attorney, Allen Dayan, did not immediately respond Monday to a telephone call seeking comment.\par \par \uc2 The court papers say Mora-Lopez's wife, Margarita Cynthia Espinoza, had been a neighbor of the real Espinoza in Guadalajara, Mexico, in the 1980s. But it's not clear how the identity was obtained, Assistant U.S. Attorney Frank Russo said.\par \par \uc2 Mora-Lopez used Espinoza's name, Social Security number and date of birth to apply for an Alaska driver's license in June 1989, presenting a birth certificate and Social Security card as evidence of his identity, the court papers say.\par \par \uc2 Mora-Lopez repeatedly used the assumed identity to vote in local and national elections and receive over the years more than $27,000 in dividends issued to Alaska residents out of investment profits from the \uc2 Alaska Permanent Fund\uc2 , the documents state.\par \par \uc2 State prosecutors did not immediately respond to a call asking if the state was pursuing the dividend payouts.\par \par \uc2 According to the court papers, Mora-Lopez used the false citizenship and identity to bring his future wife to Alaska and help her obtain naturalization as a U.S. citizen "based on her marriage to him as a citizen." Authorities have said the couple has a child.\par \par \uc2 Mora-Lopez's true identity was discovered after he applied for a passport renewal and the State Department noted someone else appeared to have a passport under the same identity, according to the plea filing. Police and federal authorities say neither Espinoza nor Mora-Lopez have any known criminal records, so a pre-employment criminal background check on Mora-Lopez turned up empty. He also passed a polygraph test.\par \par \uc2 A court hearing was scheduled for June 1.\par \par \uc2 Mora-Lopez could face as much as 13 years in prison, Russo said.\par \par \uc2 The former officer's arrest leaves the Police Department juggling various complications, such as potential challenges to Mora-Lopez's testimony in past criminal trials and pension earned under the identity.\par \par \uc2 The case is similar to one involving a Mexican national who took the identity of a dead cousin who was a U.S. citizen in order to become a Milwaukee police officer. The man was deported to Mexico in 2007.\par \par \uc2 Mora-Lopez's arrest came two months after another Anchorage police officer, Anthony Rollins, was convicted of sexually assaulting women while on duty.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110523e75n002de\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHOENIX (AP) - Angelica Hernandez excelled in high school and did just as well in college, graduating earlier this month as the distinguished graduating senior in mechanical engineering at Arizona State University.\par \par \uc2 But Hernandez won't have much of a chance to excel as an engineer, despite a recovery in the jobs market for the sought-after professionals.\par \par \uc2 That's because Hernandez is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  and can't legally work. The 21-year-old Mexican native crossed the Arizona desert with her mother and sister when she was just 9. Her father was already in Phoenix and her mother wanted her girls to be with him.\par \par \uc2 Hernandez started school here as a 4th grader at Mitchell Elementary School in Phoenix, and by the time she transferred to Pueblo Del Sol Middle School as a 6th grader she no longer needed to take English as a second language courses. Then at Carl Hayden High School, she became fully immersed as an American, participating in cross country, track and soccer, serving as the National Honors Society president and joining the junior ROTC and the robotics team.\par \par \uc2 All the while she knew her immigration status was an issue. Named 2007 Outstanding Young Woman of the Year for District 7 in Phoenix, she attended a luncheon at which Mayor Phil Gordon presided.\par \par \uc2 "It was kind of ironic in a sense," Hernandez said. "Because, you know, I was up there with the mayor and other students from other high schools and I was undocumented, but I was still up there with everyone else."\par \par \uc2 The robotics team focused her on engineering, and with a presidential scholarship to ASU, she prepared to start college.\par \par \uc2 Then Arizona's push to crack down on illegal immigrants hit her hard. Proposition 300, approved by 71 percent of the state's voters in November 2006, barred undocumented students from receiving any state financial aid and forced them to pay out-of-state tuition rates that were triple in-state rates. And she lost her scholarship. Federal aid already was barred to illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 "So that scholarship got taken away and that's when everything started falling apart in a sense, because I wasn't sure how I was going to be able to pay for everything," Hernandez said. "I was counting on that scholarship."\par \par \uc2 She managed to get private funding for her tuition.\par \par \uc2 "So I was able to finish my first year, and every year after that it was kind of uncertain as far as money but I was able to get private funding in order to pay," she said.\par \par \uc2 Immigrants like Hernandez who were brought here as children have virtually no chance of earning legal status under current federal immigration laws. Because she's been here for more than a year, a 1996 immigration law requires her to return to Mexico for a decade before she would be eligible for a visa, and even then there is no assurance she would be awarded one.\par \par \uc2 "So we're kind of just stuck here, in limbo, not being able to work, not being able to apply for anything, because there's currently no way for us to become legalized," she said.\par \par \uc2 There are tens of thousands of high school and college students who fall into the same category every year, said Adey Fisseha, a policy attorney for the National Immigration Law Center, which advocates for the rights of immigrants. "I think at a time when we're really looking forward and trying to think about investments in education and in our future workforce, this is certainly a population of homegrown talent that we're kind of throwing by the wayside."\par \par \uc2 The only hope for young immigrants like Hernandez who were brought here as children is the so-called DREAM Act, which would give a path to legal status for law-abiding young people who either attend college or join the military. As a degree-holder, Hernandez would immediately meet the qualifications.\par \par \uc2 Considered a scaled-down effort because comprehensive immigrant reform is widely considered politically impossible, the law was introduced in the U.S. Senate earlier this month. Similar legislation has failed in Congress several times before, most recently in December.\par \par \uc2 The plight of immigrants like Hernandez has strong support among Democrats, and even from some tough-on-illegal immigration Republican Arizona lawmakers.\par \par \uc2 "If you're talking about people brought here as children by their parents who don't have serious criminal records, I don't have a problem because I think it would be cruel to eject them from the country to a `homeland' that they know little of and might not even speak the language," said Rep. John Kavanagh, R-Fountain Hills, who has pushed for tough state laws targeting illegal immigrants. "But, I would never let their parents stay, because those are the people who created the problem in the first place."\par \par \uc2 Kavanagh is concerned that the proposed law could end up much broader than originally advertised, thought, and he said securing the border must happen first.\par \par \uc2 For Hernandez, who has now moved back in with her mother, there's little hope of a quick change. Her year-old sister is in the same position, graduating from ASU this spring with a degree in sociology and psychology.\par \par \uc2 "The only choice right would be to go on to grad school," she said. "For us `dreamers,' that's how we like to call each other, we know that the only solution that we have it to continue our education."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110522e75m003gc\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

Fliers on a Mexican storefront advertise free transportation for workers willing to pick jalapenos and banana peppers in Florida and blueberries in the Carolinas. Buying an outbound bus ticket now requires reservations.\par \par \uc2 Illegal immigrants and their families who harvest southeast Georgia's trademarked sweet onions are considering leaving rather than risk deportation in the wake of a law signed by Gov. Nathan Deal targeting illegal workers.\par \par \uc2 While most states rejected immigration crackdowns this year, conservative Georgia and Utah are the only states where comprehensive bills have passed. With the ink barely dry on Georgia's law, among the toughest in the country, the divisions between suburban voters and those in the countryside are once again laid bare when it comes to immigration, even among people who line up on many other issues.\par \par \uc2 Sandra Almanza, 20, cried behind the counter of her mother's store, La Michoacana, at the thought of leaving to protect her husband, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Mexico City and the father of her unborn daughter. The couple was finishing the nursery.\par \par \uc2 "We just finished painting her room, but we don't know how long we'll stay there," said Almanza, a U.S. citizen whose parents originally came to Lyons years ago to work in the onion fields. Their store sells phone cards to migrant laborers and wires their money back home. "We really don't have that many options."\par \par \uc2 The crackdown proved popular in suburban Atlanta, where Spanish-only signs proliferate and the Latino population has risen dramatically over the past few decades. Residents complain that illegal immigrants take their jobs and strain public resources.\par \par \uc2 "The citizens of Georgia demanded action," said Republican Rep. Matt Ramsey, the bill's sponsor, who lives about 30 miles southwest of Atlanta. "They let their legislators know that this was an issue they wanted to see addressed."\par \par \uc2 The new law penalizes people who harbor or transport illegal immigrants in some situations and allows law enforcement officers to check the immigration status of suspects who can't show an approved form of identification. Using false documents to get a job will be a felony once the law goes into effect in July.\par \par \uc2 Private employers with more than 10 workers must eventually use a federal database called E-Verify to check the immigration status of new hires. That doesn't sit well with farmers or many of their illegal laborers.\par \par \uc2 Drive three hours from Atlanta into vegetable country -- also a right-leaning region -- and many oppose the law out of fear it will drive out the workers, legal and illegal, who stoop to pull up the Vidalia onions and other produce that make Georgia farming famous.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 There's no easy way to harvest an onion.\par \par \uc2 Mechanized threshers and reapers can pluck cotton, peanuts, corn and wheat from the earth. Machines shake pecans from trees and sweep them up. But easily bruised fruits and vegetables require hands-and-knees labor for planting and harvesting.\par \par \uc2 On a dusty field near Lyons, clusters of Latino fieldworkers hunched over onion beds, snipping green stalks from onion bulbs in 90-degree heat. They placed the bulbs in a red plastic bucket. Each full bucket tipped into a truck earns workers 38 cents.\par \par \uc2 A good worker might fill 300 buckets daily, earning just more than $100. Legal workers brought in on temporary work visas get better pay.\par \par \uc2 They sweat through long-sleeve shirts, jeans, bandannas and hats worn to shield them from the sun. A thin layer of gray-brown dust kicked up from the field quickly settles in the nostrils and sticks to the skin.\par \par \uc2 Alfredo Perez said he arrived illegally from Mexico three years ago. He travels between Florida, Michigan and Georgia picking crops.\par \par \uc2 "I think this law is difficult because they don't want to let us work here. We're not delinquents," he said. "We usually come here during onion season, but because of the law, we're going to have to think about whether or not we'll come back."\par \par \uc2 Authorities face a decision on how strictly to enforce parts of the law.\par \par \uc2 Toombs County Sheriff Alvie Lee Kight Jr. knows the dilemma well. He's responsible for patrolling the area. His family also grows Vidalia onions. Prominent famers want him to show leniency. An elected official, he may well face pressure from voters to target illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 He's sympathetic to many sides of the debate. Kight said his family farm has at times been unable to get visas for temporary field workers, forcing it to hire local labor. That comes with the risk of employing illegal immigrants. As long as workers present what appear to be legitimate documents, employers cannot delve deeper into their immigration status.\par \par \uc2 He supports tightening border security to stanch the flow of illegal immigrants. Then, Kight said, the country must address the illegal immigrants already here. He didn't know how to solve the problem, but he felt the country could ease the barriers to bringing in legal workers.\par \par \uc2 "We shouldn't have illegals here," he said. "But I also think it should be a workable solution. We need them here to work, but we want them to be legal."\par \par \uc2 Onion farmers fear losing their workers, legal or not.\par \par \uc2 Delbert Bland\uc2  owns \uc2 Bland Farms\uc2 , one of the biggest sweet onion growers in the country. He and his father started with five acres in 1983. The international operation is now approaching $100 million in sales.\par \par \uc2 Rather than rely on local hires, Bland's farm has enrolled in a federal guest worker program and brings in as many as 350 workers from Mexico for the spring onion harvest. The company must pay for their travel, housing and utilities, and pay above-market wages. Bland considers it worth the cost when compared to the losses he could suffer if there's a labor shortage during the harvest from April to June.\par \par \uc2 If local police step up enforcement, Bland predicted it could have a chilling effect on all immigrant workers.\par \par \uc2 He recently called the local sheriff's office to complain about a motorcyclist who had repeatedly sped past his plant. When deputies arrived to stake out the speeder, it triggered a panic among the workers, one of whom came to talk to him.\par \par \uc2 "He comes in here and he's as white as a ghost. And he says, `Mr. Delbert, there's somebody out there, the police is out there. What are we going to do?' And the guy's legal," Bland said.\par \par \uc2 Bland's chief operating officer, \uc2 Michael Hively\uc2 , called the immigration crackdown a political distraction.\par \par \uc2 "It took the focus off a lot of issues that are more important," Hively said.\par \par \uc2 Farmer R.T. Stanley Jr. of Stanley Farms grows roughly 1,200 acres of onions. Some of his workers arrive with temporary agriculture visas, while others are hired locally. While those workers must present paperwork showing they are here legally, Stanley acknowledged some of it could be fake.\par \par \uc2 He scoffs at the idea of U.S. citizens doing the work.\par \par \uc2 "I hire locals usually the first of the season," he said. "They come out and act like they really want to work. You know how long they stay? Two hours. They say this work's too hard."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 When immigrant workers arrive in town, they often knock at the door of the Southeast Georgia Communities Project in Lyons, which operates a food bank, distributes clothing and hosts English classes. Its executive director, Andrea Hinojosa, serves as a go-between for Spanish-speaking migrants and the English-speaking world around them.\par \par \uc2 She said it's popular for whites to say they want illegal immigrants gone. Yet they also profit from their presence. Acting on Hinojosa's advice, the local \uc2 Wal-Mart\uc2  stocked up on beef tongue and tripe to increase sales to Latino workers.\par \par \uc2 "They leave thousands and thousands of dollars locally," she said of the workers.\par \par \uc2 Hinojosa gets phone calls from whites seeking cheap labor, for example, for help with yard work or cleaning.\par \par \uc2 "These are people who, I know, would not vote for some type of work visas," she said.\par \par \uc2 Few are certain what will happen to the area once the law fully takes effect, but some consequences are already being felt. Almanza predicts her mother's store will close if its Latino clientele leaves. Having lived most of her life in a town of roughly 4,000 people, she rules out going to Mexico City to protect her husband.\par \par \uc2 "You don't know anybody," she said. "It's a large city, you could easily get lost and, you know, I don't think I could stay there."\par \par \uc2 Stanley said that if the E-Verify system disqualifies large parts of his workforce, it could spell disaster for the business.\par \par \uc2 "It could shut me down, I don't know," Stanley said. "Got to wait and see."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110520e75k0013f\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

House shoots down immigration bill; author says measure won't be heard again this year\b0\par\par\uc2 By SEAN MURPHY   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 610 \uc2 words\par \uc2 17 May 2011\par 21:43\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2011.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) - Facing opposition from both sides of the aisle, the House author of a plan to target illegal immigration in Oklahoma said Tuesday the bill won't be reconsidered this year after the Republican-controlled House shot down the latest version of the measure.\par \par \uc2 With some Republicans complaining it did nothing to target employers and some Democrats arguing immigration law must be addressed at the federal level, the House voted 62-31 Tuesday against adopting the bill that focused mostly on human smugglers and others who prey on illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 "We talked to law enforcement, and this is what they said they wanted," said Rep. George Faught, R-Muskogee, the House author of the bill. "The bill is laid over, so it pretty much won't be heard this year. Obviously I'm disappointed, but it is what is."\par \par \uc2 Illegal immigration has been a tricky issue for Republicans, many of whom campaigned in November for cracking down on illegal immigrants when the GOP swept to power by extending their majorities in the House and Senate and capturing the governor's office. But the push against illegal immigrants has collided with another Republican priority -- creating a pro-business environment -- and business and industry leaders have quietly resisted attempts to add more restrictions on the hiring of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  workers.\par \par \uc2 Legislative leaders attempted to appease both sides by creating a special committee on illegal immigration that focused on the public safety implications, and Faught's bill emerged last week with an emphasis on human smuggling. The measure authorized state and local law enforcement to recommend illegal immigrants for certain types of visas if they report and aid in the investigation of illegal criminal activity.\par \par \uc2 "There's no doubt about it -- this bill is a backdoor amnesty," said Rep. Eric Proctor, D-Tulsa. "This is a yes vote for amnesty."\par \par \uc2 Other provisions of the bill allowed the seizure of vehicles used to smuggle humans and directed the Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics to be the primary investigative agency for human trafficking or human smuggling. It also authorized the Council on Law Enforcement Education and Training to develop an illegal immigration curriculum for local law enforcement officers.\par \par \uc2 But hard-line critics of illegal immigration wanted the bill to go much further and allow for the seizure of vehicles and property used to commit any immigration-related crime, including harboring or transporting illegal aliens.\par \par \uc2 More than a half dozen bills on illegal immigration were introduced this session, targeting everything from employers who hire illegal workers to the elimination of Oklahoma citizenship for children born to \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  parents, but all of those bills were bottled up by House leaders, and only Faught's bill was kept alive.\par \par \uc2 Rep. Randy Terrill, R-Moore, who wrote a bill three years ago that was billed at the time as one of the toughest anti-illegal immigration bills in the country, called Faught's measure a "worthless piece of garbage."\par \par \uc2 "This isn't an anti-illegal immigration bill," Terrill said. "It doesn't add much, if anything, to current law."\par \par \uc2 Oklahoma's Hispanic population has shown steady gains in recent years. More than 17 percent of the 580,000 residents of Oklahoma City, the state's largest city, now identify themselves as being of Hispanic descent. In Tulsa, the state's second-largest city, 14 percent of its 392,000 residents say they are Hispanic, according to the latest data from the U.S. Census Bureau. Lawton and Enid also recorded significant concentrations of Hispanic residents.\par \par \uc2 5\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110518e75i0000t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 AUSTIN, Texas (AP) - Hispanic lawmakers in the Texas Senate are bracing for a bitter fight over one of the session's flashpoint immigration issues: the so-called sanctuary cities bill that one legislator called a "hate-mongering" and racist measure.\par \par \uc2 The bill would give most police officers the right to question detained people about their immigration status, and prohibit cities from adopting policies that ban the practice. None of Texas' major cities claim to be sanctuary cities, but many police departments discourage their officers from asking about immigration status.\par \par \uc2 Supporters, including Republican Gov. Rick Perry, say the bill is needed to stop crime committed by illegal immigrants. Critics say it would lead to racial profiling and allow police to harass Latinos.\par \par \uc2 A Senate hearing on the bill is scheduled Wednesday in the Committee on Transportation and Homeland Security.\par \par \uc2 Hispanic lawmakers in the Senate, all of them Democrats, predict that a floor vote sometime in the next few days could be one of the chamber's most divisive and emotional in recent memory.\par \par \uc2 "Why don't they just have a law to bring out the German Shepherds, bring out the fire hose," said Sen. Mario Gallegos of Houston. "Let's go back to the Jim Crow days. Why don't they just put that in there? Let's go. Let's get it on. That sanctuary cities bill is the most hate-mongering, racial bill that I've ever seen out there."\par \par \uc2 Perry spokeswoman Katherine Cesinger said the bill only gives police the option to ask about immigration status.\par \par \uc2 "Without that discretion, they don't have the tools to do their jobs effectively and to keep our communities safe from those who would do us harm," Cesinger said.\par \par \uc2 Sen. Leticia Van de Putte of San Antonio, leader of the Senate Democrats, says several Hispanic lawmakers have family histories that stir up strong emotions about the bill:\par \par \uc2 --Van de Putte's grandmother fled a revolution in Mexico as a child and never became a U.S. citizen.\par \par \uc2 --U.S.-born Sen. Juan "Chuy" Hinojosa was 5 when he and his mother, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Mexico, were picked up by the border patrol in a tomato field, driven across the border and left there. They lived in a small room off the back of a bar for a year in Reynosa, Mexico.\par \par \uc2 "It's something I'll never forget, being placed in the paddy wagon," Hinojosa said.\par \par \uc2 --Sen. Jose Rodriguez of El Paso, worked alongside \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  farm workers while growing up and used to shout warnings when border patrol agents were spotted.\par \par \uc2 --Rep. Ana Hernandez Luna of Houston gave an emotional speech on the House floor this month about how she and her family lived in fear they would be found out and deported before she became a U.S. citizen at age 18.\par \par \uc2 Hinojosa said he could be a target for an immigration check if stopped by police.\par \par \uc2 "I was born and raised in this country. I pledge allegiance to this country. I graduated from school, law school, volunteered for the Marine Corps and fought in Vietnam," Hinojosa said. "This is such an insult to Hispanics, not only in this state but this country."\par \par \uc2 An estimated 1.6 million illegal immigrants are in Texas, according to the Pew Hispanic Center in Washington. Nationwide, their numbers declined between 2007 and 2009, from 12 million to 11.1 million, the first significant drop after two decades of growth. But their combined population in Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana went up by a statistically significant 240,000.\par \par \uc2 In an early sign of just how heated the debate in the Senate could get, an amendment was introduced last week to prevent students who are illegal immigrants and who graduate from Texas high schools from paying cheaper in-state tuition rates to public universities.\par \par \uc2 Van de Putte and Sen. Eddie Lucio of Brownsville angrily argued against the measure. It was pulled down without a vote when it became clear it did not have the support of several key Republicans.\par \par \uc2 Gallegos and Van de Putte acknowledge they may not be able to stop the sanctuary cities bill, with Republicans holding a 19-11 Senate majority.\par \par \uc2 In the House, the bill passed after the Republican majority used a parliamentary maneuver to cut off racially charged debate.\par \par \uc2 Senate Democrats have a couple of rules working in their favor. Although outnumbered, they effectively have the votes to prevent the bill from coming to the floor for a vote under normal procedures.\par \par \uc2 But two weeks ago, Senate Republicans used a little-known rule to pass a House budget bill without getting the two-thirds support they normally need. Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, a Republican, has said the rule could be used again.\par \par \uc2 Such a move on the sanctuary cities bill "will damage lifelong friendships" in the Senate, Van de Putte said.\par \par \uc2 With legislative deadlines looming before the May 30 end of the session, Democrats could try to filibuster the sanctuary cities bill, but that could take down hundreds of other bills as well. Van de Putte said Democrats haven't talked about a filibuster. And she said Democrats aren't considering leaving the state to break a quorum like they did in 2003 to stop a congressional redistricting bill.\par \par \uc2 But any debate on the sanctuary cities bill in the coming days is likely to be divisive.\par \par \uc2 "What you're going to see is that with Hispanics, it's personal," Van de Putte said.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110517e75h00336\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 MABLETON, Ga. (AP) - About 100 students walked out of class at a suburban Atlanta high school on Tuesday, protesting Georgia's new law cracking down on illegal immigration and a new Georgia university system policy that effectively bars \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students from the five most competitive state colleges and universities.\par \par \uc2 The students at Pebblebrook High School in Mableton left class at 2 p.m. and rallied outside the school. Several \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students shared their stories and some other students expressed their support for their \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  friends.\par \par \uc2 "I feel like doing something like this raises awareness and also shows our voices," said Dulce Guerrero, a senior who was brought to the U.S. illegally when she was 2 years old. "I'm here to give all undocumented students a face."\par \par \uc2 It wasn't immediately clear if the students would face any penalty for walking out of class. A woman who answered the phone at the school said the administration had no comment and a spokesman for the Cobb County School District did not immediately return a call seeking comment.\par \par \uc2 Georgia's new law would authorize law enforcement officers to check the immigration status of certain suspects and would penalize people who transport or harbor illegal immigrants in certain circumstances. It also would require many employers to check the immigration status of new hires.\par \par \uc2 The Georgia university system implemented a new policy last year that would bar any school that had rejected an academically qualified applicant in the previous two year from accepting illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 The students called May 17 a symbolic day because that was the day in 1954 that the Supreme Court handed down a decision that declared segregated schools unconstitutional.\par \par \uc2 The Rev. Timothy McDonald, a civil rights activist, addressed the students gathered outside the school. He is a former staff member of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, the organization founded by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. that led the movement for equality and justice for blacks.\par \par \uc2 "There is no doubt in my mind that if Dr. King were alive today, he would be here," McDonald said. "I am a firm believer that immigration is the 21st century civil rights issue and we will win."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110517e75h0032z\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc86}{\*\bkmkend toc86}\b \uc2 As states tweak and pass immigration laws, question becomes: Will they ever be constitutional?\b0\par\par\uc2 By JOSH LOFTIN   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 1,132 \uc2 words\par \uc2 13 May 2011\par 14:12\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2011.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SALT LAKE CITY (AP) - Utah legislators passed an immigration law that they were confident wouldn't end up the same way Arizona's version did last year: tangled up in the courts.\par \par \uc2 But 14 hours after Utah's law went into effect this week, it, too, was before a federal judge.\par \par \uc2 As the case goes through the courts, other states grappling with illegal immigration are paying close attention. In Georgia, Gov. Nathan Deal signed a comprehensive immigration bill Friday that includes an enforcement measure very similar to Utah's version. Most parts of the law are effective July 1.\par \par \uc2 Alabama has one, too, and it is moving close to passage in the Legislature.\par \par \uc2 The halting of Utah's law could cause them concern. After all, state lawmakers worked at length with attorneys to try to eliminate constitutional issues a federal judge raised with Arizona's law.\par \par \uc2 Despite those refinements, the bottom line remains the same, legal scholars say. Immigration is enforced by the federal government, and any state attempting to tell the federal government how to enforce immigration laws is stepping into potentially unconstitutional territory.\par \par \uc2 So far, courts have agreed with that assessment. The hold placed on parts of Arizona's law by a district court judge was upheld in April by a three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, and earlier this week Gov. Jan Brewer said she plans to appeal the rulings to the U.S. Supreme Court.\par \par \uc2 "The main reason the Arizona statute is bad is because it's the state taking over immigration law," said Arizona State University law professor Paul Bender. "The Utah law is unconstitutional for the same reason."\par \par \uc2 While Utah's law may still be overturned because it usurps federal authority, the state did narrow its law significantly and made it not as "blatantly unconstitutional" by trying to fix two other issues the courts have taken with Arizona's law, Bender said.\par \par \uc2 One change made by Utah and Georgia was the elimination of a clause found in the Arizona law that would compel police to check the citizenship status of anyone who they have "reasonable suspicion" to believe is in the country illegally -- whether a crime has been committed or not. Because police would have been forced to determine immediately whether a person was potentially illegal, racial profiling was almost guaranteed, Bender said.\par \par \uc2 Alabama's proposed law contains the reasonable suspicion clause, but state Sen. Scott Beason, R-Gardendale, has maintained the bill is constitutionally sound.\par \par \uc2 Utah police will be required to check the citizenship status of anyone arrested for a major crime. For minor offenses, such as traffic violations, the police can check at their discretion, but only if the person stopped doesn't have valid identification.\par \par \uc2 Georgia police will be given the power to check citizenship for all state offenses, but not required unless a person is booked into jail.\par \par \uc2 Another change both states made was focusing enforcement on people committing a crime, instead of the Arizona approach that allowed police to check almost anyone they legally encounter, Bender said.\par \par \uc2 When coupled with a program beginning in 2013 that will allow illegal immigrants with jobs to live and work in the state, Utah finds itself cast as the considerate northern neighbor to Arizona.\par \par \uc2 Protests in Utah have been minor. The death threats and widespread boycotts that followed the passage of Arizona's law in 2010 are non-existent. Georgia, on the other hand, has seen multiple protests with thousands of people participating and national groups are threatening boycotts, despite the two laws being almost identical.\par \par \uc2 Utah lawmakers credit their public relations success to the Utah Compact, a set of principles drafted by religious and business leaders.\par \par \uc2 Supporters of Utah's overhaul package claim it uses the compact's ideals to balance compassion and enforcement. Most of the criticism of the package has focused on the guest worker program, which opponents describe as amnesty.\par \par \uc2 But the missing outrage in Utah doesn't diminish the constitutional hurdles, especially since the federal ruling on Arizona's law focused on federal control of immigration.\par \par \uc2 "We understand the desire of the defendants to distance themselves from the Arizona law," said Karen Tumlin, managing attorney for the National Immigration Law Center, who sued the state along with the American Civil Liberties Union. "But if you read the text of the bill, the same issues are at play."\par \par \uc2 Like Arizona, the Utah, Georgia and Alabama laws grants broader powers to police than the federal government permits. Simply detaining a suspected \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who has not committed a major crime -- which could happen in all of the states -- is going beyond a state's authorized authority.\par \par \uc2 "The core immigration power is control of the border," said Raquel Aldana, a law professor at University of the Pacific in California. "They control it by deciding who can come in, who can't come in and who has to leave. There is not much of an argument a state can make against that power."\par \par \uc2 But the sponsors of the laws in Georgia and Utah disagree.\par \par \uc2 Georgia state Rep. Matt Ramsey, R-Peachtree City, said Arizona ran afoul of the Constitution because they made illegal immigration a state crime, as well. That would mean the state could imprison an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  even if the federal government told them to release the person.\par \par \uc2 "We didn't create any offense based strictly on immigration status," Ramsey said. "We're truly about identifying individuals in the country illegally. What happens after that is up to the federal government."\par \par \uc2 Despite the temporary restraining order issued against Utah's law, Ramsey said the second-generation enforcement laws will eventually pass legal muster.\par \par \uc2 That same confidence is expressed by Utah supporters. The sponsor of House Bill 497, Rep. Stephen Sandstrom, R-Orem, said he spent months publicly discussing the proposal -- which initially was identical to Arizona's law -- and thoroughly reviewed the Arizona court ruling before passing the bill in early March.\par \par \uc2 "We were doing the due diligence to make sure it's constitutional," Sandstrom said.\par \par \uc2 Just as Arizona's court fight helped shape laws passed this year, future legislation may very well use Utah or Georgia's problems for guidance, said University of Utah law professor Wayne McCormack. But without federal approval, states will likely continue to run afoul of the Constitution.\par \par \uc2 "The question is whether the federal government will allow the states to have a role," McCormack said. "That's going to be the biggest issue for the courts."\par \par \uc2 ------------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writers Kate Brumback in Atlanta and Phillip Rawls in Montgomery, Ala., contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 Josh Loftin can be reached at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://twitter.com/joshloftin"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://twitter.com/joshloftin}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110513e75d001el\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc87}{\*\bkmkend toc87}\b \uc2 AP Essay: Man of Steel, Man of Tomorrow _ man without a country?\b0\par\par\uc2 By TED ANTHONY   \par \uc2 AP National Writer\par \uc2 1,381 \uc2 words\par \uc2 12 May 2011\par 11:16\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2011.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 NEW YORK (AP) - There is a scene in the 2006 movie "Superman Returns" that captures the fabled Man of Steel in an extraordinary moment. Floating high above the Earth, gazing down upon America, he listens with his super-hearing for cries of help as a cacophony of people, in all the world's languages, live their lives.\par \par \uc2 The message is clear: Kal-El of Krypton -- strange visitor from another world and, let's face it, America's ultimate \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  -- is a citizen and protector of the entire planet Earth, not merely the 50 United States.\par \par \uc2 For 73 years, Superman walked, leaped and flew through the skies as a presumed American, his red, yellow and blue a stand-in for the red, white and blue of the nation he adopted as a boy when his spacecraft crash-landed smack in the middle of a Kansas farmer's field.\par \par \uc2 Until now. In the latest issue of Action Comics, 900 issues after he first appeared in 1938, Superman stood on the grounds of Camp David on a foggy afternoon and told the president's national security adviser that he planned to renounce his U.S. citizenship. Seems Washington didn't much like Superman showing up at a peaceful protest in Tehran, Iran. Also seems Superman didn't much like Washington calling him out on it.\par \par \uc2 "I've been thinking too small. I realize that now," the Man of Steel says in the story by David S. Goyer. "I'm tired of having my actions construed as instruments of U.S. policy. `Truth, justice and the American way' -- it's not enough anymore."\par \par \uc2 Backlash came quickly, if predictably. Republican politician Mike Huckabee called it "disturbing," Bill O'Reilly weighed in, and already there is talk that the brief story was just a one-off -- or even that it never really "happened" in the larger continuity of the Superman saga. In the world of comics writing, such things are easily solved.\par \par \uc2 However it turns out, though, a point long implied has been made explicit: Whether in fact or perception, the character of Superman has been loosely cast for generations as an instrument of American policy, spreading democracy's ideals around the planet even as he becomes more of a global citizen with each passing decade.\par \par \uc2 From the earliest comics by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, Superman was positioned as a defender of America. By the time Max and Dave Fleischer made the first cartoons about the character in the early 1940s, it was more explicit: He battled caricatured "Japoteurs" and was clearly on the side of the Allies during World War II.\par \par \uc2 "American soldiers cheering me, when all civilized people in the world are cheering them," Superman says in "America's Secret Weapon," a comic from 1943. "It's the grandest tribute I've ever had."\par \par \uc2 As the years passed, the quest for "truth and justice" became, for the 1940s radio serial and the 1950s TV series "The Adventures of Superman," a battle for "truth, justice and the American way" -- an unsurprising turn of phrase for a TV show that debuted two months before the dawn of Eisenhower-era America.\par \par \uc2 By the 1960s, Superman was visiting JFK in the White House and trusting the president with his secret identity (though the planned story was shelved for months after Kennedy was assassinated), while also stopping by the United Nations. In the Christopher Reeve movies of the 1970s and 1980s, too, the Man of Tomorrow seems clearly on the side of the American government most of the time. And after 9/11, Superman made an appearance, albeit a very nonpartisan one, in a compilation of comics about the 2001 terrorist attacks.\par \par \uc2 Nowhere is the tension between Superman's outsiderness and Americanness more evident than in the decade-long TV series "Smallville," which wraps up Friday with a two-hour series finale that is expected to put its version of the hero, played by Tom Welling, in cape and tights for the first time.\par \par \uc2 With the luxury of 10 years to play with, "Smallville" reframed Clark Kent's coming of age in Smallville, Kan., as an angsty, conspiracy-ridden epic full of beautiful young American faces -- "The X-Files" meets "Dawson's Creek," in a way, though it escaped that box years ago.\par \par \uc2 In recent years Smallville's producers have teased out the theme of an outsider who arrived in America the day a meteor shower rained down upon the heartland. Young Clark Kent -- called "The Blur" in his mysterious pre-Superman displays of heroics -- is pursued relentlessly by shady agents of the American military-industrial complex.\par \par \uc2 In secret installations dappled with light and checkered with shadows, these covert operatives plot the undoing of Clark and his hero friends. They consider The Blur a dangerous interloper with a hidden agenda who may not have the country's best interests at heart. We, the viewers, know better.\par \par \uc2 When you look at the history of American superhero comics, you realize that the most memorable good guys have one thing in common: Like Clark Kent, they're outsiders, whether by birth, choice or accident. That gives them the narrative tension of a built-in internal struggle.\par \par \uc2 Batman was pushed to a darker side by the murder of his parents. Spider-Man, the Hulk, the Fantastic Four: All were turned into freaks by experiments gone awry. Even Captain America is a scientific guinea pig of the military and the government, albeit voluntarily; he is the only one of his kind, with nobody to truly understand his supersoldier existence.\par \par \uc2 Then there's Superman, who stands alone. His planet is in fragments, his people dead except for the odd superpowered straggler who turns up now and then. He has grown up in an archetypal American childhood -- a farm outside a small Midwestern town -- but is, despite everything about him, an impostor. He is very much American, and he is very much alien -- not unlike the waves of immigrants, legal and otherwise, who have spent the last two centuries coming here to make, or remake, their lives against a blank canvas.\par \par \uc2 But does that Americanness, that happenstance of arrival and upbringing, truly matter so much? Is it a truly integral part of the Man of Steel, inseparable from his flying and super-breath and X-ray vision?\par \par \uc2 Eight years ago, a DC Comics story line called "Red Son" speculated what might have happened if that spaceship from Krypton had landed on a collective farm in Ukraine instead of in Kansas. That Superman, the comic postulated, "fights a never-ending battle for Stalin, socialism and the international expansion of the Warsaw Pact."\par \par \uc2 And yet despite the change of venue, despite the politics in which that Superman came of age, in the end he does the right thing for the world, American or not.\par \par \uc2 Kansas farm boy though he may be, Clark Kent is always an outsider in every incarnation of the character. He is struggling to assimilate in a society whose identity is built upon both accepting immigrants and being suspicious of them. As "Smallville" winds to a close Friday, you get the distinct sense that as American as he feels, Tom Welling's Clark Kent is -- like many of Superman's previous incarnations in recent years -- just as concerned about the larger family of man.\par \par \uc2 Which brings us back to Action Comics No. 900 and the Superman who, in that one short story buried deep in the book, balks at being pushed around by the White House. It's easy to wonder: Would this Superman have helped the Navy SEALs who raided Osama bin Laden's compound in Pakistan earlier this month?

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) - A bill requiring officers in South Carolina to check the legal status of someone they suspect is in the country illegally advanced Thursday over arguments that it would encourage racial profiling and invite criminals to prey on people too afraid to contact authorities.\par \par \uc2 A House Judiciary panel voted 3-2 to advance the bill to the full committee.\par \par \uc2 The subcommittee also added penalties of up to $50,000 for businesses that are repeatedly caught not checking their new hires' status or knowingly hiring illegal immigrants, and then refuse to comply with a temporary shut-down order. The director of the state's labor agency requested the changes to strengthen the state's 2008 anti-illegal immigration law, which began applying to all businesses last year.\par \par \uc2 "It gives me the ability to actually do something to them," director Catherine Templeton said.\par \par \uc2 With just three weeks left in the legislative session, House Republicans are on a tight schedule to get the bill into law this year. As the meeting began, House Judiciary Chairman Jim Harrison asked supporters to limit their testimony so the panel could get to a vote, the outcome of which was already known. The full committee will take up the bill Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 The measure requires that the status check follow a traffic stop or arrest for something else. Unlike a law passed in Arizona last year, South Carolina's proposal would not hold someone based on suspicion. The bill says the officer must call Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and if there's no response, process the suspect normally.\par \par \uc2 It also creates a new police unit to enforce the state's immigration laws.\par \par \uc2 Linda Rouvet of Charleston testified that her only son was killed by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  in a June 2008 hit-and-run. Another woman from North Charleston testified that an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  tried to rape her in April 2010, and could get out on parole as early as this summer. She was incensed that he was allowed to plea to a lower charge and be labeled as non-violent.\par \par \uc2 "We already have criminals," said Roan Garcia-Quintana, who heads an organization called Americans Have Had Enough. "We don't need to import them."\par \par \uc2 Amanda Elias Vargas, a citizen, countered that suggesting all illegal immigrants are violent criminals is akin to blaming all South Carolinians for Susan Smith killing her two boys in 1994.\par \par \uc2 "These kinds of conclusions are illogical," she said.\par \par \uc2 Victims' advocates said they fear the law will make immigrants too scared to report crimes against themselves or others, or to serve as a witness.\par \par \uc2 Rep. James Smith, D-Columbia, called it the "rapist, wife-beater protection act" that will criminalize people who aren't criminals. Supporters of the bill want to stop people from crossing the border into the U.S., and that's not something South Carolina can do, he said.\par \par \uc2 "It's open season on undocumented immigrants," he said.\par \par \uc2 But Sheri Irwin of Charleston argued that's a good reason to pass the bill, so immigrants don't come here illegally.\par \par \uc2 "I'm tired of these excuses," she said. "It's about the sovereignty of our country."\par \par \uc2 Supporters point out the bill specifically bars racial profiling, but opponents say that's a joke.\par \par \uc2 Gregory Torrales, a Columbia insurance agent, said police cars recently surrounded his vehicle outside a Greenwood restaurant and demanded to see his identification.\par \par \uc2 "I had never been that humiliated in my life," said the native of Puerto Rico. "Once the officer recognized I was an American citizen, he apologized profusely. But those are the situations this bill creates."\par \par \uc2 Columbia restaurant owner Michelle Wang said she felt compelled to speak because she feels the state she loves is rejecting the American ideals of justice and freedom. She said she came to the United States from China as a student in 1989, and the law reminds her of restrictions in her native country.\par \par \uc2 "I wake up every day with such a strong gratitude. ... This country has a promise to everybody," said Wang, founder of the Miyo's restaurants. Checking IDs, she added, "is not a civil society."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110512e75c001c1\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PAWTUCKET, R.I. (AP) - A former head of the Rhode Island State Police announced his bid Thursday to run for the congressional seat held by freshman Democratic Rep. David Cicilline, pledging to focus on promoting job growth and fighting waste and corruption in Washington if elected.\par \par \uc2 Brendan Doherty, who will run as a Republican in 2012, says his career in public service with the state police led him to declare his candidacy.\par \par \uc2 Doherty was state police superintendent from 2007 until this spring, when he retired. He previously spent 24 years on the force.\par \par \uc2 In Washington, Doherty said, he would hope to promote job growth in the private sector.\par \par \uc2 "The solution to our economic recovery is jobs -- not jobs that the government gives you, but jobs created by companies," he told a crowd of about 200 people gathered for his announcement in a Pawtucket packaging plant.\par \par \uc2 He also said he hopes to lead the fight against wasteful spending and unethical practices. He would determine his focus after getting oriented to Congress, he said.\par \par \uc2 In addition, Doherty told The Associated Press in an interview after his speech Thursday, he would be interested in serving on the House Appropriations Committee or the House Homeland Security Committee.\par \par \uc2 Former state Rep. John Loughlin, a Republican, lost to Cicilline in November. Loughlin has said it would be premature to say officially that he will run again in the heavily Democratic 1st Congressional District. But, he noted, he's taking the steps needed to run against Cicilline again, which could pave the way for a contested Republican primary.\par \par \uc2 Ed Pacheco, the chairman of Rhode Island's Democratic Party, said such a primary would work in Democrats' favor.\par \par \uc2 "It looks like the Republicans are going to have a primary, and while they're pandering to voters, the congressman will be in Washington doing what he was elected to do," Pacheco said.\par \par \uc2 Asked about Doherty's candidacy, Cicilline told the AP it's too early to focus on a re-election bid.\par \par \uc2 "The election we just had was about five months ago," he said. "There will be lots of opportunities next year to campaign, but right now my priority is focusing on what I got sent to Congress to do."\par \par \uc2 After his work with the state police, Doherty is perhaps best known for his support of local law enforcement paying greater attention to illegal immigration. He supported a controversial 2008 executive order -- issued by former Gov. Don Carcieri, a Republican -- cracking down on illegal immigration. Current Gov. Lincoln Chafee, an independent, rescinded that order in January.\par \par \uc2 Doherty did not focus on immigration during his speech Thursday. But a list of the issues he plans to focus on describes U.S. immigration policy as "broken and misguided" and says the lack of consistent enforcement of immigration laws has sent "mixed messages to the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  community."\par \par \uc2 The former state police head announced his resignation from that position shortly after he criticized sharply an attempt by Providence officials to opt out of "Secure Communities," a federal program that requires communities to run criminal suspects' fingerprints through an immigration database. His criticism prompted a rebuke from Chafee.\par \par \uc2 ----\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writer David Klepper contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110512e75c000rv\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

COOPER   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 840 \uc2 words\par \uc2 11 May 2011\par 22:29\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2011.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SALEM, Ore. (AP) - Passionate citizens told Oregon lawmakers Wednesday that giving some illegal immigrants subsidized university tuition would be rewarding lawbreakers and harming a cash-strapped state. Others told their elected officials that they have an opportunity to take a stand on a basic issue of fairness.\par \par \uc2 Lawmakers on the House Rules Committee heard more than two hours of public testimony Wednesday on one of the most emotion-packed issues facing legislators this year: A proposal to allow illegal immigrants who attended high school in Oregon to pay in-state tuition at public universities.\par \par \uc2 "What the bill would allow is contrary to what our country stands for," said Don Nash of Lake Oswego.\par \par \uc2 The committee has not scheduled a vote on SB 742, which passed the Senate in March with support from all 15 Democrats who were present and three Republicans.\par \par \uc2 "It's not my fault my parents brought me here," said 14-year-old Alicio Reyes, who was brought to the U.S. from Mexico when he was 3. "I'm just a kid whose smart enough to know I want to go to college someday."\par \par \uc2 At least one member of each political party must sign on to advance the bill out of the House committee, which is evenly divided between Republicans and Democrats. Its prospects in the committee are uncertain, but proponents could call for a vote of the full House if they can show they have enough support to pass it.\par \par \uc2 The measure would require universities to charge in-state tuition to illegal immigrants who attended at least five years of school in the United States, at least three of them in Oregon. They must be dependent on another adult for support and apply to college within three years of receiving a high school or GED diploma.\par \par \uc2 The hearing comes a day after President Barack Obama called on Congress to overhaul the immigration system.\par \par \uc2 The in-state tuition would be good for up to five years at one of seven universities governed by the State Board of Higher Education. Students would be required to attest that they have applied for legal residency -- a provision aimed at ensuring they're eligible to work in the U.S. after they receive a degree.\par \par \uc2 Still, opponents of the measure question whether many illegal immigrants would ever complete the long, expensive immigration process to become eligible to work in the United States. Illegal activity should never be excused, opponents say, and the state should not give illegal immigrants a benefit that isn't available to U.S. citizens who live in other states.\par \par \uc2 "The word illegal already indicates a breaking of laws," said Cliff Girod of Salem. "To allow anyone here illegally to take advantage of subsidized tuition is grossly unfair to our legal citizens."\par \par \uc2 Proponents of the legislation say undocumented minors who graduate from Oregon high schools are brought into the country by their parents, and some are brought as toddlers and have few ties to their home country. Those students shouldn't be punished for their parents' crimes, they argue.\par \par \uc2 And, proponents say, the state should help students be productive residents after investing in years of public education.\par \par \uc2 Paz Ramos, principal of Alder Elementary School in Portland, said his school promotes college to students beginning in kindergarten.\par \par \uc2 "We have set high expectations for all of our students: You are going to college no matter what," Thomas said. "That dream can be a reality for more students if this bill is passed."\par \par \uc2 Illegal immigrants are not prohibited from attending private universities but they must pay out-of-state tuition, which is often prohibitively expensive.\par \par \uc2 The difference between resident and nonresident tuition is different at every school but can be significant. At the University of Oregon, in-state tuition this year is $8,190, compared with $25,830 for an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , out-of-state student or international student.\par \par \uc2 Opponents of the bill argued it would force the universities to give up thousands in lost revenue from students who otherwise would pay nonresident tuition. An analysis by the Oregon University System projected the schools would make money from the arrangement because more students would be able to afford to attend. University analysts projected that no single school would take in enough new students to need to hire more faculty and increase costs.\par \par \uc2 The measure would take effect beginning in the 2012-13 school year. University officials project they'd take on three additional students in the first year and 33 additional students the following year.\par \par \uc2 Illegal immigrants would continue to be prohibited from receiving state or federal scholarships.\par \par \uc2 The bill has picked up support from the Board of Higher Education as well as the Association of Oregon Industries, which lobbies on behalf of business interests.\par \par \uc2 "This bill is about fairness," said Rep. Bob Jenson, R-Pendleton, one of two Republicans who have signed on to the bill. The other is Rep. Mark Johnson of Hood River.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110512e75c000a5\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

But the push against illegal immigrants has run headlong into another Republican priority -- creating a pro-business environment -- and business and industry leaders have quietly resisted attempts to add more restrictions on the hiring of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  workers.\par \par \uc2 Faught said he personally wasn't pressured by business and industry leaders to remove language targeting employers.\par \par \uc2 "Did they apply pressure to leadership? You could make the case that there wasn't the political will to go in that direction," Faught said.\par \par \uc2 Other provisions of the bill allow the seizure of vehicles used to smuggle humans and direct the Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics to be the primary investigative agency for human trafficking or human smuggling. It also authorizes the Council on Law Enforcement Education and Training to develop an illegal immigration curriculum for local law enforcement officers.\par \par \uc2 But some of the Legislature's harshest critics of illegal immigration immediately derided the proposal as a "watered down" measure with no substance.\par \par \uc2 Freshman state Sen. Ralph Shortey, who introduced several immigration bills this year that were not heard in the House, said a joint House and Senate committee created to study illegal immigration was designed by House leaders "to put this issue on the backburner."\par \par \uc2 Shortey said that after reviewing Faught's bill, he requested that his name be removed as a co-author.\par \par \uc2 "I don't want to be tied to this bill in any way," said Shortey, R-Oklahoma City. "Even the most ignorant people in the state will look at this thing and say it's a pseudo-amnesty bill. This is not an illegal immigration bill. This is a 'we want to help you be more comfortable in our state' bill."\par \par \uc2 The bill is expected to be unveiled later this week in a conference committee before it's voted upon in the House and Senate.\par \par \uc2 Republican Gov. Mary Fallin said Wednesday she has not seen the latest version of the bill, but that she hopes the measure "will focus on public safety."\par \par \uc2 Patricia Fennell, the executive director of the Latino Community Development Agency, said Republican lawmakers are trying to appeal to the business community and hard-line conservatives who want to punish illegal aliens without alienating a rapidly growing Hispanic community in Oklahoma.\par \par \uc2 "They're trying to appease the Tea Party types while at the same time trying not to antagonize the Latino vote," Fennell said. "The Latino vote is gaining significance every year ... and immigration has become the ping pong ball in the political game."\par \par \uc2 More than 17 percent of the 580,000 residents of Oklahoma City, the state's largest city, now identify themselves as being of Hispanic descent. In Tulsa, the state's second-largest city, 14 percent of its 392,000 residents say they are Hispanic, according to the latest data from the U.S. Census Bureau. Lawton and Enid also recorded significant concentrations of Hispanic residents.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110511e75b002qm\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - San Francisco's mayor said Tuesday that the city will no longer automatically report \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  youths to federal authorities when they are arrested on felony charges -- a shift he said stays true to the city's longstanding sanctuary city policy.\par \par \uc2 Mayor Edwin Lee told the Board of Supervisors at its weekly meeting that juveniles who are first-time offenders, enrolled in school and can show family ties to the San Francisco Bay area would not be reported to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the San Francisco Chronicle reports.\par \par \uc2 Lee said his directive follows the intent of San Francisco's 22-year-old Sanctuary City ordinance, which requires local officials not to hand immigrants to federal authorities unless they're charged with serious crimes.\par \par \uc2 Lee's position falls in the middle ground between his predecessor Gavin Newsom's hard-line policy toward arrested juveniles and the more liberal stance adopted by the Board of Supervisors.\par \par \uc2 Supervisors passed a law in 2009 that would have required the city to report only juveniles who have been convicted of felonies -- not just arrested. Newsom refused to enforce it.\par \par \uc2 The new policy will be carried out by the San Francisco Juvenile Probation Department and was crafted after discussions with civil rights attorneys and top law enforcement officials, Lee said.\par \par \uc2 "I've had to take care in balancing the issue of public safety and also due process," Lee told the supervisors.\par \par \uc2 Since 2008, the probation department has reported all 159 minors arrested on felony charges to ICE, including 110 with felony convictions, said William Sifferman, the chief juvenile probation officer.\par \par \uc2 "I don't think public safety will be imperiled," Sifferman told the Chronicle when asked about the policy shift.\par \par \uc2 Lee said he hopes the policy will withstand federal scrutiny.\par \par \uc2 Virginia Kice, a spokeswoman for ICE, declined to comment on the mayor's edict. She told the Chronicle the agency's enforcement priorities would continue to "focus on the identification and removal of foreign nationals who pose a public safety threat."\par \par \uc2 San Francisco Sheriff Michael Hennessey recently announced that the county jail soon will begin releasing illegal immigrants being held for low-level offenses, even if ICE officials request that they remain in custody. Hennessey said he is simply trying to obey the Sanctuary City ordinance.\par \par \uc2 The ordinance came under heavy criticism in 2008 after the fatal shooting of city resident Tony Bologna and his sons, Michael and Matthew. The suspect, Edwin Ramos, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from El Salvador, had been protected by the sanctuary city policy during earlier arrests when he was a juvenile.\par \par \uc2 The victims' relatives later filed a lawsuit against the city claiming the policy contributed to the murders by shielding Ramos from immigration authorities. In February, a state appeals court rejected that claim.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Information from: San Francisco Chronicle, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.sfgate.com/chronicle"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.sfgate.com/chronicle}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110511e75b0022s\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

COOPER   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 598 \uc2 words\par \uc2 11 May 2011\par 12:32\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2011.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SALEM, Ore. (AP) - A state House committee will hear from the public Wednesday about a bill that would allow some illegal immigrants to pay in-state tuition at public universities in Oregon.\par \par \uc2 The issue has sparked emotional argument from proponents who say young illegal immigrants shouldn't be punished for their parents' actions, and from opponents who say it would encourage people to sneak into the country.\par \par \uc2 The Senate approved the bill in March with support from all 15 Democrats who were present and three Republicans. The House Rules Committee has scheduled a public hearing on SB 742 for Wednesday afternoon, but the committee will not vote on the measure.\par \par \uc2 The bill needs the support of at least one member of each party in the Rules Committee, which is evenly divided with four Republicans and four Democrats. Two House Republicans co-sponsored the bill but neither is on the committee, so its prospects of picking up GOP support there are uncertain.\par \par \uc2 The measure would require universities to charge in-state tuition to illegal immigrants who attended at least five years of school in the United States, at least three of them in Oregon. They must be dependent on another adult for support and apply to college within three years of receiving a high school or GED diploma.\par \par \uc2 The in-state tuition would be good for up to five years at one of seven universities governed by the State Board of Higher Education. Students would be required to attest that they have applied for legal residency -- a provision aimed at ensuring they're eligible to work in the U.S. after they receive a degree. Still, opponents of the measure question whether many illegal immigrants would ever complete the long, expensive immigration process to become eligible to work in the United States.\par \par \uc2 Proponents of the legislation say undocumented minors who graduate from Oregon high schools are brought into the country by their parents, and some are brought as toddlers and have few ties to their home country. Those students shouldn't be punished for their parents' crimes, they argue.\par \par \uc2 And, proponents say, the state should help students be productive residents after investing in years of public education.\par \par \uc2 But opponents say illegal activity should never be excused, and the state should not give illegal immigrants a benefit that isn't available to U.S. citizens who live in other states.\par \par \uc2 Illegal immigrants are not prohibited from attending private universities but they must pay out-of-state tuition, which is often prohibitively expensive.\par \par \uc2 The difference between resident and nonresident tuition is different at every school but can be significant. At the University of Oregon, in-state tuition this year is $8,190, compared with $25,830 for an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , out-of-state student or international student.\par \par \uc2 Opponents of the bill argued it would force the universities to give up thousands in lost revenue from students who otherwise would pay nonresident tuition. An analysis by the Oregon University System projected the schools would make money from the arrangement because more students would be able to afford to attend. University analysts projected that no single school would take in enough new students to need to hire more faculty and increase costs.\par \par \uc2 The measure would take effect beginning in the 2012-13 school year. University officials project they'd take on three additional students in the first year and 33 additional students the following year.\par \par \uc2 Illegal immigrants would continue to be prohibited from receiving state or federal scholarships.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110511e75b0017i\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 DETROIT (AP) - An eight-year prison sentence for an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  has been overturned again after a federal judge in Michigan, partly concerned about cost, did not allow the man to appear in court and speak.\par \par \uc2 It is the second time that U.S. District Judge Lawrence Zatkoff in Port Huron has been reversed in the case of Julio Garcia-Robles, a convicted felon who has repeatedly entered the U.S. illegally. And it's the second time in less than a week that a Zatkoff sentence has been thrown out on similar grounds.\par \par \uc2 Federal prosecutors had recommended about three years in prison for Garcia-Robles, the top penalty according to the guidelines, but the judge chose a tougher punishment, ordering eight years in a 12-page opinion in 2009.\par \par \uc2 At the time, Garcia-Robles already was in federal prison based on Zatkoff's earlier identical sentence in 2007.\par \par \uc2 "Bringing defendant back to this court from Beaumont, Texas, would necessitate an extraordinary amount of government time and expense, as well as create security risks and the need for additional security measures, all relevant concerns in the absence of the right of defendant to be present," the judge said.\par \par \uc2 But the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Tuesday said Zatkoff was wrong. A three-judge panel said the right to speak is "essential."\par \par \uc2 "The notion that the sentencing court must 'eyeball' the defendant at the instant it exercises its most important judicial responsibility ... is far from a formality. Indeed, this requirement 'is a fundamental procedural guarantee that places the defendant before the judge at a culminating moment of the criminal judicial process,'" the court said, quoting a decision from another appeals court.\par \par \uc2 Garcia-Robles wants a different judge to handle his sentence a third time, but the case will remain with Zatkoff, who has been on the federal bench for about 25 years. The appeals court believes he will "re-visit the matter with a completely open mind."\par \par \uc2 Last week, another three-judge panel at the appeals court overturned a 12 1/2-year sentence in a different case handled by Zatkoff.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ATLANTA (AP) - Jessica Colotl has always tried to keep a low profile -- obeying the speed limit, making sure her car's lights work properly -- knowing that a brush with law enforcement could lead to her deportation and cost her a college diploma.\par \par \uc2 After a few close calls, her fears were realized last spring, when she was stopped for a minor traffic violation, charged with driving without a license and turned over to immigration authorities. She spent 37 days in a detention center in Alabama before authorities let her out and said they would give her a year to finish her studies at Kennesaw State University.\par \par \uc2 Before her arrest, Colotl had revealed her immigration status only to her closest friends. In the five weeks she was held last spring, her sorority sisters marched to have her freed, her case went viral and she was thrust into the national spotlight.\par \par \uc2 She emerged a reluctant symbol, seized upon by both sides of the debate over illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 "It was a very beautiful and scary case at the same time," said Georgina Perez, who was brought to the U.S. illegally as a young child, as was Colotl. "When they let her go, we were all so happy. But then when I saw how the anti-immigrant people went after her, I became scared."\par \par \uc2 Advocates for tighter restrictions on illegal immigrants argued in letters to the editor and complaints to the Georgia university system that illegal immigrants like Colotl shouldn't be allowed to attend state schools and should be deported.\par \par \uc2 "I think it's grossly unfair to the real immigrants who have followed the rules to come here legally," said D.A. King, founder of the Dustin Inman Society, which advocates stricter enforcement of immigration laws.\par \par \uc2 Through it all, the soft-spoken Colotl has been left wondering, "Why me?"\par \par \uc2 "I don't like it at all," she said of the intense scrutiny she's endured. "I've never liked to be the center of attention, especially for a controversial issue."\par \par \uc2 Colotl, 22, is among hundreds of thousands of young people who have been brought into the U.S. illegally by their parents. Many hold out hope that Congress will eventually provide a path to legalization for certain illegal immigrants brought here as children. A group of U.S. senators on Wednesday reintroduced the DREAM Act, which would do just that. Similar legislation has failed in Congress several times before, most recently in December.\par \par \uc2 Groups of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students around the country have staged high-profile actions over the past year to draw attention to their plight and urge lawmakers to act. Last month, Perez was one of seven \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  youths who demanded greater access to higher education by sitting down in an Atlanta street blocking traffic until police arrested them.\par \par \uc2 Unlike the students who have revealed their illegal status voluntarily, Colotl didn't choose to go public. She supports their actions, she said, but has been too busy with school and her sorority to participate.\par \par \uc2 "I know a lot of people in the community sometimes wish she would come out more, but it's completely understandable with everything she's been through that she doesn't want to," Perez said.\par \par \uc2 Colotl's case sparked public concerns that Georgia state colleges and universities were being overrun by illegal immigrants, that taxpayers were subsidizing their education and legal residents were being displaced. Yet a study conducted by the university system's Board of Regents found that less than 1 percent of the state's public college students were illegal immigrants, and that students who pay out-of-state tuition -- which illegal immigrants are required to do -- more than pay for their education.\par \par \uc2 The board implemented a new policy in October barring any school that has rejected academically qualified applicants in the previous two years from accepting illegal immigrants. State lawmakers tried to go a step farther, introducing an ultimately unsuccessful bill that would have prohibited all of Georgia's state colleges and universities from admitting illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 King, an ardent supporter of that bill, said he used Colotl's case last year to file a complaint against the Board of Regents. Young people like Colotl who were brought here by their parents present a sympathetic case, he said, but he blames their parents for their situation.\par \par \uc2 "I think Jessica Colotl should have been deported last year as an example to the parents who are shamelessly bringing their children into this country," he said.\par \par \uc2 Colotl's parents brought her from Puebla, Mexico, to the U.S. when she was 11. She completed high school in Georgia and went on to Kennesaw State, from which she graduated Wednesday with a major in political science with a legal studies concentration and minor in French.\par \par \uc2 She very nearly missed out on walking in cap and gown -- her one-year reprieve was extended for another year last week, days before it was to expire. Now she hopes to become an immigration lawyer.\par \par \uc2 Although she didn't invite the spotlight, Colotl still feels it's had a positive effect.\par \par \uc2 "I have a few friends who were completely against immigration of any kind, and when they read about my story, they changed their minds and a lot of them told me, 'We were not right in our opinions, and I appreciate you for educating me on this subject,'" she said.\par \par \uc2 She's also been contacted by some \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  high school students who are inspired by her case.\par \par \uc2 "That has been the most rewarding part of everything, that other students see this struggle as motivation to keep fighting and to get a higher education," she said.\par \par \uc2 Despite all her troubles over the past year, Colotl doesn't regret her parents' decision to bring her here.\par \par \uc2 "I would never dare to blame them for trying to give me a better life," she said.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110511e75b000t4\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) - Illegal immigrants who meet certain conditions will be able to pay in-state college tuition in Maryland under a bill signed Tuesday by Gov. Martin O'Malley at a time when many other states are taking a harder stance against illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 The Democratic governor posed for five sets of photographs during a ceremony to accommodate the large number of supporters in attendance to see one of the high-profile bill signed.\par \par \uc2 "This will allow us to have a more highly educated workforce in our state," O'Malley said, during a bill-signing ceremony where he signed scores of other measures.\par \par \uc2 Supporters cheered the occasion outside the Maryland State House, chanting: "Yes, we can," and "U-S-A!"\par \par \uc2 Jerry Torres, a 19-year-old who has been following the legislation this year as a member of an immigrant service group in the Washington suburbs called CASA de Maryland, praised the law.\par \par \uc2 "I'm a legal resident, but I'm doing it for other people, like my friends and some people in my family," Torres, of Silver Spring, said.\par \par \uc2 The measure allows illegal immigrants to pay in-state tuition rates at public colleges if they complete two years at a community college. Students also will have to show that their parents paid state income taxes. Male students also will be required to sign up for Selective Service to be eligible for the draft.\par \par \uc2 Republican opponents are leading a petition drive in hopes of overturning the legislation in a 2012 referendum. Opponents have until May 31 to submit one-third of the 55,700 signatures needed to put the measure on next year's ballot. The rest are due June 30. The bill is set to take effect June 30.\par \par \uc2 Republican Delegate Patrick McDonough, one of the Maryland General Assembly's leading critics of illegal immigration, said taxpayers are wasting millions education people who cannot legally be hired in the state. McDonough, who represents parts of Baltimore and Harford counties, said Maryland is being turned into a "sanctuary state" for illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 "This law will only make things worse," McDonough said.\par \par \uc2 Gustavo Torres, executive director of Casa de Maryland, said that even if opponents succeed in the difficult task of collecting enough signatures for the referendum, he is confident Maryland voters would not overturn the legislation.\par \par \uc2 "This is about education," Torres said. "Our people know exactly how education is so important for the families, not only for some families but for everybody."\par \par \uc2 The legislation was one of the most high-profile bills in Maryland's legislative session, which ended in April. Debate in the House of Delegates became so heated at times that House Speaker Michael Busch paused to ask everyone to "take a deep breath" during debate.\par \par \uc2 Since 2001, 10 states have enacted laws to allow illegal immigrants to pay in-state tuition rates at public universities. They are California, Illinois, Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah and Washington. However, many states are now cracking down on illegal immigration following Republican gains in November.\par \par \uc2 The Maryland bill includes a provision that requires illegal immigrants receiving the reduced tuition rate to count as a part of the school's out-of-state student pool, so in-state student slots for Maryland residents won't be affected.\par \par \uc2 Sen. Victor Ramirez, a Prince George's County Democrat and bill sponsor who immigrated legally as a child from El Salvador, said the bill will help people who came to the United States as young people, whose parents have been contributing members of the state for years.\par \par \uc2 "There's not a free ride," said Sen. Victor Ramirez, a Prince George's County Democrat and bill sponsor who immigrated legally as a child from El Salvador. "It's not displacing anybody. "It's about education. It's not about immigration."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110510e75a001mz\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) - A proposal to require contractors doing business with state government to verify that their employees are U.S. citizens cleared the House transportation committee on Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 Under the measure, contractors who fail to verify the status would face the possibility of losing their current state contract, lose eligibility for future deals for up to three years and pay any costs caused by the contract cancellation.\par \par \uc2 Catholic Church representatives testified against the bill, arguing it would damage the state economy in a purely symbolic effort against illegal immigration. The bill takes one of the most targeted approaches of all the immigration bills facing lawmakers this year.\par \par \uc2 It is supported by both the conservative Louisiana Family Forum and major unions, but opposed by builders and business associations across the state.\par \par \uc2 Lawmakers amended the bill Tuesday to remove any civil or criminal penalty a contractor might face for refusing to hire an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Bill author Rep. John Bel Edwards, D-Amite, said the amendment resolves concerns that employers would be punished for lacking the expertise to sniff out fraud.\par \par \uc2 "If they in good faith reasonably rely on the documentation provided by that employee and run that information through the database, and it comes back that that person's eligible for hire, there will be no penalties associated," said Edwards.\par \par \uc2 He said the accuracy of the federal E-Verify system, required by the bill, has improved significantly over the years. The database is free and provides instantaneous results that are accurate over 97 percent of the time, Edwards told the committee.\par \par \uc2 But Sue Weishar of the Jesuit Social Research Institute said the system is unable to detect identity theft and would instead encourage such fraud. Weishar said the E-Verify mandate would also push illegal immigrants into unregulated economic sectors, resulting in declining tax revenue.\par \par \uc2 "It'll prove costly to employers, workers and taxpayers," she said.\par \par \uc2 Weishar cited a Department of Homeland Security Study finding that 44 percent of employers didn't notify workers of a problem with E-Verify search, meaning that valid workers are turned down for employment without an opportunity to appeal.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Online:\par \par \uc2 House Bill 342 can be found at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK
