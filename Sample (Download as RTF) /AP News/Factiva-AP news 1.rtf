\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc2}{\*\bkmkend toc2}\b \uc2 GOP upstart Cain targeted in GOP debate; tax plan derided by fellow presidential contenders\b0\par\par\uc2 By KASIE HUNT   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 1,096 \uc2 words\par \uc2 19 October 2011\par 02:32\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2011.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 LAS VEGAS (AP) - Republican presidential contenders attacked upstart Herman Cain's economic plan as a tax increase waiting to happen Tuesday night, moving swiftly in a fiery campaign debate to blunt the former businessman's unlikely rise in the race for the party's nomination.\par \par \uc2 Old animosities flared, too, as former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and Texas Gov. Rick Perry swapped criticism in unusually personal terms. "You have a problem with allowing someone to finish speaking," Romney declared as the two men interrupted one another repeatedly in a disagreement over immigration, one of several vigorous clashes they had.\par \par \uc2 In a bow to Nevada voters, who will be among the first to choose among the candidates early next year, no one said he wanted to open a proposed nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain in a remote part of the state.\par \par \uc2 The fifth debate in six weeks ranged over familiar and contentious territory -- from immigration and health care to the economy and energy, often in antagonistic terms. The candidates engaged each other more directly and sometimes more heatedly than in previous debates.\par \par \uc2 Romney's Mormon faith also came up, and Perry said he disagreed with a pastor and political supporter who described the religion as a cult. "I can't apologize any more than that," the Texan said.\par \par \uc2 "That's fine," responded Romney.\par \par \uc2 But Cain's unlikely rise from asterisk in the polls to contender was clearly on the minds of his rivals on stage in a hotel along the Las Vegas Strip.\par \par \uc2 Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota led the verbal assault moments after the debate began, saying his call for a 9 percent federal sales tax would only be the beginning, with the rate rising later.\par \par \uc2 Former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania wasn't nearly as gentle, citing one analysis that found that taxes would go up for 84 percent of the nation's households if Cain's proposal went into effect. "We're talking about major increases in taxes," he said, adding that a single person and a couple with children with the same income would pay the same tax under Cain's proposal.\par \par \uc2 Undeterred, Cain insisted the charges were untrue. He said he was being criticized because lobbyists, accountants and others "want to continue to be able to manipulate the American people with a 10-million- word mess," the current tax code.\par \par \uc2 Cain's proposal is for a 9 percent personal income tax, a 9 percent corporate tax and a 9 percent national sales tax.\par \par \uc2 The former pizza company CEO is the latest and unlikeliest phenomenon in the race to pick a Republican rival for President Barack Obama. A black man in a party that draws few votes from Africans Americans, he had bumped along with little notice as Romney sought to fend off one fast-rising rival after another.\par \par \uc2 That all changed in the past few weeks, after Perry burst into the race and then fell back in the polls. However unlikely Cain's rise, Tuesday night's debate made clear that none of his rivals are willing to let him go unchallenged.\par \par \uc2 "Herman, I love you, brother, but let me tell you something, you don't need to have a big analysis to figure this thing out," Perry said to Cain. "Go to New Hampshire where they don't have a sales tax and you're fixing to give them one," he said, referring to the state that will hold the first primary early next year.\par \par \uc2 The debate was the fifth since Labor Day, and the last scheduled for nearly a month in a race that is fluid in more than one way.\par \par \uc2 While polls chart a series of rises and falls for various contenders -- Romney remaining at or near the top -- the schedule is far from set. Florida's decision to move up its primary set off a scramble as Iowa maneuvered to make sure its caucuses are the first real test of the race and New Hampshire works to protect its half-century distinction as host to the first primary.\par \par \uc2 It was Perry who instigated the confrontation over immigration, saying that Romney had no credentials on the issue because he had once hired an illegal worker, the "height of hypocrisy."\par \par \uc2 Romney denied the charge, saying he had hired a company to mow his lawn and did not know that it had an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  on its payroll.\par \par \uc2 The two men talked over one another, and at one point, Romney placed his hand on Perry's shoulder.\par \par \uc2 "It's been a tough couple of debates for Rick. And I understand that so you're going to get testy," he said.\par \par \uc2 As Perry continued to speak, Romney stopped him: "You have a problem with allowing someone to finish speaking, and I suggest that if you want to become president of the United States, you've got to let both people speak," he said.\par \par \uc2 On a more substantive level, Perry said he opposed repealing the portion of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution that says anyone born in the United States is automatically a citizen.\par \par \uc2 Bachmann, Santorum and Rep. Ron Paul of Texas all sidestepped the question.\par \par \uc2 Cain found himself on the defensive on two others issues during the two-hour debate.\par \par \uc2 He apologized for earlier remarks about building an electric fence on the Mexico border that could kill people trying to cross illegally.\par \par \uc2 And he said he wouldn't be willing to negotiate with terrorists, even though he suggested he might be in an interview earlier in the day.\par \par \uc2 Foreign policy took a secondary role in the debate, and the new strain of Republican isolationism quickly surfaced.\par \par \uc2 Paul said U.S. troops should be withdrawn from Korea -- where they have been stationed for more than 50 years -- and foreign aid to Israel cut.\par \par \uc2 Perry said it was "time to have a very serious discussion about defunding the United Nations."\par \par \uc2 Former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman skipped this debate, saying he was boycotting the Nevada caucuses in a dispute over the primary and caucus calendar. He is campaigning exclusively in New Hampshire in hopes of a victory that can move him into the thick of the race.\par \par \uc2 Not only Republicans, but Obama was also critical of Cain's economic plan during the day.\par \par \uc2 In an interview with ABC News, Obama said it would be a "huge burden" on middle-class and working families.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writer Steve Peoples in Washington contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 5\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020111019e7aj0000a\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

(AP) - An \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  died from exposure in the southern Arizona desert over the weekend and two others were rescued before succumbing to the heat, the Border Patrol said Monday.\par \par \uc2 Agents in Nogales in southeastern Arizona found a 26-year-old Mexican man unconscious in the desert Friday afternoon, Border Patrol spokesman Brent Cagen said.\par \par \uc2 He was airlifted to a nearby hospital but died Saturday.\par \par \uc2 Cagen said that the man's cousin was with him and didn't need medical attention. The cousin told agents that smugglers abandoned the pair when his cousin couldn't keep up.\par \par \uc2 "These smuggling organizations are just very callous when bringing people across the border," he said. "They have very little regard for human life. If they have to leave a person, it's a few less dollars in their pocket.\par \par \uc2 On Sunday, agents in Casa Grande saved two immigrants.\par \par \uc2 The first was a 39-year-old woman who was lost in the desert and called 911; she was later processed for removal after a medical evaluation.\par \par \uc2 The second was a 38-year-old man suffering from severe dehydration and heat exposure. He was flown to a hospital while the five other illegal immigrants in his group were processed for removal.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020111017e7ah002l6\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) - The murder mystery of a man who owned a ghost town near the New Mexico-Arizona line remains unsolved four months after he was found shot to death, and investigators say the case has stalled.\par \par \uc2 "We need help," said Capt. Ryan Suggs of the New Mexico State Police. "We need to turn up a new lead."\par \par \uc2 The body of Larry Link, 68, and a small-caliber revolver nearby were found by his son on June 7 just outside his property in Steins, a town of about 5,000 that borders Arizona. Link and his wife Linda were the longtime owners of Steins Railroad Ghost Town.\par \par \uc2 Suggs told the Las Cruces Sun-News ( {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://bit.ly/p9KLV8"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://bit.ly/p9KLV8}}}\uc2 ) that the only people who have been ruled out in the killing are Link's family members.\par \par \uc2 The death initially lit up the Internet with innuendo about border violence, creating a wave of speculation on blogs and comment boards that an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  likely was to blame. The town is about 80 miles north of Mexico.\par \par \uc2 State police Lt. Tim Johnson said those assertions had no substance and that investigators never had a suspect or a specific lead. He said the migrant claims died down after police made fact-based announcements about the investigation intended to squelch rumors.\par \par \uc2 Link's daughter said she would find it hard to believe that her father died at the hands of an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "In my experience, they are the least threatening thing out here," Pamela Link said of immigrants who cross illegally into Hidalgo County. "Everyone I've ever seen wanted one of three things: a drink of water, a sandwich or a ride to a big city."\par \par \uc2 She said she also didn't believe the motive was robbery because her father's wallet was on the nightstand, and added that he had no enemies: "My father, he would have given anybody anything. There was no reason to shoot him."\par \par \uc2 Link had worked as a butcher and in the grocery business in Arizona before he moved to New Mexico to start a rattlesnake farm. He raised the reptiles to sell their skin and meat before he bought Steins Railroad Ghost Town in 1988.\par \par \uc2 The ghost town -- a tourist draw with an old West history -- was Link's family business for 20 years. He and his wife closed it in 2008, but his working life went on. For 18 years, he ran a 24-hour business in which he fumigated and cleansed citrus fruit of parasites to make sure it was in compliance with Arizona and California law.\par \par \uc2 Pamela Link said fumigation takes three-and-a-half hours and requires substantial paperwork. She said that she was sure her father did not have a customer at the time he was killed.\par \par \uc2 Link suffered from insomnia, so his nights were fractured into periods of sleeplessness. On the morning that his body was found, Link's wife of 50 years saw him in his chair around 2:30 a.m., awake and restless. They blew each other a kiss for the last time.\par \par \uc2 Link must have ventured outside between then and 6 a.m. but it was unclear why. Once outside, he got about 200 yards from his house, Suggs said.\par \par \uc2 Pamela Link said that the family hoped for an arrest and conviction, and offered a reward of up to $2,000 for information leading to his killer. She said that her father's home used to be peaceful.\par \par \uc2 "Now it's nothing but fear," she said. "The only way to get through it every day is to breathe. We tell ourselves we have to breathe."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Information from: Las Cruces Sun-News, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.lcsun-news.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.lcsun-news.com}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020111017e7ah001yj\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

(AP) -- Oklahoma wide receiver Ryan Broyles has become the NCAA's career leader with his 317th catch during the first half of Saturday night's game against Kansas.\par \par \uc2 Broyles broke the receptions record set by Purdue's Taylor Stubblefield in 2004.\par \par \uc2 The senior from Norman, Okla., set the record with a 57-yard touchdown catch from Landry Jones with 7:50 remaining in the first half. Broyles caught the pass in stride on a post route and ran untouched into the end zone. It was his fourth catch of the night.\par \par \uc2 Broyles, who's averaged more than seven catches per game in his career, also moved into first place on the Big 12's career TD reception list with 43. He had been tied with former Oklahoma State wide receiver Rashaun Woods.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Kline ethics case unlikely to affect his teaching\par \par \uc2 KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- The dean of the Liberty University School of Law said former Kansas Attorney General Phill Kline's ability to teach at the Christian school in Virginia is unlikely to be affected by the outcome of an ethics case against him.\par \par \uc2 A state professional ethics panel recommended last week that Kline's Kansas law license be indefinitely suspended because of his conduct during criminal investigations of abortion providers. Kline has denied any wrongdoing, but others said he allowed his anti-abortion beliefs to influence his work as a prosecutor.\par \par \uc2 The Kansas Supreme Court will make the final decision on any sanctions. Kline has already allowed his Kansas law license lapse.\par \par \uc2 Mathew Staver, the law school dean, told The Kansas City Star ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://bit.ly/rn80Vvhttp://bit.ly/rn80Vv"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://bit.ly/rn80Vvhttp://bit.ly/rn80Vv}}}\uc2  ) that the school in Lynchburg, Va., founded by the late Rev. Jerry Falwell, has looked into the complaints against Kline, who is a visiting law professor. Staver said the allegations arose from a politically charged atmosphere in Kansas.\par \par \uc2 "We certainly would take any revocation of a license very seriously," Staver said. "At the same time, that particular incident was a number of years ago. What he's doing now really is unconnected to what he did back then as an attorney general or a district attorney."\par \par \uc2 Staver noted that Kline receives high reviews from students, saying "he's very engaged and engaging."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Kansas AG Schmidt understands budget constrains\par \par \uc2 TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) -- Attorney General Derek Schmidt understands the challenges facing Kansas law enforcement and prosecutors as budgets remain tight.\par \par \uc2 Fewer dollars available for putting officers on the streets or attorneys to file cases is a concern, he said, creating a delicate balance between spending and public safety.\par \par \uc2 Schmidt's agency oversees the Kansas Bureau of Investigation, which the first-term, Republican attorney general says is in need of additional resources for personnel and technology upgrades.\par \par \uc2 "The whole spectrum of public safety is really a core function of government," said Schmidt, a former state senator. "It ought to be the center of the priority lists."\par \par \uc2 He said he has witnessed as a legislator and now attorney general how budget decisions have affected jurisdictions statewide.\par \par \uc2 The issue of budgets for law enforcement came to a head this week in Topeka when the city council voted to repeal its domestic violence ordinance. The decision was prompted by a September decision by Shawnee County District Attorney Chad Taylor to announce he would stop reviewing and prosecuting municipal misdemeanors.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 US Supreme Court denies Kansas immigrant's appeal\par \par \uc2 WICHITA, Kan. (AP) -- An \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  sentenced to more than a decade in prison for repeatedly returning to the United States following deportation exhausted his appeals this week when the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear a Kansas case that now sets the standard in 10th Circuit federal district courts for what jurors must consider in deliberating criminal immigration verdicts.\par \par \uc2 Eusebio Sierra-Ledesma, a 73-year-old Mexican immigrant, was sentenced last year to a total of 127 months in prison for repeated illegal re-entry so flagrant that U.S. District Judge Monti Belot told him that he needed to "impress upon you the seriousness of your crime."\par \par \uc2 Sierra-Ledesma had been in immigration custody 19 times and had used more than 40 aliases, 10 false dates of birth and seven false Social Security numbers. His criminal record dating to 1964 included illicit drug sales, weapons crimes and immigration offenses.\par \par \uc2 His federal public defender, Timothy Henry, appealed his latest re-entry conviction on the grounds the court did not instruct the jury that the government had to prove the defendant "knowingly" intended to enter the United States\par \par \uc2 A three-judge panel of the 10th Circuit Court decided in June that Belot failed to make clear to the jury that prosecutors had to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant reentered the United States with the "intent" to do so. But the appeals court declined to overturn his conviction, finding the error was harmless since Sierra-Ledesma had never claimed he had re-entered the United States against his will.\par \par \uc2 The appeals court also noted that the evidence against him was overwhelming -- including his own sworn admission that he illegally re-entered after deportation -- finding that the jury verdict would have been the same regardless.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Mo. National Guard to help search for missing baby\par \par \uc2 KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon is sending members of the National Guard to Kansas City to help search for a missing baby.\par \par \uc2 Nixon said Saturday that 25 members of a guard police company will help look for Lisa Irwin, who was 10 months old when she was reported missing Oct. 4. Her parents say she disappeared from her crib sometime overnight.\par \par \uc2 Also Saturday, police searched an abandoned home after receiving a call about diapers and a backpack inside. But investigators say the items appear to have been in the house far longer than two weeks and likely wouldn't offer any evidence.\par \par \uc2 Police also say a homeless man seen in the neighborhood has been arrested on an outstanding warrant but isn't a suspect. Police want to question him as they had neighbors.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Kansas woman gets sorority invite on 90th birthday\par \par \uc2 TOPEKA, Kan.

Her late husband, Tom McConnell, built houses and ran a successful lumberyard in Lawrence for many years before working in the buildings and grounds department for The University of Kansas.\par \par \uc2 But her daughter, Judith McConnell-Farmer, the interim chairwoman of Washburn's department of education, said her mother never forgot her sorority dreams.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Patrol releases ID of man killed in Kan. shootout\par \par \uc2 DELPHOS, Kan.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) - Armando Cardenas says he has thought about leaving Alabama because of the possibility of being arrested as an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  and the hostility he feels from residents.\par \par \uc2 But now that a federal appeals court has sided with the Obama administration and dealt a blow to the state's toughest-in-the-nation immigration law, Cardenas said he will stay for at least a while longer.\par \par \uc2 "It's not easy to leave everything you have worked so hard for," Cardenas said after the appeals court blocked public schools from checking the immigration status of students.\par \par \uc2 The decision from the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals also said police can't charge immigrants who are unable to prove their citizenship, but it let some parts of the law stand, giving supporters a partial victory. The decision was only temporary and a final ruling isn't expected for months, after judges can review more arguments.\par \par \uc2 Unlike in other states where immigration crackdowns have been challenged in the courts, Alabama's law was left largely in effect for about three weeks, long enough to frighten Hispanics and drive them away from the state. Construction businesses said Hispanic workers had quit showing up for jobs and schools reported that Latino students stopped coming to classes.\par \par \uc2 While the long-range implications of the decision remain to be seen, immigrants celebrated the judges' ruling. Word spread quickly through the state's Hispanic community as Spanish-language radio stations aired the news.\par \par \uc2 "When I listened to that, I started crying. I called my friends and said, `Listen to the radio.' We're all happy," said Abigail, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who didn't want her last name used because she feared arrest.\par \par \uc2 The judges let stand part of the law that allows police to check a person's immigration status during a traffic stop. Courts also can't enforce contracts involving illegal immigrants, such as leases, and it's still a felony for an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  to do business with the state for basic things like getting a driver's license, the judges ruled. Their 16-page decision contained very little discussion about their ruling.\par \par \uc2 The Atlanta-based appeals court blocked part of the law that required school officials to verify the citizenship status of students enrolled after Sept. 1. It also barred enforcement of a section that lets police file a misdemeanor charge against anyone who is in the country illegally and doesn't have federal registration papers.\par \par \uc2 The Obama administration and a group of immigrant advocates such as the ACLU sued the state of Alabama after the law was passed in June. A federal judge upheld much of it late last month, and the Obama administration and the groups appealed.\par \par \uc2 Alabama Republicans said the law was needed to protect the jobs of legal residents. House Speaker Mike Hubbard, who championed the measure, praised the panel for allowing the "most effectual parts" of the law to remain in place.\par \par \uc2 "We've said from the beginning that Alabama will have a strict immigration law and we will enforce it. Alabama will not be a sanctuary state for illegal aliens, and this ruling reinforces that," he said.\par \par \uc2 Republicans in the state have long sought to clamp down on illegal immigration and passed the law earlier this year after gaining control of the Legislature for the first time since Reconstruction. Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley signed the measure, saying it was crucial to protect the jobs of legal residents amid the tough economy and high unemployment.\par \par \uc2 "Unfortunately, by failing to do its job, the federal government has left the problem of dealing with illegal immigration to the states," Bentley said in a statement. "Alabama needed a tough law against illegal immigration. We now have one. I will continue to fight to see this law upheld."\par \par \uc2 Advocacy groups who challenged the law said they were hopeful the judges will eventually block the rest of it.\par \par \uc2 "I think that certainly it's a better situation today for the people of Alabama today than it was yesterday," said Omar Jadwat, an attorney for the ACLU. "Obviously we remain concerned about the remainder of the provisions, and we remain confident that we will eventually get the whole scheme blocked."\par \par \uc2 It's not clear exactly how many Hispanics have fled the state, but earlier this week many skipped work to protest the law, shuttering or scaling back operations at chicken plants and other businesses.\par \par \uc2 Alabama's law is in the spotlight because it's the only state where some of the strictest provisions were allowed to play out.\par \par \uc2 Arizona led the nation in April 2010 when it passed a tough crackdown, but a judge blocked parts of it before it could take effect. Gov. Jan Brewer, a Republican, has appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, but the justices have yet to decide whether to take up the case.\par \par \uc2 A similar measure adopted in Utah earlier this year was put on hold by a federal judge in May after civil rights groups challenged it. Ditto for parts of new immigration laws passed by Georgia and Indiana.\par \par \uc2 South Carolina became a flashpoint this week when civil rights groups sued the state to block a law that takes effect in January, requiring police to check suspects' immigration status and mandating that all businesses check their hires through a federal online system.\par \par \uc2 The Justice Department called the Alabama law a "sweeping new state regime" and urged the appeals court to forbid states from creating a patchwork of immigration policies. Thomas Perez, head of the Justice Department's civil rights division, said he was particularly concerned about the school requirement.\par \par \uc2 "We're hearing a number of reports about increases in bullying that we're studying," said Perez, who said the government is trying to determine how many absences and withdrawals are linked to the law.\par \par \uc2 Some critics say the damage has already been done.\par \par \uc2 Nelly Tadeo, a legal U.S. resident from Mexico, said she notices icy stares in \uc2 Walmart\uc2  and feels like whites and blacks are wondering if she is legal and pays taxes.\par \par \uc2 "Even if the law gets canceled, Alabama is not going to be the same. Now, people are just looking at you like, `You're an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 ,'" said Tadeo. "I think that's permanent. A lot of people never thought about who was illegal, who was legal before. Now that's what they're thinking about."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Follow Bluestein at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.twitter.com/bluestein"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.twitter.com/bluestein}}}\uc2  and Reeves at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.twitter.com/Jay--Reeves"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.twitter.com/Jay--Reeves}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Bluestein reported from Atlanta.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) - In a blow to Alabama's toughest-in-the-nation immigration law, a federal appeals court sided with the Obama administration Friday when it blocked public schools from checking the immigration status of students.\par \par \uc2 The decision from the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals also said police can't charge immigrants who are unable to prove their citizenship, but it let some of the law stand, giving supporters a partial victory. The decision was only temporary and a final ruling wasn't expected for months, after judges can review more arguments.\par \par \uc2 Unlike crackdowns in other states, Alabama's law was left largely in effect for about three weeks, long enough to frighten Hispanics and drive them away from the state. Construction businesses said Hispanic workers had quit showing up for jobs and schools reported that Latino students stopped coming to class.\par \par \uc2 While the long-range implications of the decision remain to be seen, immigrants celebrated the judges' ruling. Word spread quickly through the state's Hispanic community as Spanish-language radio stations aired the news.\par \par \uc2 "When I listened to that, I started crying. I called my friends and said, `Listen to the radio.' We're all happy," said Abigail, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who didn't want her last name used because she feared arrest.\par \par \uc2 Before the ruling, Armando Cardenas said he was thinking about leaving Alabama because of the possibility of being arrested as an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  and the hostility he now feels from residents. Now, Cardenas said he will stay for at least awhile longer.\par \par \uc2 "It's not easy to leave everything you have worked so hard for," Cardenas said.\par \par \uc2 The judges let stand part of the law that allows police to check a person's immigration status during a traffic stop. Courts also can't enforce contracts involving illegal immigrants, such as leases, and it's still a felony for an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  to do business with the state for basic things like getting a driver's license, the judges ruled. Their 16-page decision contained very little discussion about their ruling.\par \par \uc2 The appeals court blocked part of the law that required school officials to verify the citizenship status of students enrolled after Sept. 1. It also barred enforcement of a section that let police file a misdemeanor charge against anyone who is in the country illegally and doesn't have federal registration papers.\par \par \uc2 The Obama administration and a group of immigrant advocates such as the ACLU sued the state of Alabama after the law was passed in June. A federal judge upheld much of it late last month, and the Obama administration and the groups appealed.\par \par \uc2 Alabama Republicans said the law was needed to protect the jobs of legal residents. House Speaker Mike Hubbard, who championed the measure, praised the panel for allowing the "most effectual parts" of the law to remain in place.\par \par \uc2 "We've said from the beginning that Alabama will have a strict immigration law and we will enforce it. Alabama will not be a sanctuary state for illegal aliens, and this ruling reinforces that," he said.\par \par \uc2 Republicans in the state have long sought to clamp down on illegal immigration and passed the law earlier this year after gaining control of the Legislature for the first time since Reconstruction. Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley signed the measure, saying it was crucial to protect the jobs of legal residents amid the tough economy and high unemployment.\par \par \uc2 "Unfortunately, by failing to do its job, the federal government has left the problem of dealing with illegal immigration to the states," Bentley said in a statement. "Alabama needed a tough law against illegal immigration. We now have one. I will continue to fight to see this law upheld."\par \par \uc2 Advocacy groups who challenged the law said they were hopeful the judges would eventually block the rest of it.\par \par \uc2 "I think that certainly it's a better situation today for the people of Alabama today than it was yesterday," said Omar Jadwat, an attorney for the ACLU. "Obviously we remain concerned about the remainder of the provisions, and we remain confident that we will eventually get the whole scheme blocked."\par \par \uc2 It's not clear exactly how many Hispanics have fled the state, but earlier this week many skipped work to protest the law, shuttering or scaling back operations at chicken plants and other businesses.\par \par \uc2 Alabama's law is in the spotlight because it's the only state where some of the strictest provisions were allowed to play out.\par \par \uc2 Arizona led the nation in April 2010 when it passed a tough crackdown, but a judge blocked parts of it before it could take effect. Gov. Jan Brewer, a Republican, has appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, but the justices have yet to decide whether to take up the case.\par \par \uc2 A similar measure adopted in Utah earlier this year was put on hold by a federal judge in May after civil rights groups challenged it. Ditto for parts of new immigration laws passed by Georgia and Indiana.\par \par \uc2 South Carolina became a flashpoint this week when civil rights groups sued the state to block a law that takes effect in January, requiring police to check suspects' immigration status and mandating that all businesses check their hires through a federal online system.\par \par \uc2 The Justice Department called the Alabama law a "sweeping new state regime" and urged the appeals court to forbid states from creating a patchwork of immigration policies. Thomas Perez, head of the Justice Department's civil rights division, said he was particularly concerned about the school requirement.\par \par \uc2 "We're hearing a number of reports about increases in bullying that we're studying," said Perez, who said the government is trying to determine how many absences and withdrawals are linked to the law.\par \par \uc2 Some critics say the damage has already been done.\par \par \uc2 Nelly Tadeo, a legal U.S. resident from Mexico, said she notices icy stares in \uc2 Walmart\uc2  and feels like whites and blacks are wondering if she is legal and pays taxes.\par \par \uc2 "Even if the law gets canceled, Alabama is not going to be the same. Now, people are just looking at you like, `You're an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 ,'" said Tadeo. "I think that's permanent. A lot of people never thought about who was illegal, who was legal before. Now that's what they're thinking about."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Follow Bluestein at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.twitter.com/bluestein"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.twitter.com/bluestein}}}\uc2  and Reeves at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.twitter.com/Jay--Reeves"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.twitter.com/Jay--Reeves}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Bluestein reported from Atlanta.

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc12}{\*\bkmkend toc12}\b \uc2 Florida Sen. Marco Rubio sidesteps immigration debate, but how much longer can he do that?\b0\par\par\uc2 By LAURA WIDES-MUNOZ   \par \uc2 AP Hispanic Affairs Writer\par \uc2 1,256 \uc2 words\par \uc2 13 October 2011\par 11:59\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2011.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 MIAMI (AP) - U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio is raising his national profile through a series of major policy speeches on the economy and America's role in the world.\par \par \uc2 But one issue Florida's freshman Republican doesn't spend much time discussing is immigration. That's despite the fact his parents came from Cuba and he represents the state with the third-largest number of illegal immigrants. The issue has also garnered recent attention in the Republican presidential primary campaign because Texas Gov. Rick Perry supports in-state college tuition for illegal immigrants, a position Rubio once supported.\par \par \uc2 Rubio will talk in generalities about immigration but as the charismatic 40-year-old lawmaker's prominence grows, he will likely face more scrutiny on the issue. Despite his denials of interest, he is one of many Republicans who get mentioned as possible vice presidential nominees next year, and recently announced plans for a memoir.\par \par \uc2 "At the national level, he's not going to get a pass as he did in his Senate election," said Frank Sharry of the Washington, D.C. based pro-immigrant group, "America's Voice. Sharry said Rubio's views on immigration and on making English the official language "are going to be lifted up to the diverse immigrant communities in Florida and to the largely Mexican-American communities in the West."\par \par \uc2 That is in part why talking about immigration is complicated for Rubio. He's the darling of tea party conservatives and generally favors their position of securing the border first and dealing with the country's more than 10 million illegal immigrants later. Republicans also are frank about the charismatic senator's ability to attract Latinos to the GOP, a factor that could play a key role in swing states like Colorado, New Mexico and Florida next year. Rubio speaks glowingly about his immigrant parents' struggles to rebuild their lives in the U.S.\par \par \uc2 Still, the country's mostly Mexican-American Latino voters tend to support immigration reform that covers both border security and a path to legalization for qualified illegal immigrants, rather than delaying the latter. Meanwhile, even Florida's influential Puerto Ricans, who are U.S. citizens, and its Cuban-American immigrants, who get special permission to remain in the U.S., tend to be more sympathetic to the plight of illegal immigrants than the general public. They are also more concerned about laws that require police to check suspects' citizenship, fearing they will be the victims of racial profiling.\par \par \uc2 Former State Rep. J.C. Planas, a Miami Republican and Rubio's longtime House colleague, says Rubio is being unfairly pressed on immigration because he's Hispanic. Planas supports comprehensive immigration reform but said the entire GOP has moved to the right on the issue, and Rubio's position merely reflects that shift.\par \par \uc2 Rubio is still relatively unknown among Latinos outside Florida, and immigration is hardly the only issue they or the rest of the nation will judge him on.\par \par \uc2 But Arturo Vargas, head of the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials, says it's natural for Latinos to look to Rubio for leadership on the issue.\par \par \uc2 "It's not unreasonable for people to hope that individuals who are immigrants or children of immigrants and in policy-making positions would be sympathetic to the plight of immigrants," he said. "It's not just about when you talk, it's about using your authority to help make the plight of those individuals better."\par \par \uc2 During an interview last week at the National Ideas Forum in Washington, Rubio spoke cautiously about his previous co-sponsorship in the Florida House of in-state college tuition for qualified illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Rubio said when the bill first came up, immigration "wasn't a big issue."\par \par \uc2 "As the years have gone on in the immigration issue has remain unresolved and in the minds of many gotten worse, and as the number of people in the country without documents grew from 8 million to 9 million to estimates of 11 million, it's been harder and harder to find some of these solutions," he said.\par \par \uc2 During the forum, he also expressed sympathy for high-achieving \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students who were brought to the U.S. at a young age by their parents and grew up here, but he did not say what he would do for them.\par \par \uc2 Asked by The Associated Press in an email what Rubio would support for such students or whether he still supports in-state tuition, spokesman Alex Contant said the senator would not expand on his forum comments.\par \par \uc2 Miami political consultant Anna Navarro said she believes Rubio is simply being strategic politically about when he speaks on the issue, especially given there has been little will in the House or Senate to pass a bill.\par \par \uc2 "I don't think he's going to stand up on a box and give a policy speech on immigration when there's absolutely no plan moving in Congress just for the sake of satisfying groups that want him to do it," she said.\par \par \uc2 Rubio's stance on immigration has gained notice in part because it deviates from that of many recent Florida GOP Hispanic leaders. His predecessor, former Sen. Mel Martinez, former U.S. Rep Lincoln Diaz-Balart and U.S. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, all Cuban-Americans, have led bipartisan efforts in favor of a comprehensive immigration bill.\par \par \uc2 Rubio did co-sponsor a bill this summer to increase the mandatory use of the government's computerized E-Verify program. E-verify allows companies to check whether new hires are eligible to work in the U.S. His support for the bill came even as a coalition of agriculture, hospitality and other Florida industry leaders helped defeat a similar bill at the state level.\par \par \uc2 At the same time, he has refused to be interviewed about immigration by the nation's largest Spanish-language network, Univision, whose audience tends to strongly support immigration reform. Univision averages about 4 million primetime viewers, compared to 1 million for its nearest competitor, Telemundo. Rubio has appeared on the equivalent programs for all the major English-language networks and Telemundo. The last time Rubio talked in-depth about immigration on Univision -- and then only to a reporter with a local Miami station -- was a few days after he took office last January.\par \par \uc2 Rubio's decision not to be interviewed by Univision became part of the news last week when his staff publicly accused the network of pressuring the senator to appear on its top news talk show in exchange for it softening a story about the decades-old drug trafficking conviction of Rubio's brother-in-law.\par \par \uc2 Univision denies the allegations.\par \par \uc2 That caused freshman U.S. Rep. David Rivera, a long-time Rubio ally and former Tallahassee roommate, to demand that the Republican presidential candidates boycott a proposed January debate on Univision. He threatened to "inform Hispanic voters, particularly Cuban-American voters, as to which presidential candidates chose to ignore our concerns and participate." Five of the candidates then announced they would boycott.\par \par \uc2 Whatever his future holds, Washington-based GOP political consultant Mercy Schlapp, said she and others interested in immigration will be watching him.\par \par \uc2 "Is he going to be one of those major players and be one of those helping to develop the policy," she questioned, "or is he going to sit on the sidelines?"\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020111013e7ad001k0\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) - Civil rights groups led by the American Civil Liberties Union are suing to prevent South Carolina's tougher new illegal immigration law from taking effect in January.\par \par \uc2 The lawsuit filed on Wednesday in a Charleston federal court is another legal challenge brought against states that passed ever-tougher illegal immigration laws, saying the federal government isn't doing enough to enforce its laws.\par \par \uc2 The lawsuit names Gov. Nikki Haley and state Attorney General Alan Wilson as defendants along with Charleston County's sheriff and a state prosecutor. The legal challenge had been expected since Haley signed the bill into law on June 27.\par \par \uc2 Haley spokesman Rob Godfrey pointed out that the governor is the daughter of legal immigrants and that the ACLU should butt out. Haley "understands that no American value is more sacred than the rule of law," Godfrey said. "That's what this is about -- nothing more, nothing less. And if the ACLU was really about what they claim to be, they'd stay out of our business and let us enforce our laws."\par \par \uc2 The South Carolina law requires police to check suspects' immigration status and mandates that all businesses check their hires through a federal online system. It is similar to those the ACLU is challenging in Alabama, Arizona, Utah, Indiana and Georgia.\par \par \uc2 In the lawsuit, the groups say that South Carolina violates the U.S. Constitution by attempting to regulate immigration, a "function that is constitutionally committed exclusively to the federal government."\par \par \uc2 State ACLU Executive Director Victoria Middleton said in a statement that "by requiring local law enforcement officials to act as immigration agents, this law invites discrimination against anyone who looks or sounds `foreign,' including American citizens and legal residents."\par \par \uc2 The groups said that the new law subjects citizens and others to unlawful interrogations, prolonged detentions, and arrests. "Individuals perceived as `foreign' by state or local law enforcement agents will be in constant jeopardy of harassment and unlawfully prolonged detention and arrest," the lawsuit said.\par \par \uc2 ACLU lawyer Andre Segura said in a statement the law needs to be blocked "as it tramples our American values, interferes with federal laws and risks turning South Carolina into a police state."\par \par \uc2 This week, the U.S. Department of Justice asked the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals to block enforcement of Alabama's law until an appeal can be heard. The court will have to decide whether to issue an injunction. A federal judge in Birmingham already as blocked parts of the law. The Justice Department says the U.S. Constitution doesn't give states the authority to deter illegal immigration or regulate an issue with foreign policy implications.\par \par \uc2 Advocacy groups have told the courts Latino residents in Alabama are being told they'd have water service cut off if they don't prove their immigration status.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020111012e7ac002z6\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ATLANTA (AP) - The federal government on Wednesday urged an appeals court to block enforcement of Alabama's strict law targeting illegal immigration, saying the statute oversteps the state's authority on the issue.\par \par \uc2 The filing with the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals came in response to a filing a day earlier by the state. The U.S. Department of Justice and a coalition of advocacy groups last week filed a request with the court to block officials in Alabama from enforcing the law pending the outcome of an appeal, saying the law could lead to discrimination against even legal residents. The court now has to decide whether it will intervene by issuing a preliminary injunction.\par \par \uc2 The law is considered one of the toughest in the nation. It requires officials to check the immigration status of public school students; allows police to hold suspected illegal immigrants without bond; bars state courts from enforcing contracts, like leases, that involve illegal immigrants; makes it a felony for an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  to do business with the state for basic things like obtaining drivers licenses; and makes it a misdemeanor for an illegal resident not to have immigration papers. A federal judge in Birmingham has blocked other sections of the law.\par \par \uc2 The Justice Department argues in its filing that the Constitution doesn't give Alabama authority to deter illegal immigration except through means provided by Congress and doesn't allow states "to regulate in an area fraught with foreign policy implications." It says Alabama's filing Tuesday "confirms that the purpose and effect of its newly enacted statute is to engage precisely in this type of regulation."\par \par \uc2 Alabama had argued in its filing that cooperation with federal officials on this issue and the identification and reporting of people violating federal immigration law fall well within its rights. The state also argued that the law shouldn't be blocked because the Justice Department and the advocacy groups failed to demonstrate that enforcing the law will cause irreparable harm.\par \par \uc2 In a separate filing Wednesday, the advocacy groups cited several specific examples of people they say have been affected by the law since it took effect last month and said it's audacious for the state to claim that "the crisis that is currently gripping Alabama" is not being caused by the new law and that it is being exaggerated.\par \par \uc2 They say Latino residents in Northport, Ala., have received notices that their water service would be cut off within two business days unless they provide proof of their immigration status. They mention a man in Jemison, Ala., who says he was arrested and detained for not having an alien registration document even though the arresting officer knew he was in immigration proceedings and that federal authorities had released him on bond. They say children, both citizens and non-citizens, are being intimidated from attending school.\par \par \uc2 Wednesday's filings were not immediately available online but groups challenging the law provided copies.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020111012e7ac002ah\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ATLANTA (AP) - Alabama asked a federal appeals court Tuesday to allow the state to enforce much of its strict law targeting illegal immigration, and state officials tried to clear up confusion over the crackdown among court officials and police.\par \par \uc2 The state said in arguments that the Justice Department and a coalition of advocacy groups failed to demonstrate that enforcing the law will cause irreparable harm. The state argued the U.S. District Court in Birmingham considered hundreds of pages of briefs, almost nine hours of oral arguments and more than six weeks of consideration before it upheld parts of the law.\par \par \uc2 The Justice Department and the advocacy groups have until Wednesday morning to file a response. After that, the court could decide whether to intervene by issuing a preliminary injunction.\par \par \uc2 The law requires officials to check the immigration status of public school students, allows police to hold suspected illegal immigrants without bond and bars state courts from enforcing contracts such as leases involving illegal immigrants. It also makes it a felony for an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  to do business with the state for basic things like obtaining drivers licenses and a misdemeanor for an illegal resident not to have immigration papers.\par \par \uc2 "Does it really cause harm to the United States when a state informs the federal government of persons who are in violation of federal law, and then leaves it to the federal government to decide whether to initiate deportation proceedings? Does it really harm the United States for the state to gather information about how much it is spending to educate illegally-present children? Of course not," Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange wrote in the filing.\par \par \uc2 The Justice Department and the coalition of groups asked the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals last week to block the law, at least temporarily, saying it could lead to discrimination against even legal residents. The Justice Department said the law, considered by many to be the most stringent immigration measure in the country, could cause considerable fallout as immigrants flee to other states or their native countries.\par \par \uc2 The coalition of advocacy groups said the law has thrown Alabama into "chaos" and left some Hispanics too afraid to go to their jobs and reluctant to send their kids to school.\par \par \uc2 Some in Alabama's Hispanic community are encouraging Spanish-speaking residents and their supporters to skip work Thursday and Friday to protest the law and show that Hispanics are an important part of Alabama's economy.\par \par \uc2 Parts of the law that took effect last month after a federal judge upheld them help make the Alabama law stricter than similar laws enacted in Arizona, Utah, Indiana and Georgia. Federal judges in those states have blocked all or parts of those laws.\par \par \uc2 Convictions for violating the law have already been reported. Authorities told The Decatur Daily ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://bit.ly/njed6u"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://bit.ly/njed6u}}}\uc2 ) that four people arrested during traffic stops late Sunday and early Monday were convicted on charges of failing to have the proper immigration documents. Each agreed to pay $300 in fines and city court costs, and a judge sentenced them to suspended 30-day jail terms and probation. Authorities were holding the four for federal immigration officials.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, there has been confusion among courts and law enforcement agencies about how to enforce the law. The Administrative Office of Courts has issued a memo to court magistrates statewide telling them they don't have to jail people who can't prove their citizenship with a driver's license. It says magistrates can release people on bond while authorities are verifying whether they are U.S. citizens. All the person has to do to be freed is sign his or her name.\par \par \uc2 The president of the state police chiefs association, Terry Davis, said Tuesday the advice should ease fears of jails filling up.\par \par \uc2 "I had a chief call me and say he had an officer spend more than three hours on the phone trying to call all these numbers to get information," said Davis, police chief in the northeast Alabama town of Boaz.\par \par \uc2 The state Homeland Security agency has sent a memo to law enforcement agencies explaining parts of the law, and Strange's office will hold a summit on Thursday that will include a session about it.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 AP writer Jay Reeves in Birmingham, Ala., contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020111011e7ab002sy\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 FRESNO, Calif. (AP) - A California native who grew up picking vegetables with his migrant parents and then soared over the same fields as an astronaut aboard the International Space Station announced plans Tuesday to run for Congress in the state's newly formed 10th District.\par \par \uc2 Jose Hernandez told a crowd of about 75 people outside Modesto's City Hall that he was proof the American dream was still alive.\par \par \uc2 "I went from plowshares to the stars," Hernandez said with his wife beside him.\par \par \uc2 Hernandez, a self-described moderate Democrat, earned an electrical engineering degree at the University of the Pacific in Stockton and a master's from UC Santa Barbara. The Central Valley native worked for the U.S. Department of Energy at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, learned to speak Russian, coordinated Russian and U.S. nuclear arsenals, and applied 12 times to astronaut school before being accepted at age 41.\par \par \uc2 "I've worked hard and haven't taken any shortcuts, and I've got this country to thank for it," Hernandez, 49, told The Associated Press before his formal announcement Tuesday. "It has been possible in this country for people like me to live the American Dream, and that's what I want to make sure I preserve."\par \par \uc2 As the U.S. space program began transitioning into its post-shuttle form, Hernandez spent a year at NASA headquarters working with members of Congress on space policy issues out of the office of legislative and intergovernmental affairs. That's where the political bug bit him.\par \par \uc2 "I was able to walk the halls of Congress and get a good feel for how they work," Hernandez said. "I'm coming into this with my eyes wide open."\par \par \uc2 Hernandez, who has never held office, will face freshman lawmaker Jeff Denham, R-Atwater, if no other Democrat files. Voter registration in the district, which includes Stanislaus County and the southern San Joaquin County, gives Democrats an advantage of 42 percent versus 37 percent.\par \par \uc2 He is receiving help from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and already has hired a campaign manager with experience getting political novices elected. A.J. Carrillo guided Jerry McNerney to an upset of the DCCC-backed candidate in the 11th District in 2006. McNerney went on to upset Republican Rep. Richard Pombo.\par \par \uc2 President Barack Obama himself encouraged Hernandez to run for the seat when the two met after the former astronaut received an award from the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute. First lady Michelle Obama offered to come to the district and help him campaign, Hernandez said.\par \par \uc2 He said he will campaign on ending the military presence in Iraq and Afghanistan at the agreed upon times so that the $10 billion spent annually rebuilding those countries can be invested back home.\par \par \uc2 "Enough is enough. It's time we start building our own infrastructure. Instead of raising taxes we need to look at where we are spending money and how we can redirect it to help our country," he said.\par \par \uc2 Hernandez said it's unreasonable to think that 12 million \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  workers in the U.S. can be deported. He wants the nation to invest in science and said he would work to lure high tech jobs to Central California. Congress has too many lawyers, he adds, and could use an engineer like him who is trained to solve problems.\par \par \uc2 "I would call myself a moderate Democrat," he said. "I agree on being fiscally responsible, but at the same time I also agree we need many of the social programs that we have. It's a delicate balance, but it can work if we are smarter about how we allocate our resources."\par \par \uc2 Hernandez has resigned from his job at a Houston high tech firm and is moving his family to the San Joaquin Valley, where he visits often and still has family. He serves on the Board of Regents at the University of the Pacific in Stockton and runs his Reach For the Stars foundation, which helps low-income students attend college.\par \par \uc2 Hernandez was born in nearby French Camp and grew up speaking Spanish and picking vegetables alongside his parents, who taught him that by working hard in school he could have a different future. He dreamed of space, and his parents encouraged him to develop a plan to reach that goal. The family eventually settled in Stockton after living in Modesto and Tracy.\par \par \uc2 After college became a pilot and a certified scuba diver. Eventually NASA's Johnson Space Center offered him a job as a research engineer. Four years later he was selected for astronaut training.\par \par \uc2 He is looking in the Turlock-Modesto area for a house with his wife, Adela, and their five children who range in age from 8 to 17.\par \par \uc2 "I'm a son of the Valley," he said. "We are ready to come home."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press photographer Ben Margot in Modesto contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020111011e7ab002lu\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 HELENA, Mont. (AP) - Lewis and Clark County officials have issued an arrest warrant for an Irish man who police say wrote bad checks in Montana totaling more than $55,000 and then fled to Colorado.\par \par \uc2 Authorities are also seeking to extradite Kevin Barry McAuley from Colorado where he was being held by federal officials following his arrest on Sept. 1 for being in the United States illegally. On Thursday he pleaded guilty in federal court in Colorado to that charge.\par \par \uc2 "I filed a complaint for writing bad checks, common scheme, which is a felony," said Mike Menahan, deputy attorney in Lewis and Clark County. "We are willing to bring him back here."\par \par \uc2 The Independent Record reports ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://bit.ly/qNjrCj"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://bit.ly/qNjrCj}}}\uc2 ) that McAuley was sentenced to the time he's served since his arrest, and that he was turned over to the Department of Homeland Security for deportation. It's unclear if McAuley will return to Montana because immigration officials want to deport him.\par \par \uc2 But a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security said it's possible the agency could postpone the deportation in such a situation.\par \par \uc2 "They simply need to file a claim, and the person can be transported there if they have to face charges," said Shawn Neudauer. "All violations, like weapons or drunk driving are separate from federal immigration law."\par \par \uc2 But he also said that illegal immigrants, unless their crimes rise to a serious level, are typically deported.\par \par \uc2 "Standard operation procedure for Immigration and Customs Enforcement is to let the third-party nation sort it out with the country of origin," Neudauer said.\par \par \uc2 Dan Mohn, a Canyon Ferry resident who said he loaned McAuley about $8,000, would like to see McAuley returned to Montana to face charges.\par \par \uc2 "I would like to see him spend some time in jail," Mohn said. "He's been scamming people for a long time now. I'd like to tell him to his face what I think about him."\par \par \uc2 McAuley told Montana residents he was an Irish soldier who fought in Lebanon, Kuwait and Afghanistan, and that his father owned pubs and hotels in Ireland.\par \par \uc2 Police say some residents believed the story and McAuley was able to scam money, housing and other items from about half a dozen people. But the story came apart when his fingerprints were put through federal computer files as part of a domestic assault arrest.\par \par \uc2 From that officials learned he was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , and he fled to Colorado, where he was arrested.\par \par \uc2 On another front, some residents of Reykjavik, Iceland, say McAuley took advantage of them in 2009.\par \par \uc2 "He was looking to take over an Irish pub, whose owner he had got to know through his mingling with us locals," said Frederik Krautwald, executive director of a computer programming company, in the email to the newspaper.\par \par \uc2 Krautwald said he was conned into helping McAuley form a business plan. He said McAuley fled in the night, but not before breaking into the pub and taking $1,000.\par \par \uc2 "I have heard from the owner that Kevin lured huge amounts from him," Krautwald said. "For the last two years I have been trying to find McAuley and information on me. Perhaps it would be nice for the people around Canyon Ferry Reservoir to know that they are not alone being victims to his fraud."\par \par \uc2 McAuley could not be reached for comment by The Associated Press on Sunday.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Information from: Independent Record, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.helenair.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.helenair.com}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020111009e7a90049f\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc19}{\*\bkmkend toc19}\b \uc2 Illegal immigrants make plans for kids' care if they are arrested, deported under new Ala. law\b0\par\par\uc2 By JAY REEVES   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 1,233 \uc2 words\par \uc2 9 October 2011\par 09:17\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2011.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) - Terrified by Alabama's strict new immigration crackdown, parents living in the state illegally say they are doing something that was unthinkable just days ago -- asking friends, relatives, co-workers and acquaintances to take their children if they're arrested or deported.\par \par \uc2 Many illegal immigrants signed documents in the past week allowing others to care for their children if needed, assistance groups say, and a couple living illegally in nearby Shelby County extracted a promise from the man's boss to send their three young children -- all U.S. citizens -- to Mexico should they be jailed under the law.\par \par \uc2 A key sponsor of the measure, state Sen. Scott Beason, said such concerns weren't raised when legislators were considering the bill, and he wonders if the stories now are designed to "pull on heart strings" and build sympathy for illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 But for Maria Patino -- who prays every time she leaves home -- even a chance encounter with police could end with her two elementary-age children being left alone or taken to foster care if she and her husband are sent back to Mexico. Both are in the country illegally and have no friends or relatives close enough to take in the kids.\par \par \uc2 "Every time I leave I don't know if I will come back," Patino, 27, said through tears. "I can't stop working. My daughters need shoes and other things."\par \par \uc2 Social worker Jazmin Rivera helps dozens of Spanish-speaking immigrants fill out paperwork weekly, and many are now seeking legal documents called powers of attorney so friends and others could care for their children.\par \par \uc2 "People are scared, and they want to be sure their kids are safe if something happens to them," said Rivera, a case manager at the Hispanic Interest Coalition of Alabama.\par \par \uc2 Beason, R-Gardendale, has his doubts about how widespread such cases really are.\par \par \uc2 "I would do whatever it took for my family to stay with me," he said. "It's beyond my comprehension that you would just leave your children anywhere."\par \par \uc2 Alabama's law, regarded by many as the toughest in the U.S., was passed by the Republican-controlled Legislature this year and signed by Gov. Robert Bentley. A federal judge blocked some parts of it but allowed key pieces to stand -- including a provision that allows police to hold suspected illegal immigrants without bond. On Friday, the U.S. Justice Department and civil rights groups asked a federal appeals court to block the law, saying it could lead to discrimination against even legal residents.\par \par \uc2 However, the law will remain in effect at least until Nov. 29, when the appeals court said it would hear oral arguments.\par \par \uc2 Immigrant parents say that leaves them little choice other than to seek out people to care for their children because they fear the youngsters -- many of whom are U.S. citizens -- will be left home alone or sent to foster care if they are suddenly nabbed under the law.\par \par \uc2 Cristian Gonzalez, 28, said she has informally asked the manager of the rental property where she lives to take care of her 10-year-old daughter should she and her husband be arrested because they are illegal immigrants. The girl, a U.S. citizen who has medals for making good grades, needs to finish school in America and is deeply rooted in Alabama, she said.\par \par \uc2 Gonzalez said their other three kids are too young to remain and will go back to Mexico with her and her husband even though they are U.S. citizens.\par \par \uc2 "We're afraid to go back to Mexico because of the drugs, the cartels and the killings," Gonzalez said. "And we are afraid to stay here because of the law."\par \par \uc2 Mexican authorities have struggled in the fight against drug cartels known for carrying out brutal killings as they try to tighten control over territory. Authorities say that country's drug war has claimed thousands of lives.\par \par \uc2 Under the law, police making traffic stops can question anyone suspected of being in the country illegally and jail them without bond if they lack proof of citizenship. Many police agencies say they have yet to begin enforcing the law because officers haven't been trained in all of its intricacies.\par \par \uc2 Still, fear runs deep among people living in the state without visas, passports, driver licenses and other documents.\par \par \uc2 Patino isn't sure what would happen to her kids if she is arrested. Neither is stay-at-home mom Cristian Carraon, who is in the country illegally yet is married to a U.S. citizen and has three children -- 8, 5 and 3 -- who also are citizens.\par \par \uc2 "My husband works from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. If I get deported, who is going to take care of my kids?" she said.\par \par \uc2 Illegal immigrants interviewed by The Associated Press repeatedly said they crossed the border illegally because they were poor and could not meet U.S. visa requirements to have stable jobs, bank accounts and property in Mexico. U.S. officials ask for those things to ensure people who obtain a visa have roots in Mexico and plan to return. Parents said they came to provide a better future than their children could ever have in Latin America.\par \par \uc2 Now, Lety Garcia and her husband are hoping the powers of attorney they signed for each other will allow the children to remain out of foster care should either or both be arrested.\par \par \uc2 "We are living day to day because we do not know what will happen tomorrow," Garcia, who identified herself as an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , said through a translator. "Every time I go out of my house I pray to God, `Help us come back.'"\par \par \uc2 It's not just parents who are worried about their children. Young people fear what might happen to their parents.\par \par \uc2 Jose Perez's mother and father brought him into the U.S. from his native Mexico when he was a toddler, and he is now a 15-year-old high school student living in Alabama illegally. Perez -- with a Southern accent and dreams of becoming a nurse someday -- fears being forced to return to a country he doesn't know, and he is afraid what could happen to his parents if they are detained.\par \par \uc2 Perez already has seen the family of a good friend split up because some members were illegal residents and fled back to Mexico.\par \par \uc2 "It was horrible having to see a friend that I consider almost like a sister cry her eyes out as she is being forced to say goodbye to her little sister and her mom," said Perez, 15, who lives with his parents and older brother in suburban Birmingham.\par \par \uc2 As the lawsuits seeking to block the law play out in court, Maria Azamar is praying the law is stopped. Azamar, who said she is living in the U.S. illegally, already has had one daughter deported and now is caring for her 4-year-old granddaughter under a power of attorney document.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) - Illegal immigrants can now apply for state-funded scholarships and aid at state universities after Gov. Jerry Brown announced Saturday that he has signed the second half of a legislative package focused on such students.\par \par \uc2 AB131 by Assemblyman Gil Cedillo, D-Los Angeles, is the second half of the California Dream Act. Brown signed the first half of the package in July, which approved private scholarships and loans for students who are illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Under current law, \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students who have graduated from a California high school and can prove they're on the path to legalize their immigration status can pay resident tuition rates. The bill would allow these students to also apply for state aid.\par \par \uc2 The contentious second half of the package requires that immigrant students meet the same requirements as all other students applying for financial aid at state universities but specifies that they only qualify for financial aid after all the other legal residents have applied.\par \par \uc2 "The signing of now both parts of the California Dream Act will send a message across the country that California is prepared to lead the country with a positive and productive vision for how we approach challenging issues related to immigration," Cedillo said.\par \par \uc2 "Dreams can come true. We have proved it today," he said.\par \par \uc2 Twelve other states, including Texas, New York and Washington, have passed similar legislation allowing \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students to apply for in-state tuition.\par \par \uc2 The bills are different from the federal Dream Act, which includes a path to citizenship for the children of illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Brown said the bill expands educational opportunities for all qualified students.\par \par \uc2 "Going to college is a dream that promises intellectual excitement and creative thinking," he said. "The Dream Act benefits us all by giving top students a chance to improve their lives and the lives of all of us."\par \par \uc2 Critics of the bills say it undermines immigration laws and encourages illegal immigration by granting access to state resources reserved for legal residents. Many Republican lawmakers say legal students have had their grants cut in light of recent budget cuts to higher education.\par \par \uc2 Assemblyman Tim Donnelly, R-Hesperia, said the bill's passage will the biggest mistake the Democratic Party makes.\par \par \uc2 "The polling indicates that 80 to 90 percent of Californians are against this, and it crosses party lines," Donnelly said. He said he hopes to get a ballot initiative overturning the law started as soon as the bill is officially included in state statutes. He said the bill encourages illegal immigration because it creates an entitlement program for the thousands of immigrants looking for a way to stay in the country.\par \par \uc2 "It is absolutely, fundamentally wrong and unfair and it is an insult to people who have worked and played by the rules, including those who have come to this country legally," he said.\par \par \uc2 Ginny Rapini, coordinator for the NorCal Tea Party Patriots, said there should be consequences for illegal immigrants and giving them an education funded by California taxpayers isn't fair to the legal residents who can't afford to pay for their own tuition.\par \par \uc2 "What part of illegal do we not get? When people come here illegally they need to come here with the same rules and regulations that other people came here with," Rapini said.\par \par \uc2 Supporters argue that children whose were brought to the U.S. illegally by their parents shouldn't be punished.\par \par \uc2 Cedillo said the legislation will make California more competitive in the global economy by educating a workforce that has already shown resilience and leadership. Bad immigration policy has been hurting the economy, he said.\par \par \uc2 Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa said the bill "invests in the dreams of talented undocumented students and in the economic future of our state."\par \par \uc2 The state Department of Finance estimates that 1 percent of all Cal Grant funds, the state student financial aid program, will be affected by the legislative package when it goes into effect in January 2013. The department says that 2,500 students would qualify for aid under the bill and estimates the costs to equal $14.5 million of a $1.4 billion program.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020111009e7a9000a8\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) - Illegal immigrants can now apply for state-funded scholarships and aid at state universities after Gov. Jerry Brown announced Saturday that he has signed the second half of a legislative package focused on such students.\par \par \uc2 AB131 by Assemblyman Gil Cedillo, D-Los Angeles, is the second half of the California Dream Act. Brown signed the first half of the package in July, which approved private scholarships and loans for students who are illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Under current law, \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students who have graduated from a California high school and can prove they're on the path to legalize their immigration status can pay resident tuition rates. The bill would allow these students to also apply for state aid.\par \par \uc2 The contentious second half of the package requires that immigrant students meet the same requirements as all other students applying for financial aid at state universities but specifies that they only qualify for financial aid after all the other legal residents have applied.\par \par \uc2 "The signing of now both parts of the California Dream Act will send a message across the country that California is prepared to lead the country with a positive and productive vision for how we approach challenging issues related to immigration," Cedillo said.\par \par \uc2 "Dreams can come true. We have proved it today," he said.\par \par \uc2 Twelve other states, including Texas, New York and Washington, have passed similar legislation allowing \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students to apply for in-state tuition.\par \par \uc2 The bills are different from the federal Dream Act, which includes a path to citizenship for the children of illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Brown said the bill expands educational opportunities for all qualified students.\par \par \uc2 "Going to college is a dream that promises intellectual excitement and creative thinking," he said. "The Dream Act benefits us all by giving top students a chance to improve their lives and the lives of all of us."\par \par \uc2 Critics of the bills say it undermines immigration laws and encourages illegal immigration by granting access to state resources reserved for legal residents. Many Republican lawmakers say legal students have had their grants cut in light of recent budget cuts to higher education.\par \par \uc2 Assemblyman Tim Donnelly, R-Hesperia, said the bill's passage will the biggest mistake the Democratic Party makes.\par \par \uc2 "The polling indicates that 80 to 90 percent of Californians are against this, and it crosses party lines," Donnelly said. He said he hopes to get a ballot initiative overturning the law started as soon as the bill is officially included in state statutes. He said the bill encourages illegal immigration because it creates an entitlement program for the thousands of immigrants looking for a way to stay in the country.\par \par \uc2 "It is absolutely, fundamentally wrong and unfair and it is an insult to people who have worked and played by the rules, including those who have come to this country legally," he said.\par \par \uc2 Ginny Rapini, coordinator for the NorCal Tea Party Patriots, said there should be consequences for illegal immigrants and giving them an education funded by California taxpayers isn't fair to the legal residents who can't afford to pay for their own tuition.\par \par \uc2 "What part of illegal do we not get? When people come here illegally they need to come here with the same rules and regulations that other people came here with," Rapini said.\par \par \uc2 Supporters argue that children whose were brought to the U.S. illegally by their parents shouldn't be punished.\par \par \uc2 The state Department of Finance estimates that 1 percent of all Cal Grant funds, the state student financial aid program, will be affected by the legislative package when it goes into effect in January 2013. The department says that 2,500 students would qualify for aid under the bill and estimates the costs to equal $14.5 million of a $1.4 billion program.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020111008e7a8002w4\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ATLANTA (AP) - The federal government asked an appeals court Friday to stop Alabama officials from enforcing a strict immigration law that has already driven Hispanic students from public schools and migrant workers from towns, warning that it opens the door to discrimination against even legal residents.\par \par \uc2 The Department of Justice's filing to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals also said the law, considered by many to be the most stringent immigration measure in the country, could cause considerable fallout as immigrants flee to other states or their native countries.\par \par \uc2 A coalition of advocacy groups also filed a separate appeal Friday that claims the law has thrown Alabama into "chaos" and left some Hispanics too afraid to go to their jobs and reluctant to send their kids to school.\par \par \uc2 The court signaled in an order Friday that it wouldn't decide whether to halt the law until it reviews more arguments from both sides next week. The state must file a brief by Tuesday, and the government must respond by Wednesday. After that, the court could decide whether to intervene by issuing a preliminary injunction.\par \par \uc2 In the meantime, Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley said he intends to continue enforcing the hotly disputed law, which allows authorities to detain people suspected of being in the country illegally and lets officials check the immigration status of students in public schools.\par \par \uc2 Those measures took effect last week after a federal judge upheld them, and they help make the Alabama law stricter than similar laws enacted in Arizona, Utah, Indiana and Georgia. Federal judges in those states have blocked all or parts of those measures.\par \par \uc2 Justice Department attorneys outlined several problems they have with the Alabama overhaul.\par \par \uc2 They worry the law is likely to expose legal residents "to new difficulties in routine dealings" and could force federal authorities to deal with low-risk immigrants rather than the most dangerous criminals. And, they say, the attempt to drive illegal immigrants "off the grid" could disrupt both diplomatic relationships and national policy.\par \par \uc2 "Other states and their citizens are poorly served by the Alabama policy, which seeks to drive aliens from Alabama rather than achieve cooperation with the federal government to resolve a national problem," the filing said.\par \par \uc2 Immigration has become a hot-button issue in Alabama over the past decade as the state's Hispanic population has grown by 145 percent to about 185,600. U.S. Census figures show the group represents about 4 percent of the state population, but some counties in north Alabama have large Spanish-speaking communities and schools where most of the students are Hispanic.\par \par \uc2 State Republicans have long sought to clamp down on illegal immigration and passed the law earlier this year after gaining control of the Legislature for the first time since Reconstruction. Bentley soon signed the measure, saying it was crucial to protect the jobs of legal residents amid the tough economy.\par \par \uc2 Alabama House Speaker Mike Hubbard said the state was forced to act because the federal government ignored its responsibility to enforce immigration law.\par \par \uc2 "In Alabama we believe in obedience to law because it promotes fairness and protects the rights of everybody," said Hubbard, a Republican. "That's why instead of just talking about it, we took action to ensure nobody is allowed to cheat the system and ignore our laws."\par \par \uc2 The measure has had an immediate impact.\par \par \uc2 Education officials say scores of immigrant families have withdrawn their children from classes or kept them home from school. Some towns and urban areas have also reported a sudden exodus of Hispanics, some of whom told officials they planned to leave the state to avoid trouble with the law.\par \par \uc2 To cope with the labor shortage, Alabama agriculture commissioner John McMillan suggested Friday that farmers should consider hiring the 2,300 or so inmates in the state's work-release program.\par \par \uc2 U.S. District Judge Sharon Blackburn last month blocked some of the strictest portions of the crackdown, including a part that forbids drivers from stopping along a road to hire temporary workers, a ban on businesses from receiving tax deductions for wages paid to illegal workers and a provision that makes it a crime for an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  to solicit work.\par \par \uc2 But the judge let other portions of the law stand, asserting that several groups failed to show they met the legal standards to block the law. That coalition, which filed a separate lawsuit, filed its appeal late Friday.\par \par \uc2 The 11th Circuit's order, which came hours after the appeals were filed, also agreed to expedite a hearing on the case. It said it would hold oral arguments on the dispute no earlier than Nov. 29.\par \par \uc2 Allison Neal of the American Civil Liberties Union of Alabama, which was part of the coalition that sued, said she hopes the "11th Circuit will act quickly on this because of the real harm we are seeing here in Alabama."\par \par \uc2 Legal experts say they expect the Supreme Court to eventually weigh in on the issue, but are still uncertain which state will win the race to the court.\par \par \uc2 "Whether the Alabama one is heard or not, I can't predict. But until there's greater clarity from Congress or the court, there's going to be more appeals," said Doug Towns, an Atlanta lawyer who specializes in immigration employment law. "Opponents say this creates a patchwork approach to immigration policy, and ultimately that needs to be considered by the U.S. Supreme Court."\par \par \uc2 The Justice Department's challenge called the Alabama law a "sweeping new state regime" and urged the appeals court to forbid states from creating a patchwork of independent immigration policies. It also said the law could strain diplomatic relations with Latin American countries, who have warned the law could impact millions of workers, tourists and students in the U.S.\par \par \uc2 The law, it said, turns illegal immigrants into a "unique class who cannot lawfully obtain housing, enforce a contract, or send their children to school without fear that enrollment will be used as a tool to seek to detain and remove them and their family members."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writer Phillip Rawls in Montgomery, Alabama, contributed to this report.

Staley last month allowed Colotl to enter the pretrial program that would have allowed Colotl to avoid a criminal conviction.\par \par \uc2 The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://bit.ly/olkmLM"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://bit.ly/olkmLM}}}\uc2 ) that Staley vacated her order to dead-docket the case after reading that the sheriff didn't approve of the decision.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Information from: The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.ajc.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.ajc.com}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020111007e7a7001u9\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 LOS ANGELES (AP) - A Latino media group on Thursday urged a radio station to pull two popular talk radio hosts off the air after an advocate for immigrant rights reported receiving a barrage of threats from the program's fans.\par \par \uc2 The National Hispanic Media Coalition said it would target advertisers of the "John and Ken Show" and urge them to stop backing the program.\par \par \uc2 The coalition said in a statement that the hosts promote hate speech and had urged listeners to call and harass the advocate about state legislation to give financial aid to \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  college students.\par \par \uc2 The advocate received more than 450 abusive and threatening calls, said the group, which accused the show of creating an atmosphere of hate and intolerance. The advocate's phone numbers were provided by the talk show hosts, the coalition said.\par \par \uc2 "We've come too far as the Latino community to be treated the way they treat us," said Rosalia Tenorio, the coalition's director of communications.\par \par \uc2 Greg Ashlock, market president of Clear Channel's eight local radio stations, said John Kobylt and Ken Chiampou, the hosts of the show on KFI AM 640, went on the air and told fans they don't advocate making threats.\par \par \uc2 "If we believe there is a trend or a consistency of behavior that we think steps outside the boundaries of kind of the freedoms they have as hosts then we'll address that," Ashlock said\par \par \uc2 However, he said people listen to the show to hear passionate opinions.\par \par \uc2 "There's a reason KFI is called `more stimulating talk radio,'" Ashlock said. "It is not just news reporting. It is because it is going to generate a response one way or the other."\par \par \uc2 The hosts often rail against taxes and illegal immigration. Ashlock said it's the most popular talk show during the afternoon commute.\par \par \uc2 Ashlock said he cancelled a meeting Thursday with the coalition because the hosts will not be fired. He said he would meet with other Latino groups to discuss any community concerns.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020111007e7a70004k\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) - Some Hispanic parents are returning their children to Alabama's public schools after initially keeping them at home over fears about the state's tough new immigration law. Others are withdrawing their children in preparation for moving out of state.\par \par \uc2 There are no statewide figures yet on withdrawals, but some schools with large Hispanic populations have seen more than 10 percent of their students leave.\par \par \uc2 "They seem to be taking the law seriously enough to move out of state," Enterprise Superintendent of Education Aaron Milner said Thursday.\par \par \uc2 Out of the 34,652 Hispanic students in Alabama's public schools, 1,357 were absent Wednesday. That was down from a high of 2,285 on Monday, the state Department of Education reported.\par \par \uc2 The decline came after state and local education officials used news releases, videos and school assemblies to assure Hispanic parents that the schools would not be used to arrest anyone for being an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "We believe our efforts may have helped to dismay confusion and fear. We will continue to do more to reach out and let all students and parents know they are welcome in Alabama's public schools," department spokeswoman Malissa Valdes said.\par \par \uc2 The department won't have withdrawal numbers until around Oct. 17, she said.\par \par \uc2 But a check with school systems found some Hispanic families are leaving.\par \par \uc2 At Foley Elementary School, one of the most heavily Hispanic schools in southwest Alabama, principal Bill Lawrence said Thursday that 25 students have withdrawn and he expects another 40 to withdraw, based on discussions with their parents.\par \par \uc2 That would be about one-fourth of his Hispanic enrollment.\par \par \uc2 "The part that is driving this is fear," he said.\par \par \uc2 In Enterprise, the superintendent said his system had more than 250 Hispanic students before the law took effect. As of Thursday, 32 had withdrawn and 37 were absent. "We've had several miss multiple days and we do not know their status," Milner said.\par \par \uc2 Milner said withdrawals will affect future funding from the state for hiring teachers because the funding is based on a school's average daily enrollment.\par \par \uc2 "That 32 students could be as much as two teacher units," he said.\par \par \uc2 A federal judge allowed portions of Alabama's immigration law to take effect last week. One provision requires schools to check the legal status of new students when they enroll. Then they report numbers, but not names, to state education officials in Montgomery.\par \par \uc2 In Foley, Lawrence said his typical Hispanic student was born in the U.S., usually in Foley, but one or both of their parents were not. Lawrence said parents are frightened to drive their children to school because the law that allows police to hold motorists who can't produce documents to show they are legal residents.\par \par \uc2 "The fear is you are going to be pulled over, detained and deported," he said.\par \par \uc2 No state agency is compiling records on how many people have been detained so far, and a spokesman for U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement said the agency had no totals.\par \par \uc2 In Calhoun County, Sheriff Larry Amerson said during the first week the law was in effect, his officers made routine traffic stops with three Hispanic motorists who couldn't produce driver's licenses, car registration records or liability insurance records. His department sent their names and fingerprints to ICE and was told to hold only one. He said having three traffic stops in one week with no IDs is normal for his county, which includes Anniston and Jacksonville.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020111006e7a6002j9\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Gov. Andrew Cuomo ordered state agencies Thursday to translate documents and provide interpreters in six languages for immigrants seeking public services.\par \par \uc2 The $1.5 million effort covered by state and federal funds will also provide the translations to illegal immigrants, depending on what services they seek, Cuomo said. Immigrants won't be asked about their federal immigration status.\par \par \uc2 The project will translate documents and websites from agencies including social services and motor vehicles into Spanish, Chinese, Italian, Russian, French and French Creole. The group New York Lawyers for the Public Interest estimates 2.5 million immigrants in New York require help understanding English. The new initiative includes state workers as translators and translators from a hired service.\par \par \uc2 Cuomo said state government for too long made immigrants responsible for learning enough English to apply for public services.\par \par \uc2 "It's government's responsibility to figure out how to communicate with the person," Cuomo said.\par \par \uc2 "This is the problem with government today," said state Conservative Party Chairman Michael Long. "We try to do everything for everybody. When immigrants came here at one time, they focused on learning English as fast as possible so they could assimilate into the American culture.\par \par \uc2 "This is only enabling people to not try to assimilate because the government will take care of them, which is only increasing the cost of government," Long said.\par \par \uc2 Alabama recently enacted laws that require police to act if they suspect someone of being an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , businesses to check the legal status of workers and schools to report the immigration status of students. Supporters said the measures were prompted by lack of enforcement of laws against illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 Cuomo said the "New York experience" is different.\par \par \uc2 "Most of us are immigrants that made this state the greatest state in the country, we're proud of it," Cuomo said, opening his news conference in Italian. "We invite people here ... so to the extent we can expedite and facilitate communication among our family members, that's exactly what we're going to do."\par \par \uc2 Secretary of State Cesar Perales said children of immigrants have often had to act as interpreters, relaying to officials why their mothers need government help to feed their families. He called it "one of the greatest indignities" he ever saw.\par \par \uc2 Some Republican senators had complained in 2009 that a measure to translate ballots into Russian was a Democratic attempt to register more Democrats among New York City's growing Russian population. Spanish-speaking New Yorkers, those from Puerto Rico as well as immigrants, have usually provided a strong Democratic vote in New York.\par \par \uc2 There was no immediate comment from the current Republican majority in the Senate.\par \par \uc2 The Legislature, led by Latino lawmakers, had pushed several times for the translations, but the bills were rejected by previous governors as too expensive.\par \par \uc2 The Cuomo administration says the $1.5 million interpreter contract using current employees would have to be extended in the 2012-13 budget due in April. The service provides a way for state agencies to translate applications and documents and to contact state workers who are interpreters in various languages.\par \par \uc2 Cuomo said the money can be found in the state's $137 billion budget, even with a projected $2 billion deficit.\par \par \uc2 "New York state government simply cannot do its job if it cannot communicate with millions of New Yorkers who need to report crimes, or seek vital services," said Javier Valdes, deputy director of Make the Road New York, an immigrants' advocacy group.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020111006e7a60021e\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc28}{\*\bkmkend toc28}\b \uc2 As new immigration law in Alabama takes effect, construction and farm workers flee\b0\par\par\uc2 By PHILLIP RAWLS   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 979 \uc2 words\par \uc2 5 October 2011\par 21:19\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2011.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) - Alabama's strict new immigration law may be backfiring. Intended to force illegal workers out of jobs, it is also driving away many construction workers, roofers and field hands in the country legally who do backbreaking jobs that Americans generally won't.\par \par \uc2 The vacancies have created a void that will surely deal a blow to the state's economy and could slow the rebuilding of Tuscaloosa and other tornado-damaged cities.\par \par \uc2 Employers believe they can carry on because of the dismal economy, but when things do turn around, they worry there won't be anyone around to hire. Many legal Hispanic workers are fleeing the state because their family and friends don't have the proper papers and they fear they will be jailed.\par \par \uc2 Rick Pate, the owner of a commercial landscaping company in Montgomery, lost two of his most experienced workers, who were in the country legally. He spent thousands of dollars training them to install irrigation systems at places like the Hyundai plant.\par \par \uc2 "They just feel like there is a negative atmosphere for them here. They don't feel welcome. I don't begrudge them. I'd feel nervous, too," Pate said.\par \par \uc2 While it's not clear how many of an estimated 185,000 Hispanic people in the state have fled, one estimate figured as much one-fourth of the commercial building work force had left since the law was upheld last week, said Bill Caton, president of Associated General Contractors of Alabama. Commercial construction is a more than $7 billion-a-year industry in Alabama.\par \par \uc2 Legislators said the law would help legal residents suffering from nearly 10 percent unemployment.\par \par \uc2 One of the bill's authors, Republican Sen. Scott Beason, said he expected short-term problems, but he has received "thank you" calls from two people who replaced illegal immigrants who fled their jobs. Beason predicts that trickle will become a rush.\par \par \uc2 "We have the best law in the country and I stand by what we've done," Beason said.\par \par \uc2 Some farmers disagreed.\par \par \uc2 On Chandler Mountain in north Alabama, tomato farmer Lana Boatwright said only eight of the 48 Hispanic workers she needed for harvest showed up after the law took effect. Those who did were frightened.\par \par \uc2 "My husband and I take them to the grocery store at night and shop for them because they are afraid they will be arrested," she said.\par \par \uc2 Farmer Chad Smith said his family farm stands to lose up to $150,000 because there are not enough workers to pick tomatoes spoiling in the fields.\par \par \uc2 "We will be lucky to be in business next year," he said.\par \par \uc2 The financial toll will vary by area, and experts said it's too early to make predictions.\par \par \uc2 The law allows police to detain people indefinitely if they are suspected of being in the country illegally and requires schools to check the status of new students when they enroll. Those elements make it perhaps the toughest law in nation.\par \par \uc2 The law targets employers by forbidding drivers from stopping along a road to hire temporary workers. It also bars businesses from taking tax deductions for wages paid to illegal workers and makes it a crime for an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  to solicit work. A federal judge has temporarily blocked those sections of the law so she can study them more.\par \par \uc2 Cristian Gonzalez, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Mexico, is a stay-at-home mother of four who lives in a mobile home in suburban Birmingham with her husband. They sneaked across the border in 2009 and planned to save money and eventually return to their home country.\par \par \uc2 "We're afraid to go to \uc2 Walmart\uc2 . I'm afraid to walk the kids up there to get the bus. I am afraid to drive," Gonzalez said.\par \par \uc2 Her husband worked as a brick mason and cook, but was recently unemployed. Now they have decided they probably will return to Mexico.\par \par \uc2 "We're just trying to be here one more year, but with this law ..." she said, her voice trailing off as she shook her head.\par \par \uc2 In Tuscaloosa, there is still a lot of rebuilding to be done after Alabama's killer tornadoes in April. Without the Hispanic workers to help out, it will take even longer for neighborhoods to be fixed up. Blake Corder, the president of the Home Builders Association of Tuscaloosa, noted that the workers had left the area and he even lost a few renters in the past week.\par \par \uc2 Likewise, schools are worried about their students who have suddenly stopped showing up for class. Out of 34,000 Hispanic students, 2,285 were absent Monday. That number increased from Friday by a few hundred.\par \par \uc2 The figures show seven out of every 100 Hispanic children were out of school, even though state school officials have tried to assure parents that they won't release their names to police and that no child will be denied an education due to legal status.\par \par \uc2 At Gonzalez' mobile home community, driveways were full of cars and trucks at midday Tuesday, a time when most residents used to be at work. A resident who didn't want to be identified out of fear of the law said people are afraid to venture out during daylight.\par \par \uc2 "People are just not going to work. They don't want to be arrested," the woman said.\par \par \uc2 Builders have complained they can't find replacement workers and delays in projects are expected. Once the economy picks up and construction returns to normal, the impact will increase, said Russell Davis, executive vice president of the Home Builders Association of Alabama.\par \par \uc2 "There is going to be a void. No question," Davis said.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writers Jay Reeves in Birmingham, Ala., and Dave Martin in Steele, Ala., contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020111006e7a60003g\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

Brown\b0\par\par\uc2 By STEVE LeBLANC   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 907 \uc2 words\par \uc2 4 October 2011\par 23:01\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2011.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 LOWELL, Mass. (AP) - The six Democratic candidates for U.S. Senate spent much of their first debate zeroing in on the one candidate not on stage, Republican Sen. Scott Brown.\par \par \uc2 All six argued that they were their party's best hope to unseat the popular incumbent, who won a special election last year for the seat left vacant by the death of longtime Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy.\par \par \uc2 Harvard law professor and consumer advocate Elizabeth Warren, the frontrunner in a recent poll, faulted Brown for cozying up to Wall Street. If elected, Warren said, her top goals would be lowering the national jobless rate and helping the middle class find a more solid economic footing.\par \par \uc2 "People should not be on unemployment," she said. "We should be putting them to work."\par \par \uc2 She also said the country shouldn't put future wars "on a credit card," referring to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.\par \par \uc2 "We should never go to war if we're not willing to pay for it now," she said. "It means either all of us go to war or none of us go to war."\par \par \uc2 The other Democratic candidates largely passed on any opportunity to confront Warren directly. A recent poll found Warren far ahead of the other candidates in a matchup with Brown.\par \par \uc2 Self-described "social justice advocate" Robert Massie, however, warned against what he called a "rush to judgment" among Democrats to support one candidate -- presumably Warren, who just announced her candidacy and is largely untested on the campaign trail.\par \par \uc2 But even Massie saved his toughest critique for Brown, attributing his surprise win to an insurgent national conservative movement.\par \par \uc2 "Scott Brown raised $14 million in the last 18 days of his campaign because he was able to appeal to the tea party who wanted to slap Massachusetts in the face for 47 years of Teddy Kennedy," he said.\par \par \uc2 City Year co-founder Alan Khazei, who raised nearly $1 million during his first fundraising quarter, also went after the Republican incumbent, saying Brown has failed to live up to his early promise in the Senate.\par \par \uc2 "Scott Brown had an opportunity to be a game changer," Khazei said. "He's delivered nothing."\par \par \uc2 The debate also gave some of the lesser-known candidates a chance to make their case to Democratic primary voters.\par \par \uc2 Immigration attorney Marisa DeFranco said she can fight Brown in one of his strongholds in Essex County. She also said she's made a living battling for underdogs and would give Brown a run for his money.\par \par \uc2 "I know how to beat Scott Brown on his own turf," she said.\par \par \uc2 State Rep. Tom Conroy said he's the only candidate with a record of having defeated a popular GOP incumbent. Compared to him, Brown would come across as "nothing more than an empty suit," Conroy said.\par \par \uc2 "I'm the Democratic Party's best hope to defeat Scott Brown," said Conroy, D-Wayland.\par \par \uc2 Newton resident Herb Robinson tried to cast himself as the non-politician in the group. He was also the only candidate to say he would support full legalization of marijuana. Most of the other candidates said they could support some form of medical marijuana use.\par \par \uc2 Marijuana "should be legal and sold as alcohol," Robinson said.\par \par \uc2 All six said they agree that President Barack Obama has been too slow in getting the country out of Afghanistan and agreed that women should be allowed combat roles in the military. All said they opposed mandatory military service.\par \par \uc2 Asked if they had ever been cited for drunken driving, all six said no.\par \par \uc2 All the candidates said they paid for their education through a mix of student loans, jobs and financial from their parents.\par \par \uc2 "I kept my clothes on," said Warren, a joking reference to Brown's decision while in law school to pose nude for Cosmopolitan magazine in a photo spread with a strategically placed crease in the magazine.\par \par \uc2 All the Democratic candidates also said they believe Congress needs to pass comprehensive immigration policy and would support offering in-state tuition rates to \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students living in Massachusetts.\par \par \uc2 The Democratic candidates also said they support Obama's jobs bill, although several said the bill was not aggressive enough.\par \par \uc2 Asked what superhero they would want to be, Conroy said Captain America, DeFranco said one of the Wonder Twins, Khazei said the Flash, Robinson said the Incredible Hulk, Massie said Superman and Warren said Wonder Woman, citing her "cool outfit."\par \par \uc2 A recent UMass Lowell-Boston Herald poll showed Brown getting 41 percent of the vote and Warren receiving 38 percent, within the poll's margin of error.\par \par \uc2 Warren also was the strong favorite of the six Democratic candidates when pollsters surveyed potential Democratic primary voters. She garnered 36 percent of the vote while none of the other five got more than 5 percent.\par \par \uc2 The poll surveyed 1,005 registered voters in Massachusetts by landline and cellphone from Sept. 22-28. The margin of error was 3.8 percentage points, higher for smaller samples such as potential Democratic primary voters.\par \par \uc2 Brown has tried to cast himself as an independent voice beholden to neither major political party.\par \par \uc2 "I'm going to continue to do my job and work on the very important things that people care about and that's jobs, job creation," he told reporters Monday.\par \par \uc2 5\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020111005e7a500043\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) - Alabama's strict new immigration law may be backfiring. Intended to force illegal workers out of jobs, it is also driving away many construction workers, roofers and field hands in the country legally who do backbreaking jobs that Americans generally won't.\par \par \uc2 The vacancies have created a void that will surely deal a blow to the state's economy and could slow the rebuilding of Tuscaloosa and other tornado-damaged cities.\par \par \uc2 Employers believe they can carry on because of the dismal economy, but when things do turn around, they worry there won't be anyone around to hire.\par \par \uc2 Rick Pate, the owner of a commercial landscaping company in Montgomery, lost two of his most experienced workers, who were in the country legally. He spent thousands of dollars training them to install irrigation systems at places like the Hyundai plant.\par \par \uc2 "They just feel like there is a negative atmosphere for them here. They don't feel welcome. I don't begrudge them. I'd feel nervous, too," Pate said.\par \par \uc2 While it's not clear how many of an estimated 185,000 Hispanic people in the state have fled, one estimate figured as much one-fourth of the commercial building work force had left since the law was upheld last week, said Bill Caton, president of Associated General Contractors of Alabama. Commercial construction is a more than $7 billion-a-year industry in Alabama.\par \par \uc2 Legislators said the law would help legal residents suffering from nearly 10 percent unemployment.\par \par \uc2 One of the bill's authors, Republican Sen. Scott Beason, said he expected short-term problems, but he has received "thank you" calls from two people who replaced illegal immigrants who fled their jobs. Beason predicts that trickle will become a rush.\par \par \uc2 "We have the best law in the country and I stand by what we've done," Beason said.\par \par \uc2 Some farmers disagreed.\par \par \uc2 On Chandler Mountain in north Alabama, tomato farmer Lana Boatwright said only eight of the 48 Hispanic workers she needed for harvest showed up after the law took effect. Those who did were frightened.\par \par \uc2 "My husband and I take them to the grocery store at night and shop for them because they are afraid they will be arrested," she said.\par \par \uc2 Farmer Chad Smith said his family farm stands to lose up to $150,000 because there are not enough workers to pick tomatoes spoiling in the fields.\par \par \uc2 "We will be lucky to be in business next year," he said.\par \par \uc2 The financial toll will vary by area, and experts said it's too early to make predictions.\par \par \uc2 The law allows police to detain people indefinitely if they are suspected of being in the country illegally and requires schools to check the status of new students when they enroll. Those elements make it perhaps the toughest law in nation.\par \par \uc2 The law targets employers by forbidding drivers from stopping along a road to hire temporary workers. It also bars businesses from taking tax deductions for wages paid to illegal workers and makes it a crime for an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  to solicit work. A federal judge has temporarily blocked those sections of the law so she can study them more.\par \par \uc2 Cristian Gonzalez, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Mexico, is a stay-at-home mother of four who lives in a mobile home in suburban Birmingham with her husband. They sneaked across the border in 2009 and planned to save money and eventually return to their home country.\par \par \uc2 "We're afraid to go to \uc2 Walmart\uc2 . I'm afraid to walk the kids up there to get the bus. I am afraid to drive," Gonzalez said.\par \par \uc2 Her husband worked as a brick mason and cook, but was recently unemployed. Now they have decided they probably will return to Mexico.\par \par \uc2 "We're just trying to be here one more year, but with this law ..." she said, her voice trailing off as she shook her head.\par \par \uc2 In Tuscaloosa, there is still a lot of rebuilding to be done after Alabama's killer tornadoes in April. Without the Hispanic workers to help out, it will take even longer for neighborhoods to be fixed up. Blake Corder, the president of the Home Builders Association of Tuscaloosa, noted that the workers had left the area and he even lost a few renters in the past week.\par \par \uc2 Likewise, schools are worried about their students who have suddenly stopped showing up for class. Out of 34,000 Hispanic students, 2,285 were absent Monday. That number increased from Friday by a few hundred.\par \par \uc2 The figures show seven out of every 100 Hispanic children were out of school, even though state school officials have tried to assure parents that they won't release their names to police and that no child will be denied an education due to legal status.\par \par \uc2 At Gonzalez' mobile home community, driveways were full of cars and trucks at midday Tuesday, a time when most residents used to be at work. A resident who didn't want to be identified out of fear of the law said people are afraid to venture out during daylight.\par \par \uc2 "People are just not going to work. They don't want to be arrested," the woman said.\par \par \uc2 Builders have complained they can't find replacement workers and delays in projects are expected. Once the economy picks up and construction returns to normal, the impact will increase, said Russell Davis, executive vice president of the Home Builders Association of Alabama.\par \par \uc2 "There is going to be a void. No question," Davis said.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writers Jay Reeves in Birmingham, Ala., and Dave Martin in Steele, Ala., contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020111005e7a5003en\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The Oklahoman. Oct. 5, 2011.\par \par \uc2 Governor's bridge plan an effort to get to finish line\par \par \uc2 Legislation approved six years ago gave Oklahoma a good start toward repairing or replacing its structurally deficient bridges. A plan proposed by Gov. Mary Fallin looks to get us to the finish line sooner rather than later.\par \par \uc2 Fallin wants to, over several years, increase the amount of money directed from the general revenue fund to the Rebuilding Oklahoma Access and Driver Safety (ROADS) fund, which was formed in 2005 as part of a sweeping transportation bill. If all goes according to plan, the number of deficient bridges in the state would drop to nearly zero by 2019.\par \par \uc2 It's a bold idea, given the state of the budget in recent years and the continued tough economy. However, Fallin's office points out that much of the additional transportation funding would come from growth revenue, and Oklahoma has enjoyed nice growth in revenue this fiscal year.\par \par \uc2 The proposal was questioned by the Oklahoma Policy Institute, which is concerned about diverting income tax revenue from an already thin budget. Fallin's spokesman, Alex Weintz, countered that an effort to fix bad bridges "does not reflect a lack of commitment to other areas of government."\par \par \uc2 To be sure, Fallin and legislative leaders must look out for education, public safety and other vital state services. Sturdy, safe bridges are vital too, and Oklahoma has too many that aren't. This proposal would reduce that number, benefiting motorists and truckers across the state. The details need to be worked out during budget negotiations next year, but here's hoping the plan comes to pass.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Tulsa World. Oct. 3, 2011.\par \par \uc2 Oklahoma's anti-immigration law tough enough\par \par \uc2 Finally, some reason and common sense has come from the state Capitol concerning immigration law.\par \par \uc2 Rep. Charles Ortega, R-Altus, House chairman of the legislative joint immigration committee, recently said that no sweeping changes are needed in Oklahoma's already tough anti-immigration laws.\par \par \uc2 That, no doubt, is going to draw some heavy criticism from the anti-immigration crowd. He is, however, correct and a welcome voice of reason in what has been a storm of false charges and disturbing hyperbole throughout Oklahoma's dealings with its Hispanic population, both legal and illegal.\par \par \uc2 Ortega said that the existing House Bill 1804 is broad enough that more such laws would be not only redundant but expensive. Again, he is correct. HB 1804 was written with a broad brush and continues to cost taxpayers money in the court system.\par \par \uc2 Ortega also addressed a very important part of anti-\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  legislation. "When you go to criminalizing people, when you go to criminalizing businesses, when you go to disrupting lives, we better be careful where we tread in that area."\par \par \uc2 Much of the anti-immigrant law has been pushed by people who simply will not accept those who are different. They blame the woes of the state and the country on illegal immigrants. They continue to claim that they are a drain on the economy and that they are receiving government help. Most of their claims are untrue.\par \par \uc2 Illegal immigrants do pay taxes. A study in 2007 showed that they paid as much as $45 million in sales and income taxes. They also pay property taxes through their rent.\par \par \uc2 Everyone, even the Hispanic community, agrees that the state and the nation has a problem with illegal immigration. Most also agree that it is a federal problem that ought to be addressed by Congress rather than a patchwork of onerous state laws.\par \par \uc2 Ortega is talking sense. We hope people are listening.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 The Norman Transcript. Oct. 1, 2011.\par \par \uc2 Retirement system fix is a good first step\par \par \uc2 Reducing the unfunded liability of the state teachers retirement system will help reassure Oklahoma educators that their pensions are safe. Lawmakers took care of that by raising the age limit for full retirement benefits and by requiring that any cost of living raises be tied to a funding source.\par \par \uc2 The system's director told The Associated Press that the unfunded liability has dropped from more than $10.4 billion to $7.6 billion. In addition, the system is enjoying higher rates of investment return.\par \par \uc2 If trends continue, the retirement fund will go from one of the nation's worst to one of its best in the next 22 years. The system's unfunded liability could be eliminated by then.\par \par \uc2 But two other things need to happen before Oklahoma teachers regain some respect at the Capitol. A funding source needs to be identified to allow lawmakers to grant cost of living raises to retirees. Inflation will eat up pensions, forcing many of the beneficiaries to struggle with finances in their retirement years.\par \par \uc2 Second, lawmakers shouldn't continually beat up on public school teachers. There will come a day when few college students will choose careers in education. It may already be happening. Salaries for Oklahoma teachers have improved over the years, but public school teachers wrongly bear the blame for many of society's ills.\par \par \uc2 Teaching positions are often the first positions to be eliminated in troubled economic times. The pension fix is a good first start, and it doesn't balance the books on the backs of current retirees as much as it does on future ones.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020111005e7a5002jt\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 CHICAGO (AP) - The release of more than 40 suspected illegal immigrants jailed in Cook County on felonies has added fuel to a contentious debate over public safety and local authorities' defiance of a White House program that aims to pursue more criminal deportations.\par \par \uc2 The program depends on police and sheriff's deputies to hold suspected illegal immigrants who get arrested beyond the time when they would otherwise be released. But commissioners in the county around Chicago recently adopted a new law that orders the sheriff to ignore all federal requests to detain immigrants after they complete their sentences or post bail.\par \par \uc2 Other places, such as San Francisco, have taken similar measures, part of a backlash against the Obama administration, which many say is unfairly seeking to deport immigrants accused of traffic violations and other minor offenses. But Cook County's new ordinance is the first to forbid a sheriff from holding suspected felons as well as those accused of misdemeanors.\par \par \uc2 "It puts residents at risk, and it puts my police officers at risk," said Rod Craig, mayor of Hanover Park in suburban Chicago, who is livid about the release of three suspected illegal immigrants charged with assaulting two officers and trying to take one of their guns.\par \par \uc2 Detaining the immigrants is supposed to give federal agents time to pick up the suspects and begin the deportation process. But one after another, local governments have complained about that the Secure Communities program, which gives immigration agents access to fingerprints collected at jails. They say the practice costs too much money and treats immigrants unfairly, especially those accused of only small-time offenses such as shoplifting, traffic violations or drunken driving.\par \par \uc2 Some states have pulled out of the program. In Illinois, for instance, Gov. Pat Quinn declared the government would not cooperate. New York's governor also suspended participation. And in San Francisco, the sheriff refuses to honor detention requests from the Customs and Immigration Enforcement for illegal immigrants charged with misdemeanors.\par \par \uc2 In Cook County, which is overwhelmingly Democratic and has seen rapid growth in its Latino population, commissioners on both side of the issue captured the anger and fears that are being voiced far beyond the Chicago area.\par \par \uc2 "What we are doing is righting a wrong against people who are on the soil of Cook County under the protection of the U.S. Constitution," said Commissioner Larry Suffredin, a Democrat who supported the measure.\par \par \uc2 Why, asked Jesus Garcia, the commissioner who sponsored the ordinance, should immigrants be treated any differently than anyone else who has been arrested?\par \par \uc2 "By refusing to detain people who are entitled to their freedom, based merely on a request from (immigration agents) we are upholding our system of justice..." he said in a statement.\par \par \uc2 Another commissioner warned that the board was putting people in danger -- and risking a firestorm of negative publicity if someone who is released commits a violent crime.\par \par \uc2 Less than a month after the board acted, more than 40 suspected illegal immigrants charged with or convicted of felonies have walked to freedom instead of into the arms of federal agents, according to the sheriff's department.\par \par \uc2 "This is our Willie Horton moment in Cook County," warned Commissioner Timothy Schneider, a Republican who voted against it. He was referring to a convicted killer who was released as part of a Massachusetts prison furlough program and then raped a woman. The case was used to devastating effect in 1988, when George H.W. Bush's presidential campaign revealed that his opponent, Michael Dukakis, supported the program when he was Massachusetts governor.\par \par \uc2 Schneider and others say that all the ordinance has done is squander an opportunity to keep dangerous felons off the streets. Immigration officials agree that it raises the risk that criminals known to be dangerous will be freed.\par \par \uc2 Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart has been relatively quiet. After it became clear that the board was going to go further than his staff recommended, Dart's representative would not say anything beyond pledging that the sheriff's department would enforce the ordinance, despite repeated attempts by county board members to get him to do so.\par \par \uc2 "When they wanted a more sweeping ordinance that would let everybody go free no matter what their criminal charge was, we just backed away from the conversation," Dart spokesman Steve Patterson said.\par \par \uc2 Judges can always order an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  -- or any other suspect -- held on bond so high that the person cannot pay. So most of the 280 people who have been the subject of federal detention requests aren't going anywhere. But a few will inevitably find enough money to get out.\par \par \uc2 That possibility, as well as the fact that some of those who have been released have failed to show up in court, all help explain why immigrant-rights activists, sheriffs and others are waiting to see if the board's actions backfire.\par \par \uc2 "I think everybody is watching to see how it plays out politically," said Arturo Venegas Jr., a former police chief in Sacramento, Calif., and immigration consultant who until recently served on a federal panel that was reviewing government efforts to find illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 In California's Santa Clara County, officials were almost ready to adopt a similar ordinance when, only an hour before their meeting, they got word that Cook County had tried it first. They decided to wait.\par \par \uc2 Whether the Cook County ordinance triggers the adoption of similar laws remains to be seen.\par \par \uc2 Already, the Obama administration has taken steps to relax the controversial program. Just this month, it announced that agents had rounded up nearly 3,000 criminals for deportation, stressing that all of those captured had at least one criminal conviction and half had a felony conviction. Eighty-seven of those arrested were from Illinois.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, at least one other jurisdiction that tried a law similar to Cook County's has reversed course in the interest of public safety. New Mexico's San Miguel County once drastically limited the detainment requests it would accept. Now it honors every single one.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020111004e7a4002ot\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) - When Rhode Island became the 13th state to allow in-state tuition for illegal immigrants at public colleges, supporters heralded the move as one that would give students the kind of advanced education they need to succeed in the workforce.\par \par \uc2 But students who are not here legally may still face a major obstacle even with the benefit of a college degree: Many have no immediate pathway to legal status and, under current federal immigration law, employers cannot legally hire them.\par \par \uc2 "I know of students who have graduated magna cum laude and top honors in their colleges, but right now they're working minimum wage in restaurants," said Antonio Albizures-Lopez, 20, who came to the U.S. from Guatemala when he was 1.\par \par \uc2 Albizures-Lopez, who is pursuing legal residency, says the best solution is passage of federal legislation, known as the DREAM Act, which provides a pathway to legal residency for college students.\par \par \uc2 The Rhode Island Board of Governors for Higher Education, which oversees the state's three public higher education institutions, unanimously approved in-state tuition for illegal immigrants last week, effective in the fall of 2012. The General Assembly had failed repeatedly to take action on legislation that's been introduced year after year.\par \par \uc2 Eleven states -- California, Connecticut, Illinois, Kansas, Maryland, Nebraska, New Mexico, New York, Texas, Utah and Washington -- have laws allowing the children of illegal immigrants to receive in-state rates if they meet certain requirements, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Oklahoma allows in-state tuition for the children of illegal immigrants under a state Board of Regents policy.\par \par \uc2 Gov. Lincoln Chafee, in urging the Board of Governors to adopt the change, said it would allow more Rhode Islanders to attend college, help build a stronger workforce and boost an economy that is among the nation's most troubled.\par \par \uc2 Research varies on how much resident tuition rates for illegal immigrants increase enrollment. A 2010 paper co-written by Aimee Chinn, an economist at the University of Houston, did not find a sizable increase overall for 18- to -24-year-olds in the 10 states studied, though it did find that Mexican men in their 20s attended at modestly higher rates. It also found that even in-state tuition may still be too expensive, especially since \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students do not qualify for federal education aid.\par \par \uc2 By contrast, a study this year by the Latino Policy Institute at Roger Williams University in Rhode Island, which looked at an array of research on the issue, said that in-state tuition has led to an enrollment increase among illegal immigrants, on average, of 31 percent in the places it has been implemented.\par \par \uc2 The Urban Institute has estimated that 65,000 illegal immigrants graduate from high school in the U.S. every year.\par \par \uc2 But even if more students go on to attend public colleges and universities with the benefit of in-state rates, a big question remains: How will they fare in the workforce after they graduate, even with a degree that traditionally makes it easier to get the kind of high-skill, high-paying job not available to those who finish only high school?\par \par \uc2 "Even with a college degree, there hasn't been a more general immigration reform that would enable these kids to get a job once they have their degree," said Chinn.\par \par \uc2 Amanda Pereira, 18, came to the U.S. illegally at the age of 6 from Brazil with her family.\par \par \uc2 "In a way, it is going to be another dead end," she said. "But in a way it is a help because at least they got through another four years and got their education, so they can find ways to possibly get legalized through an employer."\par \par \uc2 The Brandeis University freshman was granted legal status -- after more than a decade pursuing it -- last spring, but is continuing to advocate for \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students.\par \par \uc2 "We do need to continue pushing for the DREAM Act," she said.\par \par \uc2 That federal legislation -- the Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors Act -- would provide a pathway to legal residency for \uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2  students providing they meet certain requirements. A December study by UCLA estimated that such students could contribute anywhere from $1.4 trillion to $3.6 trillion to the nation's economy over the course of their careers, depending on how many ultimately obtain citizenship.\par \par \uc2 But the bill has failed to win the necessary votes on Capitol Hill despite repeated tries, and its prospects for passage are uncertain.\par \par \uc2 Albizures-Lopez, a resident of Lincoln who graduated from Blackstone Academy Charter School in 2009, called in-state tuition a "stepping stone" to college but added, "It's not complete. It's not even halfway complete."\par \par \uc2 He says he has "protected status" while his legal case for residency is pending, so he is able to work a part-time job coaching soccer at a private high school. He plans to apply to college, including the University of Rhode Island and Rhode Island College, where he could get in-state rates. URI's in-state tuition is $9,824, compared to $25,912 for out-of-state.\par \par \uc2 Terry Gorman, executive director of Rhode Islanders for Immigration Law Enforcement, opposes in-state tuition for illegal immigrants. He cites a 1996 federal law that laid out certain restrictions on \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  benefits, and says it's a violation of that statute to provide in-state tuition to students who came here illegally, on the basis of residence, if the same break is not available to all students -- including those from out of state.\par \par \uc2 Students paying out-of-state rates at California institutions mounted a legal challenge on those grounds, but the state Supreme Court upheld the in-state tuition policy, saying it did not conflict with federal law. The U.S. Supreme Court in June declined to hear the case.\par \par \uc2 But Gorman also maintains that the policy change offers students in the U.S. illegally a "false hope" about their post-graduation prospects.\par \par \uc2 "This is going to be an educated population that can't do anything with their education because they're illegal aliens," he said. "What do they do? They can't work."\par \par \uc2 Kimberly Mehlman-Orozco, who conducted the Latino Policy Institute study at Roger Williams, points out that, while that's the law, it isn't necessarily the reality. She said that under current enforcement practices, many who are here illegally are in fact being hired. That being the case, she said, they may as well be college-educated.\par \par \uc2 Under the new policy in Rhode Island, in-state rates will be available only to illegal immigrants' children who have attended a high school in the state for at least three years and graduated or received a GED. Students also must commit to seek legal status as soon as they are eligible, or lose their resident tuition.\par \par \uc2 Supporters of the policy change say it would affect approximately 140 students in Rhode Island.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020111002e7a2003oh\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) - An \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who pleaded guilty to murder has dropped his lawsuit against Alabama officials that claimed the legal defense he received at taxpayer expense was inadequate.\par \par \uc2 An attorney for Cenobio Sanchez filed a short document in federal court in Montgomery withdrawing the suit. The attorney, Stephen Etheredge of Dothan, gave no reason in the court papers and did not return phone calls seeking comment Friday.\par \par \uc2 Sanchez pleaded guilty in 2009 to the murder of his roommate in Houston County and to possessing a fake Social Security card and federal work permit. He received a 40-year sentence for the murder and a five-year sentence for the fake documents.\par \par \uc2 In Houston County, two attorneys are on contract to handle cases for each circuit judge where the defendants lack the money to hire lawyers.\par \par \uc2 Sanchez filed suit in August against state officials and Houston County officials, claiming the system in the southeast Alabama county for representing indigent defendants was inadequate. He said the court-appointed attorneys handled excessive caseloads and that caused him to plead guilty rather than taking his case to trial.\par \par \uc2 Tina Mikel, a legal resident who had pleaded guilty to a drug charge in Houston County, had joined Sanchez in the suit, but she also dropped out.\par \par \uc2 Their lawyer filed court papers to dismiss the suit after the governor and other defendants argued that it was improper. They said the two didn't have standing to sue because they had appealed their guilty pleas to the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals, and the court had rejected their appeals. The governor and other defendants also noted that Sanchez and Mikel wanted to block the continued use of the indigent defense system in Houston County, but that issue is no longer valid because the Legislature and governor enacted a law in June that is supposed to improve legal programs for indigent defendants.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110930e79u002ln\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) - The new co-chairman of a legislative panel on illegal immigration said Thursday he sees no pressing need in Oklahoma for more legislation on the issue, prompting outrage from some hardline proponents of a crackdown on illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 After four hours of testimony at a House interim study, state Rep. Charles Ortega said he heard no evidence supporting the need for broad immigration-related reforms.\par \par \uc2 "I keep hearing and have heard and continue to hear that because the cost is so monumental we need to really address this issue and impose these laws and penalties," said Ortega, R-Altus, the new co-chair of a joint House and Senate panel on illegal immigration. "But when you go to criminalizing people and you go to criminalizing businesses and you go to disrupting lives, I think we need to be careful where we tread in that area."\par \par \uc2 Ortega's comments drew immediate outrage from those who support harsher laws targeting illegal immigrants, including state Sen. Ralph Shortey, who represents a heavily Hispanic district in south Oklahoma City.\par \par \uc2 He said allowing Ortega to lead the immigration committee "is just like having Osama bin Laden as chairman of the Homeland Security Committee. You have a chairman who doesn't want to have meaningful immigration reform."\par \par \uc2 "Come to south Oklahoma City and you'll see that we have a very big need," Shortey said.\par \par \uc2 Shortey, who was elected last year after campaigning on the need to crack down on illegal immigration, sponsored bills to deny Oklahoma citizenship to babies born to illegal immigrants, make English the state's official language, and another, dubbed "Arizona-plus," that would allow police to confiscate property belonging to those in the country illegally, among other things. None of the bills cleared the Legislature.\par \par \uc2 Illegal immigration has been a tricky issue for Republicans because the push for a tougher crackdown has collided with another Republican priority -- creating a pro-business environment -- and business and industry leaders have quietly resisted attempts to add more restrictions on the hiring of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  workers.\par \par \uc2 Although more than a dozen anti-illegal immigration bills were introduced last session in the House, none of them became law. A leadership-backed bill that emerged last session that focused on human smuggling died in the House when Democrats who opposed it were joined by Republicans who maintained the bill didn't go far enough to crack down on employers who hire illegal workers.\par \par \uc2 State Rep. Randy Terrill, another harsh critic of illegal immigration, called the joint committee a "joke" and said its real purpose is to give House leaders political cover for doing little or nothing to target illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 "Rep. Ortega is doing exactly what the present chamber-owned Republican leadership appointed him to do, namely kill further attempts at real, meaningful immigration reform in Oklahoma," said Terrill, R-Moore. "This joint immigration committee is a joke, and it has been from the very beginning.\par \par \uc2 "It wasn't created to advance efforts to crack down on illegal immigration in Oklahoma, but to block them."\par \par \uc2 Terrill sponsored a sweeping anti-illegal immigration bill four years ago -- House Bill 1804 -- that has been the subject of a protracted legal battle in federal court.\par \par \uc2 Oklahoma's Hispanic population has increased dramatically in the last decade, and Hispanics have surpassed Native Americans as the largest minority group in the state, according to 2010 U.S. Census data. Hispanics made up 8.9 percent of the population in 2010, compared to 5.2 percent in 2000. The percentage of Hispanics living in Oklahoma trails the national average (16 percent) and some surrounding states like New Mexico, Texas, Colorado and Kansas.\par \par \uc2 An analysis of U.S. Census data on Oklahoma's non-citizen population, which includes illegal immigrants as well as legal non-citizens like students and temporary workers, shows an increase from 2.4 percent of the population in 2000 to nearly 4 percent in 2010.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110930e79u0002q\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 NEW YORK (AP) - The deportation letter arrived just as Nadia Habib was starting her junior year at Stony Brook University, its message straightforward and scary: Please report to our offices on Sept. 29, and be prepared to leave the country.\par \par \uc2 Habib, who moved to the U.S. from Bangladesh when she was a toddler, had known that she was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  since she was a teenager, her attorney says. But the knowledge that she would have to leave the country where she grew up -- the place she calls home -- was a horrible shock.\par \par \uc2 "It's a crazy situation to be in for someone like her," said her attorney, Aygul Charles. "To just kind of go through the motions and do the things that a normal college student would do, then have this letter sent to you that says `pack your bags.'"\par \par \uc2 Habib and her mother, Nazmin Habib, were granted a temporary reprieve Thursday as immigration officials postponed a final decision on their case, allowing them to stay in the U.S. for now. The two women arrived at a federal courthouse in lower Manhattan for their deportation meeting prepared to say goodbye to their family and board a plane. But instead, they emerged from the courthouse smiling as about 100 supporters cheered and chanted "education not deportation!"\par \par \uc2 "We still have a lot of waiting and hoping to do," Nadia Habib told supporters. "I'm just nervous. Tomorrow's my birthday, so this is kind of a great birthday present."\par \par \uc2 Immigration officials fingerprinted them, confiscated the Habibs' passports and put them under an order of supervision, which requires them to meet periodically with an immigration officer while their case is being reviewed. They weren't told when a decision would be made, though immigration officers said it was a high-priority case, Charles said.\par \par \uc2 Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, who has been working with immigration officials on behalf of the family, released a statement praising the decision not to deport them.\par \par \uc2 "I am thrilled that Nadia will be celebrating her 20th birthday tomorrow at home with her family and will be continuing her studies in the only country she's ever known," Gillibrand said.\par \par \uc2 The Habib family has taken a confusing legal path toward citizenship ever since they arrived in the U.S. in 1993 from Bangladesh with baby Nadia. Some details of the legal proceedings remain murky, as they have switched lawyers several times over the years. Charles was brought onto the case only a week ago, when Nadia Habib filled out an online form seeking help from the New York State Youth Leadership Council, an advocacy group that quickly took up her cause.\par \par \uc2 The problem began when Nazmin Habib became ill and missed a scheduled hearing in U.S. Immigration Court on April 26, 2000, according to a court document. The judge proceeded to conduct a hearing in absentia and denied her request for asylum based on past persecution in Bangladesh, Charles said.\par \par \uc2 When the Habibs tried to reopen the case by providing a doctor's note, the judge said the note was not credible because the doctor was not found in the court's registered list of physicians. Charles said this was a clerical error that was never corrected.\par \par \uc2 Nadia Habib's siblings were born in the U.S. and are thus citizens, while her father successfully applied for his green card based on his relationship with his children, Charles said.\par \par \uc2 "His attorney at the time told him that he shouldn't include his wife or Nadia in the application," Charles said. "I've been told by other attorneys that that's nonsense."\par \par \uc2 Many immigrant children like Nadia Habib don't learn that they are illegal until their teens, when they're applying for a driver's license or to college, Charles said.\par \par \uc2 The most famous example in recent memory was Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Jose Antonio Vargas, who discovered he was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  in high school after emigrating from the Philippines in 1993. Vargas lied about his immigration status to employers for years until he wrote about his struggles in a magazine story earlier this year. He lost his driver's license after the story was published, but has not been deported.\par \par \uc2 "This goes on throughout the country," Charles said. "There's so many kids in Nadia's shoes."\par \par \uc2 The family was not available for interviews on Thursday, and Charles was unable to provide the names of their prior attorneys. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesman Luis Martinez said the agency can't discuss the case without a privacy waiver.\par \par \uc2 Sara Martinez, 22, was among those who came out to support the family.\par \par \uc2 "The immigration system is broken and flawed," said Martinez, whose own family immigrated to the U.S. from Mexico when she was a baby.\par \par \uc2 Habib, who previously attended the prestigious Bronx High School of Science, told reporters that she would be returning to class Monday at the state university on Long Island.\par \par \uc2 "Obviously, it's a roller coaster. I'm just really grateful to be able to stay here longer," she said. "I'm just gonna continue doing what I've been doing, living my life as I have. And wait for an answer."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110929e79t001qs\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) - The police chief of a small town in the Appalachian foothills of Alabama didn't know what to do about checking the immigration status of a Hispanic man his department recently arrested on an old warrant. So he didn't do anything.\par \par \uc2 Alabama's strict new immigration law, which was largely upheld Wednesday by a federal judge, requires police to jail anyone who can't prove he or she is in the country legally.\par \par \uc2 Much of the law goes into effect immediately, but that doesn't mean there will be mass roundups of thousands of illegal immigrants anytime soon. Across Alabama, police charged with enforcing the nation's toughest law targeting illegal immigrants are trying to figure out how to enforce the law and pay for it.\par \par \uc2 The police chief, Chris West, and his three officers patrol Crossville, a rural town of 1,300 people that adjoins a Hispanic community of hundreds and maybe more. The nearest jail is 20 miles away. The law is complicated and they have little money for training.\par \par \uc2 "Right now we're waiting to find out what's in the law, and then we're going to start enforcing it," he said.\par \par \uc2 The law is described by both supporters and opponents as the toughest state law in the U.S. targeting illegal immigrants. U.S. District Judge Sharon Blackburn, a Republican appointee, wrote in a 115-page opinion Wednesday that some parts of the GOP-backed law conflict with federal statutes, but others don't. Left standing were several key elements that help make the Alabama law stricter than similar laws passed in Arizona, Utah, Indiana and Georgia.\par \par \uc2 Among other things, Alabama's law requires public school officials to check the immigration status of students, though they can still attend. Authorities can hold suspected illegal immigrants without bond and state courts are barred from enforcing contracts involving illegal immigrants. It's a misdemeanor for illegal immigrants to not have immigration papers.\par \par \uc2 Now police are trying to make sense of what their officers should do when they pull over Hispanic motorists or patrol communities that are home to the estimated 185,000 Hispanic people now in the state.\par \par \uc2 "We just need to know what to do without getting everyone in trouble," said Boaz Police Chief Terry Davis, president of an association of 365 Alabama police chiefs. "We're all sort of confused right now."\par \par \uc2 In Coffee County, where poultry plants and the annual tomato harvest are magnets for immigrants seeking work, Sheriff David Sutton said holding suspected illegal immigrants could cause overcrowding in his 124-bed jail, particularly because no one knows how long it might take federal officers to pick up people for possible deportation.\par \par \uc2 "We are going to enforce the law. But we are not going to seek out and search out. I don't have the manpower for that," he said.\par \par \uc2 In Birmingham's Jefferson County, which is trying to avoid filing the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history, Chief Deputy Randy Christian said deputies can't begin arresting suspected illegal immigrants until they get training, which the county can't afford.\par \par \uc2 "I am more concerned on where we will put the ones we detain," Christian wrote in an email. "We have a jail built for 900 inmates that is already overcrowded and averaging 1,200 inmates a day. It's another unfunded mandate to a county struggling to keep its head above water."\par \par \uc2 Bobby Timmons, executive director of the Alabama Sheriffs Association, said there are many questions yet to be answered, including who's responsible for the medical bills of detained illegal immigrants and what happens if federal agents don't pick up an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  promptly.\par \par \uc2 "If the federal people don't come and get him, how long do I hold him?" Timmons said.\par \par \uc2 "We ain't got no money. We are looking at the dollar factor," he said.\par \par \uc2 The governor said it will be up to the city or county jails to bear the costs of medical bills, and he is counting on federal authorities to assist Alabama in enforcing the new law.\par \par \uc2 "We expect the federal government to enforce the law that's there. We are almost forcing their hand to do that," Bentley said.\par \par \uc2 The law also could spell financial trouble for the state's agriculture industry, which relies on immigrant labor to harvest and process crops. Americans generally won't do the backbreaking work despite pay that usually is well above minimum wage.\par \par \uc2 Agriculture Commissioner John McMillan said his agency is trying to find a solution, but some crops may rot in the fields as workers leave the state rather than face arrest under the law.\par \par \uc2 "We have seen the enormous difficulties farmers, especially those in produce and poultry, have encountered as a result of the new immigration law," he said. "The economic hardship to farmers and agribusinesses will reverberate throughout Alabama's economy, as one-fifth of all jobs in our state come from farming."\par \par \uc2 North Alabama grower Jeremy Calvert of Bremen said he and other farmers would prefer hiring native Alabamians for field work, but it's just not possible. Calvert and other farmers have asked legislators to amend the law, possibly by carving out an exception for agriculture, but any changes are at least weeks away, and possibly much longer.\par \par \uc2 "It's a real shame that a working farmer has to break the law now just to make a living," he said.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press Writer Phillip Rawls and photographer Dave Martin contributed to this report from Montgomery.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110929e79t0014a\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

GOP sheriffs criticize gov on immigration\b0\par\par\uc2 By BOB SALSBERG   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 876 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 September 2011\par 17:05\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2011.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 BOSTON (AP) - Several Massachusetts sheriffs and U.S. Sen. Scott Brown said Wednesday that Gov. Deval Patrick's opposition to Secure Communities could push the state to the bottom of the list for implementation of the federal program aimed at identifying illegal immigrants who are arrested for crimes.\par \par \uc2 But federal immigration officials countered that the program, which is slated to be fully activated by the end of 2013, would be rolled out nationally according to a schedule that would not be influenced by the support -- or lack thereof -- from individual states or officials.\par \par \uc2 The issue has become increasingly contentious in Massachusetts, where critics of Patrick's position have pointed to several recent crimes allegedly committed by illegal immigrants and contended that the crimes may have been prevented had Secure Communities been in effect.\par \par \uc2 Three Massachusetts sheriffs, accompanied by several lawmakers, held a news conference at the Statehouse on Wednesday to announce that they would seek to immediately implement elements of the federal program in their counties. The news conference was cut short after a group of immigrant advocates holding signs denouncing Secure Communities entered the room where it was being held and some attempted to shout their own questions at the sheriffs.\par \par \uc2 Under the program, fingerprints taken from a crime suspect by local law enforcement officials would be turned over to the FBI, who would then share the information with the Department of Homeland Security. If it appeared that a person was in the U.S. illegally, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) could initiate deportation proceedings.\par \par \uc2 Critics say it could lead to profiling and increase tensions between police and immigrant communities.\par \par \uc2 Bristol County Sheriff Thomas Hodgson declared that Massachusetts was becoming a "magnet" for illegal immigrants who believe they will not be discovered in the state.\par \par \uc2 "We need to get Secure Communities faster than any other state," Hodgson said. "It's no secret that based on the kind of benefits that people are able to access here that, much like terrorists, they are looking for the place to go where no one will notice them."\par \par \uc2 Hodgson speculated that Massachusetts would be considered for speedier implementation of the program if Patrick were supportive of it.\par \par \uc2 "That would move us up the chain as far as Washington is concerned, if they heard from this governor. But if they're hearing that this governor doesn't want it, they are obviously going to the states that do want it first," said Hodgson, who was joined by two fellow Republicans, Worcester Sheriff Lewis Evangelidis and Joseph McDonald, sheriff of Plymouth County.\par \par \uc2 Brown, who did not attend the Statehouse event, on Wednesday released a letter to Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano, in which the Republican senator asked that Secure Communities be activated "swiftly and expeditiously" in Massachusetts.\par \par \uc2 Brown also expressed concern in his letter that Patrick's opposition would make Massachusetts a "low priority" for implementation by ICE.\par \par \uc2 But federal officials say arguments offered for or against the program won't impact the timing of its rollout.\par \par \uc2 "Because Secure Communities is fundamentally an information sharing program between two federal partners, the federal government makes the determination on when and where to activate it, based on the availability of federal resources," Ross Feinstein, a spokesman for ICE, said in an e-mailed statement.\par \par \uc2 Patrick, a Democrat, has made a similar argument, saying that Secure Communities is a federal program that the state cannot opt in to or opt out of. In June, however, he instructed his public safety secretary to send a letter to Homeland Security stating that Patrick wouldn't sign any memorandum of understanding for the state to join the program.\par \par \uc2 Patrick says police already turn fingerprints over to the FBI and he's expressed concern that the federal program would lead to profiling and create distrust between immigrants and law enforcement.\par \par \uc2 Activists who crashed the sheriffs' news conference on Wednesday agreed.\par \par \uc2 "Secure Communities is a program that is criminalizing people just because they don't have the proper documentation to live and work in the United States," said Patricia Montes, head of Centro Presente, a Latino immigrant rights organization.\par \par \uc2 The sheriffs declined to engage the protesters, saying the event was a news conference intended for reporters only. State police and park rangers arrived and asked the activists to leave the room, but they responded with the chant: "We have every right to speak."\par \par \uc2 The news conference was then abruptly ended.\par \par \uc2 Among the events that reignited the Secure Communities controversy in Massachusetts was the death in August of a 23-year-old motorcyclist in Milford. Authorities said an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Ecuador, who was driving a pickup truck drunk and without a license, struck Matthew Denice, dragged his body a quarter of a mile and then backed up over him.\par \par \uc2 On Monday, a Brazilian native who officials said may be in the U.S. illegally was arrested and charged with the fatal stabbing of his ex-girlfriend in Marshfield.\par \par \uc2 A bipartisan group of state lawmakers has unveiled a bill that among other things would crack down on illegal immigrants caught driving without a license and make it more difficult for them to live in public housing.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110928e79s0021t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

Scott Brown is urging federal officials to fully activate a program to check the immigration status of those arrested in Massachusetts despite the opposition of Gov. Deval Patrick.\par \par \uc2 In June, Patrick indicated he wouldn't sign any agreement for Massachusetts to participate in the Secure Communities program, saying he was worried about ethnic profiling.\par \par \uc2 In a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, Brown pointed to three recent deaths linked to illegal immigrants that he said might have been avoided if Massachusetts was fully participating in the program.\par \par \uc2 Local law enforcement agencies routinely send fingerprints to the FBI for criminal background checks when an individual is arrested. Under Secure Communities, the FBI shares the fingerprints with Homeland Security to look for potentially deportable immigrants.\par \par \uc2 ICE plans to achieve nationwide coverage in 2013.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110928e79s00219\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

CALDWELL   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 716 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 September 2011\par 16:07\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2011.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) - After months of complaints from immigrant advocates, the Obama administration promised in August that immigration authorities would start focusing their scarce resources on finding and deporting serious criminals, and largely leave alone immigrants whose only offense was crossing the border illegally.\par \par \uc2 To prove the point, more than 1,900 Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials spent the last week arresting nearly 3,000 criminal illegal immigrants in a nationwide sweep.\par \par \uc2 Everyone arrested had at least one criminal conviction and more than half were convicted of at least one felony, including attempted murder, rape and kidnapping. They will now face deportation.\par \par \uc2 ICE Director John Morton said Wednesday the roundup was the largest ICE effort to hunt down criminal illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 "This is what we should be doing; this is good law enforcement," Morton said. "It makes sense to be removing people who are committing crimes who are here illegally first and foremost."\par \par \uc2 There are still an estimated 1 million criminal illegal immigrants in the country, Morton said.\par \par \uc2 ICE has been widely criticized in recent months for using fingerprints collected in local jails to identify illegal immigrants. Many of the people identified through the Secure Communities program have not been convicted of a crime, only charged, and have been arrested for traffic violations or other misdemeanors.\par \par \uc2 In an Aug. 18 letter to a group of senators who have pushed for immigration reform, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said officials from DHS and the Justice Department would review approximately 300,000 deportation cases pending in federal immigration court.\par \par \uc2 At the time, officials said most non-criminals and those who do not pose a threat to public safety or national security would likely have their cases put on hold indefinitely. Those people would be allowed to stay in the country and apply for a work permit.\par \par \uc2 Critics have argued that the decision to delay some deportation cases amounts to amnesty for thousands of illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Morton said Wednesday the review has not started.\par \par \uc2 But agents in the field have been instructed to use discretion in evaluating who should be arrested and put in the system for deportation. In a June memo, Morton said discretion could be used in a variety of cases, including for people with no criminal record and young people brought to the United States illegally as children.\par \par \uc2 And some ICE offices and immigration judges around the country have already put a hold on a handful of cases.\par \par \uc2 In Maryland, Florinda Lorenzo, a 28-year-old \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Guatemala, was set to be deported in August after being arrested on a charge that she illegally sold a phone card to an undercover police officer, a misdemeanor. She served 16 hours of community service. In July she was given a reprieve and told she would have another year before she may finally have to leave the country.\par \par \uc2 Zorayda Moreira-Smith, a lawyer for Casa de Maryland, an advocacy group that has provided legal help to Lorenzo and others, said some of the center's clients have benefited from the new discretion policy. But others are still facing imminent deportation.\par \par \uc2 "It's really frustrating on our end," Moreira-Smith said of pending cases.\par \par \uc2 And Wednesday's announcement does little to clear up confusion over how many of her clients may eventually be able to stay, she said\par \par \uc2 "Because they came out with a press release, or press conference, that doesn't say anything about (other immigrants) who don't have a criminal record," Moreira-Smith said. "It doesn't resolve anything."\par \par \uc2 Morton said Wednesday while ICE officials are focusing on finding and deporting criminals some non-criminals may still face deportation because ICE has not suspended enforcement operations for everyone else.\par \par \uc2 "We don't have the power and are not going to suspend enforcement for an entire class of individuals in a broad way," Morton said.\par \par \uc2 A task force charged with reviewing Secure Communities has recommended that ICE use it only to identify serious criminals. Morton said he will meet with the task force before deciding if any changes should be made to the controversial program.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Alicia A.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) - A federal judge refused Wednesday to block key parts of a closely watched Alabama law that is considered the strictest state effort to clamp down on illegal immigration, including a measure that requires immigration checks of public school students.\par \par \uc2 U.S. District Judge Sharon Blackburn wrote in a 115-page opinion finding some parts of the law that conflict with federal statutes, but others that don't. Left standing at least temporarily are several key elements that help make the Alabama law stricter than similar laws passed in Arizona, Utah, Indiana and Georgia. Other federal judges already have blocked all or parts of those.\par \par \uc2 Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley said most of the law was still intact and the state will enforce it. He planned to work with the state attorney general's office to appeal those parts that the judge blocked. The judge's previous order blocking the entire law expires Thursday.\par \par \uc2 "With those parts that were upheld, we have the strongest immigration law in the country," he said. "I believe that all sections of our law will be upheld."\par \par \uc2 There are three separate lawsuits against the Alabama law, including the main challenge from President Barack Obama's administration. In all, Blackburn's orders temporarily blocked several parts of the law until she can issue a final ruling. Those measures would:\par \par \uc2 -- Make it a crime for an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  to solicit work.\par \par \uc2 -- Make it a crime to transport or harbor an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 -- Allow discrimination lawsuits against companies that dismiss legal workers while hiring illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 -- Forbid businesses from taking tax deductions for wages paid to workers who are in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 -- Bar illegal immigrants from attending public colleges.\par \par \uc2 -- Bar drivers from stopping along a road to hire temporary workers.\par \par \uc2 -- Make federal verification the only way in court to determine if someone is here legally.\par \par \uc2 The judge could still allow any or allow of those sections to take effect after further litigation.\par \par \uc2 Blackburn, who was appointed by Republican President George H.W. Bush, heard arguments from opponents including the Obama administration, immigrant-support groups and civil libertarians before it was supposed to take effect Sept. 1. The Justice Department contended the state law encroaches on the federal government's duty to enforce immigration law, and other opponents argued it violated basic rights to free speech and travel.\par \par \uc2 The judge Blackburn said federal law doesn't prohibit checking students or suspects pulled over by police. She also refused to stop provisions that allow police to hold suspected illegal immigrants without bond; bar state courts from enforcing contracts involving illegal immigrants; make it a felony for an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  to do business with the state for basic things like obtaining drivers licenses; and make it a misdemeanor for an illegal resident not to have immigration papers.\par \par \uc2 Immigration became a hot issue in Alabama over the last decade as the state's Hispanic population grew by 145 percent to about 185,600. While the group still represents only about 4 percent of the population, some counties in north Alabama have large Spanish-speaking communities and schools where most of the students are Hispanic.\par \par \uc2 Alabama Republicans have long sought to clamp down on illegal immigration and passed the law earlier this year after gaining control of the Legislature for the first time since Reconstruction. Bentley signed it, saying it was vital to protect jobs of legal residents.\par \par \uc2 Agricultural leaders fear those parts of the law could cost farmers money this autumn by scaring away Hispanic workers who are vital to harvesting crops statewide.\par \par \uc2 "There are some sweet potato farmers in this state it's really going to hurt. I don't know how they're going to get their crops out," said Jeremy Calvert, a farmer in rural Bremen.\par \par \uc2 Zan Green, a tea party activist in metro Birmingham, said she was happy with the decision, saying citizens of foreign countries have benefitted for years through welfare, entitlements, education, medical care and child tax credits.\par \par \uc2 ""Judge Blackburn's ruling is the beginning of removing the enormous financial burden of illegal immigration from the backs of Alabama citizens," she said in a statement.\par \par \uc2 Both supporters and critics say it is the nation's toughest partly because of the section that would require public schools to verify the citizenship status of students and report statistics to the state. Illegal immigrants wouldn't be barred attending public schools, but opponents contend the law is designed to decrease enrollment by creating a climate of fear.\par \par \uc2 In a statement on behalf of 150 United Methodist pastors who signed a letter opposing the law, Revs. Matt Lacey and R.G. Lyons said church leaders were "pleased to see some of the harsh and far-reaching elements of the law have been struck down."\par \par \uc2 "We feel that many of these elements, written by members of the State House and Senate who campaign on Christianity, are not representative of the message of Christ who welcomed the stranger despite country of origin or status," they said.\par \par \uc2 ------ Associated Press Writer Phillip Rawls contributed to this report from Montgomery.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110928e79s001ld\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHOENIX (AP) - A Phoenix woman is fighting to get health care for her husband, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who was in the process of obtaining legal status before he suffered brain damage while playing soccer.\par \par \uc2 Evelyn Saenz-Cornelio, 23, told The Associated Press on Tuesday that her husband, Jesus Armando Cornelio of Mexico, collapsed Sept. 19 while playing soccer at a park with his 13-year-old brother.\par \par \uc2 Saenz-Cornelio, who was born in Mexico but was raised in Phoenix and is now a U.S. citizen, said that doctors at Banner Good Samaritan Medical Center told her that her husband's brain was without oxygen for about 13 minutes after he collapsed, causing severe brain damage.\par \par \uc2 She said Cornelio, a 23-year-old construction worker, had obtained an employment authorization card and a Social Security card from the U.S. government and had an appointment this week for a final interview to get a permanent resident card.\par \par \uc2 She said the hospital told her Friday that Corelio's health care bill was at $120,000 so far and that Arizona's Medicaid program wouldn't cover his health care costs, telling her that she would either have to take him to Mexico for treatment or put him in hospice care, which could mean death.\par \par \uc2 But Saenz-Cornelio said the hospital gave her husband a one-week extension Tuesday. After that, she said she isn't sure what she's going to do.\par \par \uc2 Spokespeople at Banner Good Samaritan released a statement saying that its staff is focused on Cornelio's care and could not comment further to protect Cornelio's privacy.\par \par \uc2 Monica Coury, a spokeswoman at Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System, Arizona's Medicaid program, said federal law prohibits illegal immigrants from health care coverage. Even if Cornelio had obtained the permanent resident card he was seeking, an immigrant must be a legal permanent resident for five years to be covered, she said.\par \par \uc2 "They're federal rules, it's not a state issue," Coury said. "All this individual has is employment authorization and a Social Security number. That doesn't meet the requirement."\par \par \uc2 Saenz-Cornelio said doctors gave her little hope last week that her husband could recover but that over the weekend he made astonishing strides, including opening his eyes, squeezing family members' hands, yawning and coughing -- all things he hadn't done since Sept. 19.\par \par \uc2 She said although Cornelio has not spoken, he is recognizing people in the room and responding to some of their prompting.\par \par \uc2 "I have to learn to be strong, and right now that's what I keep in my head: `He wants you to be strong, to stay positive,'" she said. "I have to have faith that little by little, he's going to get better and show the doctors and nurses that he wants to be here."\par \par \uc2 She said Cornelio came to Phoenix when he was 10 years old in 1998, and that the two first met in the sixth grade. They began dating at 16 and were high school sweethearts.\par \par \uc2 They married at 22 and were trying to have children and get Cornelio legal status in the U.S. when he collapsed playing soccer.\par \par \uc2 She said Cornelio has played soccer all his life and had initially qualified for a scholarship to attend Phoenix College. But it turned out that he was ineligible because of a 2006 voter-approved Arizona law that says illegal immigrants can't get in-state tuition or financial aid funded by state coffers.\par \par \uc2 Saenz-Cornelio described Cornelio as always having a positive attitude and being incredibly responsible.\par \par \uc2 "He was like an adult stuck in a teenage body ever since I met him -- his way of thinking, looking at life, his goals, his plans for himself and me," she said.\par \par \uc2 "He's my best friend, he's my husband," she added through tears. "He's my everything."\par \par \uc2 Lydia Guzman, an immigrant-rights advocate, said Cornelio's story shows the importance of solving some of the nation's toughest issues, including immigration and health care.\par \par \uc2 "This young man is stuck in the middle of all this turmoil," she said.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Follow Amanda Lee Myers on Twitter at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://twitter.com/#!/AmandaLeeAP"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://twitter.com/#!/AmandaLeeAP}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110927e79r002vz\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 AUSTIN, Texas (AP) - U.S. Senate candidate David Dewhurst broke with Gov. Rick Perry this week by opposing in-state college tuition rates for children of illegal immigrants, a stance that prompted sharp criticism Tuesday from opponents who say the Republican lieutenant governor has been soft on the issue.\par \par \uc2 Dewhurst said he questioned the fairness of the 10-year-old Texas law.\par \par \uc2 "If we're not going to give fellow Americans who live in Louisiana or Oklahoma or New Mexico the ability to come into Texas and have in-state tuition and save, then is it fair to give that break to people who are not citizens here?" Dewhurst said in a taping for a political show to be aired Sunday on Dallas' WFAA-TV. "So, I would not have signed that law."\par \par \uc2 Perry, seeking the Republican presidential nomination, has held strong to his support of a 2001 law that Texas universities allow the children of illegal immigrants to pay discounted in-state tuition rates. He's been criticized by opponents in his own party for his position, but has pushed back hard against his rivals.\par \par \uc2 He argues that the students should be educated and not punished for the actions of their parents. To qualify for the reduced rate, children of illegal immigrants must have graduated from a Texas high school and have attended a Texas school for at least three years. The law also requires noncitizens to promise to apply for citizenship.\par \par \uc2 At a Republican debate last week, Perry said people who don't support education benefits for the children of illegal immigrants are heartless.\par \par \uc2 The legislation became law before Dewhurst became lieutenant governor in 2003. Since then, several legislative efforts to ban the practice have failed. Dewhurst's political rivals blamed him for not doing more to repeal the law as leader of the Texas Senate.\par \par \uc2 The Republican field to fill the seat of retiring Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, includes Texas solicitor general Ted Cruz and former Dallas Mayor Tom Leppert, who both said they also oppose giving in-state tuition rates to children of illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 "This is another Republican primary-year conversion by David Dewhurst," Cruz said. "He was for in-state tuition for illegal immigrants before he was against it.\par \par \uc2 "The next senator from Texas needs to be a strong conservative who knows what he believes. I strongly oppose in-state tuition for illegal aliens, and categorically oppose amnesty or preferential treatment for illegal immigrants."\par \par \uc2 Leppert called Dewhurst a career politician "failing to act when offered numerous opportunities to do so."\par \par \uc2 A spokesman for Dewhurst's Senate campaign defended his legislative record.\par \par \uc2 "The overwhelming majority of the Senate favored the in-state tuition benefit, and Governor Perry has been firm in his support of the law," Dewhurst campaign spokesman Matt Hirsch said. "In light of Governor Perry's veto pen, it was clear that any attempt to repeal this benefit would not be signed into law. David focused instead on strengthening border security by devoting hundreds of millions toward enforcement, toughening laws against human trafficking and reducing voter fraud."\par \par \uc2 The campaign declined to make him available for an interview with the AP.\par \par \uc2 Texas Railroad Commission chairwoman Elizabeth Ames Jones, also seeking the GOP nomination, supported the measure as a member of the Texas House when it was adopted. She voted in favor of granting in-state tuition rates to immigrant children.\par \par \uc2 "She agreed with a near unanimous Legislature that innocent young people should not be punished for graduating high school and being accepted to college," campaign spokesman Patrick Isenberg said. "But again, (she) believes this is an issue for the Texas Legislature, not the federal government."\par \par \uc2 More than 16,000 children of illegal immigrants -- less than 1 percent of all students enrolled in Texas colleges and universities -- received the reduced rate last year, according to the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board. Most of them attended community colleges, agency spokesman Dominic Chavez said.\par \par \uc2 Average savings range from almost $10,000 per academic year at four-year universities to less than $3,000 per year at community colleges.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110927e79r001xx\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WARWICK, R.I. (AP) - A state higher education board on Monday approved a measure that would allow students who immigrated to the United States illegally to pay in-state tuition rates at Rhode Island's public colleges and universities after the General Assembly declined to take up the issue.\par \par \uc2 The Board of Governors for Higher Education heard hours of public testimony on the policy change from dozens of speakers at a meeting that at times featured cheers, boos and heckling from opponents and supporters -- both of whom said their position was the fairer one.\par \par \uc2 The board, 11 of whose 13 members were present, voted unanimously for the measure at the end of the meeting at the Community College of Rhode Island's Warwick campus.\par \par \uc2 Board member Eva Mancuso, chairwoman of the committee that gave the preliminary green light to the policy change, said just before the vote that the issue had been studied extensively. She called in-state tuition for illegal immigrants "fair" and "logical."\par \par \uc2 Under the new policy, in-state rates will be available only to illegal immigrants' children who have attended a high school in the state for at least three years and graduated or received an equivalent degree. They also have to commit to seek legal status as soon as they are eligible; they will lose the resident tuition if they do not, under an amendment adopted Monday night. The new policy takes effect in 2012.\par \par \uc2 Currently, in-state undergraduate tuition at the University of Rhode Island is $9,824, compared to $25,912 for out-of-state students. The state has two other public higher education institutions: the Community College of Rhode Island and Rhode Island College.\par \par \uc2 The General Assembly did not act on a bill this year that would have granted the children of illegal immigrants in-state tuition -- legislation that has been introduced every year for years.\par \par \uc2 Gov. Lincoln Chafee threw his support behind the board measure Sunday, saying it would improve the state's "intellectual and cultural life" and allow more Rhode Islanders to attend college. In addition, those developments would make for a stronger work force and would boost the state's flagging economy, he said.\par \par \uc2 "All that separates these young people from the thousands of other students who gain entry to Rhode Island's public colleges and universities each year is the place where they were born -- a factor none of us can control," Chafee, an independent, said in a statement.\par \par \uc2 Several speakers Monday raised objections to the board taking any action at all, with some calling the meeting a sham and saying its unelected members would be circumventing the legislature if they changed the policy. No other state that has approved in-state tuition for illegal immigrants did so outside a legislative act.\par \par \uc2 "You have no business doing this. Period," state Rep. Doreen Costa, R-North Kingstown, told the board.\par \par \uc2 Delores Issler of the group Ocean State Tea Party in Action spoke against the policy change, saying her daughter, a citizen, has been unemployed since February and is struggling with an in-state tuition hike. It would be "unconscionable" to take "one thin dime and use it for anyone other than an American citizen," she said.\par \par \uc2 Other opponents said offering in-state tuition to illegal immigrants would reward illegal behavior.\par \par \uc2 Terry Gorman, executive director of Rhode Islanders for Immigration Law Enforcement, who testified before the board, said before the meeting that the policy change would be akin to "aiding and abetting" illegal immigrants. He called it unfair to students paying higher out-of-state rates.\par \par \uc2 "I've met a lot of these students," Gorman said. "My heart goes out to them, but their parents put them in this situation."\par \par \uc2 According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 12 states, including Connecticut, have laws allowing the children of illegal immigrants to receive in-state rates if they meet certain requirements. Several states have also passed legislation barring in-state benefits for illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 A federal bill known as the DREAM Act that would allow \uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2  students to remain in the country legally has repeatedly fallen short of the votes needed to pass Congress. Students would be granted legal status providing they were under the age of 16 when they entered the U.S., have been in the country at least five years and have graduated from high school.\par \par \uc2 At the start of Monday's meeting, supporters unfurled a banner declaring: "Our Dreams Can't Wait. We Want to Pay Tuition." Among those who spoke in favor of the policy change was Amanda Pereira, a freshman at Brandeis University in Massachusetts and a graduate of Classical High School in Providence.\par \par \uc2 Pereira, who has testified repeatedly at the Statehouse in favor of the Rhode Island bill, urged the board to adopt the new policy. She came with her family to the U.S. from Brazil when she was 6.\par \par \uc2 Now 18, she was granted permanent residency last spring along with her parents and brother -- a process she says took over a decade. But she has kept up the fight, saying she could have hit an educational dead end herself if her green card hadn't come through.\par \par \uc2 "Basically, it's just a matter of equality. The students that have been here and have worked hard deserve the same educational opportunities as those who were born here," she told The Associated Press before the meeting.\par \par \uc2 5\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110927e79r0005p\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) - A state higher education board is planning to vote on a measure that would allow students who immigrated to the United States illegally to pay in-state tuition rates at Rhode Island's public colleges and universities after the General Assembly declined to take up the issue.\par \par \uc2 The 13-member Board of Governors for Higher Education planned to hear public testimony on the policy change ahead of a vote Monday evening at the Community College of Rhode Island's Warwick campus.\par \par \uc2 Gov. Lincoln Chafee threw his support behind the measure Sunday, saying it would improve the state's "intellectual and cultural life" and allow more Rhode Islanders to attend college. In addition, those developments would make for a stronger work force and would boost the state's flagging economy, he said.\par \par \uc2 "All that separates these young people from the thousands of other students who gain entry to Rhode Island's public colleges and universities each year is the place where they were born -- a factor none of us can control," Chafee, an independent, said in a statement.\par \par \uc2 In-state rates would be available only to illegal immigrants' children who have attended a high school in the state for at least three years and graduated or received an equivalent degree. They also would have to commit to seek legal status as soon as they are eligible.\par \par \uc2 Currently, in-state undergraduate tuition at the University of Rhode Island is $9,824, compared to $25,912 for out-of-state students. The state has two other public higher education institutions: the Community College of Rhode Island and Rhode Island College.\par \par \uc2 The General Assembly did not act on a bill this year that would have granted the children of illegal immigrants in-state tuition -- legislation that has been introduced every year for over a decade.\par \par \uc2 Groups demanding stricter enforcement of immigration laws oppose tuition breaks that they say are an incentive to illegally enter the United States. Terry Gorman, executive director of Rhode Islanders for Immigration Law Enforcement, says the change is akin to "aiding and abetting" illegal immigrants and is unfair to students paying higher out-of-state rates.\par \par \uc2 Gorman, who has repeatedly testified at the Statehouse against the change, calls in-state tuition "an invitation" for more illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 "I've met a lot of these students," Gorman said Monday afternoon before the vote. "My heart goes out to them, but their parents put them in this situation."\par \par \uc2 His group has also called the board's planned vote "undemocratic," saying a policy change of this sort should be taken up by the legislature, not an unelected board.\par \par \uc2 "This is a back-door circumvention of the legislative process," he said.\par \par \uc2 According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 12 states -- including Connecticut -- have laws allowing the children of illegal immigrants to receive in-state rates if they meet certain requirements. Several states have also passed legislation barring in-state benefits for illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 A federal bill known as the DREAM Act that would allow \uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2  students to remain in the country legally has repeatedly fallen short of the votes needed to pass Congress. Students would be granted legal status providing they were under the age of 16 when they entered the U.S., have been in the country at least five years and have graduated from high school.\par \par \uc2 Amanda Pereira, a freshman at Brandeis University in Massachusetts and a graduate of Classical High School in Providence, has testified repeatedly in favor of the Rhode Island bill and spent time lobbying legislators. She came with her family to the U.S. from Brazil when she was 6 and says "this is the country that I know as my home."\par \par \uc2 Pereira, 18, was granted permanent residency last spring along with her parents and brother -- a process she says took over a decade. But she has kept up the fight, saying she could have hit an educational dead end herself if her green card hadn't come through.\par \par \uc2 "Basically, it's just a matter of equality. The students that have been here and have worked hard deserve the same educational opportunities as those who were born here," she said.\par \par \uc2 State Rep. Edith Ajello, a Providence Democrat who has co-sponsored the Rhode Island legislation, sees the issue not just in educational terms but economic ones.\par \par \uc2 "The more people that we can educate to 21st century standards, the better our economy will be," she said Monday. "These young people are invested in Rhode island. They've been educated here in our elementary and secondary schools. They want to stay here."\par \par \uc2 She said the students' families are already contributing to the state's economic base by paying sales and other taxes.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110926e79q001md\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) - \uc2 Meg Whitman\uc2  may be best known as the billionaire Republican who spent nearly $175 million on a failed effort to become California governor, offering little insight into her motivation in the process.\par \par \uc2 To the business world, she's the former CEO star of \uc2 eBay\uc2 , the online auction site she took to its height during the dot-com boom but left amid slowing growth and her unsuccessful gamble to buy the Skype Internet phone service for $2.6 billion.\par \par \uc2 After November's loss to Democrat Jerry Brown in the governor's race, Whitman has been re-engaging with her business colleagues and trying to repair her public image by joining several high-profile boards and donating money to education reform. She joined the board of directors of \uc2 Hewlett-Packard Co\uc2 . in January as part of the most recent shake-up at the troubled technology company.\par \par \uc2 On Thursday, she was named its new chief executive as the board ousted Leo Apotheker after just 11 months on the job -- the third CEO bounced from HP in the last six years. The company's market value has fallen by $60 billion and has been adjusting its earnings downward.\par \par \uc2 Whitman, 55, provided what she called the "adult supervision" as the fledgling auction site \uc2 eBay\uc2  grew from a website with 30 employees to a corporation with 15,000 people and nearly $6 billion in revenue.\par \par \uc2 She has only one other stint as chief executive on her resume, at the flower delivery company FTD in the mid-1990s, where her turnaround attempt failed. Whitman says she fell short and conceded defeat amid unrealistic expectations.\par \par \uc2 When she arrived at the flower company's Detroit headquarters in 1995, Whitman said she found frustrated employees and a lackluster business plan. Her detached managing style did little to boost morale, former employees said, and ultimately, she left after serving less than two years of her five-year contract.\par \par \uc2 She told investors the company couldn't be fixed, "at least not by me," according to her 2010 biography "The Power of Many."\par \par \uc2 Whitman had been brought in by former colleagues at the investment firm \uc2 Bain Capital\uc2 , where she began her business career under the tutelage of former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, now one of the top Republican presidential hopefuls. She was asked to help FTD transition from a member-owned nonprofit cooperative association to a profitable corporation.\par \par \uc2 Whitman was not immediately available for interviews Thursday, HP spokesman Michael Thacker said.\par \par \uc2 Her political consultant, Jeff Randle, said Whitman is uniquely qualified to take over at HP because she has a deep understanding of the way Silicon Valley works and believes the company is critical to the state.\par \par \uc2 "The goal is to turn this around and make HP work, make it a successful company," he said. "Based on \uc2 Meg Whitman\uc2 's resume and her service on the board, she was a logical choice."\par \par \uc2 Politics was an odd fit for Whitman, who ascended through corporate America after earning an economics degree from Princeton and an MBA from Harvard. She started at \uc2 Bain & Co\uc2 . and worked her way up to blue-chip companies that included \uc2 Disney\uc2  and Stride-Rite shoes.\par \par \uc2 She resigned from the board of \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2  in 2002 amid a scandal over the now-illegal practice of "spinning," in which she and other well-heeled clients got first dibs at initial public stock offerings, then sold them quickly for large profits, which for Whitman amounted to $1.8 million.\par \par \uc2 Her discomfort in the political spotlight stood out during last year's gubernatorial campaign as the mother of two adult sons traversed the state. She was criticized for revealing little of herself and has since acknowledged it was a tactical mistake borne of her misunderstanding of the differences between business and political leadership styles.\par \par \uc2 Whitman's fate as a candidate was sealed when, after spending millions of dollars on the most intensive Republican Hispanic outreach program in California history, her former housekeeper emerged in the final weeks of the race to say Whitman fired her after nine years when she revealed she was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 It later came to light that the maid had help from union groups who supported Brown for governor.\par \par \uc2 As an adviser to 2008 presidential nominee John McCain, Whitman said she would support legalization for immigrants who pay a fine and learn English, but she was forced to take a much harder line during her Republican gubernatorial primary.\par \par \uc2 Before joining her former boss turned political mentor, Romney, during the 2008 Republican presidential primary, Whitman had shown little interest in politics and had rarely even voted. The educational foundation named for Whitman and her husband, Stanford neurosurgeon Dr. Griffith Harsh IV, was mostly inactive. She had had little community involvement.\par \par \uc2 Despite spending $144 million of her own fortune in her bid for governor, Forbes still pegs Whitman's wealth at $1.3 billion.\par \par \uc2 Even while ascending to the top post at HP, Whitman's aspirations for a cabinet or White House post should Romney be elected have not dimmed. She has worked as a fundraiser for him this year and "would have to consider an offer from President Romney," said Randle, her political consultant.\par \par \uc2 But he added that would not have to be at the beginning of his term.\par \par \uc2 After months of public criticism during the race, Whitman has sought to rehabilitate her image in the last few months.\par \par \uc2 After signing on with the HP board, she became a strategic partner at venture capital firm \uc2 Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers\uc2  and joined the boards of \uc2 Procter & Gamble\uc2 , one of her former employers, and ZipCar, the rental firm that went public in April.\par \par \uc2 The Long Island native also has begun moving into a more public role as a philanthropist.\par \par \uc2 She appeared last week with Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, a prominent Democrat, to donate $500,000 for math education in the nation's second largest public school system.\par \par \uc2 This week, the Whitman-Harsh Family Foundation added a $2.5 million gift to Summit Public Schools for 10 new charter schools. Whitman, who is on the board of Summit, said the foundation would give up to $2.5 million more in matching funds from Silicon Valley donations.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writer Jordan Robertson in San Francisco contributed to this story.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110923e79n000yq\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - \uc2 Hewlett-Packard\uc2  has performed another extreme act of corporate remodeling, firing its CEO Leo Apotheker after just 11 months and replacing him with billionaire businesswoman and political aspirant \uc2 Meg Whitman\uc2 . Yet it's done little to convince investors that the company has its house in order.\par \par \uc2 HP has now removed two CEOs in two years, and the stock has dropped precipitously, shedding $60 billion of HP's market value. Based on shareholder reaction to Thursday's CEO shuffle, more punishment is likely in store.\par \par \uc2 Mark Hurd was forced to resign a year ago in an ethics scandal, and on Thursday HP fired his successor, Leo Apotheker, after a string of disappointing earnings reports and the botched handling of key strategy announcements.\par \par \uc2 He was replaced by former \uc2 eBay\uc2  chief \uc2 Meg Whitman\uc2 , who brings celebrity appeal and the sheen of a dot-com-era star who transformed \uc2 eBay Inc\uc2 . from scrappy startup to Internet-auction powerhouse.\par \par \uc2 The decision was the kind of hasty, headline-grabbing move that Silicon Valley watchers have come to expect from HP as it muddles through a very public identity crisis with an unpredictable board and the hardest job in technology to fill.\par \par \uc2 It was another dizzying turn of the executive merry-go-round at a company whose legendary leadership issues are straining HP's sprawling technology empire, which includes the world's biggest printer and PC businesses.\par \par \uc2 Shareholders were impressed by reports that leaked Wednesday about Whitman's candidacy for the job. But those gains were largely wiped out Thursday when fears set in that HP's strategy is still deeply flawed.\par \par \uc2 It's not what HP had in mind. Swapping Apotheker, who has now been ousted from two high-profile CEO jobs in two years, for Whitman was designed to stem investor fury over a series of questionable strategy moves.\par \par \uc2 HP's chairman, Ray Lane, said Apotheker's dismissal was caused by several factors.\par \par \uc2 "You don't deliver a quarter, you don't deliver another quarter, then you make some important announcements that are communicated poorly -- it was incremental," Lane said on a conference call. Whitman was on the call, but Apotheker was not. "Then you have to make the tough call of, how long do you go along with that? Do you help? Do you surround? Or do you replace?"\par \par \uc2 Whitman is a billionaire who is best known for the decade she spent building \uc2 eBay\uc2  and her unsuccessful run last year for California governor.\par \par \uc2 Her star power could be an asset for a company that struggled to gain credibility under Apotheker, who was previously little-known outside of the business-software world. HP is no stranger to celebrity CEOs. But Carly Fiorina's run at the company's helm, from 1999 to 2005, ended in shambles.\par \par \uc2 Despite Whitman's success at \uc2 eBay\uc2 , she is untested when it comes to running a company that is in as many businesses as HP. Another turnaround effort earlier in her career, at FTD, the iconic flower-delivery company, ended with Whitman quitting after two years and declaring that the company is "not fixable." Many analysts have said the same thing about HP in its current form.\par \par \uc2 On Thursday, she defended her predecessor's most controversial moves. She said a decision on PC division's fate will be made by the end of the year.\par \par \uc2 Analysts are mixed about her prospects.\par \par \uc2 "She built up a one-trick pony, an online auction site, and she oversaw the growth of the company, but we are talking about a situation where someone needs to come in who has a technological background, an engineering and scientific background," said Steve Diamond, an associate professor at Santa Clara University School of Law. "And that is way outside of her skill set."\par \par \uc2 Diamond said the decision to change CEOs so soon points to continued disarray on HP's board, long a target of critics for the chaos it's caused at one of Silicon Valley's oldest and largest companies. Infighting and ego-driven drama has long plagued the board, from revelations in 2006 that HP had spied on directors and journalists to ferret out the source of leaks, to last year's dismissal of CEO Mark Hurd in an ethics scandal.\par \par \uc2 "There's no question the board is off the rails -- they need a smaller, tighter board that's committed to the idea of what the company does," Diamond said. "But they have a lot of people on the board from different industries. The tough job will be getting the board on board."\par \par \uc2 Whitman's appointment Thursday was Silicon Valley's worst-kept secret. Deliberations leaked out a day earlier to the delight of investors, who drove up HP's stock and apparently gave HP's board the push it needed to oust Apotheker.\par \par \uc2 HP's board met Thursday to finalize the change, having decided that Apotheker had lost the board's confidence in his ability to lead HP long-term, a person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press. This person was not authorized to speak on behalf of HP and spoke on the condition of anonymity.\par \par \uc2 Lane, the HP chairman, defended Apotheker's firing and Whitman's quick selection.\par \par \uc2 The board "objectively evaluated whether he was the right guy to operate the business, and we came to the conclusion that he was not," he said on the conference call. "And we chose someone who is a great operator, who executed in her business for years and has a track record of leadership. I can't think of a name out there over Meg that I would pick to be CEO of this company."\par \par \uc2 Apotheker was also forced to resign from HP's board. Lane's position has been elevated. He was non-executive chairman. He is now executive chairman.\par \par \uc2 An HP spokesman said that Apotheker, Whitman and Lane were not immediately available for interviews.\par \par \uc2 Whitman's likely arrival was greeted warmly Wednesday, when investors drove the stock up more than 7 percent on reports she was being considered for the job. But most of those gains evaporated Thursday, when fears set in that the company's strategy is still in need of repair.\par \par \uc2 Cathie Lesjak\uc2 , HP's chief financial officer, added to those fears when she disclosed that she isn't sure HP can hit its revenue target of $32.1 billion to $32.5 billion in the quarter ending Oct. 31. She reaffirmed earnings guidance. She blamed weakness across consumer and commercial markets, particularly in Europe.\par \par \uc2 HP's stock fell $1.18, or 4.9 percent, to close at $22.80 on Thursday. It fell another 7 cents in after-hours trading. The declines were worse than the overall market. The Dow Jones industrial average plunged 391 points, or 3.5 percent, on worries that the global economy is headed for another recession.\par \par \uc2 Boosting HP's sagging stock price will be an urgent problem for Whitman.\par \par \uc2 HP's market value has dropped by $60 billion since CEO Mark Hurd was forced out in August of last year over an ethical scandal. Hurd's departure set the stage for Apotheker's appointment as CEO and Lane's appointment as chairman.\par \par \uc2 Proving she can instill order in a disordered company is another pressing issue.\par \par \uc2 EBay, when Whitman inherited it, was a star on the rise. HP is struggling with bloat and hasn't decided on a clear direction. It knows it wants to be more like \uc2 IBM Corp\uc2 ., but has a long way to go to complete the transformation.\par \par \uc2 Steering a startup through a period of growth is markedly different from running an established company that's fallen on hard times, experts say.\par \par \uc2 Whitman touted her business credentials on the campaign trail in her unsuccessful California gubernatorial bid. She spent more than any candidate for a statewide office in U.S. history on the campaign --at least $174 million, most of it her own money.\par \par \uc2 She became a respected executive for her work at \uc2 eBay\uc2 , transforming it from a website with a few dozen employees and less than $100 million in revenue into an industry heavyweight with thousands of workers and billions in sales.\par \par \uc2 But her record as CEO also includes a lesser-known episode that paints a different picture of her abilities to quell a company in disarray. Whitman's time at FTD in the 1990s was her most high-profile turnaround attempt. It did not end well.\par \par \uc2 Whitman has rarely spoken about her time at FTD. It's an imperfect comparison to HP, but Whitman was brought in to the company in 1995 by her former colleagues at investment firm \uc2 Bain & Co\uc2 . to spearhead a major transformation. She was supposed to stay five years, but ended up quitting after two, citing investors' unrealistic goals.\par \par \uc2 "This company is not fixable, at least not by me," Whitman wrote in her book, "The Power of Many." She calls her tenure there "probably the most frustrating and, ultimately, least successful executive experience of my career."\par \par \uc2 Other types of concerns have been raised about Whitman.\par \par \uc2 She was named to HP's board this year as part of a sweeping overhaul under Apotheker and Lane. They were supposed to be steadying hands. But almost immediately, corporate governance experts began crying foul. They took issue with the fact Whitman's hiring by esteemed venture capital firm \uc2 Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers\uc2 , where Lane works, was announced a week after she was formally elected to HP's board.\par \par \uc2 Several unflattering incidents helped scuttle her gubernatorial campaign.\par \par \uc2 She was revealed to have shoved an \uc2 eBay\uc2  employee during a disagreement, which led to a six-figure settlement. Whitman said the altercation was an anomaly and taught her to always be professional. It was also revealed that her former housekeeper of nine years was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 To complicate matters further, Whitman was a board member at \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2  when it allegedly engaged in the now-illegal practice called "spinning," in which wealthy clients and CEOs whose companies did business with Goldman received early access to IPO shares, which they flipped quickly for large profits. Whitman said she forfeited the $1.8 million she made from the deals in a lawsuit she settled with \uc2 eBay\uc2  shareholders.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writer Juliet Williams in Sacramento and AP Business Writer Chip Cutter in New York contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110923e79n000yo\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc54}{\*\bkmkend toc54}\b \uc2 Meg Whitman\uc2  brings celebrity appeal, mixed record to \uc2 Hewlett-Packard\uc2 's top job\b0\par\par\uc2 By JORDAN ROBERTSON   \par \uc2 AP Technology Writer\par \uc2 1,540 \uc2 words\par \uc2 22 September 2011\par 19:37\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2011.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - \uc2 Hewlett-Packard Co\uc2 .'s decision to fire CEO Leo Apotheker after just 11 months and replace him with former \uc2 eBay\uc2  chief \uc2 Meg Whitman\uc2  is another dizzying turn of the executive merry-go-round at a company whose leadership issues are straining a sprawling technology empire.\par \par \uc2 Swapping Apotheker, who has now been ousted from two high-profile CEO jobs in two years, for Whitman is a decision designed to stem investor fury over a series of questionable strategy moves.\par \par \uc2 Apotheker was doomed by disappointing earnings and his fumbled announcement that HP's personal computer division is for sale. HP's chairman, Ray Lane, said the dismissal was caused by several factors.\par \par \uc2 "You don't deliver a quarter, you don't deliver another quarter, then you make some important announcements that are communicated poorly -- it was incremental," Lane said on a conference call. Whitman was on the call, but Apotheker was not. "Then you have to make the tough call of, how long do you go along with that? Do you help? Do you surround? Or do you replace?"\par \par \uc2 Whitman is a billionaire who is best known for the decade she spent building \uc2 eBay\uc2  and her unsuccessful run last year for California governor.\par \par \uc2 Her star power could be an asset for a company that struggled to gain credibility under Apotheker, who was previously little-known outside of the business-software world. HP is no stranger to celebrity CEOs. But Carly Fiorina's run at the company's helm, from 1999 to 2005, ended in shambles.\par \par \uc2 Despite Whitman's success at \uc2 eBay\uc2 , she is untested when it comes to running a company that is in as many businesses as HP. Another turnaround effort earlier in her career, at FTD, the iconic flower-delivery company, ended with Whitman quitting after two years and declaring that the company is "not fixable." Many analysts have said the same thing about HP in its current form.\par \par \uc2 On Thursday, she defended her predecessor's most controversial moves. She said a decision on PC division's fate will be made by the end of the year.\par \par \uc2 Analysts are mixed about her prospects.\par \par \uc2 "She built up a one-trick pony, an online auction site, and she oversaw the growth of the company, but we are talking about a situation where someone needs to come in who has a technological background, an engineering and scientific background," said Steve Diamond, an associate professor at Santa Clara University School of Law. "And that is way outside of her skill set."\par \par \uc2 Diamond said the decision to change CEOs so soon points to continued disarray on HP's board, long a target of critics for the chaos it's caused at one of Silicon Valley's oldest and largest companies. Infighting and ego-driven drama has long plagued the board, from revelations in 2006 that HP had spied on directors and journalists to ferret out the source of leaks, to last year's dismissal of CEO Mark Hurd in an ethics scandal.\par \par \uc2 "There's no question the board is off the rails -- they need a smaller, tighter board that's committed to the idea of what the company does," Diamond said. "But they have a lot of people on the board from different industries. The tough job will be getting the board on board."\par \par \uc2 Whitman's appointment Thursday was Silicon Valley's worst-kept secret. Deliberations leaked out a day earlier to the delight of investors, who drove up HP's stock and apparently gave HP's board the push it needed to oust Apotheker.\par \par \uc2 HP's board met Thursday to finalize the change, having decided that Apotheker had lost the board's confidence in his ability to lead HP long-term, a person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press. This person was not authorized to speak on behalf of HP and spoke on the condition of anonymity.\par \par \uc2 Lane, the HP chairman, defended Apotheker's firing and Whitman's quick selection.\par \par \uc2 The board "objectively evaluated whether he was the right guy to operate the business, and we came to the conclusion that he was not," he said on the conference call. "And we chose someone who is a great operator, who executed in her business for years and has a track record of leadership. I can't think of a name out there over Meg that I would pick to be CEO of this company."\par \par \uc2 Apotheker was also forced to resign from HP's board. Lane's position has been elevated. He was non-executive chairman. He is now executive chairman.\par \par \uc2 An HP spokesman said that Apotheker, Whitman and Lane were not immediately available for interviews.\par \par \uc2 Whitman's likely arrival was greeted warmly on Wednesday, when investors drove the stock up more than 7 percent on reports she was being considered for the job. But most of those gains evaporated Thursday, when fears set in that the company's strategy is still in need of repair.\par \par \uc2 Cathie Lesjak\uc2 , HP's chief financial officer, added to those fears when she disclosed that she isn't sure HP can hit its revenue target of $32.1 billion to $32.5 billion in the quarter ending Oct. 31. She reaffirmed earnings guidance. She blamed weakness across consumer and commercial markets, particularly in Europe.\par \par \uc2 HP's stock fell $1.18, or 4.9 percent, to close at $22.80 on Thursday. It fell another 7 cents in after-hours trading. The declines were worse than the overall market. The Dow Jones industrial average plunged 391 points, or 3.5 percent, on worries that the global economy is headed for another recession.\par \par \uc2 Boosting HP's sagging stock price will be an urgent problem for Whitman.\par \par \uc2 HP's market value has dropped by $60 billion since CEO Mark Hurd was forced out in August of last year over an ethical scandal. Hurd's departure set the stage for Apotheker's appointment as CEO and Lane's appointment as chairman.\par \par \uc2 Proving she can instill order in a disordered company is another pressing issue.\par \par \uc2 EBay, when Whitman inherited it, was a star on the rise. HP is struggling with bloat and hasn't decided on a clear direction. It knows it wants to be more like \uc2 IBM Corp\uc2 ., but has a long way to go to complete the transformation.\par \par \uc2 Steering a startup through a period of growth is markedly different from running an established company that's fallen on hard times, experts say.\par \par \uc2 Whitman touted her business credentials on the campaign trail in her unsuccessful California gubernatorial bid. She spent more than any candidate for a statewide office in U.S. history on the campaign --at least $174 million, most of it her own money.\par \par \uc2 She became a respected executive for her work at \uc2 eBay\uc2 , transforming it from a website with a few dozen employees and less than $100 million in revenue into an industry heavyweight with thousands of workers and billions in sales.\par \par \uc2 But her record as CEO also includes a lesser-known episode that paints a different picture of her abilities to quell a company in disarray. Whitman's time at FTD in the 1990s was her most high-profile turnaround attempt. It did not end well.\par \par \uc2 Whitman has rarely spoken about her time at FTD. It's an imperfect comparison to HP, but Whitman was brought in to the company in 1995 by her former colleagues at investment firm \uc2 Bain & Co\uc2 . to spearhead a major transformation. She was supposed to stay five years, but ended up quitting after two, citing investors' unrealistic goals.\par \par \uc2 "This company is not fixable, at least not by me," Whitman wrote in her book, "The Power of Many." She calls her tenure there "probably the most frustrating and, ultimately, least successful executive experience of my career."\par \par \uc2 Other types of concerns have been raised about Whitman.\par \par \uc2 She was named to HP's board this year as part of a sweeping overhaul under Apotheker and Lane. They were supposed to be steadying hands. But almost immediately, corporate governance experts began crying foul. They took issue with the fact Whitman's hiring by esteemed venture capital firm \uc2 Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers\uc2 , where Lane works, was announced a week after she was formally elected to HP's board.\par \par \uc2 Several unflattering incidents helped scuttle her gubernatorial campaign.\par \par \uc2 She was revealed to have shoved an \uc2 eBay\uc2  employee during a disagreement, which led to a six-figure settlement. Whitman said the altercation was an anomaly and taught her to always be professional. It was also revealed that her former housekeeper of nine years was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 To complicate matters further, Whitman was a board member at \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2  when it allegedly engaged in the now-illegal practice called "spinning," in which wealthy clients and CEOs whose companies did business with Goldman received early access to IPO shares, which they flipped quickly for large profits. Whitman said she forfeited the $1.8 million she made from the deals in a lawsuit she settled with \uc2 eBay\uc2  shareholders.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writer Juliet Williams in Sacramento and AP Business Writer Chip Cutter in New York contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110922e79m002a6\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 HOOVER, Ala. (AP) - Tea party members rallied in support of Alabama's new law against illegal immigration Tuesday, bidding to send a message to a federal judge who is considering legal challenges by opponents who contend the measure is unconstitutional.\par \par \uc2 About 120 people turned out in a park in suburban Birmingham on a rainy evening for a demonstration in favor of the law, which both supporters and critics describe as the nation's toughest on immigration. Among other things, it would make it illegal for anyone to hire an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  or knowingly help one remain in the state.\par \par \uc2 Church-based groups and pro-immigrant groups have staged larger rallies and marches against the law. A key sponsor of the bill, Sen. Scott Beason, said the tea party event was the first he knew of supporting the law, which is temporarily on hold as U.S. District Judge Sharon Blackburn considers opponents' challenges.\par \par \uc2 Tea party leader Zan Green said she and other organizers timed the rally to coincide the Blackburn's review of the law. The judge has said she would rule by Sept. 28 on the constitutionality of the law, which the Obama administration opposes as an overreach by the state into an area of federal authority.\par \par \uc2 "We were trying to do this while the judge is deliberating to let her know there are Alabamians who support this law," said Green, president of the Rainy Day Patriots.\par \par \uc2 Rally participant Marcelo Munoz said Alabama needs the law because the federal government is doing a poor job of enforcing immigration laws. Describing himself as a legal immigrant from Chile, Munoz said backers of the law aren't simply against Hispanics, whose numbers in Alabama more than doubled to about 185,000 in the last decade, according to Census figures.\par \par \uc2 "We're coming out here to show we're not racist. It's not about targeting a particular group. It's about enforcing the law," said Munoz. "There's a lot of common sense stuff in the law."\par \par \uc2 Besides clamping down on businesses that hire illegal immigrants, the law requires schools to find out if students are in the country legally. Police also could arrest anyone during traffic stops on suspicion of immigration violations.\par \par \uc2 Beason, R-Gardendale, described the legislation as a jobs bill meant to insure that legal residents get jobs in Alabama.\par \par \uc2 "This is about putting Alabamians back to work," said Beason, who received a standing ovation.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110921e79l0001c\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - Immigrant rights advocates claim federal immigration raids in Shelbyville were designed to intimidate local Latinos who complained about the way they are treated by law enforcement at a hearing last week -- a claim Immigration and Customs Enforcement denies.\par \par \uc2 Saturday's raids came five days after a hearing attended by representatives from the U.S. Justice Department and the Department of Homeland Security where Latino residents complained that they are the victims of racial profiling and illegal detention.\par \par \uc2 ICE agents showed up at the homes and businesses of at least two people involved in organizing the hearing, witnesses said. Neither person was arrested.\par \par \uc2 Megan Macaraeg, organizing director for the Tennessee Immigrant and Refugee Rights Coalition, described the way Shelbyville Latinos view the raids like this: "That'll teach you to speak up and say bad things about us and bring the feds in."\par \par \uc2 ICE spokesman Temple Black said in an email that allegations the raids were retaliatory are "without merit."\par \par \uc2 "ICE did not attend the meeting, track participants, or target supporters," he wrote. "Rather, wholly apart and distinct from the meeting, ICE identified and arrested three convicted criminals who were living at large in the community."\par \par \uc2 Regardless of the intention, the raids and a continuous show of force by ICE over the past several days has frightened residents, said TIRRC organizer Leticia Alvarez, who was in the store of one of the hearing organizers when ICE agents circled the parking lot, writing down license plate numbers.\par \par \uc2 "Everyone is scared," she said. ..."There is serious panic in the community."\par \par \uc2 A report on last week's hearing -- sponsored by TIRRC, Latinos Unidos de Shelbyville (United Latinos of Shelbyville) and the Washington, D.C.,-based Rights Working Group -- links many of the reported rights abuses to the implementation of Tennessee's "Jailer Bill," which went into effect in January. The bill requires jailers to try to determine whether inmates are legally in the country and alert ICE if they believe someone is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 According to the report, that has led some Shelbyville Police officers to deliberately target Latinos in an attempt to find and deport illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 TIRRC found through open records requests on traffic violations for the first quarter of 2011, that just four officers made 62 percent of the arrests of Latinos for traffic violations.\par \par \uc2 "Since Shelbyville police officers are assigned to patrol throughout the city rather than in a specific area, these statistics suggest that some officers may be intentionally targeting Latino drivers for traffic stops and arrests," the report states.\par \par \uc2 Shelbyville police Chief Austin Swing said he did not know how TIRRC had compiled its numbers, but he does not believe he has any out-of-control officers on his staff. He said he had not heard any complaints of racial profiling before the release of the report on Monday.\par \par \uc2 "If anything like that is going on, I'm not aware of it," he said. He added that he would investigate any substantiated accusations of officer misconduct.\par \par \uc2 The report also claims that, once in jail, Latinos are being held illegally past the time they should be released in order to give ICE more time to decide whether to pick them up for possible deportation proceedings.\par \par \uc2 Bill Geissler, a member of Latinos Unidos de Shelbyville, said he has been to the jail numerous times over the past year on behalf of immigrants and has seen the abuses firsthand.\par \par \uc2 Bedford County Sheriff's Capt. Tony Bennett disputed that, saying that jailers only hold inmates for the amount of time they are legally allowed.\par \par \uc2 "We're doing exactly what the immigration department has asked us to do," he said.\par \par \uc2 And the report claims that ICE's Nashville Fugitive Operations Team asked the Bedford County Probation Office to prepare a list of people with Hispanic-sounding last names to target for deportation.\par \par \uc2 "Latino probationers were profiled based on their perceived national origin," the report states.\par \par \uc2 Macaraeg said the allegations in the report were enough to make TIRRC call for a Justice Department investigation of illegal patterns and practices. The raids on Saturday and a continuous show of force by immigrations agents since then have prompted them to request a fast-track of that process.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110920e79k002d2\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 GOOD HOPE, Ala. (AP) - Farmers in one of Alabama's leading agricultural areas asked legislators Monday to make emergency changes to the state's tough new law against illegal immigration, saying millions of dollars of crops are at risk in coming weeks because of a sudden lack of hands for harvest.\par \par \uc2 The lawmakers said they can't do anything to the law right now, and it may be months before it can be changed.\par \par \uc2 About 50 growers packed a truck-stop dining room 45 miles north of Birmingham. They pleaded with three north Alabama lawmakers to amend the law and save what they called the lifeblood of the state's agriculture operations: The Hispanic workers who pick vegetables, gather chickens from poultry houses, pull sweet potatoes out of the ground and make the cardboard boxes that hold produce.\par \par \uc2 Those workers are leaving the state because they are intimidated by the law and without them, acres and acres of crops will be wasted, the farmers said.\par \par \uc2 Kim Haynes said he's lost about half the workers he needs to gather his 25-acre sweet potato crop. He fears the rest of his Hispanic employees will leave should a federal judge let the law take effect in coming days.\par \par \uc2 "There will be no crops harvested in an effectual manner without them," said Haynes, of Cullman.\par \par \uc2 The law makes it a crime to employ or assist an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  in remaining in the country. It allows police to jail people if they can't prove they are in the United States legally, and the farmers said many Spanish-speaking workers who are in the country both legally and illegally have moved from Alabama in fear.\par \par \uc2 The gathered farmers told lawmakers they'd like to use U.S.-born citizens for the work, but few are willing to sweat in the fields and get dirty even though wages are usually well above minimum wage.\par \par \uc2 "We use Hispanic labor because we have no other choice. We can't find anyone else who will do this work," said Jeremy Calvert of Bremen. Most of the farmers were from Cullman County, but several came to the meeting from elsewhere in north Alabama.\par \par \uc2 State Sen. Paul Bussman, R-Cullman, said GOP Gov. Robert Bentley could issue an executive order changing part of the law, or Bentley could include an amendment to the immigration law in the call for a special legislative session that could be scheduled in coming weeks to help resolve a budget crisis in Jefferson County.\par \par \uc2 Regardless, state Rep. Jeremy Oden said nothing can happen until U.S. District Judge Sharon Blackburn rules on lawsuits seeking to overturn the law. The judge temporarily blocked it from taking effect earlier this month, but she said she would issue a final ruling by Sept. 28 that could clear the way for the tough legislation.\par \par \uc2 "The bill is in place until the judge makes her ruling," said Oden, R-Cullman.\par \par \uc2 Deputy Agriculture Commissioner Wayne Walker said state officials fear it could cost tens of millions of dollars in losses if farmers can't find enough help for harvesting. Tomato growers in east Alabama already are suffering because the law scared away the people who normally pick their crops, he said.\par \par \uc2 Supporters of the Republican-sponsored immigration bill say it was meant to protect jobs for legal residents, and conservative supporters plan a rally in favor of the bill in Birmingham on Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110919e79j0035c\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 DETROIT (AP) - A robbery case has exposed sharp differences at the Michigan Supreme Court over whether a sentence can be enhanced if the victims are illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Chief Justice Robert Young Jr. broke with the court's conservative bloc and joined three liberal justices in letting a minimum five-year prison sentence stand against Jorge Torres-David.\par \par \uc2 A Wayne County judge added points to the sentencing formula in 2009 after finding that Torres-David targeted illegal immigrants because he believed they would be reluctant to complain to police. The Michigan appeals court denied an appeal, and the Supreme Court last week said it wouldn't hear the case.\par \par \uc2 It was a 4-3 decision, with Young joining Democratic justices Marilyn Kelly, Diane Hathaway and Michael Cavanagh -- a rare alignment.\par \par \uc2 "I believe undocumented aliens are vulnerable victims ... when offenders view them as easy targets because they fear contact with the police. It is for that reason that 15 points were properly assessed," Kelly said.\par \par \uc2 The court's order didn't explain the impact that the scoring had on Torres-David's five-to-15-year prison sentence. A message seeking comment was left for his attorney Monday.\par \par \uc2 In a dissent, Justice Stephen Markman said the "remarkable" decision means illegal immigrants in Michigan now have greater protections as crime victims than law-abiding residents.\par \par \uc2 "I do not agree that illegal alien status somehow transforms those persons into `vulnerable' victims, so that crimes committed against them are to be punished more severely than identical crimes against citizens and legal aliens," said Markman, whose remarks were endorsed by justices Mary Beth Kelly and Brian Zahra.\par \par \uc2 "It is hardly a `vulnerability' akin to a physical or mental disability, or analogous to youth or agedness," he wrote.\par \par \uc2 F. Martin Tieber, a lawyer who specializes in criminal appeals, said the order is not the same as a formal precedent-setting opinion by the Supreme Court.\par \par \uc2 "But the order could make it easier for prosecutors in cases where illegal immigrants are victims," he said.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110919e79j002jm\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

Republicans seek to revive their party's sagging fortunes by reaching out to Hispanics\b0\par\par\uc2 By JULIET WILLIAMS   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 1,051 \uc2 words\par \uc2 17 September 2011\par 20:01\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2011.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 LOS ANGELES (AP) - After failing to keep pace with California's shifting demographics, the state Republican Party is attempting a revival by revamping its strategy to appeal to the fastest-growing segment of the state's electorate.\par \par \uc2 Yet transcending divisions with Hispanics on immigration issues and focusing on other matters such as education and the economy will not be easy for a party that now registers less than a third of the state's voters.\par \par \uc2 Even as party leaders talked about creating a sustainable strategy for Hispanic outreach, much of the lineup at the California Republican Party convention in Los Angeles this weekend would seem to be at odds with those goals. The headliners are two conservative presidential candidates who are unlikely to appeal to mainstream voters, much less many Hispanics in California: tea party favorite Michele Bachmann and small-government icon Ron Paul, who drew hundreds of enthusiastic supporters to his morning events.\par \par \uc2 Saturday's events featured a first for California Republicans, a town hall conversation hosted by a popular Spanish-language television host about how the party can connect with Hispanics. It will air next weekend on the Spanish-language television network Univision.\par \par \uc2 Party Chairman Tom del Beccaro, who took over in March, called the outreach plan unprecedented, mostly because he said Republicans plan to follow through this time.\par \par \uc2 "The dynamic today is that we have a single point of discussion in this country between Republicans and Latinos, which is immigration," he said. "As important as that is, so are jobs, so is education and so are public safety. And the fact that we don't have ongoing discussions with them on these other categories is our fault and what needs to change."\par \par \uc2 Having seen such efforts come and go in years past, some moderates are going around the formal party mechanism in their own bid to appeal to Hispanics.\par \par \uc2 Hector Barajas, a former communications director for the party who is now a consultant to Spanish-language television network Univision, is leading a program to recruit Hispanic Republican candidates for local office. The first target is Los Angeles County, heavily Democratic and Hispanic.\par \par \uc2 The effort, called Grow Elect, has a roster of 15 candidates competing for school board, city council and other local seats this November.

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc62}{\*\bkmkend toc62}\b \uc2 Calif. Republicans seek to revive their party's sagging fortunes by reaching out to Hispanics\b0\par\par\uc2 By JULIET WILLIAMS   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 947 \uc2 words\par \uc2 17 September 2011\par 19:16\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2011.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 LOS ANGELES (AP) - After failing to keep pace with California's shifting demographics, the state Republican Party is attempting a revival by revamping its strategy to appeal to the fastest-growing segment of the state's electorate.\par \par \uc2 Yet transcending divisions with Hispanics on immigration issues and focusing on other matters such as education and the economy will not be easy for a party that now registers less than a third of the state's voters.\par \par \uc2 Even as party leaders talked about creating a sustainable strategy for Hispanic outreach, much of the lineup at the California Republican Party convention in Los Angeles this weekend would seem to be at odds with those goals. The headliners are two conservative presidential candidates who are unlikely to appeal to mainstream voters, much less many Hispanics in California: tea party favorite Michele Bachmann and small-government icon Ron Paul, who drew hundreds of enthusiastic supporters to his morning events.\par \par \uc2 Saturday's series of events featured a first for California Republicans, a town hall conversation hosted by a popular Spanish-language television host about how the party can connect with Hispanics. It will air later on the Spanish-language television network Univision.\par \par \uc2 Party Chairman Tom del Beccaro, who took over in March, called the outreach plan unprecedented, mostly because he said Republicans plan to follow through this time.\par \par \uc2 "The dynamic today is that we have a single point of discussion in this country between Republicans and Latinos, which is immigration," he said. "As important as that is, so are jobs, so is education and so are public safety. And the fact that we don't have ongoing discussions with them on these other categories is our fault and what needs to change."\par \par \uc2 Having seen such efforts come and go in years past, some moderates are going around the formal party mechanism in their own bid to appeal to Hispanics.\par \par \uc2 Hector Barajas, a former communications director for the party who is now a consultant to Spanish-language television network Univision, is leading a program to recruit Hispanic Republican candidates for local office. The first target is Los Angeles County, heavily Democratic and Hispanic.\par \par \uc2 The effort, called Grow Elect, has a roster of 15 candidates competing for school board, city council and other local seats this November. Barajas said Republicans too often mistake "a mariachi band and Mexican food" for genuine outreach to Hispanics.\par \par \uc2 "I was an employee for the party for eight years, and you know, there would always be a program," to appeal to Hispanic voters during elections, he said. "Once the campaign ended, the program would end. Then there'd be another program that would end. There was no sustainability on anything."\par \par \uc2 He said the party must have an outreach program that is sustainable regardless of internal politics or who the chairman is.\par \par \uc2 Voters identify most closely with their local officials, Barajas said, and minority groups often rely on "third-party validators" in their community for advice on voting and other matters.\par \par \uc2 The next step will be getting the effort to translate at the polls, especially in statewide elections.\par \par \uc2 In 2008, a splinter group of Republicans with ties to then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger announced a well-funded effort to recruit more moderate candidates with greater appeal to minority voters. Last year, Republican leaders promised that Hispanics would turn out in record numbers, pulled in by former \uc2 eBay\uc2  chief executive Meg Whitman's multimillion-dollar outreach efforts in her failed run for governor.\par \par \uc2 Those efforts fizzled by Election Day after revelations that Whitman had fired her \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  maid. She lost the race by 13 percentage points to Democrat Jerry Brown in an election that saw Democratic candidates sweep every statewide office.\par \par \uc2 "She was trying to make up for 15 years of a consistent lack of engagement," del Beccaro said.\par \par \uc2 GOP registration has been sliding for years, with Republicans now accounting for 31 percent of registered voters, compared to 44 percent for Democrats and about 20 percent for independents.\par \par \uc2 Any strategy to revive that registration cannot succeed without persuading Hispanics, who comprise a third of the California electorate.\par \par \uc2 Many Hispanics believe Republicans don't care about them or the government programs they believe help them, said Selena Sanchez, 27. The preschool teacher from Riverside came to the convention Saturday to support Paul, the presidential candidate who advocated a Libertarian-inspired minimalist view of government that includes withdrawing the U.S. from NATO and eliminating the Federal Reserve.\par \par \uc2 "Maybe that's where the fear comes from -- `What would we do without it?'" said Sanchez, who is a Republican. "Democrats talk in a way that makes people feel good, but what they're doing in government is hurting everybody."\par \par \uc2 Next year's elections will hold wild cards for all candidates, regardless of party. New legislative and congressional districts drawn by an independent citizens' panel and a top-two primary system are expected to force candidates to appeal to a broader cross-section of voters. In theory, that creates opportunities for moderate Republican candidates.\par \par \uc2 Whether die-hard Republicans will support candidates who can appeal to mainstream California remains to be seen. An internal struggle over whether the party should hold tight to conservative principles on guns, gay marriage and abortion or shift to the middle is ongoing at this weekend's gathering.\par \par \uc2 Moderates led by wealthy GOP donor and Stanford University physicist Charles Munger Jr. want to revamp the party platform so it emphasizes economic issues and fewer government regulations instead of social issues.\par \par \uc2 The party delayed a decision on the changes until next February.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110917e79h000sq\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SRINAGAR, India (AP) - A state-run human rights commission has broadened its investigation into unmarked graves in the Indian portion of Kashmir to include thousands more in two additional districts, officials said Friday.\par \par \uc2 The Jammu-Kashmir State Human Rights Commission is looking into residents' claims of 3,844 unmarked graves at 208 locations in the remote districts of Rajouri and Poonch. The commission asked the state government on Friday to provide any information it has on those graves within the next month, commission secretary Tariq Banday said.\par \par \uc2 In August, the commission concluded an investigation into unmarked graves in three other districts in Kashmir, issuing a report saying they held more than 2,700 bullet-riddled bodies, about 80 percent them unidentified and the rest local residents.\par \par \uc2 It was the first official acknowledgment that some civilians killed in the region's more than two-decade insurgency may have been buried in unmarked graves, although the commission stopped short of confirming that position, which has been long held by local residents and rights groups.\par \par \uc2 Previously, Indian authorities had maintained that the bodies were of militants of foreign origin who sneaked into the Indian portion of Kashmir from Pakistani territory to fight government forces.\par \par \uc2 Local rights groups long alleged that the graves might contain bodies of Kashmiri civilians who disappeared and possibly were killed by government forces over suspicions of collaborating with rebels.\par \par \uc2 Rebel groups began fighting in 1989 against Indian rule, and more than 68,000 people, most of them civilians, have been killed in the uprising and subsequent Indian crackdowns.\par \par \uc2 India accuses Pakistan of arming and training rebel fighters, but Pakistan says it only offers moral and diplomatic support for their cause. India and Pakistan have fought two wars since 1947 over Kashmir.\par \par \uc2 Local rights groups say that some 8,000 people have disappeared in the disputed region since 1989 and they accuse Indian forces of staging gunbattles to cover up the killings. They also say government forces have arrested hundreds of suspected rebels and that nobody has heard from them.\par \par \uc2 The state government has denied those charges, and has said that the missing could be Kashmiri youths who crossed over to Pakistan for weapons training.\par \par \uc2 The International People's Tribunal on Human Rights and Justice, a Srinagar-based group, said some graves could have the bodies of "\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  workers from different parts of India and Bangladesh" who use the region to cross over to Pakistan on their way to oil-rich Gulf countries in search of jobs.\par \par \uc2 "According to the allegations made by local people, many of these \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  workers after being caught by the Indian army were being imprisoned; many were killed in fake encounters and branded as foreign militants," the rights group said.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110916e79g001sa\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

Kingpins' pets create a challenge for Mexican zoos\b0\par\par\uc2 By MANUEL VALDES   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 927 \uc2 words\par \uc2 16 September 2011\par 17:21\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2011.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 TOLUCA, Mexico (AP) - For years, three tiny squirrel monkeys led a life of luxury on a 16-acre ranch surrounded by extravagant gardens and barns built for purebred horses.\par \par \uc2 More than 200 animals, ranging from mules to peacocks and ostricheslived on the ranch in central Mexico and hundreds more stayed on two related properties, many in opulent enclosures. Also kept on the grounds were less furry fare: AK-47 assault rifles, Berrettas, hundreds of other weapons and cocaine.\par \par \uc2 The ranch's owner was Jesus "The King" Zambada, a leader of the powerful Sinaloa drug cartel. He had developed a love for exotic species shared with other kingpins. Just two days before Zambada's arrest, police confiscated two tigers and two lions from a drug gang hideout on the forested outskirts of Mexico City.\par \par \uc2 As federal authorities capture a growing number of gang leaders, many of their pets are being driven from their gilded cages into more modest housing in the country's zoos.\par \par \uc2 That's proved overwhelming for some institutions, which are struggling to cope with the influx. But it's also giving Mexican animal lovers a bounty of new creatures to admire.\par \par \uc2 Like Zambada, who was apprehended in October 2008, the squirrel monkeys sit in state custody, chirping away at gawking children at the Zacango Zoo, about an hour outside Mexico City.\par \par \uc2 Their previous home "was a very big enclosure made of good quality material," said Manlio Nucamendi, the zoo's coordinator. "But they didn't have the right diet and medical attention."\par \par \uc2 Mexican forces have discovered drug cartel private zoos that housed tigers, panthers and lions among other animals of exotic breeds, though the federal Attorney General's Office, which supervises all seizures from drug gangs, couldn't provide an exact count of the number of animals seized.\par \par \uc2 Whatever the number, officials have been challenged to house the armies of confiscated drug cartel animals.\par \par \uc2 "Within the limited resources of the Mexican government, there are a lot of efforts to ensure the welfare of these animals," said Adrian Reuter Cortes of the conservation group the World Wildlife Fund in Mexico. "But even the zoos have limits, and can't welcome all the animals."\par \par \uc2 The government usually calls zoos for help because they have the expertise, equipment and vehicles to transport large animals, said Frank Carlos Camacho, executive director of the wild animal park Africam Safari in the central Mexico city of Puebla and president of the national association of zoos.\par \par \uc2 "There's some risk involved in handling animals like big cats, bears and large herbivores," Camacho said.\par \par \uc2 He said he has heard of drug cartel zoos that included giraffes, buffalos and camels.\par \par \uc2 As the cinematic gangster film "Scarface" portrayed in 1983, private zoos have long been considered status symbols for drug kingpins eager to show off their wealth.\par \par \uc2 Descendants of Colombian drug boss Pablo Escobar's hippopotamuses still roam his private zoo in Colombia, which became state property after his killing and is now a tourist attraction. Three of the beasts escaped and lived in the wild for two years.\par \par \uc2 Some kingpins also use the beasts for more nefarious purposes.\par \par \uc2 Leaders of the ruthless Mexican Zetas cartel have been rumored to feed victims to lions and tigers kept in their properties, local media have reported.\par \par \uc2 Animals are also used in the drug trade as smugglers. Over the past couple of years, traffickers have tried to ship drugs inside frozen, cocaine-stuffed sharks, snakes fed with bags of cocaine and bags filled with transparent liquid cocaine inside containers shipping tropical fish, Reuter Cortes said.\par \par \uc2 As with drugs, Mexico is a main corridor for the illegal trafficking of animals to the United States. The country also has a healthy domestic demand for animals, with big cats found in some urban markets.\par \par \uc2 In July, Mexican authorities seized more than 5,500 illegal animals and plants during a nationwide three-day operation.\par \par \uc2 Not all exotic animals, however, are as lucky as Zambada's monkeys. Many animals found in drug cartel captivity or in private homes suffer from malnutrition or have been de-clawed or de-fanged, said Nucamendi.\par \par \uc2 "It's a symbol of status and power," he said. "It's a bizarre psychology for the people that keep these animals."\par \par \uc2 As he showed off the zoo's grounds on a recent afternoon, Nucamendi jumped over a barrier and knelt to greet Diego, a 2-year-old jaguar, who responded by pressing his face against the chain-link fence. Diego's former owners in Tijuana used to charge for pictures with him, Nucamendi said.\par \par \uc2 Elsewhere in the zoo was a 3-decade-old elephant seized from a circus because his owners didn't have the proper permits. Workers joke that the elephant is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  because he was sneaked from the U.S. to Mexico.\par \par \uc2 An 8-month-old male lion cub, also called Diego, arrived malnourished from private owners. Now fatter, Diego plays with two other lion cubs also on exhibit.\par \par \uc2 As for the squirrel monkeys, they'll be moved to a bigger exhibit being planned in a remodeling of the zoo.\par \par \uc2 Although some of the confiscated animals had finer housing before, their new homes offer genuine care from the people watching them.\par \par \uc2 "It's more important for us to guarantee the welfare of these animals than the criminal investigations," Nucamendi said. "That's our duty. We offer our bodies and souls for the welfare of these animals."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110916e79g001oz\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) - The flow of driver's licenses to immigrants has slowed in New Mexico since the state tightened its application system last year, but the drop-off steepened after Republican Gov. Susana Martinez took office in January promising to end the licensing policy, according to a review of state records by The Associated Press.\par \par \uc2 Martinez has unsuccessfully pressed the Democratic-controlled Legislature to repeal New Mexico's immigrant license law, but fewer licenses are being issued to foreign nationals as the political debate intensifies. New Mexico is one of only three states where illegal immigrants can be issued a driver's license.\par \par \uc2 New immigrant licenses -- those issued for the first time to people without a Social Security number -- dropped 57 percent during the first seven months of the Martinez administration compared to the same period a year ago under her predecessor, Democrat Bill Richardson.\par \par \uc2 Immigrant licenses in New Mexico declined 44 percent in the past 12 months compared with the previous one-year period, according to license numbers obtained from the state in response to a public records request by the AP.\par \par \uc2 The decline started in August 2010 after illegal immigrants and other foreign nationals were required to make an appointment for a driver's license at a Motor Vehicle Division office, rather than walking in at any time for the transaction.\par \par \uc2 New Mexico, Washington and Utah are the only states where an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  can get a license to drive because no Social Security number or proof of immigration status is required of applicants.\par \par \uc2 However, Utah's permit can't be used as an ID and the state changed its law this year to require a background check and fingerprinting of immigrants applying for a driving privilege card.\par \par \uc2 Washington has seen a drop in foreign national licenses this year, apparently because it tightened rules for showing residency by applicants without a Social Security number.\par \par \uc2 About 92,000 foreign national licenses have been issued in New Mexico from 2003 through July, according to Taxation and Revenue Department records. However, state officials do not know how many went to illegal immigrants because license applicants are not required to submit information about their immigration status.\par \par \uc2 New Mexico experienced a surge in foreign nationals getting licenses early last year after crackdowns on illegal immigrants in neighboring Arizona and elsewhere. But that abruptly changed after the Richardson administration implemented the appointment system in late July 2010. The number of new licenses dropped by more than half the next month.\par \par \uc2 An average of 22 foreign national licenses have been issued daily from January through July this year. That's down from 52 a day during the same period last year and an average of 38 a day in 2009, according to an AP analysis of state records\par \par \uc2 A total of 9,079 new foreign national licenses were granted from August 2010 through July 2011 -- a drop of about 7,200 from the previous 12 months.\par \par \uc2 An immigrant rights group says the appointment system has lengthened the licensing process and created more difficulties for applicants.\par \par \uc2 "Most of the folks that we know within the last year who have been trying to get licenses have had to wait between four and seven months to get through the whole process," said Marcela Diaz, executive director of Somos Un Pueblo Unido.\par \par \uc2 An applicant may not initially bring the correct documents to an appointment and has to return after making another appointment. It can be difficult to schedule an appointment, she said, and the group has received more complaints from immigrants about administrative problems since Martinez took office.\par \par \uc2 Scott Darnell, a spokesman for Martinez, said, "Necessarily establishing an appointment schedule prevents MVD offices from being flooded with individuals looking to obtain a foreign national driver's license. It constrains the number of licenses that can be issued each day."\par \par \uc2 Martinez contends New Mexico has become a magnet for fraud and out-of-state immigrants trying to get a driver's license that can be used as ID elsewhere. But supporters say the license law improves public safety, lessening fear among immigrants to cooperate with police in reporting crimes and bolstering compliance with insurance requirements for motorists.\par \par \uc2 Darnell said the Martinez administration "is taking the oversight of this program and the security of New Mexico driver's licenses far more seriously than did the previous administration."\par \par \uc2 When the Richardson administration implemented the appointment system, MVD's director said the change could improve security by giving the agency more time to review documents submitted by applicants. It also was to reduce the waiting time for customers in an MVD office because an immigrant license application usually is a lengthy transaction.\par \par \uc2 Foreign national license applicants must pass written and driving tests as well as provide documents proving their identity and New Mexico residency. Those without a Social Security number can submit a taxpayer identification number issued by the federal government along with other identification such as a passport and a Matricula Consular card from a Mexican consulate in Albuquerque or El Paso, Texas.\par \par \uc2 An MVD clerk issues a 45-day driving permit if a foreign national's application is accepted, but the documents undergo a final check by tax fraud investigators before a permanent driver's license is mailed. A spokesman for the Taxation and Revenue Department says investigators cross reference some information, such as addresses and phone numbers, to look for "red flags."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Follow Barry Massey on Twitter at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://twitter.com/bmasseyAP"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://twitter.com/bmasseyAP}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110915e79f000mo\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

That's down from 52 a day during the same period last year and an average of 38 a day in 2009, according to an AP analysis of state records\par \par \uc2 A total of 9,079 new foreign national licenses were granted from August 2010 through July 2011 -- a drop of about 7,200 from the previous 12 months.\par \par \uc2 An immigrant rights group says the appointment system has lengthened the licensing process and created more difficulties for applicants.\par \par \uc2 "Most of the folks that we know within the last year who have been trying to get licenses have had to wait between four and seven months to get through the whole process," said Marcela Diaz, executive director of Somos Un Pueblo Unido.\par \par \uc2 An applicant may not initially bring the correct documents to an appointment and has to return after making another appointment. It can be difficult to schedule an appointment, she said, and the group has received more complaints from immigrants about administrative problems since Martinez took office.\par \par \uc2 Scott Darnell, a spokesman for Martinez, said, "Necessarily establishing an appointment schedule prevents MVD offices from being flooded with individuals looking to obtain a foreign national driver's license. It constrains the number of licenses that can be issued each day."\par \par \uc2 Martinez contends New Mexico has become a magnet for fraud and out-of-state immigrants trying to get a driver's license that can be used as ID elsewhere. But supporters say the license law improves public safety, lessening fear among immigrants to cooperate with police in reporting crimes and bolstering compliance with insurance requirements for motorists.\par \par \uc2 Darnell said the Martinez administration "is taking the oversight of this program and the security of New Mexico driver's licenses far more seriously than did the previous administration."\par \par \uc2 When the Richardson administration implemented the appointment system, MVD's director said the change could improve security by giving the agency more time to review documents submitted by applicants. It also was to reduce the waiting time for customers in an MVD office because an immigrant license application usually is a lengthy transaction.\par \par \uc2 Foreign national license applicants must pass written and driving tests as well as provide documents proving their identity and New Mexico residency. Those without a Social Security number can submit a taxpayer identification number issued by the federal government along with other identification such as a passport and a Matricula Consular card from a Mexican consulate in Albuquerque or El Paso, Texas.\par \par \uc2 An MVD clerk issues a 45-day driving permit if a foreign national's application is accepted, but the documents undergo a final check by tax fraud investigators before a permanent driver's license is mailed. A spokesman for the Taxation and Revenue Department says investigators cross reference some information, such as addresses and phone numbers, to look for "red flags."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Follow Barry Massey on Twitter at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://twitter.com/bmasseyAP"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://twitter.com/bmasseyAP}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110914e79e00231\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 JACKSON, Miss. (AP) - An \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Mexico plans to plead guilty to participating in a group that allegedly created and distributed fake identification documents, according to federal court records in Mississippi.\par \par \uc2 Pastor Quihua-Gonzalez is one of 11 people charged in an alleged scheme to make fake Social Security cards, driver's licenses and state identification cards. Most of the defendants are illegal immigrants. Prosecutors say they've identified approximately 80 real identities that were used in the production of the fraudulent documents.\par \par \uc2 Quihua-Gonzalez's attorney, Maura D. McLaughlin, said in court records Friday that Quihua-Gonzalez, 25, intends to plead guilty to conspiracy. U.S. District Judge Keith Starrett set a court date for Oct. 6 in Hattiesburg.\par \par \uc2 McLaughlin didn't immediately respond to a message Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 Court records detailed a sophisticated operation in which names and pictures were allegedly sent by cell phones and then used for fake documents. There also was a hierarchy in the group, with some acting as managers and other working as runners, court records said.\par \par \uc2 One person allegedly involved arranged to sell an identification card and Social Security card with matching names for $600, the indictment said.\par \par \uc2 The indictment doesn't list every state from which documents were allegedly faked, but it does mention Texas and Pennsylvania.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors say the group operated in Hattiesburg and Laurel. Laurel was the site of the nation's largest workplace raid on illegal immigrants when nearly 600 workers were rounded up at a factory there in 2008. Most were deported, but others were charged with identity theft and fraud.\par \par \uc2 Authorities say the group in the current case is not connected to those who faced similar charges after the raid on \uc2 Howard Industries\uc2  in Laurel.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110913e79d0019a\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) - A judge is allowing Republican Gov. Susana Martinez's administration to move ahead with a limited investigation to determine whether some immigrants with a New Mexico driver's license still live in the state.\par \par \uc2 District Judge Sarah Singleton on Tuesday decided that some residency checks can continue although she's putting on hold the administration's broad plan for potentially certifying the licenses of tens of thousands of foreign nationals, including those living illegally in the country.\par \par \uc2 The judge said she will issue an injunction to block the program pending the outcome of a lawsuit brought by the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund.\par \par \uc2 New Mexico is one of only three states -- the others are Washington and Utah -- where an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  can get a driver's license because no proof of citizenship is required. However, Utah's permits cannot be used as government ID cards.\par \par \uc2 Martinez wants the Legislature to repeal a 2003 law that allows illegal immigrants to get a driver's license. She contends the state has become a magnet for license fraud and out-of-state immigrants coming to New Mexico only to get a license and then leave.\par \par \uc2 More than 80,000 licenses have been issued so far to foreign nationals although the state is uncertain how many went to illegal immigrants because it doesn't ask applicants about their immigration status.\par \par \uc2 To help detect possible license fraud, the state mailed notices this summer to a random sample of 10,000 foreign nationals saying they must schedule appointments and submit documents proving they still live in New Mexico. The administration had planned to expand the certification program to more foreign nationals if it determined there were widespread problems.\par \par \uc2 Under the judge's decision, the state can't expand the license certification program and send out more notices requiring immigrant license holders to make appointments and submit documents proving they still live in New Mexico. The administration also won't be able follow up and try to verify the licenses of about 4,000 foreign nationals who never responded to certification notices from the state or missed scheduled appointments.\par \par \uc2 However, the judge will allow the state to investigate some pending cases to determine whether license holders remain New Mexico residents, and it's possible the administration will be able to take action to try to cancel licenses if it finds evidence that people fraudulently obtained a license.\par \par \uc2 There's a disagreement between lawyers for the administration and the MALDEF over the scope of the investigation that will be allowed. The judge may be forced to resolve the dispute next week when she plans to issue the injunction sought by MALDEF to stop the program while the lawsuit moves ahead.\par \par \uc2 Until an order is issued next week, the judge has put all parts of the program on hold.\par \par \uc2 About a third of the 10,000 notices were returned as undeliverable, including that there was no such address or there was no forwarding address, according to the administration. Under the judge's decision, the Taxation and Revenue Department and its Motor Vehicle Division can continue to try to track down those license holders.\par \par \uc2 "The court's ruling acknowledges that serious cases of potential fraud have been uncovered as a result of the residency certification program, and that these cases deserve a thorough investigation," said Scott Darnell, a spokesman for Martinez.\par \par \uc2 David Hinojosa, southwest regional counsel for MALDEF, said the judge's ruling will stop the administration's "fishing expedition."\par \par \uc2 The group's lawsuit contends the certification program violates constitutional protections by unfairly singling out certain license holders, including many Hispanics.\par \par \uc2 Hinojosa said MALDF will ask the judge to limit the administration's investigation and prevent it from using information gathered from certification notices, which the group views as unlawful. He contends the administration so far hasn't provided evidence of fraud among the roughly 3,000 notices that were returned as undeliverable.\par \par \uc2 According to the administration, 1,316 licenses have been certified through the program and 183 cases have been sent to state fraud investigators for closer review because of suspicious documents.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Follow Barry Massey on Twitter at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://twitter.com/bmasseyAP"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://twitter.com/bmasseyAP}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110913e79d000tc\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 HONOLULU (AP) - A federal judge on Monday sentenced a decorated former Maui police officer to a year and a half in prison for extorting sex from a woman shortly after she was released from jail and stealing about $1,500 from a driver during a traffic stop.\par \par \uc2 U.S. District Court Magistrate Judge Richard Puglisi gave Kristopher Galon one year for sexual assault and six months for theft. The 38-year-old must also pay restitution to his victims.\par \par \uc2 "A police officer is supposed to be out there to defend and protect, and put forward the best foot in the community," Puglisi told Galon at the sentencing. "I view these crimes as incredibly serious. It's the public trust that will take some time to recover."\par \par \uc2 Assistant U.S. Attorney Susan Cushman had asked Puglisi to sentence Galon to one year in prison.\par \par \uc2 Galon was a decorated officer before the charges forced him to give up his job. The Maui News reported he received the Silver Medal of Valor in 2004 for saving an unconscious driver from a vehicle after its engine exploded.\par \par \uc2 He pleaded guilty to the charges in May.\par \par \uc2 The plea agreement says Galon sexually assaulted a woman shortly after she was released from jail at the Lahaina police station in August 2008. While wearing his police uniform, and on duty, Galon pulled up to the woman in his marked police car and offered her a ride home. He agreed to help her to with the potential criminal charges pending against her, and forced her to engage in a sex act.\par \par \uc2 Nine months earlier, Galon stopped an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Honduras for an alleged traffic violation. During a pat-down search, Galon took the driver's wallet, which contained $1,561 in cash. He warned the man not to drive, since he was in the U.S. illegally, and returned the wallet to him with the cash removed, according to the document.\par \par \uc2 Galon told Puglisi that he's punished for what he did every day when he looks at himself in the mirror. He said he accepted responsibility for his actions.\par \par \uc2 "The hardest thing is to explain to my 5-year-old son why I'm not a policeman anymore," Galon said.\par \par \uc2 He is due to report to the Federal Detention Center in Honolulu on Oct. 24 to begin serving his sentence.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110913e79d00074\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 HONOLULU (AP) - A federal judge on Monday sentenced a decorated former Maui police officer to a year and a half in prison for extorting sex from a woman shortly after she was released from jail and stealing about $1,500 from a driver during a traffic stop.\par \par \uc2 U.S. District Court Magistrate Judge Richard Puglisi gave Kristopher Galon one year for sexual assault and six months for theft. Galon must also pay restitution to his victims.\par \par \uc2 "A police officer is supposed to be out there to defend and protect, and put forward the best foot in the community," Puglisi told Galon at the sentencing. "I view these crimes as incredibly serious. It's the public trust that will take some time to recover."\par \par \uc2 Assistant U.S. Attorney Susan Cushman had asked Puglisi to sentence Galon to one year in prison.\par \par \uc2 Galon was a decorated officer before the charges forced him to give up his job. The Maui News reported he received the Silver Medal of Valor in 2004 for saving an unconscious driver from a vehicle after its engine exploded.\par \par \uc2 He pleaded guilty to the charges in May.\par \par \uc2 The plea agreement says Galon sexually assaulted a woman shortly after she was released from jail at the Lahaina police station in August 2008. While wearing his police uniform, and on duty, Galon pulled up to the woman in his marked police car and offered her a ride home. He agreed to help her to with the potential criminal charges pending against her, and forced her to engage in a sex act.\par \par \uc2 Nine months earlier, Galon stopped an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Honduras for an alleged traffic violation. During a pat-down search, Galon took the driver's wallet, which contained $1,561 in cash. He warned the man not to drive, since he was in the U.S. illegally, and returned the wallet to him with the cash removed, according to the document.\par \par \uc2 Galon told Puglisi that he's punished for what he did every day when he looks at himself in the mirror and accepted responsibility for his actions.\par \par \uc2 "The hardest thing is to explain to my 5-year-old son why I'm not a policeman anymore," Galon said.\par \par \uc2 He is due to report to the Federal Detention Center in Honolulu on Oct. 24 to begin serving his sentence.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110912e79c001dr\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) - New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez has acknowledged her paternal grandparents came to the U.S. illegally, amid national attention and protests over her ongoing efforts to bar illegal immigrants from getting driver's licenses.\par \par \uc2 "I know they arrived without documents, especially my father's father," the Republican said Wednesday in an interview in Spanish with KLUZ-TV, the Albuquerque Univision affiliate.\par \par \uc2 Martinez has long acknowledged her Mexican heritage. But when asked previously about reports that her grandfather was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , her office has said Martinez was unsure of his status since he abandoned the family when her father was young.\par \par \uc2 Her comments Wednesday appeared to be the first time she has answered the question definitively. The Santa Fe New Mexican reported in July that the 1930 U.S. Census Bureau record lists Martinez's paternal grandparents' citizenship status as "AL" for "alien," a status that refers to "all foreign-born persons neither naturalized nor having first papers." However, Martinez was not directly quoted in the story addressing her grandparents' immigration status.\par \par \uc2 Martinez spokesman Scott Darnell said Thursday the governor had just recently learned of her grandparents' immigration status through media reports that cited census records showing her grandfather entered the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 "The governor has no reason to question that 1930 Census record about her grandfather and has always known, and publicly spoken of the fact for years, that her family roots trace back to Mexico," Darnell said.\par \par \uc2 "It's unfortunate that some are choosing to personally attack the governor, but these tactics prove that supporters of giving driver's licenses to illegal immigrants have run out of legitimate defenses for a bad policy."\par \par \uc2 Martinez has made headlines recently for her push to repeal a state law that lets illegal immigrants get a New Mexico driver's license. She has added the issue to the agenda for a special session on redistricting that opened Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 New Mexico is one of only three states -- the others are Washington and Utah -- where an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  can get a driver's license because no proof of citizenship is required.\par \par \uc2 Martinez argues New Mexico's law jeopardizes public safety and attracts illegal immigrants who fraudulently claim to live in the state only to get ID cards that make it easier to stay in the country. Immigrant advocates, however, say the law allows more drivers to be insured in the state and helps law enforcement obtain needed safety data. They say the fraud cases Martinez often cites for reasons to change the law are isolated.\par \par \uc2 A similar repeal effort by Martinez failed in the state Senate during the regular session earlier this year. Martinez said she wanted legislators to take up the repeal again, despite some lawmakers' complaints that they should focus largely on redistricting.\par \par \uc2 It's unclear if lawmakers will have time to reconsider the repeal during the 30-day special session. But that hasn't stopped immigrant advocates from coming to Santa Fe to rally against the possible repeal.\par \par \uc2 In protests this week in Santa Fe, advocates and some religious leaders cited Martinez's family history as a reason the governor should drop her effort to repeal the driver's license law.\par \par \uc2 At a rally Thursday, protesters held posters bearing a likeness of a driver's license with a photograph of Martinez. A placard read: "Dear Susana. Do you know your history? Did you forget your roots?"\par \par \uc2 Martinez grew up in El Paso and is the nation's first elected Latina governor. She has called the issue of her family's immigrant past irrelevant, arguing immigration laws were different when her grandfather came from Mexico in the 1920s.\par \par \uc2 But Guadalupe San Miguel Jr., an author and University of Houston history professor, said immigration laws during the time Martinez says her grandparents came to the United States weren't much different than they are now. Those coming to the U.S. were subjected to a number of requirements if they wanted to stay legally, he said.\par \par \uc2 "What was different then was the lack of enforcement," San Miguel said. "The border patrol was created in 1917, and there were just a handful of border patrol agents. There was no way they could enforce the law."\par \par \uc2 San Miguel said because of the lack of enforcement Mexican immigrants and Mexican Americans went back of forth between Mexico and the United States with little problems.\par \par \uc2 Lisa Y. Ramos, a Texas A&M University history professor, said most multigenerational Mexican Americans like Martinez have "at least one family member with an undocumented past" due to that free range of movement along the border in early part of the 20th century.\par \par \uc2 "But Mexican Americans weren't the only ones who have this undocumented past," said Ramos, who is writing a book on the Mexican-American civil rights movement. "A lot of other multigenerational Americans do, too, like Italian Americans."\par \par \uc2 In fact, then-Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., acknowledged in 2007 during a debate over a failed immigration bill that his mother was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Italy and was briefly detained by federal agents during World War II when he was a child. She eventually became a U.S. citizen.\par \par \uc2 But Ramos said the irony about Martinez's past is that she might not be governor of New Mexico today if her grandparents hadn't made the decision to enter the U.S. the way they did, when they did.\par \par \uc2 "She wouldn't be there if her grandfather, who was undocumented, hadn't come," Ramos said.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writer Jeri Clausing contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Follow Russell Contreras on Twitter at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://twitter.com/russcontreras"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://twitter.com/russcontreras}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110909e7990005d\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

"A lot of other multigenerational Americans do, too, like Italian Americans."\par \par \uc2 In fact, then-Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., acknowledged in 2007 during a debate over a failed immigration bill that his mother was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Italy and was briefly detained by federal agents during World War II when he was a child. She eventually became a U.S. citizen.\par \par \uc2 But Ramos said the irony about Martinez's past is that she might not be governor of New Mexico today if her grandparents hadn't made the decision to enter the U.S. the way they did, when they did.\par \par \uc2 "She wouldn't be there if her grandfather, who was undocumented, hadn't come," Ramos said.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writer Jeri Clausing contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Follow Russell Contreras on Twitter at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://twitter.com/russcontreras"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://twitter.com/russcontreras}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110908e798001n1\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ATLANTA (AP) - Atlanta's safety net hospital on Wednesday reached an agreement with a private dialysis provider to continue treating a group of indigent patients, some of whom became critically ill after their life-sustaining treatment was cut off last week when a previous contract expired.\par \par \uc2 Grady Memorial Hospital will pay \uc2 Fresenius Medical Care\uc2  to treat the nearly two dozen patients, but the details were still being worked out and the amount paid and length of contract were not immediately available, said hospital spokesman Matt Gove. Regular dialysis treatment can resume at Fresenius clinics immediately, said company spokeswoman Jane Kramer.\par \par \uc2 Most of the patients are illegal immigrants, and their treatment has been in limbo several times since budget cuts forced Grady to close its outpatient dialysis clinic two years ago.\par \par \uc2 Patients with end-stage renal failure need regular dialysis two or three times a week to survive. After closing its clinic, Grady Memorial Hospital paid for treatment for about three dozen patients at private clinics through the end of last August. Under an agreement reached last year, three private clinics took on 13 patients as charity cases, and Grady agreed to pay Fresenius to treat the remaining patients.\par \par \uc2 After Grady's agreement with Fresenius expired Aug. 31, Fresenius turned away patients who arrived for care, telling them to go to Grady. The hospital, which has faced more budget cuts this year, has said it couldn't continue to shoulder the full cost for regular treatment.\par \par \uc2 Medicare, the federal health insurance program for people 65 and older, covers routine dialysis for U.S. citizens regardless of their age. But illegal immigrants are ineligible.\par \par \uc2 Hospitals can get reimbursed by Medicaid, the state-federal program that helps low-income people, when they provide emergency dialysis for illegal immigrants in life-or-death situations. But the reimbursement doesn't come close to covering what hospitals spend.\par \par \uc2 Bineet Kaur, one of the patients, was elated when she heard an agreement had been reached.\par \par \uc2 "That is just such great news. I'm so happy," she said by phone from Grady, where she was waiting for a heart test. After a week without dialysis, her heartbeat had become irregular and she had trouble breathing, she said.\par \par \uc2 Kaur came to the U.S. from India on a tourist visa in 2000 and applied for political asylum, saying she didn't feel safe in her country as a single woman living alone. Her asylum request was denied, making her an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . She was diagnosed with kidney failure in 2003 and told she needed dialysis, but she didn't get treatment because she had no insurance. After several years of extreme pain, she fainted while driving in early 2009, crashing her car into a pole and eventually ended up getting regular treatment at Grady.\par \par \uc2 She was among a group of patients turned away from Fresenius last Thursday and from Grady on Saturday. She went back to Grady Tuesday night and was deemed sick enough for emergency treatment. But she was so weak that she had to be hospitalized overnight before dialysis could begin Wednesday morning, she said.\par \par \uc2 The announcement of an agreement may have come too late for Reina Andrade. The 33-year-old was also turned away from Fresenius last week and from Grady on Saturday. She became so sick Sunday that she passed out and her sister took her to a suburban Atlanta emergency room, where she got treatment. With prospects for future treatment uncertain, she boarded a plane Wednesday morning for her native Honduras, her sister said.\par \par \uc2 Andrade, who had lived in the U.S. illegally for 11 years, has needed dialysis for the last five years.\par \par \uc2 Her sister, Marlen, said Wednesday before the agreement was reached that she didn't know whether Reina would be able to get the regular treatment she needs in Honduras because their mother lives far from a major city.\par \par \uc2 A doctor who gave her emergency treatment earlier this week told Reina that if she kept waiting to get treatment until she was in critical condition, she could only expect to live for about a year. The sisters and their mother decided that risk wasn't worth taking. Marlen Andrade did not immediately return a call Wednesday after the agreement had been reached.\par \par \uc2 5\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110907e7970021c\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc81}{\*\bkmkend toc81}\b \uc2 New lawmaker bucks rules, releases meeting records\b0\par\par\uc2 By JULIET WILLIAMS   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 1,299 \uc2 words\par \uc2 7 September 2011\par 16:15\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2011.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) - A second California lawmaker is bucking the state Legislature's policy that prohibits lawmakers from releasing their daily calendars and another is seeking permission to do so, suggesting that cracks are forming in the long-standing practice of denying access to those records.\par \par \uc2 After weeks of public pressure on legislative leaders to open the books on their office spending, The Associated Press and San Jose Mercury News repeated their joint request to Assembly lawmakers for copies of their meeting schedules. Opening such records would allow the public to see which lobbyists and other interests have access to lawmakers, especially during times such as this week when the Assembly and Senate are taking action on hundreds of bills.\par \par \uc2 Republican Assemblyman Tim Donnelly released copies of his meeting schedule from January through August, becoming the second state lawmaker to defy the Legislature's policy. Democratic Assemblyman Anthony Portantino of La Canada-Flintridge, who is in a feud with the Assembly speaker over office expenses, released his calendar for the first six months of 2011 to the AP last month.\par \par \uc2 "We need more transparency in government, not less. So to the extent that we are able to be transparent, we should," said Donnelly, of Twin Peaks, who represents foothill communities in Los Angeles and San Bernardino counties. "The people have a right to know how their money's spent; they have a right to know who we meet with."\par \par \uc2 Two Assembly Democrats, Nora Campos and Jim Beall, both of San Jose, also said for the first time they want to make their calendars public. They declined to release them, however, instead deferring to legislative leaders. Campos said she has asked the rules committee for permission to release her records.\par \par \uc2 The Legislature's secretive ways have been in the headlines for several weeks after the feud between Portantino and Assembly Speaker John Perez, D-Los Angeles, burst into the public sphere. When Portantino and media outlets were denied access to lawmakers' current office budgets, the Legislature faced widespread criticism about its refusal to release clear records showing how it spends public money.\par \par \uc2 In response, Perez announced that a task force would study legislative transparency and report back by January.\par \par \uc2 The task force's leader, Assemblywoman Nancy Skinner, D-Berkeley, suggested her review also would include lawmakers' daily schedules. She said she would examine the Assembly's "information and records practices," stretching beyond budget documents.\par \par \uc2 The AP and San Jose Mercury News, in conjunction with the California First Amendment Coalition, a nonprofit advocacy group, have joined forces this year in pressing California lawmakers for their daily meeting calendars in an effort to shed light on the interest groups that influence legislation.\par \par \uc2 Those requests have immediately been turned over to the rules committees in each house, which routinely reject them under the Legislative Open Records Act. The 1975 law approved by state lawmakers exempts them from the California Public Records Act, which covers other state agencies. The rules committees have cited legislative privilege, privacy and security concerns in denying the requests to see lawmakers' schedules.\par \par \uc2 After Portantino released his calendars last month, the Assembly Rules Committee's chief administrative officer, Jon Waldie, said it was Portantino's prerogative to release his calendars -- a possible change in policy from the committee's previous stance that lawmakers do not have such discretion.\par \par \uc2 Based on that statement, the news organizations again asked each of the 80 Assembly members to consider releasing their calendars.\par \par \uc2 The request was not made to the rules committee, but it responded nonetheless. In a Sept. 2 letter, the committee said keeping meeting schedules private "is grounded in the goals of encouraging public participation in government and facilitating effective decision-making."\par \par \uc2 In the letter, rules committee deputy administrator Lynda Roper cited a 1991 state Supreme Court ruling regarding access to the governor's calendars. The court denied access to several years of former Gov. George Deukmejian's calendars, ruling that revealing the details of every meeting he held might hamper the deliberative process.\par \par \uc2 Yet, Gov. Jerry Brown and his predecessor, as well as other statewide elected officials regularly release their schedules upon request. Several California open records experts said the 1991 case dealt specifically with executive privilege and does not apply to lawmakers.\par \par \uc2 "The Legislature is an entirely different animal. There's no public policy reason to protect from public view its deliberative process. On the contrary, you want to expose it," said Peter Scheer, director of the California First Amendment Coalition. "Legislatures are supposed to deliberate openly. That's why we have votes."\par \par \uc2 First Amendment expert Terry Francke noted that the letter references the need for privacy -- for lawmakers, not the public. He said the people with the most access to elected officials, lobbyists, are not regular citizens who need protection.\par \par \uc2 "Lobbyists are well-paid professionals, not shrinking violets. Their names, employers and faces are on the public record, as are the bills they have spent any considerable time working on," Francke, who is general counsel to the open records group Californians Aware, told the Mercury News.\par \par \uc2 At least one lawmaker sought to release her calendars. In a letter to the AP and Mercury News, Campos said she provided weekly access to her meeting calendar as a former member of the San Jose City Council. Campos said she asked Waldie for permission to release her calendar but was denied.\par \par \uc2 "I am fully supportive of providing public access to my calendar," she wrote.\par \par \uc2 It's a departure for Campos, who earlier this year told the Mercury News she would not reveal her calendar due to privacy concerns. Campos and Beall, her fellow Assembly member from San Jose, said they will recommend to the task force that calendars be made public.\par \par \uc2 In the state Senate, which has similarly rejected all requests for lawmakers' calendars, a spokesman for Senate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg, D-Sacramento, said there is also increasing attention to transparency issues.\par \par \uc2 The focus is due "in no small part due to your efforts," and has led to further debate in the Senate Rules Committee, spokesman Nathan Barankin told the Mercury News. But he added, "Whether these things result in a change in policy, I can't predict."\par \par \uc2 Barankin said Senate officials worry that releasing details of lawmakers' meetings with lobbyists could give "sophisticated observers" information they could use as leverage in their own lobbying strategies, making special interests even more powerful in the state Capitol.\par \par \uc2 Lawmakers are debating and negotiating hundreds of bills in the final weeks of the legislative session, everything from expanding college aid to \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students to a bill that would clear some of the hurdles for an NFL stadium in downtown Los Angeles.\par \par \uc2 For Donnelly, that means dozens of meetings and public events. His calendars show a meeting with a lobbyist for community colleges to discuss legislation that would limit public employee pensions and another with the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association to talk about a proposal to prohibit any ballot initiatives that would cost state or local governments more than $5 million. Donnelly voted against the legislation.\par \par \uc2 Donnelly's weekly Capitol Bible Study meetings also are on the calendar, as are regular appearances at tea party events around the state and even last month's annual trap shoot with fellow members of the "outdoor sporting caucus."\par \par \uc2 The freshman lawmaker said the schedules offer only a glimpse of his hundreds of interactions in the state Capitol, since many meetings are unscheduled. He said he tries to meet with anyone who wants to see him, whether they have an appointment or not.\par \par \uc2 "All day long, people walk the hallways, they knock on doors, they stop and say `Can we talk to you?'" Donnelly said.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110907e797001xs\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc83}{\*\bkmkend toc83}\b \uc2 Avakian stands liberal ground on war, health care\b0\par\par\uc2 By JONATHAN J. COOPER   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 1,017 \uc2 words\par \uc2 3 September 2011\par 13:16\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2011.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) - When Labor Commissioner Brad Avakian decided to run for Congress, he planned to take on a seven-term incumbent weakened by scandal in the 2012 election.\par \par \uc2 A lot changed in four months.\par \par \uc2 The incumbent, former Rep. David Wu, has resigned amid allegations that he made an unwanted sexual advance toward a young woman in California. So Avakian is now sprinting toward a special primary election that's little more than two months away. His main opponent isn't a battered Wu, but rather the state senator who replaced him in the Legislature three years ago.\par \par \uc2 As he courts Democratic primary voters to help win the Nov. 8 special election, Avakian is trumpeting solidly liberal positions on a number of issues -- ideas that could play well in the Democrat-dominated Northwest Oregon district, even if they're less popular in a Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives. Avakian wants, for instance, to immediately end the war in Afghanistan and use the money to hire many of the 14 million out-of-work Americans to build new bridges, and upgrade airports and railways.\par \par \uc2 "I would take every available aircraft carrier we have, I would send them to the Middle East, I would load up our troops immediately and bring them home," Avakian told The Associated Press in a recent interview.\par \par \uc2 His tough talk is a repudiation of President Barack Obama's strategy, which calls for bringing home the troops by the end of 2014, and a nod to liberals who are highly skeptical of U.S. involvement in Afghanistan. His Democratic opponents -- state Sen. Suzanne Bonamici of Portland and state Rep. Brad Witt of Clatskanie -- have also said the Obama should bring the troops home sooner, though not necessarily immediately.\par \par \uc2 Avakian said he hasn't seen enough progress in Afghanistan to justify endangering troops any longer, and he said he'd be willing to vote against funding for the conflict.\par \par \uc2 With Wu out of office, his shadow has all but disappeared from the race to replace him. The candidates, for the most part, are focused on each other. Avakian points out he was the first to take on Wu months before the congressman resigned on Aug. 3.\par \par \uc2 "I think you'd find them pretty close ideologically," said Len Bergstein, a Democratic lobbyist and former political consultant not affiliated with any of the candidates. "So in a lot of ways they're going to be talking about personality styles."\par \par \uc2 Now that he has two new opponents, though, Avakian has a unique challenge to differentiate himself from Witt -- another Democrat named Brad courting support and money from unions. Bonamici calls her opponents "The Brads," and she stands to benefit if they appeal to the same constituency and split the vote.\par \par \uc2 Avakian, 50, is a lawyer who represented workers in employment discrimination cases. He said the experience showed him the importance of a job -- for money, to be sure, but also for a person's psyche and sense of self-worth.\par \par \uc2 Avakian said he wants to help people find jobs by focusing on workforce training, reviving shop classes in middle and high schools and finding a way to get banks to lend more money so businesses have confidence in their cash flow. He also wants to reduce regulations on credit unions in hopes that they'd lend more to small businesses and compete with larger banks.\par \par \uc2 He isn't much of a fan of the federal health care overhaul. Not that he agrees with the law's conservative critics who say it's socialist or unconstitutional. He thinks it didn't go far enough, and he'd prefer an option for government-run health care for people who choose it. Eventually, he said, he'd like to see a single-payer health care system.\par \par \uc2 Still, he said he would've voted for the federal health overhaul because it gave health coverage to people who were uninsured.\par \par \uc2 Avakian got his start in politics in 1998 with an unsuccessful bid to unseat Republican Sen. Tom Hartung, a Washington County stalwart who had represented the region for decades. Avakian lost, but not by much, and he got some attention from insiders for his fundraising prowess and a commitment to consistently pounding the pavement in his district. He tried again four years later, this time for a House seat, and he won.\par \par \uc2 In his last year in the Legislature, Avakian worked on an expansion of the bottle bill and was credited with muscling through a measure that requires Oregon's largest utilities to draw 25 percent of their electricity from renewable resources by 2025.\par \par \uc2 In 2008, Avakian was one of four Democrats running for secretary of state. When Labor Commissioner Dan Gardner resigned to take a job in the nation's capital, then-Gov. Ted Kulongoski appointed Avakian to the post. He was elected statewide later that year, and his term expires next year.\par \par \uc2 As commissioner at the Bureau of Labor and Industries, which is responsible for enforcing antidiscrimination and employment laws, Avakian says he has focused on improving relations with businesses and simplifying bureaucratic processes.\par \par \uc2 Avakian opposes restrictions on abortion and supports the legalization of gay marriage. He says illegal immigrants now in the United States should be allowed to legalize their status, with a penalty of some sort, and the country needs to acknowledge that significant industries rely on \uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2  labor.\par \par \uc2 "I wish that more people in America valued citizenship like I think we used to, and I wish that more immigrants that were coming here saw a pathway to citizenship and wanted it, because I think it's a valuable thing," Avakian said.\par \par \uc2 He lives in Beaverton with his wife, Debbie, a human resources administrator. They have two children in college, ages 20 and 18.\par \par \uc2 The winner of the Democratic primary will most likely face Republican Rob Cornilles in a Jan. 31 general election to determine who will finish out Wu's term. The regular general election will be held Nov. 6, 2012.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110903e793001j6\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 HOUSTON (AP) - A federal jury found a Department of Homeland Security pilot not guilty Friday of lying about his alleged role in the drowning of a would-be \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  swimming across the Rio Grande toward Texas, but couldn't reach a verdict on three other similar counts.\par \par \uc2 Jurors acquitted James Peters on one count of making false statements to federal investigators looking into the 2005 drowning death of Carlos Delgadillo Martinez. A judge declared a mistrial on the three other counts of the same charge.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors accused Peters, 41, of lying about flying his helicopter low in an attempt to force Delgadillo and another person back to Mexico. Officials say the force of the turbulence from the helicopter's rotor blades made Delgadillo lose his grip on an inner tube.\par \par \uc2 But defense attorneys tried to create doubt in the jurors' minds by suggesting that surveillance video prosecutors said showed Peters flying over Delgadillo and the other person was not clear, that it didn't indicate how far above the men the aircraft actually was and that it presented no proof anyone drowned.\par \par \uc2 The jury indicated several times during its deliberations, which began Wednesday, that it couldn't reach a unanimous verdict on all four counts. On Friday, U.S. District Judge Sim Lake resisted prosecutors' efforts to have jurors continue working, saying they had deliberated extensively.\par \par \uc2 Peters, who had faced up to five years in prison if convicted, cried after the judge read the verdict. After the jury left the courtroom, he hugged his wife and three friends, including two other Homeland Security pilots.\par \par \uc2 "He's relieved," said Thomas Berg, one of Peters' attorneys. "He's hoping the government will dismiss the other counts and this nightmare can be over."\par \par \uc2 Federal prosecutors said they respected the jury's verdict and told Lake they would let him know by late next week if they planned to retry Peters on the three undecided counts or drop those charges.\par \par \uc2 "It brings us no joy to prosecute police officers but when we have evidence of police misconduct, we have no choice but to go forward with the prosecution," said prosecutor Ruben Perez.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors had argued that surveillance video clearly showed Peters flew his helicopter over the immigrants, getting as close as 100 feet to an international bridge in Laredo, in an attempt to drive them back to Mexico as they tried crossing into the United States on Dec. 14, 2005. Delgadillo's body was found later that day.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutor Joseph Magliolo said Peters used the helicopter aggressively to force the immigrants back.\par \par \uc2 "It was a case that had to be tried," Magliolo said after the verdict.\par \par \uc2 Berg said Peters should never have been indicted because there was no proof he flew too close to the bridge or that he was lying when he told investigators he didn't recall flying over any individuals near the bridge that day.\par \par \uc2 Berg also said there was no proof of anyone drowning on the video and that additional doubt about whether Peters had anything to do with the drowning was created by testimony from a Border Patrol agent who said at the trial that after the helicopter left, he saw two men get out of the water on the Mexican side of the river.\par \par \uc2 "The jury didn't have enough evidence to make a decision," Berg said. "The jury did its job."\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors acknowledged the border agent's testimony and said it was hard to tell from the video if the inner tube that Delgadillo was holding flipped over. It was unclear if the individuals whom the agent saw getting out of the river were the same ones encountered by the helicopter.\par \par \uc2 Peters, who was suspended without pay after being indicted in January, is currently stationed in Maine. He has worked for Homeland Security since 1997, becoming a helicopter pilot in 2003.\par \par \uc2 5\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110902e792000s1\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) - A New Mexico judge blocked Republican Gov. Susana Martinez's administration Wednesday from requiring tens of thousands of immigrants to recertify their driver's licenses and verify whether they continue to live in the state.\par \par \uc2 Martinez last month announced the residency verification plan, which represents the administration's latest effort to focus attention on the state's politically charged license policy, which the governor contends poses a security risk.\par \par \uc2 New Mexico is one of three states -- the others are Washington and Utah -- where an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  can get a driver's license because no proof of citizenship is required.\par \par \uc2 Under the residency verification plan, New Mexico sent notices to people that they must schedule an in-person appointment and bring documents, such as a utility bill or lease agreement, to prove they live in the state. The administration plans to cancel licenses of people who no longer are New Mexico residents.\par \par \uc2 Martinez wants the Legislature to repeal New Mexico's license policy by requiring people to have a Social Security number, which is not available to someone living in the country illegally, to obtain a driver's license. The governor's proposal failed in the Legislature earlier this year but she's renewing her push when lawmakers return to work next week in a special session.\par \par \uc2 District Court Judge Sarah Singleton on Wednesday issued an order temporarily halting the license residency verification program while it's being challenged in court.\par \par \uc2 A lawsuit was filed last week by the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund against the administration's plan to check a random sample of 10,000 license holders who are foreign nationals.\par \par \uc2 The lawsuit contends that the license certification program is illegal because it discriminates against one segment of the population -- foreign nationals. The suit also contends the governor doesn't have the power, without approval from the Legislature, to in effect require certain people to reapply for a driver's license.\par \par \uc2 David Urias, an Albuquerque lawyer helping to handle the case, said the judge's ruling was important "because it protects the rights of the people who are being ordered by the MVD to come before it and prove their identity and residency, even though the MVD has absolutely no reason to believe that any of these particular individuals did anything wrong."\par \par \uc2 Scott Darnell, a spokesman for the governor, said the judge's order was "fairly standard as the court examines the residency certification program."\par \par \uc2 "In the absence of the Legislature acting to put an end to the program that provides driver's licenses to illegal immigrants, the governor has the responsibility to identify and attempt to curb the dangerous fraud and identity theft that is inherent in it," Darnell said in a statement.\par \par \uc2 Wednesday was the last day of regularly scheduled appointments for residency certification. Any future appointments, according to the administration, would have been for people who had not yet complied or when the state lacked a forwarding address after the initial notice couldn't be delivered.\par \par \uc2 Of the 10,000 letters sent out, more than 30 percent have been returned as undeliverable for some reason.\par \par \uc2 The lawsuit was brought on behalf of several Democratic lawmakers and a Hispanic woman -- a foreign national from Mexico who has been living legally in the state for more than a decade.\par \par \uc2 Marcela Diaz of Somos Un Pueblo Unido, an immigrant rights group, said in a statement that the license verification program "is nothing more than a bullying tactic that intimidates and threatens people for no reason."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Follow Barry Massey on Twitter at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://twitter.com/bmasseyAP"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://twitter.com/bmasseyAP}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110831e78v002o5\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) - The state Senate on Wednesday approved the second half of contentious legislation that would allow students who are illegal immigrants to apply for state-funded scholarships and financial aid.\par \par \uc2 The Senate approved AB131, also known as the California Dream Act, with a 22-11 vote, leaving it just one step away from the governor's desk.\par \par \uc2 The state Assembly must consider changes to the bill it previously passed before it can go to Gov. Jerry Brown.\par \par \uc2 "These students are valedictorians, they're class presidents, and they're all-star athletes. They are the future of California," said Sen. Ron Calderon, D-Monterey Park, who carried the bill in the Senate.\par \par \uc2 The bill is part of a legislative package by Assemblyman Gil Cedillo, D-Los Angeles. Last month, Brown, a Democrat, signed a separate bill by Cedillo approving private scholarships and loans for \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students. AB131 would make those students eligible for state-funded financial aid.\par \par \uc2 Critics say allowing access to those state resources encourages illegal immigration. Supporters counter that the students, many of whom were brought to the United States as young children, shouldn't be punished for their parents' actions.\par \par \uc2 Sen. Doug La Malfa, R-Willows, opposed the bill Wednesday. He read a letter from a constituent who said his daughter's California education grant was recently cut. He said passing a law such as this would be like rubbing salt in his wound.\par \par \uc2 Cedillo's legislative package differs from the federal Dream Act, a proposal that would create a path to citizenship for those who are brought to the country illegally as children.\par \par \uc2 Under the bill approved Wednesday, \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students would have to meet the same requirements as others but only would qualify for financial aid that remains after legal residents apply.\par \par \uc2 "They basically receive the leftovers," Calderon said.\par \par \uc2 The state Assembly approved a similar bill Wednesday by Assemblyman Ricardo Lara, D-Bell Gardens, on a 49-23 vote and sent it to the governor's desk.\par \par \uc2 The approval came after a heated debate on AB844, which would allow \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  college students to hold student government office and receive any grants, scholarships or other assistance that come with the jobs.\par \par \uc2 Assemblyman Allan Mansoor, R-Costa Mesa, called the bill just one more attempt by Democrats to undermine immigration laws.\par \par \uc2 "It's a slap in the face to people who followed the rules, people like my parents," Mansoor said.\par \par \uc2 Lara's legislation was sparked by the story of Pedro Ramirez, the former student body president at California State University, Fresno, who acknowledged last year while in office that he was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . Ramirez had declined the $9,000 stipend to which he was entitled because he did not want to lie on employment papers.\par \par \uc2 Ramirez said his parents brought him to the U.S. when he was 3 and he only learned he was not a citizen when he began applying to colleges.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writers Sheila V.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 BOSTON (AP) - President Barack Obama's uncle, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  charged with drunken driving last week, was ordered by an immigration judge to leave the country almost two decades ago, a federal official said Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 The official said a deportation order was issued against Onyango Obama in 1992. The official spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to release details on the case.\par \par \uc2 Obama, who's from Kenya, is the half-brother of the president's late father. He has pleaded not guilty to operating under the influence of alcohol and is being held on an immigration detainer.\par \par \uc2 An immigration detainer, used by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to identify people in jail or prison who could be deported, is a request to another law enforcement agency to notify ICE before releasing the person from custody so ICE can arrange to take over custody.\par \par \uc2 Obama's immigration attorney, Margaret Wong, of Cleveland, declined to comment on his case or on how long he has been living in the U.S. illegally.\par \par \uc2 The White House also has declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 Obama, 67, was arrested last week in Framingham, where he has lived for years, about 20 miles west of Boston. He had made a rolling stop at a stop sign and nearly caused a police cruiser to strike his sport utility vehicle, police said. After being booked at a police station, he was asked whether he wanted to make a telephone call to arrange for bail, they said.\par \par \uc2 "I think I will call the White House," he said, according to a report written by Framingham police.\par \par \uc2 He is the second Obama family member to be discovered living illegally in the United States. His sister Zeituni Onyango, the president's aunt, made headlines last year when she won the right to stay in the United States after an earlier deportation order.\par \par \uc2 Onyango, of Boston, came to the United States from Kenya in 2000 and was denied asylum by an immigration judge in 2004. She stayed in the country illegally and was granted asylum last year by a judge who found she could be a target in Kenya for those who oppose the United States and the president and for members of the Kenyan government.\par \par \uc2 Obama's traffic arrest has enflamed the debate over illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 "It demonstrates what a mockery our immigration law has become," said Ira Mehlman, a spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, a national group that calls for stricter immigration laws. "Once immigrants get here, they can beat the system, they can ignore deportation orders. They can drag things out endlessly on appeal."\par \par \uc2 Obama has held a Massachusetts driver's license since at least 1992, according to the earliest electronic records kept by the state Registry of Motor Vehicles, spokesman Richard Nangle said.\par \par \uc2 "He had a Social Security number and proof of residence," Nangle said. "He did everything he needed to do by us."\par \par \uc2 Before Obama's arrest last week, he had a clear driving record, Nangle said.\par \par \uc2 The Social Security Administration did not respond to a telephone call seeking comment on Obama's case Wednesday. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 The Executive Office for Immigration Review, which oversees immigration courts, couldn't release details of Obama's case without having a signed privacy waiver from him or his attorney, spokeswoman Lauren Alder Reid said.\par \par \uc2 Boston immigration lawyer Anthony Drago said he didn't know the circumstances of Obama's case, but he said if Obama had applied for asylum he would've been eligible to apply for work authorization. If he then became legally authorized to work in the United States, Drago said, he would be eligible for a Social Security number.\par \par \uc2 Drago said some immigrants ignore deportation orders. But he said some feel they have no choice but to remain in the United States.\par \par \uc2 "Other people are just so petrified of leaving the United States and returning to a country where they feel their life is going to be in danger -- I wouldn't call that ignoring it," Drago said. "I would call that just not being able to leave."\par \par \uc2 The president, in his memoir "Dreams from My Father," refers to an Uncle Omar, who matches Obama's background and has the same date of birth.\par \par \uc2 The book is about the president retracing his roots and his 1988 trip to Kenya. In it, the president mentions photographs of his Uncle Omar, "the uncle who had left for America twenty-five years ago and had never come back." He also discusses a Kenyan expression about getting lost, meaning to not see someone in a while or to move away and stop communicating -- "like our Uncle Omar, in Boston."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110831e78v0026n\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 HOUSTON (AP) - A federal jury on Wednesday began deliberating the fate of a Department of Homeland Security pilot who is accused by prosecutors of lying about whether he flew his helicopter low over two would-be illegal immigrants in the Rio Grande in South Texas before one of the men drowned.\par \par \uc2 During closing arguments, prosecutors told jurors that surveillance video clearly shows James Peters flew his helicopter over the immigrants, getting as close as 100 feet to an international bridge in Laredo, in an attempt to drive them back to Mexico as they tried crossing into the United States on Dec. 14, 2005.\par \par \uc2 "Peters decides to try to push them back, force them back," said prosecutor Joseph Magliolo. "He takes progressively more aggressive action to the folks in the water."\par \par \uc2 Officials say turbulence from the helicopter's rotor blades made Carlos Delgadillo Martinez lose his grip on an inner tube. His body was found later that day.\par \par \uc2 Jurors deliberated for about five hours Wednesday. The jury was to resume its deliberations Thursday.\par \par \uc2 Peters was indicted on four counts of making false statements to investigators looking into the drowning death. He faces up to five years in prison if convicted. His trial began Monday afternoon with testimony in the case lasting just over a day.\par \par \uc2 But lawyers for Peters, 41, told jurors that prosecutors presented flimsy evidence and that the video doesn't clearly show how far above the men the helicopter actually flew.\par \par \uc2 Thomas Berg, one of Peters' attorneys, told jurors that the pilot didn't lie to investigators when asked if he encountered illegal immigrants that day and whether he flew close to the bridge. Berg said Peters believed he did not fly too close to the bridge and didn't recall flying over any individuals in the river that day.\par \par \uc2 "The dangerous work (pilots like Peters) do in trying to secure our border is to protect you," Berg told jurors. "He was doing his job that day."\par \par \uc2 Berg also said there's no proof of anyone drowning on the video.\par \par \uc2 "This is not a case about killing somebody in a river," he said. "You don't see anybody die in this video. You don't know how that man drowned."\par \par \uc2 Berg said a Border Patrol agent testified that after the helicopter left, he saw two men get out of the water on the Mexican side of the river. Magliolo acknowledged in his closing statements that the Border Patrol agent said this and that from the video it can be hard to tell whether the inner tube that Delgadillo was holding flipped over. It's unclear if the individuals whom the agent saw getting out of the river were the same ones encountered by the helicopter.\par \par \uc2 But "Peters had contact with the (illegal immigrants) at the bridge. The video shows that," Magliolo said.\par \par \uc2 Peters, who is currently stationed in Maine, has worked for Homeland Security since 1997, becoming a helicopter pilot in 2003.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110831e78v001ly\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 HOUSTON (AP) - A Department of Homeland Security pilot lied about using his helicopter in 2005 to force two would-be illegal immigrants back into Mexico as they attempted to cross the Rio Grande on inner tubes, an action that resulted in the drowning of one of the individuals, a federal prosecutor told jurors on Monday.\par \par \uc2 James Peters faces four counts of making false statements to investigators looking into the death of Carlos Delgadillo Martinez, a Mexican national.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors told jurors during opening statements in Peters' trial that the 41-year-old lied about taking part in a Dec. 14, 2005 incident near a bridge in Laredo, Texas. They accuse Peters of flying his helicopter low over the Rio Grande in an attempt to force Delgadillo and another person, who authorities say were trying to illegally cross into the U.S., back to Mexico.\par \par \uc2 "He flew over them, hovered over them," said prosecutor Ruben Perez.\par \par \uc2 Investigators say the force of the turbulence from the low flying helicopter's rotor made Delgadillo lose his grip on an inner tube. His body was found later that day near the bridge.\par \par \uc2 Perez said a video from a Border Patrol pole camera will show that Peters' helicopter flew below the bridge and hovered over the water on the day of the drowning.\par \par \uc2 According to the indictment, internal radio transmissions indicate Peters told a Border Patrol agent he was going to try to make the individuals "go back."\par \par \uc2 "He lied and we are going to prove that to you," Perez said.\par \par \uc2 But Thomas Berg, Peters' attorney, told jurors his client didn't lie to investigators but that they misunderstood him when he was initially questioned about the incident a month after it happened. Berg said Peters had to go back and review records about whether he had flown near the bridge on that day.\par \par \uc2 Berg said that on the day of the drowning, Peters responded to a call from Border Patrol agents who were dealing with smugglers near the bridge in Laredo.\par \par \uc2 "It appeared people were in the water. What happened to them after that, (Peters) doesn't know because he left," Berg said.\par \par \uc2 Berg said Peters' helicopter is designed to fly low to the ground but that the aircraft was never closer than 100 feet to the bridge on the day of the drowning.\par \par \uc2 Berg said responding to such calls was routine for Peters.\par \par \uc2 "Why would he be lying about an incident if there was nothing significant about it?" he said.\par \par \uc2 Peters, who was indicted in January, has pleaded not guilty and faces up to five years in prison if convicted.\par \par \uc2 Peters, who is currently stationed in Maine, has worked for Homeland Security since 1997, becoming a helicopter pilot in 2003.\par \par \uc2 The trial was expected to last several days.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110830e78u000bp\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

(AP) -- A jury recommended Monday that a Kansas man be sentenced to death for killing four family members in November 2009.\par \par \uc2 The jury returned its recommendation after hearing more testimony about 48-year-old James Kraig Kahler and his state of mind at the time of the fatal shootings. The judge -- who is not bound the recommendation -- set sentencing for Oct. 11 in Osage County District Court.\par \par \uc2 Kahler was convicted Thursday of four counts of capital murder in the killings of 44-year-old Karen Kahler; her grandmother, Dorothy Wight, 89; and the Kahlers' daughters, Emily, 18, and Lauren, 16. The Kahlers' son, Sean, now 12, was not threatened during the rampage and testified at trial that he saw his father shoot his mother.\par \par \uc2 The victims' family members read a short statement outside the courthouse after the verdict, saying all relatives "still have a lot of healing to do" and that the trial didn't restore their relatives' lives.\par \par \uc2 "For the past year and a half, we've had a dark cloud around us that we associated with this trial," said Lynn Denton, Karen Kahler's sister. "Now that it's over, the cloud is still there.\par \par \uc2 "The cloud wasn't about the trial, it is about our loss."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Grocery owner pleads guilty to food stamp scheme\par \par \uc2 WICHITA, Kan. (AP) -- A Wichita grocery store owner admitted Monday to conspiring to trade cash for his customers' food stamps at a profit and giving a cut to a man who scoured homeless shelters for people willing to sell their government benefits.\par \par \uc2 Ahmed Ajami Al-Maleki, the owner of Kansas Food Market, repeatedly answered "I am guilty" to charges of conspiracy, wire fraud and food stamp fraud.\par \par \uc2 U.S. District Judge J. Thomas Marten set sentencing for Nov. 21. He faces up to 20 years in prison, although he is likely to get far less, if any, prison time under federal sentencing guidelines. He also faces potential fines and likely restitution.\par \par \uc2 "Abuse of important federal programs such as food stamps will not be tolerated," U.S. Attorney Barry Grissom said in a news release. "There are those who need access to these programs, and when a handful of people steal from them, it hurts those in need and it hurts all of us."\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors indicted Al-Maleki, 41, for fraudulently making $130,000 in some 750 transactions involving at least 100 food stamp recipients.\par \par \uc2 In a deal for his guilty plea, the government agreed to dismiss other counts in the food stamp case as well as a separate indictment accusing him of knowingly hiring an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . Prosecutors agreed to recommend a sentence at the low end of federal sentencing guidelines.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Hoenig addresses Kan. officials on economy\par \par \uc2 TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) -- The president of the Federal Reserve bank in Kansas City, Mo., said Monday the United States must make significant reforms, including reviving the manufacturing sector, in order to restore confidence in the economy.\par \par \uc2 Thomas H. Hoenig made his remarks to members of Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback's administration, bankers and legislators in Topeka.\par \par \uc2 Hoenig said decades of lost manufacturing jobs, rising debt and long-term obligations have put the nation's economy and future at risk. He said the United States needs to create a climate to promote manufacturing more goods that the world demands.\par \par \uc2 "You don't create jobs, you create an environment to create jobs," Hoenig said.\par \par \uc2 He said the United States had become too dependent on consumer spending to drive growth, but that has slowed as consumer debt increases and savings rates decline to near zero, eliminating any ability to invest capital.\par \par \uc2 Hoenig said Washington policies would not revive the economy alone, such as providing short-term stimulus packages or adjusting monetary policies with increased regulations.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 2011 Indian Peace Treaty pageant might be last\par \par \uc2 MEDICINE LODGE, Kan. (AP) -- A September tradition in southern Kansas that celebrates 300 years of the state's history might become history itself after this year's event because of a lack of money and volunteers, organizers said.\par \par \uc2 The Medicine Lodge Indian Peace Treaty Pageant has drawn thousands of people to the south central town where the pageant has been held every three to five years since it began in 1927.\par \par \uc2 But it requires help from nearly all the town's 2,300 residents and interest in participating has dropped in recent years, The Wichita Eagle reported ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://bit.ly/n09Mgphttp://bit.ly/n09Mgp"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://bit.ly/n09Mgphttp://bit.ly/n09Mgp}}}\uc2  ) Monday.\par \par \uc2 The pageant, held in a natural amphitheater, typically draws between 10,000 and 15,000 visitors from Kansas and across the nation. This year's will be the 23rd pageant.\par \par \uc2 The focus is a re-enactment of the signing of an 1867 treaty that was supposed to make traveling safer for those heading to frontier settlements in the West. It also one of the largest gatherings of Plains Indians -- 15,000 Kiowa, Comanche, Arapaho, Apache and Cheyenne.\par \par \uc2 "It is with great sadness that possibly this will be our last one," wrote Robert Larson, one of the pageant's board members, in an email to The Eagle. "It has become difficult to get community support and financial assistance to continue this wonderful event, as you probably know once you lose something like this it is almost impossible for a small community to get it back."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Kan. crops continue decline amid heat, dry weather\par \par \uc2 WICHITA, Kan. (AP) -- A new report says the condition of Kansas farm crops declined slightly over the past week amid heat and dry weather.\par \par \uc2 Kansas Agricultural Statistics Service, in its report Monday, says about 8 percent of the state's corn crop has now been harvested. The agency says 46 percent of the corn is rated in poor to very poor condition, with 27 percent rated fair, 22 percent good and 5 percent in excellent condition.\par \par \uc2 Forty-four percent of the sorghum crop and 42 percent of the soybean crop were rated in poor to very poor condition.\par \par \uc2 Hay and forage supplies were running about 53 percent short to very short statewide. Concern is also growing for stock ponds as water levels continue to fall.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Kansas worker dies in railroad accident\par \par \uc2 ABILENE, Kan.

Railroad spokesman Mark Davis says crossing arms are supposed to come down across streets when the trucks are on the tracks. He says he doesn't know why the arms didn't go down.\par \par \uc2 A woman driving the car was hospitalized by the patrol says her injuries weren't serious.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 1 rescued after Fort Leavenworth wall collapse\par \par \uc2 FORT LEAVENWORTH, Kan. (AP) -- One person has been rescued after spending more than an hour trapped underneath a collapsed wall at Fort Leavenworth in northeast Kansas.\par \par \uc2 Fort Leavenworth spokeswoman Rebecca Steed says the contractor was air evacuated for treatment after he was rescued Monday morning from a building that was being renovated. The name of the contractor wasn't immediately released.\par \par \uc2 The construction company has accounted for all the other people working in the building.\par \par \uc2 It's unclear what caused the wall to collapse.\par \par \uc2 Steed says the building was inside the walls of the old military prison at Fort Leavenworth. Since the old prison has been torn down, some of the older buildings that surrounded it are being renovated. They hold everything from offices to a restaurant.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110830e78u0014l\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) - A federal judge temporarily blocked enforcement of Alabama's new law cracking down on illegal immigration, ruling Monday that she needed more time to decide whether the law opposed by the Obama administration, church leaders and immigrant-rights groups is constitutional.\par \par \uc2 The brief order by U.S. District Judge Sharon L. Blackburn means the law -- which opponents and supporters alike have called the toughest in the nation -- won't take effect as scheduled on Thursday. The ruling was cheered both by Republican leaders who were pleased the judge didn't gut the law and by opponents who compare it to old Jim Crow-era statutes against racial integration.\par \par \uc2 Blackburn didn't address whether the law is constitutional, and she could still let all or parts of the law take effect later. Instead, she said she needed more time to consider lawsuits filed by the Justice Department, private groups and individuals that claim the state is overstepping its bounds.\par \par \uc2 The judge said she will issue a longer ruling by Sept. 28, and her temporary order will remain in effect until the day after. She heard arguments from the Justice Department and others during a daylong hearing last week.\par \par \uc2 Similar laws have been passed in Arizona, Utah, Indiana and Georgia. Federal judges already have blocked all or parts of the laws in those states.\par \par \uc2 Among other things, the law would require schools to verify the citizenship status of students, but it wouldn't prevent illegal immigrants from attending public schools.\par \par \uc2 The law also would make it a crime to knowingly assist an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  by providing them a ride, a job, a place to live or most anything else -- a section that church leaders fear would hamper public assistance ministries. It also would allow police to jail suspected illegal immigrants during traffic stops.\par \par \uc2 Finding a way to curtail public spending that benefits illegal immigrants has been a pet project of Alabama conservatives for years. Census figures released earlier this year show the state's Hispanic population more than doubled over a decade to 185,602 last year, and supporters of the law contend many of them are in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 Isabel Rubio, executive director of the Hispanic Interest Coalition of Alabama, which is among the groups that sued over the law, hopes Blackburn will block it entirely but was happy with the temporary reprieve.\par \par \uc2 "We are pleased that Judge Blackburn is taking more time to study the case," she said.\par \par \uc2 Republican Gov. Robert Bentley said he would continue to defend the law, and GOP leaders in the House and Senate praised Blackburn -- a Republican appointee -- for taking time to fully consider the law.\par \par \uc2 "We must remember that today's ruling is simply the first round in what promises to be a long judicial fight over Alabama's right to protect its borders," said House Majority Leader Micky Hammon of Decatur. "To put it in sports terms, it is the first half-inning of the first game of a seven-game World Series."\par \par \uc2 While the Obama administration contends the state law conflicts with federal immigration law, state Sen. Scott Beason, R-Gardendale, contends the federal government isn't doing its job enforcing immigration laws. Beason said that he spent years researching immigration law to help write the 70-plus page law, and that it's unrealistic to expect a judge to go through it all in a few days.\par \par \uc2 "You just can't do that," he said.\par \par \uc2 5\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110829e78t0021j\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WICHITA, Kan. (AP) - A Wichita grocery store owner admitted Monday to conspiring to trade cash for his customers' food stamps at a profit and giving a cut to a man who scoured homeless shelters for people willing to sell their government benefits.\par \par \uc2 Ahmed Ajami Al-Maleki, the owner of Kansas Food Market, repeatedly answered "I am guilty" to charges of conspiracy, wire fraud and food stamp fraud.\par \par \uc2 U.S. District Judge J. Thomas Marten set sentencing for Nov. 21. He faces up to 20 years in prison, although he is likely to get far less, if any, prison time under federal sentencing guidelines. He also faces potential fines and likely restitution.\par \par \uc2 "Abuse of important federal programs such as food stamps will not be tolerated," U.S. Attorney Barry Grissom said in a news release. "There are those who need access to these programs, and when a handful of people steal from them, it hurts those in need and it hurts all of us."\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors indicted Al-Maleki, 41, for fraudulently making $130,000 in some 750 transactions involving at least 100 food stamp recipients.\par \par \uc2 In a deal for his guilty plea, the government agreed to dismiss other counts in the food stamp case as well as a separate indictment accusing him of knowingly hiring an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . Prosecutors agreed to recommend a sentence at the low end of federal sentencing guidelines.\par \par \uc2 Al-Maleki admitted in his plea agreement that between July and December of last year, he intentionally entered into an agreement with Wally Mikhael Gaggo and others to defraud the Department of Agriculture by giving cash to recipients of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, commonly known as food stamps.\par \par \uc2 Indictments filed in March accuse 13 people in a scheme that defrauded the government out of more than $580,000. The two food stamp-related indictments came after months of investigations involving undercover informants, surveillance of the stores and computerized detection systems. Most have pleaded guilty.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors said the two small stores -- the Kansas Food Market and the Alnoor Grocery and Biryani House -- typically paid people half of the value of their benefits and pocketed the difference. Gaggo, the runner who was charged in both indictments, has pleaded guilty and faces sentencing Oct. 17.\par \par \uc2 The owners of Alnoor Grocery and Biryani House face trial in October.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110829e78t0016h\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 HOUSTON (AP) - A Department of Homeland Security pilot lied about using his helicopter in 2005 to force two would-be illegal immigrants back into Mexico as they attempted to cross the Rio Grande on inner tubes, an action that resulted in the drowning of one of the individuals, a federal prosecutor told jurors on Monday.\par \par \uc2 James Peters faces four counts of making false statements to investigators looking into the death of Carlos Delgadillo Martinez, a Mexican national.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors told jurors during opening statements in Peters' trial that the 41-year-old lied about taking part in a Dec. 14, 2005 incident near a bridge in Laredo, Texas. They accuse Peters of flying his helicopter low over the Rio Grande in an attempt to force Delgadillo and another person, who authorities say were trying to illegally cross into the U.S., back to Mexico.\par \par \uc2 "He flew over them, hovered over them," said prosecutor Ruben Perez.\par \par \uc2 Investigators say the force of the turbulence from the low flying helicopter's rotor made Delgadillo lose his grip on an inner tube. His body was found later that day near the bridge.\par \par \uc2 Perez said a video from a Border Patrol pole camera will show that Peters' helicopter flew below the bridge and hovered over the water on the day of the drowning.\par \par \uc2 According to the indictment, internal radio transmissions indicate Peters told a Border Patrol agent he was going to try to make the individuals "go back."\par \par \uc2 "He lied and we are going to prove that to you," Perez said.\par \par \uc2 But Thomas Berg, Peters' attorney, told jurors his client didn't lie to investigators but that they misunderstood him when he was initially questioned about the incident a month after it happened. Berg said Peters had to go back and review records about whether he had flown near the bridge on that day.\par \par \uc2 Berg said that on the day of the drowning, Peters responded to a call from Border Patrol agents who were dealing with smugglers near the bridge in Laredo.\par \par \uc2 "It appeared people were in the water. What happened to them after that, (Peters) doesn't know because he left," Berg said.\par \par \uc2 Berg said Peters' helicopter is designed to fly low to the ground but that the aircraft was never closer than 100 feet to the bridge on the day of the drowning.\par \par \uc2 Berg said responding to such calls was routine for Peters.\par \par \uc2 "Why would he be lying about an incident if there was nothing significant about it?" he said.\par \par \uc2 Peters, who was indicted in January, has pleaded not guilty and faces up to five years in prison if convicted.\par \par \uc2 Peters, who is currently stationed in Maine, has worked for Homeland Security since 1997, becoming a helicopter pilot in 2003.\par \par \uc2 The trial was expected to last several days.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2
