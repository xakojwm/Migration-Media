The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ATLANTA (AP) - Some local law enforcement agencies, particularly in the Southeast, are turning over illegal immigrants who commit even minor offenses to federal authorities for deportation, while others are focused on deporting more violent criminals, according to a report released Monday.\par \par \uc2 The report by the Migration Policy Institute, a Washington-based nonpartisan think tank, said conflicting messages from the U.S. government and local political pressure may account for the discrepancy.\par \par \uc2 The study, which examined a program that allows participating local agencies to enforce federal immigration law, found that several agencies in the Southeast were turning over every \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  taken into custody. An influx of immigrants in the generally conservative region has heightened political tension, the report said. North Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee and South Carolina were in the top six in terms of growth rates of foreign-born populations from 1990 to 2009.\par \par \uc2 "This regional pattern reflects common political pressures that stem from rapid demographic change," the report said.\par \par \uc2 The study focused on the 287(g) program -- named for the section of federal law governing it -- overseen by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The U.S. Homeland Security Department, which includes ICE, in 2009 wrote new contracts for the local-federal partnerships and issued new guidelines telling local officers to focus primarily on illegal immigrants charged with crimes like rape, murder, robbery or drug offenses.\par \par \uc2 But top U.S. government officials -- who have said the program that is in place in 71 jurisdictions nationwide can also be useful for deporting illegal immigrants when resources allow -- offer a conflicting message, the report said.\par \par \uc2 ICE spokeswoman Gillian Brigham said in an e-mail that the study affirmed the way ICE enforces immigration law, but that it underestimated the value of deporting people accused of drunken driving, domestic violence and other misdemeanors that affect public safety.\par \par \uc2 The report said ICE needs to do more to ensure consistency in the program, which critics have said has given rise to racial profiling and civil rights violations.\par \par \uc2 The study is based on visits and interviews in seven 287(g) jurisdictions: Cobb and Gwinnett counties in Georgia; Frederick County, Md.; Los Angeles County, Calif.; Prince William County, Va.; Las Vegas; and the state of Colorado. Researchers also analyzed data provided by ICE on all people processed through the program in all participating jurisdictions.\par \par \uc2 In the first 10 months of fiscal year 2010, about half the immigrants detained under the program for transfer to immigration authorities had been accused of serious crimes, such as rape and murder, according to ICE data. The other half had been charged with misdemeanor or civil offenses, or only immigration-related crimes.\par \par \uc2 Enforcement varied widely in the seven jurisdictions studied. For instance, more than 70 percent of those detained for transfer in Las Vegas had been charged with serious crimes. That figure dipped to less than 10 percent in Colorado, Prince William County, Va., Frederick County, Md., and Cobb County, Ga.\par \par \uc2 Although about 68 percent of those handed over to immigration authorities in Colorado were not charged with criminal violations, ICE and state officials say many of those people were high priority because they were passengers in smuggling or human trafficking operations.\par \par \uc2 In Frederick County, Md., and in Cobb and Gwinnett counties in Georgia, authorities flagged for immigration authorities nearly everyone who could be deported. However, officials in those counties said they had enough jail space to detain any person who could be deported, the report said.\par \par \uc2 The Cobb County Sheriff's Office was the first of four sheriff's offices in Georgia to participate in the program, signing the agreement in 2007.\par \par \uc2 "Immigration is a federal issue. However, when illegal aliens come into our community and commit a crime, it becomes a local issue," Cobb County Sheriff Neil Warren says on his department's website.\par \par \uc2 Warren did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday.\par \par \uc2 Gwinnett County Sheriff Butch Conway said in a statement that he hadn't had a chance to read the whole report but that most of the cases flagged by his agency involve felony and misdemeanor offenders, not traffic cases.\par \par \uc2 Los Angeles County is unique among the sites studied: Officials don't check immigration status until someone is convicted of a crime. Still, some 40 percent of people detained for immigration authorities there had committed only minor offenses. On the other hand, the 10 jurisdictions with the highest percentage of people turned over to immigration authorities after committing only traffic offenses are all in the Southeast, the report said.\par \par \uc2 "What we see in Los Angeles is clearly a professional approach towards public safety and law enforcement where resources are allocated and prioritized toward those that are committing serious crimes," said Jerry Gonzales, executive director of the Georgia Association of Latino Elected Officials. "Whereas in the Southeast you see the allocation of resources to non-criminal offenses, which clearly points to a politicized environment that we live in in Georgia."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110131e71v002g8\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PIERRE, S.D. (AP) - The South Dakota Legislature will join the national debate on illegal immigration this year.\par \par \uc2 Three bills seeking to crack down on illegal immigrants have been filed in the Legislature, all patterned after measures already proposed or passed in other states.\par \par \uc2 Rep. Manny Steele, R-Sioux Falls, the prime sponsor of two of the measures, said he wants to protect the public from crimes committed by some who are in the country illegally and make sure immigrants working in South Dakota are doing so legally.\par \par \uc2 "These people who are here legally are part of our society . I welcome them. They belong here," Steele said. "I'm glad they're here. They are helping our economy grow. As far as I'm concerned, they're needed."\par \par \uc2 Steele acknowledged that South Dakota does not have as big of a problem as many other states with illegal immigrants. South Dakota probably only has 2,000 or so illegal immigrants, he said.\par \par \uc2 However, Steele said two illegal immigrants were convicted of murder last year, and the state will pay $15,000 a year to keep them in prison. He said he believes his bills will treat people fairly and will not lead to racial profiling by law officers.\par \par \uc2 Opponents disagree, saying the proposed laws are not needed and will violate people's rights by encouraging racial profiling.\par \par \uc2 Sam Ellingson, program coordinator for the American Civil Liberties Union of South Dakota, said a proposal similar to an Arizona law will force law officers to give priority to immigration enforcement and give less attention to other public safety problems.\par \par \uc2 "Laws like these do not make us safer, and in fact have raised the crime rates in areas where similar bills have been passed," she said.\par \par \uc2 One of Steele's proposals, similar to an Arizona law being challenged in court, would direct law officers enforcing other laws to make reasonable attempts to ask about a suspect's immigration status if there is reason to believe that person is in the U.S. illegally. It also would make it illegal for anyone to transport or conceal an illegal alien or to encourage an illegal alien to come to South Dakota.\par \par \uc2 Steele's second bill is part of a national challenge to automatic U.S. citizenship for children of illegal immigrants. It is intended to encourage Congress to propose an change to the 14th Amendment, which guarantees citizenship to anyone born in the U.S.\par \par \uc2 The third bill, sponsored by Sen. Craig Tieszen, R- Rapid City, would penalize anyone who knowingly employs, transports or conceals an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Steele said the bill requiring law officers to check immigration status during stops for enforcement of other laws has been modified somewhat from the Arizona law. He said he believes it will not lead to racial profiling or discrimination. Officers already check people's identification during traffic stops, and the bill would allow officers to let people go when it's not practical to detain them for a lengthy investigation, he said.\par \par \uc2 However, Ellingson of the ACLU said the organization will oppose Steele's proposal because it would lead to racial profiling, and that part of the Arizona law has been blocked by a federal judge. Some provisions also would be struck down because they are already covered in federal law, which takes precedence, she said.\par \par \uc2 Robert Doody, executive director of the ACLU in South Dakota, said the three bills send a message to businesses and workers that South Dakota does not welcome minority families or economic growth. The measures, if passed, would likely lead to costly lawsuits, he said.\par \par \uc2 Steele said state lawyers have estimated a lawsuit could cost $50,000 to $100,000, which he said is much less than the cost of keeping a lot of illegal immigrants in state prisons after they have been convicted of crimes.\par \par \uc2 The bill dealing with citizenship seeks to require that a child born in the U.S. is a citizen only if at least one parent is a U.S. citizen or a legal immigrant. It would create a compact with other states to issue different birth certificates for those who are citizens and those who are not. Such compacts would have to be approved by Congress, but do not require the president's signature.\par \par \uc2 Supporters of the proposal contend that the wording of the 14th Amendment, which guarantees citizenship to anyone born in the U.S. who is "subject to jurisdiction" of this country, does not apply to children of illegal immigrants because those families do not owe sole allegiance to the U.S.\par \par \uc2 Steele said some people enter the U.S. illegally to give birth to children so those babies will get citizenship. He said supporters of the compact hope eventually to persuade Congress to propose a constitutional change.\par \par \uc2 Ellingson said a compact between the states cannot change the rules on citizenship because state laws cannot change the U.S. Constitution.\par \par \uc2 "It's guaranteed in our legal history that we allow citizenship to those who are born in this country," she said.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110130e71u0038n\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc2}{\*\bkmkend toc2}\b \uc2 With budget problems, WA state steps further into immigration issue\b0\par\par\uc2 MANUEL VALDES   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 1,257 \uc2 words\par \uc2 29 January 2011\par 13:30\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2011.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) - The state's grim financial shape is pushing lawmakers further into the immigration debate, forcing a state historically friendly to immigrants to consider cuts that will impact large segments of legal and illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 The proposed cuts are on top of introduced bills that call for stricter enforcement of immigration law, specifically bills that would force the state to ask for proof of legal residency when obtaining a driver's license.\par \par \uc2 "My whole point is that we ignore, ignore, ignore -- now we have to make real decisions: Does the public think it's a priority to provide benefits for people who are undocumented?" said Sen. Joe Zarelli, R-Ridgefield, the Senate GOP's budget chief. "I believe it's time for prioritizing what we can afford to do. We gotta have that debate."\par \par \uc2 From blueberry fields in Skagit County to the high-tech offices at \uc2 Microsoft\uc2 , immigrant labor, both legal and illegal, is a fuel in many of the state's industries. And no matter their legal status, immigrants contribute to the state's main source of revenue -- the sales tax -- whenever they buy something.\par \par \uc2 "In one year, Washington State has gone from a leader on immigration to a hostile environment for immigrants and their families," said an e-mail from OneAmerica, the state's largest immigrant advocacy group, to supporters, urging them to testify against the driver's licenses bills.\par \par \uc2 During this legislative session, lawmakers have been tasked with two crucial budgetary jobs: They need to close a cash deficit of more than half a billion dollars in the supplemental budget for this fiscal year that ends in June, and they need to write a budget that closes a projected $4.6 billion deficit in the 2011-2013 budget.\par \par \uc2 Gov. Chris Gregoire's proposed budget, which sets the pace for the session, cuts more than half a dozen programs that directly aid immigrants -- from subsidized naturalization classes to transferring \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  inmates in state prisons to federal custody.\par \par \uc2 The two biggest proposals for the next two-year budget, though, are stripping medical coverage to an estimated 27,000 children whose legal status is unclear under the Children's Health Program for savings of $59 million, and eliminating the State Food Assistance Program, which provides food stamps for legal immigrants, for a savings of $45 million.\par \par \uc2 "In the last decade or two, Washington has wisely recognized that immigrants are tax paying, working neighbors to all of us," said Jon Gould, executive director of the Children's Alliance, an advocacy group. "I'm very worried right now that we are at risk of losing those important public structures that allow our immigrant neighbors to be contributing members of the state."\par \par \uc2 It's the third year in a row that a section of the Children's Health Program has been proposed for cuts, but it's the first time that children who may be illegally in the country have been singled out, Gould said.\par \par \uc2 The Department of Social and Health Services has sent thousands of letters to parents of children in the health program, warning them that the state may no longer cover health care for children who are not legally in the country. It then asks parents to send any immigration-related paper work by the beginning of February that may help their case.\par \par \uc2 The state food program was created by a bipartisan Legislature in 1997 after Congress, under welfare reform, imposed a five-year bar on legal immigrants from obtaining food stamps. In Washington, the state stepped in and subsidized the program.\par \par \uc2 Scott Whiteaker, a spokesman for Gregoire, said that the governor looked at state programs that are solely funded by the state in proposing her cuts and is imploring non-profit groups and private businesses to step in and help with whatever they can.\par \par \uc2 "Times that we're in right now really demand cuts that nobody necessarily wants to do," he said.\par \par \uc2 Gregoire's proposals and the licenses bills have sent immigrant advocates to scramble to Olympia. But in a down economy, pitching for programs that serve non-Americans can be a tough sell.\par \par \uc2 "I think that our state and nationally there's an increasing resentment against immigrants, legally or not legally, to be honest with you . and I think it's growing," said Rep. Phyllis Gutierrez Kenney, D-Seattle. "If we don't get immigration reform at the federal level, it's going to get worse."\par \par \uc2 Still, there have been some small victories so far for immigrant advocates. Both the state food program and the children's health programs were spared from cuts in the House of Representative's version of the supplemental budget for this year.\par \par \uc2 "Our belief is that our values as Washingtonians really haven't changed with the economy," Gould said. "The economy and revenue shortfall is what's created the potential loss of these programs."\par \par \uc2 Key lawmakers say that they won't allow cuts to health care for children to pass, as well.\par \par \uc2 "In general, what I have heard from my Senate Democrat colleagues is that they believe that children need to be held harmless from decisions they didn't make," said Senate Majority Leader Lisa Brown.\par \par \uc2 But for Zarelli and others, the question they want asked about these programs for immigrants is if the state can afford them. Zarelli, the GOP's budget expert, said that the state spends about $270 million every two years on health care, welfare, childcare for farmworkers and \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  prisoner.\par \par \uc2 Republicans are pushing for the state to re-enroll users of welfare programs to weed out people who don't qualify -- that includes illegal immigrants and others.\par \par \uc2 Across the country, state lawmakers are venturing further into immigration law. In 2010, 208 laws regarding immigration were passed in 46 legislatures around the country, a record number, according to a National Conference of State Legislatures report.\par \par \uc2 State lawmakers are both responding to budget deficits and lack of action from Congress on overhauling the country's immigration law. Nine states this year are considering bills similar to Arizona's law that imposed the strictest immigration rules in the country.\par \par \uc2 Washington hasn't seen that same kind of support for strict immigration rules. But several bills that would impose asking for proof of legal residency or citizenship when obtaining a driver's license have also been introduced by Democrats and Republicans. Similar measures have been introduced in the past and failed. Washington remains one of three states in the country where proof of legal residency is no required.\par \par \uc2 "Because a driver's license is considered legal identity, it opens up a lot of doors for folks, from being able to obtain government benefits, register to vote, and getting other more positive types of identification, such as a passport. Our state has gained a reputation as the place to come to get a driver's license," said Rep. Mike Armstrong, the sponsor of one of the driver's licenses bills, in a statement.\par \par \uc2 Opponents of such bills say that precluding illegal immigrants from obtaining driver's licenses may lead to people unqualified to drive to be on the roads and lack of insurance among drivers.\par \par \uc2 This past year, a Democrat-controlled Congress declined to take up an overhaul of immigration law. In his State of the Union, President Barack Obama urged a now split Congress to do so this year. But attempts at changing immigration law have failed for years now.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110129e71t003fr\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 HEADLINES\par \par \uc2 A state lawmaker has filed a bill that would crack down on illegal immigration in Georgia and that mirrors some provisions in a controversial law that took effect in Arizona last year. The "Illegal Immigration Reform and Enforcement Act of 2011" was filed by Rep. Matt Ramsey, a Peachtree City Republican who co-chaired a legislative study commission on illegal immigration in the fall. The Georgia legislation would require law enforcement officers to, when enforcing other laws, try to determine an individual's immigration status if an officer "develops reasonable suspicion" that the person is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . The bill would also impose penalties on people who encourage an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  to come to Georgia or who transport or hide illegal immigrants once they're in the state.\par \par \uc2 ODDS & ENDS\par \par \uc2 --The push to allow Sunday alcohol sales in Georgia's grocery and convenience stores is being revived with new legislation filed in both chambers of the General Assembly. And new Republican Gov. Nathan Deal reiterated that if the measure ends up on his desk he'll sign it, so long as it allows local communities to ask voters to decide.\par \par \uc2 --The Senate voted unanimously to undo ex-Gov. Sonny Perdue's veto of a budget overhaul bill. But the House is opting for a different approach with GOP leaders saying they prefer pushing a new bill rather than resurrecting an old one. Speaker David Ralston said the House will send the Senate's bill into committee and introduce its own budget reform legislation.\par \par \uc2 --The head of the Georgia Department of Revenue said the agency tried to head off a computer glitch that removed tax refunds from the bank accounts of more than 30,000 taxpayers over the weekend before the payments were processed. Commissioner Doug MacGinnitie said the department issued about $12 million in tax refunds on Thursday, but quickly realized that it had paid out about $630,000 too much.\par \par \uc2 --Gov. Nathan Deal has signed an executive order directing the Georgia Environmental Finance Authority to develop and launch the Georgia Water Supply Development Program, which will help local governments develop new sources of water supply. He said he is also negotiating with the new governors of Florida and Alabama to resolve the gridlock.\par \par \uc2 QUOTE\par \par \uc2 "The House is more interested in working today than fighting yesterday's battles with a governor who is no longer here and has gone home," -- House Speaker David Ralston, explaining why he will push a new bill on zero-based budgeting rather than taking up a Senate override of a veto Gov. Sonny Perdue issued on the same issue last year.\par \par \uc2 DAYS IN SESSION\par \par \uc2 34 days remain in the 40-day session.\par \par \uc2 LOOK AHEAD\par \par \uc2 The head of the Georgia Student Finance Commission will testify before the House Higher Education Committee on Tuesday and is expected to discuss the status of the state's cash-strapped HOPE scholarship program.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110128e71s0021u\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHOENIX (AP) - Rancher Dan Bell has come face to face with drug smugglers on his southeastern Arizona cattle ranch, he has found the bodies of illegal immigrants who died of exposure on his property, and a Border Patrol agent was killed in December about 5 miles from his home.\par \par \uc2 The 42-year-old has had about enough.\par \par \uc2 He and a group of other southern Arizona ranchers visited the state Legislature in Phoenix on Thursday to explain to lawmakers how dire the situation is on their properties and to ask that something be done.\par \par \uc2 In response, a Senate committee voted 6-1 to pass a bill supporting the ranchers' plan to "restore our border," also known as ROB's plan. It was named for rancher Robert Krentz, whom authorities believe was killed by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  on his land last year.\par \par \uc2 "We need help down here," Bell told The Associated Press after he spoke to the committee. "The place has just gotten out of hand."\par \par \uc2 Bell was friends with Krentz and said the rancher's death shook him and other cattlemen whose properties have become the crossing ground for illegal immigrants and violent drug smugglers.\par \par \uc2 Bell's family has owned their 35,000-square-mile ranch just west of Nogales since the late 1930s. They began seeing violence in the mid-1990s when the government secured the border in California and Texas, funneling traffic to Arizona and ultimately making it the busiest illegal crossing point along the 2,000-mile U.S.-Mexico border.\par \par \uc2 On Bell's property is a memorial to Border Patrol Agent Alexander Kirpnick, who was shot and killed by two drug smugglers on the ranch in 1998 as he tried to arrest them.\par \par \uc2 Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry, 40, was killed in a shootout with border bandits Dec. 14 about 5 miles north of Bell's ranch. Six people were arrested in the probe of his death.\par \par \uc2 Krentz's killing was 90 miles away, but it still hit close to home for Bell and his wife and children, who all live on the family ranch.\par \par \uc2 "Those are all constant reminders," Bell said. "It's in the back of your mind sometimes. We will never forget."\par \par \uc2 The ranchers' plan calls for military units to deploy to the border, the addition of 3,000 Border Patrol agents, stepped-up video surveillance and other technology, and the establishment of citizen advisory boards, among other goals.\par \par \uc2 "A lot of the plan is reliant on the federal government," said Mike Philipsen, a spokesman for Senate Republicans. "There's only so much the state can do."\par \par \uc2 Philipsen stopped short of calling Thursday's vote symbolic.\par \par \uc2 "You can still hold feet to the fire in Congress and say, 'Let's get some of this done,'" he said. "And part of the plan is to get people talking about this. It's a way to say, 'Let's get moving.'"\par \par \uc2 The ranchers came up with the plan last year after Krentz was killed.\par \par \uc2 Those in the federal government have said the border has never been more secure.\par \par \uc2 Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano has said that under President Barack Obama, the Border Patrol has an all-time high of 20,500 agents, and 1,200 National Guard troops have been dispatched to the border. The troops have no arrest power.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110127e71r0029f\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) - Nearly 300 people gathered Thursday on the steps of the state Capitol to rally against an Arizona-style illegal immigration bill introduced in the Nebraska Legislature earlier this month.\par \par \uc2 Those attending the rally carried signs that read "No Arizona in Nebraska" and "No place for hate," and several speakers called on state lawmakers to kill the bill.\par \par \uc2 The measure by Fremont Sen. Charlie Janssen would require police officers, when enforcing other laws, to question the immigration status of those they suspect are in the country illegally. It also would require non-U.S. citizens to carry documents showing their legal status. Failure to do so would be a misdemeanor.\par \par \uc2 The measure also criminalizes harboring, hiding or transporting an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . Violation of that would be a misdemeanor.\par \par \uc2 Critics say the Arizona law encourages racial profiling. A federal judge blocked sections of the law in July, including provisions calling for police to check a person's immigration status while enforcing other laws and requiring immigrants to prove they are in the United States legally.\par \par \uc2 Janssen's measure differs from the Arizona law in that it does not allow law enforcement to make warrantless arrests of suspected illegal immigrants. The Nebraska measure also specifically addresses the issue of profiling by stating "a peace officer's reasonable suspicion shall not be based solely upon a person's race, color, religion, sex or national origin."\par \par \uc2 But those at the rally Thursday characterized the measure as being without compassion for some of the most vulnerable members of society.\par \par \uc2 "We are talking about people, and we are talking about how we treat each other," said Sister Kathleen Erickson, a nun with the Sisters of Mercy of the Americas who has worked with immigration issues for decades.\par \par \uc2 Leroy Stokes, president of the Lincoln branch of the NAACP, went further, calling Janssen's bill the "profiling act" and said it is just one of several bills targeting immigrants or minorities. He pointed to a bill that would eliminate state commissions on Latino-Americans and Indian Affairs and replace them with a single commission, as well as state voters' approval in 2008 of an affirmative-action ban.\par \par \uc2 "It seems to me that minorities are no longer welcome in Nebraska," Stokes said.\par \par \uc2 Janssen spoke to reporters inside the Capitol before the rally, saying he would not attend "a pro-illegal immigration rally."\par \par \uc2 "I fear this will only be a rally that takes potshots at my bill ... and criticizes other senators who have taken a proactive role in fighting illegal immigration," Janssen said.\par \par \uc2 Janssen insisted his bill is not about racial discrimination, but about protecting Nebraska taxpayers who, he says, carry the burden of illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 He also said no one opposed to his bill has offered him a solution to the issue of dealing with illegal immigrants in Nebraska.\par \par \uc2 "I've reached out," he said. "Nobody reaches back."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 The bill is LB48.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Online:\par \par \uc2 Nebraska Legislature: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.nebraskalegislature.gov"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.nebraskalegislature.gov}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110127e71r0027c\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ATLANTA (AP) - A state lawmaker on Wednesday filed a bill that would crack down on illegal immigration in Georgia and that mirrors some provisions in a controversial law that took effect in Arizona last year.\par \par \uc2 The "Illegal Immigration Reform and Enforcement Act of 2011" was filed by Rep. Matt Ramsey, a Peachtree City Republican who co-chaired a legislative study commission on illegal immigration in the fall.\par \par \uc2 The Georgia legislation would require law enforcement officers to, when enforcing other laws, try to determine an individual's immigration status if an officer "develops reasonable suspicion" that the person is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , according to a copy of the bill provided to The Associated Press. Upon confirming that such a person is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , the officer would be authorized to arrest that person and take him or her to a federal jail.\par \par \uc2 The bill would also impose penalties on people who encourage an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  to come to Georgia or who transport or hide illegal immigrants once they're in the state.\par \par \uc2 A federal judge blocked similar provisions in a law enacted in Arizona last year after the federal government filed a lawsuit.\par \par \uc2 Ramsey said he believes the Georgia bill is written in such a way that it should not provoke a federal lawsuit.\par \par \uc2 "We believe it's drawn up in a way that's constitutional, but there may be people in the Obama Justice Department who don't agree," he said. "I would hope they will focus more on securing the border than on suing states."\par \par \uc2 Ramsey said his bill and a similar one expected to be filed in the Senate this week by committee co-chair Sen. Jack Murphy were inspired by concern from constituents about the economic impact of illegal immigrants on the Georgia in a time of tight budgets.\par \par \uc2 State Rep. Pedro Marin, a Democrat from Duluth, said he hasn't read the bill yet but has concerns about what he has been told is in it.\par \par \uc2 "I'm concerned about the possibility of racial profiling," said Marin, adding he has co-signed a new racial profiling bill to be introduced this session.\par \par \uc2 "It troubles me, not just me, but hundreds of thousands of immigrants in this state."\par \par \uc2 Marin said he thinks the bill will "put a black eye on the state of Georgia" at a time when it is competing to attract international businesses.\par \par \uc2 "On the one hand, we are saying 'come here, we want to part of the global economy,' but then we have legislation that would hurt the immigrant community," he said.\par \par \uc2 Ramsey dismissed fears of racial profiling, saying there are specific provisions in the bill to guard against it. The bill also\par \par \uc2 The legislation would also require private employers to use a federal database called E-Verify to check the eligibility of new hires. Currently only public employers and their contractors are required to use the system in Georgia.\par \par \uc2 The bill would also provide incentives for local law enforcement agencies that partner with the federal government on immigration enforcement.\par \par \uc2 The legislation also would require applicants for taxpayer-funded services to present "secure and verifiable identification documents" to ensure illegal immigrants don't have access to public benefits they are barred by law from receiving.\par \par \uc2 Murphy on Wednesday released an editorial to the media outlining the Senate bill he plans to introduce this week. He said the point of his bill is "to make it more difficult for illegal immigrants to find work in Georgia."\par \par \uc2 Like Ramsey's bill, Murphy's would require private employers to run potential new employees through E-Verify. It also requires that subcontractors use E-Verify to check the status of their own employees.\par \par \uc2 Murphy's proposal also would allow law enforcement officers to ask a person who is stopped on suspicion of a crime to produce proof of legal immigration status and to turn suspected illegal immigrants over to federal authorities.\par \par \uc2 Also on Wednesday, state Rep. James Mills, a Gainesville Republican, introduced legislation that would require that all drivers license exams be conducted in English. The bill makes an exception for some temporary license applicants, such as immigrants seeking asylum or granted refugee status. But it places a 10-year limit on such temporary licenses.\par \par \uc2 On Monday, state Sen. Bill Heath, a Republican from Bremen, filed legislation that would prohibit illegal immigrants from receiving worker's compensation benefits.\par \par \uc2 Immigration is expected to be a top issue during this year's legislative session in Georgia. Before the session started legislators "prefiled" bills dealing with illegal immigrants in the state university system and another with employment verification of contractors.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writer Shannon McCaffrey contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110126e71q001k7\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) - Some craved words of comfort and a strong signal that the many promises made since a gunman's rampage stunned the nation just might, in fact, be kept.\par \par \uc2 Others sought much more than polite talk and a show of etiquette via a bipartisan seating arrangement -- a turnaround in tone, yes, but also something tangible: More jobs, less spending, a dramatic course-correction for a country that, for some, seems headed down the wrong path.\par \par \uc2 The everyday Americans who tuned in for President Obama's State of the Union address heard, once more, the many calls for compromise and saw political adversaries sitting shoulder-to-shoulder in an unusual demonstration of unity. Some even cheered when the president referred to "the American family" as something more consequential than party or political preference.\par \par \uc2 And yet there was a common refrain among those who watched Tuesday night from bars and college campuses -- even from the living rooms of homes in a town still scarred by tragedy.\par \par \uc2 Far more important than the words they heard will be what comes next.\par \par \uc2 "Them sitting together is a fine start but standing together tomorrow would be better, and I have very little confidence that they'll be standing together tomorrow," said Ron Canady, a retired telephone communications worker in Tucson.\par \par \uc2 In ways big and small, this southern Arizona town shared a stage with the president on a night meant to gauge where our nation has been and where it is headed. The address came not three weeks after an alleged assassin opened fire at a congresswoman's meet-and-greet here, leaving a nation in mourning for the six lives lost and politicians propagandizing a new era of civility.\par \par \uc2 On Tuesday, the parents of the youngest victim, 9-year-old Christina Taylor Green, sat in the chamber of the U.S. House as President Obama spoke of moving "forward together, or not at all." Also in attendance were one of the doctors and an intern who helped save Rep. Gabrielle Giffords' life. Her place on the House floor was marked by an empty chair. All around it sat members of the Arizona congressional delegation, Republicans and Democrats side-by-side.\par \par \uc2 Here in Tucson, where memorials to the dead and wounded still cover a street corner outside of Giffords' office, people watched the speech longing for the same message as much of America: that there is still reason for hope.\par \par \uc2 Susan Hileman said she found one.\par \par \uc2 Hileman was holding Christina Green's hand when the shooting erupted. Though shot three times herself, 58-year-old Hileman is recovering. She watched the speech from her Tucson home, crying when Obama referred to Christina and the camera panned to her parents and brother, seated next to the first lady.\par \par \uc2 "I love when he talked about our robust democracy -- that's what I took Christina to see that day," Hileman told The Associated Press. She said the president's speech -- despite her own lingering grief -- made her proud to be an American. "I believe wholeheartedly that we can be the kind of nation Christina thought we can be. We need to listen instead of scream at one another.\par \par \uc2 "We're all in this together," she said, adding that, in her view, the state of the union "is better than it has been and not as good as it's going to be."\par \par \uc2 That same uplifting attitude -- perhaps unexpected at a time of high unemployment, an ongoing war and persistent debates over everything from health care coverage to the deficit -- was shared by others who watched around the country: a student looking for work, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  hoping for citizenship, a retired insurance man who acknowledged "serious problems" but remained "very hopeful."\par \par \uc2 Ian Hainline, 21, studies political science at Tufts University in Medford, Mass. In 2008, his father was laid off and his mother was forced to move from part-time to a full-time job to help support him and his sister. Today, Hainline said, both of his parents are working, and he credited the president for helping begin to turn the economy back around.\par \par \uc2 "I'm sitting here in the midst of job-application season, feeling very confident about my ability to find a job," said Hainline, who supported Obama in 2008.\par \par \uc2 Carlos Savio Oliveira lives in Massachusetts but is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Brazil, brought to the U.S. by his parents when he was 8. Oliveira recognizes that his future largely depends on the many promises to get Democrats and Republicans to work together. Nevertheless, he said: "I'm hopeful ..."\par \par \uc2 The 22-year-old was elated over Obama's call for Congress to -- "once and for all" -- fix illegal immigration. "Wow," he said. "He nailed it, and it felt good."\par \par \uc2 Retired insurance executive Paul Marabella, of Medford, N.J., watched the speech from Philadelphia's National Constitution Center, a nonpartisan institution dedicated to increasing public understanding of the Constitution. Marabella, 68, lamented the lack of bipartisanship that has plagued Congress, acknowledging "we have some serious problems."\par \par \uc2 And yet, after the address, even his tone was a bit brighter. "I feel better about the president, and I'm very hopeful for Congress. Some of them will follow his lead," he said. "There were some baby steps in terms of sitting together. Now they ought to start walking."\par \par \uc2 College student Josh Schmidt dismissed all the talk of newfound civility. He gathered with about a dozen other students in a meeting room at the College of Charleston in Charleston, S.C., to eat pizza and take in the president's speech. The 19-year-old said this so-called new spirit of compromise, if it really exists, wouldn't last long.\par \par \uc2 "We're not talking about the real critical issue. Talk and debate is good, but we're not looking at things like gun control," he said, referring to the Tucson shootings.\par \par \uc2 That same cynicism was shared by Navy Seaman Ronnie Valentine, who watched the speech with buddies at a Ruby Tuesday's restaurant outside the gates of Pensacola Naval Air Station in Florida. Obama, he said, means well but can only do so much. "There is so much going on behind the scenes," he said.\par \par \uc2 Tea party advocates, especially, found little to cheer in Obama's address. In Indiana, college secretary Monica Boyer hosted a small viewing party for three board members of the tea party group, Kosciusko County Silent No More. She said they all laughed when the president promised more government transparency, and were unimpressed with the gesture of the Democratic and Republican members of Congress sitting together to watch the speech.\par \par \uc2 "A ploy from the Democrats," she called the move, saying: "If this is the first step that the Republicans take to working together, I don't care where they sit, but we will be watching their policies very closely. We did not elect them to compromise. We did not elect them to move to the center. We elected conservatives ...\par \par \uc2 "So if they just join hands and sing Kumbaya," she said, "that will be the last year we will have faith in the Republican Party."\par \par \uc2 Still others said they were waiting for Obama to back up his "centrist"-sounding proposals with action -- namely through cuts in federal spending.\par \par \uc2 "I want to see him actually reduce spending, not just freeze it," said Kenneth Cobb, a tea party organizer from Bemidji, Minn. Cobb said he's all for civil, levelheaded dialogue, but not at the expense of the right to speak out against a federal government he sees as spending itself into a "slavery to debt."\par \par \uc2 "You can still be civil without compromising on principles," he said.\par \par \uc2 In Tucson, some 20 people gathered at Ron Canady's home for a viewing party. Like other Americans, they wanted to hear about jobs and health care and the war in Afghanistan. But more so, they wanted their president to reaffirm his commitment to unifying Congress -- and the country. When the president spoke of Giffords, and her vacant seat suddenly popped up on the TV screen, several stopped sipping wine and wiped away tears.\par \par \uc2 Ron and his wife, Pat, consider Giffords a friend and sometimes volunteered at events like the one on Jan. 8 that turned into a bloodbath. A signed photograph of the congresswoman and Pat, framed the day before the shooting, hangs in their home office.\par \par \uc2 Their two vastly differing views on the state of this union may best reflect the conflicting hopes, and fears, of a country still struggling to recover from the many tough times of the past, the tragedy in Tucson being just one.\par \par \uc2 Said Ron, the self-described "eternal pessimist" of the family: "I think we're in horrible shape, and not just economically and socially. We're two or three different countries under the same flag."\par \par \uc2 Pat, however, refused to lose faith.\par \par \uc2 "I'm hopeful for our country to get back on track because if we don't start coming together, we're going to fall apart," she said. "My prayer is the situation in Tucson will help bring that about in the next two years. Maybe this is an awakening for the country."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Contributing to this report were Associated Press writers Russell Contreras in Boston; Kathy Matheson in Philadelphia; Bruce Smith in Charleston, S.C; Melissa Nelson in Pensacola, Fla.; Rick Callahan in Indianapolis; and Trevor Born in Minneapolis.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110126e71q00112\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.

Matt Ramsey, co-chair of a committee that studied the issue in the fall, announced his proposal for an "Illegal Immigration Reform and Enforcement Act of 2011" in an editorial released Tuesday afternoon to media outlets.\par \par \uc2 Ramsey told The Associated Press he plans to file the proposal this week.\par \par \uc2 His proposal calls for requiring private employers to use a federal database called E-Verify to ensure that their hires are eligible to work in this country, Ramsey said. Currently only public employers and their contractors are required to use the system in Georgia.\par \par \uc2 The legislation also would require applicants for taxpayer-funded services to present "secure and verifiable identification documents" to ensure illegal immigrants don't have access to public benefits they are barred by law from receiving. It also would seek to provide "new tools for law enforcement officers" give them "greater latitude in handling immigration issues during a lawful stop or detention."\par \par \uc2 Ramsey added that his measure contemplates establishing greater incentives for law enforcement agencies to apply to participate in federal partnerships that aid in identification and transfer of illegal immigrants. He said it also would create criminal penalties for anyone who encourages an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  to come to Georgia or who transports or harbors an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who's in the state.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110125e71p002j5\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

Two other men and the Vietnamese national were arrested in April 2006 near the border near Richford.\par \par \uc2 Laforme was sentenced to time served. According to the Burlington Free Press, he has spent about 21 months in jail, much of that time in Canada while fighting extradition to the United States.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Information from: The Burlington Free Press, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110123e71n001sz\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

PAULSON   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 611 \uc2 words\par \uc2 22 January 2011\par 12:53\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2011.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 DENVER (AP) - A bipartisan focus on jobs and the economy -- and Democrats' control of the Senate and governor's office -- may quickly doom an early effort by Colorado's Republican Senate caucus to enact an Arizona-style immigration law this year.\par \par \uc2 Illegal immigration is a key part of the Senate caucus agenda -- but it isn't shared by their colleagues in the Republican-controlled House, where House Speaker Frank McNulty insists the party is most concerned with jobs.\par \par \uc2 Gov. John Hickenlooper has vowed to veto any law similar to Arizona's, saying immigration is a federal responsibility. Democratic lawmakers say the divisive issue must take a back seat to creating jobs.\par \par \uc2 "Some of the other things that are coming forward, whether it's the Arizona-style immigration legislation or otherwise, I think that those are social wedge issues that are designed to distract us from our real focus," said Senate President Brandon Shaffer.\par \par \uc2 Shaffer has sent the GOP bill to the Senate State Affairs Committee, where it is likely to die.\par \par \uc2 That doesn't deter Senate Minority Leader Mike Kopp. "We campaigned on those issues and now that we've been elected, we'll pursue it," Kopp said.\par \par \uc2 The caucus bill would allow police officers to arrest anyone they suspect may be an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . It does not include a divisive element of Arizona's law that has been put on hold by a court: requiring immigrants to carry immigration registration papers.\par \par \uc2 Senate Republicans also want to compel employers to verify workers' immigration status as well as meaningful enforcement of existing state immigration laws.\par \par \uc2 State estimates of the number of illegal immigrants in Colorado range from 225,000 to 500,000. Republicans claim they cost state taxpayers $1.2 billion a year for public education, corrections, mandatory translation services and other costs, based on estimates from the Federation for American Immigration Reform, a conservative watchdog group.\par \par \uc2 Julien Ross, director of the Colorado Immigrant Rights Coalition, said an Arizona-style law would devastate Colorado's economy. Ross said the Arizona hospitality industry alone has lost more than $253 million in revenue since the law went into effect last year.\par \par \uc2 Colorado passed some of the nation's toughest state immigration laws during a 2006 special session with Democrats in the majority. One law requires police agencies to report to immigration officials anyone they arrest whom they suspect may be in the country illegally. It's up to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to determine what to do with those reports.\par \par \uc2 Don Christensen, director of the County Sheriffs of Colorado, said his group opposed previous GOP legislation that would have required authorities to arrest illegal immigrants because sheriffs don't want to enforce federal law and cherish discretion when deciding whether to make an arrest.\par \par \uc2 The sheriffs' association did support former Gov. Bill Ritter's decision to enlist Colorado in the rapidly expanding Secure Communities program run by ICE. Fingerprints obtained during jail bookings are used to determine a person's immigration status and any previous arrests. Hickenlooper also supports the program, which operates in 35 states. ICE hopes it is universal by 2013.\par \par \uc2 Hickenlooper said during his campaign that changes to immigration law must be a federal effort.\par \par \uc2 This session, Democratic lawmakers will first support bills that help the economy, Shaffer said. Some Senate Democrats want to allow illegal immigrants who've graduated from state high schools to pay in-state tuition at public universities -- a way, they say, to support Colorado's financially struggling colleges. That proposal, however, would face a stern test in the GOP-controlled House.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110122e71m001vf\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

Angela Giron and Sen. Michael Johnston are drafting legislation that would allow students who are in the country illegally and who have graduated from Colorado high schools to pay in-state tuition. They would not receive a state stipend that other in-state students receive though.\par \par \uc2 Giron says some of the best and brightest students in the state are leaving because they are forced to pay higher tuition.\par \par \uc2 Opponents have argued it violates a federal law that bars states from offering illegal immigrants any benefit that's not given to citizens from other states.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110119e71j001ul\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ATLANTA (AP) - Federal prosecutors said they have uncovered and dismantled a three-man ring accused of plotting to smuggle semiautomatic assault rifles across the border to Mexico.\par \par \uc2 Daniel Bernal-Perez, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , pleaded guilty Wednesday to charges of possessing four firearms. He decided not to plead to a second count of conspiring to traffic illegal guns, frustrating prosecutors who vowed to bring the case to trial.\par \par \uc2 Bernal-Perez's guilty plea comes on the heels of court appearances earlier this month by two men prosecutors say worked with him to smuggle the guns: Dario Rodriguez-Gomez and Manuel Gamez-Valenzuela. Both men pleaded guilty to charges of plotting to traffic firearms, and Rodriguez-Gomez also pleaded guilty to \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  charges.\par \par \uc2 The men each face more than five years in prison time and a fine of more than $250,000 when they are sentenced later this year.\par \par \uc2 Acting on a tip, prosecutors said they staked out Bernal-Perez's home in the Atlanta suburb of Doraville in January 2010 after learning that he was working with Gamez-Valenzuela in a plot to buy eight to 10 semiautomatic guns to send to Mexico.\par \par \uc2 They watched as Rodriguez-Gomez drove up to the home, carried in a heavy box, and left later with an empty box, according to court records. After the men left, agents who raided the house found four semiautomatic rifles, along with large-capacity magazines.\par \par \uc2 U.S. Attorney Sally Quillian Yates said federal prosecutors are dedicated to unraveling the "trail of guns and violence that runs from Georgia to Mexico and back."\par \par \uc2 "These defendants acquired semiautomatic assault rifles with the intent to transport them to Mexico where they would have undoubtedly ended up in the hands of members of the extremely violent drug cartels that operate there," she said.\par \par \uc2 Defense attorneys, meanwhile, said prosecutors were overstating the charges. Page Pate, who represented Gamez-Valenzuela, said his client never purchased any guns, but only asked around to determine if anyone knew where they could get guns.\par \par \uc2 "There was no evidence that my client had any intention of sending those guns to Mexico," said Pate, who said his client pleaded guilty because he had already been held in detention for months waiting for a trial. "He was simply inquiring about the purchase in firearms for an acquaintance he knew in Georgia."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110119e71j001el\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 HELENA, Mont. (AP) - The Montana House gave initial approval Tuesday to a bill banning illegal immigrants from receiving workers' compensation insurance benefits, the first of several bills expected to deal with either immigration or the beleaguered insurance program for injured workers.\par \par \uc2 The measure was endorsed on a 60-40 vote Tuesday and faces a largely procedural final vote Wednesday before going to the Senate.\par \par \uc2 Backers of the proposal argue it sends a message to those wrongly employing illegal immigrants. They said it would help, admittedly in a very small way, fix the state's problem with high work comp insurance rates.\par \par \uc2 But the bill was more about illegal immigration than work comp, which is expected to be the subject of several reform proposals this legislative session.\par \par \uc2 Opponents countered that the workers will still get injured, and hospitals will be left picking up the tab for treating them in emergencies. Those costs will then be shifted to consumers and other insurance companies, they pointed out.\par \par \uc2 Businesses who, perhaps mistakenly, hire an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  and pay for their work comp could be subject to a big lawsuit when the insurance doesn't pay, said one opponent. Testimony showed only perhaps four cases where work comp paid claims last year to illegal immigrants in Montana.\par \par \uc2 "This is dynamite. It might only be four cases, but it could put an employer out of business," said Rep. Walter McNutt, R-Sidney. "Think hard before you vote for this. You may not be doing the best thing you can for the business people and employers of this state."\par \par \uc2 Illegal immigration, although not nearly as big of an issue in Montana as other parts of the West, is expected to be the subject of several legislative initiatives.\par \par \uc2 A bill heard last week in committee would require the state to use a federal database to verify legal immigration status before issuing a driver's license. Supporters of that bill say it is needed to make sure illegal immigrants don't get a driver's license. Opponents argued it would subject many law-abiding Montanans to the federal background check.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110119e71j0015j\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 HELENA, Mont. (AP) - The Montana House gave initial approval Tuesday to a bill banning illegal immigrants from receiving workers' compensation insurance benefits, the first of several bills expected to deal with either immigration or the beleaguered insurance program for injured workers.\par \par \uc2 The measure was endorsed on a 60-40 vote Tuesday and faces a largely procedural final vote Wednesday before going to the Senate.\par \par \uc2 Backers of the proposal argue it sends a message to those wrongly employing illegal immigrants. They said it would help, admittedly in a very small way, fix the state's problem with high work comp insurance rates.\par \par \uc2 But the bill was more about illegal immigration than work comp, which is expected to be the subject of several reform proposals this legislative session.\par \par \uc2 Opponents countered that the workers will still get injured, and hospitals will be left picking up the tab for treating them in emergencies. Those costs will then be shifted to consumers and other insurance companies, they pointed out.\par \par \uc2 Businesses who, perhaps mistakenly, hire an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  and pay for their work comp could be subject to a big lawsuit when the insurance doesn't pay, said one opponent. Testimony showed only perhaps four cases where work comp paid claims last year to illegal immigrants in Montana.\par \par \uc2 "This is dynamite. It might only be four cases, but it could put an employer out of business," said Rep. Walter McNutt, R-Sidney. "Think hard before you vote for this. You may not be doing the best thing you can for the business people and employers of this state."\par \par \uc2 Illegal immigration, although not nearly as big of an issue in Montana as other parts of the West, is expected to be the subject of several legislative initiatives.\par \par \uc2 A bill heard last week in committee would require the state to use a federal database to verify legal immigration status before issuing a driver's license. Supporters of that bill say it is needed to make sure illegal immigrants don't get a driver's license. Opponents argued it would subject many law-abiding Montanans to the federal background check.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110118e71i002b5\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 LOS ANGELES (AP) - Laura Enriquez wanted her boyfriend to get a taste of her Alaska vacation last summer, so she walked on glaciers in a pair of his shoes and held up his photo when taking snapshots of the scenery.\par \par \uc2 It was the best the 24-year-old graduate student could do because her boyfriend, who was brought here from Mexico by his parents as a child, is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  and can't risk traveling anywhere identification is required.\par \par \uc2 For the past two years, the couple have navigated some of life's rites of passage with this in mind. She does the driving and often pays because even with a college degree it's hard for him to find work.\par \par \uc2 The death of the Dream Act last month dashed their hopes of a path to citizenship. While \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students pushed for the bill to improve their access to education and jobs after graduation, the legislation also would have eased the often overlooked challenges of making friends and dating without papers.\par \par \uc2 On college campuses, \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students face a social barrier anywhere photo identification like a driver's license is required: from taking a road trip with friends to bar hopping to catching a flight.\par \par \uc2 That can make it difficult to deepen friendships or relationships -- or to date at all.\par \par \uc2 Nancy Guarneros, a 23-year-old graduate student, remembers how she was primping for a special night out with her boyfriend when he told her they were going to a club. She panicked.\par \par \uc2 "It's like, oh my gosh, how can you take me somewhere that requires government ID? What were you thinking?" Guarneros recalled at a recent meeting students held in Los Angeles to talk about so-called "cross-status" dating.\par \par \uc2 It isn't clear how many young couples are in similar relationships. Researchers say it would be tough to find out, but the number has likely grown since children brought here as illegal immigrants after the country's 1986 legalization program have come of age and it has become tougher to get a green card through marriage.\par \par \uc2 Illegal immigration peaked during the 1990s, with 4.5 million people arriving during the decade, according to a 2010 report by the Pew Hispanic Center. Those who arrived as small children are now teenagers or in their mid-20s.\par \par \uc2 U.S. citizens and green card holders date illegal immigrants at all ages, but researchers say it's probably more frequent on college campuses, which foster diversity and create a space where students feel safer revealing their status.\par \par \uc2 It's especially likely for those students and 20-somethings who were brought here as toddlers and grew up on American cartoons, speak flawless English and have American friends.\par \par \uc2 Many never knew they were illegal immigrants until they learned at age 16, unlike their peers, they couldn't get a driver's license.\par \par \uc2 "They go through Americanizing experiences. They grow up watching Barney and the Power Rangers. They go to prom. They do all these things American kids are doing," said Roberto Gonzales, a sociology professor at the University of Washington.\par \par \uc2 "What happens at 16, 17, 18 years old is when everything becomes real for them, they can't move through American rites of passage," he said.\par \par \uc2 Over the last year, many of these students made national headlines pushing for the Dream Act. The bill would have provided a route to legal status for hundreds of thousands of immigrants under 30 years old who were brought to the United States before age 16, lived in the country five years, graduated from high school or gained an equivalency degree and who joined the military or attended college.\par \par \uc2 The legislation shot down by the Senate in December was championed by immigrant advocates as a first step toward a broader legalization of the country's 10 million to 12 million illegal immigrants and was reviled by critics who said it would fuel uncontrolled migration.\par \par \uc2 Issues like dating and friendships may seem trivial -- but not to teens and college students yearning to fit in.\par \par \uc2 Illegal immigrant\uc2  youth often become angry and depressed when they learn they're living in a country not truly their own and can't find work, said Carola Suarez-Orozco, professor of applied psychology and co-director of Immigration Studies at New York University.\par \par \uc2 And while getting an education and a job top their worries, students say they also struggle to have a normal social life.\par \par \uc2 Dating isn't easy, especially for young men who can't drive and often don't have cash to pay for a date since they can't get a steady job.\par \par \uc2 The students are also viewed with suspicion by the families of their U.S. boyfriends and girlfriends who think they're after a green card.\par \par \uc2 "That's like the biggest elephant in the room," said Erick Huerta, a 26-year-old college student from Los Angeles.\par \par \uc2 "In my last relationship, she actually told me her mom told her, 'Mija,' be careful because you know those people, they only want one thing," he told the students at the meeting, to a chorus of chuckles.\par \par \uc2 For those who date illegal immigrants, there's a constant worry their partners will get deported. They find themselves making excuses as to why the couple can't meet friends at a bar or travel.\par \par \uc2 Both are often consumed by guilt: citizens, for the privileges they have; illegal immigrants for the burdens they shoulder.\par \par \uc2 And that's before they graduate from college. The pressures only get harder when they leave the safety of campus.\par \par \uc2 Marriage was once seen as a sure-fire ticket to a green card. But many illegal immigrants now need to return to their birth countries to apply for papers and will be barred from returning for a decade unless they get a special waiver.\par \par \uc2 Enriquez said her boyfriend has made himself a promise: he won't wed until he's already got his green card so there's no doubt that he's marrying for love.\par \par \uc2 That's fine for Enriquez, who is in no rush to get to the altar. But she wishes they could travel together like other young couples.\par \par \uc2 For now, she'll have to be content to share her journeys with him through photographs, including one of herself holding up his picture with Alaskan glaciers in the background.\par \par \uc2 In some way, he's been there, too.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110116e71g002a5\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

SOLOMON BANDA   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 730 \uc2 words\par \uc2 16 January 2011\par 16:52\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2011.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 GREELEY, Colo. (AP) - A local school board member and radio station owner has come under fire for airing an editorial denouncing the holiday honoring slain civil rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The broadcaster remains unrepentant and defiant in the wake of community outcry.\par \par \uc2 Brett Reese is airing the editorial four times daily -- up from two -- on his station KELS-FM 104.7. He is unapologetic that portions of the editorial that call King a "plastic god," a "sexual degenerate," and "an America hating communist" appear verbatim on a website with links to a white supremacist group.\par \par \uc2 "Facts are facts, truth is truth," he said, adding that he might pre-empt other programing to air the editorial round the clock. The 40-year-old former carpenter claims he helped build houses for Habitat for Humanity in the Mississippi Delta and once dated an African American woman. He insists he's not racist.\par \par \uc2 The Mountain States Anti-Defamation League has asked Reese to stop broadcasting the editorial. The school board passed a resolution last week supporting the holiday and calling the editorial "inflammatory and detrimental to our district and community." The vote came after Reese walked out of the meeting.\par \par \uc2 "Timed as they are, Mr. Reese's words demean the existence of the Martin Luther King Holiday and its honoring of not just Reverend King but of his messages of equal rights, peaceful demonstration, civility and respect," the board said in its resolution.\par \par \uc2 Mayor Tom Norton, a former state legislator, said Reese's views don't represent Greeley, which holds an annual MLK Day March and celebration.\par \par \uc2 "I find it difficult to figure out where he's coming from," Norton said.\par \par \uc2 Reese said some advertisers have departed the low-power FM station, which he has owned since 2000, over the editorial. But he said he is financially able to survive indefinitely without sponsors. He said he's received death threats.\par \par \uc2 He also said that he's not trying to become a lightning rod for debate over the holiday, which was controversial in some states at its inception. "That's not what my push is. I think it's important for people to discuss any issue openly, freely and without being assassinated or bankrupted."\par \par \uc2 He's an elected member of the Greeley-Evans School District 6 board since 2009. The Greeley Tribune began writing about the radio editorial earlier this month.\par \par \uc2 Reese had aired the editorial, which he said was sent to the station in an anonymous letter, in relative obscurity for the past three Januarys.\par \par \uc2 Greeley, about 60 miles north of Denver is nestled in the center of mostly agricultural Weld County and has a large meatpacking plant, \uc2 JBS Swift & Co\uc2 ., which was hit in a 2006 federal raid targeting \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  workers.\par \par \uc2 "It's a very conservative town," said Ceta Mercadal, 21, a sociology and Africana studies major at the University of Northern Colorado, who grew up in New Orleans and is African American. "When I first got here, I felt like I was one of a kind."\par \par \uc2 Many of the claims in Reese's editorial were spun out of FBI efforts in the 1960s to discredit King, including charges of marital infidelities.\par \par \uc2 "It's hurtful and totally unnecessary," said Sabrina Harms, 17, a senior at Greeley West High School, one of four high schools in the district. "Thank you for sharing the information but I think that Martin Luther King's accomplishments stand as they are."\par \par \uc2 Reese said he began carrying a .45 caliber semi-automatic handgun, including to school board meetings, because of the death threats. But that stopped Thursday after a judge issued a restraining order over alleged threats he made to a rival radio station about would-be advertisers. A court hearing is scheduled for Jan. 21.\par \par \uc2 Reese said a message he left at the rival station about "having a shootout" over sponsors was misinterpreted and that he'd stop carrying a gun to avoid trouble.\par \par \uc2 Bryan Wright, the only African American principal in the district, sees a learning experience for students in the editorial slamming King.\par \par \uc2 "To assume somebody is perfect because they're famous is misleading," Wright said. "What makes us special is that we're allowed to do something great despite our shortcomings."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110116e71g00297\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

(AP) - A witness in the trial of three former Pennsylvania police officers charged with orchestrating a cover-up of the beating death of an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  says she saw one of the defendants conferring with one of the assailants.\par \par \uc2 Former Shenandoah police chief Matthew Nestor and two subordinates, William Moyer and Jason Hayes, are charged with obstructing an FBI investigation into the July 2008 attack on 25-year-old Luis Ramirez. Prosecutors allege that the officers helped a group of white high school football players concoct a cover story.\par \par \uc2 The three each face federal obstruction of justice and conspiracy charges. Moyer also faces charges for allegedly lying to the FBI and attempting to conceal evidence. Two men convicted of a federal hate crime in the case are awaiting sentencing.\par \par \uc2 Ramirez's friend, Arielle Garcia, testified Friday that she saw Hayes conferring with one of the assailants shortly after the fight.\par \par \uc2 Eileen Burke of Shenandoah testified that it appeared to her that Moyer wanted to kick the victim, and she told him he would have to arrest her if he did so.\par \par \uc2 But Burke, a former Philadelphia police officer, acknowledged under cross-examination that she had not mentioned the incident during an earlier hearing. Another witness, Lt. John Kaczmarcyzk of the Mahanoy City police, testified that he had not seen Moyer near Ramirez or arguing with Burke on the night of the beating.\par \par \uc2 Brian Scully, 20, of Shenandoah, who has pleaded guilty in juvenile court, said he and three others began planning a cover-up of the beating shortly after it had ended.\par \par \uc2 "We said we've got to get our stories straight," Scully testified. "We were trying to cover it up ... to be on the same page."\par \par \uc2 Defense attorney Frank Nocito, who represents Hayes, suggested on cross-examination that Scully has not been charged as an adult in the case and has a motive to help prosecutors.\par \par \uc2 The trial is scheduled to continue Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Information from: Pottsville Republican and Herald, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.republicanherald.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.republicanherald.com}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110115e71f00299\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Omaha World-Herald. Jan. 12, 2011\par \par \uc2 Unpleasant option of paroling nonviolent prisoners could save Nebraska money\par \par \uc2 Hard budget times require unpalatable measures. So it is with Nebraska's likely move to save $15 million by paroling around 1,000 nonviolent prisoners out of the correctional system over two years.\par \par \uc2 Still, Nebraska has a reasonable chance of making such an approach work. Some of the positive factors:\par \par \uc2 The state correctional system has an able top administrator, Bob Houston, as well as a capable Parole Board. Nebraska commendably has moved in recent years to strengthen substance abuse treatments for inmates as well as prisoner re-entry programs. And an array of Nebraska leaders in government, criminal justice and the nonprofit community have worked to promote alternatives to incarceration for many nonviolent offenders.\par \par \uc2 About 88 percent of Nebraska parolees do not re-offend within three years of their release. That number compares well to the situation in many states.\par \par \uc2 In addition, Nebraska will be able to achieve the cost savings without needing to consider releasing any violent offenders. Kentucky's governor, in contrast, triggered a political firestorm in 2008 after he proposed a prison-release plan that included felons convicted of murder, rape and other violent crimes.\par \par \uc2 That said, Nebraska's proposed inmate release program can be expected to face considerable challenges. As a recent World-Herald news article explained, the state will need to make sure it has enough parole officers, unburdened by excessive caseloads, to handle the expanded responsibility.\par \par \uc2 State Sen. Colby Coash of Lincoln rightly expresses concern that many paroled offenders won't receive the mental health services they need. Around one-fifth of inmates have mental health problems.\par \par \uc2 The budgetary benefits of shifting some inmates out of custodial care are, not surprisingly, striking. Incarceration in Nebraska costs around $29,000 annually; parole supervision, around $3,560.\par \par \uc2 Prisons are the fifth-largest spending item in most states. As a result, early prisoner release has become a major trend for state governments, in light of the widespread budget woes.\par \par \uc2 With adequate planning and consultation, Nebraska has a reasonably good opportunity to succeed at this difficult but unavoidable task.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Lincoln Journal Star. Jan. 11, 2011\par \par \uc2 Redistricting needs public input\par \par \uc2 The joke on redistricting is that if the political parties could, they would run political boundaries through marital beds when the spouses belonged to different parties.\par \par \uc2 The underlying message in the humor is that political parties will go to extreme lengths to gain political advantage. The goal is to create as many districts as possible with a party majority.\par \par \uc2 The term "gerrymandering" -- a word derived from the plan by Massachusetts Gov. Elbridge Gerry to lay out a district shaped like a salamander -- refers to the creation of oddly shaped districts in the attempt to divide votes to elect the maximum number of Republicans or Democrats.\par \par \uc2 One doesn't have to go back too far in Nebraska history to find a worst-case example of how not to go about the task, which occurs after every new census to maintain the concept of one person, one vote.\par \par \uc2 After the 1990 census, the Legislature came up with a redistricting plan and jammed it through quickly with little opportunity for the public to comment. The plan eventually was ruled invalid by the Nebraska Supreme Court.\par \par \uc2 The high court pointed out that the plan failed to follow the requirement of the Nebraska Constitution that district boundaries follow county lines whenever practical.\par \par \uc2 It was a royal mess. Two legislative candidates who ran in the spring on the Legislature's first plan found themselves on the other side of the line in the general election after senators met in special session to devise districts that met constitutional requirements.\par \par \uc2 In contrast, senators after the 2000 census were careful not to repeat those mistakes when they devised new district boundaries.\par \par \uc2 They took pains to ensure that the public had ample time to comment. For example, a public hearing on proposed changes to boundaries to congressional districts included two-way videoconferencing from six satellite locations around the state.\par \par \uc2 As a result of the feedback, senators dropped a plan to move Gage and Madison counties to the 3rd congressional district. Instead York and Saline counties were transferred.\par \par \uc2 Conventional wisdom holds that the widespread availability of digital information on voting history and political affiliation boosts the temptation for political parties to become ever more creative in fashioning district boundaries.\par \par \uc2 Thanks to the state Constitution, Nebraskans might be spared districts that resemble salamanders.\par \par \uc2 But the best remedy against partisan mischief is for the boundaries to be drawn in a process that is open to the public and permits voters to express their views.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Kearney Hub. Jan. 12, 2011\par \par \uc2 Can smokers hack up another $73 million?\par \par \uc2 Heart, lung and cancer organizations have proposed an idea that parallels recent anti-smoking laws, and they contend their plan could slice almost $73 million annually from the state of Nebraska's revenue shortfall.\par \par \uc2 The $72.9 million bump is enough to take a healthy slice out of the near $1 billion revenue gap for the next two budget years. Or, if you're serious about improving our state's highways, the $72.9 million is about two-thirds of the $125 million that's necessary to take on new road projects, not just maintain the highways that we have today.\par \par \uc2 Not surprisingly, the idea proposed by the American Cancer Society, American Heart Association, American Lung Association and the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids in Nebraska is to hike our state's cigarette tax by $1.35 per pack.\par \par \uc2 Nebraska's current cigarette tax -- 64 cents per pack -- ranks 38th nationally and compares with the U.S. average of $1.45 per pack.\par \par \uc2 The tax hike would follow recent actions in Nebraska that banned smoking in bars, restaurants and other public buildings.\par \par \uc2 As if it's not tough enough to step outside for a smoke, if the tax hike proposal were to win approval, our state's smokers would be shelling out hundreds of dollars more per year to practice their unhealthy habit.\par \par \uc2 Polling shows 73 percent of Nebraskans support boosting cigarette taxes.\par \par \uc2 Is hiking taxes on smokers a good idea? It might be if it helps smokers quit or prevents folks from taking up the habit. As for a tax solution, the idea has only limited merit.\par \par \uc2 We can't say it's exactly fair to rest so much more of the tax burden on smokers. We know the $73 million is only about 20 percent of the $500 million we need per year, so how would we raise enough to cover the remainder of the shortfall, increase taxes on drinkers?\par \par \uc2 Hmmm ...\par \par \uc2 --------\par \par \uc2 Columbus Telegram. Jan. 9, 2011\par \par \uc2 Political year brings hopes and concerns\par \par \uc2 The Legislature convened in Lincoln earlier this month with first-term Sen. Paul Schumacher among those being sworn in. He and his fellow senators face a tough 90 days of fiscal wrangling as a they attempt to find an answer to a budget shortfall in the $1 billion neighborhood.\par \par \uc2 Challenges along the way will include the governor's wish for no new taxes and continued strong support for the state's schools.\par \par \uc2 Schumacher and his fellow senators should keep a wary eye on Attorney General Jon Bruning. He is on one hand pressing a legislative agenda while busying his other hand with his planned race for the U.S. Senate. His proposals should be examined carefully for underlying political agendas.\par \par \uc2 Sen. Charlie Janssen, as promised, is bringing forth an Arizona-style \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  bill. We hope this inflammatory issue does not distract from more critical business.\par \par \uc2 The one issue we definitely want to receive attention is any move toward completing the four-lane road between Schuyler and Fremont. If any progress is made on that item, we will consider the session a success.\par \par \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Much is to be done in Nebraska, Platte County and Columbus this year. We believe the right people are in place to meet the challenge.\par \par \uc2 Onward and upward.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110114e71e0029g\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 HELENA, Mont. (AP) - Montana lawmakers tackled illegal immigration Friday, pushing forward a bill to ban illegal immigrants from receiving workers' compensation insurance benefits and hearing initial debate on a plan to turn to a federal immigration database before issuing Montana driver's licenses.\par \par \uc2 Staunch opponents to illegal immigration want the state to use that federal database to verify legal immigration status before issuing a driver's license.\par \par \uc2 Opponents of House Bill 178 argue the state would be subjecting its residents -- and control of its identification -- to a database that was central to the federal REAL ID program Montana overwhelmingly rejected.\par \par \uc2 Rep. David Howard, a Park City Republican and retired Federal Bureau of Investigation agent, said his proposed bill is an extra safeguard that is needed to make sure only people in the country legally get a driver's license.\par \par \uc2 Other supporters said illegal immigrants affect national security and other issues.\par \par \uc2 "They are slowly infiltrating the state of Montana," said Art Ellison, who testified with other members of the American Legion in support of the bill. "All of the Western states are inundated with the illegal immigrants."\par \par \uc2 The Department of Transportation said it favors the bill. Right now its agents have to individually analyze complicated immigration documents to determine legality. Those agents could now rely on the "federal systematic alien verification for entitlements program."\par \par \uc2 Opponents said it is wrong to specify the use of the federal database in state law. They said it could be inaccurate, pointing to past problems in federal agencies, and lead to lengthy delays for Montanans legally requesting a driver's license.\par \par \uc2 The argued that no \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who has to cross dangerous borders and risk everything to get into the country is going to be stopped by the threat of not being able to get a driver's license. The roads will be more dangerous because such immigrants won't have licenses or insurance under the plan.\par \par \uc2 The House Transportation Committee didn't take an immediate vote on the plan.\par \par \uc2 A different panel, the House Judiciary Committee, endorsed a measure to ban illegal immigrants from collecting workers' compensation benefits.\par \par \uc2 Backers of the proposal said it is needed to send a message to those wrongly employing illegal immigrants. Opponents countered that the workers will still get injured, and hospitals will be left picking up the tab for treating them in emergencies.\par \par \uc2 The politically charged arguments surround a perceived problem that could be very small -- or even nonexistent.\par \par \uc2 The Montana State Fund reported to legislative staff that in 2010, it could only find eight claims out of more than 8,000 that had a suspicious Social Security number that may indicate an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Jorge Quintana, a Helena lawyer who said he is of Cuban ancestry and speaks Spanish, said he practiced for years as a prosecutor and only once ever came across an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  needing a translator in the justice system.\par \par \uc2 "This is an out-of-state solution to a problem we simply don't have," Quintana said.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110114e71e001rl\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) - The Kentucky Senate's top Republican and the House Democratic budget chief staked out sharply different stands on education, immigration and tax modernization bills at a joint appearance Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 In a flurry of opening-week action, the GOP-led Senate passed bills promoting neighborhood schools, giving police broad authority to crack down on illegal immigration and creating a commission to work on rewriting the state tax code.\par \par \uc2 Those measures now go to the House, where Democrats hold sway. The General Assembly reconvenes in February.\par \par \uc2 House budget committee Chairman Rick Rand, D-Bedford, criticized the three measures during a joint appearance with Senate President David Williams before the Louisville Forum, a nonpartisan public issues group.\par \par \uc2 Afterward, Rand said the chance for an impasse exists on those issues in a session that lasts 30 working days.\par \par \uc2 "It's going to be depending on how willing the Senate is to compromise on anything," he said. "Obviously, we're not going to pass any of them as they are. We're just going to have to wait and see."\par \par \uc2 Rand said gubernatorial politics loom as a big issue in the legislative session. Williams is seeking the GOP nomination for governor, while Democratic Gov. Steve Beshear is running for a second term.\par \par \uc2 "It's going to be a factor, and I'm not saying it's going to be a negative factor -- we don't know," Rand said in his opening remarks. "It's going to be incumbent on us in the House to work with Sen. Williams as much as we can to help push forward an agenda that will help continue to move Kentucky forward."\par \par \uc2 Williams didn't tout his candidacy during the event, but he jabbed at Beshear for not pushing for tax modernization and for proposing a state budget last year based partly on revenue from legalizing slot machines at tracks, an idea that died.\par \par \uc2 On immigration, Rand warned that the Senate-passed measure could lead to a national backlash hurting Kentucky's tourism and convention business. He also worried the measure would saddle local jails with higher costs from additional inmates.\par \par \uc2 "I think it would be wrong for us to pass an Arizona-style immigration bill," Rand said. "I think it would be terrible public relations for Kentucky and would be virtually impossible to enforce."\par \par \uc2 Williams said Kentucky risks becoming a "sanctuary state" for illegal immigrants if other states enact tougher enforcement laws. He said illegal aliens strain social services, health care and education.\par \par \uc2 "All those things collectively cry out for addressing the immigration issue," he said.\par \par \uc2 The Senate proposal would allow police to arrest illegal immigrants on trespassing charges for setting foot in Kentucky. It would allow Kentucky law enforcement officers to determine the immigration status of someone who is stopped for another reason, such as a traffic offense, and who is suspected of being an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Rand said House Democrats intend to pass a measure to require that anyone doing business with the state verify they have no undocumented workers on their payroll. Williams criticized it as "punitive" action against employers.\par \par \uc2 On education, Williams promoted a Senate-passed bill aimed at allowing children to attend the public school closest to their homes. The legislation, in part, is a reaction to criticism of a new elementary student-assignment plan in Jefferson County, the state's largest public school district.\par \par \uc2 Williams said the bill would give parents needed "leverage" in deciding where their children attend school. Rand responded that the bill would erode local school board authority and said it faces "tough sledding" in the House.\par \par \uc2 Williams countered that the bill would maintain local control.\par \par \uc2 "This is an attempt to keep an intervention from Frankfort from happening," he told reporters afterward. "Right now when you have failed schools, the state Department of Education comes and intervenes."\par \par \uc2 During the event, Williams said the Jefferson County school board is "owned and run" by the local teachers association. "There have to be some changes here," he said.\par \par \uc2 Brent McKim, president of the Jefferson County Teachers Association, was in the audience and later told reporters that Williams was pushing the bill for political motives.\par \par \uc2 "It's really playing politics with the legitimate frustration that some parents have because they would have preferred their child to have been in another school," McKim said.\par \par \uc2 Rand also criticized another of Williams' priorities -- a Senate-passed bill to create an outside commission on revamping the state tax code. The measure would limit lawmakers to an up-or-down vote on any tax modernization plan crafted by the group of economists and other tax experts, without the ability to make substantive changes.\par \par \uc2 Williams said the bill is a response to a state tax system that impedes economic growth, and to the unwillingness of the governor and House Democrats to deal with the issue.\par \par \uc2 "People need to lead, follow or get out of the way on this issue," Williams said.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110112e71c001z5\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) - The Kentucky Senate's top Republican and the House Democratic budget chief staked out sharply different stands on education, immigration and tax modernization bills at a joint appearance Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 In a flurry of opening-week action, the GOP-led Senate passed bills promoting neighborhood schools, giving police broad authority to crack down on illegal immigration and creating a commission to work on rewriting the state tax code.\par \par \uc2 Those measures now go to the House, where Democrats hold sway. The General Assembly reconvenes in February.\par \par \uc2 House budget committee Chairman Rick Rand, D-Bedford, criticized the three measures during a joint appearance with Senate President David Williams before the Louisville Forum, a nonpartisan public issues group.\par \par \uc2 Afterward, Rand said the chance for an impasse exists on those issues in a session that lasts 30 working days.\par \par \uc2 "It's going to be depending on how willing the Senate is to compromise on anything," he said. "Obviously, we're not going to pass any of them as they are. We're just going to have to wait and see."\par \par \uc2 Rand said gubernatorial politics loom as a big issue in the legislative session. Williams is seeking the GOP nomination for governor, while Democratic Gov. Steve Beshear is running for a second term.\par \par \uc2 "It's going to be a factor, and I'm not saying it's going to be a negative factor -- we don't know," Rand said in his opening remarks. "It's going to be incumbent on us in the House to work with Sen. Williams as much as we can to help push forward an agenda that will help continue to move Kentucky forward."\par \par \uc2 Williams didn't tout his candidacy during the event, but he jabbed at Beshear for not pushing for tax modernization and for proposing a state budget last year based partly on revenue from legalizing slot machines at tracks, an idea that died.\par \par \uc2 On immigration, Rand warned that the Senate-passed measure could lead to a national backlash hurting Kentucky's tourism and convention business. He also worried the measure would saddle local jails with higher costs from additional inmates.\par \par \uc2 "I think it would be wrong for us to pass an Arizona-style immigration bill," Rand said. "I think it would be terrible public relations for Kentucky and would be virtually impossible to enforce."\par \par \uc2 Williams said Kentucky risks becoming a "sanctuary state" for illegal immigrants if other states enact tougher enforcement laws. He said illegal aliens strain social services, health care and education.\par \par \uc2 "All those things collectively cry out for addressing the immigration issue," he said.\par \par \uc2 The Senate proposal would allow police to arrest illegal immigrants on trespassing charges for setting foot in Kentucky. It would allow Kentucky law enforcement officers to determine the immigration status of someone who is stopped for another reason, such as a traffic offense, and who is suspected of being an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Rand said House Democrats intend to pass a measure to require that anyone doing business with the state verify they have no undocumented workers on their payroll. Williams criticized it as "punitive" action against employers.\par \par \uc2 On education, Williams promoted a Senate-passed bill aimed at allowing children to attend the public school closest to their homes. The legislation, in part, is a reaction to criticism of a new elementary student-assignment plan in Jefferson County, the state's largest public school district.\par \par \uc2 Williams said the bill would give parents needed "leverage" in deciding where their children attend school. Rand responded that the bill would erode local school board authority and said it faces "tough sledding" in the House.\par \par \uc2 Williams countered that the bill would maintain local control.\par \par \uc2 "This is an attempt to keep an intervention from Frankfort from happening," he told reporters afterward. "Right now when you have failed schools, the state Department of Education comes and intervenes."\par \par \uc2 During the event, Williams said the Jefferson County school board is "owned and run" by the local teachers association. "There have to be some changes here," he said.\par \par \uc2 Brent McKim, president of the Jefferson County Teachers Association, was in the audience and later told reporters that Williams was pushing the bill for political motives.\par \par \uc2 "It's really playing politics with the legitimate frustration that some parents have because they would have preferred their child to have been in another school," McKim said.\par \par \uc2 Rand also criticized another of Williams' priorities -- a Senate-passed bill to create an outside commission on revamping the state tax code. The measure would limit lawmakers to an up-or-down vote on any tax modernization plan crafted by the group of economists and other tax experts, without the ability to make substantive changes.\par \par \uc2 Williams said the bill is a response to a state tax system that impedes economic growth, and to the unwillingness of the governor and House Democrats to deal with the issue.\par \par \uc2 "People need to lead, follow or get out of the way on this issue," Williams said.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110112e71c001pp\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

(AP) - Jury selection began Monday in the trial of three former police officers who are charged with obstructing the investigation into the fatal beating of an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Mexico.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors accuse former Shenandoah police Chief Matthew Nestor and two of his subordinates of orchestrating a cover-up that protected high school football players involved in the death of 25-year-old Luis Ramirez.\par \par \uc2 The officers have pleaded not guilty.\par \par \uc2 Ramirez was knocked unconscious and kicked in the head as he fought with a group of white teenagers walking home from a block party late on July 12, 2008. Ramirez, a native of the small central Mexican town of Iramuco, died two days later of his injuries.\par \par \uc2 Two men who took part in the assault were convicted in October of a federal hate crime. Derrick Donchak, 20, and Brandon Piekarsky, 19, face a maximum of life in prison when they are sentenced later this month.\par \par \uc2 All three officers had close ties to the assailants.\par \par \uc2 Patrolman Jason Hayes dated Piekarsky's mother. Lt. William Moyer's son played with Piekarsky on the football team. Their commanding officer, Nestor, was a friend of Piekarsky's mother and vacationed with her, according to court documents.\par \par \uc2 The officers tried to "impede, obstruct and influence the investigation" into the beating death by tampering with evidence and witnesses or lying to the FBI, according to an indictment.\par \par \uc2 Hayes' attorney, Frank Nocito, said Monday that Schuylkill County District Attorney James Goodman may be called as a witness, according to the Republican-Herald of Pottsville.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Information from: Pottsville Republican-Herald, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.republicanherald.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.republicanherald.com}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110110e71a001eo\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

Senate passes crackdown on illegal immigrants\b0\par\par\uc2 By BRUCE SCHREINER   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 484 \uc2 words\par \uc2 7 January 2011\par 17:26\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2011.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) - Kentucky senators voted Friday to enlist law enforcement in a stepped-up fight against illegal immigration by passing a bill that would give police broad authority to check the immigration status of people they stop.\par \par \uc2 Critics said the bill is tougher than a similar Arizona immigration law that has drawn boycotts and legal challenges, and they warned it would strain crowded Kentucky jails and prisons at enormous expense.\par \par \uc2 The measure cleared the Kentucky Senate on a 24-14 vote after supporters said it would signal the state's willingness to combat the influx of illegal immigrants. They argued illegal immigrants sap government services and ignore the rule of law.\par \par \uc2 The bill was among the top priorities of Republicans who run the Senate.\par \par \uc2 "Does Kentucky want to be a sanctuary for illegals?" said Sen. Tom Jensen, R-London. "What this bill really does is it sends a message ... that we do not tolerate people coming into this country illegally. They should come into this country legally. My grandparents did."\par \par \uc2 The bill now heads to the Democratic-led state House, where its fate is uncertain.\par \par \uc2 The measure would allow Kentucky law enforcement officers to determine the immigration status of someone who is stopped for another reason, such as a traffic offense, and who is suspected of being an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The proposal also would allow police to arrest illegal immigrants on trespassing charges for setting foot in Kentucky.\par \par \uc2 Supporters voiced frustration with the federal government's inability to stop the ongoing tide of illegal immigration and said Kentucky should take the initiative.\par \par \uc2 "People that come (into this country), we ought to expect them to be proud to be Americans, and they've got to follow the law," Jensen said. "We expect it of Americans. Why wouldn't we expect it of illegals in here?"\par \par \uc2 Sen. Jerry Rhoads, D-Madionsville, agreed that illegal immigration is a pressing problem, but warned that with such a response, "are we going to create another crisis? Are we going to exacerbate our current fiscal crisis?"\par \par \uc2 He warned the bill would put a greater burden on crowded jails and prisons at great expense to the state and local governments.\par \par \uc2 Sen. John Schickel, the bill's sponsor, said state and local law enforcement would have the leeway to transport an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  to federal authorities "without ever going to a county jail, without ever even going to a police station."\par \par \uc2 Rhoads also said law enforcement officers already have the authority to check someone's legal status.\par \par \uc2 "When you're stopped for speeding, what's the first thing that's checked? Your ID, who are you, where are you from, where do you live, what is your status. We don't need another law to authorize our peace officers to check ID."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 The legislation is Senate Bill 6.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110107e7170003w\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

Senate panel OKs proposal to allow police to check immigration status of people they stop\b0\par\par\uc2 By BRUCE SCHREINER   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 531 \uc2 words\par \uc2 6 January 2011\par 15:39\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2011.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) - Kentucky lawmakers took a first step Thursday toward a crackdown on illegal immigrants, advancing a bill that would give police broad authority to check the immigration status of people they stop.\par \par \uc2 In its first test of support, the measure cleared the Senate Judiciary Committee on an 8-3 vote after a lengthy discussion in which one opponent branded it as a "12th century bill of rights."\par \par \uc2 The bill now heads to the full Senate, where it has the support of Republican leaders who set the chamber's agenda. The legislation is an outgrowth of a controversial Arizona immigration law that is facing legal challenge.\par \par \uc2 The Kentucky rendition would allow law enforcement officers to determine the immigration status of someone when "reasonable suspicion" exists that the person is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The proposal would allow police to arrest illegal immigrants on trespassing charges for setting foot in Kentucky.\par \par \uc2 That tough approach was hailed by northern Kentucky tea party activist Jim Dugan, who told the committee: "These are people that commit criminal acts. So how you can defend criminals is beyond me."\par \par \uc2 Sen. John Schickel, the bill's sponsor, said Kentuckians shouldn't suffer from the federal government's inability or unwillingness to fully enforce immigration laws.\par \par \uc2 "It puts the heat on the federal government to respond to this crisis that we have," said Schickel, R-Union.\par \par \uc2 Supporters said the influx of illegal immigrants causes a drain on education and social services.\par \par \uc2 There's a cost to individuals as well, they said. People pay higher health insurance bills to offset the health costs of uninsured illegal immigrants, while some are involved in auto wrecks with uninsured illegal immigrants, they said.\par \par \uc2 "There's a tremendous amount of death and maiming and hurt and harm to American citizens from illegal aliens," said Douglas Roy, president of Kentuckians for Immigration Reform and Enforcement.\par \par \uc2 Opponents called the bill an intrusion into a federal issue that would saddle the state prison system and local governments with more expenses. One critic flatly said the measure was politically motivated.\par \par \uc2 "I don't see the rush here other than an election coming up," Clark said.\par \par \uc2 The bill is supported by Senate President David Williams, R-Burkesville, who is running for governor this year.\par \par \uc2 "This is like the 12th century bill of rights," Clark said while railing against the bill. "... We're doing this on ancedotal evidence, we're doing this on fear."\par \par \uc2 Marilyn Daniel, an immigration attorney from Lexington, said Kentucky's image would take a beating from such a law.\par \par \uc2 Arizona was hit by boycotts brought on by its immigration crackdown. A report late last year said the boycott had cost the state $141 million in lost meeting and convention business since April, when the law was signed by the state's governor.\par \par \uc2 "In an economic downturn, Kentucky does not deserve the kind of publicity and national notice that will come with the passage of a bill like this," Daniel said. "So I ask you, please don't do that to us at this time."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110106e716002ny\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

Senate panel OKs proposal to allow police to check immigration status of people they stop\b0\par\par\uc2 By BRUCE SCHREINER   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 537 \uc2 words\par \uc2 6 January 2011\par 15:34\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2011.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) - Kentucky lawmakers took a first step Thursday toward a crackdown on illegal immigrants, advancing a bill that would give police broad authority to check the immigration status of people they stop.\par \par \uc2 In its first test of support, the measure cleared the Senate Judiciary Committee on an 8-3 vote after a lengthy discussion in which one opponent branded it as a "12th century bill of rights."\par \par \uc2 The bill now heads to the full Senate, where it has the support of Republican leaders who set the chamber's agenda. The legislation is an outgrowth of a controversial Arizona immigration law that is facing legal challenge.\par \par \uc2 The Kentucky rendition would allow law enforcement officers to determine the immigration status of someone when "reasonable suspicion" exists that the person is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The proposal would allow police to arrest illegal immigrants on trespassing charges for setting foot in Kentucky.\par \par \uc2 That tough approach was hailed by northern Kentucky tea party activist Jim Dugan, who told the committee: "These are people that commit criminal acts. So how you can defend criminals is beyond me."\par \par \uc2 Sen. John Schickel, the bill's sponsor, said Kentuckians shouldn't suffer from the federal government's inability or unwillingness to fully enforce immigration laws.\par \par \uc2 "It puts the heat on the federal government to respond to this crisis that we have," said Schickel, R-Union.\par \par \uc2 Supporters said the influx of illegal immigrants causes a drain on education and social services.\par \par \uc2 There's a cost to individuals as well, they said. People pay higher health insurance bills to offset the health costs of uninsured illegal immigrants, while some are involved in auto wrecks with uninsured illegal immigrants, they said.\par \par \uc2 "There's a tremendous amount of death and maiming and hurt and harm to American citizens from illegal aliens," said Douglas Roy, president of Kentuckians for Immigration Reform and Enforcement.\par \par \uc2 Opponents called the bill an intrusion into a federal issue that would saddle the state prison system and local governments with more expenses. One critic flatly said the measure was politically motivated.\par \par \uc2 "I don't see the rush here other than an election coming up," Clark said.\par \par \uc2 The bill is supported by Senate President David Williams, R-Burkesville, who is running for governor this year.\par \par \uc2 "This is like the 12th century bill of rights," Clark said while railing against the bill. "... We're doing this on ancedotal evidence, we're doing this on fear."\par \par \uc2 Marilyn Daniel, an immigration attorney from Lexington, said Kentucky's image would take a beating from such a law.\par \par \uc2 Arizona was hit by boycotts brought on by its immigration crackdown. A report late last year said the boycott had cost the state $141 million in lost meeting and convention business since April, when the law was signed by the state's governor.\par \par \uc2 "In an economic downturn, Kentucky does not deserve the kind of publicity and national notice that will come with the passage of a bill like this," Daniel said. "So I ask you, please don't do that to us at this time."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 The legislation is Senate Bill 6.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110106e716002bv\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

BECK   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 636 \uc2 words\par \uc2 6 January 2011\par 13:25\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2011.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) - State Sen. Charlie Janssen introduced a statewide illegal immigration measure, reminiscent of one passed last year in Arizona, on Thursday -- the first day of bill introduction in the 2011 legislative session.\par \par \uc2 Janssen had promised since May -- just weeks after the Arizona law passed -- that he would introduce the contentious measure this session, despite lawmakers' already onerous load to close a massive budget gap and redraw political district boundaries over the next 90 days.\par \par \uc2 "This bill is meant to stop illegal immigration and protect the citizens of the state of Nebraska in several ways," Janssen said Thursday. "It will protect the taxpayers from having to pay for the education, welfare and medical expenses of illegal aliens."\par \par \uc2 Joining Janssen for the announcement was Nebraska Attorney General Jon Bruning, who for months has worked with Janssen to help craft the measure in an effort to strengthen it against court challenges.\par \par \uc2 Like Arizona's law, Janssen's bill would require police officers, when enforcing other laws, to question the immigration status of those they suspect are in the country illegally. It would also require non-U.S. citizens to carry documents showing their legal status. Failure to do so would be a misdemeanor.\par \par \uc2 The measure also criminalizes harboring, hiding or transporting an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . Violation of that would be a misdemeanor.\par \par \uc2 Critics say the Arizona law encourages racial profiling. A federal judge blocked sections of the law in July, including provisions calling for police to check a person's immigration status while enforcing other laws and requiring immigrants to prove they are in the United States legally.\par \par \uc2 Janssen's measure differs from the Arizona law in that it does not allow law enforcement to make warrantless arrests of suspected illegal immigrants. Bruning said the Nebraska measure also specifically addresses the issue of profiling by stating "a peace officer's reasonable suspicion shall not be based solely upon a person's race, color, religion, sex or national origin."\par \par \uc2 Bruning said Nebraska is one of 21 states considering similar legislation this year.\par \par \uc2 "Illegal immigration is a problem in every state," said Bruning, a Republican who announced on Wednesday his candidacy for U.S. Senate in 2012. "The way I see it, the federal government needs the help. The federal government is not getting the job done."\par \par \uc2 There has been a steady stream of Hispanics moving into Nebraska since the early 1990s, with many working in the meatpacking industry. They now account for about 8 percent of the state's population. From 2000 to 2008, Hispanics were responsible for about 64 percent of the state's population growth.\par \par \uc2 Janssen's district includes Fremont, home of two meatpacking plants and where voters in June approved an ordinance barring landlords from renting to illegal immigrants and businesses from hiring them.\par \par \uc2 The Fremont law was supposed to take effect in July, but the American Civil Liberties Union of Nebraska and the Mexican American Legal Defense & Educational Fund sued to get it thrown out, contending that the ordinance is discriminatory and contrary to state law.\par \par \uc2 Janssen's bill could find support in the conservative, though nonpartisan, one-house Legislature. Republican Gov. Dave Heineman has said he would support a state measure similar to Arizona's.\par \par \uc2 But Janssen's proposal must pass through the Legislature's Judiciary Committee before the full Legislature can vote on it. The committee's chairman, state Sen. Brad Ashford of Omaha, has said he won't support such a measure. Another committee member, state Sen. Brenda Council of Omaha, has also said she would not support the measure.\par \par \uc2 At least one committee member, state Sen. Mark Christensen of Imperial, has said he would support Janssen's bill.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Online:\par \par \uc2 Nebraska Legislature: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://nebraskalegislature.gov/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://nebraskalegislature.gov/}}}\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Online:\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://nebraskalegislature.gov/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://nebraskalegislature.gov/}}}\par \par \uc2 5\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110106e7160025g\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SEATTLE (AP) - Charlie Wiggins has been known to spend his free time searching the Bible for references to "justice" and re-enacting the state Constitutional Convention in costume.\par \par \uc2 Needless to say, he considers his new seat on Washington's Supreme Court a dream job.\par \par \uc2 The bow-tied, 63-year-old appeals lawyer from Bainbridge Island is being sworn in Friday at the Temple of Justice in Olympia. He beat three-term Justice Richard Sanders by 13,000 votes out of nearly 2 million cast.\par \par \uc2 "He's a scholar, he's a teacher, he's an advocate for the public good," says his friend John Ruhl, the former president of the King County Bar Association. "He's going in there to be now a part of something he has done so much to learn about."\par \par \uc2 Wiggins is recognized in legal circles for his sharp grasp of the law, his efforts to strengthen judicial ethics and his eloquent writing. He organized an "urban people's law school" to teach residents of Seattle's Central District about practical legal concepts and traveled to Albania to advise judicial officers there in the aftermath of communism's fall.\par \par \uc2 But he understands he won the election largely because of who he wasn't.\par \par \uc2 Sanders had a history of controversial remarks. Just before the election, The Seattle Times retracted its endorsement of him over recent comments he made rejecting the notion that systemic bias is part of the reason certain minority groups are overrepresented in the prison population.\par \par \uc2 Sanders carried most of the state, but Wiggins, considered a moderate by lawyers who have followed him, won handily in populous, left-leaning Seattle and King County.\par \par \uc2 Wiggins is eager now to show the voters whom they elected.\par \par \uc2 The son of a soldier, he spent parts of his childhood in Alabama, New York, France and Venezuela. Religion was an important part of his upbringing, and it remains central to his life -- helping shape his thoughts on justice, though not, he says, his understanding of what the law requires of in any given case. His mother was a Presbyterian, his father was a Southern Baptist, and he frequently attended services at nondenominational Army chapels.\par \par \uc2 He spent two years at Wheaton College, a conservative evangelical school in Illinois. The certitude of many there, who insisted people must either accept Jesus or suffer damnation, turned him off, and he entered a period of doubt that ended only with his father's sudden death.\par \par \uc2 He has served on the board of elders at his Presbyterian church on Bainbridge Island, has taught adult Sunday school classes and has incorporated ministries in Seattle. In 1990, using software his wife gave him that allowed him to search the text of the Bible, he began an informal study of biblical justice.\par \par \uc2 "Justice in biblical terms consists of bringing broken relationships back into balance -- restoring harmony," he says. "I think we're called on to do justice as a personal matter as well as a civic matter.\par \par \uc2 "Now whatever that may require -- the content of legal obligations -- you don't find it in the Bible. A judge finds it in the law and the Constitution."\par \par \uc2 Wiggins says he probably would have sided with the majority in the 2006 ruling upholding the state's ban on gay marriage. But he also says that in light of a federal judge in San Francisco ruling the U.S. ban unconstitutional, he would have to reconsider whether there's any rationale for such laws.\par \par \uc2 He has supported Equal Rights Washington, attending the group's annual dinner auction last year and spending $80 to win the privilege of going to a gun range with pro-gay-rights Republican legal activist Alex Hays.\par \par \uc2 In its evaluation of Wiggins before the election, Hays' group, Justice for Washington, said it had concerns that he is tied to the state's Democratic establishment. But it also said Wiggins would be one of the court's more competent members if elected.\par \par \uc2 After Wheaton, Wiggins attended Princeton University on a ROTC scholarship, majored in philosophy and joined the Army. He attended night business classes while stationed in Hawaii and became so interested in business law that he decided to go to law school, graduating from Duke University in 1976 and joining a Seattle firm where he specialized in appeals work.\par \par \uc2 He enjoyed the intellectual rigor -- the research, analysis and variety -- involved in appeals cases, which he found more pleasant than hardball trial advocacy.\par \par \uc2 Around the time of Washington's centennial in 1989, he began researching the state's Constitutional Convention for a series of articles on the delegates and their debates. Though the state paid to have court reporters at the convention, it never paid them to make transcripts of their shorthand notes, which were eventually destroyed. Wiggins spent hours digging through old newspaper clippings on microfilm to research the convention.\par \par \uc2 He and now-Justice Gerry Alexander have re-enacted the debates for legal audiences, with Wiggins breaking out a strong brogue to portray a delegate nicknamed "the thrifty Scotsman of Ritzville."\par \par \uc2 "We wore costumes -- the stovepipe hats and cutaway coats," Alexander recalled. "It's fun to know about the history of the Constitutional Convention, but it's also important. People get fired up about the federal Constitution, but they forget about the state Constitution, and there's a lot more in it."\par \par \uc2 Wiggins was appointed to fill Alexander's seat on the state appeals court in the mid-1990s when Alexander joined the high court, but he lost a special election and returned to private practice.\par \par \uc2 Among his proudest legal accomplishments, he says, was representing Jesse Magana, who was paralyzed when the seat-back of his Hyundai collapsed during an accident. After more than a decade of litigation, the state Supreme Court -- in a 2009 opinion by Sanders -- reinstated an $8 million default verdict against the company for failing to turn over documents.\par \par \uc2 In another case, Wiggins represented Alex Salas, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  injured in an on-the-job construction accident. When Salas sued the company, a judge allowed the company to introduce evidence of his immigration status, and Salas lost. The Supreme Court reversed the decision, saying the evidence should have been excluded because it was too prejudicial.\par \par \uc2 He has served on a variety of state bar and court rules committees. A critic of judicial elections, he helped create the Website {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.votingforjudges.org"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.votingforjudges.org}}}\uc2  to help voters learn about judges, and he testified before the Legislature in favor of limits on judicial campaign contributions.\par \par \uc2 In 2008, he wrote a friend-of-the-court brief to the U.S. Supreme Court on behalf of more than two dozen former justices from 19 states, arguing that a judge in West Virginia should have recused himself from a case involving \uc2 Massey Energy\uc2  after the company spent $3 million to get him elected. The high court agreed.\par \par \uc2 Wiggins says he has some ideas for improving the work of the state's court, primarily by forging broader consensus. Too many decisions are splintered among dissenting and concurring opinions that can leave lawyers and lower court judges scratching their heads. He also believes the court would be better prepared for arguments if justices met to discuss cases ahead of time.\par \par \uc2 Administrative law Judge Anita Crawford-Willis met Wiggins when they organized the "urban people's law school" together.\par \par \uc2 "He cares about our community as a whole and people who are less fortunate. He cares about access to justice," she says. "His whole career has shown that tendency in the things he's done outside his legal work. The people at the top of your court system, you want them to believe in that and be committed to that."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110106e7160017g\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

WEBER   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 946 \uc2 words\par \uc2 6 January 2011\par 03:50\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2011.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 AUSTIN, Texas (AP) - Illegal immigration isn't on the short list of issues Texas sheriffs gave this year's Legislature, but it could end up becoming a new priority for them.\par \par \uc2 Texas has 254 sheriffs, and while opinions vary about whether illegal immigration should be their problem, some Republicans are pushing measures that won't give them a choice. More than a dozen bills targeting illegal immigration await the Legislature when it convenes Tuesday, when the GOP will enter with a historic conservative supermajority in the House.\par \par \uc2 One bill would require police to ask drivers without identification if they're in the country legally. Another would cut off state funds to departments that don't enforce immigrations laws.\par \par \uc2 "It's split among my colleagues on whether we should be out here just stopping individuals without probable cause, and questioning them on their immigration status," said Travis County Sheriff Greg Hamilton, who believes the proposals invite profiling.\par \par \uc2 On Thursday, El Paso County Sheriff Richard Wiles planned to join immigrant advocacy groups at the Capitol, where they're expected to denounce bills targeting illegal immigrants as bad for the Texas economy and constitutionally unworkable.\par \par \uc2 In Arizona, a new law passed last year requires police officers, when enforcing other laws, to question the immigration status of those they suspect are in the country illegally. The Obama administration filed a lawsuit to block portions of the law, and the outcome remains pending in federal court.\par \par \uc2 Many Texas sheriffs along the border, long vocal about being understaffed and underfunded on the edge of Mexico's violent drug war, oppose the measures as another drain on their deputies. They and sheriffs in Houston and San Antonio also worry about profiling.\par \par \uc2 Others don't see it as an imposition, and maybe a necessity. In Fort Bend County, which includes Houston's conservative suburbs, Sheriff Milton Wright said he would support laws requiring his deputies to enforce immigration laws if the federal government won't.\par \par \uc2 "If they're not going to do it, then we need to," he said.\par \par \uc2 Arizona's new law left Texas facing unavoidable questions. Texas has an estimated 1.6 million illegal immigrants, second only to California, and Republicans control every statewide office. Gov. Rick Perry has said he doesn't support Texas adopting a law identical to Arizona's, while at the same time praising that state's initiative for taking the illegal immigration problem into its own hands.\par \par \uc2 Texas lawmakers have filed immigration bills before, only to see them wither. Deep ties Texas has to Mexico are as much cultural as economic, and leading business groups in the state oppose tough crackdown measures.\par \par \uc2 But between then new GOP supermajority in the House and Arizona's success, outnumbered Texas Democrats aren't willing to make wagers on the chances of the bills prevailing this time.\par \par \uc2 "You've got a bunch of new Republicans who campaigned with some very inflammatory rhetoric, and they now find themselves in charge," said Democratic Rep. Rafael Anchia. "I'm sure they're going to want to deliver some red meat for some of their constituencies."\par \par \uc2 So important is the issue to state Rep. Debbie Riddle that she camped outside the clerk's window to ensure her get-tough immigration bills would be first in line. State Sen. Dan Patrick filed a bill that would require police to ask anyone without an ID whether they're in the country illegally, but the Houston-area talk radio host says his measure affords officer discretion. For instance, he said an officer could choose not to arrest a harmless minivan-driving mom who is revealed to be an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Patrick, who visited Arizona to see its new law in action, said the possibility of legal challenges is no barrier.\par \par \uc2 "Too many people want to duck and cover and bury their heads in the sand," Patrick said. "This is an issue we have to stand tall on. Republicans have to stand together."\par \par \uc2 In most Texas counties, a suspect's legal status becomes an issue only if they're booked into jail. Their fingerprints are run through a Homeland Security database, and people who are flagged are referred to federal immigration agents.\par \par \uc2 Harris County was the first place in the nation to try the federal program, called Secure Communities. But that's about the extent that Sheriff Adrian Garcia wants to be involved in immigration enforcement.\par \par \uc2 Garcia said he doesn't want people afraid of calling police for help or coming forward with crime tips.\par \par \uc2 "Legislation that would encourage people to have second thoughts about calling 911 or Crime Stoppers, I have a problem with that," he said.\par \par \uc2 Several sheriffs said they would wait for the Sheriffs' Association of Texas to evaluate the proposals. Bryan County Sheriff Christopher Kirk, who chairs the association's legislative committee, said last month he had yet to look over the bills individually.\par \par \uc2 The association gave its list of six priorities to lawmakers for this session. The list includes jail overcrowding, mentally ill suspects in local lockups, methamphetamines, thieves swiping salvage metals, and what Kirk described as "protecting the office of sheriff."\par \par \uc2 Topping the list: border security. But Kirk said that's not about illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 "It's the trafficking. The borders. That smuggling could be drugs, or weapons," Kirk said.\par \par \uc2 During the previous two legislative sessions, Patrick said "too much chaos" in the House doomed immigration proposals. This time, Patrick said, Republicans have the numbers -- and a willingness to work with law enforcement.\par \par \uc2 "You have to have their buy-in," Patrick said. "I want them to be enthusiastic about it."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110106e71600134\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ATLANTA (AP) - A key Georgia lawmaker said Wednesday the state should consider legislation that could keep the children of illegal immigrants born in the United States from being granted automatic citizenship.\par \par \uc2 State Sen. Jack Murphy, co-chair of a legislative committee on immigration, was one of a group of state legislators from around the country who met in Washington on Wednesday to discuss a plan to challenge automatic citizenship for infants born in the U.S. to illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 "The anchor baby loophole has grown to such large proportions that our state and our nation can no longer afford to ignore it," Murphy, a Republican from Cumming, said in a statement. "Members of our committee must begin to look at legislation that will close these loopholes in Georgia and protect our citizens."\par \par \uc2 Seen for years as a fringe issue, challenging automatic citizenship has recently gained momentum among GOP lawmakers at the state and national levels. With conservatives gaining seats in November in many statehouses around the country, tough illegal immigration measures are expected to be introduced as state legislatures convene this year.\par \par \uc2 The term "anchor baby" refers to children born in the U.S. to at least one \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  parent. Immigrant rights and civil liberties groups say the term is offensive and have blasted the state legislators' plan. Such children don't provide their parents immunity from deportation, but once they turn 21 they can petition for their parents to receive green cards.\par \par \uc2 "We do hope that the Georgia lawmakers would stand up and reject this blatantly unconstitutional and discriminatory attempt because it clearly subverts the Constitution and would basically create a caste system," said Azadeh Shahshahani of the American Civil Liberties Union of Georgia.\par \par \uc2 The lawmakers who met in Washington are part of a group called State Legislators for Legal Immigration, founded by Pennsylvania State Representative Daryl D. Metcalfe. The group's website said those in attendance Wednesday included state legislators from Arizona, South Carolina and Oklahoma.\par \par \uc2 The lawmakers said their plan would not lead to the deportation of children born to illegal immigrants in the U.S. They said their ambition is to get the U.S. Supreme Court to rule on whether the 14th Amendment of the Constitution guarantees citizenship to such children.\par \par \uc2 The lawmakers want states to adopt a bill that would bestow state citizenship on people who meet the state's definition of a U.S. citizen and are state residents. They also want states to agree to a compact that defines who is eligible for U.S. citizenship.\par \par \uc2 The lawmakers say Congress must approve the compact but it does not require the president's signature.\par \par \uc2 Automatic citizenship is enshrined in the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which says: "All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside." That provision, ratified in 1868, was drafted with freed slaves in mind.\par \par \uc2 Challengers say the 14th Amendment wording was never meant to automatically confer citizenship to children born to illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 As a member of Congress, Georgia Gov.-elect Nathan Deal, who takes office Monday, was an early and repeated sponsor of legislation that would deny automatic citizenship to the children born in the U.S. to illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110105e715002mp\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

Ritter to announce Colorado joining federal immigration fingerprint program\b0\par\par\uc2 By IVAN MORENO   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 728 \uc2 words\par \uc2 3 January 2011\par 17:49\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2011.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 DENVER (AP) - A federal program aimed at catching illegal immigrants by using their fingerprints when they're booked in jails is coming to Colorado, Gov. Bill Ritter is expected to announce Tuesday, despite opposition from advocacy groups who say the initiative is flawed.\par \par \uc2 Ritter, who's leaves office Jan. 11, decided to accept the rapidly expanding Secure Communities program but with some modifications, according to two officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak before the announcement.\par \par \uc2 Ritter's spokesman didn't immediately return a call and an e-mail seeking comment.\par \par \uc2 The program run by the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement uses fingerprints during jail bookings to determine a person's immigration status and whether they've been arrested before. The program works by referencing the prints against records from the FBI and Department of Homeland Security immigration.\par \par \uc2 The program is in place in 891 jurisdictions in 35 states, and ICE has said it hopes to have it at every jail by 2013. Some officials around the country have publicly denounced the program, however, saying it could lead to racial profiling and violates civil rights. But ICE has maintained that the majority of the jurisdictions have welcomed the program and are grateful to have a resource to fight illegal immigration at little or no additional cost to local communities.\par \par \uc2 ICE and supporters of the program have also denied that racial profiling exists because everyone who is arrested is screened.\par \par \uc2 In California, the Berkeley City Council last month adopted a resolution asking to opt out of the program, said Amy Ferrer, associate director with the Bill of Rights Defense Committee. Ferrer said Santa Clara also adopted an opt-out resolution and so has San Francisco, which got the program in the summer despite opposition from the sheriff. The Washington, D.C., City Council also blocked Secure Communities from being implemented.\par \par \uc2 "The fingerprints that are shared with ICE can end up causing people to be put in deportation proceedings or to be detained when they haven't actually committed a crime," Ferrer said, adding that domestic violence victims are at risk.\par \par \uc2 She said people can end up in deportation proceedings without being convicted of a crime, because the fingerprints are checked at the point of arrest. Groups have also said the program will make immigrants reluctant to report crimes.\par \par \uc2 Colorado officials became interested in Secure Communities after an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Guatemala with a long criminal record was accused of causing a car crash at a suburban Denver ice cream shop that killed two women in a truck and a 3-year-old in the store. Authorities said Francis M. Hernandez had stayed off ICE's radar because he conned police with 12 aliases and two different dates of birth. A task-force assembled after the crash recommended Secure Communities as a solution in January 2009.\par \par \uc2 Since then, dozens of groups have given Ritter feedback on how to implement the program, including advice to reject the program altogether. Denver City Council members, state lawmakers, Democratic U.S. Rep. Jared Polis, and the Mexican consulate in Denver all sent letters expressing concern about the program, as did the Colorado Bar Association, the Colorado Coalition Against Domestic Violence, the American Civil Liberties Union and the Colorado Criminal Defense Bar.\par \par \uc2 It wasn't immediately known what the modifications to the program are, but Colorado groups opposing Secure Communities previously said they wanted domestic violence victims to be protected, and they want a reporting requirement in place so ICE can track what happens to everyone who is screened and make sure the program is working without racial profiling.\par \par \uc2 In an e-mail obtained by The Associated Press in August, Ritter's deputy counsel, Michael Shea, said the proposed agreement between Colorado and ICE "would be unique to Colorado, and it would provide a mechanism for determining how the program is working."\par \par \uc2 Ritter's spokesman, Evan Dreyer, said at the time that the state was working to make modifications to the program based on suggestions from different groups.\par \par \uc2 "I think it's fair to say that we recognized very early on that there were going to be a few things that we would want to modify," Dreyer said in August.\par \par \uc2 5\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110103e7130039y\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

Debbe Leftwich turn themselves in on bribery charges\b0\par\par\uc2 By TIM TALLEY   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 636 \uc2 words\par \uc2 3 January 2011\par 17:34\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2011.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) - A member of the Oklahoma House and a former member of the state Senate made initial court appearances Monday on felony bribery charges in what prosecutors allege was a promise not to seek re-election in exchange for a newly created state job.\par \par \uc2 Rep. Randy Terrill, a Republican from Moore, and former Sen. Debbe Leftwich, a Democrat from Oklahoma City, made brief appearances before Oklahoma County Special Judge Russell Hall, who entered not guilty pleas on their behalf. Leftwich and Terrill were booked into the Oklahoma County jail earlier Monday. Both posted $2,000 bond and were released.\par \par \uc2 Terrill, best known as the author of Oklahoma's tough anti-\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  law adopted by the Legislature in 2007, is charged with offering a bribe for withdrawal of candidacy. Leftwich is accused of soliciting a bribe for withdrawal of candidacy. The judge ordered both to return to Special Judge Stephen Alcorn's courtroom on March 17 for a preliminary hearing conference in the case.\par \par \uc2 Following the hearing, Leftwich's attorney and Terrill said they have done nothing wrong and expect to be exonerated of the charges.\par \par \uc2 "I am not being targeted because of anything that I've done, because I haven't done anything," Terrill told reporters outside the courtroom alongside his attorney, Stephen Jones. "Rather, I am being charged because of who I am and what I believe. And that's something that every real conservative should find extremely troubling."\par \par \uc2 Terrill said he never offered or gave anything to Leftwich to withdraw as a candidate from last year's election and accused Oklahoma County District Attorney David Prater, a Democrat who filed the charges on Dec. 22, of being politically motivated.\par \par \uc2 "What we have here is actually a good old fashioned political persecution, not a criminal prosecution, by an overzealous and hyper partisan Democrat district attorney who has charged a non-existent crime," Terrill said. "I am 100 percent innocent of the charges which are absolutely, totally and completely without any factual or legal bearing."\par \par \uc2 Prater, who has said his job has nothing to do with politics, did not directly respond to Terrill's comments.\par \par \uc2 "There will be an appropriate time to talk about the case," the district attorney said.\par \par \uc2 Leftwich's attorney, Robert McCampbell, said he plans to file a motion to dismiss the charges.\par \par \uc2 "Sen. Leftwich has not done anything wrong," McCampbell said. Leftwich did not speak with reporters.\par \par \uc2 An affidavit filed in the case alleges that Terrill offered Leftwich a job at the state Medical Examiner's Office last year that paid $80,000 a year in exchange for her agreement not to seek re-election to her south Oklahoma City Senate seat so another state lawmaker, state Rep. Mike Christian, could run for the job.\par \par \uc2 Christian, R-Oklahoma City, was not charged with any crime and is listed as a witness for the prosecution.\par \par \uc2 The affidavit alleges that Terrill wrote a bill that would create the job of "transition coordinator" at the Medical Examiner's Office for Leftwich and used a separate bill to divert $90,000 to the office from a fund at the Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs Control.\par \par \uc2 If Leftwich had been employed for three years, her state pension benefits would have grown from $23,000 a year to $43,200, according to the affidavit.\par \par \uc2 Democratic Gov. Brad Henry vetoed both measures after the allegations first surfaced in June. Leftwich did not seek re-election, and Terrill and Christian both won re-election to their House seats.\par \par \uc2 Jones, Terrill's attorney, has suggested that Leftwich and Terrill were targeted by political enemies and for trying to clean up the scandal-plagued Medical Examiner's Office.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110103e713001vd\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) - As a Marine's father awaits deportation for being an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , U.S. immigration officials are giving him a chance to prove he should be granted permanent residency in the United States.\par \par \uc2 "We're just asking for a day in court and ... if we get that, I have good feelings," said Ron Russell, lawyer for \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  Juan Andres, 41, who came to the United States as a teenager and whose son, a U.S. Marine, is heading to Afghanistan.\par \par \uc2 Russell said his client had until Thursday to file evidence with U.S. immigration officials to try to stop his deportation to Guatemala, according to The Courier-Journal of Louisville. Andres is being held in a jail in Boone County, Ky.\par \par \uc2 Russell said after the evidence is filed, Andres may get a chance to plead his case to a judge.\par \par \uc2 The evidence will include letters from Andres' five children, all of whom are U.S. citizens. One of them is Lance Cpl. Aspar Andres, who is scheduled to leave Sunday for his Marine camp, where he will await deployment to Afghanistan.\par \par \uc2 Juan Andres was arrested Dec. 9 when he accompanied a friend to an immigration office in Louisville to act as a translator.\par \par \uc2 An official in the office suspected Andres was not in the country legally, and Andres was arrested.\par \par \uc2 Russell said other letters supporting Andres have been written by friends and employers, as well as a county attorney and sheriff in one central Kentucky community where Andres has done agricultural work for years.\par \par \uc2 "He's got just a lot of people that think really highly of him," Russell said.\par \par \uc2 Russell said he had hoped immigration officials would give his client another week to prepare a petition signed by acquaintances, but he said he's glad they allowed him time to file anything.\par \par \uc2 He said it's fairly unusual for immigration officials to grant such a request. Russell said Andres could be granted a "green card" or permanent residency if immigration officials allow a hearing before a judge.\par \par \uc2 To get legal status, Andres would have to prove to the judge that he is of good moral character, has been in the country for 10 years and that deportation would create a hardship.\par \par \uc2 Russell said he believes Andres won't have any problem meeting the first two requirements. And he believes that Andres will clear the third hurdle because his children are citizens and he is the family's main breadwinner.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Information from: The Courier-Journal, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.courier-journal.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.courier-journal.com}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101230e6cu001qp\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) - A Marine's father sitting in a Kentucky jail awaiting deportation has one chance to prove he should be granted permanent residency in the United States, his lawyer said.\par \par \uc2 "We're just asking for a day in court and ... if we get that, I have good feelings," said Ron Russell, lawyer for \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  Juan Andres, 41, who came to the United States as a teenager and whose son, a U.S. Marine, is heading to Afghanistan.\par \par \uc2 Russell said his client had until Thursday to file evidence with U.S. immigration officials to try to stop his deportation to Guatemala, according to The Courier-Journal.\par \par \uc2 Russell said after the evidence is filed, Andres may get a chance to plead his case to a judge.\par \par \uc2 The evidence will include letters from Andres' five children, all of whom are U.S. citizens. One of them is Lance Cpl. Aspar Andres, who is scheduled to leave Sunday for his Marine camp, where he will await deployment to Afghanistan.\par \par \uc2 Juan Andres was arrested Dec. 9 when he accompanied a friend to an immigration office in Louisville to act as a translator.\par \par \uc2 An official in the office suspected Andres was not in the country legally, and Andres was arrested.\par \par \uc2 Russell said other letters supporting Andres have been written by friends and employers, as well as a county attorney and sheriff in one central Kentucky community where Andres has done agricultural work for years.\par \par \uc2 "He's got just a lot of people that think really highly of him," Russell said.\par \par \uc2 Russell said he had hoped immigration officials would give his client another week to prepare a petition signed by acquaintances, but he said he's glad they allowed him time to file anything.\par \par \uc2 He said it's fairly unusual for immigration officials to grant such a request. Russell said Andres could be granted a "green card" or permanent residency if immigration officials allow a hearing before a judge.\par \par \uc2 To get legal status, Andres would have to prove to the judge that he is of good moral character, has been in the country for 10 years and that deportation would create a hardship.\par \par \uc2 Russell said he believes Andres won't have any problem meeting the first two requirements. And he believes that Andres will clear the third hurdle because his children are citizens and he is the family's main breadwinner.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Information from: The Courier-Journal, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.courier-journal.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.courier-journal.com}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101230e6cu001l8\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc64}{\*\bkmkend toc64}\b \uc2 Deal's victory, Republican sweep of state government named top Ga. story of 2010\b0\par\par\uc2 By GREG BLUESTEIN   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 972 \uc2 words\par \uc2 27 December 2010\par 11:19\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2010.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ATLANTA (AP) - Georgia Democrats figured 2010 was their best chance in years to regain control of state government, with former Gov. Roy Barnes running at the top of the ticket against a Republican candidate plagued by ethical and financial questions.\par \par \uc2 The November election, though, dashed those Democratic dreams. Nathan Deal was the standard-bearer of a GOP sweep, as Republicans took every statewide office and beefed up their majorities in the Legislature. The vote, which proved the state's rightward tilt is neither flimsy nor fleeting, was the top Georgia story in 2010.\par \par \uc2 Other top stories include the state's struggle with illegal immigrants, the saga of a federal judge who was charged in a scandal involving drugs, guns and a stripper, and allegations of widespread cheating that led to an upheaval at Atlanta Public Schools.\par \par \uc2 It was a busy year in sports, too. Legendary Braves manager Bobby Cox retired after leading his injury-battered team to yet another playoff push, the dominant Falcons set their sights on a Super Bowl, and the Hawks canned coach Mike Woodson after falling in the second round of the playoffs for a second straight year.\par \par \uc2 Other top Georgia news and sports stories from 2010 included:\par \par \uc2 -- Rapper T.I. returned to jail for breaking his federal probation. He served about seven months in 2009 for a weapons violation and vowed a fresh start when he was released last year, but he was sentenced to another 11 months after he was arrested in Los Angeles on drug charges.\par \par \uc2 -- Four men claimed megachurch pastor Eddie Long coerced them into sexual relationships by abusing his spiritual authority to lure them into trysts with cars, jewelry and cash when they were 17 and 18. The embattled TV preacher denied the allegations, saying he was only a mentor to the men.\par \par \uc2 -- Georgia State University's football team played its first season, helping the school shed its commuter college reputation. Thousands of students, alumni and fans clad in the university's bright blue flocked to the Georgia Dome to watch coach Bill Curry's Panthers take the field.\par \par \uc2 -- University of Georgia athletic director Damon Evans, a married father of two, resigned after a state trooper pulled him over with a 28-year-old woman who was not his wife. The arrest report noted that a pair of her panties was found between Evans' legs and that Evans repeatedly referred to his position at Georgia.\par \par \uc2 -- Pittsburgh Steelers Quarterback Ben Roethlisberger was suspended four games after he was accused of sexually assaulting a college student in a Milledgeville bar. He wasn't charged by Georgia authorities after the local prosecutor determined there wasn't enough evidence to warrant criminal charges.\par \par \uc2 -- Georgia won $400 million in grant money from the U.S. Education Department's "Race to the Top" competition. The money will go to pilot a merit pay program for top educators, boost graduation rates, revamp the state's math and English standards and expand a system that tracks student progress.\par \par \uc2 In politics, Barnes tried to make a comeback after being ousted in a 2002 shocker by Sonny Perdue, then a little-known state senator who just a few years earlier had switched to the GOP. The Democrat carefully plotted his return in 2010, positioning himself as an outsider who would end teacher furloughs and lower Georgia's unemployment rate.\par \par \uc2 Given the anti-Democratic sentiment in Georgia, it could have been an easy contest for Deal, a longtime conservative congressman from north Georgia who pledged to stick to his conservative credentials. But Barnes eagerly went on the attack, calling Deal corrupt, raising questions about his finances and suggesting he used his office for personal gain.\par \par \uc2 It didn't work. Deal soundly defeated his Democratic rival, leading a Republican realignment that sent Democrats into disarray. Republicans took control of every office, seizing control of the Attorney General's office, as well as the state's top labor and agriculture post. U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson and other GOP incumbents coasted to re-election.\par \par \uc2 For Democrats, the hits kept coming. Nine Democratic state lawmakers switched parties, putting Republicans on the verge of reaching a supermajority in the House. Some were conservative members who often voted with the GOP majority, but the departure of others, like left-leaning state Rep. Doug McKillip of Athens, particularly stung party leaders.\par \par \uc2 The newly emboldened GOP majority will likely consider tough anti-illegal immigration measures. A committee of 14 Republican lawmakers formed to study the issue may even propose an Arizona-style crackdown that gives local law enforcement expanded powers.\par \par \uc2 The case of Jessica Colotl, a Georgia college student and \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  arrested on a minor traffic violation, was another reminder of the volatility of the issue. Colotl's arrest touched off a wider immigration debate, forcing state education officials to adopt stricter rules governing \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students.\par \par \uc2 Georgia's legal community was stunned in October when U.S. Senior Judge Jack Camp was arrested after authorities say a five-month probe revealed he was buying and using drugs with a stripper who was secretly cooperating with federal agents.\par \par \uc2 Camp stepped down in November after pleading guilty to a felony and two misdemeanors, but his arrest is still rippling through Georgia's courtrooms. Prosecutors say Camp made remarks during the investigation that suggested he had a racial bias, and defense attorneys quickly readied appeals.\par \par \uc2 And the Atlanta Public School system had another tumultuous year, as prosecutors announced an investigation into test tampering after state officials said they had clear-cut evidence that test results were improperly altered. Superintendent Beverly Hall said she will step down in June, and the board feuded in court and in public about who was in charge.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101227e6cr001mg\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SALT LAKE CITY (AP) - A Utah lawmaker wants to reverse a Utah law that grants in-state tuition to college students who are also illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 The Salt Lake Tribune says the bill sponsored by Rep. Carl Wimmer, R-Herriman, will be considered when the Utah Legislature convenes in January.\par \par \uc2 Utah law currently allows illegal immigrants who graduated from a Utah high school to pay in-state rates.\par \par \uc2 Wimmer's bill doesn't propose blocking access to education for students based on citizenship status. Wimmer said the tuition break is unfair to American-born citizens.\par \par \uc2 "Many of them will still go to college they'll just have to pay the full rate," Wimmer said. "It's fundamentally unfair that an American-born citizen from Evanston, Wyo., would have to pay more to go the University of Utah than an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . It's fundamentally flawed."\par \par \uc2 Should the bill pass, the rate change for immigrant students -- historically about 300 students annually -- would be significant.\par \par \uc2 Currently in-state tuition rates for a student taking 12 units at the University of Utah is $2,645 per semester. Out-of-state students pay $8,313.\par \par \uc2 Previous attempts to pass similar legislation have failed.\par \par \uc2 But Wimmer said he expects to be successful, mainly because Congress recently failed to pass an immigration bill, often referred to as the DREAM Act, that would have allowed students brought to the U.S. illegally use education or military service to earn residency and permanent status.\par \par \uc2 Utah-based DREAM Act activist Antonella Packard calls Wimmer's proposal a mistake. Under federal law, taxpayers are already mandated to educate \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students through high school, so there's little point to slamming the door on higher education for those who qualify, Packard said.\par \par \uc2 "It tells the children they have no future children who have grown up in the only country they've ever known," Packard said. "Whenever you go after children and this isn't a partisan position it's about common human decency."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Information from: The Salt Lake Tribune, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.sltrib.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.sltrib.com}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101226e6cq00244\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) - The number of illegal immigrants arrested for crimes in central Ohio whose cases are being transferred to federal authorities for likely deportation is soaring, a trend that police and prosecutors say can hurt cases and lead to new crimes.\par \par \uc2 The cases of 799 arrestees were transferred to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement from the Franklin County jail last year, up from 628 the year before and just 48 in 2008.\par \par \uc2 Because local and federal authorities aren't communicating about the transfers, illegal immigrants accused of crimes are using the deportation efforts to avoid prosecution for serious crimes, the Columbus Dispatch reported Sunday.\par \par \uc2 In recent months in Franklin County, ICE deported one man arrested after being caught with a pound of heroin, another man who was a witness to a homicide and a third man accused of molesting a 6-year-old child. Authorities said the homicide case fell apart after the witness was deported.\par \par \uc2 ICE said it's up to prosecutors to tell the jail when an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  should not be flagged for possible deportation. Franklin County Jail officials counter that it's federal immigration authorities who make that call.\par \par \uc2 The situation is a problem statewide, especially in urban areas where the high volume of cases makes communication between jailers, prosecutors and ICE officials even more difficult, said Bob Cornwell, executive director of the Buckeye State Sheriffs' Association.\par \par \uc2 The Columbus prosecutor's office has a backlog of unresolved cases involving drunken driving, driving without a license and domestic violence for defendants who were deported after their arrest.\par \par \uc2 "We say, 'Look, we know they're coming back. They have family members here,'" said Lara Baker, the chief city prosecutor. "We don't want them to have a free pass."\par \par \uc2 Some illegal immigrants accused of crimes welcome deportation over prosecution. Jose Noe Mejia said he wanted to be deported in 2006 rather than faces charges of raping a 7-year-old girl. He had already been transferred to ICE custody when a judge issued a warrant and he was returned to Franklin County Jail. Mejia pleaded guilty to three counts of attempted rape and one count of gross sexual imposition and is serving seven years in prison.\par \par \uc2 "Jail is worse," he said.\par \par \uc2 The miscommunication is undercutting the work police and prosecutors do, said Muzaffar Chishti, director of the Migration Policy Institute at the New York University School of Law.\par \par \uc2 "If the criminal justice system is made to make us safer and to penalize the people who committed crimes, what is this achieving?" Chishti said.\par \par \uc2 In addition, the possibility of being deported makes many in the immigrant community reluctant to step forward as a witness to a crime or as a crime victim, said Ruben Herrera, an immigrant-rights activist in Columbus.\par \par \uc2 "They feel like they're putting themselves at risk," he said.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Information from: The Columbus Dispatch, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.dispatch.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.dispatch.com}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101226e6cq00205\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) - A Kentucky Marine soon to be deployed in Afghanistan is asking for leniency for his father, who is facing deportation.\par \par \uc2 Lance Cpl. Aspar Andres spoke at a news conference on Monday, saying his father, Juan Andres, is a hardworking farmhand who is proud of his son's military service.\par \par \uc2 The Courier-Journal reports that the 41-year-old came here illegally from Guatemala as a teenager, more than 25 years ago. He was arrested recently after he accompanied a friend to a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement office to act as a translator and it became apparent to an official there that he was in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 Andres' attorney Becca O'Neill is asking Immigration and Customs Enforcement to defer deportation so Andres can present his case to officials. He is currently being held in the Boone County jail in northern Kentucky.\par \par \uc2 "He wasn't placed in custody because he committed a crime," O'Neill said. "He was just naively in the federal building."\par \par \uc2 O'Neill said Juan Andres is not entitled to a court review because of a previous case. He was deported in 1995 after being arrested in Georgia while driving other migrant farm workers in the country illegally, but eventually he came back.\par \par \uc2 But noting Aspar Andres' military status, O'Neill said "he deserves to have somebody listen to our request." She said she and Aspar Andres went to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement office on Monday but no one was able to speak with them.\par \par \uc2 Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokeswoman Gail Montenegro told The Courier-Journal that she could not comment on details of the case.\par \par \uc2 The 21-year-old Marine, who grew up mostly in Marion County and is one of five children ages 12 to 22, said Juan Andres has been a good father. "He taught me how to be a hard worker," he said.\par \par \uc2 Another person supporting the case was Jennifer Franklin. She said Juan Andres has worked for her father, Vallard Goode, for 14 years raising tobacco and beef at his Casey County farm.\par \par \uc2 "Juan Andres has worked very, very, very hard for what he's got, and we send his son off to fight for his country," said Franklin. "He's going to be (deported) to a country he knows nothing about. He has no home, he has nothing in Guatemala."\par \par \uc2 She said many Kentucky farms depend on migrant laborers.\par \par \uc2 "When they look at deporting large numbers of people like this, they don't understand you're going to go to \uc2 Kroger\uc2  and there's not going to be food," she said. "Because these are the people who are doing this labor."\par \par \uc2 O'Neill said immigration officials need to distinguish "when is it smart to enforce the law and when is it smart to be lenient."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Information from: The Courier-Journal, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.courier-journal.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.courier-journal.com}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101221e6cl001qb\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 LOS ANGELES (AP) - Emboldened by months of phone calls to lawmakers, hunger strikes and sit-ins, a group of college students and graduates in Los Angeles say they plan to take their fight for immigrant rights to the states and the 2012 election after Senate Republicans blocked a key piece of legislation.\par \par \uc2 But it won't be easy.\par \par \uc2 The Senate vote Saturday to toss the proposal that would have granted young illegal immigrants a route to legal status dealt a harsh blow to student activists who will face an even steeper uphill battle in the next Congress.\par \par \uc2 Immigrants see rough times ahead in the next two years, with many Republicans vowing to push for tougher immigration enforcement, but they also say Latino voters are getting fed up with lawmakers at a time when they are accruing greater political clout.\par \par \uc2 "This is a movement," said Nancy Meza, a 23-year-old \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  and college graduate who wore a University of California, Los Angeles sweatshirt as she watched the televised vote. "We don't have lobbyists and paid staff. It's a movement by students."\par \par \uc2 In the hours after the vote, Meza and about 50 other student activists who had gathered at the UCLA Downtown Labor Center said they would remind Latinos who stood by them -- and those who did not -- in the next election cycle. They will push for access to financial aid and drivers' licenses in states more friendly to immigrants like California.\par \par \uc2 Few said the legislation, many called the Dream Act, had a chance in the next two years with Republicans taking control of the House of Representatives and a shrinking Democratic majority in the Senate. But they said that wouldn't derail the networks they had set up across the country to support \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students and help them reveal their status and learn to live unafraid.\par \par \uc2 Some at the UCLA center, including university student Leslie Perez, 22, wept as they watched the vote on a big screen.\par \par \uc2 Minutes after it was over, many donned jackets and umbrellas to take to the rainy streets of Los Angeles, chanting "undocumented and unafraid."\par \par \uc2 Republicans might consider some kind of measure to help the students, but it would probably be much narrower, said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates stricter limits on immigration.\par \par \uc2 "This has a real demoralizing effect," Krikorian said of the student activists. "There's only so long you can keep up these hunger strikes and all this political theater they've been engaging in, especially if there's no specific target."\par \par \uc2 Another challenge is students could wind up feeling excluded when they can't work after graduation, despite their political activism.\par \par \uc2 "It may alienate the group we most want to incorporate," said Louis DeSipio, a professor of political science at University of California, Irvine.\par \par \uc2 Immigrant rights groups said they planned to turn up the pressure on the Obama administration to slow deportations, end local police enforcement of immigration laws and look out for the students, many of whom publicly revealed their immigration status over the last few months.\par \par \uc2 Students also said they planned to fight for immigrant benefits -- though it's not legalization -- locally as they've seen anti-illegal immigration activists do to pass tougher enforcement measures in states like Arizona.\par \par \uc2 "They're winning by state, they're winning by region," said Cyndi Bendezu, a 25-year-old University of California, Los Angeles graduate who was brought to the United States from Peru when she was 4 years old. "We have to win smaller victories."\par \par \uc2 Bendezu, who had been an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  when she started college, attained legal residency through a relative's petition. Now, she said she can't wait to become a citizen to be able to vote.\par \par \uc2 Students said Saturday that momentum they had gained in recent months was bigger than the legislative defeat.\par \par \uc2 The legislation would have provided a route to legal status for immigrants who were brought to the United States before age 16, have lived in the country for five years, graduated from high school or gained an equivalency degree and who joined the military or attend college.\par \par \uc2 It targeted the most sympathetic of the 10 million to 12 million illegal immigrants living in the United States -- those brought to the country as children, and who in many cases consider themselves American, speak English and have no ties to their native countries.\par \par \uc2 Critics of the bill called it a backdoor to amnesty that would encourage more foreigners to sneak into the United States in hopes of being legalized eventually.\par \par \uc2 The Mexican-born Meza said the vote makes it harder for her to finance graduate school to get a doctorate in education policy and become a professor.\par \par \uc2 But Meza, who came to the country when she was 2, said she'll find a way -- just as she did baby-sitting, tutoring and waiting tables to pay for college even though her degree now lies covered in dust in her living room, unused.\par \par \uc2 "It's not going to stop my educational goals," she said.\par \par \uc2 The legislation was proposed almost a decade ago. But it got its closest shot at getting passed this year after students stepped up their activism by making thousands of calls to lawmakers and leading marches and demonstrations. Several activists were arrested for refusing to leave Arizona Sen. John McCain's office.\par \par \uc2 The House of Representatives passed the measure earlier this month, but the Senate fell five votes short of the 60 needed to win its enactment.\par \par \uc2 Now, immigrant advocates who had touted the bill as a first push toward a broader legalization of immigrants will be working to deflect anticipated efforts by Republicans to ramp up restrictions on immigration.\par \par \uc2 "All of us are definitely preparing for much more defensive work," said Marielena Hincapie, executive director of the National Immigration Law Center.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101219e6cj002kx\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHOENIX (AP) - A Border Patrol agent killed on Tuesday was on a team pursuing a gang of bandits when he was killed, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano has confirmed.\par \par \uc2 Napolitano told The Arizona Republic's editorial board on Friday that 40-year-old Brian A. Terry's elite team was tracking the 'rip crew' when a gunbattle erupted in a remote southern Arizona canyon just north of the Mexican border.\par \par \uc2 Other agents arrested four suspects immediately after the shooting. A Border Patrol spokesman said Saturday that agents were still searching the rugged area for a fifth suspect.\par \par \uc2 "They were seeking to apprehend what's called a 'rip crew,' which is a name given to a crew that is organized to seek to rip off people who are drug mules or traversing the border illegally," she told the newspaper editorial board. "That's why they were in that area."\par \par \uc2 Napolitano's remarks were the first official confirmation of what occurred during the late-night confrontation. Officials with the Border Patrol union has previously described the encounter.\par \par \uc2 Napolitano, a former Arizona governor, state attorney general and U.S. attorney, declined to provide details about the suspects or elaborate on the circumstances of Terry's death, citing the ongoing investigation. She toured parts of the border Friday and met with some of Terry's colleagues as part of a previously planned trip to Arizona.\par \par \uc2 She said she reworked her schedule to meet with agents and praise the work they have done to increase security along the border, where the number of agents is at an all-time high.\par \par \uc2 "Here's the message that I gave to our Border Patrol agents down there, which is that the work they are doing is producing very, very strong results," she said. "And you can see that in every metric. ... There is no doubt that that border, which I know very well, having dealt with it since '93 when I became U.S. attorney here, is a very different place than it was five years ago, six years ago."\par \par \uc2 Arizona officials have criticized the federal government for failing to secure the border, with Gov. Jan Brewer and others saying crime and violence is spilling into Arizona.\par \par \uc2 But Napolitano cited FBI crime statistics showing that violent crime in Arizona, Texas, California and New Mexico has declined sharply in recent years. She said that agents have been, and still are, surging into the Border Patrol's Tucson Sector in Arizona and that the National Guard will continue to maintain a border presence.\par \par \uc2 "We're seizing more currency, we're seizing more drugs, we're seizing more guns, and so those numbers are going up," she said. "And the \uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2  apprehensions are down, which, again, is a measure that overall illegal immigration is down. So the numbers that need to be going up are going up, and the numbers that need to be going down are going down, and substantially so."\par \par \uc2 The number of \uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2  apprehensions in Arizona has plummeted from a high of 725,093 in fiscal 2000 to 219,318 in fiscal 2010, which ended on Sept. 30, Homeland Security statistics show.\par \par \uc2 Napolitano said she thinks the trend will continue.\par \par \uc2 "I believe that by the end of next year, we will have cut these numbers from 219,000 down to near 100,000," Napolitano said. "That would be my prediction. It may be a little more. It may be a little less. But something in that zone."\par \par \uc2 Increased numbers of Border Patrol agents and a poor economy are combining to cut the number of illegal immigrants crossing the border, she said.\par \par \uc2 Alan Bersin, commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, accompanied Napolitano and concurred with Napolitano's characterization of the border as safer and more secure than it has been in years. But he cautioned that the stepped-up enforcement efforts and aggressive steps taken "to dismantle these entrenched smuggling and organized-crime groups" increase the danger for Border Patrol agents.\par \par \uc2 "They know that they stand between the American people and the Arizona community and this kind of danger," Bersin said. "That shooting, in fact, in some ways is the result of a challenge that is being made by law enforcement here to organized crime."\par \par \uc2 Terry's death highlighted concerns about Mexico's drug war spilling across the border into the United States.\par \par \uc2 But Napolitano said it would be wrong to conclude from Terry's death or the shooting of a longtime southern Arizona rancher earlier this year as showing that drug violence is on the rise or rampant along the border.\par \par \uc2 "They were terrible crimes, and crimes occur, even when overall numbers are down," Napolitano said.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101218e6ci003rz\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 CINCINNATI (AP) - An 18-year-old Guatemalan native facing deportation said he is thankful to God and his supporters after his release Friday from a federal holding facility and hopes he will be able to remain in the United States.\par \par \uc2 Supporters of Bernard Pastor, of the Cincinnati area, had staged rallies, demonstrations and online campaigns in an effort to halt his deportation to a country he left at age 3. Pastor was detained last month by police after failing to produce a driver's license following an auto accident and was taken into custody by federal immigration officials.\par \par \uc2 Pastor told The Associated Press in a telephone interview after his release that he had trouble believing it when he was told he was going to be freed.\par \par \uc2 "I was speechless at first," he said. "But I never gave up on my faith, and I have always known that God was in control," he said.\par \par \uc2 Khaalid Walls, a spokesman for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, declined to comment Friday other than to confirm the release and that the case was put on hold.\par \par \uc2 The past few weeks in the holding facility were not too bad, Pastor said.\par \par \uc2 "The only difficult day was my dad's birthday when I had to call him to say happy birthday," he said.\par \par \uc2 Pastor, a top student and soccer player at his former high school, saw his life change drastically after police discovered he was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . He was jailed, and his removal from this country ordered because his father's claim to political asylum -- saying he faced persecution in Guatemala -- was denied by a federal judge several years ago\par \par \uc2 Pastor, who considers himself an American, speaks little Spanish and hardly knows anyone in Guatemala. His family's whereabouts haven't been made public since his arrest.\par \par \uc2 Immigration officials held off on deporting Pastor after two Ohio Democrats in Congress, Sen. Sherrod Brown and Rep. Steve Driehaus, intervened. But officials said he was in this country illegally and was a citizen of Guatemala.\par \par \uc2 Pastor's attorney, David Leopold, said that the fight to prevent his client's deportation is not over.\par \par \uc2 "Officials did what was right today, but we need to fix the broken immigration system," said Leopold, who heads the American Immigration Lawyers Association.\par \par \uc2 Leopold was headed to Washington for a scheduled Senate vote on the proposed DREAM Act. The legislation would provide a path to legal status for some illegal immigrants who were brought to the United States before the age of 16 and join the military or attend college.\par \par \uc2 Backers have called Pastor a poster child for the proposed legislation. Opponents say passing the legislation would encourage more illegal immigration at a time when many Americans are looking for jobs.\par \par \uc2 Leo Pierson, the Ohio state director of civil rights for the League of United Latin American Citizens, picked up Pastor upon his release and was flying with him to Washington to lend support to the bill.\par \par \uc2 "I have always believed that reform will come," said Pastor, who also planned to see his family as soon as possible.\par \par \uc2 Pierson said he called Pastor's father, a Pentecostal minister, to tell him of his son's release.\par \par \uc2 "His father just gasped and said 'Thank God' in Spanish," Pierson said. "You could just hear the release of all the tension that had built up come out in that gasp."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writer Dan Sewell in Cincinnati contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101218e6ci0000m\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 OMAHA, Neb. (AP) - A Nebraska judge threw out a lawsuit on Friday challenging a state law that allows some illegal immigrants to pay in-state college tuition.\par \par \uc2 The lawsuit filed in January on behalf of six Nebraska residents claimed that their taxes were being used to support the state's immigration-tuition law in violation of federal law. The lawsuit named the University of Nebraska Board of Regents and other state college boards as defendants and asked the judge to prevent schools officials from following the law.\par \par \uc2 Jefferson County District Judge Paul Korslund said in his ruling that the Nebraska residents who filed the suit should have first gone to the federal government to ask it to challenge the law before such a case could be heard in the state courts.\par \par \uc2 The residents' attorney Kris Kobach called the dismissal "a bump in the road." He said he hasn't yet decided how to proceed, but the case is far from over.\par \par \uc2 The state law says students whose parents brought them to the U.S. illegally may pay in-state tuition fees, as long as they graduated from Nebraska high schools, lived in the state for at least three years and are pursuing or promise to pursue legal status.\par \par \uc2 In-state tuition can be significantly cheaper than fees for out-of-state residents. For example, undergraduate tuition at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln is about $6,000 per year for in-state students and $17,650 for those from out of state.\par \par \uc2 The Nebraska law was passed in 2005 over Gov. Dave Heineman's veto.\par \par \uc2 5\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101217e6ch00217\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

Brown won't support DREAM Act, calls it 'backdoor amnesty' for illegal immigrants\b0\par\par\uc2 By RUSSELL CONTRERAS   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 455 \uc2 words\par \uc2 13 December 2010\par 16:23\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2010.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 BOSTON (AP) - Sen. Scott Brown said Monday he will not support the DREAM Act and called the bill aimed at helping \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  college students "backdoor amnesty."\par \par \uc2 Speaking to reporters at a Salvation Army charity event in downtown Boston, the Massachusetts Republican said he would not vote for the proposal despite months of intense pressure from advocates and educators that included Harvard University President Drew Gilpin Faust.\par \par \uc2 "I'm not supportive of it," he said. "I think it's a backdoor amnesty and I'm not in favor of it."\par \par \uc2 Under the proposal, some illegal immigrants would qualify for permanent legal residency by graduating from college or trade school, or by joining the military. The Senate is slated to vote on the measure this week, but supporters aren't sure if they have enough votes to break a filibuster.\par \par \uc2 Brown's remarks came as a coalition of educators, religious leaders and immigrant advocates made a last ditch appeal Monday asking him to support the proposal. Brown also had been a target of a national campaign by advocates.\par \par \uc2 For months, supporters of the bill and \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  college students, who call themselves "DREAMers," have staged sit-ins, rallies and marches outside Brown's office. Students have left hundreds of signed letters from supporters and young immigrants who said they would enlisted in the military if the bill passed.\par \par \uc2 In September, Brown came out against the DREAM Act being attached to a defense bill and said supporters were "playing politics with military funding in order to extend a form of amnesty to certain illegal immigrants."\par \par \uc2 But advocates had remained hopeful that Brown might support a standalone bill after hearing stories from students who live in Massachusetts. Many of the students who would benefit from the bill were brought to the U.S. as young children.\par \par \uc2 "It's unfortunate that Sen. Brown has decided to stand against the majority of the American public on this issue," said Kyle de Beausset, a U.S. citizen and a member of the Boston-based Student Immigrant Movement. "Amnesty implies forgiveness. How can you give forgiveness to innocent, young people who did nothing wrong?"\par \par \uc2 Renata Teodoro, 23, a Boston student who would benefit from the DREAM Act, said Brown's decision would not prevent her from pushing for the bill.\par \par \uc2 "It's not going to stop me or us from trying to persuade him and other senators about the DREAM Act," said Teodoro, who has organized protest outside Brown's Boston office. "I'm disappointed, but I'm not discouraged."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writer Steve LeBlanc in Boston contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101213e6cd002hu\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 MIAMI (AP) - The illegal immigrants who more than a decade ago were just teens hoping to forge a legal path to citizenship are vowing to make the Dream Act a campaign issue come 2012, even though they'll likely be too old to benefit if the law ever passes.\par \par \uc2 The measure that passed in the House on Wednesday is unlikely go anywhere in the Senate, and the House is unlikely to revisit the issue once the new Republican leadership takes over.\par \par \uc2 Groups like The National Council of La Raza and other Hispanic and immigrant advocacy groups know the prospects for comprehensive immigration reform are dim for the time being. So they've turned their attention to a measure that they believe will spark more sympathy from most Americans, bringing with them a coalition of labor groups, the Conference of Catholic Bishops and even Defense Secretary Robert Gates. And come 2012, advocates say, Spanish-language media will be filled with ads slamming lawmakers who voted against the Dream Act.\par \par \uc2 "Many of us come from families with mixed (immigration) status. We can't vote, but our families and friends can," said Julieta Garibay, 29, one of the original "Dreamers" who has pushed for the Dream Act since it was first introduced in Congress in 2001. "Our allies will remember who voted, and how they voted, and will hold them accountable in 2012."\par \par \uc2 The Dream Act would provide qualified people up to the age of 29 with a path to citizenship if they attend college or join the military, while mandating decades before they could petition for family. An estimated 2.1 million immigrants could be eligible, though it's likely a far smaller number would meet the bill's requirements.\par \par \uc2 "The Dream Act is extremely powerful for that reason because it impacts kids who came at a young age, who truly did whatever was asked of them, stayed out of trouble and just want to get educated or join the military," said America's Voice Deputy Director Lynn Tramonte.\par \par \uc2 Opponents have said it will hurt Americans at a time when the nation already faces 9.8 percent unemployment. Some also decried the age cap of 29.\par \par \uc2 "Those are pretty old kids," U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, said during the House debate. Smith called the legislation "a nightmare," predicting the U.S. government would be unable to conduct background checks on all those applying.\par \par \uc2 Garibay, who came to Austin, Texas from Mexico City with her mother when she was 12, now has a master's in nursing but is unable to work in her chosen field because of her status. Yet she said she won't fade into the shadows after the vote. That, she said, is the biggest change from a decade ago.\par \par \uc2 "The first articles in the Spanish media that came out about us, there was a picture in the newspaper. We had these fearful faces," she recalled. "Now, our young students are coming out, saying 'we're undocumented, and unafraid.'"\par \par \uc2 More and more immigrants are taking up the phrase of the gay rights movement and "coming out" about their status, driven by desperation and the Obama administration's shift toward deporting criminals.\par \par \uc2 In January, a group of Miami Dream Act students walked from South Florida to Washington, telling their stories to those they met along the way. Students at Ivy League universities such as Brown and Columbia have also spoken up about their illegal status.\par \par \uc2 And last month, Fresno State University student body president Pedro Ramirez, 22, went public about his status after he was outed by the school paper. Ramirez said he has since received support from as far as away as Tennessee and Maine. The same day Ramirez went public, Jose Salcedo, 19, a student body president at Miami-Dade College, announced he was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Matias Ramos, 24, was brought to Garden Grove, Calif., with his Argentinean parents on tourist visas when he was 14. They never left.\par \par \uc2 Ramos, a graduate of the University of California, Los Angeles, now works for United We Dream, the Washington-based advocacy group Garibay helped found under the auspices of the National Immigration Law Center. Over the past decade, the group has morphed from a few activists to a national network with affiliates in 25 states.\par \par \uc2 He said he appreciates the backing of the broader immigrant coalition but stressed that students have been pushing the bill for years. "It's simple. This is our lives," he said.\par \par \uc2 On Thursday, as students fanned out across the Senate to press their case, Ramos organized a Los Angeles phone bank. It and many others across the nation collectively logged 77,000 phone calls to Congress that day. The activists say they could bring the same organization and energy to the next election.\par \par \uc2 Jong-Min, 30, who asked that his surname not be used because he feared his family could be deported, said the Internet and social networking sites have been a lifeline, helping him find others with similar stories and enabling him to share his own.\par \par \uc2 "I started to realize it wasn't just about me and my case. I had a social responsibility as well. There were kids who were so depressed (about their future) they were thinking of suicide," he said.\par \par \uc2 Jong-Min, who came with his family to the U.S. from South Korea when he was a baby, has a college degree but has been unable to find work.\par \par \uc2 Jong-Min said he has accepted his duty is now to work on behalf of those who are still eligible but said it was painful to hear Rep. Smith's complaints about the age cap.\par \par \uc2 "We were the original Dreamers when the bill was first introduced in 2001," he said. "They talk about us as being old. What did people expect, that we would stop aging?"\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101211e6cb002st\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ATLANTA (AP) - Seven congressmen have asked the head of the federal immigration agency to explain why states with fewer illegal immigrants are getting a new enforcement program ahead of Georgia.\par \par \uc2 In a letter dated Thursday, all seven of Georgia's Republican congressmen invited U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement director John Morton to meet with them on Capitol Hill.\par \par \uc2 At issue is a federal program called Secure Communities, which allows fingerprint information to be checked against FBI criminal history records and biometrics-based immigration records kept by the Department of Homeland Security.\par \par \uc2 Supporters of the program say it simplifies information-sharing between local and federal law enforcement agencies and is aimed at identifying only illegal immigrants accused of breaking the law. But civil liberties and immigrant rights groups say it could encourage racial profiling or make illegal immigrants afraid to report crimes for fear of being deported.\par \par \uc2 ICE spokeswoman Barbara Gonzalez confirmed receipt of the letter Friday and said ICE will respond "through the appropriate channels." She said "a substantial number" of Georgia counties this year will receive the enforcement program, which is to go nationwide by 2013.\par \par \uc2 The program is currently being used by law enforcement agencies in nine of Georgia's 159 counties and is expected to be active in the entire state by the end of the 2013 fiscal year.\par \par \uc2 All seven of the Republicans signed the letter but none of the state's six Democratic congressmen did.\par \par \uc2 The seven initially wrote to Morton on Oct. 13 asking that ICE implement Secure Communities throughout Georgia "as soon as possible" and noting that priority in the deployment process was being given to high-risk jurisdictions.\par \par \uc2 Elliot Williams, ICE's assistant director for congressional relations, said in a letter Nov. 17 that in addition to considering risk, the agency must also consider whether field offices in each state have the capacity to respond to identification inquiries 24 hours a day.\par \par \uc2 In the letter Thursday, the congressmen requested that the rollout of Secure Communities be "pursued sooner and more efficiently than it has currently been."\par \par \uc2 They point out that the Pew Hispanic Center estimates Georgia's \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  population at 425,000. That ranks Georgia at No. 7 in terms of states with the highest estimated number of illegal immigrants, according to Pew.\par \par \uc2 "Our question to you now is simple," the Georgia lawmakers wrote. "Why would you utilize such valuable and seemingly scarce resources to fully activate Secure Communities in such states as Hawaii and West Virginia, whose total \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  populations are estimated at 35,000 and 10,000, respectively, before Georgia?"\par \par \uc2 "It seems as if ICE is not responsibly combating the ever-mounting problem of illegal immigration in this nation in order to best utilize the resources it has been granted by Congress," they wrote.\par \par \uc2 The seven congressmen who signed the letter are: Jack Kingston of Savannah, Lynn Westmoreland of Grantville, Tom Price of Roswell, John Linder of Duluth, Tom Graves of Ranger, Paul Broun of Athens and Phil Gingrey of Marietta.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101210e6ca002a0\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) - The Senate moved Thursday to delay a politically charged showdown vote on legislation carving out a path to legal status for foreign-born youngsters brought to this country illegally, putting off but probably not preventing the measure's demise.\par \par \uc2 Facing GOP objections, Democrats put aside the so-called Dream Act and said they'd try again to advance it before year's end. They're short of the 60 votes needed to do so, however, and critics in both parties quickly said they won't change their minds in the waning days of the Democratic-controlled Congress.\par \par \uc2 "This is mainly a political exercise rather than a serious attempt to deal with our broken immigration system," said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas.\par \par \uc2 Sen. Ben Nelson of Nebraska, one of several Democrats who have broken with their leaders to oppose the bill, said he too would block efforts to consider it.\par \par \uc2 The bill grants hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children a chance to gain legal status if they enroll in college or join the military.\par \par \uc2 The House passed it Wednesday night after Democratic leaders painstakingly lined up the votes to push it through. Just eight Republicans joined Democrats to support it while almost 40 Democrats defected to vote "no."\par \par \uc2 In the Senate, Democrats had virtually no chance of attracting any GOP support to move the legislation since all 42 Republicans have signed a letter pledging to block action on any issue until bills to extend expiring tax cuts and fund the government were completed.\par \par \uc2 The White House said the Senate's postponement was "the right way to move forward" to get bipartisan support for the bill. In a statement, press secretary Robert Gibbs called the measure "the right thing to do for our nation, our economy and our security."\par \par \uc2 There's no indication, though, that Democrats will be able to gather the 60 votes needed for quick action on an issue as emotional and complicated as immigration.\par \par \uc2 "We have to demonstrate that we are serious about fixing our broken immigration system, we have to secure the border, we have to enforce our laws, and then I think the natural compassion of the American people will kick in, and they'll let us deal with these sympathetic situations like these kids who are not culpable, but were brought here by their parents and find themselves at a dead end," Cornyn said.\par \par \uc2 The measure is viewed by Hispanic activists and immigrant advocates as a down payment on what they had hoped would be broader action by President Barack Obama and Congress to give the nation's 10 million to 12 million undocumented immigrants a chance to gain legal status.\par \par \uc2 It targets the most sympathetic of the millions of undocumented people -- those brought to the United States as children, who in many cases consider themselves American, speak English and have no ties to or family living in their native countries.\par \par \uc2 "We owe it to the young men and women whose lives will be affected, we owe it to America who needs their service in the military and needs their skill in building our economy to honestly address this issue and ask members of both sides to sit down, pause and reflect as to whether or not we can afford to say to these talented young men and women, `There is no place in America for you,' " said Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill. "There is a place."\par \par \uc2 Critics denounce the bill as a backdoor amnesty grant that would encourage more foreigners to sneak into the United States in hopes of eventually being legalized as well.\par \par \uc2 "The American people ... tried to tell this Congress, but the Congress and the political leadership refuses to listen. What they're saying is, `Do not continue to reward illegality. Do not continue to provide benefits for people who violated our law, please,' " said Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala.\par \par \uc2 With the GOP taking control of the House and representing a stronger minority in the Senate next year, failure to enact the legislation by year's end would dim the prospects for action by Congress to grant a path toward legalization for the nation's millions of undocumented immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Obama's drive to enact the legislation and congressional Democrats' determination to vote on it before year's end reflect the party's efforts to satisfy Hispanic groups whose backing has been critical in elections and will be again in 2012.\par \par \uc2 The legislation would apply to illegal immigrants brought to the United States before the age of 16, who have been here for five years and graduated from high school or gained an equivalency degree, and who join the military or attend college.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101210e6ca000gy\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Student protesters rampage, attack Prince Charles' car as UK lawmakers OK tuition fee hike\par \par \uc2 LONDON (AP) -- In Britain's worst political violence in years, furious student protesters rained sticks and rocks on riot police, vandalized government buildings and attacked a car carrying Prince Charles and his wife, Camilla, after lawmakers approved a controversial hike in university tuition fees.\par \par \uc2 Demonstrators set upon the heir to the throne's limousine as it drove through London's West End shopping and entertainment hub. Protesters who had been running amok and smashing shop windows kicked and threw paint at the car, which sped off.\par \par \uc2 Charles' office, Clarence House, confirmed the attack but said "their royal highnesses are unharmed."\par \par \uc2 Police said it was unclear whether the royals had been deliberately targeted, or were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time.\par \par \uc2 The couple arrived looking composed at the London Palladium theater, where they were attending a Royal Variety Performance. Their Rolls Royce limousine was left with a badly cracked rear window and was spattered with paint.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Senate blocks bill to overturn 'don't ask, don't tell,' making repeal unlikely anytime soon\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans blocked a last-ditch effort in the Senate to lift the military's ban on openly gay troops on Thursday, dealing a major blow to gay rights groups and making it unlikely Congress could repeal "don't ask, don't tell" any time soon.\par \par \uc2 The 57-40 vote fell three short of the 60 needed to overcome procedural hurdles to lift the 17-year-old ban. Sen. Susan Collins of Maine was the lone Republican voting to advance the bill, and Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia was the only Democrat to vote against it.\par \par \uc2 The rejection was a defeat for President Barack Obama, who campaigned promising to overturn the law and later called it one of his top legislative priorities for the year. But in the end, the White House did little to push the legislation, focusing its influence instead on tax cuts and a nuclear arms treaty with Russia.\par \par \uc2 Repeal advocates said the fight wasn't over, but Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid seemed to have little appetite to return to the subject with only a week left in the lame-duck session and other major legislation pending.\par \par \uc2 "The other side may feel passionately that our military should sanction discrimination based on sexual orientation, but they are clearly in the minority," Reid, D-Nev., said of Republicans. "And they have run out of excuses."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 White House predicts passage of big tax-cut compromise despite rebellion by House Democrats\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) -- Angry House Democrats staged a noisy revolt Thursday against President Barack Obama's year-end tax cut agreement with Republicans, pledging to block a vote unless there are changes to scale back billions ticketed to help the rich. The White House still predicted quick passage.\par \par \uc2 "If it's take it or leave it, we'll leave it," said Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas, after a closed-door meeting in which rank-and-file Democrats chanted, "Just say no."\par \par \uc2 Despite the flare-up, the White House expressed confidence the measure would be approved before Congress goes home for the year, and Senate Democratic officials said talks were under way to add tax breaks for the alternative energy industry as a way of building support in the party.\par \par \uc2 "The deal will get passed," said presidential press secretary Robert Gibbs. There were no predictions to the contrary among senior Democrats on either side of the Capitol.\par \par \uc2 As announced by Obama on Monday, the deal would extend tax breaks at all income levels that are due to expire on Jan. 1, renew a program of jobless benefits for the long-term unemployed that is due to lapse within days and implement a one-year cut in Social Security taxes.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Democrats, short of votes, delay action on legalization for \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  youngsters\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate moved Thursday to delay a politically charged showdown vote on legislation carving out a path to legal status for foreign-born youngsters brought to this country illegally, putting off but probably not preventing the measure's demise.\par \par \uc2 Facing GOP objections, Democrats put aside the so-called Dream Act and said they'd try again to advance it before year's end. They're short of the 60 votes needed to do so, however, and critics in both parties quickly said they won't change their minds in the waning days of the Democratic-controlled Congress.\par \par \uc2 "This is mainly a political exercise rather than a serious attempt to deal with our broken immigration system," said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas.\par \par \uc2 Sen. Ben Nelson of Nebraska, one of several Democrats who have broken with their leaders to oppose the bill, said he too would block efforts to consider it.\par \par \uc2 The bill grants hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children a chance to gain legal status if they enroll in college or join the military.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Authorities burn down S. Calif. home so packed with explosives it was too dangerous to enter\par \par \uc2 ESCONDIDO, Calif. (AP) -- A fire intentionally set Thursday to destroy an explosives-filled house in a suburban San Diego neighborhood rapidly consumed the structure without major problems as fire crews and curious onlookers watched.\par \par \uc2 Authorities said the home was so packed with homemade explosives that they had no choice but to burn it to the ground.\par \par \uc2 Remotely controlled explosive devices ignited the home in Escondido and it quickly became engulfed in flames as thick smoke rose high into the sky, going just as authorities had planned to avoid spreading toxic fumes through the community.\par \par \uc2 The fire began with puffs of smoke that rapidly grew larger and shot through the roof before spectacular orange flames overtook the house. Popping noises heard during the fire were likely hand grenades and ammunition, officials said.\par \par \uc2 At the height of the fire, Shirley Abernethy, 82, stood on a neighbor's porch about a block away from the fire. Scores of others living closer to the home were evacuated the previous night.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Crackdown on WikiLeaks sparks protests, cyber-skirmishes and legal threats across the world\par \par \uc2 LONDON (AP) -- Skirmishes raged across cyberspace Thursday between WikiLeaks supporters and the companies they accuse of trying to stifle the group, with websites on both sides of the battle line taken out of service or choked off by attacks.\par \par \uc2 The U.N.'s top human rights official raised the alarm over officials' and corporations' moves to cut off WikiLeaks' funding and starve it of server space -- something she described as a "potentially violating WikiLeaks' right to freedom of expression."\par \par \uc2 Navi Pillay also expressed surprise at the scale of the online attacks that have targeted major American financial players -- in some cases denying access to their websites for hours at a time.\par \par \uc2 "It's truly what media would call a cyber-war. It's just astonishing what is happening," Pillay told reporters in Geneva.\par \par \uc2 WikiLeaks has been under intense pressure since it began publishing some 250,000 secret U.S. diplomatic cables, with attacks on its websites and threats against its founder, Julian Assange, who is now in a British jail fighting extradition to Sweden on sex crime allegations.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Closing arguments begin in federal trial of street preacher charged with 2002 Smart abduction\par \par \uc2 SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The trial of a street preacher charged with kidnapping Elizabeth Smart has entered its final stage, with federal prosecutors making their closing arguments Thursday before a jury gets the case.\par \par \uc2 The trial has lasted five weeks, and its not known how long jurors might take to decide whether Brian David Mitchell is guilty of kidnapping and raping Smart in 2002, when she was 14. If he is convicted, the 57-year-old street preacher could spend the rest of his life in prison.\par \par \uc2 Mitchell's attorneys don't dispute the facts of the crime but contend Mitchell is mentally ill and can't be held responsible. Jurors could also find him not guilty by reason of insanity, or they could find him not guilty.\par \par \uc2 During the trial, Mitchell was removed daily from the courtroom for singing hymns and disrupting proceedings. Last week, he had a seizure in the holding room where he watches the trial on television. He spent several hours at a hospital before being returned to a jail.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors contend Mitchell is faking mental illness to avoid prosecution.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 SAfrican kayaker presumed dead after crocodile attack on Congo river; 2 Americans survive\par \par \uc2 JOHANNESBURG (AP) -- An acclaimed outdoorsman who wrote movingly about testing himself against nature is presumed dead after a crocodile snatched him from his kayak while he led an American expedition from the source of the White Nile into the heart of Congo.\par \par \uc2 Two Americans being guided by 35-year-old South African Hendrik Coetzee on the grueling trip could only watch in horror. They paddled unharmed to safety after the Tuesday morning attack on the Lukuga River in Congo.\par \par \uc2 The International Rescue Committee, which runs development projects in the Central African nation, helped evacuate the Americans to a nearby town, Ciaran Donnelly, the organization's regional director in Congo, said Thursday.\par \par \uc2 Coetzee's body has not been recovered. The stretch of river where the trio was traveling is notoriously dangerous because of its whitewater, and the high density of crocodiles and hippos.\par \par \uc2 In a blog called The Great White Explorer that chronicled the trip sponsored by the Eddie Bauer clothing and outdoor equipment company, Coetzee wrote about the thrill of taking to uncharted waters, including stretches that might soon disappear due to planned dams. He also described sometimes facing suspicion from military and other officials. One day ended in a storm:\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Pardon me 2 times: Morrison forgiven for Fla. convictions prompted by wild 1969 Doors concert\par \par \uc2 TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- This is the end for 40-year-old convictions that left Jim Morrison marked with what today would be considered sex-offender status. Florida's Clemency Board, egged on by departing Gov. Charlie Crist, pardoned The Doors' long-dead singer Thursday on indecent exposure and profanity charges stemming from a wild concert.\par \par \uc2 Some people who were at the Miami show March 1, 1969, insist even today that he exposed himself, though others in the audience and Morrison's bandmates contend he was just teasing the crowd and only pretended to do the deed. Crist, tuned in to the controversy by a Doors fan, said there was enough doubt about what happened at the Dinner Key Auditorium to justify a pardon.\par \par \uc2 The board, which consists of Crist and a three-member Cabinet, voted unanimously to pardon Morrison as they granted several other pardons Thursday. At the hearing, the governor called the convictions a "blot" on the record of an accomplished artist for "something he may or may not have done."\par \par \uc2 He said Morrison died before he was afforded the chance to present his appeal, so Crist was doing that for him. Board members pointed out several times that they couldn't retry the case but that the pardon forgave Morrison and negated his sentence.\par \par \uc2 "In this case the guilt or innocence is in God's hands, not ours," Crist said.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Actor Wesley Snipes begins serving 3-year sentence at federal prison in Pennsylvania\par \par \uc2 LEWIS RUN, Pa. (AP) -- Actor Wesley Snipes began serving a three-year sentence at a federal prison in Pennsylvania on Thursday for failure to file income tax returns. Snipes, 48, arrived shortly before noon at the Federal Correctional Institution McKean in the tiny northwestern Pennsylvania town of Lewis Run, federal prisons spokesman Ed Ross said. He had been ordered to surrender by noon.\par \par \uc2 The minimum security prison camp is worlds away from the harsh prison fortresses depicted in the Snipes' films "Undisputed" and "Brooklyn's Finest." The minimum-security camp doesn't have fences around its perimeter.\par \par \uc2 The 300 nonviolent inmates live in barracks that feature two-man rooms, daily showers and double-feature movie showings Friday through Sunday. Alas, no NC-17, R or X ratings allowed, which knocks out much of Snipes' action-heavy repertoire.\par \par \uc2 The most jarring aspect of the celebrity's stay might be the five daily head counts, three during the overnight hours. And Snipes, who earned a reported $13 million for the "Blade: Trinity" sequel, will have to adjust to earning just pennies an hour handling kitchen, laundry or other campus chores. He can spend just $290 a month at the prison commissary.\par \par \uc2 Snipes has appeared in dozens of studio films, from "White Men Can't Jump" and "Demolition Man" in the early 1990s to the blockbuster Blade trilogy.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101209e6c900392\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) - The Senate moved Thursday to delay a politically charged showdown vote on legislation carving out a path to legal status for foreign-born youngsters brought to this country illegally, putting off but probably not preventing the measure's demise.\par \par \uc2 Facing GOP objections, Democrats put aside the so-called Dream Act and said they'd try again to advance it before year's end. They're short of the 60 votes needed to do so, however, and critics in both parties quickly said they won't change their minds in the waning days of the Democratic-controlled Congress.\par \par \uc2 "This is mainly a political exercise rather than a serious attempt to deal with our broken immigration system," said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas.\par \par \uc2 Sen. Ben Nelson of Nebraska, one of several Democrats who have broken with their leaders to oppose the bill, said he too would block efforts to consider it.\par \par \uc2 The bill grants hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children a chance to gain legal status if they enroll in college or join the military.\par \par \uc2 The House passed it Wednesday night after Democratic leaders painstakingly lined up the votes to push it through. Just eight Republicans joined Democrats to support it while almost 40 Democrats defected to vote "no."\par \par \uc2 In the Senate, Democrats had virtually no chance of attracting any GOP support to move the legislation since all 42 Republicans have signed a letter pledging to block action on any issue until bills to extend expiring tax cuts and fund the government were completed.\par \par \uc2 The White House said the Senate's postponement was "the right way to move forward" to get bipartisan support for the bill. In a statement, press secretary Robert Gibbs called the measure "the right thing to do for our nation, our economy and our security."\par \par \uc2 There's no indication, though, that Democrats will be able to gather the 60 votes needed for quick action on an issue as emotional and complicated as immigration.\par \par \uc2 "We have to demonstrate that we are serious about fixing our broken immigration system, we have to secure the border, we have to enforce our laws, and then I think the natural compassion of the American people will kick in, and they'll let us deal with these sympathetic situations like these kids who are not culpable, but were brought here by their parents and find themselves at a dead end," Cornyn said.\par \par \uc2 The measure is viewed by Hispanic activists and immigrant advocates as a down payment on what they had hoped would be broader action by President Barack Obama and Congress to give the nation's 10 million to 12 million undocumented immigrants a chance to gain legal status.\par \par \uc2 It targets the most sympathetic of the millions of undocumented people -- those brought to the United States as children, who in many cases consider themselves American, speak English and have no ties to or family living in their native countries.\par \par \uc2 "We owe it to the young men and women whose lives will be affected, we owe it to America who needs their service in the military and needs their skill in building our economy to honestly address this issue and ask members of both sides to sit down, pause and reflect as to whether or not we can afford to say to these talented young men and women, 'There is no place in America for you,' " said Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill. "There is a place."\par \par \uc2 Critics denounce the bill as a backdoor amnesty grant that would encourage more foreigners to sneak into the United States in hopes of eventually being legalized as well.\par \par \uc2 "The American people ... tried to tell this Congress, but the Congress and the political leadership refuses to listen. What they're saying is, 'Do not continue to reward illegality. Do not continue to provide benefits for people who violated our law, please,' " said Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala.\par \par \uc2 With the GOP taking control of the House and representing a stronger minority in the Senate next year, failure to enact the legislation by year's end would dim the prospects for action by Congress to grant a path toward legalization for the nation's millions of undocumented immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Obama's drive to enact the legislation and congressional Democrats' determination to vote on it before year's end reflect the party's efforts to satisfy Hispanic groups whose backing has been critical in elections and will be again in 2012.\par \par \uc2 The legislation would apply to illegal immigrants brought to the United States before the age of 16, who have been here for five years and graduated from high school or gained an equivalency degree, and who join the military or attend college.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101209e6c90008r\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

WEBER   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 658 \uc2 words\par \uc2 8 December 2010\par 17:50\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2010.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SAN ANTONIO (AP) - Family members of an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  found dead in a federal prison filed a lawsuit Wednesday against the Texas facility, where inmates took hostages and set fires during a riot after the man's body was carried out.\par \par \uc2 The 96-page federal lawsuit revives attention on the Reeves County Detention Center in Pecos, about 175 miles east of El Paso. The prison came under scrutiny in 2008, following the death of Jesus Manuel Galindo and two riots just six weeks apart that caused an estimated $1 million in damage.\par \par \uc2 Galindo died in December 2008 after the 32-year-old had an epileptic seizure while placed in solitary confinement, his family's attorneys said. The lawsuit accuses the facility of being indifferent to prisoners' medical needs and using solitary confinement to punish inmates who complained of being sick.\par \par \uc2 The defendants named in the lawsuit include Reeves County and the \uc2 Geo Group Inc\uc2 ., which runs the prison. Geo Group is the nation's second-largest private prison contractor and operates 14 prisons in Texas.\par \par \uc2 "They bear legal and moral responsibility for this preventable death," said Lisa Graybill, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union, which is helping the family with the suit.\par \par \uc2 Pablo Paez, a spokesman for the Geo Group, said the company couldn't comment on pending litigation. Phone calls to the county attorney's office in Reeves County went unanswered.\par \par \uc2 The lawsuit also names several employees of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, which said Wednesday that it does not comment on litigation.\par \par \uc2 The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in El Paso, seeks unspecified damages.\par \par \uc2 Galindo, who was from Ciduad Juarez, Mexico, was serving a 30-month sentence for illegal re-entry when he died. A longtime epileptic, he constantly told prison staff about his condition, according to the lawsuit.\par \par \uc2 A riot broke out after Galindo's death, as his body was being carried out of the prison. Two prison employees were taken hostage and an exercise room was burned.\par \par \uc2 Six weeks later, another riot left black smoke billowing from the sprawling complex for days. The Geo Group said the disturbance caused "significant" damage and left the facility unable to resume normal operations.\par \par \uc2 Damages to the complex totaled more than $1 million, according to county records.\par \par \uc2 Galindo constantly told guards and staff about his medical condition since arriving in December 2007. He had at least two seizures a month, including a grand mal seizure in November 2008 that required treatment at a local hospital, according to the lawsuit.\par \par \uc2 When Galindo returned to the prison, he was placed in isolation "for compliance of meds," according to the lawsuit. He died in solitary confinement a month later.\par \par \uc2 "Someone from the federal public defender's office, as well as his mother, called RCDC to express concern about his medical treatment and his placement" in solitary confinement, the lawsuit states. "And yet, from November 13 until his death four weeks later, he was never removed from isolation and his medication level was not monitored."\par \par \uc2 Many of the prisoners inside the 3,700-bed complex are non-citizens serving time on immigration charges. The facility sits just off busy Interstate 20 on the outskirts of oil-rich Pecos in Reeves County, just south of the New Mexico border in far western Texas, and has become the county's largest employer.\par \par \uc2 Following the 2008 riots, the ACLU called for a federal investigation into the prison, and reporters swooped into the remote town of 7,700 people to cover the aftermath. The civil rights group said it never received a response.\par \par \uc2 The Geo Group has run the county-owned facility through contracts with Reeves County and the Federal Bureau of Prisons since 2003. Among the 14 prisons the company runs in Texas is a large immigrant detention facility in Pearsall.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101208e6c80023s\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

Galindo died in December 2008 when attorneys say the 32-year-old had an epileptic seizure while in solitary confinement at the Reeves County Detention Center.\par \par \uc2 Galindo was serving a 30-month sentence for illegal re-entry.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - Leaders of New Jersey's largest university and several community colleges are championing federal legislation that would offer \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students a pathway to U.S. citizenship, an issue that could reach a test vote in Congress as early as Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 The presidents of 11 of New Jersey's 19 community colleges, in consultation with their boards of trustees, signed the Dec. 1 letter urging the state's congressional delegation to help pass the Dream Act.\par \par \uc2 The bill would allow young immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally before the age of 16 the chance to legalize their status by completing at least two years of college or military service. They would have to have been here at least five years and graduated from high school, or with an equivalency diploma, to be eligible. The bill would also grant states the power to decide whether to allow students covered by the Dream Act to pay in-state tuition rates.\par \par \uc2 The letter was signed by the presidents of community colleges in the counties of Bergen, Burlington, Camden, Cumberland, Essex, Hudson, Mercer, Middlesex, Passaic, Sussex and Union.\par \par \uc2 Spokespeople for several of the eight community college presidents who did not sign the letter said their boards of trustees had not yet had time to consider the issue.\par \par \uc2 Cid Wilson, the vice-chairman of the board of trustees at Bergen Community College, said although the Dream Act is federal legislation, some felt it was important for the state's community colleges to take a stand, as the system is often the first stop for many undocumented high school graduates whose ineligibility for state or federal aid limits their higher education choices.\par \par \uc2 "Our role is to educate our students, our role is not to engage in overall immigration policy," Wilson said, adding that he signed the letter because he believes the Dream Act would "level the playing field" for undocumented children who attend New Jersey's public schools but are faced with a limited choices after high school.\par \par \uc2 Separately, Rutgers University President Richard McCormick sent a letter to New Jersey's two senators in support of the Dream Act, saying in part he was motivated by hearing of "young people who have grown up in New Jersey, earned good grades in our high schools, and taken an active part in civic life; however, because of their undocumented status, they cannot take the next steps toward a rewarding future."\par \par \uc2 Opponents of the Dream Act say it would reward lawbreaking, overburden the educational system and take classroom seats away from Americans.\par \par \uc2 Prior state legislation similar to the federal bill has failed to pass in New Jersey, and a 2009 Monmouth University/Gannett New Jersey poll found most residents opposed to in-state tuition for undocumented immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Gayle Kessleman of New Jersey Citizens for Immigration Control said the federal legislation does not provide for enough oversight to ensure that people wouldn't exploit it as an easy path to a green card, and that it amounts to "glorified amnesty."\par \par \uc2 "It is fundamentally unfair for the American taxpayer, who is struggling to put his own children through college, to have to pay the freight," Kessleman said. "I understand they (\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students) were brought here through no fault of their own, but it's not the fault of the New Jersey taxpayer."\par \par \uc2 Students like 20-year-old Piash Ahamed, who emigrated legally with his family from Bangladesh to New Jersey as a child, and became an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  after his parents lost their bid for asylum, has been lobbying for passage of the measure and similar state legislation.\par \par \uc2 "New Jersey has already invested so much money in me, and other undocumented students that are living here, when we went to elementary, middle school and public high school," Ahamed said. "It doesn't really make any sense for them not to give us an opportunity to finish our education so we can actually get jobs, start paying back, and contribute more through taxes."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101207e6c7002gs\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc92}{\*\bkmkend toc92}\b \uc2 Supreme Court to hear arguments Wednesday over little-used Arizona immigration law\b0\par\par\uc2 By JACQUES BILLEAUD and MARK SHERMAN   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 951 \uc2 words\par \uc2 5 December 2010\par 01:39\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2010.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHOENIX (AP) - The impassioned debate over the nation's immigration policy takes center stage at the Supreme Court Wednesday in a dispute over an Arizona law that punishes employers who knowingly hire workers illegally in the U.S.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors have used Arizona's employer sanctions law just three times in three years, but business interests and civil rights groups, backed by the Obama administration, have banded together to argue that only the federal government may enforce immigration laws.\par \par \uc2 The outcome in this case also could signal how the court would handle the controversial and more expansive Arizona immigration enforcement law, known as SB1070, that the administration challenged and a federal judge blocked key components this summer.\par \par \uc2 "It could take this less visible case and do something that impacts substantially on the SB1070 litigation by making some broader observations," said Peter Spiro, who teaches immigration law at Temple University's law school.\par \par \uc2 The employer sanctions law was intended to diminish Arizona's role as the nation's hub for immigrant smuggling by requiring employers to verify the eligibility of new workers through a federal database. Employers convicted of violating the law can have their business licenses suspended or revoked.\par \par \uc2 A survey by The Associated Press of all county prosecutor offices in Arizona found that out of the 101 employer sanctions complaints lodged since the law took effect in January 2008, three have led to civil cases being filed against employers.\par \par \uc2 But dozens of business raids in metropolitan Phoenix during employer sanctions investigations have led to the arrests of 131 workers who are illegal immigrants on criminal charges, such as using forged documents or stolen identities to get jobs. The law intended to target employers has been used more often against workers.\par \par \uc2 Supporters said the law was needed because the federal government has done a lousy job of enforcing a similar federal law. They also say the state rules have discouraged countless employers from hiring illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Business and civil rights groups challenged the law as a clear and unconstitutional attempt to preempt federal authority.\par \par \uc2 Lawyers for the state argued that while a similar federal hiring law prevents states from imposing civil or criminal penalties against businesses for illegal hirings, the federal law allows states to take licensing actions against violators.\par \par \uc2 A federal judge in Phoenix and the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the law. The Obama administration urged the Supreme Court in May to take up employer sanctions. About a month later, the U.S. Justice Department filed a lawsuit asking a judge to invalidate Arizona's latest immigration law.\par \par \uc2 A judge put on hold the law's most controversial sections. The blocked sections include requirements that immigrants carry immigration registration papers and that local police, while enforcing other laws, question the immigration status of those they suspect are in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 The Supreme Court hasn't taken up the question of whether states and communities can participate in immigration enforcement since 1976, and observers have expected it to enter the fray.\par \par \uc2 Steven Shapiro, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, said the outcome of the employer sanctions case could signal how the court would deal with the broader Arizona immigration law. "If the Arizona statute is struck down on pre-emption grounds, it's very hard to imagine SB1070 surviving," said Shapiro, whose group challenged both laws in court.\par \par \uc2 State Sen. Russell Pearce, who authored both laws, predicted the statutes, in the end, will be upheld. "It's about states' rights: Arizona's right to enforce the law, the right to protect American jobs, the right to protect Arizona's borders, the right to protect Arizona's neighborhoods," Pearce said.\par \par \uc2 Supporters say the employer sanctions law is a success because more businesses are running checks on prospective workers. They argue that it has led an unknown number of illegal immigrants to leave the state.\par \par \uc2 Two of the three civil cases against employers have been settled.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHOENIX (AP) - The impassioned debate over the nation's immigration policy takes center stage at the Supreme Court Wednesday in a dispute over an Arizona law that punishes employers who knowingly hire workers illegally in the U.S.\par \par \uc2 Arizona's employer sanctions law has been used just three times in three years, but business interests and civil rights groups, backed by the Obama administration, have banded together to argue that only the federal government may enforce immigration laws.\par \par \uc2 The outcome in this case also could signal how the court would handle the controversial and more expansive Arizona immigration enforcement law, known as SB1070, that the administration challenged and a federal judge blocked key components this summer.\par \par \uc2 "It could take this less visible case and do something that impacts substantially on the SB1070 litigation by making some broader observations," said Peter Spiro, who teaches immigration law at Temple University's law school.\par \par \uc2 The employer sanctions law was intended to diminish Arizona's role as the nation's hub for immigrant smuggling by requiring employers to verify the eligibility of new workers through a federal database. Employers convicted of violating the law can have their business licenses suspended or revoked.\par \par \uc2 A survey by The Associated Press of all county prosecutor offices in Arizona found that out of the 101 employer sanctions complaints lodged since the law took effect in January 2008, three have led to civil cases being filed against employers.\par \par \uc2 But dozens of business raids in metropolitan Phoenix during employer sanctions investigations have led to the arrests of 131 workers who are illegal immigrants on criminal charges, such as using forged documents or stolen identities to get jobs. The law intended to target employers has been used more often against workers.\par \par \uc2 Supporters said the law was needed because the federal government has done a lousy job of enforcing a similar federal law. They also say the state rules have discouraged countless employers from hiring illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Business and civil rights groups challenged the law as a clear and unconstitutional attempt to preempt federal authority.\par \par \uc2 Lawyers for the state argued that while a similar federal hiring law prevents states from imposing civil or criminal penalties against businesses for illegal hirings, the federal law allows states to take licensing actions against violators.\par \par \uc2 A federal judge in Phoenix and the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the law. The Obama administration urged the Supreme Court in May to take up employer sanctions. About a month later, the U.S. Justice Department filed a lawsuit asking a judge to invalidate Arizona's latest immigration law.\par \par \uc2 A judge put on hold the law's most controversial sections. The blocked sections include requirements that immigrants carry immigration registration papers and that local police, while enforcing other laws, question the immigration status of those they suspect are in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 The Supreme Court hasn't taken up the question of whether states and communities can participate in immigration enforcement since 1976, and observers have expected it to enter the fray.\par \par \uc2 Steven Shapiro, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, said the outcome of the employer sanctions case could signal how the court would deal with the broader Arizona immigration law. "If the Arizona statute is struck down on pre-emption grounds, it's very hard to imagine SB1070 surviving," said Shapiro, whose group challenged both laws in court.\par \par \uc2 State Sen. Russell Pearce, who authored both laws, predicted the statutes, in the end, will be upheld. "It's about states' rights: Arizona's right to enforce the law, the right to protect American jobs, the right to protect Arizona's borders, the right to protect Arizona's neighborhoods," Pearce said.\par \par \uc2 Supporters say the employer sanctions law is a success because more businesses are running checks on prospective workers. They argue that it has led an unknown number of illegal immigrants to leave the state.\par \par \uc2 Two of the three civil cases against employers have been settled. A now-defunct amusement park that acknowledged violating the law will have its business license suspended for 10 days if it reopens. A sandwich shop that admitted to a violation agreed to close its doors for two days.\par \par \uc2 A case is pending against a custom furniture business that's accused of using a subcontractor who was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  to get around the law's ban on illegal hirings. The furniture maker denies the allegations.\par \par \uc2 One difficulty cited by prosecutors in bringing cases against employers is the law's failure to give them civil subpoena power to make suspected violators hand over records and give testimony. Another barrier is the standard of proof: Prosecutors must prove that businesses knew they were hiring illegal workers.\par \par \uc2 "Most of them were unfounded on their faces without proper evidence of illegal hiring, and some of them had some merit but with a lack of subpoena power to get employer records, we couldn't do the follow-up," said Jace Zack, chief deputy for the Mohave County Attorney's Office, of the 33 complaints his office has received since the law took effect.\par \par \uc2 Glenn Hamer, chief executive of the Arizona Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which challenged the employer sanctions law in court, believes the law has been enforced in a reasonable manner and hasn't discouraged out-of-state businesses from locating here, though he acknowledged it's not exactly a selling point.\par \par \uc2 "I wouldn't say that it has appeared on the front of the brochure of any economic development organization in the state," Hamer said.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Sherman reported from Washington.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101204e6c4001pe\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

(AP) -- Segdwick County prosecutors have added a new felony charge against a 26-year-old wounded veteran accused of targeting members of a Topeka church known for protesting at soldiers' funerals.\par \par \uc2 Ryan Newell of Marion was charged Thursday with five misdemeanor counts for allegedly following members of the Westboro Baptist Church after a protest in Mulvane on Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 On Friday, prosecutors added the felony of conspiracy to commit aggravated battery, accusing Newell of engaging in a conspiracy in which firearms were obtained and put in his vehicle and taken to a place where church members gathered.\par \par \uc2 Newell's lawyer, Boyd McPherson, said he's working to get Newell out of jail. He's held on $500,000 bond.\par \par \uc2 Church members protest at soldiers' funerals, saying they feel U.S. soldiers' deaths are God's punishment for American immorality.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Football player's death points to screening limits\par \par \uc2 KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Nathan Stiles' parents had little reason to doubt their 17-year-old son was ready to return to the football field after suffering an apparent concussion at the homecoming game. He spent weeks resting, and a doctor gave him the all clear to play again. Even a CT scan that usually detects more serious head injuries came back negative, his mother said.\par \par \uc2 The Spring Hill High School senior died in late October, a day after collapsing on the sidelines at a game. A county coroner determined this week that the running back and linebacker died of a rare but severe brain injury that likely occurred during the earlier game but went undetected.\par \par \uc2 The suburban Kansas City school district says it followed new rules designed to reduce concussion risks. But in an era of heightened awareness about player safety and head injuries, family, school and medical experts are left wondering if anything more could have been done to prevent his death.\par \par \uc2 "It's tragic," said Rick Bowden, assistant executive director of the Kansas State High School Activities Association. "But I don't know if anything could have been done differently. When a doctor releases a student to return to participate, what more can we ask?"\par \par \uc2 Football organizations at every level from the youth Pop Warner leagues to the National Football League are tightening the rules and procedures in an effort to prevent head injuries. Players are routinely fined for dangerous tackles in the NFL, and high school coaches are urged to keep players off the field when a head injury is suspected. On Thursday, the head of the Consumer Product Safety Commission told Congress her agency is working to improve the safety of football helmets to better prevent head injuries.\par \par \uc2 Effective this fall, any high school player who shows signs, symptoms or behaviors associated with a concussion must be removed from the game and cannot return until cleared by an appropriate health care professional. The concussion rule was approved by the National Federation of State High School Associations and adopted in Kansas and elsewhere.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Gill confident Kansas will be better\par \par \uc2 LAWRENCE, Kan. (AP) -- Turner Gill is judging his first season as Kansas football coach as a rough and often unpleasant learning experience for him, his staff and his players.\par \par \uc2 Now that everyone has a better idea of what to expect, things will certainly get better. That was the message Friday in a season wrap-up session with the media where Gill as much as promised significant improvement next season from the 3-9 campaign of 2010.\par \par \uc2 "I mentioned in my first press conference here that I was here to build a winning dynasty at the University of Kansas," Gill said. "That has not changed. There are some great things for our fans to be excited about."\par \par \uc2 There will be plenty of new faces next season in Memorial Stadium. The Jayhawks said goodbye last week in a 35-7 loss to Missouri to 20 seniors, a group that experienced the 12-1 Orange Bowl season of 2007 as well as the miserable years of 2009 and '10.\par \par \uc2 In the Big 12, the Jayhawks were 1-7, beating only Colorado. Gill's main goal next year is to make sure the Jayhawks have a quicker getaway.\par \par \uc2 "I want to make sure we're more explosive," he said. "All the players we bring in here, they need to have some explosive movement. It doesn't necessarily mean we have to be fast. But we need guys to have a suddenness, a burst, being able to explode into contact, whether they're offensive linemen or whatever."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Immigrant students give blood to show citizenship\par \par \uc2 BOSTON (AP) -- Immigrant advocates have staged sit-ins, held rallies and gone on hunger strikes in recent days in an 11th hour bid to get Congress to pass legislation that would give illegal immigrants a pathway to citizenship by going to college or serving in the military.\par \par \uc2 As Congress gets closers to a possible vote on the bill, called the DREAM Act, college-aged illegal immigrants are literally shedding blood for the cause.\par \par \uc2 On Friday, a group of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  college students, or "DREAMers" as they called themselves, donated blood at Harvard University and other colleges. The students said they wanted to show the rest of the country that they are ready to perform community service and are good citizens, even if they don't have U.S. citizenship.\par \par \uc2 "As someone who is undocumented ... I'm not scared about giving blood," said Megha Sharma, 22, whose family came to Massachusetts from India seven years ago and who donated blood Friday for the first time. "I'm scared about the vote in Congress."\par \par \uc2 The DREAM Act is in the pile of legislation awaiting action in the final days of the current Congress.\par \par \uc2 Myrna Orozco, a 20-year-old from Kansas City, Mo., who is spearheading the national effort, said supporters have been donating blood in the name of the cause for about two weeks. So far, she said "DREAMers" have given blood in California, Kansas, Kentucky, Missouri, Texas and Virginia, with more states targeted in the coming days.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 EPA reports stormwater violations on US 59 project\par \par \uc2 KANSAS CITY, Kan. (AP) -- The Environmental Protection Agency has told the Kansas Department of Transportation to fix stormwater permit violations for the U.S. 59 project in Douglas and Franklin counties.\par \par \uc2 The EPA's regional office in Kanas City, Kan., said in a release that inspectors visited the highway construction site in August and found numerous areas where there wasn't enough -- or any -- sediment control. The EPA said several areas lacked silt fencing, berms or other means of controlling sediment moved by stormwater runoff. The order requires KDOT to report in a month to EPA with what it has done to fix the violations.\par \par \uc2 The EPA said stormwater and runoff from the project carries sediment and contaminants into unnamed tributaries of the West Fork of Tauy Creek and the Wakarusa River.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Secretary of Kansas revenue department to resign\par \par \uc2 TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) -- Joan Wagnon, the secretary of the Kansas Department of Revenue, plans to retire when a new administration takes office in January, but she said she doesn't plan to start taking life easy.\par \par \uc2 Wagnon, who was also mayor of Topeka and a Kansas House member, said Thursday that she was proud of the work she's done since being appointed to the state tax agency by Democratic Gov. Kathleen Sebelius in 2003. But she said with Republican Gov. Sam Brownback taking office next month, she is looking for something "interesting to do."\par \par \uc2 "I signed on for eight years, and that eight years ends on January 10th. I plan to work until the last day. I have loved it. Just loved it," Wagnon told The Topeka Capital-Journal.\par \par \uc2 When she was appointed to the revenue department, it "wasn't at the top of everyone's favorite list." In particular, the Kansas Society of Certified Public Accountants had the department on its "hit list," Wagnon said.\par \par \uc2 "I think we've established a real partnership with them," Wagnon said. "The department has a good reputation for customer service."\par \par \uc2 Bob Clubine of Salina, chairman of the Liaison Committee of the Public Accountants Association of Kansas Inc., agreed. And he said Wagnon had been instrumental in encouraging more Kansans to file their tax returns electronically.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Gov. Parkinson rejects payment offer from PETA\par \par \uc2 TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) -- An animal rights group is offering to help the state with its persistent budget problems -- but with a catch.\par \par \uc2 People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals on Thursday offered to pay the state to erect an anti-fishing sign at Miami State Fishing Lake in Fontana. The group said it would then pay rent for the sign as long as the state left it up, although it did not propose a specific rent amount.\par \par \uc2 The sign shows a dog with a fish hook through its lip and reads, "If You Wouldn't Do This to a Dog, Why Do It to a Fish?," The Lawrence-Journal World reported.\par \par \uc2 However, Gov. Mark Parkinson was not hooked by the idea. He declined the offer through a spokeswoman, saying that the state's budget woes will require "more substantial solutions."\par \par \uc2 Some state legislators have discussed the possibility of the state selling some assets, such as office buildings and state-owned land, to address a $500 million revenue deficit.\par \par \uc2 "Our proposal would help Kansas stave off the sale of valuable assets and help the fish in Miami State Fishing Lake live in peace," said PETA Executive Vice President Tracy Reiman.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Kan. man arrested after laser aimed at helicopter\par \par \uc2 OVERLAND PARK, Kan. (AP) -- A 21-year-old suburban Kansas City man is facing possible federal charges after he allegedly aimed a laser at a police helicopter, temporarily blinding the pilot.\par \par \uc2 Kansas City police say they pulled over the Overland Park man Wednesday night after a passenger aimed the laser at the police helicopter, which was hovering over a traffic accident on Interstate 435.\par \par \uc2 Police Sgt. Tony Mack told The Kansas City Star that lasers can blind pilots because the dot becomes larger over long distances and the light illuminates the entire cockpit. He says the pilot had to shield his eyes because the light was so bright.\par \par \uc2 The pilot radioed to officers on the ground to pull over the suspect's pickup truck. The passenger told police he wanted to see if the laser could hit the helicopter.\par \par \uc2 --------\par \par \uc2 Information from: The Kansas City Star, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.kansascity.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.kansascity.com}}}\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Landowners sue Ellis County over wind farm zoning\par \par \uc2 ELLIS, Kan. (AP) -- More than two dozen landowners and a prospective developer are suing the Ellis County Commission over zoning regulations they claim will essentially prevent wind farm development on their land.\par \par \uc2 The federal complaint, which was filed in September and amended on Tuesday, is seeking to have zoning regulations the commission approved in August declared void.\par \par \uc2 The Hays Daily News reports nearly all of the plaintiffs in the case have signed agreements to develop wind energy on their properties.\par \par \uc2 The regulations adopted Aug. 30 include increased setbacks and impose a 40-decibel noise limit.\par \par \uc2 Another group of landowners in a proposed wind project southwest of Hays sued Ellis County in district court in 2008 over setbacks in that project. Changes reached after mediation were completed earlier this year.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101204e6c40010b\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Saturday, December 4, 2010\par \par \uc2 APNewsBreak: Mo. has $1M in tax credit penalties\par \par \uc2 JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Missouri has levied more than $1 million of penalties against dozens of tax credit recipients for violating a state reporting law intended to gauge whether their projects actually are producing the promised results.\par \par \uc2 Records provided Friday to The Associated Press show 56 business entities, nonprofit groups and individuals have failed to comply with a 2004 state law requiring annual progress reports after receiving tax credits.\par \par \uc2 The state economic development and revenue agencies initially refused to release the identities of those penalized. But the Department of Economic Development reversed course Friday after the AP contacted Gov. Jay Nixon's office for comment about whether he believed the records should be kept secret.\par \par \uc2 The list of tax credit recipients flouting the reporting requirements include major employers, such as \uc2 Harley-Davidson Motor Co\uc2 ., as well as numerous developers who got historic preservation tax credits to remodel old buildings. A spokesman for \uc2 Harley-Davidson\uc2  attributed the problem to a paperwork mix-up.\par \par \uc2 Some of Missouri's tax credit programs -- including ones for housing developments and historic renovation projects --are among the most generous in the nation. The state waives more than $500 million of income taxes annually as incentives for developers, businesses and social causes such as food panties and domestic violence shelters.\par \par \uc2 A commission appointed by Nixon recommended this week that lawmakers should end almost half the state's tax credit programs and revamp many of the remaining ones, cutting the total cost to the state by as much as $220 million a year. If enacted, it would mark the most sweeping changes to the programs since the Tax Credit Accountability Act of 2004.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Mo. gov. cancels trade trip to Taiwan, S. Korea\par \par \uc2 JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon has canceled a trade trip to Taiwan and South Korea.\par \par \uc2 The governor's office on Friday cited "travel challenges." A spokesman declined to elaborate. It was not known if the trade trip would be rescheduled.\par \par \uc2 There have been tensions between North Korea and South Korea since North Korea shelled a South Korean island last month. Two civilians and two marines died.\par \par \uc2 Nixon had planned to be overseas from Dec. 10 to Dec. 16. He was to start in Taiwan and travel to South Korea on Dec. 14. The governor was traveling with his wife, two state department directors, business leaders and several trade and agriculture groups.\par \par \uc2 On Friday, the U.S. and South Korea agreed to the largest trade pact in more than a decade.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Omaha billboards herald Jesus' return in May\par \par \uc2 OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- A Christian group is proclaiming Jesus' impending return in billboards going up in Omaha and other U.S. cities for the holiday season.\par \par \uc2 Allison Warden, one of the founders of Raleigh, N.C.-based We Can Know, said Wednesday that an analysis of Scripture, particularly the genealogies, shows Jesus will come in May.\par \par \uc2 "God actually provides a calendar that points to May 21, 2011, as the day for Christ to return," she said.\par \par \uc2 Warden said the billboards she designed -- showing three wise men on camels following the star of Bethlehem -- are meant to spur the public's interest in the Bible, not frighten anyone.\par \par \uc2 "Obviously we don't want anyone to take our word for any of this," she said.\par \par \uc2 The billboards have already gone up in Omaha and Nashville, Tenn. They're also planned for Atlanta, Bridgeport, Conn.; Detroit; Fort Wayne, Ind.; Kansas City, Mo.; Little Rock, Ark.; Louisville, Ky.; and St. Louis, Warden said. They'll stay up for the month of December.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Immigrant students give blood to show citizenship\par \par \uc2 BOSTON (AP) -- Immigrant advocates have staged sit-ins, held rallies and gone on hunger strikes in recent days in an 11th hour bid to get Congress to pass legislation that would give illegal immigrants a pathway to citizenship by going to college or serving in the military.\par \par \uc2 As Congress gets closers to a possible vote on the bill, called the DREAM Act, college-aged illegal immigrants are literally shedding blood for the cause.\par \par \uc2 On Friday, a group of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  college students, or "DREAMers" as they called themselves, donated blood at Harvard University and other colleges. The students said they wanted to show the rest of the country that they are ready to perform community service and are good citizens, even if they don't have U.S. citizenship.\par \par \uc2 "As someone who is undocumented ... I'm not scared about giving blood," said Megha Sharma, 22, whose family came to Massachusetts from India seven years ago and who donated blood Friday for the first time. "I'm scared about the vote in Congress."\par \par \uc2 The DREAM Act is in the pile of legislation awaiting action in the final days of the current Congress.\par \par \uc2 Myrna Orozco, a 20-year-old from Kansas City, Mo., who is spearheading the national effort, said supporters have been donating blood in the name of the cause for about two weeks. So far, she said "DREAMers" have given blood in California, Kansas, Kentucky, Missouri, Texas and Virginia, with more states targeted in the coming days.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Businessmen brothers ordered to prison in tax case\par \par \uc2 ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Two brothers who run several St. Louis businesses each were ordered to spend a year and a day in federal prison on tax-evasion charges.\par \par \uc2 A federal judge in St. Louis on Friday also sentenced William Bialczak to $100,000 in fines and $370,000 in restitution to the Internal Revenue Service. That payback will be taken out of $500,000 the government seized when it raided the brothers' St. Louis Metropolitan Towing company in August 2008.\par \par \uc2 Kenneth Bialczak was fined $75,000 and must make similar IRS restitution.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors say the brothers' Metropolitan Towing, Parks Auto Sales and S&H Parking Systems generated large amounts of cash, including a towing contract with St. Louis police.\par \par \uc2 The Bialczaks admitted that in 2005 and 2006, gross receipts for their businesses were underreported by about $1 million.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Man accused in sex-slave case facing gun charges\par \par \uc2 ST. LOUIS (AP) -- A suburban St. Louis man, one of five accused of torturing and mutilating a runaway teen who authorities say was a sex slave for years, faces new federal charges that he illegally possessed a cache of guns.\par \par \uc2 Federal grand jurors in St. Louis indicted 32-two-year-old Bradley Cook of Kirkwood on Thursday on a felony charge that he unlawfully transported firearms including a Czech-made rifle, shotguns and pistols last December.\par \par \uc2 Cook remains in federal custody on charges filed in Kansas City in the alleged sex-slave case, but is challenging that detainment and wants to be released. Federal prosecutors in St. Louis are pressing to have Cook ordered to stay behind bars pending trial on the weapons count, casting the man as a dangerous threat to the community and a "serious" flight risk.\par \par \uc2 Thursday's charge likely will replace a Kansas City weapons count, which Cook's attorneys are seeking to have thrown out on claims it wrongly asserts Cook possessed the guns in western Missouri, where he's never lived. The guns actually were seized from Cook's home, on the other side of the state.\par \par \uc2 Online court records Friday did not list an attorney for Cook on the latest charge. Carter Law, Cook's St. Louis lawyer in the sex case, declined to comment publicly Friday.\par \par \uc2 Cook has pleaded not guilty to conspiracy, sex trafficking, racketeering and weapons charges in the sex case. He faces a possible life sentence if convicted of the trafficking count.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Mo. S&T to award first master's in explosives\par \par \uc2 ROLLA, Mo. (AP) -- The nation's first master's degrees in explosives engineering will be handed out this month at Missouri University of Science and Technology in Rolla.\par \par \uc2 The university said the program was approved last year and is part of Missouri S&T's mining and nuclear engineering department. Fifteen graduate students are enrolled in Missouri S&T's explosives engineering program.\par \par \uc2 The degrees will be handed out to three students on Dec. 18.\par \par \uc2 Missouri S&T started offering a minor in explosives engineering at the undergraduate level in 2005.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Plans for $48 million Joplin Arts Center unveiled\par \par \uc2 JOPLIN, Mo. (AP) -- Proponents have unveiled plans for a new $48 million arts and entertainment center in Joplin.\par \par \uc2 Consultant Halsey North showed the plans for the Joplin Regional Arts & Entertainment Center Thursday to a roomful of community leaders.\par \par \uc2 North, a New York consultant, says the plans are only a vision and the southwest Missouri city will have to decide how elaborate a center it wants to build.\par \par \uc2 North says the 150,000-square foot performing and visual arts center could house a 1,200-seat auditorium for touring shows, a 500-seat theater and a center for the arts. The three-story building also would have offices for the Joplin Area Chamber of Commerce and could include rooms for convention and meetings.\par \par \uc2 The Joplin Globe reports that North says the city also could build an amphitheater and renovate the nearby Union Depot. The proposal also includes green space in the area.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Kan. man arrested after laser aimed at helicopter\par \par \uc2 OVERLAND PARK, Kan. (AP) -- A 21-year-old suburban Kansas City man is facing possible federal charges after he allegedly aimed a laser at a police helicopter, temporarily blinding the pilot.\par \par \uc2 Kansas City police say they pulled over the Overland Park man Wednesday night after a passenger aimed the laser at the police helicopter, which was hovering over a traffic accident on Interstate 435.\par \par \uc2 Police Sgt. Tony Mack told The Kansas City Star that lasers can blind pilots because the dot becomes larger over long distances and the light illuminates the entire cockpit. He says the pilot had to shield his eyes because the light was so bright.\par \par \uc2 The pilot radioed to officers on the ground to pull over the suspect's pickup truck. The passenger told police he wanted to see if the laser could hit the helicopter.\par \par \uc2 --------\par \par \uc2 Information from: The Kansas City Star, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.kansascity.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.kansascity.com}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101204e6c4000w1\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 NEW YORK (AP) - A teenage actress has dropped her claim that Nickelodeon massively underpaid her for lending her voice to the plucky cartoon heroine of "Dora The Explorer," and the network said Friday she would do some more work on the pioneering children's show.\par \par \uc2 Caitlin Sanchez agreed to dismiss her lawsuit against the network and its corporate parents last month, federal court records show. Nickelodeon said Friday that Caitlin would finish some future episodes. The network declined to say how many or otherwise detail its arrangement with the Fairview, N.J., teen.\par \par \uc2 "We have always felt, and continue to feel, that Caitlin is a very talented performer," the network said in a statement. "Our intention was always that Caitlin complete the episodes on which she worked, and we are pleased that she has agreed to do so."\par \par \uc2 Caitlin's lawyer, John Balestriere, would say only that the lawsuit was withdrawn after discussions.\par \par \uc2 The dismissal ends a sniping dispute over behind-the-scenes business at the chipper children's series. Caitlin's lawsuit accused family oriented Nickelodeon of cheating a hardworking high school student out of millions of dollars; the network at one point said the 14-year-old had vocally outgrown her perennially 7-year-old character.\par \par \uc2 "Dora The Explorer" is in its 10th year. It broke ground in U.S. children's television by featuring a bilingual, Latina heroine and quickly became a cultural touchstone.\par \par \uc2 Caitlin has given voice to Dora since 2007, leading viewers on whimsical adventures that also help teach English and Spanish.\par \par \uc2 Her lawsuit said she made $5,115 per episode but didn't get the fees she was due for reruns, recordings for DVDs and other Dora products and hundreds of hours of promotional work.\par \par \uc2 Nickelodeon, owned by \uc2 Viacom Inc\uc2 ., initially said Caitlin was well compensated, and her "voice changed and she was no longer able to portray the Dora character" -- a claim her camp disputed.\par \par \uc2 The show averages 1.9 million viewers for each episode and has generated more than $11 billion in sales of related toys, books and DVDs worldwide since 2002. Dora is a balloon in the \uc2 Macy's\uc2  Thanksgiving Day Parade and briefly became a cartoon poster child for the nationwide debate over immigration after a doctored photo of her behind bars as a suspected \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  made the rounds online this year.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101203e6c3002zb\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 BOSTON (AP) - Immigrant advocates have staged sit-ins, held rallies and gone on hunger strikes in recent days in an 11th hour bid to get Congress to pass legislation that would give illegal immigrants a pathway to citizenship by going to college or serving in the military.\par \par \uc2 As Congress gets closers to a possible vote on the bill, called the DREAM Act, college-aged illegal immigrants are literally shedding blood for the cause.\par \par \uc2 On Friday, a group of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  college students, or "DREAMers" as they called themselves, donated blood at Harvard University and other colleges. The students said they wanted to show the rest of the country that they are ready to perform community service and are good citizens, even if they don't have U.S. citizenship.\par \par \uc2 "As someone who is undocumented ... I'm not scared about giving blood," said Megha Sharma, 22, whose family came to Massachusetts from India seven years ago and who donated blood Friday for the first time. "I'm scared about the vote in Congress."\par \par \uc2 The DREAM Act is in the pile of legislation awaiting action in the final days of the current Congress.\par \par \uc2 Myrna Orozco, a 20-year-old from Kansas City, Mo., who is spearheading the national effort, said supporters have been donating blood in the name of the cause for about two weeks. So far, she said "DREAMers" have given blood in California, Kansas, Kentucky, Missouri, Texas and Virginia, with more states targeted in the coming days.\par \par \uc2 Orozco, who was brought to the U.S. from Mexico as a child, donated blood Friday at Donnelly College in Kansas City, Kansas, where she is a student.\par \par \uc2 "I'm type O," she said. "So everybody can take my blood."\par \par \uc2 Nothing prevents illegal immigrants from giving blood and blood-collection workers don't check immigration status, said Red Cross spokeswoman Stephanie Millian. She said all blood donors just need to show identification and fill out health questionnaires.\par \par \uc2 Steve Kropper, co-director of the Massachusetts Coalition for Immigration Reform, a bipartisan group that seeks immigration reductions, said the whole episode showed that authorities have the tools to identify immigrants who were unlawfully in the country.\par \par \uc2 "This is a missed opportunity. We know where they are enrolled in school. We know where they live," said Kropper. "Shouldn't we be taking advantage of this?"\par \par \uc2 Renata Teodoro, 22, who led the delegation to the blood drive at Harvard University, said the idea of donating blood came after immigrant students started calling on each other to promote good citizenship by performing community service during the holidays.\par \par \uc2 "DREAMers all over have been doing community services," said Teodoro, who was a child when her family unlawfully brought her to the U.S. from Brazil. "We want to continue giving back to this country because we do love this country and we do consider ourselves to be Americans. We're just fighting for our right to be acknowledged as Americans."\par \par \uc2 In addition to donating blood, student immigrants are volunteering at homeless shelters and donating turkeys at holiday food drives. Orozco said one group in Kentucky held a food drive outside a congressman's office and then went to donate blood next door.\par \par \uc2 "This is not the first time I'm donating," said Elizabeth Ponce, 20, who gave blood at Harvard. "It probably won't be the last."\par \par \uc2 U.S. Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., said the students "are reminding everyone what it really means to be an American."\par \par \uc2 "Only three in a hundred Americans will ever donate blood despite the need, but these kids are living out the real full measure of citizenship," he said. "They're living, breathing testimony of the importance of passing the DREAM Act."\par \par \uc2 Marie Parente, a former Massachusetts state representative who opposed efforts to give the state's illegal immigrants in-state tuition, said the blood donation drive did little to change her opinion that the DREAM Act was wrong. She compared illegal immigrants donating blood to win sympathy with serial killers donating blood to get off death row.\par \par \uc2 "What if a guy on death row says 'I'll give you a pint of blood for the rest of my life ... just get me out of here'?" said Parente, 82, of Milford. "It's baseless."\par \par \uc2 Orozco said \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students have nothing in common with criminals and the immigrants are just seeking to go to college or join the military.\par \par \uc2 "Our blood is just as good as other people's blood," said Orozco.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101203e6c3002x7\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

But after he flew in secrecy for 14 hours to get here, foul weather kept him from nearby Kabul and a meeting to address frayed relations with Afghan President Hamid Karzai\par \par \uc2 Obama's surprise visit to the war zone, his second as president, came 10 days before he is to address the nation about a new review of U.S. strategy to defeat the Taliban and strengthen the Afghan government so American troops can begin leaving next year.\par \par \uc2 The trip also came at a particularly awkward moment in already strained U.S. relations with Afghanistan because of new and embarrassing leaked cables alleging widespread fraud and underscoring deep American concerns about Karzai.\par \par \uc2 There was no mention of that as the president spoke to more than 3,500 service members packed into a huge airplane hangar. After his remarks, he spent more than 10 minutes shaking hands, going around the hangar three times as they grabbed his hand and held cameras and cell phones high to take photos.\par \par \uc2 Obama stayed on this U.S. military base, the headquarters of the 101st Airborne Division, the entire time he was here, just under four hours. He huddled with U.S. Gen. David Petraeus, the top NATO commander in Afghanistan and U.S. Ambassador Karl Eikenberry. And he visited wounded soldiers at a base hospital, personally dispensing five Purple Hearts to wounded service members.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 With unemployment rising, John Boehner vows GOP will show the way toward extending tax cuts\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) -- With unemployment rising, incoming House Speaker John Boehner vowed Friday that Republicans will show the way toward extending tax cuts in 2011 if the outgoing Democrats fail to do it sooner.\par \par \uc2 Boehner, R-Ohio, made his comment as partisan wrangling in the Senate slowed attempts to pass legislation ensuring that tax cuts enacted in 2001 and 2003 don't expire.\par \par \uc2 The White House has signaled that President Barack Obama is prepared to sign a bill extending tax cuts at all levels, as Republicans want. At the same time, Democrats want the bill to include an extension of unemployment benefits for the long-term unemployed, renewal of tax provisions benefiting college students, companies that hire the jobless and lower- and middle-income workers, even if they don't make enough to pay federal taxes.\par \par \uc2 Additionally, private talks include a possible increase in the debt limit to permit the Treasury to borrow funds needed to meet its obligations.\par \par \uc2 But Senate Democrats, who propose allowing tax cuts to lapse for the upper income, accused Republicans of favoring millionaires and billionaires at the expense of the middle class.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Marines, Army ask Congress not to lift gay ban now, saying it's too risky during war\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bucking the Pentagon's top leaders, the chiefs of the Army and Marines urged Congress on Friday not to allow openly gay people to serve in the military, at least not while troops are at war in Afghanistan.\par \par \uc2 The generals publicly rebutted their own bosses and the White House, arguing that it is too risky to change the policy now. That gave political ammunition to congressional Republicans trying to retain the ban known as "don't ask, don't tell."\par \par \uc2 "It's important that we're clear about the military risks," said Gen. George Casey, the Army's top officer. "Repeal of 'don't ask, don't tell' would be a major cultural and policy change in the middle of a war."\par \par \uc2 President Barack Obama has promised to jettison a policy he says is discriminatory, and asked Congress to repeal the 17-year-old law this year. Chances of that were slim to begin with, and they sank lower after Friday's blunt assessment that lifting the ban would tear the close bonds of the foxhole. Democrats have promised a vote this month.\par \par \uc2 Both Casey and Marine Corps Commandant Gen. James Amos undercut Defense Secretary Robert Gates' claim that the change is not too dangerous. Their views are the most closely watched because the Army and Marines are doing most of the fighting in Afghanistan, and did the same in Iraq.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Obama commission's debt-reduction fails to gain enough panel support to advance to Congress\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Barack Obama's budget deficit commission failed to garner enough support Friday to prompt quick congressional action on its austere spending blueprint. But the support of a bipartisan majority of the panel should give it momentum.\par \par \uc2 Commission members said that by winning over 11 of the 18 panelists, they had defied expectations. They said it showed that Washington is capable of having an "adult conversation" on a bipartisan basis about the painful choices required to avert a European-style debt crisis.\par \par \uc2 Devout Senate conservatives Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, and Tom Coburn, R-Okla., joined with close Obama allies Sens. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., and Kent Conrad, D-N.D., in support of the plan. Panel members said the commission's work has fundamentally changed the national debate on the deficit\par \par \uc2 The plan received "aye" votes from five of six senators who served on the 18-member panel, chaired by former White House chief of staff Erskine Bowles and former Wyoming Sen. Alan Simpson of the GOP.\par \par \uc2 Obama was more measured, praising the commission for its work and promising to closely study its proposals. He said the nation faces "difficult choices to curb runaway debt."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 WikiLeaks fights to keep the secrets flowing as governments, hackers go after its Web presence\par \par \uc2 LONDON (AP) -- WikiLeaks became an Internet vagabond Friday, moving from one website to another as governments and hackers hounded the organization, trying to deprive it of a direct line to the public.\par \par \uc2 The organization that has embarrassed Washington and foreign leaders by releasing a cache of secret -- and brutally frank -- U.S. diplomatic cables found a new home after an American company stopped directing traffic to wikileaks.org. Then French officials moved to oust it from its new site.\par \par \uc2 By late Friday, WikiLeaks was up in at least three new places.\par \par \uc2 "The first serious infowar is now engaged. The field of battle is WikiLeaks. You are the troops," tweeted John Perry Barlow, co-founder of the online free-speech group Electronic Frontier Foundation. His message was reposted by WikiLeaks to its 300,000-odd followers.\par \par \uc2 Legal pressure increased on WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange after Swedish authorities revised a warrant for his arrest in response to procedural questions from British officials.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Obama grants first pardons of presidency, to 9 convicted of crimes including drug possession\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Barack Obama has granted the first pardons of his presidency, to nine people convicted of crimes including possessing drugs, counterfeiting and even mutilating coins.\par \par \uc2 No one well-known was on the list, and some of the crimes dated back decades or had drawn little more than a slap on the wrist in the first place -- such as the Pennsylvania man sentenced in 1963 to probation and a $20 fine for mutilating coins. The White House didn't explain the charge, but tampering with federal currency is a crime.\par \par \uc2 The White House declined to give details on the cases or comment on why these particular people were selected by a president who previously had only pardoned Thanksgiving turkeys.\par \par \uc2 Presidential pardons often come in the holiday season toward year's-end, but they can sometimes be extremely controversial, such as when Bill Clinton pardoned fugitive financier Marc Rich at the end of his presidency.\par \par \uc2 President George W. Bush drew heat for commuting the sentence of I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby, Vice President Dick Cheney's former chief of staff, in the case of the 2003 leak of CIA operative Valerie Plame's identity. But Bush rejected Cheney's vigorous urging that he later pardon Libby as well.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Backers of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 -college bill donate blood in bid to show good citizenship\par \par \uc2 BOSTON (AP) -- Immigrant advocates have staged sit-ins, held rallies and gone on hunger strikes in recent days in an 11th hour bid to get Congress to pass legislation that would give illegal immigrants a pathway to citizenship by going to college or serving in the military.\par \par \uc2 As Congress gets closers to a possible vote on the bill, called the DREAM Act, college-aged illegal immigrants are literally shedding blood for the cause.\par \par \uc2 On Friday, a group of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  college students, or "DREAMers" as they called themselves, donated blood at Harvard University and other colleges. The students said they wanted to show the rest of the country that they are ready to perform community service and are good citizens, even if they don't have U.S. citizenship.\par \par \uc2 "As someone who is undocumented ... I'm not scared about giving blood," said Megha Sharma, 22, whose family came to Massachusetts from India seven years ago and who donated blood Friday for the first time. "I'm scared about the vote in Congress."\par \par \uc2 The DREAM Act is in the pile of legislation awaiting action in the final days of the current Congress.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Canadian charged with killing man with a crossbow in a busy library\par \par \uc2 TORONTO (AP) -- A Canadian man was charged with first-degree murder Friday for fatally shooting his father in the back with a crossbow in a Toronto library as shocked mothers and children watched.\par \par \uc2 Zhou Fang, 24, appeared in court to face the murder charge a day after Si Cheng, 52, was killed in the library about an hour after a nearby school let out for the day. The judge ordered that Fang be held without bail.\par \par \uc2 Toronto police Const. Tony Vella said Cheng was pronounced dead at the scene and Fang was arrested later Thursday in a Toronto suburb.\par \par \uc2 "The use of a crossbow is definitely a unique case in Toronto," said Vella. "You hear about guns, you hear about knives being used, but you definitely don't hear about a crossbow."\par \par \uc2 Earlier Friday police said the two men knew each other, and Vella later confirmed the men were father and son. Police did not say what caused the altercation.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Stop the chocolate chip cookies! Hold the pizza! Bill could quash school bake sales\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) -- Don't touch my brownies! A child nutrition bill on its way to President Barack Obama -- and championed by the first lady -- gives the government power to limit school bake sales and other fundraisers that health advocates say sometimes replace wholesome meals in the lunchroom.\par \par \uc2 Republicans, notably Sarah Palin, and public school organizations decry the bill as an unnecessary intrusion on a common practice often used to raise money.\par \par \uc2 "This could be a real train wreck for school districts," Lucy Gettman of the National School Boards Association said Friday, a day after the House cleared the bill. "The federal government should not be in the business of regulating this kind of activity at the local level."\par \par \uc2 The legislation, part of first lady Michelle Obama's campaign to stem childhood obesity, provides more meals at school for needy kids, including dinner, and directs the Agriculture Department to write guidelines to make those meals healthier. The legislation would apply to all foods sold in schools during regular class hours, including in the cafeteria line, vending machines and at fundraisers.\par \par \uc2 It wouldn't apply to after-hours events or concession stands at sports events.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Chicago Cubs great Ron Santo, longtime radio announcer for perennial losers, dies at 70\par \par \uc2 CHICAGO (AP) -- Ron Santo's love for the Chicago Cubs stretched from his days as a standout third baseman who one season even jumped and clicked his heels to celebrate victories to the two decades he spent unabashedly pulling for his team as a broadcaster.\par \par \uc2 As much as his passion for the Cubbies soothed their long-suffering fans, his play and work in the broadcast booth helped him, too, through tough times and serious ailments, including a bout with diabetes that cost him both legs below the knees. He called the Cubs, simply, his therapy.\par \par \uc2 Santo, who had finished his 21st season broadcasting the Cubs in September, died Thursday night in Arizona from complications of bladder cancer, according to the team and WGN Radio, his longtime employer. He was 70.\par \par \uc2 "Ron was an inspiration to everyone as his life was defined by overcoming obstacles. It is a sad day for all of Chicago and everyone in the sports world," said Chicago Blackhawks president John McDonough, who spent 24 years in the Cubs organization as a marketing guru and later as president. "His incredible passion for the Cubs was unmatched. ...Although we collectively are grieving over his passing, we should also celebrate his incredible life."\par \par \uc2 A nine-time all-star in his 15-year career, Santo hit .277 with 2,254 hits, 342 home runs and 1,331 runs batted in. He also won the Gold Glove award five times.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101203e6c3002cx\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

(AP) -- An elderly couple have been shot to death in the Paris Landing area, and the deaths are being investigated as homicides.\par \par \uc2 According to The Paris Post-Intelligencer, the two were found in their home about 8:40 a.m. Friday. No motive was immediately released.\par \par \uc2 Henry County Sheriff Monte Belew said both victims were in their mid-80s and had lived off Highway 119 since 1999.\par \par \uc2 The paper said the shootings are believed to be related to an earlier incident nearby when a woman called 911 and reported a man had abducted her and held her at gunpoint before she got away.\par \par \uc2 Checkpoints were set up in the area.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Coal companies agree to pay $660,000 in penalties\par \par \uc2 FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) -- The \uc2 Kentucky Energy\uc2  and Environment Cabinet has filed suit against a group of coal companies challenging the validity of environmental reports filed with state regulators.\par \par \uc2 The lawsuit, along with a proposed settlement agreement, was filed Friday in Franklin County Circuit Court.\par \par \uc2 Under the proposal, \uc2 ICG Inc\uc2 . agreed to pay $350,000 in penalties and Frasure Creek Mining agreed to pay $310,000 in penalties.\par \par \uc2 At question is the accuracy of discharge monitoring reports produced for the coal companies by laboratories working under contract.\par \par \uc2 The proposal sets out remedial measures the companies must take to assure valid readings of contaminants in streams.\par \par \uc2 The agreement is subject to approval of a judge.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Omaha billboards herald Jesus' return in May\par \par \uc2 OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- A Christian group is proclaiming Jesus' impending return in billboards going up in Omaha and other U.S. cities for the holiday season.\par \par \uc2 Allison Warden, one of the founders of Raleigh, N.C.-based We Can Know, said Wednesday that an analysis of Scripture, particularly the genealogies, shows Jesus will come in May.\par \par \uc2 "God actually provides a calendar that points to May 21, 2011, as the day for Christ to return," she said.\par \par \uc2 Warden said the billboards she designed -- showing three wise men on camels following the star of Bethlehem -- are meant to spur the public's interest in the Bible, not frighten anyone.\par \par \uc2 "Obviously we don't want anyone to take our word for any of this," she said.\par \par \uc2 The billboards have already gone up in Omaha and Nashville, Tenn. They're also planned for Atlanta, Bridgeport, Conn.; Detroit; Fort Wayne, Ind.; Kansas City, Mo.; Little Rock, Ark.; Louisville, Ky.; and St. Louis, Warden said. They'll stay up for the month of December.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 'DREAM Act' immigrants next move: donate blood\par \par \uc2 BOSTON (AP) -- \uc2 Illegal immigrant\uc2  students say they are ready to shed blood over the "DREAM Act" -- literally.\par \par \uc2 Students are planning to donate blood Friday at Harvard University and other college blood drives. It's part of a nationally organized effort to push a federal proposal in the current Congress that would give some a pathway to citizenship through college enrollment or military service.\par \par \uc2 The immigrant students say the blood donations show they are ready to perform community service and actively demonstrate that they are part of U.S. society.\par \par \uc2 Similar immigrant blood donations have taken place in California, Kansas, Kentucky, Missouri, Texas and Virginia.\par \par \uc2 Red Cross spokeswoman Stephanie Millian says blood donors need to show identification, but blood collection workers don't check immigration status.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101203e6c30028v\par }\par \b \uc2 Search Summary\b0\par \par  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15
