LOZANO   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 668 \uc2 words\par \uc2 2 September 2011\par 13:21\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2011.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 HOUSTON (AP) - A federal jury found a Department of Homeland Security pilot not guilty Friday of lying about his alleged role in the drowning of a would-be \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  swimming across the Rio Grande toward Texas, but couldn't reach a verdict on three other similar counts.\par \par \uc2 Jurors acquitted James Peters on one count of making false statements to federal investigators looking into the 2005 drowning death of Carlos Delgadillo Martinez. A judge declared a mistrial on the three other counts of the same charge.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors accused Peters, 41, of lying about flying his helicopter low in an attempt to force Delgadillo and another person back to Mexico. Officials say the force of the turbulence from the helicopter's rotor blades made Delgadillo lose his grip on an inner tube.\par \par \uc2 But defense attorneys tried to create doubt in the jurors' minds by suggesting that surveillance video prosecutors said showed Peters flying over Delgadillo and the other person was not clear, that it didn't indicate how far above the men the aircraft actually was and that it presented no proof anyone drowned.\par \par \uc2 The jury indicated several times during its deliberations, which began Wednesday, that it couldn't reach a unanimous verdict on all four counts. On Friday, U.S. District Judge Sim Lake resisted prosecutors' efforts to have jurors continue working, saying they had deliberated extensively.\par \par \uc2 Peters, who had faced up to five years in prison if convicted, cried after the judge read the verdict. After the jury left the courtroom, he hugged his wife and three friends, including two other Homeland Security pilots.\par \par \uc2 "He's relieved," said Thomas Berg, one of Peters' attorneys. "He's hoping the government will dismiss the other counts and this nightmare can be over."\par \par \uc2 Federal prosecutors said they respected the jury's verdict and told Lake they would let him know by late next week if they planned to retry Peters on the three undecided counts or drop those charges.\par \par \uc2 "It brings us no joy to prosecute police officers but when we have evidence of police misconduct, we have no choice but to go forward with the prosecution," said prosecutor Ruben Perez.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors had argued that surveillance video clearly showed Peters flew his helicopter over the immigrants, getting as close as 100 feet to an international bridge in Laredo, in an attempt to drive them back to Mexico as they tried crossing into the United States on Dec. 14, 2005. Delgadillo's body was found later that day.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutor Joseph Magliolo said Peters used the helicopter aggressively to force the immigrants back.\par \par \uc2 "It was a case that had to be tried," Magliolo said after the verdict.\par \par \uc2 Berg said Peters should never have been indicted because there was no proof he flew too close to the bridge or that he was lying when he told investigators he didn't recall flying over any individuals near the bridge that day.\par \par \uc2 Berg also said there was no proof of anyone drowning on the video and that additional doubt about whether Peters had anything to do with the drowning was created by testimony from a Border Patrol agent who said at the trial that after the helicopter left, he saw two men get out of the water on the Mexican side of the river.\par \par \uc2 "The jury didn't have enough evidence to make a decision," Berg said. "The jury did its job."\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors acknowledged the border agent's testimony and said it was hard to tell from the video if the inner tube that Delgadillo was holding flipped over. It was unclear if the individuals whom the agent saw getting out of the river were the same ones encountered by the helicopter.\par \par \uc2 Peters, who was suspended without pay after being indicted in January, is currently stationed in Maine. He has worked for Homeland Security since 1997, becoming a helicopter pilot in 2003.\par \par \uc2 5\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110902e792000s1\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) - A New Mexico judge blocked Republican Gov. Susana Martinez's administration Wednesday from requiring tens of thousands of immigrants to recertify their driver's licenses and verify whether they continue to live in the state.\par \par \uc2 Martinez last month announced the residency verification plan, which represents the administration's latest effort to focus attention on the state's politically charged license policy, which the governor contends poses a security risk.\par \par \uc2 New Mexico is one of three states -- the others are Washington and Utah -- where an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  can get a driver's license because no proof of citizenship is required.\par \par \uc2 Under the residency verification plan, New Mexico sent notices to people that they must schedule an in-person appointment and bring documents, such as a utility bill or lease agreement, to prove they live in the state. The administration plans to cancel licenses of people who no longer are New Mexico residents.\par \par \uc2 Martinez wants the Legislature to repeal New Mexico's license policy by requiring people to have a Social Security number, which is not available to someone living in the country illegally, to obtain a driver's license. The governor's proposal failed in the Legislature earlier this year but she's renewing her push when lawmakers return to work next week in a special session.\par \par \uc2 District Court Judge Sarah Singleton on Wednesday issued an order temporarily halting the license residency verification program while it's being challenged in court.\par \par \uc2 A lawsuit was filed last week by the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund against the administration's plan to check a random sample of 10,000 license holders who are foreign nationals.\par \par \uc2 The lawsuit contends that the license certification program is illegal because it discriminates against one segment of the population -- foreign nationals. The suit also contends the governor doesn't have the power, without approval from the Legislature, to in effect require certain people to reapply for a driver's license.\par \par \uc2 David Urias, an Albuquerque lawyer helping to handle the case, said the judge's ruling was important "because it protects the rights of the people who are being ordered by the MVD to come before it and prove their identity and residency, even though the MVD has absolutely no reason to believe that any of these particular individuals did anything wrong."\par \par \uc2 Scott Darnell, a spokesman for the governor, said the judge's order was "fairly standard as the court examines the residency certification program."\par \par \uc2 "In the absence of the Legislature acting to put an end to the program that provides driver's licenses to illegal immigrants, the governor has the responsibility to identify and attempt to curb the dangerous fraud and identity theft that is inherent in it," Darnell said in a statement.\par \par \uc2 Wednesday was the last day of regularly scheduled appointments for residency certification. Any future appointments, according to the administration, would have been for people who had not yet complied or when the state lacked a forwarding address after the initial notice couldn't be delivered.\par \par \uc2 Of the 10,000 letters sent out, more than 30 percent have been returned as undeliverable for some reason.\par \par \uc2 The lawsuit was brought on behalf of several Democratic lawmakers and a Hispanic woman -- a foreign national from Mexico who has been living legally in the state for more than a decade.\par \par \uc2 Marcela Diaz of Somos Un Pueblo Unido, an immigrant rights group, said in a statement that the license verification program "is nothing more than a bullying tactic that intimidates and threatens people for no reason."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Follow Barry Massey on Twitter at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://twitter.com/bmasseyAP"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://twitter.com/bmasseyAP}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110831e78v002o5\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) - The state Senate on Wednesday approved the second half of contentious legislation that would allow students who are illegal immigrants to apply for state-funded scholarships and financial aid.\par \par \uc2 The Senate approved AB131, also known as the California Dream Act, with a 22-11 vote, leaving it just one step away from the governor's desk.\par \par \uc2 The state Assembly must consider changes to the bill it previously passed before it can go to Gov. Jerry Brown.\par \par \uc2 "These students are valedictorians, they're class presidents, and they're all-star athletes. They are the future of California," said Sen. Ron Calderon, D-Monterey Park, who carried the bill in the Senate.\par \par \uc2 The bill is part of a legislative package by Assemblyman Gil Cedillo, D-Los Angeles. Last month, Brown, a Democrat, signed a separate bill by Cedillo approving private scholarships and loans for \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students. AB131 would make those students eligible for state-funded financial aid.\par \par \uc2 Critics say allowing access to those state resources encourages illegal immigration. Supporters counter that the students, many of whom were brought to the United States as young children, shouldn't be punished for their parents' actions.\par \par \uc2 Sen. Doug La Malfa, R-Willows, opposed the bill Wednesday. He read a letter from a constituent who said his daughter's California education grant was recently cut. He said passing a law such as this would be like rubbing salt in his wound.\par \par \uc2 Cedillo's legislative package differs from the federal Dream Act, a proposal that would create a path to citizenship for those who are brought to the country illegally as children.\par \par \uc2 Under the bill approved Wednesday, \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students would have to meet the same requirements as others but only would qualify for financial aid that remains after legal residents apply.\par \par \uc2 "They basically receive the leftovers," Calderon said.\par \par \uc2 The state Assembly approved a similar bill Wednesday by Assemblyman Ricardo Lara, D-Bell Gardens, on a 49-23 vote and sent it to the governor's desk.\par \par \uc2 The approval came after a heated debate on AB844, which would allow \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  college students to hold student government office and receive any grants, scholarships or other assistance that come with the jobs.\par \par \uc2 Assemblyman Allan Mansoor, R-Costa Mesa, called the bill just one more attempt by Democrats to undermine immigration laws.\par \par \uc2 "It's a slap in the face to people who followed the rules, people like my parents," Mansoor said.\par \par \uc2 Lara's legislation was sparked by the story of Pedro Ramirez, the former student body president at California State University, Fresno, who acknowledged last year while in office that he was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . Ramirez had declined the $9,000 stipend to which he was entitled because he did not want to lie on employment papers.\par \par \uc2 Ramirez said his parents brought him to the U.S. when he was 3 and he only learned he was not a citizen when he began applying to colleges.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writers Sheila V.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 BOSTON (AP) - President Barack Obama's uncle, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  charged with drunken driving last week, was ordered by an immigration judge to leave the country almost two decades ago, a federal official said Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 The official said a deportation order was issued against Onyango Obama in 1992. The official spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to release details on the case.\par \par \uc2 Obama, who's from Kenya, is the half-brother of the president's late father. He has pleaded not guilty to operating under the influence of alcohol and is being held on an immigration detainer.\par \par \uc2 An immigration detainer, used by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to identify people in jail or prison who could be deported, is a request to another law enforcement agency to notify ICE before releasing the person from custody so ICE can arrange to take over custody.\par \par \uc2 Obama's immigration attorney, Margaret Wong, of Cleveland, declined to comment on his case or on how long he has been living in the U.S. illegally.\par \par \uc2 The White House also has declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 Obama, 67, was arrested last week in Framingham, where he has lived for years, about 20 miles west of Boston. He had made a rolling stop at a stop sign and nearly caused a police cruiser to strike his sport utility vehicle, police said. After being booked at a police station, he was asked whether he wanted to make a telephone call to arrange for bail, they said.\par \par \uc2 "I think I will call the White House," he said, according to a report written by Framingham police.\par \par \uc2 He is the second Obama family member to be discovered living illegally in the United States. His sister Zeituni Onyango, the president's aunt, made headlines last year when she won the right to stay in the United States after an earlier deportation order.\par \par \uc2 Onyango, of Boston, came to the United States from Kenya in 2000 and was denied asylum by an immigration judge in 2004. She stayed in the country illegally and was granted asylum last year by a judge who found she could be a target in Kenya for those who oppose the United States and the president and for members of the Kenyan government.\par \par \uc2 Obama's traffic arrest has enflamed the debate over illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 "It demonstrates what a mockery our immigration law has become," said Ira Mehlman, a spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, a national group that calls for stricter immigration laws. "Once immigrants get here, they can beat the system, they can ignore deportation orders. They can drag things out endlessly on appeal."\par \par \uc2 Obama has held a Massachusetts driver's license since at least 1992, according to the earliest electronic records kept by the state Registry of Motor Vehicles, spokesman Richard Nangle said.\par \par \uc2 "He had a Social Security number and proof of residence," Nangle said. "He did everything he needed to do by us."\par \par \uc2 Before Obama's arrest last week, he had a clear driving record, Nangle said.\par \par \uc2 The Social Security Administration did not respond to a telephone call seeking comment on Obama's case Wednesday. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 The Executive Office for Immigration Review, which oversees immigration courts, couldn't release details of Obama's case without having a signed privacy waiver from him or his attorney, spokeswoman Lauren Alder Reid said.\par \par \uc2 Boston immigration lawyer Anthony Drago said he didn't know the circumstances of Obama's case, but he said if Obama had applied for asylum he would've been eligible to apply for work authorization. If he then became legally authorized to work in the United States, Drago said, he would be eligible for a Social Security number.\par \par \uc2 Drago said some immigrants ignore deportation orders. But he said some feel they have no choice but to remain in the United States.\par \par \uc2 "Other people are just so petrified of leaving the United States and returning to a country where they feel their life is going to be in danger -- I wouldn't call that ignoring it," Drago said. "I would call that just not being able to leave."\par \par \uc2 The president, in his memoir "Dreams from My Father," refers to an Uncle Omar, who matches Obama's background and has the same date of birth.\par \par \uc2 The book is about the president retracing his roots and his 1988 trip to Kenya. In it, the president mentions photographs of his Uncle Omar, "the uncle who had left for America twenty-five years ago and had never come back." He also discusses a Kenyan expression about getting lost, meaning to not see someone in a while or to move away and stop communicating -- "like our Uncle Omar, in Boston."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110831e78v0026n\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

LOZANO   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 514 \uc2 words\par \uc2 31 August 2011\par 17:50\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2011.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 HOUSTON (AP) - A federal jury on Wednesday began deliberating the fate of a Department of Homeland Security pilot who is accused by prosecutors of lying about whether he flew his helicopter low over two would-be illegal immigrants in the Rio Grande in South Texas before one of the men drowned.\par \par \uc2 During closing arguments, prosecutors told jurors that surveillance video clearly shows James Peters flew his helicopter over the immigrants, getting as close as 100 feet to an international bridge in Laredo, in an attempt to drive them back to Mexico as they tried crossing into the United States on Dec. 14, 2005.\par \par \uc2 "Peters decides to try to push them back, force them back," said prosecutor Joseph Magliolo. "He takes progressively more aggressive action to the folks in the water."\par \par \uc2 Officials say turbulence from the helicopter's rotor blades made Carlos Delgadillo Martinez lose his grip on an inner tube. His body was found later that day.\par \par \uc2 Jurors deliberated for about five hours Wednesday. The jury was to resume its deliberations Thursday.\par \par \uc2 Peters was indicted on four counts of making false statements to investigators looking into the drowning death. He faces up to five years in prison if convicted. His trial began Monday afternoon with testimony in the case lasting just over a day.\par \par \uc2 But lawyers for Peters, 41, told jurors that prosecutors presented flimsy evidence and that the video doesn't clearly show how far above the men the helicopter actually flew.\par \par \uc2 Thomas Berg, one of Peters' attorneys, told jurors that the pilot didn't lie to investigators when asked if he encountered illegal immigrants that day and whether he flew close to the bridge. Berg said Peters believed he did not fly too close to the bridge and didn't recall flying over any individuals in the river that day.\par \par \uc2 "The dangerous work (pilots like Peters) do in trying to secure our border is to protect you," Berg told jurors. "He was doing his job that day."\par \par \uc2 Berg also said there's no proof of anyone drowning on the video.\par \par \uc2 "This is not a case about killing somebody in a river," he said. "You don't see anybody die in this video. You don't know how that man drowned."\par \par \uc2 Berg said a Border Patrol agent testified that after the helicopter left, he saw two men get out of the water on the Mexican side of the river. Magliolo acknowledged in his closing statements that the Border Patrol agent said this and that from the video it can be hard to tell whether the inner tube that Delgadillo was holding flipped over. It's unclear if the individuals whom the agent saw getting out of the river were the same ones encountered by the helicopter.\par \par \uc2 But "Peters had contact with the (illegal immigrants) at the bridge. The video shows that," Magliolo said.\par \par \uc2 Peters, who is currently stationed in Maine, has worked for Homeland Security since 1997, becoming a helicopter pilot in 2003.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110831e78v001ly\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 HOUSTON (AP) - A Department of Homeland Security pilot lied about using his helicopter in 2005 to force two would-be illegal immigrants back into Mexico as they attempted to cross the Rio Grande on inner tubes, an action that resulted in the drowning of one of the individuals, a federal prosecutor told jurors on Monday.\par \par \uc2 James Peters faces four counts of making false statements to investigators looking into the death of Carlos Delgadillo Martinez, a Mexican national.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors told jurors during opening statements in Peters' trial that the 41-year-old lied about taking part in a Dec. 14, 2005 incident near a bridge in Laredo, Texas. They accuse Peters of flying his helicopter low over the Rio Grande in an attempt to force Delgadillo and another person, who authorities say were trying to illegally cross into the U.S., back to Mexico.\par \par \uc2 "He flew over them, hovered over them," said prosecutor Ruben Perez.\par \par \uc2 Investigators say the force of the turbulence from the low flying helicopter's rotor made Delgadillo lose his grip on an inner tube. His body was found later that day near the bridge.\par \par \uc2 Perez said a video from a Border Patrol pole camera will show that Peters' helicopter flew below the bridge and hovered over the water on the day of the drowning.\par \par \uc2 According to the indictment, internal radio transmissions indicate Peters told a Border Patrol agent he was going to try to make the individuals "go back."\par \par \uc2 "He lied and we are going to prove that to you," Perez said.\par \par \uc2 But Thomas Berg, Peters' attorney, told jurors his client didn't lie to investigators but that they misunderstood him when he was initially questioned about the incident a month after it happened. Berg said Peters had to go back and review records about whether he had flown near the bridge on that day.\par \par \uc2 Berg said that on the day of the drowning, Peters responded to a call from Border Patrol agents who were dealing with smugglers near the bridge in Laredo.\par \par \uc2 "It appeared people were in the water. What happened to them after that, (Peters) doesn't know because he left," Berg said.\par \par \uc2 Berg said Peters' helicopter is designed to fly low to the ground but that the aircraft was never closer than 100 feet to the bridge on the day of the drowning.\par \par \uc2 Berg said responding to such calls was routine for Peters.\par \par \uc2 "Why would he be lying about an incident if there was nothing significant about it?" he said.\par \par \uc2 Peters, who was indicted in January, has pleaded not guilty and faces up to five years in prison if convicted.\par \par \uc2 Peters, who is currently stationed in Maine, has worked for Homeland Security since 1997, becoming a helicopter pilot in 2003.\par \par \uc2 The trial was expected to last several days.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110830e78u000bp\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

(AP) -- A jury recommended Monday that a Kansas man be sentenced to death for killing four family members in November 2009.\par \par \uc2 The jury returned its recommendation after hearing more testimony about 48-year-old James Kraig Kahler and his state of mind at the time of the fatal shootings. The judge -- who is not bound the recommendation -- set sentencing for Oct. 11 in Osage County District Court.\par \par \uc2 Kahler was convicted Thursday of four counts of capital murder in the killings of 44-year-old Karen Kahler; her grandmother, Dorothy Wight, 89; and the Kahlers' daughters, Emily, 18, and Lauren, 16. The Kahlers' son, Sean, now 12, was not threatened during the rampage and testified at trial that he saw his father shoot his mother.\par \par \uc2 The victims' family members read a short statement outside the courthouse after the verdict, saying all relatives "still have a lot of healing to do" and that the trial didn't restore their relatives' lives.\par \par \uc2 "For the past year and a half, we've had a dark cloud around us that we associated with this trial," said Lynn Denton, Karen Kahler's sister. "Now that it's over, the cloud is still there.\par \par \uc2 "The cloud wasn't about the trial, it is about our loss."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Grocery owner pleads guilty to food stamp scheme\par \par \uc2 WICHITA, Kan. (AP) -- A Wichita grocery store owner admitted Monday to conspiring to trade cash for his customers' food stamps at a profit and giving a cut to a man who scoured homeless shelters for people willing to sell their government benefits.\par \par \uc2 Ahmed Ajami Al-Maleki, the owner of Kansas Food Market, repeatedly answered "I am guilty" to charges of conspiracy, wire fraud and food stamp fraud.\par \par \uc2 U.S. District Judge J. Thomas Marten set sentencing for Nov. 21. He faces up to 20 years in prison, although he is likely to get far less, if any, prison time under federal sentencing guidelines. He also faces potential fines and likely restitution.\par \par \uc2 "Abuse of important federal programs such as food stamps will not be tolerated," U.S. Attorney Barry Grissom said in a news release. "There are those who need access to these programs, and when a handful of people steal from them, it hurts those in need and it hurts all of us."\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors indicted Al-Maleki, 41, for fraudulently making $130,000 in some 750 transactions involving at least 100 food stamp recipients.\par \par \uc2 In a deal for his guilty plea, the government agreed to dismiss other counts in the food stamp case as well as a separate indictment accusing him of knowingly hiring an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . Prosecutors agreed to recommend a sentence at the low end of federal sentencing guidelines.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Hoenig addresses Kan. officials on economy\par \par \uc2 TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) -- The president of the Federal Reserve bank in Kansas City, Mo., said Monday the United States must make significant reforms, including reviving the manufacturing sector, in order to restore confidence in the economy.\par \par \uc2 Thomas H. Hoenig made his remarks to members of Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback's administration, bankers and legislators in Topeka.\par \par \uc2 Hoenig said decades of lost manufacturing jobs, rising debt and long-term obligations have put the nation's economy and future at risk. He said the United States needs to create a climate to promote manufacturing more goods that the world demands.\par \par \uc2 "You don't create jobs, you create an environment to create jobs," Hoenig said.\par \par \uc2 He said the United States had become too dependent on consumer spending to drive growth, but that has slowed as consumer debt increases and savings rates decline to near zero, eliminating any ability to invest capital.\par \par \uc2 Hoenig said Washington policies would not revive the economy alone, such as providing short-term stimulus packages or adjusting monetary policies with increased regulations.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 2011 Indian Peace Treaty pageant might be last\par \par \uc2 MEDICINE LODGE, Kan. (AP) -- A September tradition in southern Kansas that celebrates 300 years of the state's history might become history itself after this year's event because of a lack of money and volunteers, organizers said.\par \par \uc2 The Medicine Lodge Indian Peace Treaty Pageant has drawn thousands of people to the south central town where the pageant has been held every three to five years since it began in 1927.\par \par \uc2 But it requires help from nearly all the town's 2,300 residents and interest in participating has dropped in recent years, The Wichita Eagle reported ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://bit.ly/n09Mgphttp://bit.ly/n09Mgp"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://bit.ly/n09Mgphttp://bit.ly/n09Mgp}}}\uc2  ) Monday.\par \par \uc2 The pageant, held in a natural amphitheater, typically draws between 10,000 and 15,000 visitors from Kansas and across the nation. This year's will be the 23rd pageant.\par \par \uc2 The focus is a re-enactment of the signing of an 1867 treaty that was supposed to make traveling safer for those heading to frontier settlements in the West. It also one of the largest gatherings of Plains Indians -- 15,000 Kiowa, Comanche, Arapaho, Apache and Cheyenne.\par \par \uc2 "It is with great sadness that possibly this will be our last one," wrote Robert Larson, one of the pageant's board members, in an email to The Eagle. "It has become difficult to get community support and financial assistance to continue this wonderful event, as you probably know once you lose something like this it is almost impossible for a small community to get it back."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Kan. crops continue decline amid heat, dry weather\par \par \uc2 WICHITA, Kan. (AP) -- A new report says the condition of Kansas farm crops declined slightly over the past week amid heat and dry weather.\par \par \uc2 Kansas Agricultural Statistics Service, in its report Monday, says about 8 percent of the state's corn crop has now been harvested. The agency says 46 percent of the corn is rated in poor to very poor condition, with 27 percent rated fair, 22 percent good and 5 percent in excellent condition.\par \par \uc2 Forty-four percent of the sorghum crop and 42 percent of the soybean crop were rated in poor to very poor condition.\par \par \uc2 Hay and forage supplies were running about 53 percent short to very short statewide. Concern is also growing for stock ponds as water levels continue to fall.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Kansas worker dies in railroad accident\par \par \uc2 ABILENE, Kan.

Railroad spokesman Mark Davis says crossing arms are supposed to come down across streets when the trucks are on the tracks. He says he doesn't know why the arms didn't go down.\par \par \uc2 A woman driving the car was hospitalized by the patrol says her injuries weren't serious.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 1 rescued after Fort Leavenworth wall collapse\par \par \uc2 FORT LEAVENWORTH, Kan. (AP) -- One person has been rescued after spending more than an hour trapped underneath a collapsed wall at Fort Leavenworth in northeast Kansas.\par \par \uc2 Fort Leavenworth spokeswoman Rebecca Steed says the contractor was air evacuated for treatment after he was rescued Monday morning from a building that was being renovated. The name of the contractor wasn't immediately released.\par \par \uc2 The construction company has accounted for all the other people working in the building.\par \par \uc2 It's unclear what caused the wall to collapse.\par \par \uc2 Steed says the building was inside the walls of the old military prison at Fort Leavenworth. Since the old prison has been torn down, some of the older buildings that surrounded it are being renovated. They hold everything from offices to a restaurant.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110830e78u0014l\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) - A federal judge temporarily blocked enforcement of Alabama's new law cracking down on illegal immigration, ruling Monday that she needed more time to decide whether the law opposed by the Obama administration, church leaders and immigrant-rights groups is constitutional.\par \par \uc2 The brief order by U.S. District Judge Sharon L. Blackburn means the law -- which opponents and supporters alike have called the toughest in the nation -- won't take effect as scheduled on Thursday. The ruling was cheered both by Republican leaders who were pleased the judge didn't gut the law and by opponents who compare it to old Jim Crow-era statutes against racial integration.\par \par \uc2 Blackburn didn't address whether the law is constitutional, and she could still let all or parts of the law take effect later. Instead, she said she needed more time to consider lawsuits filed by the Justice Department, private groups and individuals that claim the state is overstepping its bounds.\par \par \uc2 The judge said she will issue a longer ruling by Sept. 28, and her temporary order will remain in effect until the day after. She heard arguments from the Justice Department and others during a daylong hearing last week.\par \par \uc2 Similar laws have been passed in Arizona, Utah, Indiana and Georgia. Federal judges already have blocked all or parts of the laws in those states.\par \par \uc2 Among other things, the law would require schools to verify the citizenship status of students, but it wouldn't prevent illegal immigrants from attending public schools.\par \par \uc2 The law also would make it a crime to knowingly assist an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  by providing them a ride, a job, a place to live or most anything else -- a section that church leaders fear would hamper public assistance ministries. It also would allow police to jail suspected illegal immigrants during traffic stops.\par \par \uc2 Finding a way to curtail public spending that benefits illegal immigrants has been a pet project of Alabama conservatives for years. Census figures released earlier this year show the state's Hispanic population more than doubled over a decade to 185,602 last year, and supporters of the law contend many of them are in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 Isabel Rubio, executive director of the Hispanic Interest Coalition of Alabama, which is among the groups that sued over the law, hopes Blackburn will block it entirely but was happy with the temporary reprieve.\par \par \uc2 "We are pleased that Judge Blackburn is taking more time to study the case," she said.\par \par \uc2 Republican Gov. Robert Bentley said he would continue to defend the law, and GOP leaders in the House and Senate praised Blackburn -- a Republican appointee -- for taking time to fully consider the law.\par \par \uc2 "We must remember that today's ruling is simply the first round in what promises to be a long judicial fight over Alabama's right to protect its borders," said House Majority Leader Micky Hammon of Decatur. "To put it in sports terms, it is the first half-inning of the first game of a seven-game World Series."\par \par \uc2 While the Obama administration contends the state law conflicts with federal immigration law, state Sen. Scott Beason, R-Gardendale, contends the federal government isn't doing its job enforcing immigration laws. Beason said that he spent years researching immigration law to help write the 70-plus page law, and that it's unrealistic to expect a judge to go through it all in a few days.\par \par \uc2 "You just can't do that," he said.\par \par \uc2 5\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110829e78t0021j\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WICHITA, Kan. (AP) - A Wichita grocery store owner admitted Monday to conspiring to trade cash for his customers' food stamps at a profit and giving a cut to a man who scoured homeless shelters for people willing to sell their government benefits.\par \par \uc2 Ahmed Ajami Al-Maleki, the owner of Kansas Food Market, repeatedly answered "I am guilty" to charges of conspiracy, wire fraud and food stamp fraud.\par \par \uc2 U.S. District Judge J. Thomas Marten set sentencing for Nov. 21. He faces up to 20 years in prison, although he is likely to get far less, if any, prison time under federal sentencing guidelines. He also faces potential fines and likely restitution.\par \par \uc2 "Abuse of important federal programs such as food stamps will not be tolerated," U.S. Attorney Barry Grissom said in a news release. "There are those who need access to these programs, and when a handful of people steal from them, it hurts those in need and it hurts all of us."\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors indicted Al-Maleki, 41, for fraudulently making $130,000 in some 750 transactions involving at least 100 food stamp recipients.\par \par \uc2 In a deal for his guilty plea, the government agreed to dismiss other counts in the food stamp case as well as a separate indictment accusing him of knowingly hiring an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . Prosecutors agreed to recommend a sentence at the low end of federal sentencing guidelines.\par \par \uc2 Al-Maleki admitted in his plea agreement that between July and December of last year, he intentionally entered into an agreement with Wally Mikhael Gaggo and others to defraud the Department of Agriculture by giving cash to recipients of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, commonly known as food stamps.\par \par \uc2 Indictments filed in March accuse 13 people in a scheme that defrauded the government out of more than $580,000. The two food stamp-related indictments came after months of investigations involving undercover informants, surveillance of the stores and computerized detection systems. Most have pleaded guilty.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors said the two small stores -- the Kansas Food Market and the Alnoor Grocery and Biryani House -- typically paid people half of the value of their benefits and pocketed the difference. Gaggo, the runner who was charged in both indictments, has pleaded guilty and faces sentencing Oct. 17.\par \par \uc2 The owners of Alnoor Grocery and Biryani House face trial in October.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110829e78t0016h\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 HOUSTON (AP) - A Department of Homeland Security pilot lied about using his helicopter in 2005 to force two would-be illegal immigrants back into Mexico as they attempted to cross the Rio Grande on inner tubes, an action that resulted in the drowning of one of the individuals, a federal prosecutor told jurors on Monday.\par \par \uc2 James Peters faces four counts of making false statements to investigators looking into the death of Carlos Delgadillo Martinez, a Mexican national.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors told jurors during opening statements in Peters' trial that the 41-year-old lied about taking part in a Dec. 14, 2005 incident near a bridge in Laredo, Texas. They accuse Peters of flying his helicopter low over the Rio Grande in an attempt to force Delgadillo and another person, who authorities say were trying to illegally cross into the U.S., back to Mexico.\par \par \uc2 "He flew over them, hovered over them," said prosecutor Ruben Perez.\par \par \uc2 Investigators say the force of the turbulence from the low flying helicopter's rotor made Delgadillo lose his grip on an inner tube. His body was found later that day near the bridge.\par \par \uc2 Perez said a video from a Border Patrol pole camera will show that Peters' helicopter flew below the bridge and hovered over the water on the day of the drowning.\par \par \uc2 According to the indictment, internal radio transmissions indicate Peters told a Border Patrol agent he was going to try to make the individuals "go back."\par \par \uc2 "He lied and we are going to prove that to you," Perez said.\par \par \uc2 But Thomas Berg, Peters' attorney, told jurors his client didn't lie to investigators but that they misunderstood him when he was initially questioned about the incident a month after it happened. Berg said Peters had to go back and review records about whether he had flown near the bridge on that day.\par \par \uc2 Berg said that on the day of the drowning, Peters responded to a call from Border Patrol agents who were dealing with smugglers near the bridge in Laredo.\par \par \uc2 "It appeared people were in the water. What happened to them after that, (Peters) doesn't know because he left," Berg said.\par \par \uc2 Berg said Peters' helicopter is designed to fly low to the ground but that the aircraft was never closer than 100 feet to the bridge on the day of the drowning.\par \par \uc2 Berg said responding to such calls was routine for Peters.\par \par \uc2 "Why would he be lying about an incident if there was nothing significant about it?" he said.\par \par \uc2 Peters, who was indicted in January, has pleaded not guilty and faces up to five years in prison if convicted.\par \par \uc2 Peters, who is currently stationed in Maine, has worked for Homeland Security since 1997, becoming a helicopter pilot in 2003.\par \par \uc2 The trial was expected to last several days.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110829e78t00137\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ATHENS, Ga. (AP) - As college students return to campus in Georgia, a new state policy has closed the doors of the five most competitive state schools to illegal immigrants, but a group of professors has found a way to offer those students a taste of what they've been denied.\par \par \uc2 The five University of Georgia professors have started a program they're calling Freedom University. They're offering to teach a rigorous seminar course once a week meant to mirror courses taught at the most competitive schools and aimed at students who have graduated from high school but can't go to one of those top schools because of the new policy or because of cuts to state scholarship programs.\par \par \uc2 "This is not a substitute for letting these students into UGA, Georgia State or the other schools," said Pam Voekel, a history professor at UGA and one of the program's initiators. "It is designed for people who, right now, don't have another option."\par \par \uc2 The policy, adopted last fall by the university system's Board of Regents, bars any state college or university that has rejected academically qualified applicants in the previous two years from admitting illegal immigrants. That includes five Georgia colleges and universities: the University of Georgia, Georgia Tech, Georgia State University, Georgia Health Sciences University and Georgia College & State University. Illegal immigrants may still be admitted to any other state college or university, provided that they pay out-of-state tuition.\par \par \uc2 The new rule came in response to public concerns that Georgia state colleges and universities were being overrun by illegal immigrants, that taxpayers were subsidizing their education and legal residents were being displaced. A study conducted by the university system's Board of Regents last year found that less than 1 percent of the state's public college students were illegal immigrants, and that students who pay out-of-state tuition more than pay for their education.\par \par \uc2 "What we're hoping is that people in decision-making positions will reconsider the policy," said Reinaldo Roman, another of the organizing professors. "It goes counter to our aims. We have invested enormous resources in these young people. It makes sense to give them a chance at an education."\par \par \uc2 For now the course will simply serve to expose the students to a college environment and challenge them intellectually. It will not likely count for credit should the students be accepted at another school, but the professors said they're seeking accreditation so credits would be transferable at some point in the future.\par \par \uc2 The five founding professors all work for UGA, but they stress that the program has no connection to the institution. UGA referred a request for comment to the Board of Regents. Regents spokesman John Millsaps said faculty members are generally free to do whatever they want with their free time as long as it doesn't interfere with their responsibilities as employees of the university system. But he said he didn't know about enough about the program to comment on this specific case.\par \par \uc2 Once the professors hatched their plan -- which was suggested by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  community member who works with a lot of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  teens -- they reached out to professors at prestigious schools nationwide to sit on a national board of advisers. One of them is Pulitzer Prize winning author and MIT professor Junot Diaz, who calls policies barring illegal immigrants from state schools cruel and divisive. He said he's ready to help Freedom University succeed.\par \par \uc2 "Whatever they ask of me. I'll do everything and anything I can," he wrote in an email. "This clearly is going to be a long fight."\par \par \uc2 With professors donating their time and a local Latino community outreach center offering a space for free, the program has few costs. They've started an \uc2 Amazon.com\uc2  wish list asking people to donate textbooks for students and gas cards for volunteers who will drive students to and from class.\par \par \uc2 Dressed in a black fleece jacket and tan cargo shorts and carrying a black backpack during a protest rally Tuesday at UGA against the policy, 25-year-old Karl Kings looked like he could be headed to class. However, Kings says he's an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who was brought to the U.S. when he was a year old from a country in Asia that he declined to identify.\par \par \uc2 "Pretty much, I would be a Georgia boy except I wasn't born here," he said. "I grew up here my whole life."\par \par \uc2 After graduating from high school in suburban Atlanta in 2004, he dreamed of going to college but couldn't afford to pay out-of-state tuition. He's gotten by doing odd jobs, but has had to turn down some more stable or challenging job offers because they required proof of eligibility to work in the U.S. He was filling out an application for Freedom University at the end of the rally this week.\par \par \uc2 The program is currently taking applications, with the first class, American Civilization I, set to start Sept. 8. The five professors will rotate teaching the seminar course on their own time at an off-campus location. All qualified applicants will likely be accepted unless there are so many applications that space constraints force them to limit admissions, said Lorgia Garcia Pena, another of the founding professors.\par \par \uc2 Leeidy Solis,16, was brought to the U.S. illegally by her parents from Mexico when she was 2. A high school senior in Athens, she wants to become a veterinarian. She finds it hard to listen to her friends discuss where they're applying to college because she's not sure she will be able to go. She's looking into where she might get a grant or scholarship to pay for her education.\par \par \uc2 Her parents are thinking of packing up and heading back to Mexico. They are encouraging her to apply to college there and go with them. But she doesn't remember Mexico and all her friends and cultural experiences are here, so she wants to stay. She said she's definitely keeping Freedom University in mind.\par \par \uc2 "Even if they don't count it as a credit, at least we as students can experience what it's like to take a real college class," she said\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110826e78q00032\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) - Law enforcement officers around Alabama are still uncertain what will be required of them if a federal judge allows a tough new immigration law to take effect next week.\par \par \uc2 The president of the Alabama Association of Chiefs of Police, Boaz Police Chief Terry Davis, said he's trying to understand what the law requires, but he's not giving any special advice to chiefs yet.\par \par \uc2 The executive director of the Alabama Sheriff's Association, Bobby Timmons, said he plans to conduct a school for sheriffs and deputies on what the law requires.\par \par \uc2 The law has been described by opponents and supporters as the toughest in the country. It is scheduled to take effect Sept. 1, but U.S. District Judge Sharon Blackburn in Birmingham has not ruled on lawsuits seeking to block all or parts of it.\par \par \uc2 Davis said he doesn't plan to make a lot of changes in how his police officers operate. He said if officers stop someone who is in the country illegally they would follow the law, but they "will not stop people just because they are Hispanic."\par \par \uc2 The law allows police to detain someone after a routine traffic stop if they suspect the person to be in the country illegally. The law also makes it a crime to knowingly provide transportation or shelter to an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "We're just going to do our job. We're not going to go out and stop people just because they're Hispanic," Davis said. "I don't think being Hispanic is illegal."\par \par \uc2 Timmons said the law specifically prohibits law enforcement officers from profiling and he said he has passed on that message to sheriffs.\par \par \uc2 "We've told them absolutely no profiling," Timmons said.\par \par \uc2 Unless it is blocked by the federal judge, Timmons said he has told sheriffs to "enforce the law just like it's written" when it takes effect on Sept. 1. He said he was working with Madison County Sheriff Blake Dorning, president of the sheriff's association, to set up the training. He said he would go over specifics of the law with sheriffs after Blackburn releases her ruling and make sure they understand what's still in it and what, if anything, the judge has blocked.\par \par \uc2 A spokeswoman for the Alabama attorney general's office, Suzanne Webb, said officials in the office were working with state agencies to make sure they were ready to implement the new law when it takes effect.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110825e78p00250\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ATHENS, Ga. (AP) - As college students return to campus in Georgia, a new state policy has closed the doors of the five most competitive state schools to illegal immigrants, but a group of professors has found a way to offer those students a taste of what they've been denied.\par \par \uc2 The five University of Georgia professors have started a program they're calling Freedom University. They're offering to teach a rigorous seminar course once a week meant to mirror courses taught at the most competitive schools and aimed at students who have graduated from high school but can't go to one of those top schools because of the new policy or because of cuts to state scholarship programs.\par \par \uc2 "This is not a substitute for letting these students into UGA, Georgia State or the other schools," said Pam Voekel, a history professor at UGA and one of the program's initiators. "It is designed for people who, right now, don't have another option."\par \par \uc2 The policy, adopted last fall by the university system's Board of Regents, bars any state college or university that has rejected academically qualified applicants in the previous two years from admitting illegal immigrants. That includes five Georgia colleges and universities: the University of Georgia, Georgia Tech, Georgia State University, Medical College of Georgia and Georgia College & State University. Illegal immigrants may still be admitted to any other state college or university, provided that they pay out-of-state tuition.\par \par \uc2 The new rule came in response to public concerns that Georgia state colleges and universities were being overrun by illegal immigrants, that taxpayers were subsidizing their education and legal residents were being displaced. A study conducted by the university system's Board of Regents last year found that less than 1 percent of the state's public college students were illegal immigrants, and that students who pay out-of-state tuition more than pay for their education.\par \par \uc2 "What we're hoping is that people in decision-making positions will reconsider the policy," said Reinaldo Roman, another of the organizing professors. "It goes counter to our aims. We have invested enormous resources in these young people. It makes sense to give them a chance at an education."\par \par \uc2 For now the course will simply serve to expose the students to a college environment and challenge them intellectually. It will not likely count for credit should the students be accepted at another school, but the professors said they're seeking accreditation so credits would be transferable at some point in the future.\par \par \uc2 The five founding professors all work for UGA, but they stress that the program has no connection to the institution. UGA referred a request for comment to the Board of Regents. Regents spokesman John Millsaps said faculty members are generally free to do whatever they want with their free time as long as it doesn't interfere with their responsibilities as employees of the university system. But he said he didn't know about enough about the program to comment on this specific case.\par \par \uc2 Once the professors hatched their plan -- which was suggested by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  community member who works with a lot of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  teens -- they reached out to professors at prestigious schools nationwide to sit on a national board of advisers. One of them is Pulitzer Prize winning author and MIT professor Junot Diaz, who calls policies barring illegal immigrants from state schools cruel and divisive. He said he's ready to help Freedom University succeed.\par \par \uc2 "Whatever they ask of me. I'll do everything and anything I can," he wrote in an email. "This clearly is going to be a long fight."\par \par \uc2 With professors donating their time and a local Latino community outreach center offering a space for free, the program has few costs. They've started an \uc2 Amazon.com\uc2  wish list asking people to donate textbooks for students and gas cards for volunteers who will drive students to and from class.\par \par \uc2 Dressed in a black fleece jacket and tan cargo shorts and carrying a black backpack during a protest rally Tuesday at UGA against the policy, 25-year-old Karl Kings looked like he could be headed to class. However, Kings says he's an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who was brought to the U.S. when he was a year old from a country in Asia that he declined to identify.\par \par \uc2 "Pretty much, I would be a Georgia boy except I wasn't born here," he said. "I grew up here my whole life."\par \par \uc2 After graduating from high school in suburban Atlanta in 2004, he dreamed of going to college but couldn't afford to pay out-of-state tuition. He's gotten by doing odd jobs, but has had to turn down some more stable or challenging job offers because they required proof of eligibility to work in the U.S. He was filling out an application for Freedom University at the end of the rally this week.\par \par \uc2 The program is currently taking applications, with the first class, American Civilization I, set to start Sept. 8. The five professors will rotate teaching the seminar course on their own time at an off-campus location. All qualified applicants will likely be accepted unless there are so many applications that space constraints force them to limit admissions, said Lorgia Garcia Pena, another of the founding professors.\par \par \uc2 Leeidy Solis,16, was brought to the U.S. illegally by her parents from Mexico when she was 2. A high school senior in Athens, she wants to become a veterinarian. She finds it hard to listen to her friends discuss where they're applying to college because she's not sure she will be able to go. She's looking into where she might get a grant or scholarship to pay for her education.\par \par \uc2 Her parents are thinking of packing up and heading back to Mexico. They are encouraging her to apply to college there and go with them. But she doesn't remember Mexico and all her friends and cultural experiences are here, so she wants to stay. She said she's definitely keeping Freedom University in mind.\par \par \uc2 "Even if they don't count it as a credit, at least we as students can experience what it's like to take a real college class," she said\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110825e78p0016n\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) - Two Maryland women facing deportation pleaded with a Homeland Security official Wednesday to end a program that gives federal immigration authorities access to fingerprints of people arrested.\par \par \uc2 Speaking in Spanish, Maria Bolanos told Marc Rapp, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement acting assistant director for the Secure Communities program, that she was arrested after calling police in Maryland during a fight with her partner. She was arrested, she said, and accused of illegally selling telephone calling cards. Now she's facing deportation because her fingerprints were shared with immigration authorities and she was identified as an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  as part of the Secure Communities program.\par \par \uc2 "I'm not a criminal," Bolanos said, adding that she fears being separated from her young daughter.\par \par \uc2 Bolanos, who was joined by Florinda Lorenzo, confronted Rapp during a public hearing on the Secure Communities program, which allows immigration authorities to use fingerprints sent to the FBI to identify illegal immigrants arrested around the country.\par \par \uc2 After Bolanos and Lorenzo confronted Rapp, who did not respond, about 200 people walked out of the meeting, chanting "end it, don't amend it."\par \par \uc2 Gustavo Andrade, an organizing director for Casa Maryland, asked the panel to resign before leading the protesters out.\par \par \uc2 Similar scenes have played out at other public hearings on Secure Communities in Dallas, Los Angeles, and Chicago.\par \par \uc2 Rapp declined to comment on the confrontation.\par \par \uc2 It was the fourth public forum held by members of a Homeland Security task force asked to come up with recommendations to improve the program, which critics contend has resulted in the deportation of thousands of people arrested on minor traffic offenses or other misdemeanors. Critics have also complained that states are being forced to participate in the program, despite initial assurances that the program was optional.\par \par \uc2 Earlier this month, ICE Director John Morton announced the agency was canceling previously signed agreements with states, saying that state permission was not needed for the fingerprint-sharing program.\par \par \uc2 Gary Mead, who leads ICE's enforcement and removal operations, said immigration officials are working to focus their efforts on criminals, repeated immigration violators and immigration fugitives. He said a June memo from ICE Director John Morton outlining when and how officials could use discretion in deportation cases -- including in cases of people with no criminal history and those who were brought to the United States as children -- was proof of that effort.\par \par \uc2 Last week, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano announced in a letter to senators supporting immigration reform that each of the approximately 300,000 cases pending in federal immigration court would be reviewed on a case-by-case basis and those with no criminal record would have their cases indefinitely put on hold.\par \par \uc2 Lorenzo, who spoke to a group of supporters before Wednesday's meeting, said she was pleased to hear about the policy change, but she still worries.\par \par \uc2 "I am fighting to stay here and not be separated from my children," the mother of three said.\par \par \uc2 The task force, which does not include Homeland Security or any other federal officials, is expected to make recommendations for changes to the Secure Communities program in September.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110825e78p00063\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) - Four state legislators and a Silver City woman asked a judge Wednesday to stop Gov. Susana Martinez's administration from trying to verify whether immigrants who received a driver's license in New Mexico still live in the state.\par \par \uc2 An Albuquerque law firm and the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund filed a lawsuit in state District Court in Santa Fe on behalf of the Democratic lawmakers and the Hispanic woman.\par \par \uc2 The suit seeks to block a state agency from checking a random sample of 10,000 license holders who are foreign nationals to determine their residency.\par \par \uc2 New Mexico is one of only three states -- the others are Washington and Utah -- where an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  can get a driver's license because no proof of citizenship is required. However, Utah's permits cannot be used as government ID cards.\par \par \uc2 Martinez wants the Legislature to end New Mexico's policy of granting driver's licenses to illegal immigrants. She and other critics contend it jeopardizes public safety and attracts illegal immigrants who fraudulently claim to live in the state only to get ID cards that make it easier to stay in the country.\par \par \uc2 The Republican governor in July announced the residency verification plan -- the administration's latest effort to focus attention on the state's politically charged license policy.\par \par \uc2 Under the plan, New Mexico sent notices to people that they must schedule an in-person appointment and bring documents, such as a utility bill or lease agreement, to prove they live in the state. The administration plans to cancel licenses of people who no longer are New Mexico residents.\par \par \uc2 The lawsuit contends the governor's license certification program is illegal because it singles out foreign nationals for unfair treatment, violating equal protection provisions of the state and federal constitutions. The lawsuit said the administration also lacks the power to order the checks because the program wasn't authorized by the Legislature and it effectively requires some people to reapply for a driver's license.\par \par \uc2 "The program is unconstitutional because it unfairly targets certain Latinos in New Mexico and places a higher burden on them beyond what the law requires of other residents," said Martha Gomez, an attorney for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund.\par \par \uc2 Martinez spokesman Scott Darnell said the suit attempts to stop an effort by the state to confront identity theft and fraud.\par \par \uc2 "This out-of-state group may believe that New Mexicans do not have a right to know who is residing within their borders, and as such, they may not have a problem trying to protect the illegal immigrants who have come to New Mexico from throughout the country to get our driver's license and leave," Darnell said in a statement. "But New Mexicans have a decidedly different point of view, and so does Gov. Martinez."\par \par \uc2 Martinez, who took office in January, vowed during her gubernatorial campaign to end the state's licensing policy enacted during former Democratic Gov. Bill Richardson's administration.\par \par \uc2 The governor's license repeal proposal failed earlier this year in the Democratic-controlled Legislature. Opponents said the move to end immigrant licenses was politically motivated and targeted Mexican immigrants. Martinez plans to ask the Legislature to revisit the issue during a special session that starts next month.\par \par \uc2 Under a 2003 law, more than 80,000 driver's licenses have gone to foreign nationals. The state says it doesn't know how many of those went to illegal immigrants because it doesn't ask the immigration status of license applicants.\par \par \uc2 Democratic Rep. Miguel Garcia of Albuquerque helped bring the lawsuit and was a main sponsor of the 2003 license legislation. He said the law provides an opportunity for "our immigrant population to come out of the shadows and become a participatory member of our society."\par \par \uc2 Garcia and other supporters say the licensing law has improved public safety by having immigrants get insurance for their vehicles, and has lessened immigrant fears about reporting crimes and cooperating with police.\par \par \uc2 Also bringing the lawsuit are Rep. Eliseo Alcon, D-Milan; Sens. Howie Morales, D-Silver City, and Gerald Ortiz y Pino, D-Albuquerque; and Morales' sister-in-law Marisela Morales, a legal permanent U.S. resident who has lived in the country for 16 years.\par \par \uc2 Immigrant applicants for a New Mexico driver's license don't need a Social Security number as part of their identification. Instead, they can submit a taxpayer identification number issued by the federal government along with other identification, such as a Mexican Consulate-issued ID card known as a matricula consular.\par \par \uc2 Slightly more than 1,000 foreign national license holders have had their licenses recertified so far, according to the governor's office. About 2,500 appointments have been scheduled. Of the 10,000 letters sent out, about 31 percent have been returned as undeliverable for some reason, including that there is no forwarding address for an individual.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Follow Barry Massey on Twitter at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://twitter.com/bmasseyAP"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://twitter.com/bmasseyAP}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110825e78p0004c\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) - Lawyers for the federal government and for a coalition of civil rights groups asked a federal judge Wednesday to block a new Alabama law cracking down on illegal immigration, arguing that it stomps on such basic rights as free speech and free travel.\par \par \uc2 But attorneys for the state argued the new law allows the state to regulate illegal immigration in the absence of action from the federal government and that many opponents have overreacted about the law's expected impact.\par \par \uc2 Deputy Assistant U.S. Attorney General William Orrick told U.S. District Judge Sharon Blackburn that sections of Alabama's law -- which has been described by opponents and supporters as the toughest such law in the country -- should be blocked because they conflict with federal law.\par \par \uc2 Blackburn was holding a hearing on lawsuits filed by the U.S. government, civil rights groups including the American Civil Liberties Union and Alabama church leaders that seek to block the new law signed by Gov. Robert Bentley in June.\par \par \uc2 The daylong hearing in Birmingham ended Wednesday evening after more than 9 hours of arguments. Blackburn ended by the proceeding by saying she would not issue an immediate ruling.\par \par \uc2 The law allows police officers, in conducting routine traffic stops, to arrest those they suspect of being illegal immigrants. Other provisions in the broad measure also make it a crime to transport or provide shelter to an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . It also requires schools to report the immigration status of students, a provision opponents say will make many parents afraid to send their children to school.\par \par \uc2 Orrick said the new law intrudes on the authority of the federal government, which enforces immigration policy. Judges have blocked all or parts of similar laws in Arizona, Utah, Georgia and Indiana.\par \par \uc2 "There's no room for the states to be legislating in this area," Orrick told Blackburn, who heard three hours of arguments from the law's opponents in the morning.\par \par \uc2 Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange later told the judge that the immigration law should not be seen as a sign that Alabama doesn't welcome those from other nations.\par \par \uc2 Strange said the state's recruitment in recent years of such foreign-owned businesses as Hyundai from South Korea and Mercedes from Germany shows that "nothing is further from the truth." He urged the judge to let the law take effect as planned Sept. 1.\par \par \uc2 Strange also told Blackburn that foes have exaggerated predictions of dire effects of the new law. He said it would not prevent church leaders from ministering to illegal immigrants nor deter worship and participation in religious ceremonies that is protected under state and federal constitutions.\par \par \uc2 In asking Blackburn to thrown out parts of the law, Orrick told Blackburn it makes criminals out of people who rent houses to illegal immigrants and in some cases makes it a crime to work.\par \par \uc2 Orrick also argued that the law harms the reputation of the U.S. with other countries.\par \par \uc2 "It corrodes the reputation of the United States for American values like openness and welcoming others," Orrick said.\par \par \uc2 He also criticized a section of the law that requires schools to report the immigration status of students, saying it would make parents afraid to send their children to school.\par \par \uc2 The state's attorneys defended that provision.\par \par \uc2 "We are simply gathering data," said Assistant Attorney General Misty Fairbanks. Under Blackburn's questioning, she said the provision also is not an attempt to label immigrant children.\par \par \uc2 Republican state Sen. Scott Beason -- one of the law's sponsors -- said outside court that he didn't hear any discussion of the rights of legal Alabama residents during the arguments before the judge.\par \par \uc2 "I didn't hear the federal government or the ACLU arguing about the rights of citizens of Alabama who have been displaced from their jobs by these illegal immigrants. Who's looking out for their rights?" Beason said in an interview.\par \par \uc2 During a break in the hearing, Beason als spoke with some Hispanic young people and told them Alabama's law was not intended to hurt them.\par \par \uc2 A recent high school graduate, 19-year-old Victor Palafox, told Beason the teens were worried the law would prevent them from attending college or getting good jobs. Beason told the teenagers he respects their opinions but the law does what's best for the people of Alabama.\par \par \uc2 During the hearing, ACLU attorney Cecillia Wang questioned a provision of the law allowing police to detain people after a routine traffic stop if they suspect them of being in the country illegally. She said that would turn "law enforcement officers into immigration agents" and would subject innocent citizens to detention while their immigration status is determined.\par \par \uc2 Alabama Solicitor General John Neiman said illegal immigrants are already violating federal law by being "unlawfully" in the country.\par \par \uc2 Blackburn frequently interrupted attorneys and indicated she would address the issues in depth in her written ruling. She gave no indication when she would rule.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110824e78o000f7\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) - An \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who pleaded guilty to murder is suing Alabama officials, claiming the defense he received at taxpayer expense was inadequate.\par \par \uc2 The federal lawsuit has some of the defendants scratching their heads.\par \par \uc2 "There seems to be something wrong when an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  can file something with the judicial system when he was illegal to begin with," Houston County Commission Chairman Mark Culver said in Dothan.\par \par \uc2 Cenobio Sanchez is the lead plaintiff in what he hopes will become a class-action lawsuit on behalf of indigent defendants who have had court-appointed attorneys in Houston County. His attorney, Stephen Etheredge, said the case could have statewide impact because several counties are looking at adopting Houston County's system of indigent defense.\par \par \uc2 The lawsuit seeks unspecified financial damages, but Etheredge said the real aim is to get a better system in place for representing poor people who can't afford a lawyer.\par \par \uc2 In Houston County, two attorneys are on contract to handle indigent defense cases for each circuit judge.\par \par \uc2 Sanchez, 42, of Gordon was charged in 2007 with the stabbing death of his roommate during an argument over the volume of a radio. He pleaded guilty in 2009 to murder and possession of a fake Social Security card and a fake federal work permit. He was sentenced to 40 years for the murder and an additional five years for possession of the forged instruments.\par \par \uc2 He is suing the governor, the administrator of the state court system, and several Houston County officials. A second plaintiff, Tina Mikel of Cowarts, is also listed in the suit. She pleaded guilty to a drug charge. They are seeking to be representatives in a class-action lawsuit.\par \par \uc2 Sanchez argues that his defense was inadequate because his court-appointed attorney had a private law practice in addition to her county work and was handling 329 felony cases in 2008, plus 53 non-felony cases. He says that far exceeds the levels recommended by legal groups. He complains that his attorney lacked time to meet with him and investigate his case before trial. He says Houston County's system forces people to plead guilty because they know their attorneys will be poorly prepared if they go to trial.\par \par \uc2 His court-appointed attorney in the murder case, Valerie Judah, said Sanchez wanted to plead guilty because he thought the judge would order him returned to Mexico rather than sentence him to an Alabama prison.\par \par \uc2 Judah said she and other contract attorneys in Houston County have heavy caseloads. "But we have good win-lose ratios," she said in a phone interview Monday.\par \par \uc2 After pleading guilty, Sanchez went back to court in Houston County, contending that he lacked adequate legal representation when he entered the plea, but a Houston County judge rejected his argument. Sanchez is appealing .He is currently confined at the Easterling Correctional Facility in Clio, about 30 miles north of Dothan.\par \par \uc2 Phillip Rawls can be reached at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.twitter.com/PhillipRawls"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.twitter.com/PhillipRawls}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110823e78n001ji\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ATHENS, Ga. (AP) - About 25 young people, most wearing graduation caps and gowns, paraded across a busy intersection in Athens Tuesday and onto the University of Georgia campus to protest a new university system policy on the admission of illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Several dozen supporters chanted and cheered as the protesters, many of them high school students, walked through the arch onto the university's main quad, receiving fake diplomas in a mock graduation. Addressing their supporters and the media, a number of them publicly declared their illegal status.\par \par \uc2 "I want the education after high school because I don't want to end up a deadbeat," said 15-year-old Alejandro Galeana. "They're taking away the education that we have a right to."\par \par \uc2 The sophomore at Cedar Shoals High School in Athens was brought to the U.S. from Mexico when he was 2. He doesn't think it's fair that if he works hard enough to get the grades to qualify to go to one of the state's top schools that he should be denied admission because of his immigration status.\par \par \uc2 After the mock graduation, the protesters wound their way through the university's campus, ending up at the building that houses the admissions office where several of them spoke and led more chants as one of them used a spoon to pound out the beat on a saucepan.\par \par \uc2 Tuesday's protest was the latest in a string of demonstrations staged in recent months in Georgia by \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  young people and their supporters. Others include walkouts at several high schools at the end of last school year and rallies that have ended with protesters getting arrested for blocking traffic.\par \par \uc2 The policy, adopted last fall by the university system's Board of Regents, bars any state college or university that has rejected academically qualified applicants in the past two years from admitting illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 "Our institutions followed the Board's policy with respect to undocumented students," said Regents spokesman John Millsaps. "Students denied at these five campuses can still apply at other campuses."\par \par \uc2 The policy was enacted in response to public concerns that Georgia state colleges and universities were being overrun by illegal immigrants, that taxpayers were subsidizing their education and legal residents were being displaced. A study conducted by the university system's Board of Regents last year found that less than 1 percent of the state's public college students were illegal immigrants, and that students who pay out-of-state tuition -- which illegal immigrants are required to do -- more than pay for their education.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110823e78n001up\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 CROSSVILLE, Ala. (AP) - Most every face in Crossville's small downtown is white except at the elementary school. There, Spanish-speaking children with black hair and dark skin far outnumber their Caucasian classmates.\par \par \uc2 As much as anywhere in Alabama, Crossville is Exhibit A for supporters of a tough new state law cracking down on illegal immigration. And residents -- both English- and Spanish-speaking -- are paying close attention as a federal judge this week considers whether to let the law take effect Sept. 1.\par \par \uc2 U.S. District Judge Sharon Blackburn will hear arguments Wednesday in Birmingham from Hispanic organizations, public interest groups and religious leaders who want the law blocked. The Obama administration has also said the law should be blocked, arguing the state is unconstitutionally attempting to usurp federal immigration law.\par \par \uc2 The Alabama attorney general's office declined comment on how it will defend the law, but state legislators who support it filed court documents last week saying the federal government is illegally treading on state sovereignty.\par \par \uc2 About 90 miles northeast of Birmingham, Crossville looks like any other rural, mostly white city in the state. The main part of town is a mix of white-owned small businesses, churches and old homes.\par \par \uc2 But five miles west lies Kilpatrick, a community some Alabama-born residents call "little Tijuana" because of its overwhelming number of Spanish-speaking immigrants. There, roadside signs are in Spanish and many residents work in poultry plants. They live in mobile homes and send their children to town to attend the elementary school, which is about 65 percent Hispanic.\par \par \uc2 Census figures show 1,297 people live in Crossville, and all but nine of them are white. But DeKalb County, where Crossville is located, has more than 7,100 residents. Many live in Kilpatrick, where scores of families live along dirt roads cut into rolling fields. School buses loaded with Hispanic children make the trip each day between those dusty neighborhoods and Crossville Elementary.\par \par \uc2 Jeff Simpson runs a gas station in Crossville, and he's tired of seeing people he believes are illegal immigrants use state welfare money to buy food and other items. He said Alabama natives are spending too much educating the children of immigrants. Simpson believes legislators were right to pass a law that both supporters and critics say is the nation's toughest on illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 "I don't have anything against them, but I don't like them putting nothing into the system and getting free crap," Simpson said. "They're bleeding the government dry."\par \par \uc2 A few miles away in Kilpatrick, Ivan Barrera said the law already is hurting business at his supermarket. While school officials say Hispanic enrollment is up from last year, Barrera said some immigrant families are leaving out of fear of being stopped by police and put in jail if they don't have proper documents.\par \par \uc2 "It's hard for the Spanish-speaking people," said Barrera, a legal resident originally from Mexico who is married to a U.S. citizen. "They are scared of the police."\par \par \uc2 The law -- passed by Alabama's Republican-controlled Legislature and signed by Gov. Robert Bentley in June -- includes many of the same provisions as similar laws passed in states including Arizona and Georgia. Backers say the law is needed to prevent valuable services from going to people living in the state illegally and to save jobs for legal residents in of Alabama, where unemployment is 10 percent.\par \par \uc2 The sweeping law would let police check documents and arrest anyone suspected of being an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  if the person is stopped for some other reason. It also would require all businesses to check the legal status of workers using a federal database called E-Verify.\par \par \uc2 The law makes it a crime for landlords to knowingly rent to an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , hire an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  or give an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  a ride. It also requires public schools to check the immigration status of their students, although it doesn't bar illegal immigrants from attending public schools.\par \par \uc2 "We can't continue to let people flood over the border unchecked. It's a drain on our infrastructure and it's a security risk," said Brooklyn Roberts, executive director of the conservative Eagle Forum of Alabama, which lobbied for such a bill for years.\par \par \uc2 Plaintiffs in the lawsuit seeking to block the law include the Montgomery-based Alabama Appleseed Center for Law and Justice, where legal director Shay Farley said parts of the law step into federal powers and will likely be blocked based on similar laws and legal challenges in other states including Arizona.\par \par \uc2 "I believe the legal arguments are strong to block the law," she said.\par \par \uc2 At the Crossville Junk Store, where Hispanics sometimes come in to buy used clothes and other items, Pam Todd doesn't see Hispanics as a threat. She doesn't know which of her customers are in the country legally, but she said they all came to the United States as economic refugees trying to improve things for their families.\par \par \uc2 "They risked their lives to get here," she said. "I don't see illegal immigration as a problem, I see it as people looking for a better life."\par \par \uc2 At Crossville Elementary, Principal Ed Burke already is trying to figure out what to do if the judge allows the law to take effect as scheduled. Since public schools would be required to determine the immigration status of students, he's got to figure out how to devote more staff time to checking paperwork and filling out state reports in a school that he says could already use additional staff and teachers.\par \par \uc2 School workers who complain about the hundreds of Hispanic students at the elementary school and nearby Crossville High School don't realize they'd likely be unemployed without them, he said. Burke doesn't care for the law -- which he calls "lame brained" -- but he's also getting ready to do his part should it take effect at the end of the month.\par \par \uc2 "We have been advised by our board attorney here in DeKalb County that if this law does take effect that we will have to abide by it or we will be charged with not obeying the law," Burke said.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110821e78l001qy\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) - The man who chased down a suspected child abductor and saved a 6-year-old girl from what could have been a horrible fate was honored as a hero Friday. But he is also gaining a new kind of celebrity: as a poster child of sorts for immigration rights in state and national immigration debates.\par \par \uc2 Antonio Diaz Chacon, 23, is married to an American and has been in the country for four years. But Chacon says he abandoned attempts to get legal residency because the process was difficult and expensive.\par \par \uc2 Diaz Chacon revealed his immigration status to Univision this week and confirmed to The Associated Press that he is illegal, prompting chatter on the Internet and social networking sites that his case underscored immigrant rights positions in two ongoing political debates.\par \par \uc2 Some argue he is an example of the kind of immigrant the federal government will now largely leave alone. The Department of Homeland Security announced Thursday that deportations would focus on criminals.\par \par \uc2 "As exceptional as his story is," said Christina Parker, a spokeswoman for Border Network for Human Rights in El Paso, Texas, "it points to the fact that most undocumented immigrants living in the United States are not criminals. He's more than not a criminal now. He's a hero."\par \par \uc2 Others used it to blast New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez's ongoing attempts to repeal a state law that allows illegal immigrants to obtain a driver's license. The governor has put the repeal, which was defeated in the regular session earlier this year, on the agenda for a September special session.\par \par \uc2 "Most are just working to support their families and to take away their driver's license would be detrimental to that," Parker said.\par \par \uc2 Diaz Chacon's status didn't play a role in Albuquerque's decision to honor his bravery. Mayor Richard Berry declared Friday Antonio Diaz Chacon Day in Albuquerque and held an afternoon ceremony where he presented Diaz Chacon a Spanish language plaque recognizing his bravery in jumping in his pickup and chasing the suspect until he crashed into a light pole. Diaz Chacon then rescued the girl as the driver of the disabled van ran into the desert. The suspect was arrested later by police.\par \par \uc2 Diaz Chacon, with his wife and two daughters, was all smiles at the ceremony, which was also attended by the officers who eventually arrested accused kidnapper Phillip Garcia, 29.\par \par \uc2 "He says he is really happy and content and there's no larger words for it," his wife Martha, who was translating from Spanish for him, said. "It is a real large happiness."\par \par \uc2 Asked in a telephone interview with the AP Thursday what would be the best reward for his actions, he said he had already gotten it: a thank you letter from the little girl.\par \par \uc2 In deciding to hold the ceremony, city officials said the question of Diaz Chacon's immigration status never even came up. Nor was it mentioned at the event.\par \par \uc2 "Today's proclamation for Mr. Diaz Chacon is to celebrate the heroic actions that he demonstrated when he saved the life of a 6-year-old girl in danger," the mayor's spokesman, Chris Ramirez, said in a statement. "Mayor Berry is proud of Mr. Diaz Chacon's actions and joins the community in honoring his heroism."\par \par \uc2 The governor's office said its position was unchanged and accused "special interest groups shamefully exploiting this man, who may or may not be here illegally, to further their cause."\par \par \uc2 In a statement, the governor also cited "a litany of well-documented cases of this policy that put the public at risk, one of which occurred literally a few blocks away at a Denny's restaurant in 2009 when gang members from El Salvador who had driver's licenses committed a murder."\par \par \uc2 Marcela Diaz, with the Santa Fe-based Somos Un Pueblo Unido, said the larger question was the fact that Diaz Chacon could acknowledge to being illegal in New Mexico without fear of being deported, but the same might not be the case in other states.\par \par \uc2 "The question I would ask is, `Would this have played out the same way if we were in Arizona, or Georgia or Alabama?'" she asked.\par \par \uc2 For his part, Diaz Chacon isn't worried and said he doesn't regret saving the girl.\par \par \uc2 "I'm not worried. Why should I?" he said. "It's not like I committed a murder or a felony."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writers Susan Montoya Bryan in Albuquerque, N.M., and Juan Carlos Llorca in El Paso, Texas, contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110819e78j001ak\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

(AP) - A judge has dismissed a lawsuit brought by a conservative foundation against Montgomery College in Maryland over a school policy it said illegally offered reduced tuition to illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 A Montgomery County judge ruled Thursday that the plaintiff did not have a right to bring the lawsuit. Washington-based Judicial Watch sued the school in January. The lawsuit was brought after Maryland Delegate Patrick L. McKonough's said an audit of the school suggested its policy had cost taxpayers millions of dollars.\par \par \uc2 Montgomery College's policy is to offer in-county tuition rates to all recent graduates of Montgomery County public schools. The school has campuses in Germantown, Rockville and Takoma Park/Silver Spring.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110819e78j00101\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

On Thursday, the United States and its European allies demanded he step down.\par \par \uc2 Military operations have subsided in the past few days, following a fresh crackdown on major flashpoint cities that started at the beginning of the month to root out anti-government protesters.\par \par \uc2 But persistent gunfire and shootings, along with Friday's killings, underscore the difficulty of any kind of diplomatic pressure achieving results in the absence of any appetite for military intervention.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 3 men convicted in gruesome 1993 Cub Scout slayings go free after nearly 2 decades in prison\par \par \uc2 JONESBORO, Ark. (AP) -- Three men convicted in the nightmarish slayings of three Cub Scouts went free Friday, nearly two decades after they were sent to prison in a case so gruesome it raised suspicions the children had been sacrificed in a Satanic ritual.\par \par \uc2 Doubts about the evidence against the trio had persisted for years and threatened to force prosecutors to put on a second trial in 2012.\par \par \uc2 Instead, the so-called West Memphis Three were permitted to plead guilty to murder in exchange for time served, ending a long-running legal battle that had raised questions about DNA and key witnesses -- and attracted support from celebrities such as Eddie Vedder.\par \par \uc2 The men entered the pleas under a legal provision that allowed them to maintain their innocence while acknowledging that prosecutors had enough evidence to convict them.\par \par \uc2 "Although I am innocent, this plea is in my best interest," Jessie Misskelley said.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Stocks fall in afternoon trading as traders, seeking safety, sell in advance of the weekend\par \par \uc2 NEW YORK (AP) -- A growing belief that the U.S. economy is headed toward recession gave the stock market its fourth straight week of losses.\par \par \uc2 The anxiety in the market was obvious Friday as the major indexes went from modest gains early in the day to another sharp loss. The Dow Jones industrial average had its 10th move of more than 100 points this month.\par \par \uc2 "We just don't know whether we're going to have a recession," said John Burke, head of Burke Financial Strategies.\par \par \uc2 There was little news to help investors determine their next moves. \uc2 JPMorgan Chase & Co\uc2 . joined other financial firms and cut its forecast for economic growth during the fourth quarter. It's now predicting growth of 1 percent, down from an earlier forecast of 2.5 percent. That added to the recession fears.\par \par \uc2 Investors reacted to the news from late Thursday that \uc2 Hewlett-Packard Co\uc2 . was planning to exit most of its consumer businesses, including PCs. HP fell 20 percent to a six-year low as investors showed their misgivings about its plan to transform itself into a company that caters to corporations.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Taliban suicide attackers storm British residential compound in Afghan capital; 8 killed\par \par \uc2 KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) -- Taliban suicide bombers stormed a British compound in an upscale Kabul neighborhood shortly after dawn Friday, killing eight people during an eight-hour firefight as two English language teachers and their bodyguard hid in a locked panic room.\par \par \uc2 The assault came on the 92nd anniversary of Afghanistan's independence from Britain, and the Taliban described it as a warning to outsiders in the nearly decade-long war. The insurgents also hope to show that they remain a potent force despite taking heavy casualties from last year's buildup of U.S. and NATO troops.\par \par \uc2 Still, the attack ended up killing mostly Afghans -- five policemen and a municipal worker. The two other victims were a security guard of unknown nationality and a New Zealand special forces soldier who was shot in the chest as he tried to free hostages, according to New Zealand defense chief Lt. Gen. Rhys Jones.\par \par \uc2 The soldier was the first member of the New Zealand Special Air Service, which mentors Afghan security forces, to be killed in this country.\par \par \uc2 Sixteen others were wounded in the attack on the British Council, an international charity that gives leadership training and does other work toward a post-conflict Afghanistan.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Obama faces discontent among liberal groups as he faces re-election; will base come through?\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) -- Liberals argue that he caved on the debt ceiling. Unions are upset over his handling of unemployment and labor issues. Hispanics brought the immigration debate directly to his campaign doorstep.\par \par \uc2 President Barack Obama's summer of discontent has been marked by rumblings within his Democratic political base over his willingness to fight congressional Republicans and his approach to fixing the economy.\par \par \uc2 Liberals disappointed with Obama for compromising with the GOP during the debt-ceiling showdown now are calling on him to hold firm against Republicans this fall. They want him to push a bold jobs agenda while drawing a strong line on taxes and protecting Medicare and Social Security.\par \par \uc2 In recent weeks, the gripes have become so loud that the president himself acknowledged them during his Midwest bus tour this week.\par \par \uc2 "I've got a whole bunch of responsibilities, which means I have to make choices sometimes that are unattractive and I know will be bad for me politically and I know will get supporters of mine disappointed," Obama said in Iowa. He claimed progress on the economy, health care and two wars. And, offering his backers a bit of tough love, he added: "Sometimes you've got to make choices in order to do what's best for the country at that particular moment, and that's what I've tried to do."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Moammar Gadhafi's forces launch counterattack against Libyan rebel advance toward Tripoli\par \par \uc2 ZAWIYA, Libya (AP) -- Moammar Gadhafi's forces launched a fierce counterattack in a strategic western city on Friday, firing rockets, mortar shells and anti-aircraft guns in a bid to keep the rebels from gaining complete control and advancing toward the capital, only 30 miles away.\par \par \uc2 NATO's bombing campaign has made it difficult for the regime to send massive reinforcements to Zawiya, enabling the rebels to maintain a foothold in their biggest prize in months. But Friday's fierce onslaught by regime forces signaled an opposition push toward Tripoli, Gadhafi's main stronghold, would be arduous and bloody.\par \par \uc2 Dealing another blow to the increasingly isolated leader, Libyan rebels said Friday that Abdel-Salam Jalloud, a close Gadhafi associate who was once the No. 2 top regime official, has defected.\par \par \uc2 Jalloud helped Gadhafi stage the 1969 coup that propelled him to power and transformed Libya from a monarchy to a republic. He was Gadhafi's most trusted deputy for two decades but began to clash with the leader starting in the 1990s.\par \par \uc2 Rebel spokesman Mahmoud Shammam said that Jalloud had fled to a rebel-held area in the western mountains and was on his way to Europe. Pictures showing Jalloud in the western town of Zintan appeared on rebel \uc2 Facebook\uc2  pages. Jalloud did not issue any statements, but Shammam said he had confirmed the defection on the telephone.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 NM hero who saved girl says he's an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  because getting residency is too hard\par \par \uc2 ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- The man who chased down a suspected child abductor and saved a 6-year-old girl from what could have been a horrible fate was honored as a hero Friday. But he is also gaining a new kind of celebrity: as a poster child of sorts for immigration rights in state and national immigration debates.\par \par \uc2 Antonio Diaz Chacon, 23, is married to an American and has been in the country for four years. But Chacon says he abandoned attempts to get legal residency because the process was difficult and expensive.\par \par \uc2 Diaz Chacon revealed his immigration status to Univision this week and confirmed to The Associated Press that he is illegal, prompting chatter on the Internet and social networking sites that his case underscored immigrant rights positions in two ongoing political debates.\par \par \uc2 Some argue he is an example of the kind of immigrant the federal government will now largely leave alone. The Department of Homeland Security announced Thursday that deportations would focus on criminals.\par \par \uc2 "As exceptional as his story is," said Christina Parker, a spokeswoman for Border Network for Human Rights in El Paso, Texas, "it points to the fact that most undocumented immigrants living in the United States are not criminals. He's more than not a criminal now. He's a hero."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors say they made mistake showing inadmissible evidence, but Clemens should be retried\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) -- Prosecutors in the Roger Clemens perjury case said Friday they had made an honest mistake in showing jurors inadmissible evidence and that shouldn't save the baseball star from facing a new trial.\par \par \uc2 The prosecutors filed arguments disputing Clemens' position that a second trial would violate his constitutional protection against double jeopardy by making him face the same charges twice.\par \par \uc2 Clemens had argued the showing of the evidence was a deliberate ploy to invoke a mistrial because the prosecutors' case was going badly. But the prosecutors say their case remains strong and Clemens wants to "gain an unwarranted windfall from this inadvertent error."\par \par \uc2 The prosecutors said it was an oversight when they showed jurors a video clip that mentioned that Clemens' teammate told his wife that Clemens admitted using performance-enhancing drugs -- evidence the judge had ruled inadmissible. The filing is the prosecutors' first public admission of wrongdoing in the case and first explanation of what went wrong.\par \par \uc2 The prosecutors wrote it was their duty to make sure that evidence was not included in their exhibits. "The government accepts responsibility for its oversight, and regrets the burdens that error has placed on this court and defendant," they wrote, but argued the mistake was due to the press of other trial matters and was not intentional.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 APNewsBreak: Firms propose cultural trip for foreign students in Pa. Hershey chocolate protest\par \par \uc2 HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- Companies involved in employing foreign students who walked off their jobs in protest at a plant that serves the Hershey chocolate manufacturer have developed a plan to send the students on a trip to see some of the United States' cultural and historical landmarks, although a spokesman for the students reacted coolly to the idea.\par \par \uc2 Rick Anaya, chief executive of the Council for Educational Travel USA, the nonprofit that helped bring the students to the U.S., said the plan emerged Friday after a two-hour conference call with representatives of the other three companies involved in their employment at a chocolate distribution center just outside Hershey.\par \par \uc2 "We're actually doing this on our dime," Anaya said, including paid time off for the student-workers. "We're paying for this trip. We're just fleshing out the details."\par \par \uc2 Students walked off the job at an \uc2 Exel Inc\uc2 .-run facility on Wednesday, saying the work was so strenuous and low-paying that they were unable to see very much of the country they came to visit. Exel said it doesn't intend to have students who hold J-1 visas, which supply resorts and other businesses with cheap seasonal labor as part of a program aimed at fostering cultural understanding, work at the facility after the current group finishes in about a month.\par \par \uc2 Saket Soni, executive director of the New Orleans-based National Guestworker Alliance, which has helped organize the students, said Friday that the initial reaction by leaders among the students was to take a wait-and-see posture.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Woot! Online terms retweet and sexting enter Concise Oxford English Dictionary\par \par \uc2 LONDON (AP) -- Woot! The online expression of enthusiasm is now in the dictionary. So are textspeak, sexting -- and, less happily, cyberbullying.\par \par \uc2 They are among 400 new entries in the 12th edition of the Concise Oxford English Dictionary, published this month.\par \par \uc2 Another newcomer to the reference book's 24,000 entries is retweet -- to repost another Twitter user's message.\par \par \uc2 Editor Angus Stevenson revealed some of the new entries in a blog post Thursday.\par \par \uc2 Some of the new words describe forms of behavior and communication created by technology. There's cyberbullying, a form of online abuse, and textspeak, the abbreviated language used in cell phone messages. And, of course, sexting -- sending explicit photos or messages by mobile phone.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110819e78j000of\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 KENNEWICK, Wash. (AP) - A city council candidate in Kennewick has advanced to the general election on a platform that includes calling for illegal immigrants to be executed if they refuse to leave town.\par \par \uc2 Loren Nichols collected nearly 400 votes in his ward -- that's about 26 percent of Tuesday's primary vote, enough to place second out of three candidates. He'll face incumbent Steve Young, who also serves as mayor, in the citywide general election this fall.\par \par \uc2 Nichols, 56, has said in media interviews that if illegal immigrants are seen entering the country illegally they should be shot on sight, and any who refuse an ultimatum to leave Kennewick should also face the death penalty. He didn't return an email from The Associated Press seeking comment Thursday, and his outgoing voice mail message said, "I'm taking a break away from my campaign phone for a while."\par \par \uc2 "Illegal entry into and occupation of our city by illegal aliens constitutes rape of Kennewick," he wrote in his official candidate statement. "This is not a misdemeanor. This is an offense that warrants the highest penalty."\par \par \uc2 Young said Thursday he's not surprised Nichols finished second. The candidate who finished last, William Miller, declined to say anything publicly about his political positions. He didn't even publish a candidate statement in the voter pamphlet.\par \par \uc2 But it is surprising that Nichols received as many votes as he did, Young said. Young garnered 939 votes.\par \par \uc2 "I take any opponent seriously, and I take threats of violence from other people seriously," Young said. "This isn't what we want to be proud of in our city. I certainly don't think a majority of people in Kennewick feel that way."\par \par \uc2 Young said he understands that the issue of illegal immigration has inflamed many people, and he said he agrees that the U.S. has a dysfunctional immigration system. But he also said the city of Kennewick has little authority to weigh in on the issue, and he said he believes the societal costs of illegal immigration have been overstated in certain quarters. Illegal immigrants have caused few problems in Kennewick beyond driving without licenses or car insurance, he said.\par \par \uc2 Many farmers in central Washington rely on \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  labor.\par \par \uc2 And, Young said, Kennewick has much more pressing issues than immigration to deal with. Thousands of workers contracted to clean up the nearby Hanford Nuclear Reservation face the possibility of imminent layoffs, and as the reservation is cleaned up, fewer workers will be needed there, so it's important for the city to diversify its economy, he said.\par \par \uc2 "We've got to create jobs," Young said. "The state of Washington has pulled a lot of money away from economic development and tourism, leaving communities to fend for themselves."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110818e78i002nl\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc40}{\*\bkmkend toc40}\b \uc2 US plans to make it a priority to deport illegal immigrants who are convicted criminals\b0\par\par\uc2 By ALICIA A. CALDWELL   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 972 \uc2 words\par \uc2 18 August 2011\par 18:34\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2011.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) - The Obama administration said Thursday it will allow many illegal immigrants facing deportation the chance to stay in this country and apply for a work permit, while focusing on removing from the U.S. convicted criminals and those who might be a national security or public safety threat.\par \par \uc2 That will mean a case-by-case review of approximately 300,000 illegal immigrants facing possible deportation in federal immigration courts, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said in announcing the policy change.\par \par \uc2 Advocates for an immigration overhaul have said that the administration, by placing all illegal immigrants in the same category for deportation, has failed to live up to its promise to only deport the "worst of the worst," as President Barack Obama has said.\par \par \uc2 "From a law enforcement and public safety perspective, DHS enforcement resources must continue to be focused on our highest priorities," Napolitano wrote a group of senators supporting new immigration legislation. "Doing otherwise hinders our public safety mission -- clogging immigration court dockets and diverting DHS enforcement resources away from the individuals who pose a threat to public safety."\par \par \uc2 The Associated Press obtained a copy of the letter.\par \par \uc2 Republicans complained that the new policy circumvents Congress.\par \par \uc2 "They have created a working group that appears to have the specific purpose of overruling, on a `case-by-case' basis, an immigration court's final order of removal, or preventing that court from even issuing such an order," House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith, R-Texas, said in a statement. "The Obama administration should enforce immigration laws, not look for ways to ignore them. The Obama administration should not pick and choose which laws to enforce. Administration officials should remember the oath of office they took to uphold the Constitution and the laws of the land."\par \par \uc2 Some states are rebelling against another administration effort to control illegal immigration known as Secure Communities. The program requires that when state and local law enforcement send criminal suspects' fingerprints to the FBI, the prints are run through an immigration database to determine the person's immigration status. States have argued that the program puts them in the position of policing immigration, which they consider a federal responsibility. Immigrant advocacy groups have complained that people who had not yet been convicted of a crime were being caught up in the system.\par \par \uc2 In June, the director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, John Morton, sent a memo to agents outlining when and how they could use discretion in immigration cases. That guidance also covered those potentially subject to a legislative proposal, known as the DREAM Act, intended to give young illegal immigrants who go to college or serve in the military a chance at legal status.\par \par \uc2 Morton also suggested that agents consider how long someone has been in the United State, whether that person's spouse or children are U.S. citizens and whether that person has a criminal record.\par \par \uc2 A senior administration official said delaying deportation decisions in cases for some non-criminals would allow quicker deportation of serious criminals. The indefinite stay will not give illegal immigrants a path to legal permanent residency, but will let them apply for a work permit.\par \par \uc2 "As a matter of law, they are eligible for a work authorization card, basically a taxpayer ID card, but that decision is made separately and on a case-by-case basis," said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discussed the change publicly.\par \par \uc2 The official said the change will give authorities the chance to keep some cases from even reaching the court system. The message to agents in the field, the official said, would be "you do not need to put everyone you come across in the system."\par \par \uc2 If an immigrant whose case has been stayed commits a crime or other circumstances change, their case could be reopened.\par \par \uc2 The decision was welcome news for people who have already been ordered out of the country but are fighting to stay.\par \par \uc2 Julio Calderon, 21, a Florida college student and \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Honduras, has been fighting his deportation order since he was 16.\par \par \uc2 "It's an important step for the human rights of undocumented immigrants," Calderon said.\par \par \uc2 Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., a longtime supporter of immigration overhaul and the DREAM Act, applauded the policy change.\par \par \uc2 "These students are the future doctors, lawyers, teachers and, maybe, senators, who will make America stronger," Durbin said in an emailed statement. "We need to be doing all we can to keep these talented, dedicated, American students here, not wasting increasingly precious resources sending them away to countries they barely remember."\par \par \uc2 Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, said the Obama administration was implementing reforms "against the will of Congress and the majority of American people we represent."\par \par \uc2 "It is just the latest attempt by this president to bypass the intended legislative process when he does not get his way," McCaul said in a statement. "The fact that we have a backlog and prioritize deportations is nothing new. This policy goes a step further granting illegal immigrants a fast-track to gaining a work permit where they will now unfairly compete with more than 9 percent of Americans who are still looking for jobs."\par \par \uc2 Other Republicans have previously criticized the DREAM Act and other immigration legislation that would provide a path to legal status as amnesty. Following Morton's June memo, Smith introduced a bill to block the administration's use of prosecutorial discretion and called the use of that discretion "backdoor amnesty."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writers Sophia Tareen in Chicago and Laura Wides-Munoz in Miami contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Alicia A.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) - A man described as responsible for recruiting individuals to harvest and cultivate marijuana plants on a large pot farm that authorities say is linked to Mexican drug cartels was sentenced to two years in prison Wednesday, the longest sentence handed down to any of the 11 defendants arrested a year ago.\par \par \uc2 Authorities said Jose Vilchiz-Garcia, 28, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Mexico, also directed the purchase of supplies for the operation.\par \par \uc2 Vilchiz-Garcia and a second man, Daniel Zarco-Aguilar, who received a 20-month sentence Wednesday, were the last men sentenced in the case. All pleaded guilty to conspiracy to knowingly and intentionally manufacturing more than 1,000 marijuana plants.\par \par \uc2 Zarco-Aguilar's attorney declined to comment, and Vilchiz-Garcia's attorney did not immediately return a message seeking comment. Attorneys for other defendants have said in the past that the men were essentially day laborers duped into working on the farm and many did not know what they had been hired to do until they were driven to the operation in rural Muskingum County.\par \par \uc2 All but one of the 11 are illegal immigrants from Mexico and face deportation once their sentences are up. Saul Vargas-Garcia, for example, who received a sentence of 12 months and a day, has been turned over to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, according to a court filing Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 Most of the men were arrested at a riverside camp in Muskingum County in eastern Ohio last September.\par \par \uc2 Complaints filed in the case by U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration officers say numerous men were found at the camp separating marijuana buds and plants when the farm was raided on Sept. 20. The complaints say the marijuana growing operation was in an area of dense woods north of the Muskingum River and that the site had a base camp with a tent, sleeping bags, food, cooking equipment and gardening tools.\par \par \uc2 The documents say investigators were led to the farm as they conducted surveillance on Hugo Ayala of Columbus near a farm in Logan County in west-central Ohio. Ayala previously pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 14 months in prison.\par \par \uc2 State authorities say the operation was the third bearing the marks of Mexican cartels discovered in Ohio in the last year.\par \par \uc2 Earlier this month, state and local authorities said they found more than 17,000 marijuana plants in southeast Ohio with an estimated street value of millions of dollars.\par \par \uc2 In August 2010, police in Pike County in southern Ohio said 22,000 plants found growing on two adjoining properties had an estimated street value of about $22 million.\par \par \uc2 In recent years, federal drug authorities have come across evidence of Mexican cartel growing operations on public land in the west and more recently in Wisconsin.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Andrew Welsh-Huggins can be reached at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://twitter.com/awhcolumbus"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://twitter.com/awhcolumbus}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110817e78h000t8\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

Defense attorney Ivan Klein sought a 10-year sentence, telling U.S. District Judge that the defendant grew up in "primitive circumstances" in Guatemala.\par \par \uc2 The judge said Marcos-Marcos showed a callous disregard for the victims in the case, but that a life sentence was excessive for the crimes committed. He also ordered Marcos-Marcos to serve five years of probation.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors said Marcos-Marcos ordered the brutal treatment of a Salvadoran who was rescued in 2009 after being attacked with a cattle prod and kept in a Lancaster drop house without clothes or blankets. The victim told investigators that his captors beat him repeatedly and starved him for days until they could collect $6,000 in smuggling fees.\par \par \uc2 A police report said Marcos-Marcos also ran another drop house in San Bernardino where several people were held against their will, including a woman who was raped when relatives didn't pay her smuggling fee.\par \par \uc2 He was convicted in 2004 of harboring illegal aliens in a case brought by federal authorities in Arizona.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110816e78g0003i\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

(AP) - Prince William County is filing a second lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security seeking access to criminal immigration data.\par \par \uc2 The lawsuit filed Thursday in federal court in Alexandria faults federal officials for ignoring a Freedom of Information Act request from the county. The request sought information on the status of more than 4,000 illegal immigrants arrested by local police and transferred into custody of federal immigration authorities.\par \par \uc2 Corey Stewart, chairman of the county's Board of Supervisors, says large numbers of illegal immigrants are being released rather than deported. More than 10 percent of those turned over to immigration authorities by the county have been re-arrested.\par \par \uc2 An earlier lawsuit seeking details on the case of an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  charged with killing a nun in a drunken driving crash remains unresolved.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110804e784002j0\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) - The Obama administration is challenging Alabama's new law that would let police detain those stopped for traffic offenses who they suspect are in the country illegally, a statute described as one of the toughest immigration regulations nationwide.\par \par \uc2 In a complaint Monday, the U.S. Justice Department said Alabama's law conflicts with federal law and undermines federal immigration priorities. The lawsuit argues that the state law also expands opportunities for police to push immigrants toward jail for various new immigration crimes.\par \par \uc2 The law is set to take effect Sept. 1. It also makes it a crime to knowingly give a ride or provide shelter to an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  and requires schools to report the immigration status of students. Alabama employers would be required to use a federal system called E-Verify to determine if new workers are in the country legally.\par \par \uc2 The Justice Department, in its filing in Birmingham federal court, said a state cannot set its own immigration policy and cannot pass laws that conflict with federal immigration laws.\par \par \uc2 "To put it in terms we relate to here in Alabama, you can only have one quarterback in a football game. In immigration, the federal government is the quarterback," said Joyce Vance, U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Alabama.\par \par \uc2 Already the law is facing mounting opposition.\par \par \uc2 Also Monday, a coalition of religious leaders challenged its legality. The lawsuit by Roman Catholic, United Methodist and Episcopal bishops says it "makes it a crime to follow God's command to be Good Samaritans."\par \par \uc2 Last month, a coalition of civil and immigrant rights groups also asked a court to bar the law from taking effect. U.S. District Judge Sharon Blackburn in Birmingham has scheduled a hearing for Aug. 24 to consider that.\par \par \uc2 The law's sponsor Republican state Rep. Micky Hammon defended it.\par \par \uc2 "The Obama administration and the federal bureaucrats have turned a blind eye toward the immigration issue and refuse to fulfill their constitutional duty to enforce laws already on the books. Now, they want to block our efforts to secure Alabama's borders and prevent our jobs and taxpayer dollars from disappearing into the abyss that illegal immigration causes," Hammon said.\par \par \uc2 "Allowing hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants to run unchecked under the radar threatens our homeland security and insults those who come here legally," he added.\par \par \uc2 The law requires public schools to determine the immigration status of its students and whether they qualify for classes in English as a second language.\par \par \uc2 Opponents contend that provision could have a chilling effect by -- for instance -- potentially discouraging parents in the U.S. illegally from enrolling children even if those youngsters are citizens. Officials counter that the state's tough stance won't prohibit any child -- \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  or not -- from enrolling in public school.\par \par \uc2 In a Department of Justice statement, Attorney General Eric Holder and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said immigration enforcement is the job of the federal government.\par \par \uc2 "Legislation like this diverts critical law enforcement resources from the most serious threats to public safety," Napolitano said.\par \par \uc2 The Justice Department's complaint quoted Birmingham police chief A.C. Roper as saying the law would divert scarce resources from local policing priorities to immigration enforcement.\par \par \uc2 Last year, the justice department obtained a preliminary injunction against a similarly tough Arizona immigration law.\par \par \uc2 The ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project director Cecillia Wang said she welcomes the lawsuits. As one of the attorneys in the civil rights lawsuits, she said the various legal challenges highlight the problems with the law that the Legislature passed in June.\par \par \uc2 "It is a law that really tramples on civil rights, civil liberties and religious freedoms in the state of Alabama," Wang said.\par \par \uc2 Ohers disagree.\par \par \uc2 A spokesman for Alabama Republican House Speaker Mike Hubbard said it was disappointing that the federal government has not enforced immigration law.\par \par \uc2 "If the federal government wants to help it should do its job, close the border and enact serious immigration reform," said Todd Stacy.\par \par \uc2 ----------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writers Ted Yost in Washington and Jim Van Anglin in Montgomery contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 5\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110802e78200025\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) - Officials say the state's tough new immigration law won't prohibit any child -- \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  or not -- from enrolling in Alabama's public schools, and record-keeping requirements shouldn't be a burden for those registering students at local schools.\par \par \uc2 "It has nothing to do with enrollment," said Tommy Bice, deputy state school superintendent for instructional services.\par \par \uc2 Bice said the state is sending information to local schools about how to deal with enrolling students in the wake of the new law, which requires public schools to determine students' immigration status and whether they qualify for classes in English as a second language.\par \par \uc2 The law, which takes effect Sept. 1, faces several court challenges. It also makes it a crime in Alabama to knowingly give an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  a ride and allows police to arrest anyone suspected of being an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  if they're stopped for any other reason. Alabama employers also are now required to use a federal system called E-Verify to determine if new workers are in the country legally.\par \par \uc2 State officials had said previously that the measure, which became law in June, was not intended to keep illegal immigrants from enrolling. Opponents say the law could have a chilling effect, for example, discouraging parents living in the United States illegally from enrolling their children -- even if the youngsters are citizens.\par \par \uc2 "There's no doubt about it," said Sam Brooke, an attorney with the Southern Poverty Law Center -- one of the group's challenging the law. "There can be no question about that."\par \par \uc2 Brooke said the Department of Justice and the Department of Education sent a joint letter in May to schools across the country cautioning them that it is violation of federal law to inquire about a student's immigration status.\par \par \uc2 Bice said state officials were focused on being fair to students and local school personnel, as well as following the law.\par \par \uc2 He said students enrolled before Sept. 1 will not be affected, regardless of whether they are U.S. citizens or illegal immigrants. Those who enroll after that date and don't have a birth certificate can still attend school, he said.\par \par \uc2 A process has been established for their parents to secure other documentation proving their children's immigration status, he said. A code eventually will be entered in a statewide database of students if the school does not receive that documentation, he said.\par \par \uc2 Under the new law, state school officials will have to send a report to the Legislature after the school year ends detailing the cost of educating illegal immigrants. The law does not outline how to determine such costs, Bice said. Officials will be working on a way to gather and analyze that information in coming months.\par \par \uc2 Bice said there initially was a great deal of talk about the law being a burden on schools, but officials do not believe that will be the case. He noted that the vast majority of schools in the state require a birth certificate to prove a child's age before kindergarten.\par \par \uc2 "This isn't going to be a big shift," said Bice, adding that the new requirements shouldn't "seem that odd to parents."\par \par \uc2 Brooke agreed that schools can require birth certificates for questions of age and residency but contended that it is illegal to use them to determine immigration status.\par \par \uc2 "You can't be asking about immigration status for any reason," he said.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110801e781002x2\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) - Malaysia began registering up to 2 million \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  workers Monday in an amnesty program aimed at managing waves of foreigners seeking menial jobs unwanted by Malaysians.\par \par \uc2 The program should make it easier to fill labor shortages for low-paying jobs at palm oil plantations, factories, construction sites and restaurants.\par \par \uc2 It also means foreigners like Bangladeshi Jueil Bepari, who for three years has done odd jobs including working as a gas station attendant, will no longer have to dodge Malaysian authorities for fear of being jailed, whipped with a cane or deported.\par \par \uc2 "I am always in fear of being caught. I dare not go to the shops or visit my friends," 23-year-old Bepari said after registering and receiving a six-month pass to stay in the country while applying for a work permit.\par \par \uc2 The government hopes that absorbing illegal laborers like Bepari into the mainstream work force it can allow outsiders to take up the many menial jobs shunned by locals. It also plans to build an immigrant database, including fingerprints, to improve security.\par \par \uc2 Malaysia has some 4 million foreign workers, only half of whom are in the Southeast Asian country legally. Despite years of earlier efforts to cut dependence on foreign labor, demand for foreign workers is likely to keep growing at a yearly average of 6-7 percent until 2015 -- twice as fast as the overall labor market, according to director Shamsuddin Bardan of the Malaysian Employers Federation.\par \par \uc2 As a relatively wealthy nation in the region, Malaysia attracts people from impoverished or war-torn places including Indonesia, Bangladesh and Myanmar who seek stability, better economic opportunity or a way to enter other countries such as Australia.\par \par \uc2 The amnesty program involves fingerprinting each immigrant worker and checking their employment credentials. Officials said those not already employed or unable to join the work force would be deported.\par \par \uc2 One Malaysian state began the program earlier on July 18. Eastern Sabah, on Borneo island, has so far signed up 116,000 workers, the Home Ministry said. Sabah ends its program Aug. 8, while the rest of the country finishes Aug. 14.\par \par \uc2 Some labor activists urged the government to halt the program, saying more oversight is needed to prevent workers from being treated unfairly. Rights groups Tenaganita and the Malaysian Trade Union Congress voiced concern that workers whose employers did not renew their work visas could also be penalized.\par \par \uc2 They also alleged that some of the 336 companies hired to help run the program were charging more than the allowed 35-ringgit ($12) registration fee.\par \par \uc2 The Immigration Department vowed to investigate any alleged violations, communications director Aiza Mahani Mozi said, without elaborating on whether complaints had been received.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110801e781001s7\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 CHICAGO (AP) - Illinois made it easier for illegal immigrants to pay for college when Gov. Pat Quinn signed a law Monday creating a privately funded college scholarship program.\par \par \uc2 "We say to all the people of our country and our state, we want everybody in and nobody left out," Quinn, a Democrat, told a packed auditorium at a high school in a Latino neighborhood of Chicago. "Education is the key to opportunity in a democracy."\par \par \uc2 The Illinois Dream Act creates a nine-member commission to establish scholarships for immigrant children with private donations, not taxpayer money. Quinn, who will appoint the commission members, was quick to personally pledge $1,000 to the fund.\par \par \uc2 The effort still requires fundraising before any scholarships can be awarded.\par \par \uc2 Immigrant children here legally and illegally can qualify if they attend an Illinois high school for at least three years and have at least one parent who immigrated to the United States.\par \par \uc2 Private scholarships are among the few ways that illegal immigrants can pay for college because they don't qualify for government financial aid. Illinois already offers in-state tuition rates to illegal immigrants at public universities.\par \par \uc2 The new law also lets anyone with a Social Security number or taxpayer identification number to enroll in state-run college savings programs. It also requires high school counselors to provide college information to immigrant children.\par \par \uc2 Tania Unzueta, a 27-year-old graduate student at the University of Illinois-Chicago was ecstatic about the new law.\par \par \uc2 "It's been so frustrating to know undocumented young people who don't graduate from high school because they don't think they can go to college," she said.\par \par \uc2 Some critics have complained the new law is misguided.\par \par \uc2 Republican State Rep. David Harris of Arlington Heights voted against the measure. "Why are we setting up a state structure to handle private money. It doesn't make sense to me," he said.\par \par \uc2 Unzueta said she is lucky to have gone to college and on to graduate school, something that more people will now be able to do because of increased access to private scholarships under the law. But Unzueta, who has been in the United States since she was 10, said that still doesn't solve the problem of what illegal immigrants do after college because they are not legally allowed to work in this country.\par \par \uc2 "I have one more year to graduate and I don't know what I'm going to do next," she said.\par \par \uc2 Unzueta said there needs to be comprehensive immigration reform.\par \par \uc2 Proposed federal legislation with a name similar to Illinois' new law would give some illegal immigrants a path to citizenship. Illinois' law has no impact on a person's immigration status.\par \par \uc2 Arianna Salgado, 18, of Melrose Park, who said she is recent high school graduate, worked with activist groups to get the new law passed. She said she already has private scholarship money to attend Dominican University in suburban Chicago in the fall where she plans to study political science.\par \par \uc2 "We deserve the same opportunities to continue with our higher education because we have the same dedication and commitment as our peers," said Salgado, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Republican Rep. Angelo "Skip" Saviano of Elmwood Park thanked Latino lawmakers at the bill signing for their work to get the measure passed in Illinois' Democrat-controlled General Assembly.\par \par \uc2 "We have to offer people opportunities to help themselves and this piece of legislation is totally about just that," Saviano said.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110801e781001n9\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) - Texas Gov. Rick Perry raised nearly $103 million in campaign contributions from his first inauguration as governor in 2001 through 2010, according to a published report.\par \par \uc2 Almost half of that money has been given by 204 "mega-donors" of $100,000 or more, according to Texans for Public Justice, a state campaign finance watchdog.\par \par \uc2 Perry's biggest contributors include Houston homebuilder Bob Perry, who bankrolled the negative "Swift Boat" campaign against 2004 Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported in Sunday's edition.\par \par \uc2 Houston homebuilder Bob Perry, who is not related to the governor, has given more than $2.5 million to Perry's campaigns since 2000. The only bigger source of campaign funds for Rick Perry has been the Republican Governors Association, which has given $4 million to the Texas Republican's gubernatorial campaigns.\par \par \uc2 Texas allows unlimited individual contributions in state races. Democratic candidates have had Houston trial lawyer and outspoken Perry critic Steve Mostyn as a big contributor.\par \par \uc2 Rick Perry is seen by many as a potential candidate for the GOP presidential nomination but has not formally entered the race. However, he has been trying to expand his fundraising net nationwide while taking stock of how much of his state financial base he can count on.\par \par \uc2 Bob Perry donated almost $4.5 million to the "Swift Boat Veterans for Truth" campaign that challenged 2004 Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry's account of his Vietnam War record. Michael Beckel, spokesman for the nonprofit monitor of federal campaign spending, Center for Responsive Politics, said Perry "is One of the most high-profile conservative donors out there."\par \par \uc2 Perry also is a major donor to charitable causes such as orphanages throughout Mexico and Central America. He also has backed the Mexican-American Legislative Caucus and helped apply pressure to block anti-\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  legislation in this year's special session of the Texas Legislature.\par \par \uc2 Speculation on whether Bob Perry will be a major backer of a Rick Perry presidential campaign is premature, said Anthony Holm, the homebuilder's spokesman. "Gov. Perry hasn't announced, and we don't know if he will announce," he told the Star-Telegram.\par \par \uc2 Dallas billionaire Harold Simmons is Rick Perry's third-biggest giver with more than $1.1 million during Perry's administration. Simmons is developing a disposal site in West Texas for low-level radioactive waste that has drawn criticism from the environmental lobby.\par \par \uc2 Simmons subsidiary Waste Control Specialists, which is developing the disposal site, has noted that extensive testing shows the facility will be safe. Environmental lobbyists say it's the shipping of nuclear waste from out of state on Texas highways that concerns them.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Information from: Fort Worth Star-Telegram, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.star-telegram.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.star-telegram.com}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110731e77v0047g\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The sentence was the longest allowed by law for what was essentially lying about who was really buying the guns.\par \par \uc2 Crane told the 29-year-old Barrientos he was responsible for the illegal purchase of 38 semi-automatic rifles.\par \par \uc2 Court documents show that Barrientos paid the straw buyers and encouraged some to recruit others. He was arrested after agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives saw him accept guns from a cooperating defendant.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110727e77r002k7\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) - Gov. Jerry Brown on Monday signed a bill that will let students who entered the country illegally receive private financial aid at California's public colleges, even as debate continues over a more contentious bill that would allow access to public funding.\par \par \uc2 The Democratic governor signed AB130 at Los Angeles City College. It is the first of a two-bill package referred to as the California Dream Act, which is aimed at getting financial aid for college students who entered the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 "It's crucial that we invest in every child that lives and is born in this state. Signing this Dream Act is another piece of investment in people because people drives the culture, the economy," Brown told a crowd of about 100 students and community leaders who gathered inside the city college's library. "This is another piece of a very important mosaic which is a California that works for everyone."\par \par \uc2 The governor did not address the second bill in the package, which is more contentious because it would allow illegal immigrants to receive state-funded scholarships and financial aid. That bill, AB131, is in the state Senate.\par \par \uc2 The legislative package authored by state Assemblyman Gil Cedillo, D-Los Angeles, differs from the federal Dream Act, which would include a path to citizenship for those bought to the country illegally as children.\par \par \uc2 Critics of the package say granting public or private financial aid to illegal immigrants will force citizens and students who are here legally to compete with them for limited resources. Assemblyman Tim Donnelly, R-Twin Peaks, said California's public colleges and universities have already had to raise tuition fees in the face of recent budget cuts.\par \par \uc2 "Bottom line is California doesn't have enough money to take care of its obligations to its citizens right now," Donnelly said. "The people, who if they're lucky enough to have jobs, certainly would like those limited resources to go to their children or grandchildren. They certainly wouldn't want that to go to people who come here illegally."\par \par \uc2 Cedillo said he admired the students without legal status because of the obstacles they have had to overcome. He said allowing students to qualify for private scholarships and financial aid is one step that will help them get through college.\par \par \uc2 "Public education in this great state and this great country is a great equalizer of society," he said.\par \par \uc2 California's community college and public universities systems support the bill, noting that it affects less than 1 percent of their student population. According to the University of California, fewer than 80 students across its system of more than 220,000 students would be affected by the bill signed Monday.\par \par \uc2 The California State University estimated that some of the 3,600 students who have permission to pay in-state tuition rates even though they lack legal documentation could be affected by the new law. The CSU system enrolls about 440,000 students.\par \par \uc2 At least one student who stands to benefit from the California Dream Act said an education will improve his perspective and quality of life even if he'll still have trouble finding work out of college. Rigoberto Barboza, a 21-year-old from Mexico who studies sociology at Mt. San Antonio College in Walnut, Calif., said the new law could help him take more courses and finish sooner.\par \par \uc2 "Education is the only way to free from oppression -- this oppression we illegals live with," he said. "Education allows me to see which laws affect us and how."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writer E.J.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) - Gov. Jerry Brown on Monday signed a bill that will let students who entered the country illegally receive private financial aid at California's public colleges, even as debate continues over a more contentious bill that would allow access to public funding.\par \par \uc2 The Democratic governor signed AB130 at Los Angeles City College. It is the first of a two-bill package referred to as the California Dream Act, which is aimed at getting financial aid for college students who entered the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 "It's crucial that we invest in every child that lives and is born in this state. Signing this Dream Act is another piece of investment in people because people drives the culture, the economy," Brown told a crowd of about 100 students and community leaders who gathered inside the city college's library. "This is another piece of a very important mosaic which is a California that works for everyone."\par \par \uc2 The governor did not address the second bill in the package, which is more contentious because it would allow illegal immigrants to receive state-funded scholarships and financial aid. That bill, AB131, is in the state Senate.\par \par \uc2 The legislative package authored by state Assemblyman Gil Cedillo, D-Los Angeles, differs from the federal Dream Act, which would include a path to citizenship for those bought to the country illegally as children.\par \par \uc2 Critics of the package say granting public or private financial aid to illegal immigrants will force citizens and students who are here legally to compete with them for limited resources. Assemblyman Tim Donnelly, R-Twin Peaks, said California's public colleges and universities have already had to raise tuition fees in the face of recent budget cuts.\par \par \uc2 "Bottom line is California doesn't have enough money to take care of its obligations to its citizens right now," Donnelly said. "The people, who if they're lucky enough to have jobs, certainly would like those limited resources to go to their children or grandchildren. They certainly wouldn't want that to go to people who come here illegally."\par \par \uc2 Cedillo said he admired the students without legal status because of the obstacles they have had to overcome. He said allowing students to qualify for private scholarships and financial aid is one step that will help them get through college.\par \par \uc2 "Public education in this great state and this great country is a great equalizer of society," he said.\par \par \uc2 California's community college and public universities systems support the bill, noting that it affects less than 1 percent of their student population. According to the University of California, fewer than 80 students across its system of more than 220,000 students would be affected by the bill signed Monday.\par \par \uc2 The California State University estimated that some of the 3,600 students who have permission to pay in-state tuition rates even though they lack legal documentation could be affected by the new law. The CSU system enrolls about 440,000 students.\par \par \uc2 At least one student who stands to benefit from the California Dream Act said an education will improve his perspective and quality of life even if he'll still have trouble finding work out of college. Rigoberto Barboza, a 21-year-old from Mexico who studies sociology at Mt. San Antonio College in Walnut, Calif., said the new law could help him take more courses and finish sooner.\par \par \uc2 "Education is the only way to free from oppression -- this oppression we illegals live with," he said. "Education allows me to see which laws affect us and how."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writer E.J.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 MADRID (AP) - Several hundred Spaniards angry about their country's economic crisis protested on the outskirts of Madrid Saturday after spending about a month marching to the capital from their hometowns.\par \par \uc2 The marchers set off from Barcelona and Bilbao in the north, Valencia in the east and Cadiz in the southwest on June 25. En route, they were joined by other people angry about Spain's economic woes, including high unemployment, and what they see as their government's inept handling of the crisis.\par \par \uc2 Five columns of marchers are due to converge on downtown Sol square, adjacent to Madrid's town hall, for a large rally on Sunday.\par \par \uc2 "Every morning we were up early at 6 a.m. to respect the march's starting time," said Abdel Latif, 67, who described himself as an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Tunisia.\par \par \uc2 Several dozen demonstrators stopped outside Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero's official residence just north of Madrid to wave banners and chant slogans.\par \par \uc2 Another group halted traffic on a highway entering Madrid from the north.\par \par \uc2 On May 15, many young demonstrators began camping out at Sol, one of Madrid's busiest squares, in a protest that lasted three weeks and struck a chord with sympathizers across Spain and elsewhere in Europe where similar camps were set up.\par \par \uc2 Two years of recession have left Spain with 21 percent unemployment -- the highest in the 17-nation eurozone -- and burdened with debt. Joblessness for those aged 16 to 29 stands at about 35 percent.\par \par \uc2 During the marches to Madrid, physiotherapists traveling in support vehicles helped the protesters keep their leg muscles in shape, while sympathetic paramedics treated blistered feet, said participant Beatriz Puerta, 24.\par \par \uc2 "Many volunteers offered to act as cooks for us, preparing marvelous dishes which enabled us to keep up our strength. It's been a very positive experience," said Puerta, who hails from the northern port city of Bilbao.\par \par \uc2 Puerta said many of the young unemployed people who have marched on Madrid plan to continue on to Brussels.\par \par \uc2 "We want to arrive there in early October, to keep our cause in the public eye," she said.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110723e77n00307\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 LOS ANGELES (AP) - Jobs, education, health, housing -- the issues driving the NAACP these days look much like the concerns of most Americans, and that's by design.\par \par \uc2 As the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People kicks off its 102nd convention this weekend in downtown Los Angeles, the venerable civil rights organization's policy agenda shows how it has evolved from its decades-long role as a leading fighter against racial inequality to become a staunch advocate for social justice for all minorities.\par \par \uc2 "They're doing a much better job by being seen as lobbying for poor, disenfranchised people of all colors," said Peniel E. Joseph, a Tufts University history professor and author of a book on the civil rights and black power movements.\par \par \uc2 The strategy has enabled the NAACP to bounce back after a decade in which many charged that the organization had lost its way, becoming irrelevant.\par \par \uc2 In the 1950s and 1960s, the NAACP was a standard-bearer of the struggle for voting rights, desegregated schools, and equal access to everything from water fountains to bus seats. But by four decades later -- with a black president in the White House -- the NAACP's prominence had trickled to a place in history books.\par \par \uc2 Membership had dipped from a high of 625,000 at the NAACP's apogee in the 1964, to less than 300,000 by the mid-2000s.\par \par \uc2 Five out of seven regional headquarters had closed and an old-guard leadership appeared aloof from young people, who were mainly concerned with the dearth of economic opportunity. The organization itself was ailing, operating for five years in the red, after revenues dipped $9 million.\par \par \uc2 "There was a great sense in the 1990s that the NAACP had become a museum piece," said Earl Ofari Hutchinson, a Los Angeles-based civil rights activist and columnist. "It was missing in action."\par \par \uc2 But the organization has seen a resurgence in recent years, spearheaded by a new president, Benjamin Todd Jealous, in 2008, at age 35 the group's youngest ever.\par \par \uc2 Jealous, who had headed a foundation and worked for human rights organization Amnesty International, embarked on a major revitalization campaign by reaching out to young African-Americans and people of varied minority groups, broadening the scope of the organization to end discrimination on all fronts.\par \par \uc2 "By focusing on the nexus of great civil rights issues and human rights issues that are keeping people of color trapped in poverty, folks have responded," Jealous said, noting that the recession has resulted in a lot of shared interests among different groups. "It's much easier to get folks together to build coalitions and break barriers."\par \par \uc2 The number of members, donors and a network of online partners who promote the NAACP have surged to 525,000, with the 18 to 25-year-old group the fastest growing segment as the organization has made a point to take up issues affecting younger people, such as college affordability.\par \par \uc2 The flood of new interest has pushed the organization into the black with a $31 million budget that has been pumped up by donations from foundations and major donors -- $4 million in Jealous' first year -- as well as a doubling in the number of small donors to 20,000. By fall, it will have reopened all of the five shuttered regional offices.\par \par \uc2 "He's been very energetic," Joseph said of Jealous.\par \par \uc2 Its grassroots base, meanwhile, has been boosted by an embrace of the country's multi-ethnic tapestry. An openly gay black man, Hispanic immigrants, whites, Asians, and Native Americans now serve as chapter presidents across the nation. "As the country becomes more diverse, so does the NAACP," said Hilary Shelton, senior vice president of advocacy and policy. "We are so excited about that aspect."\par \par \uc2 The organization has taken on a menu of group-specific issues ranging from gay rights to the Dream Act, which would enable \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students to gain residency after completing college, as well as wider issues related to poverty -- joblessness, health care access, criminal justice, quality public schools -- that disenfranchised communities tend to share.\par \par \uc2 "These issues transcend race, but they're highly concentrated in poor black and Latino communities," Joseph said.\par \par \uc2 In some ways, that makes the NAACP's broader mission harder to tackle because the issues aren't as visible as overt racism, but become civil rights problems because they disproportionately affect minorities.\par \par \uc2 "Jim Crow was in your face," said Hutchinson. "It was much easier to mobilize around that. These areas are harder to put your finger on because discrimination is harder to prove."\par \par \uc2 The new stance doesn't sit well with everyone. Some charge that by expanding its playing field, the NAACP is paying short shrift to its core mission of advocating for the black community, which is beset with problems that still include police brutality and racial profiling.\par \par \uc2 "The NAACP's focus is not broad, it's specific -- it's for black people," said Boston activist Jamarhl Crawford, who publishes blackstonian.com and is a vocal critic of the new strategy. "The first job is not done. We got a lot of work to do in that regard."\par \par \uc2 Veteran NAACP members say the organization's new push actually reflects its original mission. The group was founded in 1909 by black and Jewish groups and has had white and other ethnic leaders and members in some areas of the country throughout its history.\par \par \uc2 It has always stood for equal access to jobs, housing and schools, but with different emphases over the years, noted Leon Russell, a 43-year-member who is vice chairman.\par \par \uc2 For many years, education was about ending school segregation, he said, and now it's about ensuring poor communities have access to the same quality of education as more affluent ones.\par \par \uc2 Still, when some 6,000 NAACP members gather over the next week to discuss and debate the organization's policy agenda for the upcoming year, several issues specific to the black community are priorities -- one is the plight of black men, who remained dogged by high rates of incarceration, murder and unemployment.\par \par \uc2 Jealous said the organization is working to reconcile disparate sentencing laws, such as harsher terms for crack cocaine offenses, which is more prevalent in the black community, compared to powder cocaine.\par \par \uc2 A shorter-term issue is ensuring African-American voter rights for the 2012 presidential election. A number of states have passed restrictive voting laws that activists say will disenfranchise swaths of black voters, such as requirements to present a photo ID at the polling booth.\par \par \uc2 Although NAACP's historic battles are over, Jealous said the organization remains more relevant than ever with an increasingly divisive political climate and growing poverty. "This is a very tense time in our nation's history," he said.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Contact the reporter at http:twitter.com/ChristinaHoag\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110722e77m001sa\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SEATTLE (AP) - Washington state has canceled the driver's license of a Pulitzer Prize winning journalist who attracted national attention with his disclosure that he is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Department of Licensing spokeswoman Christine Anthony said Thursday that officials opened an investigation after Jose Antonio Vargas' essay about his background was published in the \uc2 New York Times Magazine\uc2  in June.\par \par \uc2 Vargas wrote in his essay that he emigrated from the Philippines in 1993 when he was 12 years old at the wish of his mother. He moved to California, where his grandparents had arranged forged documents for him. When he was 16, Vargas wrote, he found out that he was in the country illegally after he tried to obtain a driver's permit with those documents.\par \par \uc2 He said that he obtained a driver's license in Washington earlier this year after his Oregon license expired.\par \par \uc2 "We conducted in an investigation and concluded that he wasn't residing at the address he provided us," Anthony said.\par \par \uc2 The Licensing Department sent Vargas a letter requesting proof of residency, and the letter was returned. The state canceled his license July 18.\par \par \uc2 In his essay, Vargas wrote about worrying that his Oregon license would expire when he turned 30.\par \par \uc2 "Early this year, just two weeks before my 30th birthday, I won a small reprieve: I obtained a driver's license in the state of Washington. The license is valid until 2016. This offered me five more years of acceptable identification -- but also five more years of fear, of lying to people I respect and institutions that trusted me, of running away from who I am," Vargas wrote.\par \par \uc2 Because Vargas didn't surrender his license, he will still have a card that he presumably can still use to board an airplane or obtain other services that require ID. But if authorities run a background check, for example if Vargas gets pulled over while driving, it will show that the license is not valid, Anthony said.\par \par \uc2 The Seattle Times first reported the Licensing Department's action Thursday.\par \par \uc2 Vargas was part of the Washington Post team that won the Pulitzer Prize in 2008 for coverage of the Virginia Tech massacre. He had also interned for The San Francisco Chronicle and the Philadelphia Daily News, and most recently was a senior contributing editor at Huffington Post.\par \par \uc2 His coming out as an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  attracted national attention and put a spotlight on what his former employers knew of his legal status. A Washington Post spokesman called Vargas' actions "wrong."\par \par \uc2 But he wrote that he's tired of hiding his secret and has launched a campaign called Define American to use stories of immigrants like him to urge Congress and the Obama administration to pursue immigration reform. His high school principal and superintendent have signed on as board members.\par \par \uc2 Vargas did not respond to an email sent by The Associated Press. A spokesman pointed to a blog post on Vargas' campaign website in which he said he learned Wednesday that his license had been revoked and it was a reminder of the "collective struggle" immigrants like him face.\par \par \uc2 "It's not unexpected, given how I laid out in detail how I've been able to live, work and survive as an undocumented immigrant in our country," he said. "Still, it's a sad feeling.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) - Huge increases in deportations of people after they were arrested for breaking traffic or immigration laws or driving drunk helped the Obama administration set a record last year for the number of criminal immigrants forced to leave the country, documents show.\par \par \uc2 The U.S. deported nearly 393,000 people in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, half of whom were considered criminals. Of those, 27,635 had been arrested for drunken driving, more than double the 10,851 deported after drunken driving arrests in 2008, the last full year of the Bush administration, according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement data provided to The Associated Press.\par \par \uc2 An additional 13,028 were deported last year after being arrested on less serious traffic law violations, nearly three times the 4,527 traffic offenders deported two years earlier, according to the data.\par \par \uc2 The spike in the numbers of people deported for traffic offenses as well as a 78 percent increase in people deported for immigration-related offenses renewed skepticism about the administration's claims that it is focusing on the most dangerous criminals.\par \par \uc2 President Barack Obama regularly says his administration is enforcing immigration laws more wisely than his predecessor by focusing on arresting the "worst of the worst." He promised in his 2008 presidential campaign to focus immigration enforcement on dangerous criminals. As recently as May 10, Obama said in a speech in El Paso, Texas, that his administration was focused on violent offenders and not families or "folks who are looking to scrape together an income."\par \par \uc2 Most of the criminal immigrants deported last year had committed drug-related crimes. They totaled 45,003, compared with 36,053 in 2008. Drug-related crime -- described as the manufacture, distribution, possession or sale of drugs -- has been the No. 1 crime among immigration for years. Drunken driving had the third highest total number of immigrants deported with that crime.\par \par \uc2 An \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Bolivia, Carlos Montano, is awaiting trial in Virginia on charges of involuntary manslaughter in a drunken driving accident that killed Benedictine nun Denise Mosier and injured two other nuns. The case fueled national debate over deportations of criminal immigrants because Montano had two previous drunken driving arrests, in 2007 and 2008. He was not held by ICE or deported after the arrests. An ICE report concluded that new federal immigration policies would have prevented Montano's release.\par \par \uc2 But the rise in traffic offenders in the deportation statistics and in some other categories worries immigration advocates, particularly because traffic stops are largely made by police, sheriff's deputies and state highway patrol officers. Local law enforcement has become more involved in immigration enforcement because of new programs that encourage it.\par \par \uc2 Officers "are using their new authority to remove as many unauthorized people from their jurisdictions as they can, and that frequently means going after traffic violators instead of serious criminals," said Muzaffar Chishti, director of the Migration Policy Institute's office at New York University Law School. The institute is a Washington-based think tank on migration.\par \par \uc2 Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano noted that most people in the United States are arrested for misdemeanor offenses. But she told the AP that the percentage of felons deported will change over time.\par \par \uc2 "The more serious offenders are still in prison," she said in an interview Thursday. "We're not going to see them reflected in the numbers until we can begin to remove them."\par \par \uc2 The issue is one Obama is trying to carefully navigate in his bid for a second term as he relies on the record deportations numbers to bolster his tough-on-enforcement stance while trying to convince immigrant and Latino voters he deserves more time to get a comprehensive immigration bill through Congress.\par \par \uc2 Marshall Fitz, immigration policy director at the liberal Center for American Progress think tank, said some of the people being counted as criminals have committed traffic violations that would usually draw a traffic ticket. But when the driver can't produce a valid license, the officer pursues questions about immigration status.\par \par \uc2 Illegal immigrants caught in traffic stops often are pressured into signing an agreement to leave the United States and to pay a fine or somehow acknowledge responsibility for the traffic offense and thereby end up in the statistics as criminals even though they never went to court, Fitz said.\par \par \uc2 Kumar Kibble, Immigration and Customs Enforcement deputy of immigration, said in some cases people picked up on traffic offenses are found to have committed other crimes. But ICE attempts to categorize each deported immigrant in its statistics based on the worst crime in the person's record. ICE says the statistics involve only people who have been convicted of a crime.\par \par \uc2 Darrel Stephens, executive director of Major Cities Chiefs Association, an organization of sheriffs and police chiefs, said the data show ICE is deporting criminals. He noted that even though traffic offenses have more than doubled, they are just 7 percent of the total criminal deportations. Meanwhile, dangerous drugs and drunken driving deportations comprised 23 percent and 14 percent of the criminal deportations, respectively.\par \par \uc2 The drunken driving deportations are particularly important, he said. Fatal drunken driving accidents involving illegal immigrants often cause outrage in communities where they occur.\par \par \uc2 "That's a crime that people look at in a very serious way right now," Stephens said.\par \par \uc2 There are an estimated 11 million people in the country illegally, 7 million to 8 million of whom are believed to be adults.\par \par \uc2 Kibble said the numbers show his agency's system of giving priority for deportation to people who pose a public threat is working. Last year, 36,178 criminals were deported as a result of the Secure Communities program, now in place in more than 1,400 jurisdictions, up from 14 in 2008. It's expected to be in more than 3,000 jurisdictions nationally by 2013.\par \par \uc2 Secure Communities is the Homeland Security Department's system of identifying immigrants for deportation through fingerprints taken by local officers when booking people on criminal charges. The local law enforcement agencies routinely send the prints to the FBI for criminal background checks. The FBI shares the fingerprints with Homeland Security to look for potentially deportable immigrants, who can be in the country illegally or legally.\par \par \uc2 "The numbers are going in the right direction," Kibble said.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Online:\par \par \uc2 Immigration and Customs Enforcement: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.ice.gov"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.ice.gov}}}\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Reach Suzanne Gamboa at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.twitter.com/APsgamboa"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.twitter.com/APsgamboa}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110722e77m001py\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SEATTLE (AP) - Washington state has canceled the driver's license of a Pulitzer Prize winning journalist who publicly said he is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Officials opened an investigation after Jose Antonio Vargas' essay about his background was published in the \uc2 New York Times Magazine\uc2  in June, Department of Licensing spokeswoman Christine Anthony said Thursday.\par \par \uc2 Vargas wrote in the essay that he obtained a driver's license in Washington earlier this year after his Oregon license expired.\par \par \uc2 "We conducted in an investigation and concluded that he wasn't residing at the address he provided us," Anthony said.\par \par \uc2 The Licensing Department sent Vargas a letter requesting proof of residency, and the letter was returned. The state canceled his license July 18.\par \par \uc2 In his essay, Vargas wrote about worrying that his Oregon license would expire when he turned 30.\par \par \uc2 "Early this year, just two weeks before my 30th birthday, I won a small reprieve: I obtained a driver's license in the state of Washington. The license is valid until 2016. This offered me five more years of acceptable identification -- but also five more years of fear, of lying to people I respect and institutions that trusted me, of running away from who I am," Vargas wrote.\par \par \uc2 Because Vargas didn't surrender his license, he will still have a card that he presumably can still use to board an airplane or obtain other services that require ID. But if authorities run a background check, for example if Vargas gets pulled over while driving, it will show that the license is not valid, Anthony said.\par \par \uc2 The Seattle Times first reported the Licensing Department's action Thursday.\par \par \uc2 Vargas wrote in his essay that he emigrated from the Philippines in 1993 when he was 12 years old at the wish of his mother. He moved to California, where his grandparents had arranged forged documents for him. When he was 16, Vargas wrote, he found out that he was in the country illegally after he tried to obtain a driver's permit with those documents.\par \par \uc2 Vargas was part of the Washington Post team that won the Pulitzer Prize in 2008 for coverage of the Virginia Tech massacre. He had also interned for The San Francisco Chronicle and the Philadelphia Daily News, and most recently was a senior contributing editor at Huffington Post.\par \par \uc2 His coming out as an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  attracted national attention and put a spotlight on what his former employers knew of his legal status. A Washington Post spokesman called Vargas' actions "wrong."\par \par \uc2 But he wrote that he's tired of hiding his secret and has launched a campaign called Define American to use stories of immigrants like him to urge Congress and the Obama administration to pursue immigration reform. His high school principal and superintendent have signed on as board members.\par \par \uc2 Email messages to Vargas and his representatives were not immediately returned. But in a blog post on his campaign's website, Vargas said he learned Wednesday that his license had been revoked and said it was a reminder of the "collective struggle" immigrants like him face.\par \par \uc2 "It's not unexpected, given how I laid out in detail how I've been able to live, work and survive as an undocumented immigrant in our country," he said. "Still, it's a sad feeling. In some ways, my driver's license has been my life line."\par \par \uc2 He continued, "However, I believe it is a small price to pay relative to the big things we're going to do, together."\par \par \uc2 Washington and New Mexico are the two states that don't require driver's license applicants to furnish a Social Security number.\par \par \uc2 Washington's Department of Licensing said last week that fewer out-of-state people who didn't provide a Social Security number have sought to obtain a driver's license in the state. The recent data suggest stricter rules Washington implemented in the past year are deterring illegal immigrants from getting licenses.\par \par \uc2 The new rules no longer allow cellphone or cable bills as proof of residency, but the state still accepts identification from other countries among the documents required in lieu of a Social Security number.\par \par \uc2 The department's data show that in the first half of 2011, 5,346 people didn't provide a Social Security number when obtaining a license. In all of 2010, more than 23,000 did not.\par \par \uc2 Other data show that the department has canceled 372 licenses due to fraud in 2011. A total of 717 were canceled in 2010.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writer Mike Baker in Olympia, Wash., contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 5\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110721e77l002s1\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) - A coalition of civil rights groups asked a federal judge Thursday to block Alabama's tough new illegal immigration from taking effect Sept. 1.\par \par \uc2 The request was filed in federal court in Huntsville by the same groups that have already sued over the law, which opponents and supporters say is the toughest of its kind in the nation.\par \par \uc2 Federal courts have blocked all or parts of similar laws passed in four other states. Alabama's law allows police to detain people they suspect of being illegal immigrants after a traffic stop, requires schools to report the immigration status of students, and makes it illegal to knowingly transport or give shelter to an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The motion filed Thursday by the American Civil Liberties Union, the Southern Poverty Law Center and other civil rights groups calls the law blatantly unconstitutional and asks a judge to stop it before it harms Alabama residents. An attorney for the Southern Poverty Law Center, Sam Brooke, said the motion seeks to stop the law from taking effect until the courts have issued a final ruling on the lawsuit.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange has filed a motion claiming the original lawsuit is vague, repetitive and does not give a legal reason for why the new law should be thrown out. Strange's motion asks U.S. District Judge Sharon Blackburn to order the plaintiffs to rewrite the original lawsuit and provide a clearer explanation of what's wrong with the law.\par \par \uc2 Strange's motion challenges one statement in the original lawsuit that compared the new immigration law to "the worst aspects of Alabama's history," referring to the state's segregationist past. Strange's motion calls that language "impertinent and scandalous" and asks that it be removed from the lawsuit.\par \par \uc2 Republican House Speaker Mike Hubbard said the lawsuit would not undo the immigration law and Alabama would not become a sanctuary state for illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 "If the court finds problems with parts of the law, tweaks can be made," Hubbard said. "Alabama will have a strict immigration law, and we will enforce it."\par \par \uc2 Supporters of the new law have argued that it only involves the activities of illegal immigrants and that anyone who is in the country legally or who is a U.S. citizen should not be concerned.\par \par \uc2 But Brooke said the new law involves average Alabama citizens in immigration decisions by making it illegal for them to enter into a contract or even give a ride to the store to an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "You as a private citizen have no way of knowing what the immigration status is of a person," Brooke said.\par \par \uc2 The lawsuit claims that it's the federal government's duty to enforce immigration law and that Alabama's law encroaches on that authority.\par \par \uc2 But Senate president pro tem Republican Sen. Del Marsh of Anniston said Alabama officials have tired of waiting for the federal government to act.\par \par \uc2 "While the federal government has looked the other way on this issue, Alabama's \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  population has exploded nearly 400 percent over the last decade," Marsh said. With Alabama's unemployment rate over 9 percent, Marsh said it's important to make sure state residents aren't being passed over for jobs in favor of those who are here illegally.\par \par \uc2 State Rep. Micky Hammon, R-Decatur, House sponsor of the bill, said it is already having the effect supporters had hoped by forcing immigrants in the country illegally to leave the state.\par \par \uc2 "These far-left, liberal groups have filed an injunction because those who live here illegally and break our laws with their simple presence are packing up and leaving Alabama. That was the intent of the bill in the first place - to protect our borders and our jobs," Hammon said.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110721e77l00283\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

(AP) - Seven \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students arrested in a Southern California street protest are now waiting to see whether they will be deported in a test of the Obama administration's immigration policy, students said Thursday.\par \par \uc2 The students were questioned by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials after they were arrested Tuesday for blocking street traffic during a street protest in San Bernardino, said Jonathan Perez, a 24-year-old communications student who was detained.\par \par \uc2 Perez, who will attend Pasadena City College this fall, said the students intentionally blocked the street in the hopes of getting arrested to prove that law enforcement agencies in San Bernardino are collaborating with immigration authorities -- and that students get no special treatment.\par \par \uc2 "We wanted to ... show that once we're in prison that ICE does get involved with undocumented youth, although Obama says they don't," said Perez, who came to the country from Colombia when he was 3.\par \par \uc2 Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials chose not to detain the students after questioning them but are still investigating, the agency said in a statement. ICE spokeswoman Lori Haley declined to state whether the students would be put into deportation proceedings.\par \par \uc2 The protest comes as the Obama administration has made clear that \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students who were brought here as children are not a priority for deportation. Even so, students say some continue to be deported and have led similar demonstrations elsewhere in the country against stringent immigration laws and in an effort to push for a bill to grant them legal status.\par \par \uc2 Illegal immigrant\uc2  student groups planned the demonstration for San Bernardino Valley College, where they say campus police have turned over students to local law enforcement agencies that collaborate with federal immigration authorities. At least one student detained by campus police in the past is now in deportation proceedings, said Javier Hernandez, a protest organizer and member of the Inland Empire Dream Team, an organization of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  college students in the suburbs east of Los Angeles.\par \par \uc2 On Tuesday, students gathered at the campus to hear the seven students "come out" and reveal their immigration status. The group then led a march through the campus and later blocked a nearby street until police told them to leave, Hernandez said.\par \par \uc2 The seven students who refused to budge were arrested by San Bernardino police, held for 12 hours and are being charged with unlawful assembly and failure to disperse, he said.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110714e77e002pq\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc74}{\*\bkmkend toc74}\b \uc2 Some Alabama churches that sat out civil rights lead opposition to \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  crackdown\b0\par\par\uc2 By JAY REEVES   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 1,302 \uc2 words\par \uc2 13 July 2011\par 21:00\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2011.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) - For some believers and church leaders, opposing Alabama's toughest-in-the-nation law against illegal immigration is a chance for Bible Belt redemption.\par \par \uc2 During the civil rights movement of the 1950s and '60s, many state churches didn't join the fight to end Jim Crow laws and racial segregation. Some cross-burning Ku Klux Klan members took off their hoods and sat in the pews with everyone else on Sunday mornings, and relatively few white congregations actively opposed segregation. Some black churches were hesitant to get involved for fear of white backlash.\par \par \uc2 Now that Alabama has passed what's widely considered the nation's most restrictive state law against illegal immigration, mainstream churches, faith-based organizations and individual members are leading opposition to the act. Some see their involvement as a way to avoid repeating mistakes of the past.\par \par \uc2 "I think what happened in the `60s may be a stimulus for the action that you have seen many of the churches taking on this," said Chriss H. Doss, an attorney and ordained Southern Baptist minister.\par \par \uc2 Matt Lacey, pastor of a United Methodist church once attended by Birmingham's infamous segregationist police commissioner Eugene "Bull" Connor, said there are all sorts of reasons Alabama Christians are opposed to the law. Making amends for the past inaction of religious groups is among them, he said.\par \par \uc2 "For me, as pastor of a church that was engaged in that battle, it is very important," said Lacey. "If we take redemption very seriously, then it not only covers our sins but our past actions as a church. I think for some, there is a tendency to want to be on the side of right on this issue. ... I would like to think the church just wants to do what's right."\par \par \uc2 At 56, the Rev. Al Garrett is old enough to recall some faith communities sitting on the sidelines during the civil rights movement. Garrett, who helped organize a prayer rally that drew a few hundred people Sunday night in Huntsville, said the difference now is uplifting.\par \par \uc2 "I've thanked God that I've been here to see the way people of faith are taking a stand on this," he said.\par \par \uc2 After a prayer for wisdom, members of the Birmingham City Council recently passed a unanimous resolution calling for the repeal of the law. That same day, ministers and lay people gathered to discuss opposition to the law in the same church where, more than 50 years ago, white segregationists gathered to form a group to oppose white and black children going to school together.\par \par \uc2 Urged to come to a rally and candlelight march sponsored by churches and faith-based groups, a diverse crowd estimated around 2,000 marched quietly through downtown streets on a recent Saturday night near where police dogs snapped at black demonstrators two generations ago.\par \par \uc2 An interfaith prayer walk planned for July 30 in Montgomery will pass Martin Luther King Jr.'s first church on the way to the steps of Alabama's Capitol. And more than 100 United Methodist ministers -- many of them moderate to liberal, but some also on the conservative side -- signed an open letter to the governor criticizing the law.\par \par \uc2 Believers are doing more than praying and protesting. The ecumenical Greater Birmingham Ministries, along with two ministers and a Montgomery-area church member who works with Hispanics, were among the groups and individuals who filed a federal lawsuit last week attempting to have the law declared unconstitutional.\par \par \uc2 Doss is struck by the differences between 2011 and 1963, when the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. wrote his "Letter from a Birmingham Jail" to seven white moderate ministers and a rabbi who were publicly urging him to go slower with the campaign to end legalized segregation. Many black churches also were slow initially to embrace the cause of civil rights in Birmingham, where Klan night riders roamed with bombs for years.\par \par \uc2 "There were a number of black ministers who took a more conservative position that they were not going to get involved publicly. Their involvement greatly increased through the years," said Wayne Coleman, head of archives at the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute.\par \par \uc2 Churches had little to say about the bill as it moved through the Alabama Legislature, but that could be because they were overwhelmed for weeks providing food and other assistance to victims of the deadly tornadoes that swept across the state on April 27, killing more than 240 people.\par \par \uc2 In contrast, denominational leaders were outspoken at the Georgia General Assembly as a similarly tough law moved toward final passage in Atlanta. Religious leaders have been less vocal in Georgia since legislators passed the law, but a federal judge blocked key provisions of that act this week.\par \par \uc2 Now in Alabama, leaders among the state's fast-growing Hispanic community hope the involvement of churches will help lead to a repeal of the law, signed earlier this month by Republican Gov. Robert Bentley, a Southern Baptist deacon and Sunday school teacher.\par \par \uc2 "It's huge to have the faith community come together and speak out in such great numbers against this new law," said Isabel Rubio, executive director of the Hispanic Interest Coalition of Alabama. "Because we're in the middle of the Bible Belt, we certainly expect that the faith communities' influence ... will land on folks' ears who are willing to listen."\par \par \uc2 Religious opposition to the new law -- which has included not just Christian churches but Jewish and Muslim congregations -- is two-fold.\par \par \uc2 Some Christians see the issue in faith terms when they compare biblical instructions to welcome strangers and love others with the law's ban on helping illegal immigrants secure a place to live, a job, health care other than for emergencies and even a ride to the store. Under the law, police can check anyone's immigration status during a traffic stop or other encounter and jail people without bond if they don't have proper documents.\par \par \uc2 Fernando del Castillo, pastor of a Spanish-speaking congregation of about 300 people in metro Birmingham, is particularly worried about a provision requiring that schools check the immigration status of students and report the information to the state. He fears some immigrant parents will be afraid to send their children to school when classes resume in August.\par \par \uc2 "Will they keep them at home? I don't know," del Castillo said.\par \par \uc2 Others are worried the law could criminalize mission work with illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 "They wonder if this is the beginning of infringing on freedoms that the church has considered its bailiwick," Doss said.\par \par \uc2 Leaders of the United Methodist Church, the Episcopal Church, the Lutheran Church and the Roman Catholic Church all have criticized the law as running counter to biblical teachings about caring for neighbors, helping visitors and showing hospitality to strangers.\par \par \uc2 The state's largest denomination, the Alabama Baptist Convention, hasn't taken a position publicly and likely won't since it doesn't speak for individual churches. Convention president Mike Shaw, pastor of a church in suburban Birmingham, said the law "is the toughest in the nation and personally I think all laws need to be enforced."\par \par \uc2 "I am concerned about the language concerning giving a ride in an automobile to an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  or allowing children of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  parents to ride on a church bus to Sunday school, vacation Bible school, or church camp," he said in a statement. "Should we ignore people who are injured or have broken down on the side of a busy interstate highway and have small children in sweltering heat with no family or friends to help them?"\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press Writer Kate Brumback in Atlanta contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110714e77e00060\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc75}{\*\bkmkend toc75}\b \uc2 Some Alabama churches that sat out civil rights lead opposition to \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  crackdown\b0\par\par\uc2 By JAY REEVES   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 1,300 \uc2 words\par \uc2 13 July 2011\par 19:23\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2011.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) - For some believers and church leaders, opposing Alabama's toughest-in-the-nation law against illegal immigration is a chance for Bible Belt redemption.\par \par \uc2 During the civil rights movement of the 1950s and '60s, many state churches didn't join the fight to end Jim Crow laws and racial segregation. Some cross-burning Ku Klux Klan members took off their hoods and sat in the pews with everyone else on Sunday mornings, and relatively few white congregations actively opposed segregation. Some black churches were hesitant to get involved for fear of white backlash.\par \par \uc2 Now that Alabama has passed what's widely considered the nation's most restrictive state law against illegal immigration, mainstream churches, faith-based organizations and individual members are leading opposition to the act. Some see their involvement as a way to avoid repeating mistakes of the past.\par \par \uc2 "I think what happened in the `60s may be a stimulus for the action that you have seen many of the churches taking on this," said Chriss H. Doss, an attorney and ordained Southern Baptist minister.\par \par \uc2 Matt Lacey, pastor of a United Methodist church once attended by Birmingham's infamous segregationist police commissioner Eugene "Bull" Connor, said there are all sorts of reasons Alabama Christians are opposed to the law. Making amends for the past inaction of religious groups is among them, he said.\par \par \uc2 "For me, as pastor of a church that was engaged in that battle, it is very important," said Lacey. "If we take redemption very seriously, then it not only covers our sins but our past actions as a church. I think for some, there is a tendency to want to be on the side of right on this issue. ... I would like to think the church just wants to do what's right."\par \par \uc2 At 56, the Rev. Al Garrett is old enough to recall some faith communities sitting on the sidelines during the civil rights movement. Garrett, who helped organize a prayer rally that drew a few hundred people Sunday night in Huntsville, said the difference now is uplifting.\par \par \uc2 "I've thanked God that I've been here to see the way people of faith are taking a stand on this," he said.\par \par \uc2 After a prayer for wisdom, members of the Birmingham City Council recently passed a unanimous resolution calling for the repeal of the law. That same day, ministers and lay people gathered to discuss opposition to the law in the same church where, more than 50 years ago, white segregationists gathered to form a group to oppose white and black children going to school together.\par \par \uc2 Urged to come to a rally and candlelight march sponsored by churches and faith-based groups, a diverse crowd estimated around 2,000 marched quietly through downtown streets on a recent Saturday night near where police dogs snapped at black demonstrators two generations ago.\par \par \uc2 An interfaith prayer walk planned for July 30 in Montgomery will pass Martin Luther King Jr.'s first church on the way to the steps of Alabama's Capitol. And more than 100 United Methodist ministers -- many of them moderate to liberal, but some also on the conservative side -- signed an open letter to the governor criticizing the law.\par \par \uc2 Believers are doing more than praying and protesting. The ecumenical Greater Birmingham Ministries, a Montgomery-area church member who works with Hispanics and two ministers were among the groups and individuals who filed a federal lawsuit last week attempting to have the law declared unconstitutional.\par \par \uc2 Doss is struck by the differences between 2011 and 1963, when the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. wrote his "Letter from a Birmingham Jail" to seven white moderate ministers and a rabbi who were publicly urging him to go slower with the campaign to end legalized segregation. Many black churches also were slow initially to embrace the cause of civil rights in Birmingham, where Klan night riders roamed with bombs for years.\par \par \uc2 "There were a number of black ministers who took a more conservative position that they were not going to get involved publicly. Their involvement greatly increased through the years," said Wayne Coleman, head of archives at the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute.\par \par \uc2 Churches had little to say about the bill as it moved through the Alabama Legislature, but that could be because they were overwhelmed for weeks providing food and other assistance to victims of the deadly tornadoes that swept across the state on April 27, killing more than 240 people.\par \par \uc2 In contrast, denominational leaders were outspoken at the Georgia General Assembly as a similarly tough law moved toward final passage in Atlanta. Religious leaders have been less vocal in Georgia since legislators passed the law, but a federal judge blocked key provisions of that act this week.\par \par \uc2 Now in Alabama, leaders among the state's fast-growing Hispanic community hope the involvement of churches will help lead to a repeal of the law, signed earlier this month by Republican Gov. Robert Bentley, a Southern Baptist deacon and Sunday school teacher.\par \par \uc2 "It's huge to have the faith community come together and speak out in such great numbers against this new law," said Isabel Rubio, executive director of the Hispanic Interest Coalition of Alabama. "Because we're in the middle of the Bible Belt, we certainly expect that the faith communities' influence ... will land on folks' ears who are willing to listen."\par \par \uc2 Religious opposition to the new law -- which has included not just Christian churches but Jewish and Muslim congregations -- is two-fold.\par \par \uc2 Some Christians see the issue in faith terms when they compare biblical instructions to welcome strangers and love others with the law's ban on helping illegal immigrants secure a place to live, a job, health care other than for emergencies and even a ride to the store. Under the law, police can check anyone's immigration status during a traffic stop or other encounter and jail people without bond if they don't have proper documents.\par \par \uc2 Fernando del Castillo, pastor of a Spanish-speaking congregation of about 300 people in metro Birmingham, is particularly worried about a provision requiring that schools check the immigration status of students and report the information to the state. He fears some immigrant parents will be afraid to send their children to school when classes resume in August.\par \par \uc2 "Will they keep them at home? I don't know," del Castillo said.\par \par \uc2 Others are worried the law could criminalize mission work with illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 "They wonder if this is the beginning of infringing on freedoms that the church has considered its bailiwick," Doss said.\par \par \uc2 Leaders of the United Methodist Church, the Episcopal Church, the Lutheran Church and the Roman Catholic Church all have criticized the law as running counter to biblical teachings about caring for neighbors, helping visitors and showing hospitality to strangers.\par \par \uc2 The state's largest denomination, the Alabama Baptist Convention, hasn't taken a position publicly and likely won't since it doesn't speak for individual churches. Convention president Mike Shaw, pastor of a church in suburban Birmingham, said the law "is the toughest in the nation and personally I think all laws need to be enforced."\par \par \uc2 "I am concerned about the language concerning giving a ride in an automobile to an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  or allowing children of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  parents to ride on a church bus to Sunday school, vacation Bible school, or church camp," he said in a statement. "Should we ignore people who are injured or have broken down on the side of a busy interstate highway and have small children in sweltering heat with no family or friends to help them?"\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press Writer Kate Brumback in Atlanta contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110713e77d002bo\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

(AP) - More than a dozen suspected illegal immigrants were captured early Tuesday on a Southern California beach after a smuggling boat capsized in rough surf.\par \par \uc2 The boat was spotted landing at Crystal Cove State Park in Orange County at 5 a.m. Tuesday, said Virginia Kice, spokeswoman for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\par \par \uc2 The boat capsized but all 15 adults aboard made it to the beach.\par \par \uc2 Federal agents captured 14 -- one of whom was found hiding in brush -- while one other escaped, Kice said. Of the 14, 11 are men and three are women.\par \par \uc2 They are being questioned to determine what role, if any, they had in planning the smuggling operation.\par \par \uc2 The capture follows the weekend rescue of 15 suspected illegal immigrants stranded on Santa Cruz Island in the Channel Islands northwest of Los Angeles. Ten others were detained in the Malibu area last month.\par \par \uc2 Authorities say smugglers have been turning to sea routes from Mexico into the U.S. because of increased enforcement on land.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110712e77c002ro\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

But rally organizer Al Garrett says he's glad to see faith groups leading opposition to the law.\par \par \uc2 Supporters of the law say it's needed to limit the number of illegal immigrants living in Alabama.

"It's definitely in the back of your mind. You think about it, and then you get down, and then you just try to forget about it and it's not easy. It's something I'm going to have to get through, me and my family are going to have to get through and the Stones are going to have to get through."\par \par \uc2 Miller is a 20-year-old right-hander for Double-A Springfield, Mo., in the St. Louis Cardinals organization, has a fastball in the high 90s. St. Louis made him the 19th pick overall in the 2009 draft. He is 5-4 in 14 starts for Springfield with a 2.44 ERA, with 114 strikeouts and 28 walks.\par \par \uc2 Miller pitched a scoreless inning on Sunday, allowing one hit, striking out one and walking one. He said his parents were with the Stones family on Sunday but taped the game and planned to watch it later.\par \par \uc2 He remembered Stone as a great person and a great father to the 6-year-old boy who watched his dad fall to his death.\par \par \uc2 "We'll get through it," Miller said, "but right now it's pretty tough."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 HARPER'S TOUGH DAY: Bryce Harper's first appearance on a big stage was a bit unnerving for the No. 1 pick in the 2010 draft. The 18-year-old outfielder was miked for the All-Star Futures game on Sunday by ESPN and could be heard in warmups marveling at how many pitchers on the World squad who could top 100 mph.\par \par \uc2 Harper went on to go hitless in four at-bats with two strikeouts.,\par \par \uc2 "I was just trying to get after that fastball," he said. "If I swung through a changeup or a curveball and looked stupid, that is what happens. I was just trying to get a fastball and got it a couple of times, hit it. It looked really good off the bat, but ... "\par \par \uc2 The Washington Nationals promoted Harper to Double-A Harrisburg last Monday after he hit .318 at Class A Hagerstown with 14 home runs and 46 RBIs. He knows there could be another futures game in his future.\par \par \uc2 "Hopefully I will be invited back here," he said. "I am having a lot of fun -- a blast."\par \par \uc2 ----\par \par \uc2 TWEETING WITH THE STARS: Want to let Jose Bautista or David Ortiz know how you felt about that blast they hit into the Chase Field seats in the Home Run Derby? Just tweet him.\par \par \uc2 The Toronto Blue Jays and Boston Red Sox sluggers are among a handful of players who have agreed to communicate with fans via Twitter from the field at Monday night's festivities.\par \par \uc2 Others taking part include Heath Bell, Gio Gonzalez, Joel Hanrahan, Matt Kemp, Howie Kendrick, Hunter Pence, Brandon Phillips, Gaby Sanchez, Justin Upton, Shane Victorino and C.J. Wilson.\par \par \uc2 Bautista, Ortiz and Kemp are Home Run Derby participants. The others are schedule to play in Tuesday's All-Star game, with the exception of Victorino, who has withdrawn due to injury.\par \par \uc2 The MLB says other players on hand Monday night will have the opportunity to provide live commentary, photos and video through the Twitter and \uc2 Facebook\uc2  accounts of Major League Baseball and the Major League Baseball Players Association.\par \par \uc2 The players' Twitter accounts are as follows: Bautista (at)JoeyBats19, Ortiz (at)davidortiz, Bell (at)HeathBell21, Gonzalez (at)GioGonzalez47, Joel Hanrahan (at)hanrahan4457, Kemp (at)TheRealMattKemp, Kendrick (at)HKendrick47, Pence (at)HunterPence9, Phillips (at)DatDudeBP, Sanchez (at)GabySanchez15, Upton (at)RealJustinUpton, Victorino (at)ShaneVictorino and Wilson (at)str8edgeracer.\par \par \uc2 On Twitter, the league's account is (at)MLB and the players association (at)MLB--PLAYERS. Their \uc2 Facebook\uc2  accounts are \uc2 Facebook.com\uc2 /MLB and \uc2 Facebook.com\uc2 /MLBPlayers Assoc.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 CHAIN GANG: Maricopa County's Joe Arpaio, the self-proclaimed "toughest sheriff" in America, plans to deploy a chain gang to pick up litter outside Chase Field at the All-Star game.\par \par \uc2 The inmates, who are clad in cartoon-like striped jail outfits, include some from the holding tank for illegal immigrants, all of whom have been convicted of driving under the influence. The group also will include other DUI offenders.\par \par \uc2 Arpaio said the idea is to show the perils of drunken driving in Arizona, which has among the nation's toughest DUI laws. Asked why illegal immigrants are included in the chain gang, he said, "I would be discriminating against the people here illegally in this country who have been convicted of the same crimes U.S. citizens have been convicted of. Should I say, 'Oh, no, you can't be on a chain gang because you're from a different country?'"\par \par \uc2 The sheriff's office, known for its anti-\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  sweeps of neighborhoods and businesses, said all chain gang participants volunteered for the duty rather than remain in "Tent City," jail homes, which have no air conditioning.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 GOLDEN HOMERS: A few of the balls used in Monday's home run derby will have a little something extra for the fans who catch them: gold.\par \par \uc2 The special balls will be made with one panel that's infused with 24-carat gold leather and will be used once a batter is down to his final out in each round of the derby.\par \par \uc2 The balls have a retail value of $149.99, so anyone who manages to snag one at Chase Field will get a little extra value for their effort. Major League Baseball, along with \uc2 State Farm Insurance\uc2 , also will donate a combined $18,000 to the Boys and Girls Clubs of America for each golden ball that goes out for a homer.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 BERNIE PLAYS: Former New York Yankees outfielder Bernie Williams played the national anthem on his guitar before Sunday's Futures Game.\par \par \uc2 Williams won four World Series titles and four Gold Gloves in 16 years with the Yankees and was an accomplished musician even during his playing days. He released his first album in 2003 and put out another in 2009 that was nominated for a Latin Grammy.\par \par \uc2 Williams, who last played in the majors in 2006, played a flawless rendition of the national anthem on Sunday, receiving a warm ovation.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 COOLING TREND: While dashing from hotels to taxis to the enclosed air conditioned comfort of Chase Field, the All-Star experience for fans is a scorching one, but perhaps not as bad as had been forecast.\par \par \uc2 The temperature cooled to 102 degrees on Sunday afternoon and, thanks to the threat of thunderstorms, might not even reach triple digits on Monday. The forecast high for Tuesday, the date of the All-Star game, is a mere 101. The average high for this time of year is 107.\par \par \uc2 On July 2, the high in Phoenix hit an incredible 118, a record for that date. That was a dry heat, but then so is a blow torch. Then came the massive dust storm that sent a wall of dirt through the city, a spectacle widely displayed on video across the country.\par \par \uc2 The lower temperatures bring higher humidity, and still-miserable conditions. Paramedic units were deployed around the ballpark and the nearby FanFest to provide aid for anyone overcome by the heat.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 CELEBRITY SOFTBALL: Former Arizona Diamondbacks All-Star Luis Gonzalez had quite an All-Star Sunday.\par \par \uc2 He started off the day managing the World Team in the Futures game, won MVP honors in the celebrity All-Star softball game after hitting a homer in the "Nationals" 5-3 win and capped it with a homer on his first swing to give his team a win in the home run contest.\par \par \uc2 "It was a pretty good day," said Gonzalez, now special assistant to the president and CEO for the Diamondbacks. "What a great experience for the fans in Arizona."\par \par \uc2 The All-Star game had its usual bit of hijinks and hamming it for the camera, including Jenny Finch serving up a pitch with a soccer ball to U.S. soccer team captain Carlos Bocanegra.\par \par \uc2 There were also some impressive plays.\par \par \uc2 Rickey Henderson got it started the way he often did during his baseball career, leading off the game with a homer to left.\par \par \uc2 That might have been expected. Henderson does, after all, hold the all-time record with 81 leadoff homers.\par \par \uc2 "Glee" star Chord Overstreet had one of the more surprising moments, ranging from center field all the way to left to make a diving catch in front of country music singer Jason Aldean.\par \par \uc2 "I saw that it was low and between me and Jason, so I took a spring for it and did what I had to do to catch it," said Overstreet, who plays Sam Evans on the Fox TV show. "I ended up having to dive for it. Adrenaline kind of took over. it was fun and I had blast. I always dreamed of playing in a park like this ever since I was little."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 AP Sports Writer John Marshall contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110711e77b0001a\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The group also will include other DUI offenders.\par \par \uc2 Arpaio said the idea is to show the perils of drunken driving in Arizona, which has among the nation's toughest DUI laws. Asked why illegal immigrants are included in the chain gang, he said, "I would be discriminating against the people here illegally in this country who have been convicted of the same crimes U.S. citizens have been convicted of. Should I say, `Oh, no, you can't be on a chain gang because you're from a different country?'"\par \par \uc2 The sheriff's office, known for its anti-\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  sweeps of neighborhoods and businesses, said all chain gang participants volunteered for the duty rather than remain in "Tent City," jail homes, which have no air conditioning.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 GOLDEN HOMERS: A few of the balls used in Monday's home run derby will have a little something extra for the fans who catch them: gold.\par \par \uc2 The special balls will be made with one panel that's infused with 24-carat gold leather and will be used once a batter is down to his final out in each round of the derby.\par \par \uc2 The balls have a retail value of $149.99, so anyone who manages to snag one at Chase Field will get a little extra value for their effort.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.  \par \par \uc2 BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) - For some, opposing Alabama's toughest-in-the-nation law against illegal immigration is a chance for Bible Belt redemption.\par \par \uc2 During the civil rights movement of the 1950s and `60s, many state churches didn't join the fight to end Jim Crow laws and racial segregation. Some cross-burning Ku Klux Klan members took off their hoods and sat in the pews with everyone else on Sunday mornings, and relatively few white congregations actively opposed segregation. Some black churches were hesitant to get involved for fear of a white backlash.\par \par \uc2 Now that Alabama has passed what's widely considered the nation's most restrictive state law against illegal immigration, mainstream churches, faith-based organizations and individual members are at the forefront of opposition to the act. Some see their involvement as a way to avoid repeating mistakes of the past.\par \par \uc2 "I think what happened in the `60s may be a stimulus for the action that you have seen many of the churches taking on this," said Chriss H. Doss, an attorney and ordained Southern Baptist minister.\par \par \uc2 Matt Lacey, who is pastor of a United Methodist church once attended by Birmingham's infamous segregationist police commissioner Eugene "Bull" Connor, said there are all sorts of reasons Alabama Christians are opposed to the law. Making amends for the past inaction of religious groups is among them, he said.\par \par \uc2 "For me, as pastor of a church that was engaged in that battle, it is very important," said Lacey. "If we take redemption very seriously, then it not only covers our sins but our past actions as a church. I think for some, there is a tendency to want to be on the side of right on this issue. ... I would like to think the church just wants to do what's right."\par \par \uc2 After a prayer for wisdom, members of the Birmingham City Council unanimously passed a resolution recently calling for the repeal of the law. That same day, ministers and lay people gathered to discuss opposition to the law in the same church where, more than 50 years ago, white segregationists gathered to form a group to oppose white and black children going to school together.\par \par \uc2 Urged to come to a rally and candlelight march sponsored by churches and faith-based groups, a diverse crowd estimated around 2,000 marched quietly through downtown streets on a Saturday night near where police dogs snapped at black demonstrators two generations ago. And more than 100 United Methodist ministers -- many of them moderate to liberal, but some also on the conservative side -- signed an open letter to the governor criticizing the law.\par \par \uc2 Doss is struck by the differences between 2011 and 1963, when the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. wrote his "Letter from a Birmingham Jail" to seven white moderate ministers and a rabbi who were publicly urging him to go slower with the campaign to end legalized segregation. Many black churches also were slow initially to embrace the cause of civil rights in Birmingham, where Klan night riders roamed with bombs for years.\par \par \uc2 "There were a number of black ministers who took a more conservative position, that they were not going to get involved publicly. Their involvement greatly increased through the years," said Wayne Coleman, head of archives at the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute.\par \par \uc2 Churches had little to say about the bill as it moved through the Alabama Legislature, but that could be because they were overwhelmed for weeks providing food and other assistance to victims of the deadly tornadoes that swept across the state on April 27, killing more than 240 people. In contrast, denominational leaders were outspoken at the Georgia General Assembly as a similarly tough law moved toward final passage in Atlanta.\par \par \uc2 Religious leaders have been less vocal in Georgia since legislators passed the law, but a federal judge blocked key provisions of that act this week. Now in Alabama, leaders among the state's fast-growing Hispanic community hope the involvement of churches will help lead to a repeal of the law, signed earlier this month by Republican Gov. Robert Bentley, a Southern Baptist deacon and Sunday school teacher.\par \par \uc2 "It's huge to have the faith community come together and speak out in such great numbers against this new law," said Isabel Rubio, executive director of the Hispanic Interest Coalition of Alabama. "Because we're in the middle of the Bible Belt, we certainly expect that the faith communities' influence ... will land on folks' ears who are willing to listen."\par \par \uc2 Religious opposition to the new law -- which has included not just Christian churches but Jewish congregations and Muslim leaders -- is two-fold.\par \par \uc2 Some see the issue in faith terms. Christians compare biblical instructions to welcome strangers and love others with the law's restrictions against knowingly assisting illegal immigrants by helping them secure a place to live, a job, health care other than for emergencies and even a ride to the store. Under the law, police can check anyone's immigration status during a traffic stop or other encounter and jail people without bond if they don't have proper documents.\par \par \uc2 Fernando del Castillo, pastor of a Spanish-speaking congregation of about 300 people in metro Birmingham, is particularly worried about a provision requiring that schools check the immigration status of students and report the information to the state. He fears some immigrant parents will be afraid to send their children to school when classes resume in August.\par \par \uc2 "Will they keep them at home? I don't know," said del Castillo.\par \par \uc2 Others see the issue more as a case of the state potentially interfering with the traditional work of congregations. They fear the state is criminalizing missions work by restricting the types of interactions that citizens are allowed to have with residents living in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 "They wonder if this is the beginning of infringing on freedoms that the church has considered its bailiwick," said Doss.\par \par \uc2 Leaders of the United Methodist Church, the Episcopal Church, the Lutheran Church and the Roman Catholic Church all have criticized the law as running counter to biblical teachings about caring for neighbors, helping visitors and showing hospitality to strangers.\par \par \uc2 The state's largest denomination, the Alabama Baptist Convention, hasn't taken a position publicly and likely won't since it doesn't speak for individual churches. Convention president Mike Shaw, pastor of a church in suburban Birmingham, said the law "is the toughest in the nation and personally I think all laws need to be enforced."\par \par \uc2 "I am concerned about the language concerning giving a ride in an automobile to an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  or allowing children of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  parents to ride on a church bus to Sunday school, vacation Bible school, or church camp," he said in a statement.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.  \par \par \uc2 The Norman Transcript. July 6, 2011.\par \par \uc2 Oklahoma's economic recovery continues\par \par \uc2 State treasurer Ken Miller called a press conference on the day after the Fourth of July. He wasn't about to fire off a dud. It was going to be spectacular or he wouldn't have summoned the scribes.\par \par \uc2 Miller, in his first six months of office, reported double-digit increases in revenue for June 2011 over June 2010. He said gross receipts for the month of June outpaced last year's collections by more than 15 percent.\par \par \uc2 Figures released by Treasurer Ken Miller show gross receipts for every major tax collection category in June exceeded the amount collected in June 2010. His report shows gross collections topped $1 billion, an increase of more than $134 million, or $15.5 percent, from the same time last year.\par \par \uc2 The report comes as state agencies begin to adjust to budgets which began on July 1. Lawmakers used all of the state's rainy day fund to backfill the state's 2012 budget which was short about $500 million.\par \par \uc2 Lawmakers have pledged to replenish the rainy day fund and will be able to deposit more money into the fund, thanks to a constitutional change overwhelmingly approved by voters.\par \par \uc2 Oklahoma's unemployment has remained below the national average. The number of job losses has been high but some of the state's largest manufacturers were helped by a resurgent oil and gas industry.\par \par \uc2 If the revenue stream continues strong, lawmakers should look at a Special Session to adjust a few appropriations. Start with the $5,000 bonuses removed from nationally certified teachers. The state Department of Education has passed the bonus responsibility on to individual school districts.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 The Oklahoman. July 6, 2011.\par \par \uc2 International law and the death penalty\par \par \uc2 Prosecuting a killer for a capital crime is a sticky wicket. Things get even stickier when the defendant is from another country. Oklahoma prosecutors are well aware of this.\par \par \uc2 The issue of international law's bearing on U.S. death penalty cases is again front and center, this time in Texas with the case of Humberto Leal Garcia Jr., a Mexican national whose execution is scheduled this week. Garcia is one of three dozen or so Mexicans on death rows around the country.\par \par \uc2 Gerardo Valdez, sentenced to die in an Oklahoma court for a 1989 Anadarko murder, isn't among the death row denizens. Had he not won a legal battle to avoid a lethal injection, Valdez likely would have been executed. Instead his sentence was commuted to life in prison without the possibility of parole.\par \par \uc2 A Vietnamese man, Hung Thanh Le, didn't escape the needle. The killer was executed in 2004 despite an appeal from the Vietnamese government.\par \par \uc2 At issue in the cases of Garcia, Valdez and Osbaldo Torres, another Oklahoma killer from Mexico, is the right of foreign nationals to seek legal assistance from their consulates. The three defendants weren't afforded this right. The sticky wicket is whether foreign nationals accused of murder should have access to better, more expensive legal counsel than the average U.S. citizen who's charged with a capital crime. The latter often must rely on public defenders, whose offices are poorly funded.\par \par \uc2 Poor Mexican nationals have no means to hire high-dollar lawyers, but they're supposed to get help from their own governments, providing resources to perhaps help establish why a killer shouldn't have been charged with a capital crime.\par \par \uc2 Mexico hasn't executed its own killers since 1961. It officially abolished the death penalty in 2005. Government policy in Mexico, a country that has no problem with blood sports such as bullfighting, is to oppose capital punishment for its citizens convicted of murder -- regardless of where the crime took place.\par \par \uc2 Valdez avoided the needle after months of legal wrangling when Frank Keating was governor of Oklahoma. Keating declined a request to commute the sentence, but Valdez found favor with an appeals court. Keating's successor, Brad Henry, commuted the sentence of Torres, whose execution was stayed by the governor amid pressure from international groups.\par \par \uc2 Le, though, was executed March 23, 2004, after a last meal of eggs rolls and fried rice.\par \par \uc2 Executing foreign nationals is a side issue to the ongoing immigration debate. While it may stick in your craw that an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  has access to better counsel than a citizen, the bearing of international law on this matter should be taken seriously.\par \par \uc2 We just wish our federal government would take the issue of illegal immigration more seriously.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Tulsa World. July 2, 2011.\par \par \uc2 The dismantling of public education\par \par \uc2 When the Legislature starts cutting spending, guess who's going to take the biggest hit? Those who need it most.\par \par \uc2 The attack on public education continued recently. The state school board, guided by Secretary of Education Janet Baressi, cut $2.3 million in fiscal 2012 matching funds for all adult education programs statewide.\par \par \uc2 Earlier the board took a good chunk of state money from the award-winning and successful Street School in Tulsa, leaving it scrambling to stay open.\par \par \uc2 The latest outrage is the assault on adult education. As of recently, a Tulsa-based program that serves several northeastern Oklahoma communities will be denied $275,000 in state funding that is required to receive about $825,000 in matching federal funding.\par \par \uc2 The program allows adults to achieve a GED and attend English as a second language classes.\par \par \uc2 The program was expected to attract an additional 1,500 students with the addition of the Tulsa Public Schools service area. That could bring the total enrollment up to 3,800. That would be lot of adults getting a high school diploma and earning a better living. It would also mean offering immigrants the chance to learn English and get jobs, which would mean more people paying taxes.\par \par \uc2 Yes, times are tough and money is tight. But public education has taken hit after hit in cuts. It's enough to make one wonder if there is not a concerted effort to cripple if not kill the public school system.\par \par \uc2 The Republican mantra for years has been that public schools are failing and wasting money. Public schools critics say that alternatives such as vouchers would solve the education problem, give parents more choices and save money.\par \par \uc2 No doubt, there are students who might perform better in a private school. But vouchers, which would divert public money to private schools, are not the answer. The mandate of public schools is to educate everyone. Private schools are under no such mandate.\par \par \uc2 Do voucher proponents really believe that private schools will be open to everyone? What about the slow learners? What about those whose voucher doesn't cover the cost? What about the handicapped?\par \par \uc2 Private schools, which play an important role in education, should resist the voucher proposals. Many have at least loose religious affiliations and they shouldn't want the separation of church and state battle on their hands.\par \par \uc2 A cynic would say that the plan is to reduce the public schools' funding so that they cannot compete. Their test scores will plummet, their national rankings will sink even further and then they can be declared educationally bankrupt and effectively dismantled.\par \par \uc2 When legislators and candidates speak of their devotion to education the question is: Whose education? Everyone's or only a select few?\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Muskogee Phoenix. July 1, 2011.\par \par \uc2 Election lacks reason to believe\par \par \uc2 Two friends decide they want to celebrate their 50th birthdays by learning to skydive.\par \par \uc2 Each takes a class to learn how a parachute works, how to fold it, and how to pack it. On jump day, one friend decides to back out. He watches his friend get in the plane. The friend on the ground believes his friend's parachute will open. The friend in the plane has faith.\par \par \uc2 For government to fulfill its role, the people must not only believe in its government, but have faith as well.\par \par \uc2 The people must trust the system works. The people must have faith in their leaders and the process of free elections. The election of principal chief of the Cherokee Nation must try the faith of Cherokee citizens.\par \par \uc2 There have been too many twists and turns to reach a final outcome of who will run the Nation for the next four years. There have been one too many "winners."\par \par \uc2 Cherokee citizens put their faith in the system. Cherokee citizens deserved a more transparent, swift and precise outcome.\par \par \uc2 The citizens learned that Bill John Baker won office by a margin of 266 votes, 7,613-7,347. But, this came after learning that Chad Smith won by seven votes, 7,609 to 7,602.\par \par \uc2 But, that came after learning that Baker had unofficially won by 11 votes, 7,600 to 7,589.\par \par \uc2 Three outcomes. Three vote totals.\par \par \uc2 By the time final totals came out, the total number of votes changed by 251 votes.\par \par \uc2 How can a people as proud as the Cherokees be expected to be proud of a system that appears this flawed?\par \par \uc2 After the announcement by the Cherokee Supreme Court that Baker's victory will stand, both candidates questioned the credibility of the process.\par \par \uc2 When asked about the discrepancy in the total results, attorney for the Cherokee Nation Election Commission Lloyd Cole said, "Draw your own conclusions."\par \par \uc2 We conclude someone failed to do their job.\par \par \uc2 Responding to criticism of the credibility of the Election Commission, Cole said, "Everyone's entitled to their own opinions."\par \par \uc2 Our opinion is someone failed to do their job.\par \par \uc2 Unfortunately, when an election process appears to be embarrassingly flawed, the Cherokee people will have a difficult time making a leap of faith in their government.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110708e778002kq\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) - Civil rights groups sued Friday in federal court to block Alabama's new law cracking down on illegal immigration, which supporters and opponents have called the strictest measure of its kind in the nation.\par \par \uc2 The lawsuit, filed in Huntsville, claims the new law will make criminals out of church workers who provide shelter to immigrants and even citizens who give their neighbors a ride to the store or to the doctor's office.\par \par \uc2 "This law interferes with the free exercise of religion. It criminalizes acts of love and hospitality," said Scott Douglas, executive director of Greater Birmingham Ministries.\par \par \uc2 The lawsuit said the measure goes well beyond similar laws passed in Arizona, Utah, Indiana and Georgia. Federal judges already have blocked all or parts of the laws in those states. It asks a judge to declare Alabama's law unconstitutional and prevent it from being enforced.\par \par \uc2 Alabama's law, which takes effect Sept. 1, allows police to arrest anyone suspected of being an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  if the person is stopped for some other reason. It also requires businesses to check the legal status of new workers; makes it a crime to knowingly give a ride to an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 ; and makes it a crime for landlords to knowingly rent to illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 The lawsuit said parents may not enroll their children in elementary and high schools because of the law's provision requiring schools to check the immigration status of students. Lawmakers have said that the intent of that requirement is to gauge how much the state is spending to educate illegal immigrants, and that the law does not prohibit illegal immigrants from attending public schools.\par \par \uc2 Matthew Webster was among the individuals who joined the lawsuit as plaintiffs. He and his wife, who live in the community of Alabaster south of Birmingham, are in the process of adopting two boys who are already in the country illegally. Webster, who described himself as politically conservative, said he feared the boys could face deportation under the new law before the adoption process is done and the boys are in the U.S. legally.\par \par \uc2 He said the boys "have the fear of being picked up" even walking to school.\par \par \uc2 "This criminalizes me and my wife for harboring and transporting these kids," he said.\par \par \uc2 The new law also could lead to racial profiling and conjures memories of Alabama's troubled segregationist past by making life more difficult for a targeted class of people, according to the lawsuit.\par \par \uc2 "Individuals who may be perceived as `foreign' by state or local law enforcement agents will be in constant jeopardy of harassment and unlawfully prolonged detention by state law enforcement officers," the lawsuit said.\par \par \uc2 A sponsor of the bill, House Majority Leader Micky Hammon, a Republican from Decatur, said he is confident the courts will find that the law passes constitutional muster.\par \par \uc2 In a statement, Hammon called the organizations that filed the lawsuit, including the Montgomery-based Southern Poverty Law Center, the American Civil Liberties Union, and the Hispanic Interest Coalition of Alabama, "liberal groups working to shield those who live here illegally."\par \par \uc2 "It is important to note that our law seeks to protect immigrants who reside here legally while affecting only those who break our laws with their simple presence. We cannot turn a blind eye toward those who thumb their noses at our borders and our laws," Hammon said.\par \par \uc2 Hammon and other supporters say the immigration law will ease unemployment in Alabama by opening up jobs currently held by illegal immigrants. More than 200,000 people in Alabama were unemployed in May, according to the most recent statistics available. The Pew Hispanic Center estimates there are about 120,000 illegal immigrants in the state, many of whom are believed to be working at farms, chicken processing plants and in construction.\par \par \uc2 But the legal director of the Southern Poverty Law Center, Mary Bauer, said the new law could discourage overseas businesses from bringing new jobs to Alabama.\par \par \uc2 "It sends a message that people who look foreign are not welcome in our state," Bauer said. "If we are really talking about creating jobs, this is the worst form of political posturing by politicians."\par \par \uc2 Alabama House Speaker Mike Hubbard, a Republican, defended Alabama's law, saying "I'm not sure what part of the word `illegal' some people don't understand."\par \par \uc2 "It isn't fair to the generations of immigrants who have come to this country legally for us to look the other way while others break the law and cheat the system," he said.\par \par \uc2 The lawsuit was filed by various organizations across northern Alabama that represent immigrant groups as well as individual immigrants who are listed under the pseudonyms John Doe and Jane Doe. The lawsuit names as defendants various state and local officials, including Republican Gov. Robert Bentley, Attorney General Luther Strange and state schools Superintendent Joe Morton.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110708e778002d1\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 LOS ANGELES (AP) - A California State Bar panel is considering whether an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who passed the exam to practice law should be admitted despite his status.\par \par \uc2 The case of Mexican-born Sergio Garcia could be the first reviewed by the panel since California began asking applicants about their immigration status in 2008, the Daily Journal reported Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 Garcia attended college in Chico and passed the Bar exam in July 2009. Since then, he has been waiting to see if he can be admitted even though he is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . He now works as a paralegal.\par \par \uc2 Garcia was brought to the United States by his parents when he was 17 months old, said Erica Tomlinson, his immigration attorney. He has been sponsored for legal status by a relative, but the process could take another five to 15 years.\par \par \uc2 "It's not a fun way to live," Garcia told the legal newspaper.\par \par \uc2 The panel could review Garcia's case as soon as this week to decide whether to certify him. If certified, the state Supreme Court would subsequently decide whether to accept him.\par \par \uc2 Several attorneys who focus on ethics said they were unaware of such cases in the past, but Garcia's may not be the only one pending. Non-citizens can be admitted to the Bar, and in the past some illegal immigrants were approved without disclosing their status, the Journal reported.\par \par \uc2 In 2008, California began asking applicants who are not U.S. citizens about their immigration status on their moral character determination application, said Diane Curtis, a spokeswoman for the State Bar of California.\par \par \uc2 Curtis declined to comment on Garcia's case, or any others, because applications are confidential.\par \par \uc2 Jerome Fishkin, Garcia's lawyer, declined to comment on the case.\par \par \uc2 Erica Moeser, president of the Wisconsin-based National Conference of Bar Examiners, said she did not believe immigration status was addressed on most state bar associations' applications.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Information from: Daily Journal.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110707e777002wx\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - This will be the first year that \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  Maria Praeli can consider going to college fulltime.\par \par \uc2 She and her family had feared that the cost would be more than they could afford. But the 18-year-old high school student can now qualify for in-state tuition at Connecticut's public universities under a law that took effect last week.\par \par \uc2 The law can reduce tuition costs by as much as $17,000 annually for undocumented students such as Praeli, a rising senior at New Milford High School who is plans to apply to state schools.\par \par \uc2 "It gives me something to work for," said Praeli, a native of Peru who was taken to the United States when she was 5 years old. "It's easier to see your future."\par \par \uc2 Connecticut is now among 12 states, including New York and Illinois, that grant in-state tuition to illegal immigrants who are working toward legal status. Advocates also have been pushing for a federal law providing a path to legalization for qualified \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students and other young adults, but the federal legislation known as the DREAM Act has failed repeatedly in Washington.\par \par \uc2 At a ceremonial bill signing on Thursday, Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, a Democrat, touted the law as a way to help Connecticut's youth prepare for jobs in a fast-changing economy.\par \par \uc2 "These are children who live in Connecticut, contribute to our economy and are part of the fabric of our state. This bill isn't controversial, it's common sense," Malloy said.\par \par \uc2 Fewer than 50 illegal immigrants are expected to take advantage of the new law immediately, with the University of Connecticut expecting less than 10 for its next term. But advocates say that number could rise to 250 across Connecticut within the year as enrollment increases at community colleges in particular.\par \par \uc2 Lawmakers who supported the tuition change say it makes sense to give students who were raised as Americans a chance to succeed. Opponents say it is unfair to legal residents who could lose a spot in the in-state pool because of the new law.\par \par \uc2 The law requires the undocumented students to attend four years of high school in Connecticut and then file a statement with their college or university saying they will apply for legal residency when eligible to do so. Currently, if an illegal resident applies for lawful status they are subject to deportation.\par \par \uc2 The tuition savings can make a huge difference for Praeli and other immigrant students. In-state tuition at the University of Connecticut is $8,256, compared with the $25,152 out-of-state tuition rate that illegal immigrants have had to pay.\par \par \uc2 Praeli said she knew she couldn't have afforded to go to college full time like most of her high school friends. She likely would have had to work a full-time job and go to school part time, or not at all. It was a subject she avoided talking about.\par \par \uc2 "It was kind of like a reality that I didn't want to accept. I considered the whole thing unfair," Praeli said. She said she does not have a first-choice school and has not decided what she wants to study.\par \par \uc2 While a college education may be more affordable for students like Praeli, sizeable barriers remain. Illegal immigrants are not eligible for most financial aid, and once they get a degree they can't legally work in the U.S. without being a registered citizen.\par \par \uc2 John Skrentny, director of the Center for Comparative Immigration Studies at the University of California, San Diego, said laws such as the Connecticut measure raise as many problems as they solve.\par \par \uc2 "On the one hand these offer some opportunities for some of these kids, on the other hand it doesn't prepare them for a job they can legally work at," Skrentny said. "States can do a lot to help out illegal immigrants, but the one thing they cannot do is make them legal."\par \par \uc2 Mariano Cardoso, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Mexico who attended community college in Hartford, said the law will help people in similar situations, but he agreed it can only do so much.\par \par \uc2 "It's a lot of help, but it's not really enough for any student that's undocumented," Cardoso said. "For someone who cannot have a job, it's not really enough," he said.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110707e777002gu\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) - When an award-winning journalist recently revealed he's an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , two of the key players in his tale turned out to be educators who helped keep his secret. It's the kind of story teachers and principals scattered across the country know well.\par \par \uc2 With some 11 million illegal immigrants in the U.S., educators increasingly find themselves caught between their obligation to educate each child and conflicting guidance, or simply no direction at all, about whether to help such students beyond the classroom.\par \par \uc2 Law officers and lawmakers in some states want schools to help spot illegal immigrants. Federal authorities remind school officials that every child is entitled to an education. National education groups echo that but recommend that schools avoid getting involved when it comes to students' citizenship issues.\par \par \uc2 Ultimately, the adults in each classroom have to decide for themselves how far they will go.\par \par \uc2 Rich Fischer and Pat Hyland were school administrators in affluent Mountain View, Calif., home of \uc2 Google\uc2  and other tech companies, in 2000 as a young Filipino student named Jose Antonio Vargas was nearing graduation. He excelled in school but wasn't going to college because of his residency status and the high cost.\par \par \uc2 "We're educators. We don't work for the I.N.S.," Fischer, now retired as school superintendent, told The Associated Press, adding that teachers across the country face the same issues more and more.\par \par \uc2 "Actually, I think if you put a number to it, I think it would look epidemic and tragic."\par \par \uc2 Fischer and Hyland considered adopting Vargas, and eventually found him a scholarship to San Francisco State University. Vargas was a college standout, eventually landing an internship and then a full-time job at The Washington Post, getting the internship after Fischer, Hyland and others helped him get a driver's license.\par \par \uc2 "I'm not really sure if I could have made it without them," Vargas, part of a team of Post journalists who won a 2008 Pulitzer Prize for their coverage of the Virginia Tech massacre, told the AP.\par \par \uc2 Hyland, who was the principal at Mountain View High School when Vargas was there, said the help she provided was "sort of humanitarian, in my mind."\par \par \uc2 She has helped other illegal immigrants find a way to college. Many stop short, though, out of fear, she said.\par \par \uc2 "It's a conundrum. ... What are we doing to help this child survive and help this child reach his or her potential?" she said. "Educators are stuck in that position. We are sort of an underground support network for a lot of kids who come to us."\par \par \uc2 Hyland and Fischer said they're not overly concerned about legal consequences from helping Vargas.\par \par \uc2 "When you kind of put the human factor into it and say `Well, my gosh, I'm not helping somebody rob a bank here. I'm actually helping somebody become a productive citizen,' it feels different," Fischer said.\par \par \uc2 Teachers in Georgia, where a new law cracking down on illegal immigrants is being challenged in court, have been supporting students for years in many of the same ways.\par \par \uc2 Sean McKenzie, a high school social studies teacher in Calhoun, Ga., said he learned one former student came to the United States alone from Mexico at 14. The boy, whom McKenzie declined to name because it could make him a target for state authorities, worked hard to pass the state's graduation test.\par \par \uc2 A fellow teacher tried to adopt the teen, and housed him for at least five years. But it didn't open any path to citizenship. The student has since earned a nursing degree but can't get a job. He is thinking of leaving Georgia to find a job washing dishes or anything he can find.\par \par \uc2 "I just want a life," the student recently told McKenzie.\par \par \uc2 Michael Simpson, a National Education Association attorney, said the teacher's union doesn't view the issue as something it needs to educate teachers about.\par \par \uc2 The group issued a legal guide in 2009 with the National School Boards Association related to teaching "undocumented children" as more school attorneys inquired on the topic. The guide is mostly limited to explaining the Supreme Court's ruling that such students have a right to a public education. It advised schools not to ask about students' immigration status because it might discourage enrollment.\par \par \uc2 "We're all kind of left to fend on our own and make our own interpretations for what is right for ourselves and for our students," Hyland said. "I would far prefer that repairs to the system happen so that we're not put in this position and that the Joses of the world have more options that are legally available."\par \par \uc2 Elementary and middle school teachers may never know their students' immigration status because young students often don't know themselves. Still, some students reveal personal details.\par \par \uc2 Last year, a Montgomery County, Md., second-grader stood up during a conversation about immigration and told first lady Michelle Obama, "My mom doesn't have papers."\par \par \uc2 School officials in the Washington suburb worked to protect the girl's identity. The principal said they don't ask questions about immigration status but if families want to share, that's fine.\par \par \uc2 Alabama's Legislature recently passed a law requiring schools to report the immigration status of students. Anticipating such policies, the U.S. Education Department and Justice Department issued a joint letter to school districts in May reminding them they are required to provide all children equal access to public education.\par \par \uc2 Education Secretary Arne Duncan recently said the department is closely monitoring policies in Alabama and elsewhere.\par \par \uc2 "What we don't want to do is have a chilling effect. ... To have more students leave school or more students drop out ... would not be good for children, communities or the country," he said.\par \par \uc2 For McKenzie, the Georgia teacher, "it's a no-brainer: You've got a kid in front of you, you're supposed to help them."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writer Dorie Turner in Atlanta contributed to this report\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Brett Zongker can be reached at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://twitter.com/DCArtBeat"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://twitter.com/DCArtBeat}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110706e776002qd\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

Educators often find themselves wrestling with their obligation to educate each child and how much to help \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students outside the classroom.\par \par \uc2 Law officers and lawmakers in some states want schools to help spot illegal immigrants.

The groups had sued the government in 2005.

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc92}{\*\bkmkend toc92}\b \uc2 Ga. activist spent years pushing for stricter illegal immigration laws, was key to new measure\b0\par\par\uc2 By KATE BRUMBACK   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 1,142 \uc2 words\par \uc2 4 July 2011\par 09:42\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2011.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ATLANTA (AP) - With the fate of a proposal to crack down on illegal immigration still unknown in the frenetic final days of Georgia's legislative session, the bill's author was spotted several times huddled in hushed discussions in the Capitol hallways with D.A. King.\par \par \uc2 King, 59, has been a permanent fixture at the Capitol for years, lobbying lawmakers and rallying supporters for phone and letter-writing campaigns. The broad-shouldered, 6-foot-2 activist's approach is sometimes confrontational and always outspoken, making him a hero among those who favor stricter immigration enforcement -- and earning him plenty of enemies.\par \par \uc2 His advice has been welcomed by some legislators, including state Rep. Matt Ramsey, a Republican in the Atlanta suburb of Peachtree City who authored Georgia's strict measure.\par \par \uc2 "I can't think of anybody in my 20 years of working on this issue who has been more adroit in working inside the state Legislature to get legislation actually passed," said Roy Beck, executive director of NumbersUSA, which pushes for tighter immigration control. "He's just kind of at the top of the heap nationwide in terms of local activists."\par \par \uc2 Ramsey said King provided integral guidance when drafting the new law, and he rallied supporters to pressure lawmakers with phone calls and emails.\par \par \uc2 Even though a judge last week temporarily blocked two provisions of the law, King claims victory. He cited several parts that were not blocked, saying they "will greatly deter illegal aliens from attempting to take jobs in Georgia."\par \par \uc2 One will require businesses with 500 or more employees to use a federal database called E-Verify to check the immigration status of new hires starting Jan. 1. That requirement will be phased in for all businesses with more than 10 employees by July 2013. Another makes it a felony to use false information or documentation when applying for a job. Also starting Jan. 1, applicants for public benefits must provide at least one state or federally issued "secure and verifiable" document.\par \par \uc2 The Montgomery, Ala.-based Southern Poverty Law Center hasn't put King's organization on its list of hate groups. But the center lists him as a "nativist" and has expressed concern about his tendency to call illegal immigrants "invaders" and his contact with other more extreme activists.\par \par \uc2 "His tactics have generally not been to get up in the face of actual immigrants and threaten them," said the law center's Heidi Beirich. "Because he is fighting, working on his legislation through the political process, that is not something we can quibble with, whether we like the law or not."\par \par \uc2 Other critics take a harsher view.\par \par \uc2 "I think he works to push his agenda in a very divisive way," said Jerry Gonzalez, executive director of the Georgia Association of Latino Elected Officials. "One has to look at who this man is. He is a convicted felon who is advising our legislators and our governor on very important policy matters."\par \par \uc2 King talks openly about his felony conviction. He pleaded guilty in 1977 to a charge of interstate gambling, stemming from work he did answering phones and picking up money for a bookmaker taking bets on sporting events in Alabama. He was ordered to pay a fine and to serve two years of probation.\par \par \uc2 The grandson of a Detroit police officer, King grew up in the suburbs of that city, served two years in the U.S. Marine Corps and built a career as an insurance agent. He had no interest in politics or activism and didn't vote.\par \par \uc2 "What happened is when I started learning about illegal immigration, I went from being very, very shy to being very, very upset," he said.\par \par \uc2 In the late 1990s, a Mexican family moved in across the street from the house he shares with his wife in suburban Atlanta. Before long, there were about 20 people he suspected were in the country illegally living in the three-bedroom home, the yard was full of old vehicles and loud parties disrupted the neighborhood, King said. He complained to his local government about code violations but got no response, he said.\par \par \uc2 Then the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks marked his "aha moment," he said.\par \par \uc2 "I realized if I could have people living illegally across the street from me and there are people in the country who are flying planes into our buildings, this doesn't seem like a big effort at national security," he said.\par \par \uc2 That's when he began researching illegal immigration on an old hand-me-down computer from his brother-in-law.\par \par \uc2 The Pew Hispanic Center estimated Georgia's \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  population to be about 425,000 last year, making it the state with the seventh-largest \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  population.\par \par \uc2 King stopped working as an insurance agent in 2003 to devote himself full time to his cause and held a rally at the state Capitol in 2003, the first of more than two dozen. He also was profoundly affected by five trips to the Arizona-Mexico border between 2003 and 2006, he said.\par \par \uc2 He met Billy and Kathy Inman, whose 16-year-old son Dustin had been killed in a car crash caused by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , and in 2005 renamed his group from the American Resistance to the Dustin Inman Society at their request to make their son's name live on, he said.\par \par \uc2 "This crisis took more than 30 years to develop," he said. "There is no overnight solution."\par \par \uc2 But the federal government has a fundamental duty to the secure the nation's borders and to follow up on visas to make sure people leave once their time has expired, he said. Federal immigration authorities must also enforce the law so illegal immigrants won't come and won't stay, which he calls "attrition through enforcement." It is also important for English to be the official language of the U.S., he said.\par \par \uc2 He calls the groups who lobby against illegal immigration crackdowns "open borders crazies" and is quick to call or email journalists about their reporting on the topic.\par \par \uc2 "I know what gets left out of the news," he said. "I know and watch every day how illegal immigration is constantly spun."\par \par \uc2 King said he's working on a book, but making the fight against illegal immigration a full-time job for nearly a decade has left him deep in debt and forced him to refinance his house and sell stock his grandmother left him. He said soon he'll have to do what he can to "return to real life."\par \par \uc2 "I'm in no way quitting," he said, "but I don't know that I'm going to be regarded as furniture in the Georgia Capitol next year."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110704e774001xi\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc93}{\*\bkmkend toc93}\b \uc2 From Medicaid rates to drinking at the movies, Wisconsin's new budget will touch you\b0\par\par\uc2 1,012 \uc2 words\par \uc2 30 June 2011\par 16:24\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2011.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 MADISON, Wis. (AP) - Prospective politicians, college students, business owners, state workers and commuters all will face a new world when the new state budget takes effect Friday.\par \par \uc2 The Republican-crafted spending plan reshapes all corners of Wisconsin life, from how much Medicaid will cost to auto title loans to honoring former President Ronald Reagan to even drinking alcohol at the movies.\par \par \uc2 Here's a look at some of the ways the budget will reshape the state's priorities and touch lives across Wisconsin:\par \par \uc2 ------(equals)\par \par \uc2 ELECTIONS\par \par \uc2 --If you run for governor, the Legislature or the state Supreme Court, you'll have to raise all the money yourself. The budget ends public financing for campaigns for all those offices.\par \par \uc2 ------(equals)\par \par \uc2 LAW AND ORDER\par \par \uc2 --If you sue someone in small claims court, you could win more money. Under the budget, plaintiffs can recover up to $10,000 in small claims actions, double the old limit of $5,000 starting Friday.\par \par \uc2 --If you provide child care through the troubled Wisconsin Shares day-care program, get ready to be fingerprinted. A provision in the state budget that takes effect Friday requires the state Department of Children and Families to amend its rules and require any Wisconsin Shares provider to submit fingerprints to program administrators. The agency doesn't have a clear timeline for the revisions.\par \par \uc2 --If you're the parent of a child who had been sentenced to the Ethan Allen School, a detention facility for boys in Waukesha County, or the Southern Oaks Girls School, a detention facility for girls in Union Grove, you'll have to travel elsewhere to visit them. The budget shuts down both facilities and moves all the inmates to Lincoln Hills School in Lincoln County in far northern Wisconsin. The state Department of Corrections finished transferring the inmates earlier this week.\par \par \uc2 ------(equals)\par \par \uc2 TAXES\par \par \uc2 --If you're poor and trying to raise kids, life will get tougher. A state budget provision reduces income tax credits for poor families with two or more children by $65 million over the next two years. People will start seeing the changes when they file their taxes for 2011.\par \par \uc2 --If you're a Wisconsin business owner, it will get a little easier to exist in Wisconsin. The budget creates a new capital gains tax deferral for investments in Wisconsin-based companies, loosens taxes charged to multistate corporations and creates a new tax credit for manufacturers and agricultural businesses. Those changes should be fully phased in by 2016.\par \par \uc2 ------(equals)\par \par \uc2 HEALTH CARE\par \par \uc2 --If you rely on Medicaid, it's going to cost you more. The budget cuts $500 million from the health care program. The spending plan doesn't reduce benefits across the board or cut provider reimbursement rates, but participants will face higher co-pays and deductibles. It's unclear when those new costs might begin. The state needs federal approval for the changes and the Legislature's finance committee must sign off on them. State health officials haven't submitted any proposals to the committee yet.\par \par \uc2 ------(equals)\par \par \uc2 EDUCATION\par \par \uc2 --If you're a University of Wisconsin student, start saving your pennies. The budget allows the UW Board of Regents to increase tuition by up to 5.5 percent beginning with the fall semester.\par \par \uc2 --If you're a child of an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , going to college in Wisconsin is about to get much more expensive. The budget ends in-state tuition rates for children of illegal immigrants and forces them to pay out-of-state rates. Those changes will apply to anyone who enrolls for classes after Friday.\par \par \uc2 If you have a child in a K-12 public school, you might see changes over the next two years, depending on how your school district copes with a $800 million reduction in state aid to public education.\par \par \uc2 --If you're a middle school student who dreams of attending a public university in Wisconsin, things just got harder. A budget provisions ends the Wisconsin Covenant on Sept. 30. The covenant promises college financial aid to middle school students who promise to stay out of trouble and earn decent grades. Anyone who signs up before Sept. 30 could still participate, but after that, no more.\par \par \uc2 --If you live in Milwaukee County or Racine and you're fed up with the public schools, provisions in the state budget will help you out. People who live in those areas can apply for state dollars to subsidize private education for their children starting Friday.\par \par \uc2 ------(equals)\par \par \uc2 AUTO LOANS\par \par \uc2 --If you're down and out and need money pronto, you can again put your car up as collateral for a loan. The budget ends the state's ban on auto title loans.\par \par \uc2 ------(equals)\par \par \uc2 WIN ONE FOR THE GIPPER\par \par \uc2 --If you're a fan of former President Ronald Reagan, you'll get a new day starting next winter to celebrate. A provision in the state budget establishes Feb. 6 as Ronald Reagan Day. It's a symbolic measure to celebrate the Gipper's birthday and has no impact on state spending.\par \par \uc2 ------(equals)\par \par \uc2 PUBLIC RETIREES\par \par \uc2 --If you plan on working for the government, you'll have to toil longer before you're vested in the state retirement system. Under a measure Gov. Scott Walker inserted into the budget with his veto pen, new state and local government employees must work for five years to become vested in the system. Right now they become vested immediately.\par \par \uc2 ------(equals)\par \par \uc2 BEER `N FLICKS\par \par \uc2 --If you like suds with your movies, you might soon be able to kick back with a cold one (or two) in your favorite theater. The budget allows theaters to apply for liquor licenses.\par \par \uc2 ------(equals)\par \par \uc2 GRIDLOCK\par \par \uc2 --If you're sick of traffic jams on the way in or out of Milwaukee, help might be on the way -- in a few years. The budget makes $225 million available beginning Friday to rebuild the Zoo Interchange, where U.S. Highway 45, Interstate 94 and Interstate 894 meet. Construction, however, isn't expected to begin until 2015.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110630e76u0036n\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

(AP) - Federal prosecutors want a Mississippi businessman to forfeit $475,000 for employing illegal immigrants, including some who worked construction jobs at the federal courthouse where he was convicted in the scheme and at a nearby military base.\par \par \uc2 Randy Weitzel of Gulfport was identified in court records as the operator of Biloxi-based Artisan Textures Inc. and Procoat of LA Inc., based in Baton Rouge, La. He pleaded guilty June 3 to conspiracy to defraud the United States. Sentencing is set for Sept. 1.\par \par \uc2 Assistant U.S. Attorney Gaines H. Cleveland filed a motion Tuesday that asked for a final order of forfeiture for the money. Weitzel's lawyer didn't immediately respond to a call requesting comment.\par \par \uc2 Weitzel was convicted along with two other men, Woody Brodtmann Jr. of Bay St. Louis and Agustin Arcadia of Vancleave. Weitzel and Brodtmann were indicted in 2009 for knowingly hiring and harboring illegal immigrants, including some who worked for Artisan Textures at Keesler Air Force Base in Biloxi as far back as 2003. Arcadia was charged later.\par \par \uc2 Keesler is home to the 81st Training Wing and a unit known as the Hurricane Hunters, which flies into storms to gather data. It also has one of the largest Air Force medical facilities in the country.\par \par \uc2 Keesler officials have declined in the past to discuss how illegal immigrants made it through the base's security checks. A Keesler spokesman did not immediately respond Wednesday to a message.\par \par \uc2 Besides, the courthouse and military base, prosecutors said some of the illegal immigrants also worked in construction jobs at least one casino on the Mississippi Gulf Coast.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors said they had proof Weitzel knew some of his workers were illegal -- in 2003 he allegedly stopped paying a worker under one name and began paying him under another name.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors said Weitzel rented homes for illegal immigrants as far back as 2000. Police raided one of the homes in 2004, but court records said federal immigration officials didn't have the resources to detain the illegal immigrants at the time. An unnamed coconspirator allegedly rented hotel rooms to hide the men.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110629e76t002a6\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) - A measure allowing in-state tuition for certain illegal immigrants in Maryland won't be among the many bills taking effect this week as scheduled, because state and local elections officials will need about three weeks to verify additional signatures opponents of the bill are submitting to put the legislation on the 2012 ballot for a statewide referendum.\par \par \uc2 Republican Delegate Neil Parrott, who has been leading the petition drive, said Wednesday he will bring more than the 8,448 signatures needed in addition to the 47,288 the Maryland State Board of Elections already has validated.\par \par \uc2 "We have that minimum number, and the question is how far above that number do we have," Parrott, R-Washington, said Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 Parrott said he will bring the petitions to the Maryland Secretary of State's office at 7 p.m. Thursday to meet a midnight deadline.\par \par \uc2 After the signatures are submitted, local elections boards will have until July 20 to verify them and return them to the Maryland State Board of Elections. Then, the state elections board will have two days to determine whether the 55,736 signatures needed are valid. If opponents fail to get the needed signatures, the bill would take effect Aug. 1.\par \par \uc2 If opponents ultimately succeed in putting the measure on the ballot, it will be the first time Maryland will have a referendum from a successful petition drive since 1992, when voters approved a bill guaranteeing abortion rights in Maryland.\par \par \uc2 An important part of the petition drive has involved using an online tool to make it easier for registered voters to submit signatures. The website provides the information a voter would need to include with his or her signature for it to be valid. More than a third of the signatures already validated by the board came from the website.\par \par \uc2 Parrott said organizers of the petition drive aimed to have 100,000 total signatures so they would have plenty to spare in case some were disqualified for technical reasons. Organizers also are bracing for legal challenges.\par \par \uc2 The American Civil Liberties Union of Maryland has written to the state elections board to ask that the legality of the online system be examined. The ACLU contends the online system at mdpetitions.com could be susceptible to fraud.\par \par \uc2 "We believe that the state board of elections needs to make a decision about online systems, and if they are going to be used, how they can conform to state law, because we do believe the system being used by mdpetitions.com is not in compliance with state elections law in addition to being susceptible to fraud," said Meredith Curtis, a spokeswoman for the ACLU of Maryland.\par \par \uc2 The measure was one of the most high-profile and contentious bills approved by the General Assembly in April. The House of Delegates passed the bill on a 74-65 vote. The Senate approved the legislation 27-20.\par \par \uc2 The bill allows illegal immigrants to pay in-state tuition rates at four-year public colleges if they complete two years at a community college after attending three years of high school. Students also will have to show that their parents paid state income taxes. Male students would be required to sign up for Selective Service to be eligible for the draft.\par \par \uc2 The Maryland legislation includes a provision that requires illegal immigrants receiving the reduced tuition rate to count as a part of the school's out-of-state student pool, so in-state student slots for Maryland residents won't be affected.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110629e76t0027n\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ATLANTA (AP) - Six young illegal immigrants were arrested Tuesday after they sat down and blocked traffic near the Georgia state Capitol to publicly declare their status and to protest state policies targeting people who are in the U.S. illegally, the latest in a string of such "coming out" events in Georgia and other parts of the country.\par \par \uc2 The young people were protesting a policy that bars Georgia's most competitive state colleges and universities from accepting illegal immigrants and they were opposing strict new state legislation. A federal judge on Monday blocked two key provisions of that law. The young people, who decided to risk arrest and deportation for their protest, say that's not enough.\par \par \uc2 Federal judges have now blocked parts of similar laws in Arizona, Utah, Indiana and Georgia from taking effect. Civil liberties groups have pledged to sue to block others in Alabama and South Carolina.\par \par \uc2 "It's time to stand up and let the world know that we need to fight for what we believe in," said Nataly Ibarra, a 16-year-old high school student.\par \par \uc2 Four of the young people arrested are high school students, one is a recent high school graduate and one is a 24-year-old college graduate. All six face charges of reckless conduct, obstructing law enforcement and obstructing the street. The three who are under 18 were to be released to their parents. Two 18-year-olds and the 24-year-old were set to be taken to the Fulton County Jail.\par \par \uc2 Barbara Gonzalez, press secretary for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, issued a statement after the arrests: "ICE takes enforcement action on a case by case basis -- prioritizing those who present the most significant threats to public safety as determined by their criminal history and taking into consideration the specific facts of each case, including immigration history."\par \par \uc2 Last year, four young people were arrested during a sit-in at U.S. Sen. John McCain's office in Arizona. Students at several suburban Atlanta high schools staged walkouts last month, and a group of seven \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  young people were arrested in April after they sat down in a downtown Atlanta street and blocked traffic to call attention to their situation. Five others were arrested in May at the Indiana office of Gov. Mitch Daniels after a protest grew confrontational.\par \par \uc2 Many of the activists hold out hope for the DREAM Act, legislation that would provide a path to legalization for certain young people brought to the U.S. illegally by their parents. The bill has been introduced several times in Congress without success. A Senate subcommittee held a hearing on the legislation Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 Several dozen students in their caps and gowns attended the hearing, despite their status as illegal immigrants. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., introduced several who had demonstrated excellence in many facets of life but were unable to get jobs in their chosen fields.\par \par \uc2 "They want to serve the country they love," Durbin said. "All they want is a chance."\par \par \uc2 Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said lawmakers from both parties have compassion for the students who would be helped by the legislation, but he said the details are important. He pointed to changes that he believes are necessary for the bill before it can gain more Republican support.\par \par \uc2 Opponents of the DREAM Act often agree that young people brought here when they're young have compelling stories. But giving them a path to legalization could create increased competition for young Americans who already are having trouble finding jobs, they say.\par \par \uc2 The Georgia university system last fall adopted a policy barring state colleges and universities that have rejected academically qualified students in the prior two years from accepting illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Judge Thomas Thrash on Monday ruled on a request by civil liberties groups to block Georgia's new illegal immigration law from taking effect until a lawsuit challenging its constitutionality is resolved. Thrash temporarily blocked a provision that authorizes police to check the immigration status of suspects without proper identification and to detain illegal immigrants and another that penalizes people who knowingly and willingly transport or harbor illegal immigrants while committing another crime.\par \par \uc2 The law's author, state Rep. Matt Ramsey, R-Peachtree City, has said it's needed to keep illegal immigrants from draining the state's resources.\par \par \uc2 Many parts of the law will take effect Friday. One of them makes it a felony to use false information or documentation when applying for a job. Another creates an immigration review board to investigate complaints about government officials not complying with state laws related to illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 Starting Jan. 1, businesses with 500 or more employees must use a federal database to check the immigration status of new hires. That requirement will be phased in for all businesses with more than 10 employees by July 2013. Also starting Jan. 1, applicants for public benefits must provide at least one state or federally issued "secure and verifiable" document.\par \par \uc2 Also on Tuesday, the Birmingham, Ala., City Council unanimously approved a resolution seeking the repeal of Alabama's new law targeting illegal immigration, with members calling it a hateful reminder of the state's not-too-distant past as a bastion of legalized racial segregation.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press Writer Kevin Freking in Washington, D.C., contributed to this story.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110628e76s003vc\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) - The Birmingham City Council unanimously approved a resolution seeking the repeal of Alabama's new law against illegal immigration on Tuesday, with members calling it a hateful reminder of the state's not-too-distant past as a bastion of legalized racial segregation.\par \par \uc2 Members of the nine-person council said the law, which Gov. Robert Bentley signed earlier this month and takes effect Sept. 1, could hurt the city's economy by scaring away business and reinforcing negative images of intolerance and bigotry linked to the state's old Jim Crow laws. Aside from the law's repeal, the resolution by Council President Roderick Royal also asked for the establishment of a statewide commission to consider policies on undocumented residents.\par \par \uc2 Council member Jonathan Austin said the illegal immigration law -- which both supporters and opponents agree is the nation's toughest -- would lead to racial profiling and the need for residents to keep citizenship documents with them constantly.\par \par \uc2 ""It is hateful and mean-spirited. It takes us back to an era that we have fought so hard to come out of," Austin said. "Something needs to be done about illegal immigration ... but this law is not what we need as a state."\par \par \uc2 Mayor William Bell compared the law to the statutes that once legalized decades of racial discrimination in Alabama.\par \par \uc2 "It says we still have people of the mentality who discriminate against a class of people," he said.\par \par \uc2 A message seeking comment was left with aides to Bentley, a Republican elected last year after campaigning on a pledge to pass the nation's most restrictive illegal immigration law. Last week, Bentley said he would be open to amending the law.\par \par \uc2 "You have to look at legislation that comes through," Bentley told WSFA-TV on Friday. "We will certainly look at that and see if there's any changes we need to make to it. But I think it's a very strong bill, that's what I asked for. It is the strongest immigration bill in the country, but we asked for that."\par \par \uc2 The law makes it a crime to knowingly hire an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 ; rent them a place to live; or give them a ride. A section that has come under particular criticism from opponents mandates that schools determine the immigration status of their students and report it to the state.\par \par \uc2 Council member Carole Smitherman, an attorney, said she supports a section of the law requiring that employers use a federal database to verify whether new workers are U.S. citizens.\par \par \uc2 "The rest of it ... will be subject to a constitutional challenge in short order," she said.\par \par \uc2 The Montgomery-based Southern Poverty Law Center and the American Civil Liberties Union are working on a lawsuit that could be filed soon challenging the law.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110628e76s002xs\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

They expect to be joined by civil rights leaders and community leaders\par \par \uc2 The rally inside the state Capitol is meant to protest a new law in Georgia that targets illegal immigration. A federal judge's ruling on Monday blocked some parts of that law, but other parts will take effect Friday or on Jan. 1 as set forth in the text of the law.\par \par \uc2 Rolando Zenteno, a student at Pebblebrook High School in Mableton, says he's participating in the rally because he's "tired of hiding."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110628e76s001p8\par }\par \b \uc2 Search
