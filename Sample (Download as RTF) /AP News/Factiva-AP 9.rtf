The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 LOS ANGELES (AP) - Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck said Wednesday that illegal immigrants should be issued driver's licenses in California to improve safety on the road and law enforcement efforts.\par \par \uc2 Beck said in an interview with the Los Angeles Times ( {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://lat.ms/ytjMtO"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://lat.ms/ytjMtO}}}\uc2 ) that the state has failed to reduce the number of illegal immigrants driving without a license.\par \par \uc2 The chief concern is safety on the road by forcing all drivers to take the rigorous testing to get a license, and the ability of police to identify the people they encounter, Beck said.\par \par \uc2 "Why wouldn't you want to put people through a rigorous testing process? Why wouldn't you want to better identify people who are going to be here?" Beck told the Times. "It doesn't make any sense to me. And we could increase safety on the roads. When you make things illegal you cause a lot of other things by chain reaction."\par \par \uc2 One type of crime that Beck believes would decrease is hit-and-run accidents, because \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  drivers wouldn't have to fear being caught without a license at the scene of such accidents, he said.\par \par \uc2 In recent months, Beck has pushed for changes to the LAPD's vehicle impound rules, which would ease fines faced by unlicensed drivers who have their cars towed and impounded.\par \par \uc2 Police commissioners were due to vote on the policy last week, but the Legislative Counsel Bureau, which advises state legislators, said local government doesn't have the authority to change the policy.\par \par \uc2 Currently, those caught driving without a valid license, including those who have had their licenses suspended or revoked, can have their cars impounded for up to 30 days.\par \par \uc2 Towing an impound charges often top $1,000, and advocates for the poor and immigrants say the punishment outweighs the wrong.\par \par \uc2 The vote was rescheduled for Feb. 28.\par \par \uc2 Beck said licenses issued to illegal immigrants should be different than regular ones, such as a provisional license or a non-resident license.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Information from: Los Angeles Times, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.latimes.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.latimes.com}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120223e82n000a0\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 MEXICO CITY (AP) - Demian Bichir learned an important lesson when he left his native Mexico to launch a U.S. acting career and ended up working in a Mexican restaurant in New York: How to live the invisible life of an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  with dignity.\par \par \uc2 It's a subtle quality he brings to his Oscar-nominated role of Los Angeles gardener Carlos Galindo in the movie "A Better Life."\par \par \uc2 Like Galindo, Bichir came to the U.S. illegally. The U.S. amnesty program in 1986 put him on the road to a Green Card. The character he plays is not so lucky, trying to climb the rungs from day worker to owner of a gardening business while keeping his American-born teenage son from street gangs.\par \par \uc2 "It was important for me to relate to that time when I arrived in New York," Bichir told The Associated Press. "Carlos Galindo's dignity is similar to all those 11 million undocumented workers in U.S. They live their lives with ... that power and that passion, and they never give up. That's me."\par \par \uc2 The result brought the first best actor nomination for a Mexican native since Anthony Quinn 47 years ago. Bichir is up against big-name stars Brad Pitt, George Clooney and Gary Oldman, as well as Jean Dujardin in Sunday's ceremony.\par \par \uc2 Until now, the 48-year-old Bichir has probably been Mexico's most successful low-profile Hollywood actor, having landed string of television and movie parts. American audiences may know him as Esteban Reyes, the raspy-voiced, corrupt Tijuana mayor and love interest of Mary-Louise Parker in the popular television series "Weeds."\par \par \uc2 The Oscar nod has brought him fame, even if "A Better Life" did not do well at the box office. It now has been getting a bit of a second life in downloads and rentals since the nomination.\par \par \uc2 He said the distinction won't change him as a person or an actor, though it may bring more opportunities to work with artists he admires. The tall, bearded Bichir, whose impishness comes through even sitting in a hard chair for a formal interview, said he'd rather not name names -- then artfully dropped two big ones.\par \par \uc2 "If I say Woody Allen, and Jim Jarmusch hears I didn't mention him, then he won't call me," he said. "And I want to work with him, too, right?"\par \par \uc2 Bichir grew up in a theater family that could be considered the Barrymores of Mexico, without the curse, though Bichir has made known his love for tequila. He joked in a press conference after the nomination that he will be carrying a flask on Oscar night.\par \par \uc2 He is the second of three brothers, all actors, who are so ubiquitous in Mexican theater and film that MTV once created a category for its Mexico awards, "Best Bichir in a Movie."\par \par \uc2 Bichir currently stars in a Mexican theater version of "Swimming With Sharks" as the lead, nightmare movie mogul Buddy Ackerman. The play is directed by his younger brother, Bruno. All three (the third brother is Odiseo) will be the voices of three inmate pigs in the upcoming animated Mexican film.\par \par \uc2 Before the brothers' fame, they were part of a middle class family headed by theater director Alejandro Bichir and actress Maricruz Najera.\par \par \uc2 Bichir first dreamed of being a professional soccer player. His mother recently told the Mexican newspaper El Universal that he was always tearing through the knees of his pants playing in the streets of Tlatelolco, a Mexico City neighborhood famous both as an ancient Aztec market and the scene of a 1968 student massacre.\par \par \uc2 Instead, he started acting, landing a role in the Mexican soap opera "Rina" at age 14.\par \par \uc2 Bichir headed to New York at age 21 or 22, he said, to expand his experience as an actor. He ended up busing tables at the Rosa Mexicana, the hardest work he said he has ever done. It was there he learned to make guacamole, something he said his mother did growing up.\par \par \uc2 "She made delicious guacamole and I never gave it much thought," he said.\par \par \uc2 The key to his recipe is chopping the avocado. No smashing.\par \par \uc2 After a short time he moved to Los Angeles, without success, and returned to Mexico, where he starred in films such as "Hasta Morir" (Until Death), which won him an Ariel award, the Mexican equivalent of an Oscar, and the comedy hit "Sexo, Pudor y Lagrimas," (Sex, Shame and Tears). Among dozens of roles, he played Miguel Hidalgo, the father of Mexican independence, in "Hidalgo: The Story Never Told," released during Mexico's 2010 bicentennial.\par \par \uc2 His Hollywood roles started with the television movie "The Time of Butterflies" with Mexican actress Salma Hayek in 2001 and include playing Cuban revolutionary Fidel Castro in Steven Soderbergh's "Che" in 2008, in addition to the recurring role on "Weeds."\par \par \uc2 Bichir has said in previous interviews that he thought he was reading for director Chris Weitz's "Twilight" vampire series when Weitz proposed a project about a gardener.\par \par \uc2 "A Better Life" is the first major Hollywood studio treatment of the plight of illegal immigrants, though they have been in the employ of movie executives and stars for decades. Bichir has compared the film to "Philadelphia" as a work that could start to change attitudes toward illegal immigrants the way Tom Hank's Oscar-winning performance perceptions around homosexuality and AIDS.\par \par \uc2 Mexican migration to the U.S. has dropped by 83 percent since its peak in 2007, when an estimated 500,000 people went to the U.S., according to the Mexican census agency. Still, people in the U.S. and Mexico, including Bichir, are urging President Barack Obama to tackle immigration reform for the millions who already live there and, like Carlos Galindo, stay below the radar to survive.\par \par \uc2 Bichir says it will take more than one film to change attitudes about the community.\par \par \uc2 "We lost the first round at the box office. This film did not become a huge hit," Bichir said. "They need to make these types of films important and a success to talk about some real commitment."\par \par \uc2 Bichir has done what his more famous counterparts, such as Gael Garcia Bernal and Diego Luna, haven't: win an Oscar nomination. Salma Hayek was nominated in 2003 for her role as Frida Kahlo.\par \par \uc2 The last male Mexican native to do so was Anthony Quinn, who was born in the border state of Chihuahua, though he grew up in the U.S. Quinn was nominated, for "Zorba the Greek" in 1964. He also won two best supporting actor awards for "Viva Zapata!" and "Lust for Life."\par \par \uc2 To have the same distinction as Quinn is "surreal," Bichir said.\par \par \uc2 "Everyone knows him, everyone loves him and he has always been a pride for Mexico," he said. "All I can say is that I wish I had that career, that at the end of my life I would have had at least a little bit of it ... and I hope it won't take another 48 years to have a Mexican nominated."\par \par \uc2 (This version CORRECTS spelling of Hayek)\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120223e82n001xe\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) - A federal judge has ruled that a grand jury will hear evidence in the case of a British man being held in Missouri on a federal weapons charge and who is also accused of robbing an armored car in England nearly 20 years ago.\par \par \uc2 Edward Maher, suspected of stealing an armored car containing the equivalent of about $1.5 million in England in 1993, has been living in the U.S. for several years. He was arrested Feb. 8 after authorities received a tip that he was living under his brother's name and working as a cable technician in the town of Ozark, about 160 miles southwest of Kansas City.\par \par \uc2 Maher, dubbed "Fast Eddie" in news reports after the armored-car theft, is accused of driving off in the armored car while a fellow security guard was making a delivery to a bank in Suffolk, England. The van was later abandoned, and the money -- 50 bags containing coins and notes worth 1 million pounds -- was missing.\par \par \uc2 Maher, 56, has been charged in a U.S. federal complaint with being an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  with a firearm. He has been in custody in Springfield since his arrest.\par \par \uc2 He appeared at the five-minute preliminary hearing in U.S. District Court in Springfield on the weapons charge with his public defender, David Mercer, according to a court document. Mercer declined comment when reached by telephone after the hearing.\par \par \uc2 U.S. District Judge James C. England found probable cause for the weapons charge against Maher, meaning there was enough evidence to proceed with the case. Also during the hearing, the judge ordered that a grand jury consider the federal charge against Maher, which is the expected next step in a federal case, said Don Ledford, spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Missouri.\par \par \uc2 The grand jury will hear the evidence against Maher and possibly decide if additional charges are warranted, Ledford said. It's unclear when or a where a federal grand jury will meet to hear the case.\par \par \uc2 Maher's case in the U.S. could avoid going to the grand jury if he pleads guilty to the charge or if he is extradited to England before the grand jury meets, Ledford said.\par \par \uc2 Federal officials have been discussing Maher's possible extradition with authorities in England, but nothing had been formalized as of Wednesday, Ledford said.\par \par \uc2 "That is a conversation that's ongoing," he said. Officials in England have said Maher's extradition could take months.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120222e82m001fc\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The National Hispanic Media Coalition said last year that it targeted the show's advertisers to urge them to stop backing the program.\par \par \uc2 The group said the hosts promote hate speech and appealed to listeners to call and harass an advocate for immigrant rights about state legislation to give financial aid to \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  college students.\par \par \uc2 "A temporary suspension is not enough," Alex Nogales, president and CEO of NHMC, said in a statement. "How many times do John and Ken get to spew their hate, apologize and then do it again after taking off a long weekend? KFI must permanently remove John and Ken from the air. Los Angeles deserves better."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120217e82h0016w\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SALT LAKE CITY (AP) - A federal judge said Friday he will decide within the next few days whether to allow Utah's immigration enforcement law to go into effect or delay his decision until after the U.S. Supreme Court rules on a similar law in Arizona.\par \par \uc2 If U.S. District Court Judge Clark Waddoups decides to wait, the law created by House Bill 497 will remain on hold for about another six months. It was first blocked by Waddoups eight months ago, 14 hours after it went effect.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2  is scheduled to hear arguments about Arizona's contentious enforcement law in April and is expected to issue a ruling in June. Waddoups said that ruling could provide some guidance about the constitutionality of Utah's law, which would allow police to check the citizenship of anybody they arrest but doesn't require police to check the citizenship of everybody they encounter.\par \par \uc2 Arguments during the lengthy and often technical hearing Friday focused mostly on whether the state was usurping federal authority over immigration. Civil rights groups also claim the law violates constitutional protections against unlawful searches and arrests.\par \par \uc2 Waddoups pressured state attorneys to explain how Utah can justify reaching beyond existing federal laws to make it a crime for an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  to enter the state. U.S. Justice Department attorneys, meanwhile, were pressed about what would stop the state from requesting information about a person's immigration status.\par \par \uc2 Justice Department attorney Josh Wilkenfeld said Utah was attempting to trump federal law by mandating that police officers check the immigration status of anybody booked into jail. He said similar laws in four other states -- Arizona, Alabama, Georgia and South Carolina -- have already been struck down by federal judges.\par \par \uc2 "Cooperation is on federal terms, not as the state defines it," Wilkenfeld said.\par \par \uc2 Utah's law is much different than the Arizona measure because it gives more discretion to police officers and doesn't allow suspected illegal immigrants to be detained indefinitely, Utah Assistant Attorney General Barry Lawrence said. Instead, the law simply reflects existing federal law and is only meant to ensure that the state can account for criminals who are also illegal immigrants, he said.\par \par \uc2 "This is not anywhere as invasive as people fear," Lawrence said. "The basic goal is to stop people from committing crimes in the state and quantify how many of those crimes are being committed by illegal aliens."\par \par \uc2 About 50 people protested the enforcement law outside of the courthouse, and one person was escorted from courtroom after he held up a sign opposing the law.\par \par \uc2 The American Civil Liberties Union and National Immigration Law Center sued a week before Utah's law went into effect to stop the implementation of House Bill 497, saying it could lead to racial profiling. The Justice Department joined the lawsuit in November, claiming the measure usurped federal authority.\par \par \uc2 The Utah law, signed in March by Republican Gov. Gary Herbert, would require police to check the citizenship status of anyone arrested on suspicion of a felony or class-A misdemeanor, while giving authorities discretion to check the citizenship of those stopped for traffic infractions and other lesser offenses. Class A misdemeanors include theft, negligent homicide and criminal mischief, while felonies range from aggravated burglary to rape and murder.\par \par \uc2 Herbert has maintained the law will eventually be found constitutional.\par \par \uc2 Utah lawmakers passed a package of immigration bills last year, including HB 497 and another bill that will allow illegal immigrants to live and work in the state if they haven't committed other crimes, have steady employment and pay taxes. That law takes effect in 2013 and the state is working with federal officials in an attempt to secure a waiver.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Josh Loftin can be reached at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://twitter.com/joshloftin"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://twitter.com/joshloftin}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120217e82h00107\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The National Hispanic Media Coalition said last year that it targeted the show's advertisers to urge them to stop backing the program.\par \par \uc2 The group said the hosts promote hate speech and appealed to listeners to call and harass an advocate for immigrant rights about state legislation to give financial aid to \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  college students.\par \par \uc2 "A temporary suspension is not enough," Alex Nogales, president and CEO of NHMC, said in a statement. "How many times do John and Ken get to spew their hate, apologize and then do it again after taking off a long weekend? KFI must permanently remove John and Ken from the air. Los Angeles deserves better."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Online:\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.kfiam640.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.kfiam640.com}}}\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.johnandkenshow.com/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.johnandkenshow.com/}}}\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.urbaninformer.com/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.urbaninformer.com/}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120216e82g0028l\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - Another person charged in the execution-style killings of three friends in a schoolyard has been convicted.\par \par \uc2 An Essex County jury found Jose Carranza guilty on three counts of felony murder and four counts of first-degree armed robbery. But Carranza was acquitted on three counts of murder and charges of attempted murder, sexual assault, conspiracy to commit robbery and conspiracy to commit murder.\par \par \uc2 The sexual assault was alleged to have been committed against a woman who survived the August 2007 attack, which took place in a playground behind Newark's Mount Vernon School. Investigators claimed that fingerprint evidence on a still-cold bottle of beer put Carranza in the schoolyard on the night the slayings occurred.\par \par \uc2 The verdict was returned Tuesday afternoon, a week after the jury got the case. Overall, the panel deliberated for about five days.\par \par \uc2 Assistant prosecutor Romesh Sukhdeo said: "If it were up to me he would have been convicted on all 19 counts, but I respect the verdict of the jury. We are satisfied with the verdict because it means Carranza faces life in prison when he is sentenced."\par \par \uc2 The 32-year-old Carranza, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Peru, was free on bail in an unrelated case when the killings occurred. He declined to testify in his own defense.\par \par \uc2 The slayings -- in which at least two victims were slashed with a machete before three were lined up against a wall and shot -- sent shockwaves through Newark and jump-started anti-crime measures such as the installation of surveillance cameras that were credited with decreasing violent crime in the state's largest city.\par \par \uc2 The three friends who were killed -- Dashon Harvey, Iofemi Hightower and Terrance "T.J." Aeriel -- died from gunshot wounds to their heads. All four victims were either attending or planning to attend Delaware State University that fall.\par \par \uc2 Two co-defendants have been convicted, and two others pleaded guilty. A sixth defendant is awaiting trial.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120215e82f0005t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

House panel opens hearings on immigration\b0\par\par\uc2 By JOHN HANNA   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 736 \uc2 words\par \uc2 13 February 2012\par 20:35\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2012.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) - Kansas business groups asked legislators Monday to set up a program for placing illegal immigrants in hard-to-fill jobs in agriculture and other industries as a House committee kicked off a week of hearings that are likely to highlight divisions among majority Republicans.\par \par \uc2 The Federal and State Affairs Committee scheduled two days of testimony on a bill drafted by a coalition that includes agriculture groups and the Kansas Chamber of Commerce, and their measure also drew support from immigrant rights advocates. They said the proposal represents a realistic approach to dealing with an estimated 45,000 \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  workers in Kansas.\par \par \uc2 But the committee also planned to begin hearings Wednesday on four bills backed by Secretary of State Kris Kobach and his allies, designed to discourage illegal immigrants from staying in Kansas. Kobach, a Republican, is a former law professor who helped draft tough laws in Alabama and Arizona.\par \par \uc2 Kobach criticized the bill backed by the business coalition as an amnesty measure for illegal immigrants and predicted it can't pass the House, where his fellow GOP conservatives are in the majority. But the state chamber is a major player in Republican politics, and the agriculture groups joining it not only lean toward the GOP but have strong influence among rural lawmakers.\par \par \uc2 Chairman Steve Brunk, a Bel Aire Republican, said he's not yet sure which approach the committee will embrace. Republicans could become so split that none of the immigration bills ultimately will pass -- a dynamic that's already prevented Kobach from seeing legislative successes in his home state even as he helps lawmakers in others.\par \par \uc2 "It's an issue that kind of crosses unusual political lines," Brunk said.\par \par \uc2 The new program proposed by the business groups would create a pool of immigrant workers that businesses could tap after the state certifies a labor shortage in their industries. The state would support individual workers' requests from the federal government for authorization to continue working in the U.S., despite not being able to document that they are in the country legally.\par \par \uc2 The measure is designed to help commercial dairies and feedlots in western Kansas, as well as landscaping, roofing and some construction businesses.\par \par \uc2 Eric Stafford, a state chamber lobbyist, described the proposal as an alternative to "harmful" legislation that would hurt the economy -- a reference to the laws in Alabama and Arizona. Religious leaders called the business coalition's bill compassionate.\par \par \uc2 "This could be a model bill for other states to follow," Rep. Reynaldo Mesa, a Garden City Republican, said as he testified in favor of the measure. "This is not about amnesty. This is not about citizenship. This is about dealing with reality."\par \par \uc2 But Kobach said during an interview that the bill is an amnesty proposal because it would allow illegal immigrants to stay in Kansas. He said it makes little sense to direct them into hard-to-fill jobs when U.S. citizens who are out of work collect unemployment and benefits from the state.\par \par \uc2 "It seems to me we'd all be better off if these jobs went to U.S. citizens," Kobach said.\par \par \uc2 And some legislators want to pursue Alabama- or Arizona-style measures, arguing that their constituents are frustrated with the federal government's failure to check illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 Starting Wednesday, the committee will consider two bills that would require state and local government agencies and government contractors to use the federal e-Verify program to check the status of new workers.\par \par \uc2 A third measure would make it a crime to knowingly harbor an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  and require applicants for government assistance to provide proof that they're in the U.S. legally. A fourth bill would direct law enforcement officers to check the status of people they stop for other reasons if there is a "reasonable suspicion" that the people stopped may be in the U.S. illegally.\par \par \uc2 Kobach said such measures represent attempts by the state to ensure that existing laws on immigration are enforced. But Lalo Munoz, director of the Latino Information Network of Kansas, said the goal is to make life in Kansas "unbearable" so that illegal immigrants leave.\par \par \uc2 --------\par \par \uc2 The business coalition's proposal is HB 2712. The measures backed by Kobach and his allies are HBs 2492, 2576, 2577 and 2578.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Online:\par \par \uc2 Kansas Legislature: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.kslegislature.org"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.kslegislature.org}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120214e82e0007j\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

(AP) - Another defendant has been convicted in the execution-style killings of three Newark friends in 2007.\par \par \uc2 An Essex County jury found Jose Carranza guilty on three counts of felony murder and four counts of first-degree armed robbery.\par \par \uc2 But he was acquitted on three counts of murder and charges of attempted murder, sexual assault, conspiracy to commit robbery and conspiracy to commit murder. The sexual assault charge allegedly had been committed against a woman who survived the attack.\par \par \uc2 The verdict was returned Tuesday afternoon, a week after the jury got the case. Overall, the panel deliberated for about five days.\par \par \uc2 "If it were up to me he would have been convicted on all 19 counts but I respect the verdict of the jury," said Assistant County Prosecutor Romesh Sukhdeo.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SAN DIEGO (AP) - Gov. Jerry Brown outlined an optimistic political agenda for California Democrats at their party's annual convention Saturday, pitching his accomplishments and goals as he sidestepped an internal party squabble about whether Democrats should support his tax initiative or those being offered by two other Democratically-aligned groups.\par \par \uc2 Brown discussed high-speed rail, education reform and the Dream Act for \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  college students during an enthusiastic address in San Diego. He said Democrats are poised to capture a two-thirds majority in the state Senate and said he hopes they also can retake Congress.\par \par \uc2 He also promoted his aggressive stance on alternative energy, saying he will not be deterred by critics.\par \par \uc2 "We're going to keep innovating. We didn't get here by being conventional, status quo, doing what everybody does. California has been number one because we lead," Brown said to cheers.\par \par \uc2 Many were waving signs that said "We're With Jerry" -- an apparent reference to his November ballot proposal to raise the state's sales and income taxes temporarily to help fund education and local services. Brown has raised at least $2.2 million for the initiative and has begun a signature-drive to put it on the ballot, but he barely touched on the issue in his speech.\par \par \uc2 Brown told more than 2,000 Democrats they would "get your marching orders soon enough." He declined to answer reporters' questions after his speech.\par \par \uc2 Outside the convention center, about a dozen supporters of a ballot proposal that would raise the income tax rate on millionaires handed out pamphlets on the proposal and asked Democrats to join their signature drive. The California Federation of Teachers proposed that initiative and is supported by the powerful California Nurses Association.\par \par \uc2 "We're getting tons of support," said Kelly Mayhew, 47, an instructor at San Diego City College who was holding one of the petitions and handing out stickers supporting the proposal. "People are pretty fired up to do something. We're running a really positive campaign, and we feel really good about it."\par \par \uc2 A separate proposal by attorney Molly Munger, the daughter of a top executive with \uc2 Warren Buffett\uc2 's \uc2 Berkshire Hathaway Inc\uc2 ., is pushing a proposed initiative that would increase income taxes across-the-board on a sliding scale and raise $10 billion annually for 12 years. Her initiative is supported by the California Parent Teacher Association.\par \par \uc2 The three tax initiatives have been proposed to address California's chronic budget problems, which include a $9.2 billion deficit that lawmakers must close in the coming fiscal year.\par \par \uc2 They also have divided the Democratic Party's political support groups. For example, the state's largest teachers union, the California Teachers Association, supports Brown's plan, not the one offered by the smaller teachers union or the other one supported by the PTA.\par \par \uc2 Democrats returning from lunch also were greeted by a gauntlet of about 100 Occupy protesters who voiced various complaints and carried signs protesting military spending. They chanted "Don't just watch us, come and join us," and other slogans.\par \par \uc2 Many Democrats, some sporting buttons saying "We are the 99 Percent," stopped to chat with them.\par \par \uc2 Despite disagreement over the November tax initiatives and the protesters outside, California Democrats are in a buoyant mood this year.\par \par \uc2 They won every statewide office in 2010 and are expecting to gain more legislative and congressional seats this year.\par \par \uc2 An independent redistricting process has given the party the opportunity to gain a two-thirds majority in the state Senate, enough to raise taxes without Republican votes, and created a number of up-for-grabs seats in the nation's largest congressional delegation. Those include several seats Democrats think they can seize from Republicans.\par \par \uc2 House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi told the audience earlier Saturday that those California races will be central to the party's national strategy for regaining congressional seats they lost two years ago.\par \par \uc2 "Our state will prove critical to electing a Congress to work with our president instead of a Congress obstructing his every move," she said.\par \par \uc2 Pelosi said she expects California, Florida, Illinois, New York and Texas to leave the party only about a half-dozen seats short of a majority in the House. She declined to predict how many seats she anticipated picking up, saying only that she would be happy with the 25 needed to take control from Republicans.\par \par \uc2 California's congressional delegation now stands at 34 Democrats and 19 Republicans.\par \par \uc2 Daniel Scarpinato, a spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee, dismissed the Democratic leader's remarks, saying Americans already have rejected her leadership.\par \par \uc2 Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who is seeking re-election to a full fourth term this year, and other high-profile Democrats also addressed the convention on Saturday. They included state Attorney General Kamala Harris and Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120211e82b0003g\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 CHICAGO (AP) - After 11 people suspected of being in the country illegally were released from custody under a controversial county ordinance and then arrested again, the Cook County's sheriff suggested tweaking the ordinance so he could alert immigration officials when a violent offender was about to be freed.\par \par \uc2 At a county board meeting, Sheriff Tom Dart addressed critics' concerns that the provision forbidding the jail from notifying immigration officials when suspected immigrants are about to post bond, finish serving their sentences or have their cases dropped creates a public safety risk.\par \par \uc2 Dart, whose office runs the jail, suggested it be allowed to notify federal authorities when violent offenders are set for release so U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents can pick them up before they're freed.\par \par \uc2 The Chicago Sun-Times ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://bit.ly/zqwd16"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://bit.ly/zqwd16}}}\uc2 ) reported that the 148 inmates that the jail would have provided notification for if allowed include people charged with murder, sexual assault and other violent crimes.\par \par \uc2 "When you segregate out the violent acts on this, it should give everybody in the county reason to feel a lot more secure and safe," Dart told the board Thursday.\par \par \uc2 Since the ordinance was passed about five months ago, Dart said 346 people suspected of being in the U.S. illegally have walked out of jail, including one who was charged with aggravated battery of a police officer. The 11 who were released and arrested now face charges including theft, drunken driving and drug possession.\par \par \uc2 Dart previously sent the board letters about his concerns and a few weeks ago, the board referred an ordinance amendment to a committee that would allow the jail to notify immigration officials when it is about to release inmates charged with certain felonies and high-level drug charges or on a terrorist watch list.\par \par \uc2 Another amendment has been referred to committee that would give the sheriff to authority to decide whether or not to notify federal authorities when a suspected \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  is about to be released.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Information from: Chicago Sun-Times, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.suntimes.com/index"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.suntimes.com/index}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120210e82a001c8\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WICHITA, Kan. (AP) - The owner of a Kansas grocery store is pleading with a federal judge to spare him from prison for his role in a food stamp scam targeting poor people willing to sell their government benefits for cash.\par \par \uc2 "I have wronged myself and I have been audacious in my ignorance which lead to tremendous tribulations," Ajami Al-Maleki wrote in a letter to U.S. District Judge J. Thomas Marten seeking leniency.\par \par \uc2 The letter from Al-Maleki, the owner of Kansas Food Market, was included as part of a filing Wednesday by his defense attorney, Kurt Kerns, seeking a probationary sentence below the federal sentencing guidelines. Kerns portrayed the Iraqi immigrant as a devoted father of five who came to this country in 1996 and worked hard until he saved enough to open his Wichita grocery store in 2009.\par \par \uc2 The filing came just days before Al-Maleki's scheduled sentencing Monday on charges of conspiracy, wire fraud and food stamp fraud. On Thursday, prosecutors asked the court for a continuance to respond to the defense filing, saying it contained multiple issues and factual assertions not previously known to the government.\par \par \uc2 Assistant U.S. Attorney Brent Anderson said in an email Thursday that the government requested additional time because it appears the defense filing was incomplete and possibly inaccurate.\par \par \uc2 "We understand why Mr. Al-Maleki would attempt to obscure and minimize his role in the crimes to which he has pled guilty, but we hope our written response and arguments in court will present the full picture of Mr. Al-Maleki's defrauding of the food stamp program."\par \par \uc2 In his plea agreement, Al-Maleki admitted that between July and December of 2010, he entered into an agreement with Wally Mikhael Gaggo and others to defraud the Department of Agriculture by giving cash to recipients of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, commonly known as food stamps.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors said two small stores -- the Kansas Food Market and the Alnoor Grocery and Biryani House -- typically paid people 50 to 60 cents on the dollar for the value of the food stamps and pocketed the difference. Gaggo, the runner who was charged in both indictments, testified on behalf of the government and received probation at his sentencing last month.\par \par \uc2 Kerns downplayed in his filing his client's part in the food stamp scheme, calling Al-Maleki a "conduit" for the fraud rather than a leader of the conspiracy. Kerns tried to shift most of the blame to Gaggo, whom he contends gave Al-Maleki the idea to trade cash for food stamps.\par \par \uc2 In bolstering that argument, the defense cited testimony at a co-defendant's trial in which Gaggo admitted he defrauded the food stamp program with another Wichita grocery store at least a year before doing business with Al-Maleki.\par \par \uc2 In that testimony, Gaggo described his role as "the person in charge of all the food stamp fraud in Wichita. I was the one -- I was the main guy. I was the one to go after people and buy the food stamp card and go after them over 25 location and I have five people work for me to collect the food stamp and give it to me and ask to take them to the store."\par \par \uc2 Kerns also claimed it was Gaggo who decided Al-Maleki's share, which was always less than 20 percent. He included the results of a polygraph examination which purportedly show Al-Maleki was truthful when he acknowledged that in all his dealings with Gaggo he made less than $3,000 as his share of the fraud.\par \par \uc2 Two indictments filed last year accuse 13 people in a scheme that defrauded the government out of more than $580,000. The two food stamp-related indictments came after months of investigations involving undercover informants, surveillance of the stores and computerized detection systems.\par \par \uc2 Al-Maleki was indicted for fraudulently cashing $130,000 worth of food stamps in some 750 transactions involving at least 100 food stamp recipients. He pleaded guilty in August in a deal whereby the government agreed to dismiss other counts in the food stamp case as well as a separate indictment accusing him of knowingly hiring an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors also agreed to recommend a sentence at the low end of federal sentencing guidelines. The defense is now asking the judge to go below those guidelines with a probationary sentence.\par \par \uc2 The owners of the other Wichita grocery store, Alnoor Grocery and Biryani House, were both sentenced last month to prison. Muhammad Qadeer Akram got 18 months in prison while his wife, Shama Qadeer, received six months in prison plus six months of home confinement.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120209e829001yx\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The Topeka Capital-Journal, Feb. 5\par \par \uc2 Waiver program a bad idea\par \par \uc2 Kansas' farmers, ranchers and dairy and feedlot operators say they are having a difficult time finding sufficient employees among the pool of U.S. citizens and legal immigrant workers.\par \par \uc2 Given the nature of those businesses and the population base in rural areas where many of them are located, we don't doubt the need for labor. But creating a system through which illegal immigrants would be courted to fill the jobs isn't the way to solve the problem.\par \par \uc2 Kansas Agriculture Secretary Dale Rodman has asked the U.S. Department of Homeland Security for a waiver to establish a pilot program through which undocumented immigrants with no criminal background could be recruited by sponsor companies to fill their job openings.\par \par \uc2 If a waiver is granted -- which isn't a sure thing -- and the state establishes the employer-\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  network, the program would look for illegal immigrants who have been in Kansas a minimum of five years for the labor pool.\par \par \uc2 We support the state's agricultural industry and all those who toil to make it work. We don't endorse exempting it from the rules.\par \par \uc2 If nothing else, the system Rodman proposes documents this country's convoluted positions on illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 To oversimplify, on one hand are those who support nothing but rounding up all illegal immigrants and sending them home, thinking that will solve a problem and free jobs for citizens and legal immigrants. On the other hand are those who realize illegal immigrants come to the United States in search of work and will continue to enter the country -- and risk death doing so -- as long as they think they can find work here.\par \par \uc2 That huge contradiction, however, is a federal issue and should be solved at that level, uniformly. Granting a waiver for a specific industry in one state only muddies the immigration waters and lets the federal government further ignore its responsibility to deal with the problem in one way or another.\par \par \uc2 The fact work is available is evidenced by the clamors from the agricultural industry and the fact Rodman and others think illegal immigrants who are experienced workers and have been in Kansas five years can be found in sufficient numbers to help.\par \par \uc2 We're writing here about the agricultural industry and its labor problem, but in addition to the Kansas Farm Bureau, Kansas Livestock Association, Kansas Chamber of Commerce and some local chamber affiliates, supporters of Rodman's proposal also include building industry organizations.\par \par \uc2 And lest anyone forget, what Rodman, the organizations listed above and some legislators are supporting will be frowned upon by Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, who has invested a lot of his time in drafting laws for states where officials in the "round them up and send them home" camp are in the majority.\par \par \uc2 It wouldn't be a stretch to suggest that Kobach's beliefs and his current position play some role in the push to make some illegal immigrants not quite so illegal, and free to remain in the state and work openly.\par \par \uc2 Regardless, immigration is a federal issue to be handled at that level, not by a waiver or waivers to selected industries in selected states.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 The Hutchinson News, Feb. 3\par \par \uc2 Nonpolitical map\par \par \uc2 Senate takes stab at logical districts, but partisans cry foul, reveal agendas\par \par \uc2 Give credit to the Senate half of the Statehouse building in Topeka. Despite the expectation that redistricting would be a wholly partisan exercise, the Senate Reapportionment Committee has passed to its full chamber a nonpartisan map of new congressional district boundaries.\par \par \uc2 It is a good map - as good as any possible, that is. It puts Manhattan and Riley County into the Big First that already consumes two-thirds of the state's geography. But it gets all of Lawrence into a single district. And overall it makes sense, keeping areas of common interest together.\par \par \uc2 But to hear some partisans describe it, the map is an abomination.\par \par \uc2 Kansas Republican Party Chairwoman Amanda Adkins said the proposal "appears to be a coldly calculated attempt to create a Democrat 2nd Congressional District to the detriment of the dean of our congressional delegation."\par \par \uc2 Oh, yeah, the map does make the 2nd District 30 percent Democrat compared to 29 percent today. Calculating indeed.\par \par \uc2 And the "dean" of the congressional delegation, that would be Rep. Lynn Jenkins, who if she had her way she'd get rid of all of liberal-leaning Lawrence and push Wyandotte County on the Missouri border into the First District. The "dean," by the way is a three-year veteran of Congress in an otherwise freshman set of House members.\par \par \uc2 Just in case anyone thought that the Kansas Chamber of Commerce was a business advocacy group like your local chamber, the chairman of the state chamber's political action committee reminded everyone that it is an organ of the conservative wing of the Republican Party.\par \par \uc2 "This map hurts Republicans and helps President Obama's agenda. Just the latest example of why we need a new state Senate." Ivan Crossland said.\par \par \uc2 To the contrary, just when it appeared that the only way to take politics out of redistricting was to hand the job over to a nonpartisan commission, the Senate has shown remarkable leadership.\par \par \uc2 "It's as nonpolitical as we can make it," said Committee Chairman Tim Owens, a Republican from Overland Park.\par \par \uc2 Well done, sir.\par \par \uc2 --------\par \par \uc2 The Hays Daily News, Feb. 3\par \par \uc2 Medicaid reform\par \par \uc2 The pleas are many to slow down Gov. Sam Brownback's planned overhaul of the state's Medicaid program. Legislators from both sides of the aisle have suggested the timetable simply is too quick to effectively transfer management of the $2.9 billion program to private insurance companies. Advocates for the developmentally disabled remain unconvinced the so-called KanCare reforms will be the best for their clients.\par \par \uc2 While we wouldn't expect many of the 350,000 Kansans currently receiving health care through Medicaid to have lobbyists at the ready in Topeka, we suspect their words would fall on deaf ears as well.\par \par \uc2 The Brownback administration hasn't even heard back from the federal government whether a waiver will be granted to allow Kansas moving into a private managed-care program, yet it's full speed ahead. The governor is seeking three insurance companies to manage coverage of the state's poor, disabled and older citizens beginning Jan. 1, 2013.\par \par \uc2 When asked if such a massive restructuring could or should be delayed, Lt. Gov. Jeff Colyer said simply: "Why would we?"\par \par \uc2 Perhaps this week's announcement from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Kansas might provide an answer to that very question. The state's largest insurance company isn't even going to bid on the Medicaid contract.\par \par \uc2 "We decided that we could not responsibly commit to so great a change at this time," said BCBS director of institutional relations Angie Strecker.\par \par \uc2 This bears repeating: A company that already covers 880,000 Kansans, operates in all Kansas counties except two, and processed more than 16 million claims in 2010 worth more than $2 billion, doesn't believe it can responsibly change that quickly.\par \par \uc2 Were Blue Cross Blue Shield to enter the Medicaid side of things, critics easily could argue the company would obtain monopoly status. By abstaining from the bid process, such arguments won't need to take place.\par \par \uc2 BCBS' recognition there is not enough time to adequately plan such an enormous change in this critical health-care segment is laudable. We hope this implicit plea catches the ear of the Brownback administration. The governor's intention is good, as services could be improved and costs should be brought down. But if ever a fast track was not needed, this is the time. There is no need to jeopardize care for the state's most vulnerable populations.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 The Wichita Eagle, Feb. 1\par \par \uc2 Worthy ideas on arts\par \par \uc2 Anger lingers over Gov. Sam Brownback's one-man demolition of the Kansas Arts Commission, the resulting loss of $1.2 million in matching funds, and statewide fallout such as the shutdown of three arts councils and two arts academies. But it's time to acknowledge that the commission is gone - at least as Kansans knew it - and to find a way out of this fiasco. Some worthy ideas are emerging.\par \par \uc2 Last month Brownback made the constructive suggestion of combining the Kansas Arts Commission and the Kansas Film Commission into a new Creative Industries Commission within the Kansas Department of Commerce.\par \par \uc2 That approach has worked in other states, including Missouri and Colorado, so it should make Kansas eligible again to receive grants from the National Endowment for the Arts. Brownback's proposal also presents the welcome opportunity for the new commission to receive gaming and lottery proceeds, which the Commerce Department distributes via the $42 million Economic Development Initiatives Fund.\par \par \uc2 In any case, the state needs to do better than the $200,000 for the new commission in Brownback's 2013 budget blueprint. Not only is $200,000 a long way from the $815,000 accorded the arts in the fiscal 2011 budget, but the film commission gets $105,000 now. Kansas should invest more than $95,000 in its comeback as a state that supports the arts.\par \par \uc2 Under another arts option approved years ago but never implemented, Kansans will be able to pay extra for special license plates supporting the arts. And House Bill 2454, which has about 40 House sponsors, would add the arts to Meals on Wheels, breast cancer, military relief and wildlife (the "chickadee checkoff") as donation options on the Kansas individual income-tax form.\par \par \uc2 Though both programs would enable Kansans to show support for the arts, they won't satisfy the need for a steady and meaningful stream of state dollars. For example, the four existing tax-checkoff categories raised $415,511 last year. And as new ones are added, the old ones tend to lose revenue.\par \par \uc2 "We want Kansas to become a leader, an innovator, in creativity and creative industries, and we are in a position to do so," Kansas Arts Commission member Henry Schwaller IV told The Eagle editorial board this week.\par \par \uc2 Judging from the 5,000 e-mails, letters and calls urging the 2011 Legislature to save the commission and state funding for the arts, many Kansans feel likewise.\par \par \uc2 At least Brownback finally seems to have heard the message, too - if too late to save a state agency with a 45-year tradition of enriching Kansas' artistic activity and identity.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120207e827001tb\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) - A bill that allows anyone to file a complaint with the attorney general's office alleging a business is employing an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  was approved by a House panel on Monday.\par \par \uc2 Lawmakers voted to move forward with the bill, which requires the attorney general, county attorneys and local police to investigate the complaints. They backed the measure despite opposition from lobbyists and the attorney general's chief of staff.\par \par \uc2 Rep. Julian Garrett, R-Indianola, authored the bill, and said the goal is to create a deterrent for illegal workers. Verified complaints would be reported to federal immigration officials, and employers could lose their business licenses.\par \par \uc2 "What it will accomplish is as soon as it becomes known that it's Iowa law, the people that work here illegally won't even apply for jobs," Garrett said.\par \par \uc2 The bill also requires employers to use a federal electronic worker verification system. Rep. Gary Worthan, a Storm Lake Republican and chairman of the justice budget committee, said that's a good goal.\par \par \uc2 "You have businesses that are taking unfair advantage," said Worthan, who is co-sponsoring the measure. "If they're employing illegal immigrants, they have an advantage over businesses that are doing things correctly."\par \par \uc2 But Iowa Attorney General Chief of Staff Eric Tabor told lawmakers that it is not the role of state, county or local officials to enforce immigration law, and the attorney general's office would likely need more staff to cover the responsibilities outlined in the bill.\par \par \uc2 "What this bill does is imposes a substantial burden on the attorney general's office and the county attorney and presumably on police to do these investigations," Tabor said.\par \par \uc2 According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 17 states now require employers to use the e-verify system, including neighboring Missouri and Nebraska. Some states only require public employers and contractors to use the system. The free system was used more than 17 million times in the 2011 fiscal year by more than 300,000 employers, according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.\par \par \uc2 Ben Stone, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Iowa, said the verification system is flawed, as is the proposed legislation.\par \par \uc2 "It's really kind of a clumsy attempt to get the officers of the state of Iowa to get involved in enforcing immigration law, which is really the job of the federal government," Stone said.\par \par \uc2 And Adam Mason, state policy director for Iowa Citizens for Community Improvement, said the bill is reminiscent of controversial immigration laws in Arizona and Alabama. He also said the bill could lead to racial profiling.\par \par \uc2 "That's a huge concern for the Latino community who is here legally," Mason said.\par \par \uc2 Garrett noted the bill doesn't allow for claims based on race, color or national origin, and he doesn't believe the measure would put a strain on law enforcement.\par \par \uc2 Rep. Mary Wolfe, from Clinton, is one of a handful of Democrats co-sponsoring the legislation. She said several people in her community asked her to examine the situation, though she is unsure if it's the right solution.\par \par \uc2 "I think it's a good conversation to have," Wolfe said.\par \par \uc2 Mason said this is a unique instance where his group is likely aligned with industry and agriculture lobbyists in their concerns about the effects the measure may have on employers. But John Gilliland, a lobbyist for the Iowa Association of Business and Industry, said his group is undecided on the measure. A spokeswoman for the Iowa Farm Bureau didn't return a message.\par \par \uc2 Garrett believes the measure will gain approval, as a total of 38 Republicans and three Democrats in the House are co-sponsoring it. It then would move to the Senate, where Democrats hold a narrow majority.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120207e82700096\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Monday, February 6, 2012\par \par \uc2 Iowa woman accused of blackmailing TLC show\par \par \uc2 DAVENPORT, Iowa (AP) -- An Iowa woman is charged with extortion in an alleged plot to get \uc2 Discovery Communications Inc\uc2 . to cancel the TLC show "19 Kids and Counting" or pay her $10,000 in exchange for not revealing compromising photos of a cast member, according to federal court documents.\par \par \uc2 Teresa Hunt, of Bettendorf, is accused of threatening to release photos of a cast member in "apparently intimate situations" to a magazine.\par \par \uc2 Hunt was arrested Feb. 1 after she apparently sent television executives typed and handwritten letters demanding the show be canceled, along with a business card for "Perfect Pictures."\par \par \uc2 The reality show follows Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar and their 19 children.\par \par \uc2 The letter was sent in January to the parent company of LTC describing Hunt's professional relationship with a 56-year-old musician who performs in Branson, Mo., and providing details of an affair with an unspecified female cast member, according to an affidavit in U.S. District Court in Davenport.\par \par \uc2 Hunt's arrest was first reported last Thursday by the Quad-City Times in Davenport.\par \par \uc2 In the letter, Hunt allegedly said that the Duggars "claim to be so Christian so they keep popping out more babies to keep their ratings up."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Bill sets up \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  hiring reporting\par \par \uc2 DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Anyone could file a complaint with the Iowa attorney general's office alleging a business is employing an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  under a measure being discussed in the House.\par \par \uc2 Members of a subcommittee Monday will discuss the bill, which requires the attorney general, county attorneys and local police to investigate complaints.\par \par \uc2 Verified complaints would be reported to federal immigration officials, and employers could lose their business licenses.\par \par \uc2 The bill also requires employers to use a federal electronic worker verification system.\par \par \uc2 Supporters of the measure say it would level the playing field for businesses by rooting out illegal workers. Opponents say it amounts to racial profiling, could hurt businesses and would be a drain on law enforcement's time.\par \par \uc2 A total of 38 Republicans and three Democrats in the House are co-sponsoring the bill.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 China VP seeks reunion with Iowans he met in 1985\par \par \uc2 DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- When China's vice president comes to the United States next week, he'll clear time between stops in Washington and California to visit Iowa.\par \par \uc2 Vice President Xi Jinping, who is expected to become China's president in October, asked for a Wednesday stop in Des Moines and Muscatine, a Mississippi River town in southeast Iowa.\par \par \uc2 Xi, 58, has just one goal for his Muscatine visit -- to reconnect with the friends he made there 27 years ago as a young Communist Party leader of Hebei Province, an agriculture-rich region in northern China.\par \par \uc2 "He was professional, dignified, and I think he was grateful that he was warmly received and had kind words to say about the people who greeted him," said Sarah Lande, who is organizing the visit at the request of Gov. Terry Branstad.\par \par \uc2 Lande, 73, and her husband Roger, 74, were among several families to greet Xi in 1985 when he visited as part of an Iowa Sister State program that encouraged a stronger understanding between Iowa and Hebei Province. Xi stayed overnight in Muscatine with another couple and apparently has fond memories of his stay.\par \par \uc2 Sarah Lande said Xi requested that only the people he met during the previous visit be invited. Lande was executive director of Iowa's Sister State program for 12 years and has traveled to 29 countries, including four visits to China.\par \par \uc2 Branstad and Xi discussed the possibility for a return visit to Iowa during the governor's trade mission in September. Branstad called Lande to see if she could help coordinate. She is retired, but is an active community volunteer, and readily took the assignment to help.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Bath & Body Works\uc2  settles Iowa retaliation case\par \par \uc2 DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Bath & Body Works LLC has settled with the Iowa Civil Rights Commission on a retaliation complaint.\par \par \uc2 Former Des Moines store manager Penny Dittmer filed a complaint, alleging she was fired for her support of another \uc2 Bath & Body Works\uc2  employee.\par \par \uc2 Dittmer says she told her district manager that she would testify in the case of a black man who'd filed a bias complaint after a white woman was hired for a position he'd sought.\par \par \uc2 Dittmer says she later was fired for unsubstantiated reasons. She then filed her retaliation case.\par \par \uc2 Representatives for \uc2 Bath & Body Works\uc2  and its owner, \uc2 Limited Brands\uc2 , didn't return messages on Monday.\par \par \uc2 The commission says the agreement included an undisclosed financial settlement but not Dittmer's reinstatement.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Iowa appeals same-sex birth ruling\par \par \uc2 DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Iowa health officials said Monday they are appealing a Polk County court decision that orders the state to list both members of a same-sex marriage as the parents of a child who was born two years ago.\par \par \uc2 The January court ruling addressed children born to a lesbian mother who conceived through the use of an anonymous sperm donor. But it didn't address how cases of same-sex couples who conceive in other ways should be handled, and the Iowa Department of Public Health wants guidance about how to handle those cases, spokeswoman Polly Carver-Kimm said.\par \par \uc2 "IDPH is seeking further guidance from the Iowa Supreme Court regarding applying the presumption of paternity language currently in code to same-sex marriages," she said.\par \par \uc2 Heather and Melissa Gartner, of Des Moines, sued after the department listed only Heather as a parent, arguing that the move deprived their daughter of benefits of having two legal parents. Their lawyer, Sharon Malheiro, didn't return a telephone message Monday.\par \par \uc2 Attorney General Tom Miller's office filed a short notice with the court saying the agency "appeals to the Supreme Court of Iowa from the final ruling in this case on Jan. 4, 2012."\par \par \uc2 Carver-Kimm said the agency was merely seeking guidance on how to handle cases that are similar, but not precisely the same.\par \par \uc2 The Supreme Court has stirred controversy in the past dealing with gay rights issues. It issued a 2009 decision striking down a state law defining marriage as being between one man and one woman. That led to an outcry by conservatives that saw three members of the court voted out of office in the last election.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120206e826002c9\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 STEINS, N.M. (AP) - Seven months after 68-year-old Larry Link was gunned down in the dusty expanse of the ghost town he owned and where he once hosted tourists, his murder remains unsolved.\par \par \uc2 Speculation about the killing -- Link was shot five times, his scalp was lacerated and his chest and stomach were bruised -- from neighbors and family members ranges from Mexican drug cartels to a random stranger, who might have happened across the collection of dilapidated clapboard, rock and log buildings that is Steins from nearby Interstate 10.\par \par \uc2 The investigation has stalled, with New Mexico State Police asking the public for help.\par \par \uc2 Authorities believe Link's death might have been a robbery gone wrong. A semi-trailer used for storage on the property appeared to have been broken into, with items from inside strewn on the ground.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, family members have announced that they will reopen the Steins Railroad Ghost Town for tours in May. The curious will be able to experience what was once a bustling mining and railroad town, which survived on water freighted in by the Southern Pacific, had competing bordellos and, most recently, a very modern episode of Old West violence.\par \par \uc2 Steins is located in far southwest New Mexico, atop the state's Bootheel, where nearby residents have long worried about drug trafficking and its related violence. The U.S. Border Patrol has recently stepped up its presence in the isolated and rugged region.\par \par \uc2 Rancher Judy Keeler said she and other area residents believe Link's murder was likely connected to drug traffickers passing through. She said in recent years neighbors have been victims of break-ins, have seen requests jump for food and water by passing migrants, and at times have been nearly run off county roads by high-speed chases between the Border Patrol and suspected traffickers.\par \par \uc2 Ranchers and authorities say it's not uncommon to stumble upon lost bundles of marijuana and wandering traffickers, "drug mules," as they attempt to make it through the Peloncillo Mountains along the Arizona-New Mexico border.\par \par \uc2 In June, Link's body was found lying near his vehicle between his property and the Union Pacific Railroad easement in Steins. His son discovered a small-caliber revolver believed by police to be the murder weapon not too far off the property.\par \par \uc2 The autopsy report said Link suffered gunshot wounds to the heart, shoulder, arm and back.\par \par \uc2 "Sadly, it wasn't a surprise when he was killed," said Keeler. "But it got people scared and they wanted the Border Patrol to do something."\par \par \uc2 Before Link's death, Keeler said area ranchers were on edge with the shooting death of Arizona rancher Robert Krentz, 58, whose 35,000-acre spread is not far from the Bootheel. His murder also remains unsolved, but authorities say they suspect drug traffickers or illegal immigrants. Krentz's death sparked a surge in gun sales in the region.\par \par \uc2 Keeler described Link as very involved civic citizen who was always promoting tourism in Lordsburg, a town just east of Steins.\par \par \uc2 In 1988, Link and his wife bought Steins Railroad Ghost Town joining a number of Old West aficionados who sought to make once-bustling towns into tourist attractions. They offered tours, and even allowed ghost chasers to search the property for spirits.\par \par \uc2 Before that, Link ran a rattlesnake farm and had worked as a butcher and in the grocery business in Arizona.\par \par \uc2 Steins, once populated with 1,300 people, was largely abandoned by the-mid 1940s after the railroad stopped delivering water. Located about 80 miles north of Mexico in New Mexico's Hidalgo County, Steins is among many ghost towns, managed publically and privately, that dot the southern New Mexico landscape..\par \par \uc2 State police and the U.S. Border Patrol have said local opinions about Link's death are purely speculative. Link's daughter, Pamela, told the Las Cruces Sun-News that said she didn't believe that her father died at the hands of an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  since migrants typically just want food, water or a ride.\par \par \uc2 She also said she didn't believe the motive was robbery because her father's wallet was on the nightstand of his house in Steins. She said he had no enemies.\par \par \uc2 Meira Gault, 62, who along with her husband, Stephen, 71, operates a 20,000 acre ranch south of Steins, said it's hard to pin Link's death solely on drug traffickers or illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 "That area also gets a lot of traffic from California, Arizona and Texas," she said. "A lot of strange characters pass through there."\par \par \uc2 An email and phone call to the Link family was not returned. However, Link's granddaughter, Melissa Lamoree, recently wrote on a popular ghost town website that Steins was going to reopen.\par \par \uc2 "I am not sure if you heard but my grandfather (Larry Link) was murdered here on the property the morning of June 7th," Lamoree wrote. "It has been a horrible nightmare every day, but his passion was the town and being able to share the history with all the people that came. We want to share that with people again."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Follow Russell Contreras on twitter at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://twitter.com/russcontreras"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://twitter.com/russcontreras}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120205e825001pt\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

CALDWELL and LINDA STEWART BALL   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 1,059 \uc2 words\par \uc2 3 February 2012\par 20:29\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2012.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 DALLAS (AP) - A Dallas teenager who was deported to South America under a false name never expressed concern during jailhouse phone calls that she was being misidentified as an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Colombia.\par \par \uc2 The more than two dozen recorded telephone calls reviewed by The Associated Press show 15-year-old Jakadrien Turner expected to be deported to Colombia yet did not complain of having no ties to the country.\par \par \uc2 Instead, during several conversations she had with two men she identified herself as Tika Lanay Cortez and discussed renewing her green card and having her passport and Colombian identification card sent to authorities.\par \par \uc2 Yet, Turner claimed in a recent TV interview that she repeatedly tried to convince authorities she had lied when she initially identified herself to Houston police as Cortez, a 21-year-old Colombian national, after being arrested for shoplifting.\par \par \uc2 "At a certain point, I just gave up because I said it multiple times: `I'm Jakadrien Turner, I'm 15 years old, and why am I here?'" Turner, who was returned to Texas last month, told Dallas television station WFAA, in an interview that aired Wednesday night.\par \par \uc2 The Associated Press reviewed recordings of 25 telephone calls Turner made while in custody in Houston in April and May. A law enforcement official who has listened to most of the calls and has been briefed on the case confirmed the caller is Turner. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because the official is not authorized to publicly discuss details of the case.\par \par \uc2 During several of the phone calls, which ranged from a couple minutes to about 45 minutes, Turner frequently discusses having her passport and other documents sent so she could be released.\par \par \uc2 The teen, who said she ran away from home in November 2010 because her parents were strict, told the TV station she fell in with a trafficker who claimed to love her but threatened to kill her and hurt her family if she tried to leave.\par \par \uc2 Her Dallas attorney, Ray Jackson, told the Associated Press on Friday that the individuals Turner was calling on the phone were people she met after she escaped the trafficker -- in the week or two before her arrest.\par \par \uc2 One of them may have had family in Colombia, he said, explaining the South American connection.\par \par \uc2 "Essentially, what she's trying to do is get them to help her get out," Jackson said. "The purpose of the calls, some of them, was to try to get bond money.\par \par \uc2 "She wasn't going to call them and say, `Hey, guess what? I'm a 15-year-old girl." She continued using Tika Cortez, the name she made up, because that was how they knew her, he said, adding that she was resigned to the fact that she might be deported and felt hopeless.\par \par \uc2 "You've got to keep in mind that we're still dealing with a 15-year-old girl," Jackson said. "She was a month from being 14. So you're talking about someone who is very immature mentally. So she was confused by that whole situation."\par \par \uc2 Jackson said Turner endured some "horrific things" as a runaway, physically and mentally abused by the trafficker.\par \par \uc2 But after she was in custody -- and supposedly free of the trafficker -- she continued using her alias, said an attorney who represented her in the theft case.\par \par \uc2 "As far as I can tell, she was always listed as Tika Cortez," said William Rene McLellan, her Houston defense attorney.\par \par \uc2 McLellan said that given the pretrial proceedings and that she was told of the immigration hold, "there was ample opportunity for her to change her story. It's mind-boggling she would go with it."\par \par \uc2 McLellan noted Turner pleaded guilty, was sentenced to eight days with three days' credit and turned over to immigration.\par \par \uc2 Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials say Turner never identified herself as an American citizen.\par \par \uc2 Though there are times in the recorded jailhouse phone calls when Turner laments being incarcerated, she is generally upbeat and often jokes with the two men.\par \par \uc2 In a lengthy call April 9 with one of the men, Turner tells him she expects to be deported to Colombia but if she does go, "I'm coming back."\par \par \uc2 She never tells the man she is a U.S. citizen or complains that she has no ties to Colombia. The only thing she complains about is the security situation in that country.\par \par \uc2 "So this is what scares me though ... if I get deported, basically I don't know how I am going to go to Colombia because it's a war zone," she says.\par \par \uc2 Turner was sent to South America, where she remained until Jan. 6, after Dallas police, working with her grandmother, tracked her down using her \uc2 Facebook\uc2  page.\par \par \uc2 WFAA reported she was afraid that if she told the truth in Colombia that she would be imprisoned there.\par \par \uc2 "I made a lot of horrible mistakes, did a lot of things I'm not proud of," she told the station.\par \par \uc2 Turner says no one in Houston would believe her when she did tell the truth about who she was.\par \par \uc2 "It's like the story of the boy that cried wolf," Turner said. "I've lied multiple times before. I've never been honest. I've made a lot of stories up. I made the name up `Tika Cortez.'"\par \par \uc2 Jackson said he is planning to file a wrongful deportation lawsuit for a violation of Turner's constitutional rights, possibly against the Houston Police Department, ICE, Homeland Security and Colombia.\par \par \uc2 U.S. immigration officials insist they followed procedure and found nothing to indicate that the girl wasn't a Colombian woman living illegally in the country.\par \par \uc2 Turner was issued travel documents at the request of U.S. officials using information they provided, the Colombian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said.\par \par \uc2 Turner implies that both she and U.S. authorities are to blame.\par \par \uc2 "I think a lot of people say things to try to cover themselves up," she said. "I made the choices I made, and officials, they made the choices they made."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Alicia Caldwell reported from Washington, D.C.

CALDWELL and LINDA STEWART BALL   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 965 \uc2 words\par \uc2 3 February 2012\par 15:23\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2012.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 DALLAS (AP) - A Dallas teenager who was deported to South America under a false name never expressed concern during jailhouse phone calls that she was being misidentified as an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Colombia.\par \par \uc2 The more than two dozen recorded telephone calls reviewed by The Associated Press show 15-year-old Jakadrien Turner expected to be deported to Colombia yet did not complain of having no ties to the country.\par \par \uc2 Instead, during several conversations she had with two men she identified herself as Tika Lanay Cortez and discussed renewing her green card and having her passport and Colombian identification card sent to authorities.\par \par \uc2 Yet, Turner claimed in a recent TV interview that she repeatedly tried to convince authorities she had lied when she initially identified herself to Houston police as Cortez, a 21-year-old Colombian national, after being arrested for shoplifting.\par \par \uc2 "At a certain point, I just gave up because I said it multiple times: `I'm Jakadrien Turner, I'm 15 years old, and why am I here?'" Turner, who was returned to Texas last month, told Dallas television station WFAA, in an interview that aired Wednesday night.\par \par \uc2 The Associated Press reviewed recordings of 25 telephone calls Turner made while in custody in Houston in April and May. A law enforcement official who has listened to most of the calls and has been briefed on the case confirmed the caller is Turner. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because the official is not authorized to publicly discuss details of the case.\par \par \uc2 During several of the phone calls, which ranged from a couple minutes to about 45 minutes, Turner frequently discusses having her passport and other documents sent so she could be released.\par \par \uc2 The teen, who said she ran away from home in November 2010 because her parents were strict, told the TV station she fell in with a trafficker who she said claimed to love her and threatened to kill her and hurt her family if she tried to escape.\par \par \uc2 But after she was in custody -- and supposedly free of the alleged trafficker -- she continued using her alias, said the attorney who represented her in the theft case.\par \par \uc2 "As far as I can tell, she was always listed as Tika Cortez," said William Rene McLellan, her Houston defense attorney.\par \par \uc2 McLellan said that given the pretrial proceedings and that she was told of the immigration hold, "there was ample opportunity for her to change her story. It's mind-boggling she would go with it."\par \par \uc2 In addition to sticking to her fake name, he said, she also gave an address in Colombia.\par \par \uc2 McLellan noted Turner chose to plead guilty, was sentenced to eight days with three days' credit but then was turned over to federal officials because of the immigration hold.\par \par \uc2 Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials say Turner never identified herself as an American citizen.\par \par \uc2 Though there are times in the recorded jailhouse phone calls when Turner laments being incarcerated, she is generally upbeat and often jokes with the two men.\par \par \uc2 In a lengthy call April 9 with one of the men, Turner tells him she expects to be deported to Colombia but if she does go, "I'm coming back."\par \par \uc2 She never tells the man she is a U.S. citizen or complains that she has no ties to Colombia. The only thing she complains about is the security situation in that country.\par \par \uc2 "So this is what scares me though ... if I get deported, basically I don't know how I am going to go to Colombia because it's a war zone," she says.\par \par \uc2 Turner was sent to South America, where she remained until Jan. 6, after Dallas police, working with her grandmother, tracked her down.\par \par \uc2 Turner's mother has declined repeated interview requests by The Associated Press and messages left with her Dallas attorney were not returned.\par \par \uc2 While in Colombia, Turner's \uc2 Facebook\uc2  page, which a Dallas police detective used to locate her, include months' worth of posts that indicate she was having difficulty adjusting to life outside the United States.\par \par \uc2 One of her first posts, three days after her May 23 deportation, says, "I MISS HOUSTON...., Colombia is my home always..."\par \par \uc2 WFAA reported she was afraid that if she told the truth in Colombia that she would be imprisoned there.\par \par \uc2 "I made a lot of horrible mistakes, did a lot of things I'm not proud of," she told the station.\par \par \uc2 Turner says no one in Houston would believe her when she did tell the truth about who she was.\par \par \uc2 "It's like the story of the boy that cried wolf," Turner said. "I've lied multiple times before. I've never been honest. I've made a lot of stories up. I made the name up `Tika Cortez.'"\par \par \uc2 U.S. immigration officials insist they followed procedure and found nothing to indicate that the girl wasn't a Colombian woman living illegally in the country.\par \par \uc2 Turner was issued travel documents at the request of U.S. officials using information they provided, the Colombian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said.\par \par \uc2 According to that office, the girl was enrolled in the country's "Welcome Home" program after she arrived there. She was given shelter, psychological assistance and a job at a call center, the agency said.\par \par \uc2 Turner implies that both she and U.S. authorities are to blame.\par \par \uc2 "I think a lot of people say things to try to cover themselves up," she said. "I made the choices I made, and officials, they made the choices they made."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Alicia Caldwell reported from Washington, D.C.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) - Rhode Island lawmakers are headed for a showdown over a new policy giving illegal immigrants in-state tuition rates at state universities.\par \par \uc2 Legislation to reverse the tuition break has been introduced by critics who say a state education board was wrong to approve the policy without legislative consent.\par \par \uc2 But supporters of the idea have filed bills of their own to make the policy state law, meaning it would be more difficult to rescind.\par \par \uc2 A state higher education commission approved the tuition break last fall. It's available to immigrants who attend and graduate from a local high school and commit to seeking legal status.\par \par \uc2 State Sen. Juan Pichardo pushed for years to get lawmakers to approve the policy. He said it's important to make it state law to ensure that a future commission doesn't reverse the policy.\par \par \uc2 Pichardo, D-Providence, said people brought to the U.S. illegally as children should get the same shot at higher education as other Rhode Island students.\par \par \uc2 "These kids who are here through no fault of their own deserve that opportunity," he said.\par \par \uc2 But several of Pichardo's colleagues call the policy discriminatory and unfair, saying it gives illegal immigrants an advantage over out-of-state U.S. citizens. Their legislation would rescind the policy and prohibit the state from giving in-state tuition to illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 "We're rewarding people who are undocumented," said Sen. Nicholas Kettle, R-Coventry, one of the lawmakers signed on the bill. "And the way it was done was wrong. It should have gone through the General Assembly."\par \par \uc2 Gov. Lincoln Chafee, an independent, supports the tuition policy.\par \par \uc2 Twelve states have similar rules giving in-state tuition to illegal immigrants, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\par \par \uc2 Both bills await committee hearings and no votes are presently scheduled.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120202e822001vz\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 CONCORD, N.H. (AP) - Students at New Hampshire's public colleges who are illegal immigrants would have to pay higher out-of-state tuition rates under a bill passed by the House on Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 The House voted 250-88 in favor of legislation to require in-state students to prove they are also legal residents of the United States. The state would also have to establish a system to prove students are in the country legally to receive in-state tuition. The bill now goes to the Senate.\par \par \uc2 In a legislative analysis written for the Republican majority on the House Education Committee, supporters of the bill said the burden would be upon the applicant to prove his or her citizenship. The rules would require the same signed affidavit and documentation process applicants use to prove state residency.\par \par \uc2 Opponents, led by Democratic Rep. Mary Stuart Gile of Concord, said no one had testified during the committee's hearing on the bill to indicate this was a problem in the University System of New Hampshire.\par \par \uc2 Republican Rep. Ralph Bohem, of Litchfield, disputed their logic as "faulty."\par \par \uc2 "If no one checks, how would they know if there's a problem?" Bohem asked.\par \par \uc2 Bohem said illegal immigrants cannot be considered New Hampshire residents and should not receive in-state tuition.\par \par \uc2 Opponents argued any child who grew up in New Hampshire and graduated from its schools should be afforded in-state tuition. It was not the state's responsibility to enforce immigration laws, they said, which are the federal government's responsibility.\par \par \uc2 In the case a student was found to be an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , Gile, a native of Canada and a naturalized American, said she hopes the university would work with the student in the naturalization process and continue providing them in-state tuition rates.\par \par \uc2 "The ultimate goal should be to recognize these students were working to create a better life for themselves," said Gile.\par \par \uc2 The university system comprises four schools: the University of New Hampshire, Plymouth State University, Keene State College and Granite State College. The system enrolls more than 29,000 undergraduate and graduate students, but it is unclear how many would be affected if the tuition legislation becomes law.\par \par \uc2 In-state tuition rates at the system's four schools range from $275 per credit hour at Granite State College to $12,060 a year at the University of New Hampshire, while out-of-state rates range from $285 per credit hour at Granite State to $25,380 annually at UNH.\par \par \uc2 To qualify for in-state tuition rates under current policy, students only need to prove they have lived in New Hampshire for at least 12 months prior to registering.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120201e821001pf\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ATLANTA (AP) - A legislative committee chairman said Tuesday he's gotten about a thousand emails and a thousand phone calls on a bill to bar illegal immigrants from attending Georgia's state colleges, universities and technical schools and wants more time to consider differing viewpoints before allowing any vote.\par \par \uc2 House Higher Education Committee Rep. Carl Rogers, R-Gainesville, said after a committee meeting that he wants to consider communications from constituents and consult with the university system and the bill's sponsor. He anticipates a vote in two or three weeks.\par \par \uc2 The legislation would bar illegal immigrants from all 35 of Georgia's state colleges and universities, as well as the state's 25 technical schools. It passed out of the same committee last year but never made it to the House floor for a full vote. Rep. Tom Rice, R-Norcross, said the bill was pushed off until this year because the focus last year was on a broader, comprehensive crackdown on illegal immigration that passed and was signed into law.\par \par \uc2 The intent of the bill is to clarify the fact that postsecondary education is a public benefit and, consequently, should not be available to those who are in the country illegally, Rice said.\par \par \uc2 "Any situation in which there's a possibility of limiting the access for a Georgia citizen or a Georgia student to the university system in my estimation, and in what this bill says, ought to be restricted by the laws of Georgia," he said.\par \par \uc2 University system Chancellor Hank Huckaby told the committee that he does not believe the legislation is necessary, adding current board policy is sufficient.\par \par \uc2 "Even for those who are here through no fault of their own, it makes sense to me that we should educate them to the highest level possible," he said. "It helps our state economically, culturally, and educationally."\par \par \uc2 Technical College System of Georgia Commissioner Ronald Jackson echoed the chancellor's sentiments.\par \par \uc2 Already, illegal immigrants are effectively barred from the most competitive state schools by an October 2010 Board of Regents policy that prohibits any school that has rejected academically qualified applicants in the previous two years from accepting illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 That includes five Georgia colleges and universities: the University of Georgia, Georgia Tech, Georgia State University, Georgia Health Sciences University and Georgia College & State University. Illegal immigrants may still be admitted to any other state college or university, provided that they pay out-of-state tuition.\par \par \uc2 The Regents conducted a study in summer 2010 amid public concerns that Georgia state colleges and universities were being overrun by illegal immigrants, that taxpayers were subsidizing their education and legal residents were being displaced. It found that less than 1 percent of the state's public college students were illegal immigrants, and that students who pay out-of-state tuition more than pay for their education.\par \par \uc2 The committee heard testimony from a long list of people, most of whom opposed the bill.\par \par \uc2 Keish Kim, 20, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Korea who lives in Roswell, told the committee she graduated from high school in 2009 and was accepted to several of the state's most competitive schools, but couldn't attend them because her family couldn't afford out-of-state tuition.\par \par \uc2 "I was very afraid and I was very upset because I just wanted to learn," she said in emotional testimony, adding that she watched her dreams of becoming a lawyer "fall to the ground."\par \par \uc2 Advocates both for and against the legislation had been urging their supporters to call and email members of the committee to voice their opinions ahead of Tuesday's meeting. A row of young people wearing a red fabric letter "U" for "undocumented" pinned to their chests lined the back of the hearing room to protest the legislation. When Rogers asked for a show of hands of people who oppose the bill, almost every hand in the packed hearing room went up.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120201e82100079\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

(AP) - A study released Tuesday says Alabama's new immigration law -- which is called the toughest in the country -- will cost the state billions of dollars because of income lost by illegal immigrants who will have to leave, lost tax income and related costs.\par \par \uc2 The report by the Center for Business and Economic Research at the University of Alabama would cause 70,000 to 140,000 illegal immigrants to lose jobs and would cost about $1.2 billion to $5.8 billion in the earnings of those immigrants as well as $56.7 million to $264.5 million in lost state income taxes and sales taxes.\par \par \uc2 "The cost is quite certain," said the center's director, Sam Addy. "It's simple economics. If you have more people you have a bigger economy, less people a smaller economy."\par \par \uc2 A sponsor of the immigration bill, Republican Rep. Micky Hammon of Decatur, disputed the report.\par \par \uc2 "It's clear the study overestimates the negative and underestimates the positive to skew the result toward an agenda. If 40,000 illegal workers leave the state, they free up jobs that homegrown Alabamians are happy to have," he said.\par \par \uc2 Hammon said the state's lower unemployment rate proves the immigration bill is working.\par \par \uc2 "It doesn't take a PhD to see that since the law was signed unemployment has dropped from 10 percent to 8.1 percent. In Marshall County, once a known hotbed for illegal immigration, unemployment has plunged from 10 percent in June to 6.9 percent last month," Hammon said.\par \par \uc2 Statewide, the unemployment rate has dropped from 9.3 percent to 8.1 percent since January, 2011.\par \par \uc2 The report found that the economic costs of the new law outweigh the benefits. The report listed benefits of the new law and saving state funds used to provide benefits to illegal immigrants and making more employment opportunities available to legal residents. But the report said the costs to the state include hurting the state's economic development effort and the cost of implementing and enforcing the law.\par \par \uc2 Workers who leave will not be replaced by high salaried workers and will not be a big boost to the economy, said Addy, a U.S. citizen who came from the west African country of Ghana in 1989.\par \par \uc2 The sponsor of the bill in the Senate, Sen. Scott Beason, R-Gardendale, said the study does not take into account that many immigrant workers send much of what the earn to family members back home.\par \par \uc2 "It's our understanding that a tremendous amount goes out of state," Beason said,\par \par \uc2 The study estimates that 20 percent of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  workers "send their earnings to their home countries."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120201e8210004e\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) - An architect of state and local laws cracking down on illegal immigration is a leading Republican officeholder in Kansas, but business groups in his home state are asking legislators to move in the opposite direction by starting an unusual program designed to give illegal immigrants hard-to-fill jobs.\par \par \uc2 Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, a former law professor who helped draft tough laws against illegal immigration in Alabama and Arizona, criticized the new Kansas proposal Tuesday as "amnesty" for people who've come to the U.S. illegally. A spokeswoman said Gov. Sam Brownback, a fellow Republican, isn't supporting the measure.\par \par \uc2 But Brownback's agriculture secretary has acknowledged having several conversations with federal homeland security officials about potential labor shortages. The coalition pushing the new program includes agriculture groups with memberships that traditionally lean toward the GOP, as well as the Kansas Chamber of Commerce, another stalwart supporter of conservative Republicans.\par \par \uc2 Utah has a guest worker program, but it isn't set to start until January 2013, and its enactment was part of a legislative package that included initiatives in line with Kobach's thinking on immigration. States with large populations of illegal immigrants -- including California, Florida and Texas -- don't have their own programs.\par \par \uc2 It would be "unprecedented" if Kansas implemented the program proposed by its business groups, said Wendy Sefsaf, spokeswoman for the Washington-based Immigration Policy Center. She said she is skeptical that the federal government would allow such a program, though she's sympathetic toward its goals.\par \par \uc2 "Maybe it's a good thing to have a counterbalance to Kris Kobach," she said.\par \par \uc2 The new proposal complicates the debate over immigration in Kansas where, ironically, Kobach and his allies in the GOP-controlled Legislature haven't been able to pass the same tough measures enacted in other states. It also could split Republican majorities enough that nothing of either stripe passes in an election year.\par \par \uc2 Kobach said he doesn't see the business groups' proposals as a poke at him but rather as confirmation that some employers want to keep hiring illegal immigrants to suppress wages. He also said they're out of touch with legislators and Kansas voters.\par \par \uc2 "Their bill is a legal impossibility and a political fantasy," he said. "I don't take it personally at all."\par \par \uc2 The new program proposed by the groups would create a pool of immigrant workers that businesses could tap after the state certifies a labor shortage in their industries. The state would support requests from individual workers for the federal government to authorize them to continue working in the U.S., despite not being able to document that they are in the country legally.\par \par \uc2 Representatives of the groups pushing the plan provided a draft of legislation to The Associated Press ahead of its formal introduction in the House and Senate. The program would apply to illegal immigrants in the U.S. at least five years, if they've committed no felonies and not more than one misdemeanor, and if they agree to work at becoming proficient in English. Businesses hiring the immigrants would have to follow federal labor laws.\par \par \uc2 The Washington-based Pew Hispanic Center estimates that Kansas had 45,000 \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  workers in 2010, accounting for about 3 percent of its workforce. State officials and supporters of the business groups' plan don't yet have hard numbers on how many jobs are in danger of going unfilled, but unemployment rates in the western half of the state were mostly less than 4 percent in December, well below the statewide figure of 5.9 percent.\par \par \uc2 Backers of the proposal believe their new program would be helpful to commercial dairies and feedlots in western Kansas, as well as landscaping, roofing and some construction businesses.\par \par \uc2 "The key is, these are people that are in Kansas," said Allie Devine, a Topeka attorney and former state agriculture secretary who lobbies for business owners on immigration policy. "We're asking to keep those people here, let them remain and let them work."\par \par \uc2 Utah legislators created their state's guest-worker program last year, and Georgia legislators directed their state to study the idea. There were two unsuccessful proposals last year in Texas, and lawmakers are pursuing the idea in California, New Mexico and Oklahoma.\par \par \uc2 Sefsaf predicted the federal government will block such efforts, just as it has tried to block laws like Alabama's and Arizona's, as encroaching on its power to set national immigration policy. Kobach agreed.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, some signals from Brownback's administration on immigration issues have been mixed -- perhaps reflecting the split among key groups of supporters.\par \par \uc2 A new policy imposed Oct. 1 by the state Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services reduced or denied food stamps benefits to hundreds of U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 But last week, state Agriculture Secretary Dale Rodman publicly discussed the possibility of getting a waiver from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to allow agriculture businesses to hire illegal immigrants in jobs they're having trouble filling.\par \par \uc2 Department of Agriculture spokeswoman Chelsea Good said Tuesday that while Rodman has spoken several times with federal officials about labor problems in agriculture, the agency hasn't submitted a formal waiver request. The coalition's representatives said their proposal would make a waiver unnecessary.\par \par \uc2 Brownback spokeswoman Sherriene Jones-Sontag said the business groups' plan is not on the governor's legislative agenda, but it's still expected to get a hearing from legislators -- alongside proposals pursued by Kobach's allies.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Kansas Legislature: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.kslegislature.org"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.kslegislature.org}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120201e8210003g\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ATLANTA (AP) - A legislative committee in Georgia held a hearing Tuesday on a bill that would bar illegal immigrants from attending its state colleges, universities and technical schools, but the chairman delayed a vote on the measure.\par \par \uc2 The legislation would bar illegal immigrants from all 35 of Georgia's state colleges and universities, as well as the state's 25 technical schools. It passed out of the same committee last year but never made it to the House floor for a full vote. Rep. Tom Rice, R-Norcross, said the bill was pushed off until this year because the focus last year was on a broader, comprehensive crackdown on illegal immigration that passed and was signed into law by the governor.\par \par \uc2 House Higher Education Committee Chairman Rep. Carl Rogers, R-Gainesville, said he wants more time to consider about 1,000 emails and 1,000 phone calls he received on the topic and to consult with the university system and the bill's sponsor before bringing it up for a vote. He said he anticipates a vote in two or three weeks.\par \par \uc2 The intent of the bill is to clarify the fact that postsecondary education is a public benefit and therefore should not be available to people who are in the country illegally, Rice said.\par \par \uc2 "Any situation in which there's a possibility of limiting the access for a Georgia citizen or a Georgia student to the university system in my estimation, and in what this bill says, ought to be restricted by the laws of Georgia," he said.\par \par \uc2 University system Chancellor Hank Huckaby told the committee that he does not believe the legislation is necessary, that the current board policy is sufficient.\par \par \uc2 "Even for those who are here through no fault of their own, it makes sense to me that we should educate them to the highest level possible," he said. "It helps our state economically, culturally, and educationally."\par \par \uc2 Technical College System of Georgia Commissioner Ronald Jackson echoed the chancellor's sentiments.\par \par \uc2 Already, illegal immigrants are effectively barred from the most competitive state schools by an October 2010 Board of Regents policy that bars any school that has rejected academically qualified applicants in the previous two years from accepting illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 That includes five Georgia colleges and universities: the University of Georgia, Georgia Tech, Georgia State University, Georgia Health Sciences University and Georgia College & State University. Illegal immigrants may still be admitted to any other state college or university, provided that they pay out-of-state tuition.\par \par \uc2 The Regents conducted a study in summer 2010 amid public concerns that Georgia state colleges and universities were being overrun by illegal immigrants, that taxpayers were subsidizing their education and legal residents were being displaced. It found that less than 1 percent of the state's public college students were illegal immigrants, and that students who pay out-of-state tuition more than pay for their education.\par \par \uc2 The committee heard testimony from a long list of people, most of whom opposed the bill.\par \par \uc2 Keish Kim, 20, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Korea who lives in Roswell, told the committee she graduated from high school in 2009 and was accepted to several of the state's most competitive schools, but couldn't attend them because her family couldn't afford out-of-state tuition.\par \par \uc2 "I was very afraid and I was very upset because I just wanted to learn," she said in emotional testimony, adding that she watched her dreams of becoming a lawyer "fall to the ground."\par \par \uc2 Advocates both for and against the legislation had been urging their supporters to call and email members of the committee to voice their opinions ahead of Tuesday's meeting. A row of young people wearing a red fabric letter "U" for "undocumented" pinned to their chests lined the back of the hearing room to protest the legislation. When Rogers asked for a show of hands of people who oppose the bill, almost every hand in the packed hearing room went up.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120131e81v0029q\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

(AP) - A top Kansas social services official argued Monday that a new policy reducing or denying food stamps to hundreds of U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants is fairer to tens of thousands of other families, and some Republican legislators said they agreed with the change.\par \par \uc2 Michelle Schroeder, public policy director for the Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services, also told the House Appropriations Committee that the change, introduced by her agency Oct. 1, was permitted under federal regulations. The U.S. Department of Agriculture funds the food stamp program, though states administer it.\par \par \uc2 The change affects how household incomes are calculated to determine eligibility for the food stamps program, now known as Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. Previously, Kansas, like most other states, discounted a portion of a family's income if some of its members couldn't prove they were in the U.S. legally.\par \par \uc2 SRS calculates that 1,042 households with \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  family members have lost benefits since Oct. 1, affecting 2,066 U.S-born children, although the agency couldn't say how many lost their food stamps specifically because of the policy change. Advocates for immigrants and the poor have been critical, and Democrats pushed the Appropriations Committee to seek explanations from Republican Gov. Sam Brownback's administration.\par \par \uc2 Schroeder said households with illegal immigrants on average were allowed to earn an additional $908 a month income and still qualify for food stamps -- putting them ahead of 106,000 households with no illegal immigrants that didn't qualify. About 141,000 households now receive SNAP benefits.\par \par \uc2 "We just felt it inherently unfair that U.S. citizens were held to a higher standard," Schroeder said. "We wanted to move to a system that was equal."\par \par \uc2 Schroeder said only Arizona, Nebraska and Utah have the same income-calculation policy as Kansas.\par \par \uc2 Some legislators have suggested SRS could have modified the old policy without costing some children their food stamps, but Schroeder said federal rules essentially gave Kansas only two choices, keeping the old policy or imposing the one that took effect in October.\par \par \uc2 Under the old policy, if a household had two working parents who couldn't show they were in the U.S. legally and two U.S.-born children, SRS counted only half the parents' income in determining eligibility. As a result, SRS officials said, families with illegal immigrants could qualify more easily for SNAP benefits than families with no illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 The new Kansas policy made sense to some Republicans, who control the committee and the Legislature.\par \par \uc2 "To me, this is a fairness issue, and I think we're moving in the right direction," said Committee Chairman Marc Rhoades, a Newton Republican.\par \par \uc2 Schroeder said SRS officials are looking at whether they can use another USDA program that provides food to food banks and other charities to increase supplies for the communities most affected by the change in the food stamp policy.\par \par \uc2 Critics of the policy were not satisfied. Several Democrats said they want legislators to further review the issue, and Rep. Barbara Ballard, a Lawrence Democrat, wondered whether the change violated federal civil rights law, a suggestion Schroeder said was unfounded.\par \par \uc2 And Rep. Jerry Henry, a Cummings Democrat, said: "I think we've seen that there are some families struggling with this new policy."\par \par \uc2 Several critics also noted that the state Department of Agriculture is seeking a waiver from federal officials so that agricultural businesses can hire illegal immigrants to fill jobs that remain unfilled.\par \par \uc2 "Immigrant labor is integral to Kansas business right now," said Sister Therese Bangert, a lobbyist for the Sisters of Charity of Leavenworth. "I would hope that we would always err on the side of feeding children that are hungry and for them to have food security."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Online:\par \par \uc2 Kansas Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.srs.ks.gov/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.srs.ks.gov/}}}\par \par \uc2 Kansas Legislature: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.kslegislature.org/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.kslegislature.org/}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120131e81v0001f\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SEATTLE (AP) - In Olympia, it's not all that often that immigrant advocacy groups and farmers are on the same side of a proposed bill.\par \par \uc2 But the unlikely allies have teamed up this session to push a measure aimed at stopping more cities and counties from adopting a federal program that checks an individual's eligibility to work in the country.\par \par \uc2 Known as E-Verify, the internet-based program has to date been adopted by 11 cities and counties in Washington state.\par \par \uc2 Supporters of the program say it provides a free and easy way of doing background checks and avoiding paperwork problems that could lead to losing workers to questionable documents or facing fines for hiring an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Some supporters of E-Verify offer other rationales.\par \par \uc2 "The reasons Lakewood approved E-Verify were to protect the legal workers and to create fair wages in the labor market," said Michael Savage, director of government affairs for the Pierce County city. "If undocumented workers are taking jobs illegally, it artificially deflates the wages."\par \par \uc2 But other than the cities of Lakewood and Kennewick, opposition to the bill that would slow down E-Verify seems minor so far.\par \par \uc2 Backers have lined up a formidable coalition of farmers, immigrant groups, labor and religious groups, while other key interest groups in Olympia, including business organizations, have chosen to remain neutral.\par \par \uc2 "Sometimes you find common ground and it makes all the sense in the world to join forces in trying to win your battle," said Mike Gempler, director of the Washington Growers League.\par \par \uc2 Gempler has teamed up with OneAmerica, the state's largest immigrant advocacy group, to push the bill forward.\par \par \uc2 Farmers and immigrant groups have often clashed, mostly along the lines of minimum wage, housing conditions and other issues of workers' rights.\par \par \uc2 But the two groups have find common ground on the issue of illegal immigration. Famers need the labor. Advocacy groups often decry stern enforcement by the federal government.\par \par \uc2 And sometimes the alliances are not necessarily public. Farmers mostly stayed on the sideline publically last year when moderate and conservative lawmakers of both parties pushed to demand proof of citizenship when obtaining a driver's license. OneAmerica and others fought hard to kill the bill, which eventually did not get a floor vote.\par \par \uc2 On the E-Verify bill, Gempler's counterparts at the state Farm Bureau have decided to remain neutral.\par \par \uc2 "We have some members who are supportive of this legislation, some who feel the bill does not harm or help agriculture in the short term, and some who are concerned about the unintended consequences of pursuing any state legislation (pro or con) on E-Verify," the farm bureau wrote in a statement to lawmakers.\par \par \uc2 But Gempler decided to be more public, and joined OneAmerica executive director Pramila Jayapal in testimony to lawmakers this past week.\par \par \uc2 Both say that a national overhaul of the immigration system is needed before more enforcement is mandated, and state and local governments shouldn't interfere.\par \par \uc2 "We're not saying we never want E-Verify, but do it when you have immigration reform," Jayapal said.\par \par \uc2 For Gempler, a worst case scenario would be for Washington to follow the steps of Arizona or Alabama, which have made E-Verify mandatory for all employers.\par \par \uc2 The Washington bill is preemptive. Besides stopping local jurisdictions from adopting E-Verify, it also stops that state from doing so.\par \par \uc2 Washington, though, has historically been a friendly place for immigrants. State bills in the past pushing stricter enforcement or making English the official language haven't met success. A citizen group called Respect Washington that advocates for stricter immigration enforcement, including making E-Verify mandatory, has failed to obtain enough signatures over the past several years to place an initiative on the ballot.\par \par \uc2 U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which administers E-Verify, declined to comment on state legislation.\par \par \uc2 E-Verify uses several federal government databases to check information on employment documents.\par \par \uc2 The program is mandatory only for federal agencies. Contractors who work with the federal government who meet a certain threshold must use it, said Citizenship and Immigration Services spokeswoman Sharon Rummery.\par \par \uc2 Rummery said nearly 325,000 businesses nationwide voluntarily use the program. In Washington, the number of businesses is more than 5,300.\par \par \uc2 Seventeen states have adopted E-Verify laws, with several, including Utah, Mississippi and Georgia, requiring that private employers use the program.\par \par \uc2 "It's quick and fairly efficient. You're able to see the verification yourself," said Tawni Helms of Whatcom County's executive office. "This is using a new technology for something we're expected to do anyways. It's an expectation to verify employment eligibility."\par \par \uc2 Both Lakewood and Whatcom County require contractors to use E-Verify and both say no problems have been reported. All the jurisdictions in Washington have only adopted E-Verify that affect contractors, not general private employers.\par \par \uc2 But Jayapal said E-Verify has led to errors in the past, which have led to firings of people who were legally in the country.\par \par \uc2 Last year, the federal Government Accountability Office said E-Verify had been improved since its inception in 2004 and identity errors had been reduced, but not eliminated.\par \par \uc2 The state bill was voted out of committee on Friday and it's expected to get a floor vote in the House.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120128e81s001p1\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 DORAL, Fla. (AP) - Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich on Wednesday ridiculed rival Mitt Romney's call for self-deportation of illegal immigrants as an "Obama-level fantasy" that would be inhumane to long-established families living in America. Romney, for his part, accused Gingrich of pandering to a Hispanic audience and said Gingrich himself had supported self-deportation in the past.\par \par \uc2 Discussing immigration in state where 13 percent of registered voters are Hispanic, the former House speaker criticized Romney's immigration policy during a forum with the Spanish-language television network Univision, saying the idea of self-deportation would never work. Romney snapped back at him later in the day at the same forum.\par \par \uc2 During a debate earlier this week, Romney said he favors self-deportation over policies that would require the federal government to round up millions of illegal immigrants and send them back to their home countries. Advocates of Romney's approach argue that illegal immigration can be curbed by denying public benefits to them, prompting them to leave the United States on their own.\par \par \uc2 "You have to live in a world of Swiss bank accounts and Cayman Island accounts and automatically $20 million income for no work to have some fantasy this far from reality," Gingrich said, alluding to details in Romney's income tax returns made public Tuesday. "For Romney to believe that somebody's grandmother is going to be so cut off that she is going to self-deport, I mean this is an Obama-level fantasy."\par \par \uc2 But Gingrich's campaign has spoken of the self-deportation policy he ridiculed Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 "I recognize that it's very tempting to come out to an audience like this and pander to the audience," Romney said, pointing out that Gingrich has previously made comments supporting the idea of self-deportation. "I think that was a mistake on his part."\par \par \uc2 In debates, Gingrich has defended a proposal to allow some illegal immigrants to stay in the U.S. if they've lived here for more than 25 years and have a local sponsor.\par \par \uc2 Romney's campaign directed reporters to past comments by Gingrich spokesman R.C. Hammond, who said that only a small percent of illegal immigrants would likely be allowed to stay in the U.S. under Gingrich's plan. Hammond went on to say that the vast majority of them would likely "self-deport."\par \par \uc2 Gingrich also ran into trouble over a radio ad calling Romney "anti-immigrant." Florida Sen. Marco Rubio called the ad "inaccurate" and "inflammatory." Romney's campaign also asked Gingrich in a letter to pull the ad. Hammond, the Gingrich spokesman, confirmed that the ad was pulled but declined to say whether Rubio's concerns led to the decision.\par \par \uc2 Romney called the anti-immigrant label an "epithet" and "inappropriate."\par \par \uc2 At the forum, Gingrich spoke instead about other elements of his immigration plan, including controlling the border and establishing a guest-worker program to better manage the influx of immigrants. Gingrich said he favors a path to citizenship for \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  children who serve in the military but not for simply completing college.\par \par \uc2 Romney defended his opposition to allowing the children of illegal immigrants to pay in-state tuition at American universities. He said there are inexpensive options that will allow them to go to college.\par \par \uc2 Gingrich told Univision he believes states should charge in-state tuition rates for students who were born in the U.S. to \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  parents, but that he favors charging out-of-state tuition for children who were brought to this country illegally.\par \par \uc2 Texas Gov. Rick Perry's support of a Texas policy to allow children of illegal immigrants to pay in-state tuition proved to be problematic with conservatives nationwide. Perry dropped out of the race last week.\par \par \uc2 Gingrich began the interview by speaking a few halting phrases of welcome in Spanish -- "Buenos Dias estudiantes" -- but begged off when moderator Jorge Ramos pressed him to go further. Romney did not speak any Spanish during his interview.\par \par \uc2 Romney was asked about family members he has living in Mexico. Romney's father, George Romney, was born in Mexico but moved back to the U.S. as a young child.\par \par \uc2 Ramos asked Romney if he had a claim to being Mexican American.\par \par \uc2 "I don't think people would think I was being honest with them if I said I was Mexican American but I'd appreciate it if you'd get that word out," Romney said, smiling.\par \par \uc2 Florida is home to many Hispanics of Puerto Rican or Cuban descent who don't view immigration as a priority but are more interested in the issue than the general public.\par \par \uc2 Both candidates addressed the future of communist Cuba after their interviews.\par \par \uc2 In a speech on Latin America policy, Gingrich said the U.S. needs to take a more active role in demanding change in Fidel Castro's Cuba, much like it did to encourage the Arab spring movement that toppled autocratic leaders in north Africa and the Middle East.\par \par \uc2 "I don't think it's ever occurred to anyone in the White House to look south and propose a Cuban spring," Gingrich said. "If (former Egyptian President Hosni) Mubarak was bad, Castro is worse."\par \par \uc2 Romney, who has significant support from the Cuban-American political establishment in Miami, railed against Castro's regime in a speech before several hundred Cuban-American democracy activists.\par \par \uc2 "It is time for us to strive for freedom in Cuba, and I will do so as president," he said. "We must be prepared to support the voices for democracy in Cuba."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120126e81q001ei\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - The lone survivor of a 2008 traffic shooting that killed his father and two brothers tearfully testified Wednesday that the alleged gang member on trial for the triple murders committed the crimes alone.\par \par \uc2 Andrew Bologna broke down several times on the witness stand while recalling the deadly encounter involving defendant Edwin Ramos, who prosecutors claim mistook someone in Bologna's family as a rival of his MS-13 gang.\par \par \uc2 The Bolognas were on their way home from a picnic when Ramos first blocked their Honda Civic at an intersection in the city's Excelsior District on June 22, 2008, Andrew Bologna, now 21, testified.\par \par \uc2 Ramos then pulled his Chrysler 300 with tinted windows parallel to the Civic and faced Tony Bologna on the driver's side, Andrew Bologna said.\par \par \uc2 "I saw him," Andrew Bologna said of Ramos, pointing toward him. "He was staring at my dad, mugging him, giving him a mean look, when he pulled out a gun."\par \par \uc2 Bologna said there were no words exchanged when Ramos quickly opened fire toward his father's car window before speeding off.\par \par \uc2 Tony Bologna, 48, and his sons, Michael, 20, and Matthew, 16, were killed.\par \par \uc2 Ramos, 25, maintains that another person in his car was the gunman, and that he didn't know that person was going to shoot.\par \par \uc2 Ramos appeared to be the only person inside the Chrysler, Bologna testified.\par \par \uc2 Ramos' lawyer, Marla Zamora, said her client was not a gang member and identified the shooter as Wilfredo Reyes, who has not been located. Earlier this week, Zamora said Ramos was set up by the federal government and the MS-13 street gang to take the fall for the shooting.\par \par \uc2 During her cross-examination Wednesday, Zamora repeatedly questioned Andrew Bologna on his past statements about the shooting, including whether he saw just one person inside the Chrysler and if he did see gunshots.\par \par \uc2 Bologna told Zamora that saw gunfire, heard a "pop-pop-pop" sound and shattering glass while ducking for cover.\par \par \uc2 "I seen Ramos pull out a gun and shoot through my dad's window. ... I did see my dad get shot," said Bologna, choking up. "I didn't see anybody in the passenger's seat."\par \par \uc2 Prosecutor Harry Dorfman then read a question from the jury posed to Bologna asking if the Chrysler's front windshield window was tinted.\par \par \uc2 "Yes. Yes, it was," Bologna replied.\par \par \uc2 The case drew attention to San Francisco's sanctuary policy because Ramos, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from El Salvador, was never turned over for deportation despite previous run-ins with the law as a juvenile.\par \par \uc2 Under a controversial loophole, illegal immigrants charged with crimes as minors were not handed over to federal immigration officials but instead flown home or housed in California at the city's expense. The city has since closed that loophole.\par \par \uc2 With his mother and other relatives weeping loudly in the packed courtroom on Wednesday, Andrew Bologna's voice trembled as he described seeing Ramos speed off as the family's Honda rolled into another vehicle after his father and two brothers were shot.\par \par \uc2 "I didn't know what was going on. It was like a movie," he said, tears streaming down his face. "They shot my family like that. It doesn't make sense."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120126e81q00012\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 DORAL, Fla. (AP) - Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich on Wednesday ridiculed rival Mitt Romney's call for self-deportation of illegal immigrants as an "Obama-level fantasy" that would be inhumane to long-established families living in America. Romney, for his part, accused Gingrich of pandering to a Hispanic audience and said Gingrich himself had supported self-deportation in the past.\par \par \uc2 Discussing immigration in state where 13 percent of registered voters are Hispanic, the former House speaker criticized Romney's immigration policy during a forum with the Spanish-language television network Univision, saying the idea of self-deportation would never work. Romney snapped back at him later in the day at the same forum.\par \par \uc2 During a debate earlier this week, Romney said he favors self-deportation over policies that would require the federal government to round up millions of illegal immigrants and send them back to their home countries. Advocates of Romney's approach argue that illegal immigration can be curbed by denying public benefits to them, prompting them to leave the United States on their own.\par \par \uc2 "You have to live in a world of Swiss bank accounts and Cayman Island accounts and automatically $20 million income for no work to have some fantasy this far from reality," Gingrich said, alluding to details in Romney's income tax returns made public Tuesday. "For Romney to believe that somebody's grandmother is going to be so cut off that she is going to self-deport, I mean this is an Obama-level fantasy."\par \par \uc2 But Gingrich's campaign has spoken of the self-deportation policy he ridiculed Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 "I recognize that it's very tempting to come out to an audience like this and pander to the audience," Romney said, pointing out that Gingrich has previously made comments supporting the idea of self-deportation. "I think that was a mistake on his part."\par \par \uc2 In debates, Gingrich has defended a proposal to allow some illegal immigrants to stay in the U.S. if they've lived here for more than 25 years and have a local sponsor.\par \par \uc2 Romney's campaign directed reporters to past comments by Gingrich spokesman R.C. Hammond, who said that only a small percent of illegal immigrants would likely be allowed to stay in the U.S. under Gingrich's plan. Hammond went on to say that the vast majority of them would likely "self-deport."\par \par \uc2 Gingrich also ran into trouble over a radio ad calling Romney "anti-immigrant." Florida Sen. Marco Rubio called the ad "inaccurate" and "inflammatory." Romney's campaign also asked Gingrich in a letter to pull the ad. Gingrich's campaign had no immediate comment on whether it would comply with the request to pull the ad. The Miami Herald reported that the campaign planned to remove the ad based on Rubio's comments.\par \par \uc2 Romney called the anti-immigrant label an "epithet" and "inappropriate."\par \par \uc2 At the forum, Gingrich spoke instead about other elements of his immigration plan, including controlling the border and establishing a guest-worker program to better manage the influx of immigrants. Gingrich said he favors a path to citizenship for \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  children who serve in the military but not for simply completing college.\par \par \uc2 Romney defended his opposition to allowing the children of illegal immigrants to pay in-state tuition at American universities. He said there are inexpensive options that will allow them to go to college.\par \par \uc2 Gingrich told Univision he believes states should charge in-state tuition rates for students who were born in the U.S. to \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  parents, but that he favors charging out-of-state tuition for children who were brought to this country illegally.\par \par \uc2 Texas Gov. Rick Perry's support of a Texas policy to allow children of illegal immigrants to pay in-state tuition proved to be problematic with conservatives nationwide. Perry dropped out of the race last week.\par \par \uc2 Gingrich began the interview by speaking a few halting phrases of welcome in Spanish -- "Buenos Dias estudiantes" -- but begged off when moderator Jorge Ramos pressed him to go further. Romney did not speak any Spanish during his interview.\par \par \uc2 Romney was asked about family members he has living in Mexico. Romney's father, George Romney, was born in Mexico but moved back to the U.S. as a young child.\par \par \uc2 Ramos asked Romney if he had a claim to being Mexican American.\par \par \uc2 "I don't think people would think I was being honest with them if I said I was Mexican American but I'd appreciate it if you'd get that word out," Romney said, smiling.\par \par \uc2 Florida is home to many Hispanics of Puerto Rican or Cuban descent who don't view immigration as a priority but are more interested in the issue than the general public.\par \par \uc2 After the interview, Romney railed against Fidel Castro's Cuba in a speech before several hundred Cuban-American democracy activists. Romney has significant support from the Cuban-American political establishment in Miami.\par \par \uc2 "It is time for us to strive for freedom in Cuba, and I will do so as president," he said. "We must be prepared to support the voices for democracy in Cuba."\par \par \uc2 While the interview questions asked of both candidates were mostly about Hispanic concerns, Ramos asked Gingrich whether it was hypocritical for him to criticize then-President Bill Clinton and pursue his impeachment in the 1990s when Gingrich was being unfaithful to his second wife.\par \par \uc2 Gingrich snapped at the premise of the question and said it was Clinton's false testimony under oath that bothered him the most.\par \par \uc2 "The fact is I've been through two divorces. I've been deposed both times under oath. Both times I told the truth in the deposition," Gingrich said. "I have never lied under oath. I have never committed perjury."\par \par \uc2 Ramos asked Romney to declare his wealth, to which Romney replied that he's worth between $150 million and "200-and-some-odd million dollars."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120125e81p001bv\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The Joplin Globe, Jan. 23\par \par \uc2 Boostraps and more\par \par \uc2 Joplin has shown the nation -- make that the world -- that it can pick itself up and keep on going even after being hit by terrible disaster.\par \par \uc2 The community also has demonstrated its desire to make improvements to the town during the rebuilding, and relayed those desires to an advisory committee. Some 1,500 responses were received by the group. Hats off to this committee and to the residents who attended the meetings and those who made suggestions. We know that among those were people who had been left homeless by the tornado, yet wanted to be part of the bigger vision for Joplin.\par \par \uc2 On Thursday, in a historic event, Joplin and Duquesne city leaders, school leaders and business leaders met to endorse the recommendations of the advisory committee.\par \par \uc2 Now, it's time to turn the vision into reality. ...\par \par \uc2 First and foremost, in terms of priorities, should be the return of neighborhoods in the tornado-ravaged zone. Pilot neighborhoods with sidewalks and green spaces should give way to what becomes the norm for Joplin. While we don't want a "Stepford" style town, we do like the idea of communities where families can walk and play and sit on the front porch and talk without having to compete with the passing traffic.\par \par \uc2 That's why we also like the emphasis on rebuilding with trails and parks in mind. Joplin has the good fortune to possess areas like Shoal Creek and Turkey Creek that give its residents access to the beauty of nature. We need to make sure in the rebuilding process that we add to those public-access areas, not subtract.\par \par \uc2 Some of the items recommended, at least for now, should be viewed as "wish list" items. Who knows, though.\par \par \uc2 On Friday, Joplin got the good news that it's receiving $45 million in Community Development Block Grant funding for recovery from the May 22 tornado. It can be used for projects such as construction and repair of housing, property acquisition, infrastructure repair, rental assistance, social services and economic development.\par \par \uc2 Selection of the master developer will be, in our view, a key component of the success of the plan.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 The Columbia Tribune, Jan. 22\par \par \uc2 Immigration: Controlling the illegal type\par \par \uc2 Most people think illegal immigration should be controlled. But how? Is it possible?\par \par \uc2 Though you wouldn't know it to hear the most virulent critics rail on, serious progress has been made along the Mexican border. Expensive and effective controls include physical barriers and increased enforcement capability.\par \par \uc2 The Associated Press reports such measures have driven apprehension of migrants to a 40-year low: 2011 was the Border Patrol's slowest year since 1971.\par \par \uc2 In years past, border agents relied on sending scofflaws home without punishment right where they came from, only to be reunited with smugglers who collected additional fees to send them back again. Now U.S. agents send the migrants far from their original point of entry, a tactic said to be effective.\par \par \uc2 Despite these efforts, lawmakers continue to look for ways to find so-called illegals who make it into obscurity here. For instance, a bill being heard in the Missouri Senate would require public schools to check immigration status of all students. School officials object -- and for good reason.\par \par \uc2 This bill has the same problem inherent in laws tried in various states requiring police to check immigration documentation for anyone stopped for any reason. This sort of unrelated mandate puts officers or teachers in the position of enforcing possible violations without reasonable cause and beyond their jurisdictions.\par \par \uc2 The most effective tactic would be an emphasis on employee groups. Work opportunity is the primary reason people cross borders illegally, and successful efforts have been launched to cut off employment by certain companies, but targeting employers is not universally popular.\par \par \uc2 Companies that have been forced to fire undocumented Mexicans, for instance, have discovered the low-cost unskilled jobs can't be filled with domestic workers. Large agricultural companies resist additional immigration control, a silent protest that leads to a political stalemate.\par \par \uc2 So lawmakers turn to less effective methods -- at the borders, in schools and on the highways -- that don't put the government in direct conflict with such a large segment of employers or the economy.\par \par \uc2 Politicians think if every \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  could be stopped at the border, such conflict might be avoided, but incentives for illegal crossing only will get larger as crossing becomes harder and the magnet of employment remains undiminished. We don't have the political gumption to allow large numbers of legal, temporary low-skill workers into our country to satisfy an otherwise unmet demand.\par \par \uc2 The current system will continue, a fight against an uncontrollable tide.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 The Springfield News-Leader, Jan. 20\par \par \uc2 Proposals to amend Missouri's Constitution deserve serious and deliberate consideration.\par \par \uc2 So, we urge the General Assembly to slow down in their haste to pass a resolution asking voters to approve a complex amendment aimed at capping increases in state government spending.\par \par \uc2 The so-called Missouri Taxpayer Protection Act, House Joint Resolution 43, would tie spending increases to the rate of inflation and population growth in Missouri. It would use 2008 state spending of $8 billion as the base -- and since current spending is well below that level, it could be several years before the cap would kick in, if approved by voters.\par \par \uc2 The proposal, sponsored by Rep. Eric Burlison, R-Springfield, also would specify how excess revenues would be used, diverting them to pay down state debt or into reserve funds, or even to temporarily reduce state income tax rates.\par \par \uc2 Burlison has some good arguments that the plan could help even out the boom and bust cycle of state budgets, leading to better long-term plans and rainy day funds to deal with emergencies. Proponents say current restrictions are not enough to keep government from expanding rapidly when times are good.\par \par \uc2 But Missouri's Constitution already includes a limit on growth of tax revenues in the form of the Hancock Amendment, adopted by voters in 1980. We are concerned the additional limits imposed by this proposed amendment may make it increasingly difficult for state government to address critical needs and rapidly emerging priorities.\par \par \uc2 K-12 education, higher education and infrastructure costs do not always directly relate to inflation and population trends. The health care and other needs of an aging population may require different solutions in the future.\par \par \uc2 Plus, new caps on state spending may lead to new local taxes, or higher property taxes. And, ironically, setting 2008 as a base may actually lead to more rapid state spending increases than needed in the short run.\par \par \uc2 Let's not rush a constitutional change before understanding all the ramifications.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 The Kansas City Star, Jan. 18\par \par \uc2 Gov. Jay Nixon should do more to improve Missouri\par \par \uc2 Jay Nixon's latest budget presentation and State of the State address say two things about Missouri's governor.\par \par \uc2 --He is a good manager and an even better politician.\par \par \uc2 --He is determined to play it safe, even when he shouldn't.\par \par \uc2 Nixon's proposed budget for next year reduces expenses by $508 million in ways designed to produce as little uproar as possible.\par \par \uc2 His administration found $192 million in savings in the Medicaid program through smart measures such as more use of generic drugs, rebates from pharmaceutical manufacturers and more efficient management of chronic conditions.\par \par \uc2 But the state's colleges and universities absorb a body blow. Nixon calls for a drastic 12.5 percent cut to each school's budget, marking the third straight year that the chronically underfunded institutions would lose money.\par \par \uc2 On the plus side, Nixon's budget avoids cutting funds for elementary and secondary schools. And it includes a 2 percent salary increase for state employees, who have gone three years without a raise.\par \par \uc2 Overall, it is a safe, damage-control budget designed to get Missouri through one more rocky fiscal year.\par \par \uc2 About the boldest theme Nixon advanced in his speech was a call for the legislature to pass a bill demanding more accountability from charter schools.\par \par \uc2 Nixon, who is well-positioned for re-election, could have done some long-term good by endorsing a proposed ballot initiative to increase the state's lowest-in-the-nation cigarette tax. He could have promoted legislation to bring in revenue by collecting sales taxes from Internet purchases.\par \par \uc2 Instead, the governor boasted in his speech that he has never sought a tax increase. He condescendingly instructed colleges and universities to "cut overhead and administrative costs," refusing to acknowledge that the schools have been doing that for years.\par \par \uc2 Missouri will get by on Nixon's proposed budget, and chances are the governor's political career will prosper. But some of the state's most valuable investments are increasingly at risk while the governor plays it safe.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120124e81o001pr\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Some notable moments from the GOP presidential debate Monday night in Tampa, Fla., a week ahead of the state's Jan. 31 primary:\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 NEWT GINGRICH'S EMPLOYMENT HISTORY\par \par \uc2 Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich clashed repeatedly in heated, personal terms, with the former Massachusetts governor tagging his rival as a Washington "influence peddler," only to be accused in turn of spreading falsehoods over many years in politics.\par \par \uc2 "You've been walking around the state saying things that are untrue," Gingrich retorted in a nearly two-hour debate marked by interruptions and finger-pointing.\par \par \uc2 Romney, newly aggressive after his stinging loss to Gingrich in South Carolina, called Gingrich a former House speaker who "resigned in disgrace" and spent the next 15 years "working as an influence peddler."\par \par \uc2 In particular, he referred to the contract Gingrich's consulting firm had with \uc2 Freddie Mac\uc2 , a government-backed mortgage giant that he said "did a lot of bad for a lot of people and you were working there."\par \par \uc2 "I have never, ever gone and done any lobbying," Gingrich retorted emphatically.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 BEWARE: MEDICARE AHEAD\par \par \uc2 Medicare is a testy subject in Florida, home to 3.3 million seniors.\par \par \uc2 Romney charged that Gingrich lobbied lawmakers to approve legislation creating a new prescription drug benefit under Medicare.\par \par \uc2 Gingrich denied lobbying, but -- aware of his audience -- Gingrich expressed pride in having supported Medicare Part D.\par \par \uc2 "It has saved lives," Gingrich said. "It's run on a free enterprise model."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 WELCOME TO THE SPACE COAST\par \par \uc2 Romney sought to connect what he called President Barack Obama's lack of mission for NASA with Florida's economic difficulties -- a high unemployment rate and a struggling housing market. But he and Gingrich differed on how to reinvigorate the space program.\par \par \uc2 Romney said he would get academics and private investors together to talk about how to make the program a joint venture between government and commercial interests.\par \par \uc2 Gingrich derided that approach as "building a bigger bureaucracy" and proposed instead to offer prizes to innovators who figure out how to go back to the moon permanently and put a human being on Mars.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 IMMIGRANT DREAMS\par \par \uc2 One moderator noted that Romney and rival Rick Santorum have said they would veto the "DREAM Act," which would create conditions under which \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  minors might achieve U.S. citizenship, and asked if Gingrich agreed.\par \par \uc2 "No, I would work to get a signable version," he said. "I think any young person brought here by their parents when they were young should have the same opportunity to join the American military and earn citizenship."\par \par \uc2 Romney said that was the same as his position.\par \par \uc2 Moments later, he was asked to reconcile two other statements he has made about immigration, that while he doesn't want to deport millions of illegal immigrants, he wants them to return to their home countries and apply for citizenship.\par \par \uc2 "The answer is self-deportation," which sounded like a new concept from Romney, who then defined it as "people decide they can do better by going home."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 PANDER-FREE PAUL\par \par \uc2 No one is accusing Ron Paul of playing up to Florida's famously anti-Castro Cuban-American population.\par \par \uc2 His rivals talked about wringing the Castro influence out of Cuba. Gingrich, for one, said the U.S. policy "should be aggressively to overthrow the regime and to do everything we can to support those Cubans who want freedom."\par \par \uc2 "I would do pretty much the opposite," Paul said.\par \par \uc2 The Texas congressman questioned why the U.S. isn't talking to Cuba's leaders after more than a half-century of tense relations.\par \par \uc2 "I think it's time -- time to quit this isolation business of not talking to people," he said. "We talked to the Soviets. We talk to the Chinese. And we opened up trade, and we're not killing each other now. We fought with the Vietnamese for a long time. We finally gave up, started talking to them, now we trade with them. I don't know why -- why the Cuban people should be so intimidating."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120124e81o000hg\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc55}{\*\bkmkend toc55}\b \uc2 Newly aggressive Romney tries to reverse Gingrich's momentum in a crackling Florida debate\b0\par\par\uc2 By STEVE PEOPLES   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 1,186 \uc2 words\par \uc2 24 January 2012\par 06:28\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2012.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 TAMPA, Fla. (AP) - Republican presidential contenders Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich clashed repeatedly in heated, personal terms Monday night in a crackling campaign debate, the former Massachusetts governor tagging his rival as a Washington "influence peddler," only to be accused in turn of spreading falsehoods over many years in politics.\par \par \uc2 "You've been walking around the state saying things that are untrue," Gingrich told his rival in a two-hour debate marked by occasional interruptions and finger-pointing.\par \par \uc2 The event marked the first encounter among the four remaining GOP contenders -- former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum and Texas Rep. Ron Paul shared the stage -- since Gingrich won the South Carolina primary in an upset last weekend.\par \par \uc2 His double-digit victory reset the race to pick a rival to challenge Democratic President Barack Obama this fall, and the next contest is the Jan. 31 Florida primary.\par \par \uc2 With a week of campaigning ahead, Romney is expected to release his income tax return for 2010 as well as an estimate for 2011 on Tuesday. He said it will show he paid all the taxes he was obligated to pay, adding, "I don't think the voters want a president who pays more than he owes."\par \par \uc2 Following his defeat in South Carolina, Romney can ill afford to lose in Florida, and he was the aggressor from the opening moments Monday night. He said Gingrich had "resigned in disgrace" from Congress after four years as speaker and then had spent the next 15 years "working as an influence peddler."\par \par \uc2 In particular, he referred to the contract Gingrich's consulting firm had with \uc2 Freddie Mac\uc2 , a government-backed mortgage giant that he said "did a lot of bad for a lot of people and you were working there."\par \par \uc2 Romney also said Gingrich had lobbied lawmakers to approve legislation creating a new prescription drug benefit under Medicare.\par \par \uc2 "I have never, ever gone and done any lobbying," Gingrich retorted emphatically, adding that his firm had hired an expert to explain to employees "the bright line between what you can do as a citizen and what you do as a lobbyist."\par \par \uc2 Romney counterpunched, referring to the $300,000 that Gingrich's consulting firm received in 2006 from \uc2 Freddie Mac\uc2 , the government-backed mortgage giant.\par \par \uc2 And when Gingrich sought to turn the tables by inquiring about the private equity firm that Romney founded, the former Massachusetts governor replied: "We didn't do any work with the government. ...I wasn't a lobbyist."\par \par \uc2 As for the Medicare prescription drug benefit, Gingrich expressed pride in having supported it. "It has saved lives. It's run on a free enterprise model," he said in a state that is home to millions of seniors.\par \par \uc2 Whatever the stated subject, the debate's subtext was character -- and electability, the quality that Republican voters say consistently matters most to them in the race.\par \par \uc2 Gingrich said voters don't want a president who will "manage the decay," but change the country. "That requires sending somebody who's prepared to be controversial when necessary."\par \par \uc2 Romney pointed to his career in business, his turn as head of the Salt Lake City Olympics and a term as governor of Massachusetts.\par \par \uc2 Obama took his lumps, as customary in a Republican debate.\par \par \uc2 Romney said the president lacks a vision for NASA, and said, "There are people on the Space Coast that are suffering and Florida itself is suffering as a result."\par \par \uc2 He proposed that "a collection" of academics and private investors consult with the president on a new mission for the space agency and have the program funded jointly by the government and private industry.\par \par \uc2 Gingrich called that answer "building a bigger bureaucracy" and instead proposed handing out prizes to people who come up with ways to "make the Space Coast literally hum with activity." Going back to the moon permanently, putting a man on mars and building space stations should be priorities, he said.\par \par \uc2 When the debate turned to immigration, one moderator noted that Romney and Santorum have said they would veto the "Dream Act," which would create conditions under which \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  minors might achieve U.S. citizenship, and asked if Gingrich agreed.\par \par \uc2 "No, I would work to get a signable version," he said. "I think any young person brought here by their parents when they were young should have the same opportunity to join the American military and earn citizenship."\par \par \uc2 Romney said that was the same as his position.\par \par \uc2 Moments later, he was asked to reconcile two other statements he has made about immigration, that while he doesn't want to deport millions of illegal immigrants, he wants them to return to their home countries and apply for citizenship. "The answer is self-deportation, which is people decide they can do better by going home," he said.\par \par \uc2 At times, the other two contenders on stage were reduced to supporting roles.\par \par \uc2 Asked if he could envision a path to the nomination for himself, Santorum said the race has so far been defined by its unpredictability.\par \par \uc2 He jumped at the chance to criticize both Romney and Gingrich for having supported the big federal bailouts of Wall Street in 2008.\par \par \uc2 He also said both men had abandoned conservative principles by supporting elements of "cap and trade" legislation to curb pollution emissions from industrial sites. "When push came to shove, they were pushed," he said.\par \par \uc2 Paul sidestepped when moderator Brian Williams of NBC asked if he would run as a third-party candidate in the fall if he doesn't win the nomination. "I have no intention," he said, but he didn't rule it out.\par \par \uc2 Paul has said he will largely bypass Florida to concentrate on states that are holding caucuses.\par \par \uc2 Hit at the outset with Romney' charge that he had resigned Congress in disgrace and went on to a career peddling his own influence, Gingrich said two men who had run against the former governor in the 2008 campaign, John McCain and Mike Huckabee, had said he couldn't tell the truth.\par \par \uc2 The polls post-South Carolina show Gingrich and Romney leading in the Florida primary. That and the former speaker's weekend victory explained why the two were squabbling even before the debate began, and why they tangled almost instantly once it had begun.\par \par \uc2 Romney began airing a harshly critical new campaign ad and said the former House speaker had engaged in "potentially wrongful activity" with the consulting work he did after leaving Congress in the late 1990s.\par \par \uc2 Gingrich retorted that Romney was a candidate who was campaigning on openness yet "has released none of his business records."\par \par \uc2 He followed up two hours before the debate by arranging the release of a contract his former consulting firm had with the \uc2 Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp\uc2 . for a retainer of $25,000 per month in 2006, or a total for the year of $300,000.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - A prosecutor said Monday that an alleged gang member shot and killed a father and two sons in traffic three years ago, and the defense attorney portrayed her client as a fall guy for the notorious MS-13 street gang and the government.\par \par \uc2 Edwin Ramos is accused of opening fire on Tony Bologna, 48, and two of his sons, Michael, 20, and Matthew, 16, at an intersection in the city's Excelsior district while they drove home from a picnic June 22, 2008.\par \par \uc2 During opening statements, the prosecution said Ramos mistook one of the sons for a rival gang member. He also tried to kill a fourth person in Bologna's car at close range, Assistant District Attorney Harry Dorfman said.\par \par \uc2 "Here sits the man who is responsible for these murders and so much suffering," said Dorfman, adding that Andrew Bologna, who was in the car and survived, will take the stand this week.\par \par \uc2 Danielle Bologna, the wife and mother of the victims, cried as she sat in the first row with family members.\par \par \uc2 Ramos has told police he was the getaway driver and owner of the Chrysler 300 involved in the shooting, but claims another man in his car, Wilfredo Reyes, another suspected MS-13 member, was the gunman. Prosecutors say Ramos was the only gunman.\par \par \uc2 Reyes has not been found.\par \par \uc2 Ramos' lawyer, Marla Zamora, told jurors that her client has been set up by the federal government and the MS-13. He had no idea that Reyes would shoot across from him toward the Bologna family, she argued.\par \par \uc2 "The government and the MS-13 made him the fall guy for the murders of three people," said Zamora, as several members of Bologna's family stormed out of the courtroom in apparent disgust.\par \par \uc2 Zamora later said that Ramos fled the scene and Reyes asked him to stop the car. Zamora told jurors that Ramos said Reyes told him to "get rid of the car," before he ran off.\par \par \uc2 Zamora said Ramos changed his story to police from not being at the scene to being the getaway driver because he was scared of saying Reyes was the shooter because his wife and child would be in danger.\par \par \uc2 "I'm a dead man," Zamora said Ramos told investigators.\par \par \uc2 She added that investigators grilled Ramos for hours to the point of "they broke him, no doubt about it, they broke him."\par \par \uc2 The killings sparked public outrage over the city's sanctuary policy because Ramos, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , was never turned over for deportation despite a felony arrest as a juvenile. The city has since closed that policy loophole.\par \par \uc2 The trial is expected to last for several weeks.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120124e81o0008e\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

They say Ramos mistook one of the sons for a rival gang member.\par \par \uc2 Ramos told police he was the driver but maintains that he had no idea the gunman in his car was going to shoot.\par \par \uc2 The killings sparked public outrage over the city's sanctuary policy because Ramos, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , was never turned over for deportation despite a felony arrest as a juvenile. The city has since closed that policy loophole.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120123e81n001gp\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 DENVER (AP) - Illegal immigrants attending Colorado high schools are waiting to see if this is the year the Legislature allows them to attend state universities at tuition rates that are higher than those for in-state students but lower than out-of-state levels.\par \par \uc2 Both parties have defeated the bill in the past. This year, passage is likely in the Senate, led by Democrats, but uncertain in the House, controlled by Republicans. But a Republican House lawmaker of Mexican descent who has been discussing the legislation with Democrats could influence its passage.\par \par \uc2 This is the sixth time state lawmakers have tried to make college more affordable to illegal immigrants, who don't qualify for the less-expensive in-state tuition. Out-of-state tuition can be up to five times higher, and supporters said that's an obstacle many college-bound illegal immigrants raised in the U.S. can't overcome.\par \par \uc2 "When you have a 9th grader or a 10th grader or an 8th grader who realizes they have no prospects for long-term success, they lose hope," said Democratic Sen. Michael Johnston, a sponsor of the legislation.\par \par \uc2 Opponents argue that state funds should not subsidize the tuition of illegal immigrants. Over the years, supporters have modified their proposal to placate opponents.\par \par \uc2 Last year, Democratic lawmakers proposed taking out a state stipend, so illegal immigrants would pay a slightly higher rate than in-state students. The legislation still failed. This year, in addition to taking away the stipend, the proposal gives colleges the ability to opt out of creating what would be a third tuition category.\par \par \uc2 For example, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  student attending the University of Colorado at Boulder would pay about $9,500 annually, compared with an estimated $7,700 for in-state tuition and about $28,850 for out of state. To qualify, students must have graduated from a state high school after attending at least three years. They must also sign an affidavit saying they are seeking, or will seek, legal status.\par \par \uc2 "Even though our kids are going to be paying substantially more than their in-state colleagues, it still gives them a chance at access they wouldn't have otherwise," Johnston said.\par \par \uc2 A hearing on the bill, introduced last week, is yet to be scheduled.\par \par \uc2 Johnston said an estimated 300 to 500 students would benefit from the bill, and colleges could take in $2 million in tuition revenue as a result.\par \par \uc2 Thirteen states -- including Texas, California, Illinois and Connecticut -- have passed legislation granting in-state tuition for immigrant students, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\par \par \uc2 Republican Rep. Robert Ramirez, who was among those who voted to defeat the legislation in the House last year, has been working with Democrats on the bill. Although he has yet to sign on in support, Ramirez said he might support the legislation if it ensures no state general fund money goes to the students. He said he's working on amendments to the bill but would not discuss them.\par \par \uc2 Some opponents of the bill argue it would encourage illegal immigration, which supporters dismiss.\par \par \uc2 "I don't buy that. Not with this bill. If that was the case, Texas and these other states would've been flooded by now," said Ramirez, who sits on the House Education Committee that will hear the bill first if it passes the Senate.\par \par \uc2 Ramirez has said he has been pressured to vote for the bill because of his Hispanic heritage. His father moved to the U.S. from the Mexican city of Chapala, Jalisco, and Ramirez said his path to citizenship was a long, difficult and expensive process.\par \par \uc2 "I'm pretty proud of my heritage, I'm very proud to be Hispanic but this is about what's right for the state of Colorado," he said.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120117e81h001fe\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc62}{\*\bkmkend toc62}\b \uc2 GOP beefs up Hispanic outreach as anti-immigration rhetoric intensifies\b0\par\par\uc2 By JERI CLAUSING   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 1,069 \uc2 words\par \uc2 15 January 2012\par 15:03\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2012.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) - The Republican Party is beefing up its minority outreach nationwide and preparing to put its rising Latino stars on the campaign trail amid concerns that tough immigration rhetoric in the presidential primary is taking on an increasingly anti-Hispanic tone.\par \par \uc2 But immigrant-rights groups and some political watchers say the damage may be irreversible. They argue that the GOP has severely hampered itself as it looks to woo the critical Latino voting bloc that could decide who wins key states like New Mexico, Nevada, Colorado and Florida next fall.\par \par \uc2 Mitt Romney "is done," said DeeDee Blase, founder of Somos Republicans in Arizona. "He'll be lucky to get 8 percent of the Hispanic vote" after saying he would veto legislation that would create a path to citizenship for some illegal immigrants and accepting the endorsement of anti-immigration activist Kris Kobach, architect of two of the strongest immigration crackdown laws in the country.\par \par \uc2 The GOP front-runner, Romney has referred to the legislation -- called the DREAM Act -- as a handout. The measure would allow some young illegal immigrants brought to the U.S. as children to earn legal status if they went to college or joined the military. Challengers, including Texas Gov. Perry, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum and Ron Paul, have also taken tough anti-immigration stances in the campaign.\par \par \uc2 Language from them has been so sharp that even New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez, a Republican, has warned the candidates to watch their tongues.\par \par \uc2 "What we have to do is this: We have to tone down the rhetoric, and we have to have a sincere, honest conversation with the voters," Martinez said Wednesday, shortly after the Republican National Committee announced that it had hired a director of Hispanic outreach and was expanding its Latino-focused efforts. She's among the popular Hispanic politicians Republicans will deploy to battleground states in the coming months.\par \par \uc2 There's a reason for the urgent tone coming from Republican leaders on this matter.\par \par \uc2 The government projects Hispanics will account for roughly 30 percent of the population by 2050, doubling in size and boosting their political power. Overall, Hispanics traditionally tilt Democrat, meaning the Republican Party is looking at a threat to their future power if they don't work to make inroads with this politically pivotal group now.\par \par \uc2 Democrats have strengthened their standing with Hispanics in the most recent presidential election years. While much was made during the Democratic primary of 2008 of President Barack Obama's perceived weakness among Hispanics, he won 67 percent of their vote in the general election to 31 percent for Republican John McCain. It was a huge jump from 2004 when Democratic nominee John Kerry won Hispanics by 53 percent to 44 percent for Bush, a Texan who focused heavily on Hispanics.\par \par \uc2 Some worry that this year's eventual GOP nominee won't fare much better than McCain four years ago -- and may fare worse -- if candidates don't soften the way they talk about immigration.\par \par \uc2 "It's an emotional issue, and I think if the candidate can realize that and talk about it, you can still be conservative on immigration and talk about it in a way that doesn't turn off Hispanics," said Jennifer Korn, executive director of the Hispanic Leadership Network. She agreed that "some of the rhetoric could be pared back a bit" but disagreed that presidential candidates are shutting out huge blocs of Latino voters.\par \par \uc2 The issue is about to push to the forefront as the race for the GOP presidential nomination moves to Florida after South Carolina votes Jan. 21.\par \par \uc2 Korn's group is sponsoring its third conference in February in Miami, one day before it sponsors a debate with CNN.\par \par \uc2 Newt Gingrich, who supports a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants, is the only presidential candidate scheduled to speak at the event.\par \par \uc2 Mindful of the challenges, the Republican National Committee unveiled expanded efforts to woo Hispanics last week.\par \par \uc2 Party Chairman Reince Priebus said the national party had hired Bettina Inclan as director of Hispanic outreach and was implementing a "multifaceted approach to connect with the Hispanic community" that will include digital outreach, traditional voter identification and get-out-the-vote efforts. It is also putting teams on the ground in key states, he said, and will tap popular GOP Hispanics like Martinez, Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio.\par \par \uc2 Yet even as they announced boosted efforts, Priebus and Inclan downplayed the impact the immigration issue will have come November, emphasizing the unemployment rate among Hispanics is at 11 percent, almost two points higher than the national average.\par \par \uc2 "We need to address it," Inclan said. "We need to talk about it. But poll after poll shows the No. 1 issue for Latinos in this country is going to be how they are going to feed their family."\par \par \uc2 Democrats, meanwhile, are making the GOP's task harder. Obama's campaign is way ahead in its grassroots outreach to Hispanics thanks to the fact that he doesn't have a primary opponent. His re-election campaign has had teams long in place on the ground in states like Florida, Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado and Nevada. And volunteers already are knocking on doors and conducting voter registration drives and weekly phone banks to shore up the Latino base.\par \par \uc2 But immigration is also a weak spot for Obama ahead of the November election.

Martinez\b0\par\par\uc2 By RUSSELL CONTRERAS   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 515 \uc2 words\par \uc2 15 January 2012\par 11:06\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2012.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) - Immigrant advocates and their allies are preparing for another round of rallies and lobbying efforts in their quest to protect a state law that allows some illegal immigrants to obtain a state driver's license.\par \par \uc2 The preparation comes as lawmakers are set to begin a new legislative session and after activists have held community meetings around the state to organize immigrants, students and religious leaders.\par \par \uc2 The 30-day session that begins Tuesday is expected to focus on the state budget, but Gov. Susana Martinez also wants lawmakers to repeal the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  driver's license law.\par \par \uc2 Martinez has pressed lawmakers to do away with the law before, including a high-profile effort during last year's session. It also was a key issue in her gubernatorial campaign.\par \par \uc2 "I don't know what else can be discussed about it," Martinez told The Associated Press. "What we need to do is just sit down and vote on the issue. Just vote."\par \par \uc2 But Marcela Diaz, executive director of Somos Un Pueblo Unido, a Santa Fe-based immigrant advocacy group, said the only reason the issue is coming up again is because politicians are using the state's driver's license repeal to appeal to anti-immigrant voters.\par \par \uc2 "This is part of a larger narrative to go after immigrants," said Diaz, who is organizing groups around the state for a rally and lobbying effort Jan. 24. "The law is an incentive for immigrants to follow state law and makes the state safer."\par \par \uc2 Diaz predicted that hundreds of immigrants and their allies will come to Santa Fe for the Jan. 24th event, and others will return throughout the session.\par \par \uc2 New Mexico is one of only three states -- the others are Washington and Utah -- where an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  can get a driver's license because no proof of citizenship is required. However, Utah's permits cannot be used as government ID cards.\par \par \uc2 Joining Somos Un Pueblo Unido is the New Mexico Catholic Conference of Bishops who vowed to bring members to Santa Fe to put pressure on lawmakers to keep the law in place. This week, Catholic churches around the state used the church's annual "National Migration Week" to pass out information and hold community meetings over the issue.\par \par \uc2 "The last time we got involved, I think we changed the debate," said Catholic Archbishop Michael Sheehan of Santa Fe.\par \par \uc2 In addition, Rev. Angela Herrera, an assistant minister with the First Unitarian Church of Albuquerque, said members of her church and other interfaith leaders were planning to write letters and lobby lawmakers to keep the law.\par \par \uc2 Christina Parker, a spokeswoman for the Border Network for Human Rights, an El Paso, Texas-based immigrant advocacy group, said activists are scheduled on Martin Luther King Jr. Day to hold a march in downtown Las Cruces to support the law.\par \par \uc2 "A day off for most is a day on for us," said Parker. "We have to keep up the pressure."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120115e81f0022c\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 CHICAGO (AP) - Controversy over a Cook County ordinance that forbids the sheriff from notifying federal officials when they're about to release suspected illegal immigrants from jail is heating up after a suspect charged in a fatal hit-and-run posted bail and disappeared.\par \par \uc2 Amid reports that Saul Chavez, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , hasn't been seen since late last year when his family posted bail, the nation's top immigration official and the board president of the county that includes Chicago have squared off with dueling statements about the ordinance passed last September.\par \par \uc2 "This ordinance undermines public safety in Cook County and hinders (the Immigration and Customs Enforcement's) ability to enforce the nation's immigration laws," wrote the agency's director, John Morton, in a letter to County Board President Toni Preckwinkle. "In addition to undermining local public safety, the Ordinance may also violate federal law."\par \par \uc2 Preckwinkle, though, responded in a news release that it isn't fair to link Chavez's immigration status with his disappearance, calling it a "red herring."\par \par \uc2 Preckwinkle said she is bothered by the case, not because of Chavez's immigration status, but because his bail was set too low for someone with a prior felony conviction and who posed a flight risk.\par \par \uc2 "Some have tried to blame Chavez's immigration status, but what allowed Chavez to escape prosecution was an attainable bond that didn't take into account his criminal history and flight risk," she said in the news release.\par \par \uc2 Cook County has been at the center of the debate over the treatment of illegal immigrants for several months. While other places, such as San Francisco, have passed similar measures in response to the Obama administration's program that aims to pursue more criminal deportations, Cook County was the first to forbid a sheriff from holding suspected felons as well as those accused of misdemeanors.\par \par \uc2 Proponents say the county's previous practice of holding immigrants in jail after they served their time or posted bail until federal agents could pick them up was unfair and unconstitutional.\par \par \uc2 "By refusing the detain people who are entitled to their freedom, based merely on a request from (immigration agents) we are upholding our system of justice," Jesus Garcia, a commissioner who supported the measure, said in a statement at the time.\par \par \uc2 But critics have said the ordinance is a disaster waiting to happen, that ultimately an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who otherwise could have been held by federal authorities is going to walk out of jail and commit another crime.\par \par \uc2 "This is our Willie Horton moment in Cook County," warned Commissioner Timothy Schneider at the time he voted against the ordinance, referring to the convicted killer who raped a woman after being released as part of a Massachusetts program.\par \par \uc2 In her news release this week, Preckwinkle said the problem has nothing to do with immigration and everything to do with an overwhelmed criminal justice system. Judges, she said, have to make decisions "in an instant, without access to the appropriate level of information upon which to base their decision."\par \par \uc2 As a result, Preckwinkle has called for the Cook County Judicial Advisory Council to conduct a six-month study on how bail is set in the county. According to a statement by Preckwinkle, one of the goals is to provide judges with more complete information about defendants before they decide on bail.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120113e81d0023j\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 CHICAGO (AP) - Controversy over a Cook County ordinance that forbids the sheriff from notifying federal officials when they're about to release suspected illegal immigrants from jail is heating up after a suspect charged in a fatal hit-and-run posted bail and disappeared.\par \par \uc2 Amid reports that Saul Chavez, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , hasn't been seen since late last year when his family posted bail, the nation's top immigration official and the board president of the county that includes Chicago have squared off with dueling statements about the ordinance passed by the board last September.\par \par \uc2 "This ordinance undermines public safety in Cook County and hinders (the Immigration and Customs Enforcement's) ability to enforce the nation's immigration laws," wrote the agency's director, John Morton, in a letter to County Board President Toni Preckwinkle. "In addition to undermining local public safety, the Ordinance may also violate federal law."\par \par \uc2 Preckwinkle, though, responded in a news release that it isn't fair to link Chavez's immigration status with his disappearance, calling it a "red herring."\par \par \uc2 Preckwinkle said she is bothered by the case, not because of his immigration status, but because his bail was set too low for someone with a prior felony conviction and who posed a flight risk.\par \par \uc2 "Some have tried to blame Chavez's immigration status, but what allowed Chavez to escape prosecution was an attainable bond that didn't take into account his criminal history and flight risk," she said in the news release.\par \par \uc2 She said a big problem is that the criminal justice system is so overwhelmed that judges have to make decisions "in an instant, without access to the appropriate level of information upon which to base their decision."\par \par \uc2 As a result, Preckwinkle has called for the Cook County Judicial Advisory Council to conduct a six-month study on how bail is set in the county. According to a statement by Preckwinkle, one of the goals is to provide judges with more complete information about defendants before they decide on bail.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120113e81d001rh\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) - A former New Mexico Motor Vehicle Division employee wasn't allowed to speak Spanish to non-English-speaking foreign nationals seeking to renew their driver's licenses and was fired when she complained about discrimination against Latino immigrants, according to a federal civil rights lawsuit filed Thursday.\par \par \uc2 The Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund filed the suit in Santa Fe on behalf of Laura Montano of Albuquerque. The 39-year-old lost her job "after she voiced objections to a number of unfair, improper and discriminatory acts, policies, and practices," the lawsuit said.\par \par \uc2 The firing violated the federal Whistleblower Protection Act, MALDEF said in the lawsuit. State officials, however, said Thursday that Montano was a temporary contract employee who was let go because of poor performance.\par \par \uc2 New Mexico is one of only three states -- the others are Washington and Utah -- where an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  can get a driver's license because no proof of citizenship is required. However, Utah's permits cannot be used as government ID cards.\par \par \uc2 Gov. Susana Martinez has pressed lawmakers twice to repeal the law allowing those in the country illegally from obtaining state driver's licenses. The governor has said she wanted state lawmakers to revisit the issue during the next legislative session, which begins next week.\par \par \uc2 Thursday's lawsuit comes as state workers work to carry out a Martinez administration initiative to check residency requirements of some immigrants with New Mexico driver's licenses. A state judge has blocked the "Foreign National Residency Recertification Program" pending the outcome of another lawsuit brought by MALDEF that challenges the constitutionality of the program.\par \par \uc2 MALDEF staff attorney Rebecca Couto said Montano was told not to speak Spanish to foreign nationals or to translate English documents during interviews to prove residency requirements.\par \par \uc2 "Some immigrants would come in with huge files, sometimes 250 pages," Couto said. "She wasn't able to tell them which documents she needed, so they left without licenses."\par \par \uc2 Montano said she was a temporary employee who began working at the department in July and was hoping to gain a permanent job with the division.\par \par \uc2 "I quickly learned that the way the DMV was putting into practices the governor's residency recertification program made us treat certain groups of Mexicans differently," Montano said at a news conference announcing the lawsuit, which seeks back pay and damages.\par \par \uc2 Montano's account fits squarely with what Somos Un Pueblo Unido has been hearing from immigrants around the state, said Marcela Diaz, executive director of the Santa Fe-based immigrant advocacy group.\par \par \uc2 "We have known for a long time that this particular program was a farce," Diaz said. "It wasn't really meant to do anything other than forward a political agenda that includes taking away driver's licenses from immigrants who live and work and pay taxes in our state."\par \par \uc2 Montano worked on the residential certification program for around two weeks, said Demesia Padilla, cabinet secretary for the New Mexico Taxation and Revenue Department, which oversees the MVD.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 FRAMINGHAM, Mass. (AP) - The defense for President Barack Obama's uncle is reviewing the driving records of the police officer who arrested him on drunken driving charges.\par \par \uc2 Onyango Obama, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , appeared briefly in Framingham District Court on Thursday as his lawyer told a judge he has obtained the driving history of the officer who stopped Obama in August in Framingham.\par \par \uc2 Officer Val Krishtal said in a written police report that he stopped Obama after Obama did not come to a complete stop at a stop sign, causing his police cruiser to nearly strike Obama's SUV. Krishtal said Obama failed several field sobriety tests and registered 0.14 on a blood-alcohol test, higher than the state's legal limit of 0.08.\par \par \uc2 Obama's attorney, P. Scott Bratton, said he is reviewing Krishtal's driving records to see whether Krishtal has a history of accidents. Bratton has said previously that Obama was not committing any traffic violations and police had no right to pull him over. He is seeking to suppress the traffic stop and the results of the blood-alcohol test. A judge will hear arguments on those motions on March 1.\par \par \uc2 "We want to review the record to see if there is a pattern of conduct of bad driving behavior on the part of the arresting officer," Bratton said.\par \par \uc2 Krishtal totaled his police cruiser in November while responding to reports of gunshots.\par \par \uc2 Framingham police declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Middlesex District Attorney Gerry Leone said prosecutors were not opposed to turning over the records. Bratton said a lawyer for the town of Framingham provided the records.\par \par \uc2 Obama, 67, who is originally from Kenya, is the half brother of the president's late father. He has pleaded not guilty to operating under the influence of alcohol, negligent operation of a motor vehicle and failure to yield the right of way.\par \par \uc2 Police said that after being booked at the police station, Obama said, "I think I will call the White House" when asked if he wanted to make a telephone call to arrange for bail.\par \par \uc2 The status of Obama's immigration case could not immediately be determined. A spokeswoman for the Executive Office for Immigration Review did not immediately return a call seeking comment Thursday.\par \par \uc2 Obama initially was held without bail on a detainer from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on allegations he violated an order to return to Kenya 20 years ago. He was later released and has been ordered to regularly check in with immigration officials.\par \par \uc2 The White House has said it expects Obama's arrest to be handled like any other case.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120112e81c0019o\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

Legislature plan to file a long-shot bill to repeal 2010 immigration law\b0\par\par\uc2 387 \uc2 words\par \uc2 12 January 2012\par 08:58\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2012.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHOENIX (AP) - Democratic lawmakers in Arizona plan to propose a repeal of the state's 2010 immigration enforcement law but concede that the bill won't go far at the Legislature.\par \par \uc2 The Arizona Republic reports ( {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://bit.ly/yrD0La"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://bit.ly/yrD0La}}}\uc2 ) that Democratic state Sen. Steve Gallardo, of Phoenix, plans to file a bill this week that would be the first legislative attempt in Arizona to do away with the law.\par \par \uc2 A federal judge has blocked enforcement the law's most contentious sections, such as a requirement that police, while enforcing other laws, question people's immigration status if officers suspect they are in the country illegally. But the judge allowed other sections to take effect, including a ban on blocking of traffic when people seek or offer day-labor services on streets.\par \par \uc2 Democratic opponents of the law are emboldened by the recall of the law's author and a flagging public interest in immigration enforcement laws.\par \par \uc2 Gallardo said he knows the bill likely won't get far, but he believes support for measures that attempt to deter illegal immigration by criminal enforcement has declined both in the Legislature and throughout Arizona.\par \par \uc2 "Look at the image this has provided to the state of Arizona," he said. "This is a black cloud that continues to hang over it. Some of the (legislative) members would agree that it might be best to pull the plug on it."\par \par \uc2 Republican Rep. John Kavanagh, of Fountain Hills, a key backer of the law, said the law is more popular than ever.\par \par \uc2 "Clearly, this is nothing more than a political ploy to garner voter approval," Kavanagh said. "It has zero chance."\par \par \uc2 Republican Sen. Frank Antenori, of Tucson, who voted for the law, said it's unlikely any committee chairman would give a proposed repeal a hearing.\par \par \uc2 "I don't give it much of a chance," he said.\par \par \uc2 More than two dozen states considered bills last year similar to Arizona's immigration law. Four passed them.\par \par \uc2 Arizona Republicans are expected to propose at least a few new immigration measures this session, such as a bill that would require public schools to keep track of their numbers of \uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2  students.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Information from: The Arizona Republic, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.azcentral.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.azcentral.com}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120112e81c0014g\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) - Had Assemblyman Tim Donnelly not been stopped by airport security, he could have walked straight into the state Capitol carrying his loaded Colt .45-caliber handgun.\par \par \uc2 Unlike civilians, state lawmakers do not have to pass through metal detectors to get inside the building, security officials said Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 Another gap in the Capitol's security system that has been highlighted since Donnelly's gun incident last week is the parking garage used by lawmakers. There is no security checkpoint for lawmakers -- or anyone else -- coming from the underground garage into the Capitol.\par \par \uc2 There is nothing to prevent lawmakers and others who use unsecured entry ways from bringing a weapon inside the building, but no changes are planned, according to sergeants-at-arms in the Assembly and Senate, and the California Highway Patrol.\par \par \uc2 However, Alicia Trost, a spokeswoman for Senate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg, D-Sacramento, said the Senate leader would discuss Capitol security with the Rules Committee, other senators, and the Senate sergeants to see if there is a need to revisit the Legislature's current security policies.\par \par \uc2 Lawmakers are supposed to get permission from the Assembly and Senate sergeants-at-arms if they want to bring in a weapon, but sergeants take them at their word. Moreover, employees who work in the building have electronic pass cards that let them enter after hours without going through a security screening.\par \par \uc2 Donnelly said he had no intention of bringing his loaded handgun with him to work. He was cited for a misdemeanor after Transportation Security Administration screeners spotted the gun at Ontario International Airport, east of Los Angeles, as he was headed to the Capitol for the first day of this year's legislative session.\par \par \uc2 Donnelly said he had the handgun because he had received death threats over his support for a potential ballot referendum that sought to undo a new law related to public financial aid for \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  college students. He said he had forgotten that he had placed it in his briefcase before taking it to the airport.\par \par \uc2 The San Bernardino County district attorney's office is still reviewing Donnelly's misdemeanor citation, said spokesman Christopher Lee.\par \par \uc2 Officer Sean Kennedy, spokesman for the CHP Office of Capitol Protection, said the Donnelly incident raises "a great question" about the gap in security. But Kennedy said rules for entering the building are set by the Assembly and Senate sergeants-at-arms, who in turn answer to the Legislature's Joint Rules Committee.\par \par \uc2 Armed CHP officers back up security screeners and sweep vehicles in the Capitol's basement garage for bombs after the occupants have left the vehicles to be parked.\par \par \uc2 The Rules Committee decided to exempt lawmakers from passing through security checkpoints when metal detectors were installed at the Capitol after 9/11, said Tony Beard, the Senate's chief sergeant.\par \par \uc2 "We're always looking at the security of the Capitol. Those are constant conversations," said the Assembly's chief sergeant, Ronald E. Pane.\par \par \uc2 Both said they see no reason to make a change. Several lawmakers who sit on the Rules Committee had no immediate comment on whether they might seek a review of the Capitol's security gaps.\par \par \uc2 Both sergeants-at-arms said they are confident that lawmakers who felt the need to carry weapons would inform them as required by Capitol rules.\par \par \uc2 Last year, four Assembly members asked to bring their guns to work for self-defense, though they were denied permission after sergeants-at-arms in the 80-member Assembly began carrying handguns full-time.\par \par \uc2 The decision to arm sergeants in the Assembly, though not the Senate, was made after threats against state lawmakers and the shooting of Arizona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords a year ago.\par \par \uc2 A law that took effect last year requires everyone except peace officers to get permission from the sergeants-at-arms before bringing their guns into legislative buildings, even if they have a concealed weapons permit from a local sheriff.\par \par \uc2 "If there was some reason they had to bring it in, they'd come talk with us," Pane said.\par \par \uc2 Employees were initially exempted from screenings as well, until several years after the screenings were started for civilians entering the building. Now workers must go through the metal detectors during normal business hours, but they can use their employee cards to enter unscreened on nights and weekends.\par \par \uc2 Changing that rule could affect employees' ability to conduct the public's business, said Larry Venus, spokesman for Sen. Bob Dutton, R-Rancho Cucamonga. Dutton is on the Joint Rules Committee and until this week was the Senate minority leader.\par \par \uc2 "They'd have to have someone working the doors 24 hours, or not allow access," Venus said.\par \par \uc2 Assembly Speaker John Perez, D-Los Angeles, thinks the Legislature has made the right choices in safeguarding the Capitol, said spokesman John Vigna.\par \par \uc2 "We do want to make sure our security is as tight as possible," Vigna said. "But at the same time we have to balance the needs of the members and staff to come in and get their work done."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120112e81c00029\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 BOSTON (AP) - A lawyer for President Barack Obama's uncle, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who is charged with drunken driving, said Wednesday that he will ask prosecutors to turn over the driving record of the police officer who stopped him.\par \par \uc2 Onyango Obama, 67, the half brother of the president's late father, was charged with drunken driving in Framingham in August.\par \par \uc2 In a written police report, Officer Val Krishtal said he stopped Obama after Obama rolled through a stop sign and nearly caused his police cruiser to strike Obama's SUV. Krishtal said Obama failed several sobriety tests and blew a reading of 0.14 percent on a blood-alcohol test, which is above the state's legal driving limit of 0.08 percent.\par \par \uc2 Police said that after being booked at the police station, Obama was asked whether he wanted to make a telephone call to arrange for bail. "I think I will call the White House," he stated, according to the police report.\par \par \uc2 Defense attorney P. Scott Bratton, citing a car crash Krishtal had in November, said he plans to ask prosecutors in court Thursday to turn over the portions of Krishtal's personnel file that mention any internal affairs investigation into Krishtal's on-duty driving record.\par \par \uc2 Krishtal was injured Nov. 22 when he lost control of his police cruiser and crashed into a stone wall while responding to reports of gunshots.\par \par \uc2 Framingham police declined to comment Wednesday. A spokeswoman for Middlesex District Attorney Gerry Leone said prosecutors are not opposed to turning over records related to any crashes Krishtal was involved in while on duty. She declined to comment before Thursday's hearing on any police internal affairs reports related to Krishtal's driving record.\par \par \uc2 Obama's lawyer said earlier that he plans to challenge the traffic stop that led to his client's arrest. Bratton maintains that Obama was not committing any motor vehicle violation at the time so police did not have the right to stop him.\par \par \uc2 Obama, who is originally from Kenya, has pleaded not guilty to operating under the influence of alcohol, negligent operation of a motor vehicle and failure to yield the right of way.\par \par \uc2 The president refers in his memoir "Dreams from My Father" to an Uncle Omar, who matches Onyango Obama's background and has the same date of birth.\par \par \uc2 Obama initially was held without bail on a detainer from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials on allegations he violated an order to return to Kenya 20 years ago. He was later released and has been ordered to regularly check in with immigration officials.\par \par \uc2 The White House has said it expects Obama's arrest to be handled like any other case.\par \par \uc2 Onyango Obama is the brother of Zeituni Onyango, the president's aunt, who lives in Boston. Zeituni Onyango came to the United States from Kenya in 2000 and was denied asylum by an immigration judge in 2004. She stayed in the country illegally and was granted asylum in 2010 by a judge who found she could be a target in Kenya.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120111e81b001nu\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

This time the bill would give colleges the option to opt-out of giving illegal immigrants in-state tuition.\par \par \uc2 The out-of-state tuition rate can be three times more expensive than the in-state rate. Supporters of the legislation say the higher rates \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students have to pay is a roadblock to education. Republicans say the bill incentivizes illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 About a dozen states have similar tuition legislation for illegal immigrants, including Illinois, Kansas and Texas.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120111e81b001n0\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) - A bill that would require public schools to verify the immigration status of incoming students is drawing fire from an interest group.\par \par \uc2 The Kansas City Star reported that ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://bit.ly/ySALxV"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://bit.ly/ySALxV}}}\uc2 ) similar laws have been passed in Alabama and Arizona. In both states, federal judges have blocked implementation of parts of the laws, with the U.S. Supreme Court agreeing to hear arguments on Arizona's law. The Supreme Court repeatedly has ruled that children have a right to attend public schools regardless of immigration status.\par \par \uc2 The sponsor of the Missouri legislation, Sen. Will Kraus, a Lee's Summit Republican, said his bill would lead to better tracking but wouldn't keep out students.\par \par \uc2 But Vanessa Crawford, executive director of Missouri Immigration and Refugee Advocates, called the legislation a "really bad idea." Under the bill, schools would be required to ask new students for either a birth certificate or proof they are in the country legally.\par \par \uc2 "This would force police and school officials to act as immigration agents, and would result in innocent people facing harassment," Crawford said. "And passing a law that will undoubtedly end up in court is irresponsible."\par \par \uc2 Kraus said the bill is part of an effort to force Democratic Attorney General Chris Koster to sue the federal government to recoup the cost of enforcing federal immigration laws.\par \par \uc2 "One of the objections we encountered was that there was no known cost to the state. Based on those comments, I asked my office to reach out to state agencies to find out who actually tracked the cost of illegal immigration on Missouri taxpayers," Kraus said. "The results were underwhelming as we found most agencies have no idea of the true cost to taxpayers."\par \par \uc2 The bill, which has not been scheduled for a hearing, would require reporting on the number of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students and how many of them are enrolled in programs to help them learn English. Cost information would be part of the report.\par \par \uc2 Although the bill would bar information about individual students from being released, critics say it would spook families and result in children being pulled out of school.\par \par \uc2 Schools reported an increase in absences among Hispanic students after the Alabama law went into effect. Airick Leonard West, board president of Kansas City Public Schools, said a similar reaction could be expected in Missouri.\par \par \uc2 "At a time when our district needs to gain the trust and cooperation of parents to increase our average daily attendance -- one of the standards of accreditation -- this bill sabotages that effort by creating a hostile and intimidating relationship between our district and its families," West said.\par \par \uc2 The bill also would require law enforcement officers to check immigration status during all stops if they have reasonable cause, and would make failure to carry proper citizenship documentation a state misdemeanor.\par \par \uc2 Kraus said officers already check immigration status after arrests and that his bill simply would extend that to include all stops. He said the new state misdemeanor simply would mirror federal law.\par \par \uc2 "None of these proposed items have any significant punitive provision above what is already in current federal law," Kraus said.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Information from: The Kansas City Star, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.kcstar.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.kcstar.com}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120111e81b001he\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) - The wife of a state lawmaker said Friday she isn't concerned that her husband might have endangered his family by hiding a loaded handgun inside his briefcase because her children know how to handle firearms.\par \par \uc2 State Assemblyman Tim Donnelly was cited with a misdemeanor after Transportation Security Administration screeners found the Colt .45 handgun inside his carry-on luggage Wednesday as he was headed to board a flight at Ontario International Airport, east of Los Angeles.\par \par \uc2 At the time, Donnelly explained that he began carrying the gun after receiving death threats and hid it in his briefcase so his wife would not be alarmed.\par \par \uc2 Rowena Donnelly said she and the couple's five sons know how to shoot and handle guns safely.\par \par \uc2 "For my husband to have the gun there didn't bother me," she told The Associated Press. "We train them, they know that a gun is not a toy."\par \par \uc2 Three of the couple's sons, ages 12 to 18, live at the family's home in the Southern California mountain community of Twin Peaks, while their two older sons live on their own. Had her children found the gun, she said "they would have immediately called their dad to tell him, `Hey Dad, your gun's out.'"\par \par \uc2 Donnelly said he keeps his firearms in a gun safe, but took the Colt .45 to the garage while he was home alone on New Year's Eve. He hid the gun in the briefcase when his wife and children came home.\par \par \uc2 Airport screeners said they found the gun loaded with four bullets, along with a separate magazine with another five rounds.\par \par \uc2 Donnelly and his wife said he became a target for threats over his opposition to illegal immigration. He once headed the Minuteman Civil Defense Corps of California, a vigilante group that patrolled the U.S.-Mexico border in search of people attempting to enter the U.S illegally.\par \par \uc2 This winter, he led a drive seeking to overturn a law that allows \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  college students to receive public financial aid, known as the California Dream Act, though he announced Friday that the effort had failed to gather enough signatures.\par \par \uc2 Donnelly told the AP that he was mentally exhausted from working nonstop on the campaign when he forgot about the gun, but added, "I'm not going to make any excuses."\par \par \uc2 The San Bernardino County district attorney's office was reviewing the citation, said spokesman Christopher Lee. Ontario Airport Police Sgt. Belinda Nettles said police are recommending a misdemeanor charge of possessing a loaded firearm. Authorities said Donnelly does not have a permit to carry a hidden gun.\par \par \uc2 Nettles said there were no circumstances that would merit a more serious charge. "There was no special treatment," she said. "We don't provide special treatment for celebrities\par \par \uc2 The couple said in separate interviews that they both became concerned after a man charged at the assemblyman while they were gathering referendum signatures the day after Christmas. The man shouted threats, but was restrained by other campaign volunteers.\par \par \uc2 "It was pretty scary. I didn't really think anything of it until I remembered the incident in Arizona and the congresswoman," Rowena Donnelly said, referring to U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who was wounded by a shot to the head a year ago. "There are some crazies out there."\par \par \uc2 Donnelly didn't report the incident or several emailed threats until after his gun was confiscated at the airport. He denied intending to bring the weapon to Sacramento and said he had never brought a gun to the state Capitol.\par \par \uc2 Spokesmen for the California Highway Patrol and state Assembly said there is no indication Donnelly ever tried to bring a weapon into the Capitol. However, they are reviewing whether Donnelly needs protection, said Ronald E. Pane, the Assembly's chief sergeant-at-arms.\par \par \uc2 Donnelly described the airport encounter, saying the screener made friendly comments that she recognized him as an assemblyman and the leading opponent of the Dream Act. Then "her face turned to horror" when she saw the weapon on her screening monitor, he said.\par \par \uc2 "They were very professional and they determined I was not a threat," he said. "Once they determined I was not a threat, I was a guy on his way to work who made an honest mistake. There was no need to book me."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120107e817000f8\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 DALLAS (AP) - A Texas teenager who was deported to Colombia in May after claiming to be an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  was returned to the United States and remains at the center of an international mystery over how a minor could be sent to a country where she is not a citizen.\par \par \uc2 Her family has questioned why U.S. officials didn't do more to verify her identity and say she is not fluent in Spanish and had no ties to Colombia. While many facts of the case involving Jakadrien Lorece Turner remain unclear, U.S. and Colombian officials have pointed fingers over who is responsible.\par \par \uc2 Jakadrien, 15, arrived in Dallas on Friday evening and was reunited with her family. She was flanked by her mother, grandmother and law enforcement when she emerged from the international gate at \uc2 Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport\uc2  shortly before 10 p.m.\par \par \uc2 "She's happy to be home," the family's attorney, Ray Jackson, said, adding that the family would not be issuing any statements Friday night.\par \par \uc2 He said the family was "ecstatic" to have Jakadrien back in Texas and they plan to "do what we can to make sure she gets back to a normal life."\par \par \uc2 Immigration experts say that while cases of mistaken identity are rare, people can slip through the cracks, especially if they don't have legal help or family members working on their behalf. But they say U.S. immigration authorities had the responsibility to determine if a person is a citizen.\par \par \uc2 "Often in these situations they have these group hearings where they tell everybody you're going to be deported," said Jacqueline Stevens, a political science professor at Northwestern University, who is an expert on immigration issues. "Everything is really quick, even if you understand English you wouldn't understand what is going on. If she were in that situation as a 14-year-old she would be herded through like cattle and not have a chance to talk to the judge about her situation."\par \par \uc2 Jakadrien's saga began when the teen ran away more than a year ago. Jakadrien's family said she left home in November 2010. Houston police said the girl was arrested on April 2, 2011, for misdemeanor theft in that city and claimed to be Tika Lanay Cortez, a Colombian woman born in 1990. It was unclear if she has been living under that name.\par \par \uc2 Houston police said in a statement that her name was run through a database to determine if she was wanted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement but the results were negative. She was then turned over to the Harris County jail and booked on the theft charge.\par \par \uc2 The county sheriff's office said it ran her through the available databases and did the interviews necessary to establish her identity and immigration status in the country, with negative results. A sheriff's office employee recommended that an immigration detainer be put on her, and upon her release from jail she was turned over to ICE.\par \par \uc2 U.S. immigration officials insist they followed procedure and found nothing to indicate that the girl wasn't a Colombian woman living illegally in the country.\par \par \uc2 An ICE official said the teen claimed to be Cortez throughout the criminal proceedings in Houston and the ensuing deportation process, in which an immigration judge ultimately ordered her back to Colombia.\par \par \uc2 Standard procedure before any deportation is to coordinate with the other country in order to establish that person is from there, the ICE official said.\par \par \uc2 The ICE official, speaking on condition of anonymity due to not being authorized to discuss additional details of the case, said the teenager was interviewed by a representative from the Colombian consulate and that country's government issued her a travel document to enter Colombia.\par \par \uc2 Jakadrien was issued travel documents at the request of U.S. officials using information they provided, the Colombian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said. Colombian officials are investigating what kind of verification was conducted by its Houston consulate to issue the temporary passport.\par \par \uc2 The girl was given Colombian citizenship upon arriving in that country, the ICE official said.\par \par \uc2 According to the Colombian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the girl was enrolled in the country's "Welcome Home" program after she arrived there. She was given shelter, psychological assistance and a job at a call center, a statement from the agency said.\par \par \uc2 "If she looked like an adult, and she told them she was a 21-year-old Colombian citizen, and she didn't show up in their databases, this was inevitable," said Albert Armendariz, an immigration attorney from El Paso.\par \par \uc2 Jakadrien's family says they have no idea why she ended up in Colombia. Johnisa Turner said the girl is a U.S. citizen who was born in Dallas and was not fluent in Spanish. She said neither she nor the teen's father had ties to Colombia. Jakadrien's grandmother, Lorene Turner, called the deportation a "big mistake somebody made."\par \par \uc2 "She looks like a kid, she acts like a kid. How could they think she wasn't a kid?" Lorene Turner asked on Thursday.\par \par \uc2 Lorene Turner, a Dallas hairstylist, said she spent a lot of time on the Internet trying to track down Jakadrien.\par \par \uc2 Ultimately, the girl was found in Bogota by the Dallas Police Department with help from Colombian and U.S. officials.\par \par \uc2 Dallas Police detective C'mon (pronounced Simone) Wingo, the detective in charge of the case, said she was contacted in August by the girl's grandmother, who said Jakadrien had posted "kind of disturbing" messages on a \uc2 Facebook\uc2  account where she goes by yet another name.\par \par \uc2 Wingo said the girl was located in early November through her use of a computer to log into \uc2 Facebook\uc2 . Relatives were then put into contact with the U.S. embassy in Bogota to provide pictures and documents to prove Jakadrien's identity.\par \par \uc2 Colombian officials said when the government discovered she was a U.S. citizen and a minor, it put her under the care of a welfare program.\par \par \uc2 State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said the case was brought to the State Department's attention in mid-December.\par \par \uc2 "We didn't have any involvement at all in this case until it came to light that there may be a problem with an American minor in Colombia, and that -- and then we became involved both with Colombian authorities and with folks in Dallas," Nuland said.\par \par \uc2 Stephen Yale-Loehr, who teaches immigration law at Cornell Law School, said hundreds of U.S. citizens are wrongfully detained or deported each year.\par \par \uc2 "There are a variety of legitimate reasons why somebody might not appear to be a U.S. citizen at first glance." he said. "It's the duty of the U.S. federal immigration agency to make sure that we do not detain and deport U.S. citizens erroneously. And this, unfortunately happened in this case."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120107e817000by\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) - The Obama administration wants to more quickly reunite Americans with their \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  spouses and children in a move long sought by advocates but panned by Republicans as a way to push unpopular policies around Congress.\par \par \uc2 Currently, many illegal immigrants must leave the country before they can ask the federal government to waive a three- to 10-year ban on legally coming back to the U.S. The length of the ban depends on how long they have lived in the U.S. without permission.\par \par \uc2 On Friday, the Obama administration proposed changing the rule to let children and spouses ask the government to decide on the waiver request before they head to their home country to seek a visa to return here legally.\par \par \uc2 The illegal immigrants would still have to go abroad to finish the visa process, but getting a provisional waiver approved in advance would reduce the time they are out of the country from months to days or weeks, said Alejandro Mayorkas, director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.\par \par \uc2 The purpose is "to minimize the extent to which bureaucratic delays separate Americans from their families for long periods of time," Mayorkas told reporters.\par \par \uc2 It currently takes about six months for the government to issue a waiver, Mayorkas said.\par \par \uc2 The waiver shift is the latest move by President Barack Obama to make changes to immigration policy without congressional action. Congressional Republicans repeatedly have criticized the administration for policy changes they describe as providing "backdoor amnesty" to illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 The proposal also comes as Obama gears up for a re-election contest in which the support of Hispanic voters could prove a determining factor in a number of states. The administration hopes to change the rule later this year after taking public comments.\par \par \uc2 Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, on Friday accused the president of putting the interests of illegal immigrants ahead of those of Americans.\par \par \uc2 "It seems President Obama plays by his own rules to push unpopular policies on the American people," the House Judiciary Committee chair said in a statement.\par \par \uc2 Immigrants who do not have criminal records and who have only violated immigration laws can win a waiver if they can prove their absence would cause an extreme hardship for their American spouse or parent. The government received about 23,000 hardship applications in 2011 and more than 70 percent were approved.\par \par \uc2 About 75 percent of the applications were filed by Mexicans, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.\par \par \uc2 Immigrant advocates have long complained about the current system, which can split up families for months or years. And since there's no guarantee a person will win a waiver to return, many immigrant families refuse to take the risk of going abroad to apply for one.\par \par \uc2 Laura Barajas, a 42-year-old stay-at-home mom in Orange County, Calif., is due to travel to Ciudad Juarez in two weeks to try to get her papers. She and her U.S. citizen husband are trying to stay positive, but she is afraid to leave him and their two young children behind.\par \par \uc2 "I don't want to be separated for a long time from my children," said Barajas, who came to the U.S. illegally to find work, then met her future husband and stayed. "I'm not going to risk taking them to a place that I don't even know after 18 years."\par \par \uc2 Pro-immigration activists and lawyers embraced the change, saying it would keep families together and encourage more people now in the United States illegally to emerge from the shadows and apply for visas. Some said it could even save lives.\par \par \uc2 Rep. Jared Polis, D-Colo., recalled the case of Tania Nava Palacios, who went to Ciudad Juarez -- a hotbed for drug-fueled violence -- with her American husband and son in pursuit of a waiver. Drug cartel members killed her husband last year, his office said in a statement.\par \par \uc2 Kelly Alfaro, of Washington state, said her husband, Guillermo, waited in Mexico for eight months last year after he had his visa interview in Ciudad Juarez.\par \par \uc2 "I was terrified for his safety because I know how dangerous it is there and I had no way of knowing how long he would have to stay in Mexico," she said.\par \par \uc2 Democratic lawmakers welcomed the Obama administration's move to change the immigration system by rulemaking after efforts at a legislative overhaul failed.\par \par \uc2 "Has it taken a while? Yes. Is it happening? Yes," said Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., who has encouraged such changes. "Am I looking forward to telling people to vote for him? Absolutely."\par \par \uc2 Immigration has become a difficult issue for Obama ahead of the November election. As a presidential candidate, he pledged to change what many consider to be a broken immigration system.\par \par \uc2 To that end, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano announced plans last year to review some 300,000 pending deportation cases in an effort to target criminal illegal immigrants, repeat immigration law violators and those who pose a national security or public safety threat.\par \par \uc2 Napolitano said the DHS would delay indefinitely the cases of many illegal immigrants who have no criminal record and those who have been arrested for only minor traffic violations or other misdemeanors. A pilot program is under way to begin reviewing the case.\par \par \uc2 Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director John Morton also issued a memo in June outlining how immigration authorities could use discretion in deciding which illegal immigrants to arrest and put into deportation proceedings.\par \par \uc2 Congressional Republicans have decried the policy changes, arguing that the Obama administration is circumventing Congress.\par \par \uc2 Several attempts at an immigration law overhaul have failed in recent years, including the so-called DREAM Act, which would have allowed for some young illegal immigrants brought to the U.S. as children to earn legal status if they went to college or joined the military.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Taxin reported from Santa Ana, Calif. Associated Press writers Elliot Spagat in San Diego and Alicia Caldwell in Washington, D.C., contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120107e81700063\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) - The attempt to block a California law that allows public financial aid for college students who are in the country illegally has failed to collect enough signatures to qualify for the ballot, the leading proponent said Friday.\par \par \uc2 Opponents fell short by about 57,000 signatures, said state Assemblyman Tim Donnelly, who led the repeal effort. They needed more than 500,000 registered voter signatures to try to overturn the law.\par \par \uc2 When the law takes effect next year, it will allow illegal immigrants to apply for state-funded college scholarships and aid at public universities. A second portion of what is known as the California Dream Act took effect this year and allows private scholarships and loans for students who are illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 "This is disappointing news, but it is no less of a warning to Governor (Jerry) Brown and every Democrat legislator who voted to create a new entitlement program for illegals while the state still has a budget deficit over $9 billion, and cannot even meet its obligation to legal California students," Donnelly, R-Twin Peaks, said in a statement.\par \par \uc2 California already allows \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students to pay in-state college tuition if they graduate from a California high school and can prove they are on the path to legalize their immigration status. They cannot, however, apply for public or private financial aid.\par \par \uc2 Proponents said the two-part Dream Act shows California is more progressive than other states that are trying to punish illegal immigrants. The bills are different from the proposed federal Dream Act, which would include a path to citizenship for the children of illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 "The lesson is clear. California is a state that leads our nation forward, not backward," said Assemblyman Gil Cedillo, D-Los Angeles, who authored both parts of the California law.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 EDINBURG, Texas (AP) - A competitive marksman was charged Friday in a shooting last month in which two teens were severely wounded during basketball tryouts behind their South Texas middle school -- a shooting the local sheriff portrayed as unintentional but "very reckless."\par \par \uc2 Dustin Wesley Cook, who was shooting targets with a friend on ranchland adjacent to Harwell Middle School on Dec. 12, was arraigned on a charge of second-degree felony aggravated assault. He was only charged in the shooting of 14-year-old Edson Amaro. Investigators haven't been able to test the bullet that wounded 13-year-old Nicholas Tijerina because it's lodged near his spine.\par \par \uc2 Cook's attorney, Michael Guerra, said that when the details of what transpired are made public, they will show Cook "didn't have any criminal responsibility, whatsoever." He said Cook is a parent and has been praying for the boys and their families.\par \par \uc2 But at a news conference after the hearing, Hidalgo County Sheriff Lupe Trevino said Cook, an experienced marksman, should have known better.\par \par \uc2 "We do not believe that Mr. Cook went out there and intentionally and knowingly discharged this weapon intending to shoot or injure a child, but he did do it in a very reckless manner," Trevino said. "By his own admission he knew that at the end of his targets, beyond his targets in a direct line was Harwell Middle School."\par \par \uc2 The school only opened in the fall, but police investigated a report of gunshots near the school before the students were wounded and investigated another report Friday that led to the school being locked down again.\par \par \uc2 School district Superintendent Rene Gutierrez on Friday called on state lawmakers to ban hunting and the use of high-powered rifles and weapons within three miles of schools.\par \par \uc2 "Our students throughout the state are going to continue to be at risk if we don't do something about it," Gutierrez said.\par \par \uc2 Classes were finished on the day of the shootings, but there were about 50 students trying out for the basketball team behind the school, where two hoops were set up because the gym was being used. Nicholas, the younger boy, was going for layup when he was shot. Between 20 and 30 seconds later Edson, who had been sitting on a curb waiting his turn, was hit. They were about 15 feet apart, Trevino said.\par \par \uc2 Edson lost a kidney and shortly before Christmas, Nicholas' doctor said the boy was unable to move his legs, at least for the time being. Trevino said there was talk of sending Tijerina to a hospital in Houston where the bullet could be removed. If that happened, investigators would try to make a second ballistics match, he said.\par \par \uc2 Authorities questioned three men they found on the adjacent ranchland after the shooting, including Cook and his friend, who were shooting targets about a mile from the school.\par \par \uc2 Cook had shot there before and had targets set at 100 and 300 yards in a line. It was not a certified firing range and did not include any protective berms that would keep stray bullets capable of traveling up to three miles from escaping. Cook was using a tactical rifle that fires a .308-caliber Winchester round -- the preferred type of sniper rifle used in the U.S. military and police agencies, including the sheriff's office, Trevino said.\par \par \uc2 "The damning indictment here is that we have two targets that ... align the shooter with the children, the ultimate targets," Trevino said. "This is very damning and very telling."\par \par \uc2 Investigators also have a log that Cook kept of his shots. It shows he took five shots at 4:38 p.m. Trevino said authorities received the first emergency calls around 4:45 p.m.\par \par \uc2 The third piece of evidence is a ballistics report matching the bullet pulled from Amaro to Cook's rifle. Cook and the other man, who authorities have not publicly identified, told investigators they did not shoot each other's weapons, Trevino said.\par \par \uc2 "I need the public to know that this was not a deranged shooter out there shooting children or ... some careless hunter shooting in the direction of a school, but it was a target shooter," he said.\par \par \uc2 Authorities said after the shooting that they had detained three armed men from adjacent ranchland. Cook and the man he was with were released. The third man, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  with an assault rifle, according to authorities, was eventually charged with misdemeanor trespass and poaching, though those charges were dropped this week.\par \par \uc2 Trevino said he asked prosecutors to drop the charges against that man because he would likely be facing federal weapons charges and could be needed as a witness in a related drug case. He also said subsequent evidence appeared to indicate that the landowner had given him permission to be on the property.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120106e816001ov\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 JEFFERSONVILLE, Ind. (AP) - A former financial counselor at a southern Indiana hospital faces charges alleging that he stole nearly $1,500 from a cancer patient after telling the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  she wouldn't get chemotherapy treatments unless she paid him first.\par \par \uc2 Arsalan Haq, 32, of Louisville, Ky., faces five counts of felony theft and one misdemeanor count of intimidation. He was released from jail Wednesday after posting $1,000 bond. His attorney, Brad Jacobs, said he still needs to discuss the allegations with his client, who offers a different account of the events.\par \par \uc2 The News and Tribune reports ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://bit.ly/wAxz6N"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://bit.ly/wAxz6N}}}\uc2  ) that Haq was a financial counselor at Clark Memorial Hospital in Jeffersonville but was dismissed after the allegations arose.\par \par \uc2 According to a probable-cause affidavit, the patient told police Dec. 28 that she was diagnosed with cancer in July and then referred to Haq because she doesn't have insurance. The woman said that when she told Haq she could make payments for her treatments, he replied that she could not receive treatments unless she paid the full amount, the affidavit states.\par \par \uc2 She said Haq told her to apply for Medicaid, but that when she responded that Medicaid is only for Americans and that she is not in the country legally he said that's not true because he has "contacts."\par \par \uc2 The affidavit states that Haq contacted the woman in September and asked her to pay $300 cash. A week later, he allegedly demanded $400. When she said it would be difficult to make that payment, he asked if she wanted treatment or not, according to the documents. He also allegedly told her she had to pay money for application fees and paperwork because she is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors say Haq continued to demand money, saying that otherwise her treatment would end. He even met her at a market to collect money, according to the affidavit. In total, she made four payments totaling $1,495, the affidavit states.\par \par \uc2 After the woman asked a friend for financial help the friend told her the situation was not the way that hospitals work. The woman then met with hospital representatives Dec. 5 and told them about the payments. At that point the hospital provided her with $205 to pay Haq.\par \par \uc2 The affidavit states that an audio recorder program was activated on the woman's cell phone to record her conversation with Haq and a hidden video camera was set up at the hospital, which allegedly captured the woman making a payment to Haq.\par \par \uc2 According to the affidavit, a Clark County detective observed the video showing the woman hand Haq paper money, which he then placed in a drawer at his work station. Haq is then seen taking the money from the drawer and putting it in his pants pocket.\par \par \uc2 Jacobs said he still must see the video and talk with his client.\par \par \uc2 "His version of events differs greatly from what's in the report," Jacobs said.\par \par \uc2 Clark County Chief Deputy Prosecutor Jeremy Mull said Haq was immediately terminated by the hospital, and the sheriff's department was contacted.\par \par \uc2 "Unfortunately, it's not uncommon for people to take advantage of immigrants who don't speak the language or aren't familiar with American customs," Mull said.\par \par \uc2 Martin Padgett, president and CEO of Clark Memorial Hospital, said in a statement Thursday that the hospital "is dedicated to providing quality health care to all of our patients, without regard for ability to pay."\par \par \uc2 "We are sorry that a patient and their family has had an unfortunate situation with one of our team members during an extremely difficult time for them," he said.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Information from: News and Tribune, Jeffersonville, Ind., {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.newsandtribune.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.newsandtribune.com}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120106e816001k5\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc88}{\*\bkmkend toc88}\b \uc2 Obama administration plans change for some immigrants applying for legal status\b0\par\par\uc2 By LUIS ALONSO LUGO and AMY TAXIN   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 969 \uc2 words\par \uc2 6 January 2012\par 17:21\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2012.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) - The Obama administration proposed a rule change Friday to reduce the time that \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  spouses and children are separated from their American relatives while they try to gain legal status in the United States.\par \par \uc2 Currently, many illegal immigrants must leave the country before they can ask the government to waive a three- to 10-year ban on legally coming back to the U.S. The length of the ban depends on how long they have lived in the U.S. without permission.\par \par \uc2 The new rule would let children and spouses of citizens ask the government to decide on the waiver request before they head to their home country to apply for a visa.\par \par \uc2 The illegal immigrants would still have to go abroad to finish the visa process, but getting a provisional waiver approved in advance would reduce the time they are out of the country from months to days or weeks, said Alejandro Mayorkas, director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.\par \par \uc2 The purpose is "to minimize the extent to which bureaucratic delays separate Americans from their families for long periods of time," Mayorkas told reporters.\par \par \uc2 The waiver shift is the latest move by President Barack Obama to make changes to immigration policy without congressional action. Congressional Republicans repeatedly have criticized the administration for policy changes they describe as providing "backdoor amnesty" to illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 The proposal also comes as Obama gears up for a re-election contest in which the support of Hispanic voters could prove a determining factor in a number of states. The administration hopes to change the rule later this year after taking public comments.\par \par \uc2 Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, on Friday accused the president of putting the interests of illegal immigrants ahead of those of Americans.\par \par \uc2 "It seems President Obama plays by his own rules to push unpopular policies on the American people," the House Judiciary Committee chair said in a statement.\par \par \uc2 Immigrants who do not have criminal records and who have only violated immigration laws can win a waiver if they can prove their absence would cause an extreme hardship for their American spouse or parent. The government received about 23,000 hardship applications in 2011 and more than 70 percent were approved.\par \par \uc2 It currently takes about six months for the government to issue a waiver, Mayorkas said.\par \par \uc2 Immigrant advocates have long complained about the current system, which can split up families for months or years. And since there's no guarantee a person will win a waiver to return, many immigrant families refuse to take the risk of going abroad to apply for one.\par \par \uc2 Laura Barajas, a 42-year-old stay-at-home mom in Orange County, Calif., is due to travel to Ciudad Juarez in two weeks to try to get her papers. She and her U.S. citizen husband are trying to stay positive, but she is afraid to leave him and their two young children behind.\par \par \uc2 "I don't want to be separated for a long time from my children," said Barajas, who came to the U.S. illegally to find work, then met her future husband and stayed. "I'm not going to risk taking them to a place that I don't even know after 18 years."\par \par \uc2 Pro-immigration activists and lawyers embraced the change, saying it would keep families together and encourage more people in the United States illegally to emerge from the shadows and apply for visas. Some called for the change to be extended to spouses and children of legal residents, not just U.S. citizens.\par \par \uc2 Kelly Alfaro, of Washington state, said her husband, Guillermo, waited in Mexico for eight months last year after he had his visa interview in Ciudad Juarez, a hotbed for drug-fueled violence.\par \par \uc2 "I was terrified for his safety because I know how dangerous it is there and I had no way of knowing how long he would have to stay in Mexico," she said.\par \par \uc2 Democratic lawmakers welcomed the Obama administration's move to change the immigration system by rulemaking after efforts at a legislative overhaul failed.\par \par \uc2 "Has it taken a while? Yes. Is it happening? Yes," said Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., who has encouraged such changes. "Am I looking forward to telling people to vote for him? Absolutely."\par \par \uc2 Immigration has become a difficult issue for Obama ahead of the November election. As a presidential candidate, he pledged to change what many consider to be a broken immigration system.\par \par \uc2 To that end, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano announced plans last year to review some 300,000 pending deportation cases in an effort to target criminal illegal immigrants, repeat immigration law violators and those who pose a national security or public safety threat.\par \par \uc2 Napolitano said the DHS would delay indefinitely the cases of many illegal immigrants who have no criminal record and those who have been arrested for only minor traffic violations or other misdemeanors. A pilot program is under way to begin reviewing the case.\par \par \uc2 Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director John Morton also issued a memo in June outlining how immigration authorities could use discretion in deciding which illegal immigrants to arrest and put into deportation proceedings.\par \par \uc2 Congressional Republicans have decried the policy changes, arguing that the Obama administration is circumventing Congress.\par \par \uc2 Several attempts at an immigration law overhaul have failed in recent years, including the so-called DREAM Act, which would have allowed for some young illegal immigrants brought to the U.S. as children to earn legal status if they went to college or joined the military.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Taxin reported from Santa Ana, Calif.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Friday, January 6, 2012\par \par \uc2 US ended year with a surge of hiring, adding 200,000 jobs; unemployment rate at 8.5 percent\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) -- Four painful years after the Great Recession struck and wiped out 8.7 million jobs, the United States may finally be in an elusive pattern known as a virtuous cycle -- an escalating loop of hiring and spending.\par \par \uc2 The nation added 200,000 jobs in December in a burst of hiring that drove the unemployment rate down two notches to 8.5 percent, its lowest in almost three years, and led economists to conclude that the improvement in the job market might just last.\par \par \uc2 "There is more horsepower to this economy than most believe," said Sung Won Sohn, an economics professor at California State University, Channel Islands. "The stars are aligned right for a meaningful economic recovery."\par \par \uc2 It was the sixth month in a row that the economy added at least 100,000 jobs, the longest streak since 2006. The economy added jobs every month last year, the first time that has happened since 2005.\par \par \uc2 And the unemployment rate, which peaked at 10 percent in October 2009 and stood at 9.1 percent in August, has fallen four months straight. It was 8.7 percent in November.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Analysis: The good news on jobs gives Obama a campaign story line to run on, at least for now\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) -- The promising drop in unemployment on Friday looks like a job-security bonus for President Barack Obama as well, undercutting Republicans' assertions that his economic policies have failed. The president himself heralded the news with his most confident assessment yet.\par \par \uc2 "We're starting to rebound," he declared. "We're moving in the right direction."\par \par \uc2 It's still 10 months until Election Day, and while the narrative is positive for Obama now, the economy could still turn sour again. The Republicans who want his job were giving him no credit on Friday, and Rick Santorum even suggested hiring was improving because business owners figured Obama was on his way out.\par \par \uc2 But December's 8.5 percent jobless rate -- down from 8.7 in November and 9 percent in October -- gives Obama a positive story line through the Republican presidential primaries in January and underscores other bright spots emerging on the economic scene for his yearlong fight for re-election.\par \par \uc2 More good economic news: The average workweek lengthened, average hourly pay rose and the length of time people spent unemployed also declined. To some economists the data indicated the economy was approaching "escape velocity" -- the space age term to describe the ability of a recovery to sustain itself and break away from a recession's gravitational pull.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 A debate doubleheader in New Hampshire -- but Romney rivals already looking to SC to slow him\par \par \uc2 MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- Despite this weekend's debate doubleheader in New Hampshire, Mitt Romney's rivals all but conceded defeat Friday in the state's primary next week, looking instead to South Carolina as their best chance to slow his march to the Republican presidential nomination.\par \par \uc2 Romney campaigned in both states, prominent party leaders by his side, President Barack Obama on his mind.\par \par \uc2 Giving no ground when the government reported the creation of 200,000 new jobs in December, Romney said America deserves better than the economic results Obama has delivered. "Thirty-five consecutive months of unemployment above 8 percent is no cause for celebration," he said in a written statement.\par \par \uc2 Republican rivals Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich were no more inclined to applaud Obama for the drop in unemployment to its lowest level in nearly three years. But they had other worries, including a new survey that suggested Romney's narrow victory this week in Iowa's caucuses has sent his support soaring in South Carolina.\par \par \uc2 The three men share a debate stage Saturday night and again Sunday morning with the other three surviving contenders, Texas Rep. Ron Paul, Texas Gov., Rick Perry and former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Explosion in Syrian capital kills 25; government blames suicide bomber targeting police\par \par \uc2 BEIRUT (AP) -- A bomb exploded Friday at a busy Damascus intersection, killing 25 people and wounding dozens in the second major attack in the Syrian capital in as many weeks, officials said, vowing to respond to further security threats with an "iron fist."\par \par \uc2 The government blamed "terrorists," saying a suicide bomber had blown himself up in the crowded Midan district. But the country's opposition demanded an independent investigation, accusing forces loyal to the Syrian regime of being behind the bombing to tarnish a 10-month-old uprising against President Bashar Assad.\par \par \uc2 "Is there anything worse than these crimes?" said Majida Jomaa, a 30-year-old housewife who ran to the streets after hearing the explosion around 11 a.m. "Is this freedom?"\par \par \uc2 It was impossible to determine the exact target of the blast, but a police bus was riddled with shrapnel and blood was splattered on its seats, according to Syrian TV video and a government official. Blood also stained the street, which was littered with shattered glass.\par \par \uc2 The bomber "detonated himself with the aim of killing the largest number of people," Interior Minister Mohammed Shaar told reporters. State media said most of the dead were civilians but security forces were also among them.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Santorum says debt crisis demands immediate cuts in Social Security, even if it hurts\par \par \uc2 KEENE, N.H. (AP) -- Risking the wrath of older voters, Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum is calling for immediate cuts to Social Security benefits and says the country can't wait to phase in reductions as most of his rivals have advocated.\par \par \uc2 "We can't wait 10 years," even though "everybody wants to," Santorum told a crowd while campaigning in New Hampshire Friday, breaking with opponents who say immediate cuts would be too big a shock to current and soon-to-be retirees.\par \par \uc2 Calling for cuts in Social Security often triggers strong opposition, and politicians typically suggest phase-in periods of up to a decade when broaching the topic.\par \par \uc2 Santorum, who was trying to leverage his strong Iowa showing in New Hampshire, argued that everyone must sacrifice now because the nation's "house is on fire" with soaring federal debt. He argued that he is being courageous and honest by telling Americans they can't afford to wait to rein in Social Security's growing costs. And he said he anticipated possible attack ads on his position, four days ahead of New Hampshire's GOP primary.\par \par \uc2 He made a similar pitch last week in Fort Dodge, Iowa, when he was getting little attention in the GOP race -- and before he came from the back of the pack to nearly win the Iowa caucuses.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 US scraps 8-decades-old FBI definition of rape, to count more people as victims, including men\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Obama administration on Friday expanded the FBI's more than eight-decade-old definition of rape to count men as victims for the first time and to drop the requirement that victims must have physically resisted their attackers.\par \par \uc2 The new definition will increase the number of people counted as rape victims in FBI statistics, but it will not change federal or state laws or alter charges or prosecutions.\par \par \uc2 The White House said the change was not motivated by the recent Penn State child sex-abuse scandal. The expansion has been long awaited because policymakers and lawmakers use crime statistics to allocate resources for prevention and victim assistance.\par \par \uc2 Senior White House adviser Valerie Jarrett called the change a "very, very important step." The issue got top-level White House attention starting last July, when Vice President Joe Biden raised it at a Cabinet meeting.\par \par \uc2 Biden, author of the Violence Against Women Act when he was in the Senate, said the new definition is a victory for women and men "whose suffering has gone unaccounted for over 80 years." Calling rape a "devastating crime," the vice president said, "We can't solve it unless we know the full extent of it."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 US warship Tehran wanted out of Persian Gulf rescues Iranians taken hostage by pirates\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) -- A U.S. Navy destroyer has rescued an Iranian fishing boat that had been commandeered by suspected pirates just days after Tehran warned the U.S. to keep its warships out of the Persian Gulf.\par \par \uc2 American forces flying off the guided-missile destroyer USS Kidd responded to a distress call from the Iranian vessel, the Al Molai, which had been held captive for more than 40 days, the U.S. Navy said Friday. The Kidd was sailing in the Arabian Sea, after leaving the Persian Gulf, when it came to the sailors' aid.\par \par \uc2 A U.S. Navy team boarded the ship Thursday and detained 15 suspected Somali pirates.

The checklist gained great fame as part of a key dramatic scene in the 1995 film "Apollo 13" in which actor Tom Hanks plays Lovell making the calculations.\par \par \uc2 After the sale, NASA contacted Heritage to ask whether Lovell had title to the checklist. Greg Rohan, president of Dallas-based Heritage, said Thursday the sale has been suspended pending the outcome of the inquiry. The checklist, he said, is being stored for now in the company's vault.\par \par \uc2 Rohan said Lovell provided a signed affidavit that he had clear title to the ring-bound checklist, which is standard procedure.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 DALLAS (AP) - A 15-year-old Texas girl who was deported in May to South America after claiming to be an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  was back in the United States and will be in Dallas on Friday evening, her mother said.\par \par \uc2 Johnisa Turner told the Associated Press that her daughter, Jakadrien Lorece Turner, was on a flight from Atlanta. She had said earlier that she planned to meet her daughter when she arrives in the city and that she has "a gazillion questions" for Jakadrien.\par \par \uc2 "Our day has been hectic, hers is too," Turner said, "just as long as she makes it home, just as long as she gets here."\par \par \uc2 The teen has become the center of an international mystery. Many facts of the case are still unclear, but U.S. and Colombia officials have pointed fingers over who is responsible for allowing a minor be deported to a country where she is not a citizen.\par \par \uc2 Jakadrien's family has questioned why U.S. officials didn't do more to verify her identify, while U.S. immigration officials insist they followed procedure and found nothing to indicate that the girl wasn't -- as she claimed -- a woman from Colombia illegally living in the U.S.\par \par \uc2 State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said the case was brought to the State Department's attention in mid-December.\par \par \uc2 "We didn't have any involvement at all in this case until it came to light that there may be a problem with an American minor in Colombia, and that -- and then we became involved both with Colombian authorities and with folks in Dallas," Nuland said.\par \par \uc2 The teen, who ran away from home more than a year ago, was found in Bogota, Colombia, by the Dallas Police Department with help from Colombian and U.S. officials.\par \par \uc2 According to the Colombian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the girl was enrolled in the country's "Welcome Home" program after she arrived there. She was given shelter, psychological assistance and a job at a call center, a statement from the agency said. When the Colombian government discovered she was a U.S. citizen and a minor, it put her under the care of a welfare program, the statement said.\par \par \uc2 The family says they have no idea why she ended up in Colombia. Johnisa Turner said Jakadrien is a U.S. citizen who was born in Dallas and was not fluent in Spanish. She said neither she nor the teen's father had ties to Colombia. Jakadrien's grandmother, Lorene Turner, called the deportation a "big mistake somebody made."\par \par \uc2 "She looks like a kid, she acts like a kid. How could they think she wasn't a kid?" Lorene Turner asked on Thursday.\par \par \uc2 Jakadrien's family said she left home in November 2010. Houston police said the girl was arrested on April 2, 2011, for misdemeanor theft in that city and claimed to be Tika Lanay Cortez, a Colombian woman born in 1990.\par \par \uc2 An Immigration and Customs Enforcement official told The Associated Press on Thursday that the teen claimed to be Cortez throughout the criminal proceedings in Houston and the ensuing deportation process in which an immigration judge ultimately ordered her back to Colombia.\par \par \uc2 The ICE official, speaking on condition of anonymity due to not being authorized to discuss additional details of the case, said the teenager was interviewed by a representative from the Colombian consulate and that country's government issued her a travel document to enter Colombia. The ICE official said standard procedure before any deportation is to coordinate with the other country in order to establish that person is from there.\par \par \uc2 The girl was given Colombian citizenship upon arriving there, the ICE official said.\par \par \uc2 The Colombian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Jakadrien was issued travel documents at the request of the U.S. National Security Agency and with information submitted by U.S. officials. Colombian officials are investigating what kind of verification was conducted by its Houston consulate to issue the temporary passport.\par \par \uc2 It was not clear if the teen might be charged upon her return for falsifying her identity in a criminal process.\par \par \uc2 Dallas Police detective C'mon (pronounced Simone) Wingo, the detective in charge of the case, explained that in August she was contacted by the girl's grandmother, who said Jakadrien had posted "kind of disturbing" messages on a \uc2 Facebook\uc2  account where she goes by yet another name.\par \par \uc2 Wingo said the girl was located in early November through her use of a computer to log into \uc2 Facebook\uc2 . Relatives were then put into contact with the U.S. embassy in Bogota to provide pictures and documents to prove Jakadrien's identity.\par \par \uc2 Lorene Turner, the girl's grandmother, said she has spent a lot of time tracking down Jakadrien.\par \par \uc2 "She didn't have any reason to leave," Lorene Turner said. "She lived in a nice home (with her mother and stepfather). We were very close. I don't know why she left."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Llorca reported from El Paso, Texas.

The nation added 200,000 jobs in December in a burst of hiring that drove the unemployment rate down two notches to 8.5 percent, its lowest in almost three years, and led economists to conclude that the improvement in the job market might just last.\par \par \uc2 All but conceding NH, Romney's rivals look to SC\par \par \uc2 MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- Mitt Romney's rivals are all but conceding defeat in next Tuesday's New Hampshire primary, looking past a weekend debate doubleheader in the Granite State and focusing on South Carolina as their best chance to slow his march to the Republican presidential nomination. Romney campaigned in both states on Friday, prominent party leaders by his side, President Barack Obama on his mind.\par \par \uc2 Bombing in Syrian capital of Damascus kills 25\par \par \uc2 BEIRUT (AP) -- A bomb exploded Friday at a busy Damascus intersection, killing 25 people and wounding dozens in the second major attack in the Syrian capital in as many weeks, officials said, vowing to respond to further security threats with an "iron fist." The government blamed "terrorists," saying a suicide bomber had blown himself up in the crowded Midan district. But the country's opposition demanded an independent investigation, accusing forces loyal to the Syrian regime of being behind the bombing to tarnish a 10-month-old uprising against President Bashar Assad.\par \par \uc2 Gov't defends core of health care overhaul\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Obama administration defended the health care overhaul in a filing Friday with the Supreme Court that calls the law an appropriate response to a "crisis in the national health care market." The administration filed a written submission in the high court's biggest case this term, with the potential to affect President Barack Obama's bid for re-election.\par \par \uc2 Santorum: Trim Social Security now even if painful\par \par \uc2 KEENE, N.H. (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum called Friday for immediate cuts to Social Security benefits, risking the wrath of older voters and countless others who balk at changes to the entitlement program. "We can't wait 10 years," even though "everybody wants to," Santorum told a crowd while campaigning in New Hampshire and looking to set himself apart from his Republican rivals four days before the New Hampshire primary.\par \par \uc2 IRS estimate: 17 percent of taxes owed went unpaid\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) -- People and businesses underpaid their taxes by an estimated 17 percent in the most recent year studied, failing to send the government a massive $450 billion that it was owed, according to an Internal Revenue Service report released Friday. The study covered 2006, the most recent data the IRS said was available. The amount of underpaid taxes far exceeded the size of the entire federal budget deficit at the time.\par \par \uc2 US redefines rape; adds men, others as victims\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Obama administration on Friday expanded the FBI's more than eight-decade-old definition of rape to count men as victims for the first time and to drop the requirement that victims must have physically resisted their attackers. The new definition will increase the number of people counted as rape victims in FBI statistics, but it will not change federal or state laws or alter charges or prosecutions. It's an important shift because lawmakers and policymakers use crime statistics to allocate money and other resources for prevention and victim assistance.\par \par \uc2 US Navy rescues Iranian fishing boat from pirates\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) -- The political tensions between the U.S. and Iran over transit in and around the Persian Gulf gave way Friday to photos of rescued Iranian fisherman happily wearing American Navy ball caps. The fishermen were rescued by a U.S. Navy destroyer Thursday, more than 40 days after their boat was commandeered by suspected Somali pirates in the northern Arabian Sea. The rescue came just days after Tehran warned the U.S. to keep its warships out of the Persian Gulf -- an irony not lost on U.S. officials who trumpeted the news on Friday.\par \par \uc2 Mother: Texas teen deported to Colombia back in US\par \par \uc2 DALLAS (AP) -- A 15-year-old Texas girl who was deported in May to South America after claiming to be an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  was back in the United States and will be in Dallas on Friday evening, her mother said. Johnisa Turner told the Associated Press that her daughter, Jakadrien Lorece Turner, was on a flight from Atlanta. She had said earlier that she planned to meet her daughter when she arrives in the city and that she has "a gazillion questions" for Jakadrien.\par \par \uc2 Joran van der Sloot hints he'll plead guilty\par \par \uc2 LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Joran van der Sloot appears ready to accept responsibility for the killing of a Peruvian woman five years to the day after the disappearance in Aruba of U.S. teen Natalee Holloway, for which he remains the prime suspect. The Dutch citizen sought and received more time to decide how to plead as his trial opened Friday in the May 30, 2010, murder of 21-year-old Stephany Flores, whom he met at a Lima casino.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120106e8160001n\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.  \par \par \uc2 SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) - A Republican state legislator who is an outspoken advocate for gun rights was cited Wednesday for trying to bring a loaded handgun onto a flight.\par \par \uc2 California Assemblyman Tim Donnelly was detained after a Colt .45 with four rounds was discovered inside his carry-on bag as he passed through a screening machine at Ontario International Airport, said Transportation Security Administration spokesman Nico Melendez.\par \par \uc2 Another magazine with five rounds was in Donnelly's carry-on bag at the airport, which is 35 miles east of Los Angeles, Melendez said.\par \par \uc2 Donnelly, a self-proclaimed tea party Republican who lives in the Southern California mountain community of Twin Peaks, said he inadvertently left the gun in his briefcase.\par \par \uc2 He said he had it close by because of death threats he has received since he began spearheading a petition drive for a referendum to overturn a recent state law that allows \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  college students to apply for public financial aid.\par \par \uc2 He told reporters at the state Capitol that he placed the gun in the briefcase to hide it from his wife.\par \par \uc2 "I didn't want her to see that I had my firearm out because we have received death threats with what I've been working on," he said. "So I do tend to always be armed. The issue is strictly one that I completely forgot, coming back to work this morning, that it was in that briefcase."\par \par \uc2 Donnelly does not have a permit from the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department to carry a concealed weapon, department spokeswoman Jodi Miller said. That is the law enforcement agency that has jurisdiction over the area in which Donnelly lives.\par \par \uc2 Donnelly did not respond earlier when reporters asked if he had a concealed weapons permit, and his office did not immediately return a phone message later Wednesday seeking comment on that particular issue.\par \par \uc2 Any charges for failing to have such a permit would have to come from the agency involved in the original incident, Miller said. Ontario Airport Police Sgt. Belinda Nettles said in an email that "to my knowledge the possession of a loaded firearm is the only charge."\par \par \uc2 State lawmakers do not have any special exemption that would allow them to carry concealed weapons without a permit, said John Vigna, a spokesman for the Assembly Speaker's office.\par \par \uc2 Donnelly, 45, represents a largely working-class district east of Los Angeles in a region referred to as the Inland Empire. Before he was elected to the state Assembly in 2010, Donnelly was best known as founder of the Minuteman Civil Defense Corps of California, a group that patrolled the U.S.-Mexico border in search of people attempting to enter the U.S illegally.\par \par \uc2 Lawmakers who report death threats can obtain additional security, but Donnelly had not reported any to Assembly officials, said Robin Swanson, a spokeswoman for Assembly Speaker John Perez, D-Los Angeles.\par \par \uc2 "If there are perceived threats against a member, Assembly sergeants or California Highway Patrol will accompany them to public events on an as-needed basis. A significant number (of assembly members) have needed this protection and used it," Swanson said.\par \par \uc2 Melendez said TSA officials referred the incident to airport police, who cited Donnelly under state law for possession of an unloaded firearm and released him from custody.\par \par \uc2 Nettles, of the Ontario Airport Police, said the officer who cited Donnelly made a mistake and that the citation will be corrected to reflect that the firearm was loaded. That crime is a misdemeanor with a possible penalty of up to a year in jail and $1,000 fine. Nettles said both the gun and the extra magazine were seized.\par \par \uc2 The legislator said in a statement released by his office that he boarded the next \uc2 Southwest Airlines\uc2  flight without incident.\par \par \uc2 Federal prosecutors also could opt to pursue charges against Donnelly, Melendez said. Federal regulations allow passengers to carry guns in their checked luggage under certain conditions. About 1,200 people each year are cited for having a firearm in their carry-on luggage, according to the TSA.\par \par \uc2 "You can take a weapon on a trip with you as checked luggage, as long as it's unloaded and declared to the airline and in a sealed carrying case," Melendez said.\par \par \uc2 Donnelly last year opposed AB144, which made it illegal to carry an exposed and unloaded handgun in a public place in California as of Jan. 1.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120105e8150001g\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) - A Republican state legislator who is an outspoken advocate for gun rights was cited Wednesday for trying to bring a loaded handgun onto a flight.\par \par \uc2 California Assemblyman Tim Donnelly was detained after a Colt .45 with four rounds was discovered inside his carry-on bag as he passed through a screening machine at Ontario International Airport, said Transportation Security Administration spokesman Nico Melendez.\par \par \uc2 Another magazine with five rounds was in Donnelly's carry-on bag at the airport 35 miles east of Los Angeles, Melendez said.\par \par \uc2 Donnelly, a self-proclaimed tea party Republican who lives in the Southern California mountain community of Twin Peaks, said he inadvertently left the gun in his briefcase.\par \par \uc2 He said he had it close by because of death threats he has received from a referendum drive he is spearheading to overturn a recent state law that allows \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  college students to apply for public financial aid. He told reporters at the state Capitol he placed it in the briefcase because he didn't want his wife to see that he had the firearm out.\par \par \uc2 "So I do tend to always be armed. The issue is strictly one that I completely forgot, coming back to work this morning, that it was in that briefcase," he said.\par \par \uc2 Donnelly did not respond when reporters asked if he had a concealed weapons permit.\par \par \uc2 Donnelly, 45, represents a largely working class district east of Los Angeles in a region referred to as the Inland Empire. Before he was elected to the state Assembly in 2010, Donnelly was best known as founder of the Minuteman Civil Defense Corps of California, a group that patrolled the U.S.-Mexico border in search of people attempting to enter the United States illegally.\par \par \uc2 Lawmakers who report death threats can obtain additional security, said Robin Swanson, a spokeswoman for Assembly Speaker John Perez, D-Los Angeles. Officials were checking to see whether Donnelly had reported such concerns, she said.\par \par \uc2 "If there are perceived threats against a member, Assembly sergeants or California Highway Patrol will accompany them to public events on an as-needed basis. A significant number (of assembly members) have needed this protection and used it," she said.\par \par \uc2 Melendez said TSA officials referred the incident to airport police, who cited Donnelly under state law for possession of an unloaded firearm and released him from custody.\par \par \uc2 Ontario Airport Police Sgt. Belinda Nettles said the officer who cited Donnelly made a mistake and that the citation will be corrected to reflect that the firearm was loaded. That crime is a misdemeanor with a possible penalty of up to a year in jail and $1,000 fine. Nettles said both the gun and extra magazine were seized.\par \par \uc2 The legislator said in a statement released by his office that he boarded the next \uc2 Southwest Airlines\uc2  flight without incident.\par \par \uc2 Federal prosecutors could also opt to pursue charges against Donnelly, Melendez said. Federal regulations allow passengers to carry guns in their checked luggage under certain conditions. About 1,200 people each year are cited for having a firearm in their carry-on luggage, according to the TSA.\par \par \uc2 "You can take a weapon on a trip with you as checked luggage, as long as it's unloaded and declared to the airline and in a sealed carrying case," Melendez said.\par \par \uc2 Donnelly last year opposed AB144, which made it illegal to carry an exposed and unloaded handgun in a public place in California as of Jan. 1.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120104e814001o2\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

That passenger, another suspected MS-13 member, has not been found.\par \par \uc2 Jury selection is expected to begin Tuesday and take a few weeks. If convicted, Ramos could face life in prison without parole.\par \par \uc2 The shootings sparked public outrage over San Francisco's sanctuary city policy for illegal immigrants. Under a loophole, juveniles charged with felonies were not turned over for deportation, which allowed Ramos to stay in the U.S. despite his criminal record.\par \par \uc2 A state appeals court ruled last year that San Francisco was not legally liable for the deaths because of its sanctuary policy.\par \par \uc2 Bologna's widow and daughter argued that the city was responsible for the shootings because it failed to turn Ramos over to federal immigration authorities after his prior brushes with the law.\par \par \uc2 Ramos was previously arrested for assault in October 2003 and attempted purse-snatching in 2004 and was sent to juvenile shelters. Court documents don't reveal if police or juvenile courts knew that Ramos had entered the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 Under the juvenile authorities' interpretation of the sanctuary policy, they would not have turned him over to immigration authorities.\par \par \uc2 The murders led to a change in the policy. In July 2008, then-Mayor Gavin Newsom ordered city employees to report suspected underage illegal immigrants to the federal government after a felony arrest.\par \par \uc2 City supervisors then passed an ordinance that requires a youth to be found guilty before being reported, but the mayor refused to implement it, saying it violates federal law.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120102e812001vs\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

Under a loophole, juveniles charged with felonies were not turned over for deportation, which allowed Ramos to stay in the U.S. despite his criminal record.\par \par \uc2 A state appeals court ruled last year that San Francisco was not legally liable for the deaths because of its sanctuary policy.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120102e812001vq\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) - South Carolina lawsuit awards face new limits and employers will be required to check a federal database to see if the people they hire are in the country legally under laws scheduled to go into effect Monday.\par \par \uc2 The limits on lawsuit punitive damage awards only affects new cases and may not show up for months in courtrooms. South Carolina will limit punitive damage awards in lawsuits filed after Jan. 1. In a typical case, punitive damages will be limited to $500,000 or three times the actual damages, whichever is greater.\par \par \uc2 But if the defendant's conduct would bring a felony conviction or was motivated by unreasonable financial gain, the court could raise the maximum award to $2 million, or four times actual damages that include things like lost wages and hospital bills, if that amount is larger. And there is no cap when the defendant intended to cause harm, found guilty of a felony related to the damage or was under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\par \par \uc2 The South Carolina Civil Justice Coalition had pushed the legislation and said it would help make the state more attractive to businesses. "It will add to the stability of anticipated costs for companies," said Joe Jones, the coalition's administrator. "How do you put a value on that."\par \par \uc2 Otis Rawl, chief executive officer of the South Carolina Chamber of Commerce, said the limits are needed. "It protects businesses from frivolous lawsuits," Rawl said. "And it give the state another tool in its toolbox."\par \par \uc2 South Carolina's illegal immigration law is modeled after Arizona's and would be one of the nation's toughest. It requires that police check immigration status at traffic stops and other places. The stops must not be made based on the suspicion that someone is in the U.S. illegally. Meanwhile, the law sets up a new illegal immigration law enforcement unit in the state Department of Public Safety.\par \par \uc2 The law requires employers to check a federal database to see if the people they hire are in the country legally. It makes it a crime to employ illegal immigrants. And it makes it a crime to harbor an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  or to make or hold fake identification. Illegal immigrants would face felony charges by allowing themselves to be transported inside the state.\par \par \uc2 The law is facing legal challenges. The Justice Department, American Civil Liberties Union and several Latin American and Caribbean nations say it is unconstitutional and will promote discrimination.\par \par \uc2 U.S. District Judge Richard Gergel has put parts of the law on hold: harboring illegal immigrants, immigration status checks and a requirement that people carry immigrant registration documents.\par \par \uc2 Gergel also turned down a request by state Deputy Attorney General Emory Smith to let all of the law take effect while the U.S. Supreme Court decides the fate of Arizona's law.\par \par \uc2 He is letting other portions of the law go into effect on Monday. That includes a requirement that businesses check new hires' legal status through a federal online system. Businesses that knowingly violate the law could have their operating licenses revoked\par \par \uc2 Rawl said the immigration law presents a mixed bag of concerns, including from some that agricultural crops won't be harvested.\par \par \uc2 But at the same time, there are plenty of businesses that felt an ample supply of illegal immigrants made it easy for unscrupulous businesses to compete unfairly because they didn't follow wage laws or requirements to buy workers' compensation insurance. "What we need to do is create jobs for our citizens and the people who are here legally," Rawl said.\par \par \uc2 Other new laws affect drivers and people wanting to register cars or get titles for their vehicles will have to show identification.\par \par \uc2 Sen. Larry Martin, a Pickens Republican, co-sponsored the bill. He said it will help people who live out of state and have second homes here South Carolina titles for vehicles that they leave at those second homes. That lets them buy South Carolina insurance policies on those vehicles.\par \par \uc2 The state also is changing the rules for insurance discounts people get after passing driver training courses that previously were only available to people 55 and older. Beginning Jan. 1, people 25 or older can enroll in AARP driver safety classes that last six hours instead of eight. Insurance companies are required to give discounts for drivers who successfully complete the class. The law says people can four-hour classes every four years to renew the credit.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120101e811001yc\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) - Laws that promote the historical contributions of gays and lesbians and help \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  college students gain financial aid will take effect with the new year in California, even as opponents seek to overturn the legislation at the ballot box.\par \par \uc2 They are among hundreds of new laws aimed at issues as diverse as protecting sharks, farm workers and teenagers. Other measures prohibit people from carrying unloaded handguns in public and let children as young as 12 get vaccinated against the leading cause of cervical cancer without their parents' consent.\par \par \uc2 On Jan. 1, California becomes the first state to require public schools to teach the contributions of gays and lesbians. The law adds people with disabilities to the list of social and ethnic groups whose "roles and contributions" must be included in California and U.S. history lessons. It bans instructional materials judged to reflect adversely on gays or particular religions.\par \par \uc2 "We're talking about teaching historical facts at a grade-appropriate level. That's all it is," said Equality California spokeswoman Rebekah Orr, who represents California's largest gay-rights group.\par \par \uc2 Opponents are not giving up on overturning SB48, despite failing in October to gather enough signatures to force a referendum to repeal the law.\par \par \uc2 They have filed five potential ballot initiatives that would repeal the requirement outright or let parents pull their children from classes when gay and lesbian contributions are being taught. The opponents have until spring to gather enough signatures to put the referendums before voters in November.\par \par \uc2 "That law undermines the integrity of objective history instruction for students, and even more importantly undermines the rights of parents in deciding what is appropriate for their child regarding controversial moral and lifestyle issues," argued Brad Dacus, a spokesman for the Pacific Justice Institute, which is helping lead one of the repeal efforts.\par \par \uc2 State Sen. Mark Leno said his bill is even more important in light of recent publicity about lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender students being bullied, which has been blamed for some suicides of homosexual students.\par \par \uc2 "We are currently censuring the history and role and contribution of LGBT-Americans," said Leno, D-San Francisco. "It's no different than when the idea of black history or women's history was first proposed -- radical concepts at the time."\par \par \uc2 Equally contentious is the California Dream Act, which is taking effect in two steps.\par \par \uc2 AB130 becomes law Jan. 1 and will let students who entered the country illegally receive private financial aid at California's public colleges. Opponents are challenging AB131, the second portion that allows illegal immigrants to apply for state-funded scholarships and financial aid at state universities. That provision takes effect Jan. 1, 2013.\par \par \uc2 Dream Act supporters, including Gov. Jerry Brown and the bills' author, Democratic Assemblyman Gil Cedillo of Los Angeles, say the laws show that California remains progressive while other states, including Arizona and Alabama, enacted punitive measures.\par \par \uc2 "A lot of us have grown up here. This is the only place that we know. It's home," said Irvis Orozco, 24, a senior studying international relations at the University of California, Davis. "We just want to contribute to the country by getting our education."\par \par \uc2 Orozco was brought to the country as an infant when his parents sneaked into the Central Valley from Mexico. At age 13, he joined them in the tomato fields surrounding their home in Woodland, 20 miles northeast of the state capital. He was still picking tomatoes in his second year in college to pay his way because he was not eligible to receive financial aid.\par \par \uc2 The new law will make scholarships available only if money remains available after legal residents have applied.\par \par \uc2 Orozco and other proponents say immigrants have paid for the aid with their taxes but have not had the benefits. He acknowledged he will have trouble getting a job because he is in the country illegally but said he hopes Congress will create a path to citizenship for students like himself.\par \par \uc2 Republican Assemblyman Tim Donnelly, who once led California's largest Minuteman group opposing illegal immigration, is leading the effort to rescind AB131. That requires collecting 505,000 signatures by Jan. 6 to put a referendum on the November ballot. He said the law creates "a massive new entitlement program."\par \par \uc2 "This is not about the poor immigrant kids who came here through no fault of their own," Donnelly of Hesperia, said of his repeal effort. "It's going to be fascinating if this goes on the ballot, because we haven't had something similar since Prop. 187."\par \par \uc2 Voters approved Proposition 187 in 1994, prohibiting the state from providing public services such as education and health care to illegal immigrants. Most of the initiative was later declared unconstitutional.\par \par \uc2 Among other laws taking effect Jan. 1:\par \par \uc2 -- California will be the first state to make it illegal for anyone younger than 18 to use tanning beds, under SB746 by Sen. Ted Lieu, D-Torrance. Before the law, using tanning beds was illegal for those 14 and under, but those ages 15-17 could use them with their parents' permission.\par \par \uc2 -- Agriculture employers found to have violated union election rules will face tougher sanctions under a law authored by Senate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg, D-Sacramento. His SB126 lets the state Agricultural Labor Relations Board automatically certify farmworker unions as a penalty.\par \par \uc2 -- California is joining Hawaii, Washington, Oregon and Guam in banning the sale, trade and possession of shark fins. Gov. Jerry Brown said he signed AB376, by Assemblyman Paul Fong, D-Cupertino, to protect the world's dwindling shark population, over objections that the fins are used in a soup considered a delicacy in some Asian cultures.\par \par \uc2 -- It becomes illegal to carry an exposed and unloaded handgun in a public place under AB144. Violators could face up to a year in prison or a $1,000 fine. The bill by Assemblyman Anthony Portantino, D-La Canada Flintridge, prompted some gun-rights activists to carry their unloaded weapons in public to protest the legislation. A National Rifle Association attorney predicted some owners may now carry their rifles in public to make a political statement.\par \par \uc2 -- Children as young as 12 can be vaccinated without their parents' consent against human papillomavirus, known as HPV, the leading cause of cervical cancer. AB499 by Assemblywoman Toni Atkins, D-San Diego, pitted public health officials against parental-rights advocates.\par \par \uc2 -- California becomes the first state to require businesses to report the risks of human trafficking and inhumane working conditions during the manufacture of the goods they supply. SB657, by Senate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg, D-Sacramento, applies to companies with $100 million in worldwide sales.\par \par \uc2 -- Caffeinated beer products will be banned after several high-profile incidents in which college students drank too much of the beverages and had to be hospitalized. The drinks typically have a high alcohol content and come in large containers. California becomes the seventh state to outlaw the drinks under SB39 by Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Los Angeles, although most manufacturers already changed their formulas to exclude caffeine.\par \par \uc2 -- California becomes the first state to prohibit selling over-the-counter cold and cough medications containing dextromethorphan (DXM) to minors. SB514 by Sen. Joe Simitian, D-Palo Alto, requires clerks to check identification before selling the medications, which in high doses can cause hallucinations, seizures, loss of motor control, "out of body" sensations and liver failure.\par \par \uc2 -- Children must be buckled into booster seats in vehicles until they turn 8 or grow to a height of 4-foot-9, under SB929 by Sen. Noreen Evans, D-Santa Rosa. That's two more years than under the previous law, which required the restraints until children turned 6 or reached 60 pounds.\par \par \uc2 -- Drivers with older, unpaid traffic tickets will have a six-month window in which they will owe just half the amount of the original fine. Under SB857, a budget bill approved by lawmakers, those who have not paid fines that were due by Jan. 1, 2009, will be allowed to pay just half but must do so before June 30.\par \par \uc2 -- Businesses that willfully misclassify employees as independent contractors could face penalties of $5,000 to $25,000, under SB459 by Sen. Ellen Corbett, D-San Leandro. Labor unions that sought the bill say some employers misclassify workers who thus lose minimum wage and overtime protections, workers' compensation coverage, family leave and unemployment insurance. Business groups opposed the bill, saying the line between employee and contractor is ambiguous. They say the law could prevent small businesses from hiring outside consultants without employing them.\par \par \uc2 -- Employers will be prohibited from using consumer credit reports when considering applicants for most jobs under AB22, by Assemblyman Tony Mendoza, D-Artesia. Credit checks still will be allowed for hiring managers, law enforcement, financial jobs and other positions in which the person would handle valuable items or information.\par \par \uc2 -- Two laws are intended to improve the state's business climate. SB617, by Sens. Ron Calderon, D-Monterey Park, and Fran Pavley, D-Agoura Hills, requires state agencies to evaluate new regulations if they have an estimated $50 million economic impact or more on businesses. AB29 by Assembly Speaker John Perez, D-Los Angeles, creates the Governor's Office of Business and Economic Development.\par \par \uc2 -- Local police will no longer be able to impound vehicles at sobriety checkpoints if the driver's only offense is not being licensed. The author of AB353, Assemblyman Gil Cedillo, D-Los Angeles, said some cities have used checkpoints in poor areas to target unlicensed drivers.\par \par \uc2 -- Developers of projects costing $100 million or more can speed up judicial review of environmental challenges. AB900, by Assemblywoman Joan Buchanan, D-Alamo, was a companion bill to SB292 by Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Los Angeles, which is designed to aid construction of a downtown Los Angeles professional football stadium.\par \par \uc2 -- Insurers must provide coverage for maternity care under a pair of bills. Previously, more than 200,000 women of childbearing age had health insurance plans that do not cover maternity care. SB222 by state Sen. Noreen Evans, D-Santa Rosa, requires health insurance companies to provide maternity coverage through individual insurance plans. AB210 by Assemblyman Roger Hernandez, D-Baldwin Park, covers group health insurance policies.\par \par \uc2 -- Jurors will be specifically prohibited from texting, tweeting and using smart phones to discuss or research cases under AB141. The bill by Assemblyman Felipe Fuentes, D-Sylmar, adds to existing instructions warning jurors that they must consider only facts presented to them in court without doing their own research or communicating outside the jury room.\par \par \uc2 -- It will be illegal to disrupt students as they enter or leave school under AB123. Assemblyman Tony Mendoza, D-Artesia, sought the bill after an appeals court ruled that an anti-abortion group could display large photographs of aborted fetuses during a 2003 demonstration outside a California middle school.\par \par \uc2 -- Testimony by a jailhouse informant will no longer be enough to convict a suspect under SB687. The bill by Sen. Mark Leno, D-San Francisco, requires that prosecutors corroborate claims that a cellmate confessed to a crime.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020111230e7cu001na\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) - It was a year of extremes for New Mexico, with dramatic weather dominating the headlines from start to finish in 2011.\par \par \uc2 The year began with a deep freeze that plunged the state into a subzero tundra for several days, leaving an estimated 32,000 homes and businesses without natural gas. The double whammy of record cold temperatures and the natural gas shortage cost insurance companies more than $55 million in claims.\par \par \uc2 Then came the drought, which turned New Mexico into a tinderbox, forcing the closure of much of the state's outdoor recreation centers as wildfires raged.\par \par \uc2 The biggest story of the year was no doubt the massive Las Conchas fire, which burned more than 244 square miles to become the largest in New Mexico history.\par \par \uc2 For nearly a week, the fire raged on the outskirts of Los Alamos, forcing the evacuation of the town as well as one of the nation's premier nuclear facilities, Los Alamos National Laboratory. At one point, the flames lapped at lab property, raising safety concerns about the thousands of barrels of radioactive waste stored there temporarily.\par \par \uc2 It took almost six weeks for hundreds of firefighters to contain the blaze. More than five dozen homes were destroyed, and a significant portion of Bandelier National Monument was forever changed, along with lands held sacred by nearby Santa Clara Pueblo.\par \par \uc2 But even as the fire died out, the rest of the state still had to deal with one of the worst droughts to hit in decades.\par \par \uc2 Farmers along the lower Pecos and Rio Grande had to pump groundwater to irrigate their crops, and ranchers had to sell off cattle because their pastures never greened up. Municipal utilities around the state began implementing watering restrictions early and, in Albuquerque, officials extended their drought advisory through March 2012.\par \par \uc2 The sting of the drought began to ease in late November with the first of a series of storms that brought snow and rain. Northeastern New Mexico was hit hardest with a blizzard that left dozens of travelers stranded, including a Texas family that had to be rescued after their vehicle was buried under 4 feet of snow and ice.\par \par \uc2 Besides setting records with the weather, New Mexico made political history when it inaugurated its first female Hispanic governor.\par \par \uc2 Republican Gov. Susana Martinez won over voters with campaign promises such as the repeal of a law allowing illegal immigrants to get drivers licenses, but the Democrat-controlled Legislature killed those key measures. She managed to hold her own on what she considered important issues: curbing government waste and excess spending.\par \par \uc2 Martinez's push to pass the driver's license bill during regular and special legislative sessions made her a target of immigrant rights groups, which questioned the immigration status of her paternal grandfather, who came from Mexico. She made national headlines after telling Univision her grandfather was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . But research revealed the grandfather, who she said she never knew, came to the country legally.\par \par \uc2 Her administration also found itself tied up in court as environment groups fought over what they considered rollbacks of air and water quality protections that passed at the end of Democratic Gov. Bill Richardson's tenure. The fight over whether New Mexico will regulate greenhouse gas emissions has yet to be settled.\par \par \uc2 And things wouldn't be right in New Mexico without a political scandal. Richardson remained in the headlines, first with allegations that state District Judge Michael Murphy told a judicial candidate she had to make contributions to a Democratic activist close to Richardson if she wanted to be considered for a judgeship.\par \par \uc2 A report accompanying Murphy's indictment on bribery charges in May claimed those contributions were funneled to Richardson, who as governor had the final say on all judicial appointments. Richardson has called the accusations "outrageous and defamatory." Murphy is set to go to trial next year.\par \par \uc2 In December, the Albuquerque Journal broke the news that a grand jury was investigating whether money from campaign supporters was used to settle a threatened lawsuit against Richardson in 2007 by a woman who formerly worked in state government. Richardson and federal prosecutors have declined to comment about the probe.\par \par \uc2 In another judicial scandal, Albuquerque's chief criminal judge, Pat Murdoch, resigned in disgrace after he was accused of raping a prostitute. And one of the state's most respected political professors and a former president of the University of New Mexico, F. Chris Garcia, was suspended after he was arrested on charges he recruited women for an elaborate online prostitution ring run by another college professor, David Flory of Farleigh Dickinson University, who has homes in New York and Santa Fe.\par \par \uc2 Although all three were arrested and charged, none have been indicted yet.\par \par \uc2 Among elected officials, former Public Regulatory Commissioner Jerome Block was forced from office and pleaded guilty to charges including fraudulent use of a state-issued credit card and other felonies for violating campaigning finance laws.\par \par \uc2 Under a plea deal, Block was expected to avoid prison time if he completed a court-supervised treatment program for an addiction to prescription painkillers. He has been jailed three times for violating the agreement and was kicked out of the drug program.\par \par \uc2 Albuquerque police came under fire for a rash of shootings and other questionable actions by officers, including inflammatory social media postings. An officer involved in a fatal shooting had described his occupation on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  as "human waste disposal."\par \par \uc2 Twenty suspects were shot by officers in almost as many months, 14 fatally. In June, then-Public Safety Director Darren White admitted the department was plagued by misconduct. The shootings declined shortly after the department began implementing recommendations from a think tank the city hired, but the Justice Department is reviewing whether to launch a formal investigation.\par \par \uc2 Back at Los Alamos National Laboratory, a renewed focus on cleanup and progress followed the fire. After nearly three decades, the lab completed a public review process and issued the necessary orders to finalize designs and begin construction on a controversial new plutonium lab, the $6 billion Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Replacement Nuclear Facility.\par \par \uc2 But Congress cut funding for the project in December and prohibited officials from starting construction this year. Watchdogs contended it's an unnecessary attempt to expand the lab's nuclear weapons mission and questioned whether it would be safe given new seismic assessments showing an increased potential for a strong earthquake in the area.\par \par \uc2 The state's other scientific endeavor, however, moved one step closer to solidifying New Mexico's place in the burgeoning space tourism race. Martinez and British billionaire Richard Branson, founder of the Virgin Galactic spaceline, celebrated the dedication of Spaceport America's terminal hangar facility in southern New Mexico in October.\par \par \uc2 Branson's prediction that day: Test flights by the end of 2012.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020111229e7ct001zd\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - A lawsuit filed in Nashville claims a new policy that instructs Tennessee jailers on how to investigate the immigration status of detainees is illegal because it was crafted in secret.\par \par \uc2 The lawsuit says the Peace Officers Standards and Training Commission deliberated by email and in meetings where public notice was not properly given, including an Oct. 15, 2010, meeting where the policy was adopted, according to The Tennessean ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://tnne.ws/uk0XQG"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://tnne.ws/uk0XQG}}}\uc2 ).\par \par \uc2 Plaintiff William Geissler seeks an injunction to immediately stop enforcement of the policy, and a hearing on that request is scheduled for Wednesday in Davidson County Chancery Court.\par \par \uc2 In its response to the lawsuit, the Attorney General's Office argues, "Plaintiff makes no allegation that a temporary injunction, now over one year after POST promulgated its written procedure, is immediately necessary and that waiting for a final judgment would be ineffective."\par \par \uc2 The response does not address whether the commission violated the state's open meetings law.\par \par \uc2 The POST Commission was required to draw up the policy by a new state law that took effect this year requiring jailers for cities and counties across the state to contact U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement when they detain a suspected \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . The law gave the commission the responsibility of instructing jailers on how to carry out the law.\par \par \uc2 The policy the commission adopted requires jailers to ask detainees whether they are citizens and whether they were born in the United States.\par \par \uc2 "The response to those questions will trigger an inquiry to (U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement) as to whether the individual needs to be held or not," according to the minutes from the commission's meeting Oct. 15, 2010.\par \par \uc2 Frank Gibson, public policy director for the Tennessee Press Association, said the POST Commission is subject to the state's open meetings laws. But even if Geissler and attorney Elliott Ozment win the case, it is likely the policy would only be invalidated temporarily. There is nothing to stop the POST Commission from re-establishing the same policy, this time following the state's open meeting laws.\par \par \uc2 Ultimately, Ozment said, he would like to see the entire law declared unconstitutional by the courts. But he hopes an injunction invalidating the procedures will stop enforcement temporarily while he prepares a challenge in federal court.\par \par \uc2 Critics say the law requires local jailers to
