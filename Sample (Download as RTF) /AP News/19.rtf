The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) - President Barack Obama is enlisting activists and labor leaders in a push for comprehensive immigration legislation that will showcase Republican opposition and include a speech by the president.\par \par \uc2 The strategy was discussed during a meeting Monday by a range of prominent labor leaders and activist groups. Participants said Obama reiterated his support for immigration legislation but noted the political realities that have stalled it in Congress.\par \par \uc2 Latino leaders say they will work in coming months to pressure Republicans to give way and support an immigration bill -- and make opponents pay at the ballot box if they don't.\par \par \uc2 "We're going to make absolutely crystal clear who's at fault here," said Eliseo Medina, a leader of the Service Employees International Union.\par \par \uc2 Prospects for passage of comprehensive immigration legislation look bleak this election year, and even many Democrats are wary of wading into the hot-button issue. But Obama, who pledged as a candidate to make immigration reform a top priority during his first year in office, faces pressure from the Hispanic community to act -- or at least to try.\par \par \uc2 That's only intensified in the wake of Arizona's passage of a controversial law that requires police officers to question a person's immigration status if there's reason to suspect the person is in the country illegally. Obama has spoken out against the law and asked the Justice Department to examine its legality. Activists anticipate that the Justice Department will sue to overturn the law, but in Monday's meeting Obama said that decision would be left up to the department, and he didn't give a timeline, participants said.\par \par \uc2 The White House said Obama would deliver a speech soon on "the importance of passing comprehensive immigration reform" but didn't give more details.\par \par \uc2 Given the difficulties of achieving a comprehensive bill, participants said there was also discussion of attempting to pass smaller pieces of legislation -- such as a bill focused on agricultural workers, or one that would help \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  youths attend college.\par \par \uc2 Obama is to meet Tuesday with Hispanic members of Congress.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100628e66s002ok\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ATLANTA (AP) - With rhetoric about immigration intensifying nationwide, Georgia's Republican candidates for governor are taking every chance they get to reiterate their tough stances on illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 At debates and forums, on their websites and in television advertisements, the four top contenders in the seven-person GOP primary say they'd support a tough immigration law like the one that recently passed in Arizona. And they're calling on state college administrators to make sure no illegal immigrants attend state schools.\par \par \uc2 "The competing Republican gubernatorial candidates are simply trying to show that they are very much committed to tougher immigration policy," said University of Georgia political science professor Charles Bullock. "There's probably not a whole lot of difference between what they would do but, you know, it plays well."\par \par \uc2 With a comprehensive immigration reform plan seeming unlikely to make it onto the congressional agenda this year, immigration might have lost footing this election year to pressing issues like health care and the economy. But the passage of a strict new law in Arizona in April sparked months of heated debate.\par \par \uc2 "The reality is illegal immigration is a big problem nationwide, and it's a big problem in Georgia," said Stephen Puetz, campaign manager for Insurance Commissioner John Oxendine, the GOP money leader. "Our state needs to do more if the federal government isn't going to enforce their laws."\par \par \uc2 The Arizona law, which goes into effect next month, requires police investigating another incident or crime to ask people about their immigration status if there's a "reasonable suspicion" they're in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 It has been widely decried by civil liberties and immigrant rights activists, and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton recently said the federal government planned to sue over the issue.\par \par \uc2 The four leading contenders for the Republican nomination for governor in Georgia have all said they would like to see a law here that mirrors the Arizona law.\par \par \uc2 "Nathan would put into law legislation similar to what passed in Arizona," said Brian Robinson, a spokesman for former congressman Nathan Deal. "Immigration reform will be part of his mandate in his first session at the Legislature as governor."\par \par \uc2 The high-profile case of an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  student at Kennesaw State University who was arrested in the spring after being stopped for a minor traffic violation and was nearly deported before the federal government deferred action on her case for a year has also fueled the immigration debate in Georgia.\par \par \uc2 "Karen thinks we should check the legal status of students, and that those who are not here legally should be removed from school and should, frankly, be sent back to their country of origin," said Dan McLagan, a spokesman for former Secretary of State Karen Handel.\par \par \uc2 Handel and the other three leading Republican candidates have all called on the Board of Regents, which oversees the state's public universities and colleges, to come up with a way to verify that applicants are in the country legally.\par \par \uc2 Former state Sen. Eric Johnson earlier this month unveiled a proposal that would require elementary and secondary schools to collect citizenship data on enrolling students and also would require public hospitals to find out which patients are in the country legally.\par \par \uc2 Deal has publicly sparred with Johnson over that proposal, saying teachers and hospitals shouldn't be dragged into enforcement of immigration laws.\par \par \uc2 Oxendine has said he will work with the state's next attorney general to sue the federal government to recoup prison and other costs incurred by the state for the detention of any \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . His reasoning for that, said Puetz, is that states wouldn't have to bear those costs if the federal government had effectively done its job of keeping illegal immigrants out.\par \par \uc2 In his role as insurance commissioner, a seat he's held since 1994, Oxendine hasn't dealt much with the issue of illegal immigration. The other three leading Republicans all tout their past records as indicators of future toughness.\par \par \uc2 Johnson notes that he was president pro tem in the state Senate when Georgia passed one of the toughest immigration laws in the country.\par \par \uc2 Handel implemented the use of the federal SAVE database to verify the immigration status of applicants for professional licenses when she was secretary of state, McLagan said.\par \par \uc2 Deal's campaign notes he consistently pushed for stricter enforcement of federal immigration laws while he was in Congress.\par \par \uc2 While immigration has been a much-discussed topic for Republicans in the gubernatorial primary, it's barely been a blip on the radar on the Democratic side. But Bullock, the UGA professor, thinks it's a topic the Democratic nominee won't be able to avoid.\par \par \uc2 "I think it will continue on into the general election," he said. "It's going to be an issue that I think we're going to see Republicans using across the nation."\par \par \uc2 That wouldn't be a new tactic. When Gov. Sonny Perdue was running for re-election in 2006, GOP ads depicted him as tough on illegal immigration after he signed a strict immigration bill into law and accused Democratic challenger Mark Taylor of failing to show leadership on the issue.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100627e66r003ee\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

Patrick weighs final budget plan while facing tough re-election campaign\b0\par\par\uc2 By STEVE LeBLANC   \par \uc2 Associated Press Writer\par \uc2 730 \uc2 words\par \uc2 26 June 2010\par 14:00\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2010.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 BOSTON (AP) - For Gov. Deval Patrick, there's good news and bad news in the stripped down budget shipped to his desk by Massachusetts lawmakers.\par \par \uc2 While the budget is rife with cuts, including a 4 percent reduction in state aid to cities and towns, it largely lets him off the hook on a Senate-backed clampdown on illegal immigrants that was part of the budget legislation but was watered down before getting final approval.\par \par \uc2 Patrick could sign or veto the budget before Thursday, the start of the 2011 fiscal year, but said he remained open to working with lawmakers.\par \par \uc2 "I am working with the Legislature now to produce a balanced budget that faces these challenges squarely while protecting education funding, local aid, health care, and job creation," the governor said last week.\par \par \uc2 Patrick and the Legislature are strongly divided on the issue of local aid.\par \par \uc2 Patrick's budget plan, released in January, avoided cuts in state aid partly by drawing more money from the state's rapidly dwindling "rainy day" savings account.\par \par \uc2 The House and Senate opted to leave the rainy day fund intact fearing next year's budget could be even tighter and, instead, approved a $160 million reduction.\par \par \uc2 While Patrick may still be opposed to cutting local aid, it may be harder to avoid because of the failure of Congress so far to approve additional Medicaid money, which both the governor and Legislature had factored into their budget proposals.\par \par \uc2 House and Senate budget negotiators essentially filed two budgets: a $27.9 billion plan that included additional Medicaid money and a $27.6 billion plan that does not.\par \par \uc2 To help close a $687 million Medicaid gap, budget negotiators diverted nearly $200 million from the state's rainy day fund and made additional, targeted cuts. If Congress approves the extra funds, the cuts would be reversed.\par \par \uc2 Geoff Beckwith, executive director of the Massachusetts Municipal Association, said local officials have braced for cuts.\par \par \uc2 "It could have been worse," he said. "There could have been deeper cuts."\par \par \uc2 The Legislature's budget also spares Patrick a politically dicey decision on a Senate-backed budget amendment aimed at cracking down on illegal immigrants getting public benefits.\par \par \uc2 The budget eliminated parts of the amendment that created a 24-hour hot line to report suspected \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  workers and that required the state attorney general to sign an agreement to enforce federal immigration law.\par \par \uc2 If the full amendment had been in the budget, Patrick would have faced the decision whether to sign it and alienate some of his core supporters, or veto it and risk putting off moderate voters just as he's facing a tough re-election campaign.\par \par \uc2 "Governor Patrick has made it clear he supports granting in-state tuition benefits and issuing drivers licenses to illegal immigrants, and we just saved him the trouble of having to veto these reforms," said Senate Republican leader Richard Tisei, who is running for lieutenant governor on a ticket with Republican gubernatorial candidate Charles Baker.\par \par \uc2 Immigrant advocates said that while they were grateful the budget doesn't include the harsher measures, they were concerned about a cut in a program that provides health coverage to more than 30,000 legal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 "It leaves us in exactly the same position we were a year ago, replaying a nightmare for thousands of moderate-income legal residents who will be left without coverage," said Eva Millona, director of the Massachusetts Immigrants and Refugee Advocacy Coalition.\par \par \uc2 House and Senate leaders also spared Patrick the prospect of signing more tax hikes.\par \par \uc2 The final budget rejects any new taxes, including $75 million in Registry of Motor Vehicle fees and other tax and fee hikes Patrick had proposed.\par \par \uc2 "I am proud that the Legislature has produced an efficient budget on time without any new taxes," House Speaker Robert DeLeo, D-Winthrop, said.\par \par \uc2 Baker and independent state Treasurer Timothy Cahill, who also is running for governor, have faulted Patrick for approving tax hikes, including raising the state's sales tax from 5 percent to 6.25 percent and subjecting alcohol sold in stores to the sales tax.\par \par \uc2 Patrick has said that Baker and Cahill have yet to specify where they would make cuts to compensate for the loss of revenue if those tax hikes were eliminated.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100626e66q002gx\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc10}{\*\bkmkend toc10}\b \uc2 Legislators aim to copy US state's immigration law\b0\par\par\uc2 By JOHN MILLER   \par \uc2 Associated Press Writer\par \uc2 1,309 \uc2 words\par \uc2 25 June 2010\par 18:25\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2010.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 BOISE, Idaho (AP) - Arizona's sweeping new immigration law doesn't even take effect until next month, but lawmakers in nearly 20 other states are already clamoring to follow in its footsteps.\par \par \uc2 Gubernatorial candidates in Florida and Minnesota are singing the law's praises, as are some lawmakers in other states far from the Mexico border such as Idaho and Nebraska. But states also are watching legal challenges to the new law, and whether boycotts over it will harm Arizona's economy.\par \par \uc2 The law, set to take effect July 29, requires police to check the immigration status of anyone they think is in the country illegally. Violators face up to six months in jail and $2,500 in fines, in addition to deportation by federal authorities.\par \par \uc2 Lawmakers or candidates in as many as 18 states say they want to push similar measures when their legislative sessions start up again in 2011. Arizona-style legislation may have the best chance of passing in Oklahoma, which in 2007 gave police more power to check the immigration status of people they arrest.\par \par \uc2 Bills similar to the law Arizona's legislature approved in April have already been introduced in Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Minnesota, South Carolina and Michigan, but none will advance this year.\par \par \uc2 Business, agriculture and civil rights groups oppose such legislation, saying legal residents who are Hispanic would be unjustly harassed and that immigration is a federal rather than a state responsibility. Supporters say police will not stop people solely on the basis of skin color and argue that illegal immigrants are draining state coffers by taking jobs, using public services, fueling gang violence and filling prisons.\par \par \uc2 "If the feds won't do it, states are saying, 'We're going to have to do it,'" said Idaho state Sen. Monty Pearce. Pearce's second cousin is the author of the Arizona law, Arizona state Sen. Russell Pearce, who like Monty Pearce is a Republican.\par \par \uc2 The debate is putting pressure on Congress and the Obama administration to act. In 2007, when states like Idaho and Kansas were making English their official languages as part of an immigration-related push, then-President George W. Bush failed to persuade even many Republican allies in the U.S. Senate to agree to combine increased border enforcement with a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 President Barack Obama has called Arizona's law irresponsible, but Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer says it helped prompt him to send 1,200 National Guard members to the U.S.-Mexican border, mostly to her state. She and Arizona Sen. John McCain say that's not enough.\par \par \uc2 McCain, Obama's one-time presidential rival, says the border needs a force approaching the 6,000 soldiers sent by President Bush until 2008.\par \par \uc2 Obama is asking Congress for $600 million in emergency funds for 1,000 more Border Patrol agents, 160 new federal immigration officers and two unmanned aircraft, but immigration is not at the top of his priorities this year. An Associated Press-GfK poll this month found that 85 percent of people now rank immigration as an important issue, and about half disapprove of how Obama has handled it.\par \par \uc2 In Florida, Arizona's law is a campaign issue in the Republican gubernatorial primary, with millionaire Rick Scott trumpeting its merits and Attorney General Bill McCollum saying he backs the law but that it's not needed in his state. Meanwhile, Minnesota gubernatorial candidate Tom Emmer, the presumptive Republican nominee, called Arizona's bill "a wonderful first step."\par \par \uc2 Even lawmakers in states far from the U.S.-Mexico border say illegal immigration is hurting their constituents.\par \par \uc2 In Idaho, Monty Pearce cites one county that paid more than $100,000 for medical services for an indigent \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . Supporters of a citizen initiative in Nevada say they're motivated by the state budget crisis and record unemployment.\par \par \uc2 In South Carolina, state law enforcement officials say Mexican drug gangs are moving north from Atlanta -- a problem expected to intensify given that budget cuts have left fewer resources to go toe-to-toe with armed criminal groups.\par \par \uc2 And in Nebraska, where many Hispanics have found work at meatpacking plants, some blame illegal immigrants for draining community resources. Last week, the town of Fremont approved a ban on hiring or renting property to illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 State Sen. Charlie Janssen of Fremont vows to introduce an Arizona-style bill in 2011 and says foes of illegal immigration must gird themselves for a fight.\par \par \uc2 "They will use words like 'racism' and 'profiling' when we talk about enforcing our laws," said Janssen, a Republican in Nebraska's officially nonpartisan legislature. "But now is when we must stand together."\par \par \uc2 William Gheen, president of the North Carolina-based Americans for Legal Immigration Political Action Committee, said the more states that sign on, the more likely Congress will be to act. Gheen has led a grassroots campaign to get legislatures to take up Arizona's bill and believes the topic could become the litmus test in an election year when people are already slamming Washington.\par \par \uc2 "Any candidate that wants to survive the bloodbath that's approaching this November needs to come out in support" of Arizona's law, Gheen said. He sends regular e-mail messages urging about 30,000 recipients to contact their legislators to support similar bills.\par \par \uc2 Gheen claims that at least 18 states may pass Arizona-style reforms, but the National Conference of State Legislature calls this more a "wish list" than a reflection of likely success. In Pennsylvania, for instance, the issue is being pushed mostly by a single lawmaker.\par \par \uc2 There has been little sign that the other three states that border Mexico will follow Arizona's lead. California, New Mexico and Texas have long-established, politically powerful Hispanic communities, and have seen less illegal immigration than Arizona since the 1990s, when the U.S. government added fences, stadium lights and more agents to the border in California and Texas.\par \par \uc2 Arizona, a state of 6.6 million with an estimated 486,000 illegal immigrants, has been affected by the issue more than other states, said Ann Morse, who heads the National Conference of State Legislature's Immigrant Policy Project.\par \par \uc2 In three years, U.S. Border Patrol agents in Arizona arrested nearly 1 million illegal immigrants, about half of all arrests on U.S. borders. More slipped past, fueling a smuggling industry that has been blamed for a steady rise in kidnappings and immigrant safehouses.\par \par \uc2 Vivek Malhotra, advocacy and policy counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, said she thinks the threat of Arizona-style legislation will continue to be a rallying cry into 2011, but believes many states ultimately won't follow through for fear of repercussions.\par \par \uc2 City councils in Los Angeles, Sacramento, California, and Bloomington, Indiana, are among the governments that have boycotted Arizona, refusing to do business with companies based there. Lawmakers in California are considering a plan for their state to follow suit.\par \par \uc2 "Nobody wants to see their state perceived as unwelcoming," said Malhotra, whose group is suing Arizona over its law.\par \par \uc2 Also lining up against state-by-state legislation are business and agriculture groups. Brent Olmstead, lobbyist for Idaho's $2 billion dairy industry, pledged to work to kill Arizona-style reforms in Idaho in 2011 just as he did to block past bills seeking to punish companies that hire illegal workers.\par \par \uc2 "The issue just gets more convoluted," Olmstead said. "It sends a message that the Latino and Hispanic population isn't wanted."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Contributing to this story were AP writers Mark Scolforo in Harrisburg, Pa.; Tim Talley in Oklahoma City; Nate Jenkins in Lincoln, Nebraska; Seanna Adcox in Columbia, South Carolina; Sandra Chereb in Carson City, Nevada; Bill Kaczor in Tallahassee, Florida; and Martiga Lohn in St. Paul, Minnesota.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100625e66p002rn\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

BECK   \par \uc2 Associated Press Writer\par \uc2 748 \uc2 words\par \uc2 25 June 2010\par 11:13\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2010.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 FREMONT, Neb. (AP) - An immigration measure approved by voters this week in the eastern Nebraska city of Fremont could cost the community millions in litigation while doing little to keep illegal immigrants out.\par \par \uc2 While the ordinance would ban the hiring or renting of housing to illegal immigrants within Fremont, the two local meatpacking plants -- Hormel and Fremont Beef -- that have drawn immigrants workers lie outside city limits.\par \par \uc2 Likewise, many immigrants -- mainly Hispanic -- rent property at various mobile home parks outside the city of 25,000 people, said Kristin Ostrom, who helped organize opposition to the ordinance.\par \par \uc2 "So, you're talking very few people that this law will affect," she said.\par \par \uc2 Kansas City, Kan.-based attorney Kris Kobach, who drafted the Fremont ordinance and several similar ones around the country, said that even if many illegal immigrants work and live outside city limits, the measure still serves to deter illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 "One of the things we have found in other jurisdictions ... where the city is taking some steps to stop illegal immigration -- once the ordinance goes into effect, many illegal aliens will not try to beat the system," Kobach said. "They won't try to get a job in Fremont, or they won't try to get tenancy in Fremont, because they fear -- correctly -- that they might get caught."\par \par \uc2 Under the ordinance, people seeking to rent property within the city limits will have to first apply for a $5 permit at city hall. Those who declare they are U.S. citizens will have their application approved on the spot, without further questions or documents proving legal status. Those who say they are not citizens will also immediately receive a permit, but will have their legal status checked. If that check does not show them to be in the country legally, they will be given 60 days to prove their legal status. If they fail to do so, police will issue a notice that they have 45 days to leave the property.\par \par \uc2 Only new renters -- not current tenants -- are affected by the ordinance, and landlords who knowingly rent to an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  could be subject to a $100 fine.\par \par \uc2 The ordinance also requires employers within the city to use the federal E-Verify database, which is meant to ensure that employees are allowed to work. However, research company Westat evaluated the system for the Homeland Security Department earlier this year and found that the system wrongly clears illegal workers about 54 percent of the time -- mainly because the system can't detect identity fraud.\par \par \uc2 Nowhere does the ordinance call for local police to arrest suspected illegal immigrants believed to be renting or working in Fremont.\par \par \uc2 The American Civil Liberties Union calls the measure unconstitutional and has promised to file a lawsuit to block enforcement of it. City officials have said they expect the cost of implementing and defending the ordinance in court will average $1 million a year.\par \par \uc2 What will the city get for that price tag? Those opposed to the ordinance say not much. They point to estimates by demographers with the Pew Hispanic Center who estimate Fremont's \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  population at 500 or fewer.\par \par \uc2 Kobach said he believes that figure is low.\par \par \uc2 "Our estimate is between 1,000 and 2,000," Kobach said, based on a variety of sources including comparisons to similarly sized cities with meatpacking plants and estimates from those who organized the petition drive to get the ordinance on the ballot.\par \par \uc2 Election officials plan to certify the vote on the ordinance next week, and it would not go into effect until at least 30 days later, after the City Council has approved the certification.\par \par \uc2 Fremont City Hall was inundated with calls Wednesday after Houston radio talk show host Michael Berry asked listeners to call the city to show support for the ordinance.\par \par \uc2 "We got hundreds of calls yesterday," city administrative assistant Sheila Pettit said. "Every 20 seconds, the phone would ring, and every one of them said the same thing: `We support what you're doing.' My neck was killing me by the time I got home."\par \par \uc2 The ordinance may have become a pain in the neck for at least one city official. City Council President Gary Bolton announced his resignation Thursday, saying in a statement that "a number of community issues" in the past year have taken a physical and emotional toll.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100625e66p001ut\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

BECK   \par \uc2 Associated Press Writer\par \uc2 742 \uc2 words\par \uc2 24 June 2010\par 18:47\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2010.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 FREMONT, Neb. (AP) - An immigration measure approved by voters this week in the eastern Nebraska city of Fremont could cost the community millions in litigation while doing little to keep illegal immigrants out.\par \par \uc2 While the ordinance would ban the hiring or renting of housing to illegal immigrants within Fremont, the two local meatpacking plants -- Hormel and Fremont Beef -- that have drawn immigrants workers lie outside city limits.\par \par \uc2 Likewise, many immigrants -- mainly Hispanic -- rent property at various mobile home parks outside the city of 25,000 people, said Kristin Ostrom, who helped organize opposition to the ordinance.\par \par \uc2 "So, you're talking very few people that this law will affect," she said.\par \par \uc2 Kansas City, Kan.-based attorney Kris Kobach, who drafted the Fremont ordinance and several similar ones around the country, said that even if many illegal immigrants work and live outside city limits, the measure still serves to deter illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 "One of the things we have found in other jurisdictions ... where the city is taking some steps to stop illegal immigration -- once the ordinance goes into effect, many illegal aliens will not try to beat the system," Kobach said. "They won't try to get a job in Fremont, or they won't try to get tenancy in Fremont, because they fear -- correctly -- that they might get caught."\par \par \uc2 Under the ordinance, people seeking to rent property within the city limits will have to first apply for a $5 permit at city hall. Those who declare they are U.S. citizens will have their application approved on the spot, without further questions or documents proving legal status. Those who say they are not citizens will also immediately receive a permit, but will have their legal status checked. If that check does not show them to be in the country legally, they will be given 60 days to prove their legal status. If they fail to do so, police will issue a notice that they have 45 days to leave the property.\par \par \uc2 Only new renters -- not current tenants -- are affected by the ordinance, and landlords who knowingly rent to an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  could be subject to a $100 fine.\par \par \uc2 The ordinance also requires employers within the city to use the federal E-Verify database, which is meant to ensure that employees are allowed to work. However, research company Westat evaluated the system for the Homeland Security Department earlier this year and found that the system wrongly clears illegal workers about 54 percent of the time -- mainly because the system can't detect identity fraud.\par \par \uc2 Nowhere does the ordinance call for local police to arrest suspected illegal immigrants believed to be renting or working in Fremont.\par \par \uc2 The American Civil Liberties Union calls the measure unconstitutional and has promised to file a lawsuit to block enforcement of it. City officials have said they expect the cost of implementing and defending the ordinance in court will average $1 million a year.\par \par \uc2 What will the city get for that price tag? Those opposed to the ordinance say not much. They point to estimates by demographers with the Pew Hispanic Center who estimate Fremont's \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  population at 500 or fewer.\par \par \uc2 Kobach said he believes that figure is low.\par \par \uc2 "Our estimate is between 1,000 and 2,000," Kobach said, based on a variety of sources including comparisons to similarly sized cities with meatpacking plants and estimates from those who organized the petition drive to get the ordinance on the ballot.\par \par \uc2 Election officials plan to certify the vote on the ordinance next week, and it would not go into effect until at least 30 days later, after the City Council has approved the certification.\par \par \uc2 Fremont City Hall was inundated with calls Wednesday after Houston radio talk show host Michael Berry asked listeners to call the city to show support for the ordinance.\par \par \uc2 "We got hundreds of calls yesterday," city administrative assistant Sheila Pettit said. "Every 20 seconds, the phone would ring, and every one of them said the same thing: `We support what you're doing.' My neck was killing me by the time I got home."\par \par \uc2 The ordinance may have become a pain in the neck for at least one city official. City Council President Gary Bolton announced his resignation Thursday, saying in a statement that "a number of community issues" in the past year have taken a physical and emotional toll.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100624e66o002tx\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 BOSTON (AP) - Massachusetts lawmakers negotiating a compromise state budget have rejected key elements of a contentious Senate-backed amendment aimed at cracking down on illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 The compromise version of the budget filed late Wednesday won't require Massachusetts to establish a 24-hour hot line to report suspected \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  workers and won't force the state attorney general to sign an agreement to enforce federal immigration law.\par \par \uc2 Both would have been required under the Senate amendment, which also would require companies doing business with the state to verify that their workers are in the country legally or be barred from future state contracts.\par \par \uc2 Senate Ways and Means Chairman Steven Panagiotakos said the budget will write into law some existing policies regarding illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 "Basically we codified existing regulations, practices and policies of the commonwealth," said Panagiotakos, D-Lowell. "There are a lot of checks in the system and we wanted to make sure those checks stayed in the system."\par \par \uc2 The final budget also rejected another portion of the Senate amendment that would have legally barred illegal immigrants from receiving in-state tuition rates.\par \par \uc2 Panagiotakos said there already is a policy against offering in-state tuition rates to those in the country illegally and there was no need to write it into law.\par \par \uc2 The House had narrowly rejected a similar anti-\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  amendment during its budget debate.\par \par \uc2 Budget negotiators had to grapple with the failure of Congress to extend additional anticipated Medicaid dollars, which will end up costing Massachusetts about $687 million.\par \par \uc2 That forced them to essentially file two budgets: a $27.9 billion plan if the money is approved and a $27.6 billion plan if it isn't.\par \par \uc2 To help close the $687 million hole, budget negotiators diverted nearly $200 million from the state's rainy day fund and made additional, targeted cuts to balance the budget. If Congress eventually approves the money, those cuts would be restored.\par \par \uc2 The final budget plan also would eliminate $56 million in funding for a health care program for immigrants who are in the country legally.\par \par \uc2 Local aid to cities and towns and local school aid would be exempt from further cuts because of the lack of additional Medicaid dollars.\par \par \uc2 "We are under no illusion that this (money) is coming at this point," said House Ways and Means Chairman Charles Murphy, D-Burlington. "We have accounted for that. We've taken responsible steps. We've made very difficult decisions."\par \par \uc2 Panagiotakos and Murphy said they agreed on another controversial issue: what to do with two Suffolk Country holidays, Bunker Hill Day and Evacuation Day, that have long irked workers in the rest of the state.\par \par \uc2 They said the budget would require that all government buildings and offices be open on those days but would not override any collective bargaining agreements with public employee unions.\par \par \uc2 "All the state and municipal offices and agencies, public authorities and quasi-authorities would have to be open for business and fully staffed on those days," Panagiotakos said.\par \par \uc2 The budget also would make changes to the state pension system by capping the maximum amount of state pensions. And it would repeal lifetime appointments to the position of chief of probation.\par \par \uc2 The full House and Senate are expected to approve the budget on Thursday.\par \par \uc2 Gov. Deval Patrick has 10 days to review the budget and make any vetoes. The new fiscal year begins July 1.\par \par \uc2 5\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100624e66o0003j\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc17}{\*\bkmkend toc17}\b \uc2 Some ask: Does Neb. town have illegal immigration problem _ or problem with immigrants?\b0\par\par\uc2 By MARGERY A. BECK   \par \uc2 Associated Press Writer\par \uc2 705 \uc2 words\par \uc2 23 June 2010\par 19:54\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2010.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 FREMONT, Neb. (AP) - In the wake of a newly approved ordinance meant to crack down on illegal immigrants, some question whether Fremont has a problem with people in the country illegally -- or immigrants in general.\par \par \uc2 Supporters of the measure say illegal immigrants have flocked to the eastern Nebraska city of 25,000 to take jobs at two meatpacking plants outside of town.\par \par \uc2 Others -- like Kristin Ostrom, who helped organize opposition to the measure that was approved Monday -- said many people are assuming that the influx of Hispanic immigrants over the last 20 years are people here illegally.\par \par \uc2 "We really don't have an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  problem," Ostrom said. "The majority are here legally."\par \par \uc2 University of Nebraska at Omaha census expert David Drozd said census data from 2006 through 2008 shows there were 1,117 foreign-born residents in Fremont. Of that, 832 were not U.S. citizens. He cautioned that does not mean that they were in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 Based on those numbers, Jeff Passel with the Pew Hispanic Center estimates that Fremont's \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  population might not exceed 500 people -- just 2 percent of the city's population. He estimates about 45 percent of the state's immigrants are undocumented, and that the percentage tends to climb a bit in towns with meatpacking plants.\par \par \uc2 "We're talking hundreds of people, not thousands," Passel said of the number of illegal immigrants in Fremont.\par \par \uc2 The city's ordinance, passed Monday by 57 percent of voters, bans hiring or renting to illegal immigrants. It applies only to rental properties and businesses within city limits. Those who supported it say they fear local jobs were going to illegal immigrants and they were spurred to action to make up for what they see as lax enforcement by federal officials.\par \par \uc2 Jerry Hart is one of three Fremont residents who petitioned for the public vote who doesn't buy the argument that the ordinance is borne out of discrimination. He said the federal government isn't controlling immigration, so Fremont and other communities need local ordinances to protect jobs for legal residents and curb spending on education and medical care for illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 In March, federal authorities indicted 17 people from Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras on fraud, identity theft and related charges following an immigration probe at the \uc2 Fremont Beef Co\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 But local store owner and naturalized U.S. citizen Alfredo Velez said he believes many white residents simply make assumptions about anyone with brown skin.\par \par \uc2 "Some people see the color of our skin and right away think we're illegal," said Velez, who has run his general store carrying products from Mexico and Central America since 1998.\par \par \uc2 Past raids by federal immigration officers on the state's meatpacking plants have not always been met with enthusiasm.\par \par \uc2 In 1999, immigration agents targeted Nebraska meatpacking plants as part of an operation meant to be an example to other employers. Immigration agents had checked thousands of employment forms and identified hundreds of workers they thought might be in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 That operation, however, became more notable for the economic disruption it caused than the arrests, and drew protests from both advocates for immigrant rights and local and business leaders. Nebraska's political leaders demanded that the government back off, complaining that production had fallen sharply as the plants' workers dwindled.\par \par \uc2 Federal immigration officials don't track operations via industry, size or location, said U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokeswoman Gail Montenegro, so she could not say how many raids or audits of employment rolls had taken place in recent years at Nebraska meatpacking plants -- including at Fremont's two plants: Hormel and Fremont Beef.\par \par \uc2 "ICE has to focus its priorities on dangerous criminals, egregious employers, foreign-born gang members," she said. "First and foremost is public safety."\par \par \uc2 Both Hormel and Fremont Beef use the federal E-Verify database, which is meant to ensure that employees are allowed to work.\par \par \uc2 Hormel officials say there have been no federal immigration investigations at the Fremont plant. Fremont Beef officials did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100623e66n002q3\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHOENIX (AP) - "Cuanto?" asks a young man pointing to four bottles of car polish at a recent garage sale in an east Phoenix neighborhood.\par \par \uc2 The question, Spanish for "How much?" sends Minerva Ruiz and Claudia Suriano scrambling and calling out to their friend, Silvia Arias, who's selling the polish. "Silvia!"\par \par \uc2 Arias is out of earshot, so Suriano improvises.\par \par \uc2 "Cinco dolares," she says. "Five dollars." And another sale is made.\par \par \uc2 As the women await their next customer in the rising heat of an Arizona morning, they talk quietly about food and clothes, about their children and husbands. They are best friends, all mothers who are viewed as pillars of parental support at the neighborhood elementary school.\par \par \uc2 All three are illegal immigrants from Mexico.\par \par \uc2 They're holding the garage sale to raise money to leave Arizona, like many others, and to escape the state's tough new law that cracks down on people just like them.\par \par \uc2 The law's stated intention is unambiguous: It seeks to drive illegal immigrants out of Arizona and to discourage them from coming here.\par \par \uc2 There is no official data tracking how many are leaving because of the new law. "It's something that's really tough to get a handle on numerically," said Bill Schooling, Arizona's state demographer. "It's not just the immigration bill. It's also employer sanctions and the economy. How do you separate out the motivating factors?"\par \par \uc2 But anecdotal evidence provided by schools and businesses in heavily Hispanic neighborhoods and by healthcare clinics suggest that sizable numbers are departing. Ignacio Rodriguez, associate director for the Phoenix Roman Catholic diocese's Office of Hispanic Ministries, said churches in the area are also seeing families leave.\par \par \uc2 Priests are "seeing some people approach them and ask for a blessing because they're leaving the state to go back to their country of origin or another state," he said. "Unless they approach and ask for a sending-off blessing, we wouldn't have any idea they're leaving or why."\par \par \uc2 Ruiz and Suriano and their families plan to move this month. Arias and her family are considering leaving, but are waiting to see if the law will go into effect as scheduled July 29, and, if so, how it will be enforced.\par \par \uc2 The law requires police investigating another incident or crime to ask people about their immigration status if there's a "reasonable suspicion" they're in the country illegally. It also makes being in Arizona illegally a misdemeanor, and it prohibits seeking day-labor work along the state's streets.\par \par \uc2 Ruiz, Suriano and Arias are representative of many families facing what they consider a cruel dilemma. To leave, they must pull their children from school, uproot their lives and look for new jobs and homes elsewhere. But to stay is to be under the scrutiny of the nation's most stringent immigration laws and the potentially greater threat of being caught, arrested and deported. They also perceive a growing hostility toward Hispanics, in general.\par \par \uc2 On the quarter-mile stretch of Phoenix's Belleview Street where both Ruiz and Suriano live, more than half the apartments and single-family homes have "for rent" signs out front.\par \par \uc2 Alan Langston, president of the Arizona Rental Property Owners & Landlords Association, said his group doesn't track vacancy rates but that his members believe they will be affected by people leaving because of the new law.\par \par \uc2 The friends say most of the vacancy signs went up after the new law was signed in late April.\par \par \uc2 "Everyone's afraid," Arias says.\par \par \uc2 The three friends are key members of a parents' support group at their children's school down the street, said Rosemarie Garcia, parent liaison for the Balsz Elementary School District.\par \par \uc2 "They are the paper and glue and the scissors of the whole thing," Garcia said. "I can run to them for anything."\par \par \uc2 With two of the women leaving and the other thinking about it, Garcia is concerned about the school's future.\par \par \uc2 "It'll be like a desert here," she said. "It's a gap we'll have all over the neighborhood, the community, our school."\par \par \uc2 Ruiz, Suriano and Arias met three years ago at cafecitos, or coffee talks, held at the school. Now their families hold barbecues together and their children have sleepovers.\par \par \uc2 Arias, 49, and her day laborer husband paid a coyote to come to Arizona 15 years ago from Tepic, Nayarit on Mexico's central-western coast. Their children, ages 9, 11 and 13, are U.S. citizens.\par \par \uc2 "I don't want to leave but we don't know what's going to happen," she says.\par \par \uc2 Ruiz, 38, and her husband, who builds furniture, came to the U.S. from Los Mochis in the northwestern Mexican state of Sinaloa about six years ago on tourist visas, which expired long ago. Two of their kids, ages 9 and 13, are here illegally, while their 1-year-old was born here. The family is moving to Clovis, N.M., where they have family. "It's calmer there," Ruiz says.\par \par \uc2 Suriano, 28, and her husband crossed the desert six years ago with their then-toddler. The boy is now 9, and the couple has a 4-year-old who was born here. They're moving to Albuquerque, where they don't know anyone but already have lined up an apartment and a carpentry job for him.\par \par \uc2 "I don't want to go," Suriano says, wiping away tears. "We're leaving everything behind. But I'm scared the police will catch me and send me back to Mexico."\par \par \uc2 Some people in the neighborhood are not sympathetic.\par \par \uc2 "Bye-bye, see you later," says 28-year-old Sarah Williams, who lives two blocks south of Ruiz and Suriano with her 5- and 7-year-old children and her aunt. "They're taking opportunities from Americans and legal citizens."\par \par \uc2 However, Williams, says she doesn't support Arizona's new law because she believes it will lead to racial profiling.\par \par \uc2 The law still faces several pending legal challenges. The U.S. Justice Department also is reviewing the statute for possible civil rights violations, with an eye toward a possible court challenge.\par \par \uc2 The law's backers say Congress isn't doing anything meaningful about illegal immigration, and so it's the state's duty to step up. They deplore the social costs and violence they say are associated with illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 The law's critics say it will lead to racial profiling and discrimination against Hispanics, and damage ties between police and minority communities.\par \par \uc2 As the debate plays out, dozens of healthcare clinics in central and southern Arizona say many of their Hispanic clients aren't showing up for scheduled appointments. They say they're either afraid to leave the house or they're moving away, said Tara McCollum Plese, a spokeswoman for the Arizona Association of Community Health Centers, which oversees 132 facilities.\par \par \uc2 "Some are actually calling the clinics and asking if it's safe to come, if they need papers," since the new law passed, she said.\par \par \uc2 Sick people avoiding treatment can become a public health problem, she said. "We're actually worried about communicable diseases."\par \par \uc2 If enough people stop going to the clinics, she said, some services could be cut, and some clinics, especially in rural areas, could be forced to close.\par \par \uc2 Schools may face laying off teachers and cutting programs because of fewer students, educators say.\par \par \uc2 Parents pulled 39 children out of Balsz Elementary, which has a 75 percent Hispanic student body, since April 23, the day the law was signed by Republican Gov. Jan Brewer. In the small, five-school district, parents have pulled out 111 children, said district Superintendent Jeffrey Smith, who cites the new law as the leading factor.\par \par \uc2 Smith said each student represents roughly $5,000 in annual funding to the district, so a drop of 111 students would represent roughly a $555,000 funding cut.\par \par \uc2 Many schools across Arizona have seen a steady decline in Hispanic students in recent years, although some district superintendents say the current drop is more dramatic. Schools attribute the declining numbers to the recession and to the state's employer-sanctions law, which passed in 2007 and carries license suspensions and revocations for those who knowingly hire illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Area businesses also say they're seeing the effects of people leaving the state.\par \par \uc2 Steve Salvato, manager at the family-owned World Class Car Wash, just around the corner from Belleview Street, said business is down 30 percent. Salvato said the car wash relies mostly on Hispanic customers and points to the new law for the recent decline in business.\par \par \uc2 "A lot of people have just packed up and moved," he said, adding that a strip mall across the street used to be bustling on weekends. "Now it's like a ghost town."\par \par \uc2 A nearby Food City grocery store reports a 20 percent to 30 percent drop in business.\par \par \uc2 Back at the garage sale, the three friends have a row of tables strewn with Barbie dolls, bicycle helmets, old movies and a Jane Fonda workout video. A laundry basket is overflowing with children's toys, and a shopping cart is filled with clothes.\par \par \uc2 They are selling off pieces of their lives.\par \par \uc2 Their easy banter, mostly in Spanish, quickly turns to tears when they're asked about their impending separation. Ruiz and Suriano have pleaded with Arias to follow them to New Mexico.\par \par \uc2 "They're my companions," Suriano says of the other two women. "We do everything hand-in-hand."\par \par \uc2 9\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100623e66n000e5\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 MAYWOOD, Calif. (AP) - This small city south of downtown Los Angeles plans to lay off almost all its employees, disband its police department and contract municipal operations to a neighboring city.\par \par \uc2 The Maywood City Council said late Monday it had no choice but to adopt the plan. The city faces a deficit of at least $450,000 in its $10.1-million general fund budget, and is unable to get insurance because of a history of lawsuits, many involving the police department.\par \par \uc2 The 1.2-square-mile city plans to hire the Los Angeles County sheriff's department for law enforcement services and the neighboring city of Bell will handle other city services such as finance, records management and parks and recreation.\par \par \uc2 "We're limited on our choices and limited on what we can do," Councilman Felipe Aguirre said. "We don't want to file for bankruptcy. We don't want to disappear as a city."\par \par \uc2 Experts who track California cities said Maywood may be the first example of a city dismissing all top positions except for the city manager, city attorney and elected officials.\par \par \uc2 Under the plan adopted Monday, council members would keep their jobs but all services would be contracted out.\par \par \uc2 The predominantly Latino city has about 45,000 residents and is in the heavily industrial southeast part of Los Angeles County. About half its residents are illegal immigrants, officials estimate.\par \par \uc2 Maywood's troubled history has included shouting matches at council meetings and the police department becoming the focus of a political outcry after running checkpoints that resulted in hundreds of cars being taken from unlicensed illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Critics said the city was trying to squeeze money out of the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  population.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Information from: Los Angeles Times, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.latimes.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.latimes.com}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100623e66n000d2\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc21}{\*\bkmkend toc21}\b \uc2 Illegal immigrant\uc2  families leave Arizona and its tough new law for other parts of US\b0\par\par\uc2 By AMANDA LEE MYERS   \par \uc2 Associated Press Writer\par \uc2 1,536 \uc2 words\par \uc2 22 June 2010\par 17:08\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2010.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHOENIX (AP) - "Cinco dolares," Silvia Arias says when asked the price of car polish at a garage sale that she and two close friends, Minerva Ruiz and Claudia Suriano, are holding. "Five dollars." Another sale is made.\par \par \uc2 The three women planned the sale to raise money to leave Arizona. Though all are longtime residents, viewed as pillars of parental support at the neighborhood elementary school, they're also illegal immigrants from Mexico. And along with many others, they want to escape a tough new state law whose stated intention is unambiguous: To drive illegal immigrants out of Arizona and to discourage them from coming here.\par \par \uc2 There is no official data tracking how many are leaving as a result. "It's something that's really tough to get a handle on numerically," said Bill Schooling, Arizona's state demographer. "It's not just the immigration bill. It's also employer sanctions and the economy. How do you separate out the motivating factors?"\par \par \uc2 Still, anecdotal evidence provided by schools and businesses in heavily Hispanic neighborhoods and by healthcare clinics suggests that sizable numbers are departing. Ignacio Rodriguez, associate director for the Phoenix Roman Catholic diocese's Office of Hispanic Ministries, said churches in the area are also seeing families leave.\par \par \uc2 Priests are "seeing some people approach them and ask for a blessing because they're leaving the state to go back to their country of origin or another state," he said. "Unless they approach and ask for a sending-off blessing, we wouldn't have any idea they're leaving or why."\par \par \uc2 Ruiz and Suriano and their families plan to move this month. Arias and her family are considering leaving, but are waiting to see if the law will go into effect as scheduled July 29, and, if so, how it will be enforced.\par \par \uc2 The law requires police investigating another incident or crime to ask people about their immigration status if there's a "reasonable suspicion" they're in the country illegally. It also makes being in Arizona illegally a misdemeanor, and it prohibits seeking day-labor work along the state's streets.\par \par \uc2 Ruiz, Suriano and Arias are representative of many families facing what they consider a cruel dilemma. To leave, they must pull their children from school, uproot their lives and look for new jobs and homes elsewhere. But to stay is to be under the scrutiny of the nation's most stringent immigration laws and the potentially greater threat of being caught, arrested and deported. They also perceive a growing hostility toward Hispanics, in general.\par \par \uc2 On the quarter-mile stretch of Phoenix's Belleview Street where both Ruiz and Suriano live, more than half the apartments and single-family homes have "for rent" signs out front.\par \par \uc2 Alan Langston, president of the Arizona Rental Property Owners & Landlords Association, said his group doesn't track vacancy rates but that his members believe they will be affected by people leaving because of the new law.\par \par \uc2 The friends say most of the vacancy signs went up after the new law was signed in late April.\par \par \uc2 "Everyone's afraid," Arias says.\par \par \uc2 The three friends are key members of a parents' support group at their children's school down the street, said Rosemarie Garcia, parent liaison for the Balsz Elementary School District.\par \par \uc2 "They are the paper and glue and the scissors of the whole thing," Garcia said. "I can run to them for anything."\par \par \uc2 With two of the women leaving and the other thinking about it, Garcia is concerned about the school's future.\par \par \uc2 "It'll be like a desert here," she said. "It's a gap we'll have all over the neighborhood, the community, our school."\par \par \uc2 Ruiz, Suriano and Arias met three years ago at cafecitos, or coffee talks, held at the school. Now their families hold barbecues together and their children have sleepovers.\par \par \uc2 Arias, 49, and her day laborer husband paid a coyote to come to Arizona 15 years ago from Tepic, Nayarit on Mexico's central-western coast. Their children, ages 9, 11 and 13, are U.S. citizens.\par \par \uc2 "I don't want to leave but we don't know what's going to happen," she says.\par \par \uc2 Ruiz, 38, and her husband, who builds furniture, came to the U.S. from Los Mochis in the northwestern Mexican state of Sinaloa about six years ago on tourist visas, which expired long ago. Two of their kids, ages 9 and 13, are here illegally, while their 1-year-old was born here. The family is moving to Clovis, N.M., where they have family. "It's calmer there," Ruiz says.\par \par \uc2 Suriano, 28, and her husband crossed the desert six years ago with their then-toddler. The boy is now 9, and the couple has a 4-year-old who was born here. They're moving to Albuquerque, where they don't know anyone but already have lined up an apartment and a carpentry job for him.\par \par \uc2 "I don't want to go," Suriano says, wiping away tears. "We're leaving everything behind. But I'm scared the police will catch me and send me back to Mexico."\par \par \uc2 Some people in the neighborhood are not sympathetic.\par \par \uc2 "Bye-bye, see you later," says 28-year-old Sarah Williams, who lives two blocks south of Ruiz and Suriano with her 5- and 7-year-old children and her aunt. "They're taking opportunities from Americans and legal citizens."\par \par \uc2 However, Williams, says she doesn't support Arizona's new law because she believes it will lead to racial profiling.\par \par \uc2 The law still faces several pending legal challenges. The U.S. Justice Department also is reviewing the statute for possible civil rights violations, with an eye toward a possible court challenge.\par \par \uc2 The law's backers say Congress isn't doing anything meaningful about illegal immigration, and so it's the state's duty to step up. They deplore the social costs and violence they say are associated with illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 The law's critics say it will lead to racial profiling and discrimination against Hispanics, and damage ties between police and minority communities.\par \par \uc2 As the debate plays out, dozens of healthcare clinics in central and southern Arizona say many of their Hispanic clients aren't showing up for scheduled appointments. They say they're either afraid to leave the house or they're moving away, said Tara McCollum Plese, a spokeswoman for the Arizona Association of Community Health Centers, which oversees 132 facilities.\par \par \uc2 "Some are actually calling the clinics and asking if it's safe to come, if they need papers," since the new law passed, she said.\par \par \uc2 Sick people avoiding treatment can become a public health problem, she said. "We're actually worried about communicable diseases."\par \par \uc2 If enough people stop going to the clinics, she said, some services could be cut, and some clinics, especially in rural areas, could be forced to close.\par \par \uc2 Schools may face laying off teachers and cutting programs because of fewer students, educators say.\par \par \uc2 Parents pulled 39 children out of Balsz Elementary, which has a 75 percent Hispanic student body, since April 23, the day the law was signed by Republican Gov. Jan Brewer. In the small, five-school district, parents have pulled out 111 children, said district Superintendent Jeffrey Smith, who cites the new law as the leading factor.\par \par \uc2 Smith said each student represents roughly $5,000 in annual funding to the district, so a drop of 111 students would represent roughly a $555,000 funding cut.\par \par \uc2 Many schools across Arizona have seen a steady decline in Hispanic students in recent years, although some district superintendents say the current drop is more dramatic. Schools attribute the declining numbers to the recession and to the state's employer-sanctions law, which passed in 2007 and carries license suspensions and revocations for those who knowingly hire illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Area businesses also say they're seeing the effects of people leaving the state.\par \par \uc2 Steve Salvato, manager at the family-owned World Class Car Wash, just around the corner from Belleview Street, said business is down 30 percent. Salvato said the car wash relies mostly on Hispanic customers and points to the new law for the recent decline in business.\par \par \uc2 "A lot of people have just packed up and moved," he said, adding that a strip mall across the street used to be bustling on weekends. "Now it's like a ghost town."\par \par \uc2 A nearby Food City grocery store reports a 20 percent to 30 percent drop in business.\par \par \uc2 Back at the garage sale, the three friends have a row of tables strewn with Barbie dolls, bicycle helmets, old movies and a Jane Fonda workout video. A laundry basket is overflowing with children's toys, and a shopping cart is filled with clothes.\par \par \uc2 They are selling off pieces of their lives.\par \par \uc2 Their easy banter, mostly in Spanish, quickly turns to tears when they're asked about their impending separation. Ruiz and Suriano have pleaded with Arias to follow them to New Mexico.\par \par \uc2 "They're my companions," Suriano says of the other two women. "We do everything hand-in-hand."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100622e66m002pg\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHOENIX (AP) - Dozens of these young Latino men have crossed the border into Arizona. Some are just teenagers, some are in the United States for the first time. Many don't speak English.\par \par \uc2 Illegal immigrant\uc2  fighter sheriff Joe Arpaio need not be concerned. They already have all the paperwork an immigrant -- and baseball player -- could want.\par \par \uc2 The Arizona Rookie League starts Monday, with some 150 or so prospects from Latin America taking part. Unless a court decides otherwise, the state's much-debated immigration law will take effect on July 29. The season ends a month later.\par \par \uc2 The Cleveland Indians have taken extra precautions to be sure their young Latin players aren't caught unaware and unprepared.\par \par \uc2 "We held a seminar under the direction of our cultural development director, Lino Diaz," said Ross Atkins, the Indians' player development director. "We brought in a local police officer to explain the situation and issued each player an ID card so they don't have to rely on carrying around their visas and paperwork with them."\par \par \uc2 The Milwaukee Brewers believe they are ready for the law, having issued identification cards to their players for the past three years. Each card has the player's photo and information on how to contact Brewers officials if authorities question why the player is in Arizona.\par \par \uc2 "It's a preventative measure," assistant general manager Gord Ash said. "We haven't had any problems so far."\par \par \uc2 The Brewers started the program because they were staying in a crime-plagued part of south Phoenix. The club has since moved to a hotel near the Glendale entertainment district but still issues the cards.\par \par \uc2 The Dominican Republic, as evidenced by big league rosters, is fertile ground for prospects. According to baseballreference.com, 503 Dominicans either have played or are playing in the majors, including Arizona Diamondbacks pitchers Esmerling Vasquez and infielder Tony Abreu.\par \par \uc2 For Dominican players today, the Arizona Rookie League is often the first step into the pro game.\par \par \uc2 The preliminary roster of the San Diego Padres includes 10 players from the Dominican Republic and one apiece from Colombia and Mexico. Their ages range from 19 to 21.\par \par \uc2 This is where concern about the new immigration law comes in.\par \par \uc2 The statute requires police, while enforcing other laws, to ask about a person's immigration status if there is reasonable suspicion that the person is in the country illegally. A young Latin player who speaks no English might fit that description.\par \par \uc2 The law ignited protests around the country, including some at Arizona Diamondbacks road games, by those who feel it encourages racial profiling by unfairly targeting Hispanics.\par \par \uc2 The singing duo of Daryl Hall and John Oates recently canceled a scheduled appearance following a Diamondbacks game to protest the immigration law. There were calls to pull next year's All-Star Game out of Phoenix, but commissioner Bud Selig said play on.\par \par \uc2 Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer, who signed the bill into law, said the state had to do something about illegal immigration because the federal government wasn't.\par \par \uc2 Polls have shown wide support for the law in Arizona and around the country, but at least half-dozen lawsuits have been filed challenging it. The U.S. government may file one, too, so it's uncertain whether the law will take effect as scheduled.\par \par \uc2 Some team officials said they weren't overly concerned because they don't allow players to wander far from the hotel where they are staying.\par \par \uc2 "Major League Baseball has a great relationship with local authorities," Kansas City Royals general manager Dayton Moore said. "... We have local police come in and talk about areas players should avoid. There's security at the hotel. You've got to go out of your way to mess up. That's not to say we don't have situations occur. But when it does happen, it's usually centered around alcohol or females."\par \par \uc2 The issue is not confined to the rookie league. The Cincinnati Reds this year became the 15th major league team to have its spring training facility in Arizona. Players are coming and going all the time, for extended spring training, rehab work or a variety of other reasons. At spring training next year, their numbers will grow to the thousands, from the big league clubs and throughout their minor league systems. A significant percentage will be from Latin America.\par \par \uc2 Many of the ballparks are at the far edges of the suburban sprawl that is greater Phoenix. The San Francisco Giants, though, play in downtown Scottsdale, within walking distance of restaurants, bars and a big shopping mall.\par \par \uc2 "We keep players pretty close to the complex, going to the hotel and mall," said Bobby Evans, the Giants' vice president of baseball operations. "Guys don't have cars or a lot of means of getting out. It's a little different now (with the new law). We haven't had any problems and we don't anticipate any. The players have been there a while now, since spring training, so since the law came out and they know about it. Our staff keeps the players apprised."\par \par \uc2 Tony Reagins, general manager of the Los Angeles Angels, said he's been around player development long enough to know that at some point, some 17- or 18- or 19-year-old will get in trouble.\par \par \uc2 "So you have to give them the proper resources and information, so that at least you can be ahead of it as opposed to trying to react to it,'" he said. "Our staff down there has done a great job of keeping our guys in line."\par \par \uc2 It's business as usual for the Angels in the rookie league -- almost.\par \par \uc2 "We haven't altered the way we develop our players in any way," Reagins said. "We're still sending the same types of players to the Arizona Rookie League and into the state of Arizona, so that hasn't changed. We have just made our players aware that they should have their identification with them at all times. But other than that, we don't see any difference in how we're going to operate."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 AP Baseball Writer Janie McCauley, AP Sports Writers Colin Fly and Doug Tucker and AP freelance writer Chuck Murr contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100618e66i002p4\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHOENIX (AP) - A heavily redacted sheriff's report released Tuesday reveals almost no new details about the March slaying of an Arizona cattle rancher that later became a rallying cry for increased border enforcement.\par \par \uc2 According to earlier reports from authorities and neighbors, Robert Krentz and his dog were gunned down on his property near the Mexico border shortly after he reported spotting someone who appeared to be in trouble\par \par \uc2 The Cochise County sheriff's report released Tuesday said Krentz's all-terrain vehicle was still running and his wounded dog was still was trying to defend him when authorities found his body March 27 in the remote area of his sprawling 35,000-acre ranch northeast of Douglas. The dog later died.\par \par \uc2 Krentz, 58, had been on his ATV checking water lines and fencing when he was shot. Neighbors and law enforcement officials later followed tracks apparently belonging to the killer 20 miles south into Mexico.\par \par \uc2 Sheriff's officials have said they believe Krentz was slain by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who was headed to Mexico and worked as a scout for drug smugglers. But they won't identify any possible suspects and say the investigation is continuing.\par \par \uc2 The sheriff's report also contains a timeline of Krentz's last day. It says he called his brother around 10 a.m. reporting he was with an immigrant who needed help, the last time anyone heard from him.\par \par \uc2 Krentz's wife reported him missing at 6:45 p.m., and authorities found his body about five hours later.\par \par \uc2 An autopsy report released last week showed Krentz had been shot multiple times but revealed little else. It also was heavily redacted.\par \par \uc2 Krentz's killing became a flash point in the immigration debate. A month after the killing, Arizona lawmakers passed the nation's toughest legislation targeting illegal immigration. The law, which goes into effect July 29, requires local and state law enforcement officers to question people about their immigration status if there's reason to suspect they're in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 The Arizona immigration law faces multiple legal challenges and the U.S. Justice Department is reviewing it for possible civil rights violations, with an eye toward a possible court challenge.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Information from: The Arizona Republic, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.azcentral.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.azcentral.com}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100616e66g00069\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

No citizenship for babies born in US to illegal immigrants\b0\par\par\uc2 By MICHELLE PRICE   \par \uc2 Associated Press Writer\par \uc2 807 \uc2 words\par \uc2 15 June 2010\par 19:05\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2010.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHOENIX (AP) - Emboldened by passage of the nation's toughest law against illegal immigration, the Arizona politician who sponsored the measure now wants to deny U.S. citizenship to children born in this country to undocumented parents.\par \par \uc2 Legal scholars laugh out loud at Republican state Sen. Russell Pearce's proposal and warn that it would be blatantly unconstitutional, since the 14th Amendment guarantees citizenship to anyone born in the U.S.\par \par \uc2 But Pearce brushes aside such concerns. And given the charged political atmosphere in Arizona, and public anger over what many regard as a failure by the federal government to secure the border, some politicians think the idea has a chance of passage.\par \par \uc2 "I think the time is right," said state Rep. John Kavanagh, a Republican from suburban Phoenix who is chairman of the powerful House Appropriations Committee. "Federal inaction is unacceptable, so the states have to start the process."\par \par \uc2 Earlier this year, the Legislature set off a storm of protests around the country when it passed a law that directs police to check the immigration status of anyone they suspect is in the country illegally. The law also makes it a state crime to be an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . The measure, which takes effect July 29 unless blocked in court, has inflamed the national debate over immigration and led to boycotts against the state.\par \par \uc2 An estimated 10.8 million illegal immigrants were living in the U.S. as of January 2009, according to the Homeland Security Department. The Pew Hispanic Center estimates that as of 2008, there were 3.8 million illegal immigrants in this country whose children are U.S. citizens.\par \par \uc2 Pearce, who has yet to draft the legislation, proposes that the state of Arizona no longer issue birth certificates unless at least one parent can prove legal status. He contends that the practice of granting citizenship to anyone born in the U.S. encourages illegal immigrants to come to this country to give birth and secure full rights for their children.\par \par \uc2 "We create the greatest inducement for breaking our laws," he said.\par \par \uc2 The 14th Amendment, adopted in 1868 in the aftermath of the Civil War, reads: "All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside." But Pearce argues that the amendment was meant to protect black people.\par \par \uc2 "It's been hijacked and abused," he said. "There is no provision in the 14th Amendment for the declaration of citizenship to children born here to illegal aliens."\par \par \uc2 John McGinnis, a conservative law professor at Northwestern University, said Pearce's interpretation is "just completely wrong." The "plain meaning" of the amendment is clear, he said.\par \par \uc2 Senate candidate Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican and darling of the tea party movement, made headlines last month after he told a Russian TV station that he favors denying citizenship to the children of illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 A similar bill was introduced at the federal level in 2009 by former Rep. Nathan Deal, a Georgia Republican, but it has gone nowhere.\par \par \uc2 The Federation for American Immigration Reform, based in Washington, said Pearce's idea would stop immigrants from traveling to the U.S. to give birth.\par \par \uc2 "Essentially we are talking about people who have absolutely no connection whatever with this country," spokesman Ira Mehlman said. "The whole idea of citizenship means that you have some connection other than mere happenstance that you were born on U.S. soil."\par \par \uc2 Citizenship as a birthright is rare elsewhere in the world. Many countries require at least one parent to be a citizen or legal resident.\par \par \uc2 Adopting such a practice in the U.S. would be not only unconstitutional but also impractical and expensive, said Michele Waslin, a policy analyst with the pro-immigrant Immigration Policy Center in Washington.\par \par \uc2 "Every single parent who has a child would have to go through this bureaucratic process of proving their own citizenship and therefore proving their child's citizenship," she said.\par \par \uc2 Araceli Viveros, 27, and her husband, Saul, 34, are illegal immigrants from the Mexican state of Guerrero. He has been in Phoenix for 20 years, she for 10, and their 2- and 9-year-old children are U.S. citizens.\par \par \uc2 "I am so proud my children were born here. They can learn English and keep studying," Viveros said in Spanish.\par \par \uc2 She said her husband has been working hard in Phoenix as a landscaper, and their children deserve to be citizens. The lawmaker's proposal "is very bad," she said. "It's changing the Constitution, and some children won't have the same rights as other children."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writers Jacques Billeaud and Amanda Lee Myers contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100615e66f0020o\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Obama defends Gulf effort in big speech; Congress raps oil executives for lax preparation\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) -- National anger rising, President Barack Obama is defending his efforts against the country's worst environmental disaster and hoping his first Oval Office address Tuesday night will stoke confidence that he can see the job through until the gushing oil is gone and Gulf Coast lives are back to normal.\par \par \uc2 "We're going to fight back with everything that we've got," Obama said in Pensacola, Fla., capping a two-day inspection tour of the stricken region before flying back to Washington for his evening address to the nation.\par \par \uc2 Eight weeks to the day after an offshore oil rig leased by \uc2 BP PLC\uc2  exploded, killed 11 workers and sent tens of millions of gallons of crude flooding into the Gulf of Mexico, Obama's high-stakes speech came during a week of constantly unfolding drama.\par \par \uc2 Lightning even struck. A bolt hit the ship siphoning oil from the still-spewing undersea leak on -- injuring no one but halting containment efforts for a few hours.\par \par \uc2 Back on land, as long as the oil keeps flowing, no one seems happy with what anyone is doing to deal with it, from Obama on down.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Scientists now say ruptured Gulf well is leaking between 1.47M and 2.52M gallons of oil a day\par \par \uc2 NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Scientists provided a new estimate for the amount of oil gushing from a ruptured well in the Gulf of Mexico on Tuesday that indicates it could be worse than previously thought.\par \par \uc2 A government panel of scientists said that the ruptured well is leaking between 1.47 million and 2.52 million gallons a day of oil. That is an increase over previous estimates that put the maximum size of the spill at 2.1 million gallons per day.\par \par \uc2 "This estimate brings together several scientific methodologies and the latest information from the sea floor, and represents a significant step forward in our effort to put a number on the oil that is escaping from BP's well," Energy Secretary Steven Chu said in a statement.\par \par \uc2 The latest numbers reflect an increase in the flow that scientists believe happened after undersea robots earlier this month cut off a kinked pipe near the sea floor that was believed to be restricting the flow of oil, just as a bend in a garden hose reduces water flow. BP officials has estimated that cutting the kinked pipe likely increased the flow by up 20 percent.\par \par \uc2 The pipe was removed so BP could install a containment cap that is trapping leaking oil and drawing it a ship waiting on the ocean surface.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Colo. construction worker detained in Pakistan on solo mission to hunt down Osama bin Laden\par \par \uc2 DENVER (AP) -- An American man has been detained in the mountains of Pakistan after Pakistani authorities found him carrying a sword, pistol and night-vision goggles on a Rambo-style solo mission to hunt down and kill Osama bin Laden.\par \par \uc2 Friends and family say construction worker Gary Brooks Faulkner is a devout, good-humored Christian who has traveled widely in that part of the world.\par \par \uc2 The 51-year-old Faulkner, who has a lengthy arrest record and served time in a Colorado prison, arrived June 3 in the town of Bumburate and stayed in a hotel there. He was assigned a police guard, as is common for foreigners visiting remote parts of Pakistan.\par \par \uc2 When he checked out without informing police, officers began looking for him, according to the top police officer in the Chitral region, Mumtaz Ahmad Khan. Faulkner was found late Sunday in a forest.\par \par \uc2 "We initially laughed when he told us that he wanted to kill Osama bin Laden," Khan said. But when officers seized the weapons and night-vision equipment, "our suspicion grew." He said the American was trying to cross into the nearby Afghan region of Nuristan.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 AP-GfK Poll: Most dissatisfied with Obama on oil spill, mirrors dismay with Bush on Katrina\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans have become just as dissatisfied with President Barack Obama's work on the Gulf oil spill as they were with his predecessor's handling of Hurricane Katrina, according to an Associated Press-GfK poll released Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 Even so, the catastrophe appears not to have taken a toll on how Americans view the president overall. Obama's approval rating remained steady in the poll and he is more popular than President George W. Bush was two months after the hurricane.\par \par \uc2 Bush alone took the hit in public perceptions. In the spill, much anger is steered at BP, and the poll suggests Americans do not feel quite the sense of shame that afflicted them in the 2005 hurricane aftermath.\par \par \uc2 Still, Obama and his administration have struggled to contain the environmental disaster in the Gulf and now, it seems, to convince people that the government is acting effectively.\par \par \uc2 Most Americans are angry about the government's slow response, the poll finds, with 54 percent saying they had strong feelings about the bureaucracy's reaction. Many doubt that Washington could really help them if they were a disaster victim.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Democrats criticize Iowa lawmaker who says Obama favors blacks over whites\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democrats on Tuesday denounced an Iowa Republican congressman who says President Barack Obama favors blacks over whites, and a GOP candidate from Colorado canceled a fundraiser the Iowan was to keynote.\par \par \uc2 Rep. Steve King, known for sometimes incendiary remarks about immigration, Abu Ghraib and other issues, criticized Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder, who also is black, in an interview Monday on G. Gordon Liddy's nationally syndicated radio talk show.\par \par \uc2 "I'm offended by Eric Holder and the president also, their posture," said King, 61. "It looks like Eric Holder said that white people in America are cowards when it comes to race."\par \par \uc2 King continued: "The president has demonstrated that he has a default mechanism in him that breaks down the side of race on the side that favors the black person in the case of professor Gates and officer Crowley."\par \par \uc2 He was alluding to last year's incident in which Obama commented on a white police officer's arrest of a black professor from Harvard University.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Next on Arizona's agenda? No citizenship for babies born in US to illegal immigrants\par \par \uc2 PHOENIX (AP) -- Emboldened by passage of the nation's toughest law against illegal immigration, the Arizona politician who sponsored the measure now wants to deny U.S. citizenship to children born in this country to undocumented parents.\par \par \uc2 Legal scholars laugh out loud at Republican state Sen. Russell Pearce's proposal and warn that it would be blatantly unconstitutional, since the 14th Amendment guarantees citizenship to anyone born in the U.S.\par \par \uc2 But Pearce brushes aside such concerns. And given the charged political atmosphere in Arizona, and public anger over what many regard as a failure by the federal government to secure the border, some politicians think the idea has a chance of passage.\par \par \uc2 "I think the time is right," said state Rep. John Kavanagh, a Republican from suburban Phoenix who is chairman of the powerful House Appropriations Committee. "Federal inaction is unacceptable, so the states have to start the process."\par \par \uc2 Earlier this year, the Legislature set off a storm of protests around the country when it passed a law that directs police to check the immigration status of anyone they suspect is in the country illegally. The law also makes it a state crime to be an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . The measure, which takes effect July 29 unless blocked in court, has inflamed the national debate over immigration and led to boycotts against the state.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Lightning strike sets 6-story-tall Jesus statue in Ohio on fire, destroys it; no one hurt\par \par \uc2 MONROE, Ohio (AP) -- A six-story statue of Jesus Christ was struck by lightning and burned to the ground, leaving only a blackened steel skeleton and pieces of foam that were scooped up by curious onlookers Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 The "King of Kings" statue, one of southwest Ohio's most familiar landmarks, had stood since 2004 at the evangelical Solid Rock Church along Interstate 75 in Monroe, just north of Cincinnati.\par \par \uc2 The lightning strike set the statue ablaze around 11:15 p.m. Monday, Monroe police dispatchers said.\par \par \uc2 The sculpture, about 62 feet tall and 40 feet wide at the base, showed Jesus from the torso up and was nicknamed Touchdown Jesus because of the way the arms were raised, similar to a referee signaling a touchdown. It was made of plastic foam and fiberglass over a steel frame, which is all that remained Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 The nickname is the same used for a famous mural of the resurrected Jesus that overlooks the Notre Dame football stadium.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Miley Cyrus says she's not trying to be 'slutty,' says she's just comfortable with her body\par \par \uc2 LONDON (AP) -- Miley Cyrus won't be told what she should wear or what she should sing about. The 17-year-old is releasing new album, "Can't Be Tamed," and is doing it her way, even though some say she is going to too far for her age.\par \par \uc2 "I'm not trying to be 'slutty,'" said Cyrus in a recent interview. "I'm not trying to be like, go to the club and get a bunch of guys ... What I'm trying to do is to make a point with my record and look consistent, in the way my record sounds and the way I dress."\par \par \uc2 What she wears has been put under the spotlight recently. Some thought the video for "Can't Be Tamed" was too provocative, and others have criticized her for revealing too much skin in her outfits.\par \par \uc2 Cyrus admits to being partial to shorts and hot pants. But she sees nothing wrong with flashing her legs.\par \par \uc2 "I'm really comfortable with my body, I work really hard to be fit and to know that I can wear whatever makes me most comfortable. I feel more comfortable dressing with a little less, which is just how I've always been," she said.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 St. Louis pet waste removal worker finds $58 packed in dog poop, returns it to customer\par \par \uc2 ST. LOUIS (AP) -- This is why your mother says to wash your hands after handling money: A St. Louis worker found $58 -- packed in dog poop. Steve Wilson works for DoodyCalls Pet Waste Removal. On a recent call, he noticed money sticking out from doggie doo. Wilson wasn't sure what to do, but eventually pulled out the bills, sanitized them, placed them in a plastic zip-locked bag and returned them to the customer. It turned out to be $58.\par \par \uc2 The company said the money was torn, but the serial numbers were identifiable, which means the bills could be returned to a bank and replaced with new money.\par \par \uc2 The Association of Professional Animal Waste Specialists says Wilson is the first person in his profession to find and report money in dog poop.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Braves 3B Chipper Jones meets with team over future, won't comment on possible retirement\par \par \uc2 ATLANTA (AP) -- Struggling through another disappointing season, Atlanta Braves third baseman Chipper Jones told The Associated Press he would meet with team officials Tuesday to discuss his future and acknowledged that he's considering retirement.\par \par \uc2 Jones declined to comment directly on whether he'll retire at the end of the season, but it seemed clear that he's made up his mind and merely needed to work out a settlement with the team over the $28 million in guaranteed money he's owed for the 2011 and 2012 seasons.\par \par \uc2 "It's obvious that it's something I've been thinking about," Jones told the AP after arriving at Turner Field in his blue pickup truck about 2:15 p.m. "I need to go through the proper channels. Once those have all been taken care of, everybody's questions will be answered."\par \par \uc2 The 38-year-old Jones, who won the NL MVP award in 1998 and led the league in hitting just two years ago, said he planned to meet with general manager Frank Wren and manager Bobby Cox to discuss some "red tape issues." Asked if those involved a resolution of his contract, Jones replied, "That would be fair to say."\par \par \uc2 He struggled last season and indicated that another difficult year would likely lead him to consider retirement, even if it meant walking away from a huge amount of money.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100615e66f001b3\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

No estimate has been given yet for how much the project will cost.\par \par \uc2 The move stems from the discovery that Kennesaw State University student was living in the country illegally but paying in-state tuition. That violates a 2006 policy set by Chancellor Erroll Davis that prohibits campuses from giving taxpayer-subsidized tuition rates to undocumented students.\par \par \uc2 Out-of-state tuition is about three times what in-state students pay.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Online:\par \par \uc2 University System of Georgia: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.usg.edu"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.usg.edu}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100611e66b0022b\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) - The three candidates vying to succeed Attorney General Drew Edmondson touched on issues ranging from illegal immigration, consumer protection and federal government intervention in individual rights at a political forum Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 Republicans Ryan Leonard and Scott Pruitt and Democrat Jim Priest addressed a crowd of voters and legal professionals at the Oklahoma City University School of Law just hours after the three-day filing period for candidates for congressional, statewide, legislative and judicial seats closed for the 2010 elections.\par \par \uc2 The attorney general's position is open for the first time in 16 years following Edmondson's decision to step down after four terms to seek the Democratic nomination for governor. Candidates to succeed him said they would retain some elements of the office he has built while changing or expanding others.\par \par \uc2 Leonard and Pruitt expressed concern about the growing power of the federal government and said it is intervening in state and individual rights with such programs as new federal health care overhaul legislation requiring the purchase of health care insurance.\par \par \uc2 Edmondson announced in April he would not join a lawsuit filed in Florida by the attorneys general of other states that challenges the constitutionality of the health care law, saying it would have little chance of success, would drain the office of limited resources and would be "largely an exercise in futility."\par \par \uc2 Leonard, a former prosecutor in Canadian County, said he is concerned about "massive federalization" and believes the attorney general's office should serve as a barrier for Oklahomans by "pushing back and pushing back hard." He said he believes the health care law is unconstitutional and should be challenged.\par \par \uc2 "People are upset about the direction the country is going and they are engaged," Leonard said.\par \par \uc2 Pruitt, who served eight years in the state Senate before running unsuccessfully for the GOP nomination for lieutenant governor in 2006, said he would create a federalism division within the attorney general's office to challenge federal legislation that crosses the legal line.\par \par \uc2 "There seems to be an aggression that's coming," Pruitt said. "I'm pursuing this office because I believe that freedom is at stake."\par \par \uc2 Priest, former general counsel for the Oklahoma Association of Chiefs of Police who has practiced law for 30 years, said he, too, is concerned about "creeping federalism" but believes the state should work with the federal government.\par \par \uc2 He said Oklahoma's sweeping anti-\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  law passed by the Legislature in 2007, House Bill 1804, represents "an outworking frustration" about the federal government's failure to police the borders and prevent illegal immigrants from crossing.\par \par \uc2 "But frustration should not lead to unwise and ill-timed action," Priest said.\par \par \uc2 Priest said one of his top goals as the state's top law enforcement officer will be to protect consumers from fraud and promised to create a cybercrime unit to investigate computer-based crimes against children and the elderly.\par \par \uc2 "My priority -- protect the people of Oklahoma," he said. "I want to stand in the gap for those who have no one to speak for them. I want to be your friend for life."\par \par \uc2 Leonard said he wants to create a positive, consistent legal environment in the state that would make it more attractive to corporate expansion.\par \par \uc2 All the candidates said they keep politics out of the office's operations and work closely with local district attorneys in investigating allegations of public corruption through the state's multi-county grand jury, a statewide investigative tool that is administered by the attorney general's office.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100610e66a0006v\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico (AP) - Mexicans are seething over the second death of a countryman at the hands of U.S. Border Patrol agents in two weeks, an incident near downtown El Paso that is threatening to escalate tensions over migrant issues.\par \par \uc2 U.S. authorities said Tuesday a Border Patrol agent was defending himself and colleagues when he fatally shot the 15-year-old as officers came under a barrage of big stones while trying to detain illegal immigrants on the U.S. side of the Rio Grande.\par \par \uc2 About 30 relatives and friends gathered late Tuesday to mourn Sergio Adrian Hernandez Huereka, whose shooting Monday evening came along the border with Texas. He died on the Mexican side of the river.\par \par \uc2 "Damn them! Damn them!" sobbed Rosario Hernandez, sister of the dead teenager, at a wake in the family's two-room adobe house on the outskirts of Ciudad Juarez.\par \par \uc2 Preliminary reports on the incident indicated that U.S. officers on bicycle patrol "were assaulted with rocks by an unknown number of people," Border Patrol Special Operations Supervisor Ramiro Cordero said Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 "During the assault at least one agent discharged his firearm," he said. "The agent is currently on administrative leave. A thorough, multi-agency investigation is currently ongoing."\par \par \uc2 The shooting happened beneath a railroad bridge linking the two nations, and late Tuesday night a banner appeared on the bridge that said in English: "U.S. Border Patrol we worry about the violence in Mex and murders and now you. Viva Mexico!"\par \par \uc2 Less than two weeks ago, Mexican migrant Anastasio Hernandez, 32, died after a Customs and Border Protection officer shocked him with a stun gun at the San Ysidro border crossing that separates San Diego and Tijuana, Mexico. The San Diego medical examiner's office ruled that death a homicide.\par \par \uc2 Mexican President Felipe Calderon said Tuesday that his government "will use all resources available to protect the rights of Mexican migrants."\par \par \uc2 The government "reiterates its rejection to the disproportionate use of force on the part on U.S. authorities on the border with Mexico," the president added in a statement.\par \par \uc2 On an unpaved street, gathered around Hernandez's gray metal casket, the teen's family called for justice.\par \par \uc2 "There is a God, so why would I want vengeance if no one will return him to me. They killed my little boy and the only thing I ask is for the law" to be applied, said the boy's father, Jesus Hernandez.\par \par \uc2 His mother was less hopeful. "May God forgive them because I know nothing will happen" to them, Maria Guadalupe Huereka said.\par \par \uc2 Above the casket was a photo of the youth wearing his soccer uniform and his junior high school grade cards, which showed A's and B's.\par \par \uc2 His mother said he was a good student who never got in trouble. He was the youngest of five children, played on two soccer teams and had just finished junior high school, she said.\par \par \uc2 The case took a testy turn when U.S. and Mexican officials traded suggestions of misconduct in the incident.\par \par \uc2 Arturo Sandoval, a spokesman for the Chihuahua state Attorney General's office, said a spent .40-caliber shell casing was found near the body -- raising the question of whether the fatal shot was fired inside Mexico, although he did not explicitly make that allegation. That would violate the rules for Border Patrol agents, who are supposed to stay on the U.S. side of the border.\par \par \uc2 A U.S. official, meanwhile, said video shows the Border Patrol agent did not enter Mexico.\par \par \uc2 The official, who agreed to discuss the matter only if not quoted by name, said the video also shows what seem to be four Mexican law enforcement officers driving to the edge of the dry but muddy bed of the Rio Grande, walking across to the U.S. side, picking up an undetermined object and returning to Mexico near the area where the boy's body was. Like their U.S. counterparts, Mexican law officers are not authorized to cross the border without permission.\par \par \uc2 According to the FBI, Border Patrol agents were responding to a group of suspected illegal immigrants being smuggled into the U.S. near the Paso Del Norte bridge, across from Ciudad Juarez around 6:30 p.m. Monday.\par \par \uc2 One suspected \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  was detained on the levee on the U.S. side, the FBI said in a statement. Another Border Patrol agent arrived on the concrete bank where the now-dry, 33-foot (10-meter) wide Rio Grande is, and detained a second person. Other suspects ran back into Mexico and began throwing rocks, the FBI said.\par \par \uc2 At least one rock came from behind the agent, who was kneeling beside a suspected \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  whom he had prone on the ground, FBI spokeswoman Andrea Simmons said.\par \par \uc2 The agent told the rock throwers to stop and back off, but they continued. The agent fired his weapon several times, hitting one who later died, said the FBI, which is leading the investigation because it involved an assault on a federal officer. The agent was not injured, Simmons said.\par \par \uc2 Chihuahua state officials released a statement demanding a full investigation into the death.\par \par \uc2 The boy was shot once near the eye, Sandoval said. Authorities were still investigating the bullet's trajectory, he said.\par \par \uc2 Sandoval said he couldn't comment on the video reported by the U.S. official because he didn't know anything about it. "I am unaware about those hypotheses," he said.\par \par \uc2 Sandoval said Mexican investigators were questioning three teenagers who were with the victim at the time of the shooting.\par \par \uc2 The boy's sister, Rosario, told Associated Press Television News that her brother was playing with several friends and did not plan to cross the border.\par \par \uc2 "They say that they started firing from over there and suddenly hit him in the head," she said.\par \par \uc2 The boy's mother said he had gone to eat with his brother, who handles luggage at a border customs office. While there, he met up with a group of friends and they decided to hang out by the river, she said.\par \par \uc2 "That was his mistake, to have gone to the river," she said in an interview with Mexico's Milenio TV. "That's why they killed him."\par \par \uc2 Mexico's Foreign Relations Department said its records indicate the number of Mexicans killed or wounded by U.S. immigration authorities rose from five in 2008 to 12 in 2009 to 17 so far this year, which is not half over.\par \par \uc2 T.J. Bonner, president of the union representing Border Patrol agents, said rock throwing aimed at Border Patrol agents is common and capable of causing serious injury.\par \par \uc2 "It is a deadly force encounter, one that justifies the use of deadly force," Bonner said.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100609e6690001f\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico (AP) - Pointing their rifles, Mexican security forces chased away U.S. authorities investigating the shooting of a 15-year-old Mexican by a U.S. Border Patrol agent on the banks of the Rio Grande, the FBI and witnesses told The Associated Press on Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 The killing of the Mexican by U.S. authorities -- the second in less than two weeks -- has exposed the distrust between the two countries that lies just below the surface, and has enraged Mexicans who see the death of the boy on Mexican soil as an act of murder.\par \par \uc2 Mexico's government says the number of Mexicans injured by U.S. immigration authorities has increased this year.\par \par \uc2 Shortly after the boy was shot, Mexican soldiers arrived at the scene and pointed their guns at the Border Patrol agents across the riverbank while bystanders screamed insults and hurled rocks and firecrackers, FBI spokeswoman Andrea Simmons said. She said the agents were forced to withdraw.\par \par \uc2 "It pretty quickly got very intense over on the Mexican side," she said, adding that FBI agents showed up later and resumed the investigation, even as Mexican authorities pointed guns at them from across the river.\par \par \uc2 A relative of the dead boy who had been playing with him told the AP that the Mexicans -- who he described as federal police, not soldiers -- pointed their guns only when the Americans waded into the mud in an apparent attempt to cross into Mexico.\par \par \uc2 The Mexican authorities accused the Americans of trying to recover evidence from Mexican soil and threatened to kill them if they crossed the border, prompting both sides to draw their guns, said the 16-year-old boy who asked not to be further identified for fear of reprisal.\par \par \uc2 The confrontation occurred Monday night over the body of Sergio Adrian Hernandez Huereka, who died of his wounds beside the column of a railroad bridge connecting Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, and El Paso, Texas.\par \par \uc2 Each government has made veiled accusations suggesting misconduct on the part of the other's law enforcement agents.\par \par \uc2 Hernandez was found 20 feet (six meters) into Mexico, and an autopsy revealed that the fatal shot was fired at a relatively close range, according to Arturo Sandoval, a spokesman for the Chihuahua state attorney general's office. Mexican authorities said a .40 caliber shell casing was found near the body, suggesting that the Border Patrol agent might have crossed into Mexico to shoot the boy.\par \par \uc2 That would violate the rules for Border Patrol agents, who are supposed to stay on the U.S. side -- and could open the agent to a Mexican homicide prosecution.\par \par \uc2 A U.S. official close to the investigation told the AP that authorities have a video showing that the Border Patrol agent did not cross into Mexico. In fact, the official said, the video shows what appear to be members of Mexican law enforcement crossing onto the U.S. side, picking something up and returning to Mexico. The official was not cleared to speak about the video and spoke only on condition of anonymity.\par \par \uc2 Alejandro Pariente, Chihuahua state's regional deputy attorney general, said the U.S. Border Patrol has given him video which he is reviewing. He declined to describe it except to say that it has sped up the investigation.\par \par \uc2 The two killings have provoked anger in Mexico like no other recent controversy surrounding immigration, including Arizona's new law making it a state crime to be an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  and President Barack Obama's decision to send the National Guard to the border.\par \par \uc2 Although many Mexicans were unhappy with both initiatives, popular and official reaction had been subdued, in contrast to street protests seen in previous years when the U.S. has cracked down on the border. Many Mexicans have since given up hope for a quick solution to the immigration problem, while other issues including growing drug violence have taken center stage in relations between the two countries.\par \par \uc2 That has started to change with the back-to-back deaths of two Mexicans at the border: the teenager killed Monday, and migrant Anastasio Hernandez, 42, who died after a Customs and Border Protection officer shocked him with a stun gun at the San Ysidro border crossing that separates San Diego and Tijuana, Mexico.\par \par \uc2 Anastasio Hernandez, who had lived in the U.S. since he was 14, was buried in San Diego on Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 Among those at the funeral was Humberto Navarrete, who said he was walking across the pedestrian bridge near Tijuana when he witnessed the confrontation and started recording it with his cell phone. In the blurry video, a man can be heard crying and yelling, "Help me! Help me please!"\par \par \uc2 San Diego police detective Kevin Rooney said he is trying to reach Navarrete to see the footage and interview him for his investigation into the case.\par \par \uc2 Mexican news media were filled with images of the 15-year-old's bloody body and his grieving relatives. One tabloid ran a large photograph on its cover, with the banner headline "Gringaderas," salty slang that roughly translates as "things Americans do."\par \par \uc2 Mexican President Felipe Calderon pledged to "use all resources available to protect the rights of Mexican migrants," and his foreign secretary, Patricia Espinosa, said Mexico wasn't taking the Americans' word that the Border Patrol agent had been defending himself from rock-throwers when he opened fire.\par \par \uc2 Chihuahua state Gov. Jose Reyes Baeza blamed the two killings on racism fueled by Arizona's law.\par \par \uc2 "We believe that this killing, the second in recent days in the border between the two countries, is due to xenophobia and racism, derived from the approval of Arizona's anti-immigration law," Reyes said.\par \par \uc2 Mexico's Foreign Relations Department said its records indicate the number of Mexicans killed or wounded by immigration authorities rose from five in 2008 to 12 in 2009 to 17 so far this year, which is not half over. However, two killings in such a short period is rare.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, the Border Patrol released statistics showing that assaults on agents along the border between El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, were on pace to far exceed totals in the previous four years.\par \par \uc2 In the past seven months, Border Patrol agents in the El Paso sector have been assaulted 33 times, compared with 39 times in the entire previous year. Twenty-nine of those incidents were rock-throwing, compared to 31 such incidents in all of fiscal 2009.\par \par \uc2 That's what happened Monday night, when suspected illegal immigrants who ran back to Mexico began throwing rocks at Border Patrol agents detaining other immigrants, Simmons said.\par \par \uc2 At least one rock came from behind the agent, who was kneeling beside a suspected \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  whom he was holding prone on the ground, Simmons said. The agent told the rock throwers to stop, then fired his weapon several times, hitting the boy, she said. The FBI is leading the investigation because it involves an assault on a federal officer.\par \par \uc2 The agent was not injured, Simmons said.\par \par \uc2 T.J. Bonner, president of the union representing Border Patrol agents, said rock throwing aimed at Border Patrol agents is common and capable of causing serious injury.\par \par \uc2 "It is a deadly force encounter, one that justifies the use of deadly force," Bonner said.\par \par \uc2 Mexicans ridiculed that stance.\par \par \uc2 "Let's say that Anastasio and Sergio Adrian attacked the border agents, one with his fists and the other with rocks," columnist Manuel Jauregui wrote in the newspaper Reforma. "Does that mean that killing them was the only valid option?"\par \par \uc2 --------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press Writer Julie Watson in San Diego contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100609e669001rd\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

Statehouse vigil over Senate vote\b0\par\par\uc2 By RUSSELL CONTRERAS   \par \uc2 Associated Press Writer\par \uc2 437 \uc2 words\par \uc2 8 June 2010\par 18:09\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2010.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 BOSTON (AP) - A group of undocumented students and their advocates on Monday launched a round-the-clock vigil outside the Massachusetts Statehouse in protest of a state Senate budget amendment calling for stricter measures aimed at illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Holding signs and placing candles along the Statehouse steps, members of The Student Immigrant Movement vowed to sleep under the shadow of the Statehouse -- through bad weather and the threat of arrest -- until the Senate withdraws the amendment or Gov. Deval Patrick vetoes it.\par \par \uc2 Andres Del Castillo, 19, of Boston, said the students had no choice but to stage a civil disobedience protest against a measure that he said would discriminate against Latinos and other immigrant groups.\par \par \uc2 "This law is actually allowing the public to racially profile," said Del Castillo, a Suffolk University student who was born in Massachusetts. "This is going to create ... an unsafe community where I'm not going to trust my neighbor because I think he might call immigration on me."\par \par \uc2 The measure, passed in the Senate last month by a 28-10 vote, would require companies doing business with the state to verify their workers are in the country legally. It also would create a toll-free phone number to report suspected \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  workers and bar children of illegal immigrants from obtaining the same in-state tuition rates to public colleges as legal Massachusetts residents.\par \par \uc2 Supporters say the measure would help curtail illegal immigration to Massachusetts and save taxpayer money, although no senator could show how it would cut costs. Still, Democratic Sen. Steve Baddour, who backed the measure after pressure from Senate Republicans, called the passage a bipartisan compromise.\par \par \uc2 The measure still must survive budget negotiations between the Senate and the House. The House narrowly rejected a similar amendment.\par \par \uc2 Patrick has not said whether he'd line-item veto the measure if it came to his desk.\par \par \uc2 "If he signs this, he might as well put himself out there as the next Brewer," said Del Castillo, referring to Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer who recently signed a controversial immigration law that has drawn nationwide protest.\par \par \uc2 Bianca Kreiling, 20, also a Suffolk University student, said the student protesters have sleeping bags and supplies needed for days. She said other advocacy groups have promised donations of supplies and money.\par \par \uc2 Six students were scheduled to spend Tuesday night on the Statehouse steps and more are planning to camp out in the coming nights, student said.\par \par \uc2 "We'll be here for as long as it takes," said Kreiling.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100608e6680022q\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - A bill that would require Tennessee jailers to determine whether inmates are in the country illegally and deport them if they are would offer an easy way to fight illegal immigration in the state, the sponsors of the legislation say.\par \par \uc2 "It's one of those things that is so simple, it's almost elegant in its simplicity," Sen. Dolores Gresham said.\par \par \uc2 But some sheriffs consider the bill an unfunded mandate and an invitation to lawsuits.\par \par \uc2 Sheriff Norman Lewis was able to have Montgomery County excluded from the bill. It is one of several counties that could be exempted from the provisions by a special amendment.\par \par \uc2 "First off, I think there are certain liabilities that go with that deal, and sheriffs are not exempt," Lewis said. "And number two, it puts local governments doing what the federal government ought to be doing."\par \par \uc2 The two chambers of the General Assembly have adopted competing versions. The House has rejected efforts in the Senate to exclude some counties from the measure. Lawmakers are hoping to reconcile their differences before the Legislature adjourns this week.\par \par \uc2 Gresham, R-Somerville, said concerns that the bill could lead to racial profiling and lawsuits are a "red herring."\par \par \uc2 "If there's racial profiling going on, since I'm Mexican-American, then I would be in jail," she said.\par \par \uc2 However, Sumner County Sheriff Bob Barker, who is the legislative chairman for the Tennessee Sheriffs' Association, said the potential for lawsuits is one of the biggest concerns sheriffs have had about the measure.\par \par \uc2 "The main concern of sheriffs and the Sheriffs' Association is, 'Let's minimize these issues,'" he said. "Even if you're found not guilty of a violation, it's still very expensive to fight a federal civil rights suit."\par \par \uc2 Barker said an earlier version of the bill had no clear standard for how jailers were supposed to determine immigration status, but the version adopted by the Senate on May 27 requires the state's Peace Officer Standards and Training Commission to develop written rules and procedures.\par \par \uc2 Barker said sheriffs are more comfortable with the new version, but he took issue with the idea that determining immigration status is simple.\par \par \uc2 "I don't know what it's like to run a manufacturing plant because I don't run a manufacturing plant, so I'm not going to say, 'You just do this. It will be real simple and real easy.'"\par \par \uc2 Rep. Vance Dennis, the bill's House sponsor, said the bill is necessary because not all jurisdictions are sharing information with ICE when they arrest someone they suspect is illegally in the country. The Savannah Republican said he has seen the problem first hand in his work as an attorney.\par \par \uc2 "I've seen many instances where someone is incarcerated in a local jail and there's a reasonable suspicion that they're not in the country legally based on factors, most prominent to me, that they are not able to speak English," he said.\par \par \uc2 Immigrant rights advocate Stephen Fotopulos, director of the Tennessee Immigrant and Refugee Rights Coalition, has lobbied against the bill. He said the assumption that someone who isn't fluent in English is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  is just the sort of thing that is likely to get local jailers in trouble.\par \par \uc2 "All U.S.-born citizens from Puerto Rico would be mortified to think that's a legitimate test," he said.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Read SB1141 at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.capitol.tn.gov"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.capitol.tn.gov}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100607e667001qt\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

(AP) - Arizona's tough new immigration law can be traced to white supremacy groups that are attempting to get similar measures passed in other states, a California congresswoman says.\par \par \uc2 Rep. Linda Sanchez's allegations, made to a group of local Democrats, were quickly disputed by Arizona Gov. Jan. Brewer and other supporters of S.B. 1070. The law, which takes effect July 29, requires that police check a person's immigration status if they suspect that individual might be in the country illegally. It also make it a state crime to be an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Sanchez told a dinner meeting of Whittier's Mark Twain Democratic Club on Tuesday that the law is designed to create a system in which minorities can legally be discriminated against.\par \par \uc2 "The Arizona laws are not a mistake," the Southern California Democrat said. "There's a concerted effort behind promoting these kinds of laws on a state-by-state basis by people who have ties to white supremacy groups."\par \par \uc2 Sanchez said her remarks were based on online stories she had read.\par \par \uc2 A spokesman for Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer said the measure was adopted after the federal government failed to take adequate action to curb illegal immigration. Such immigration has turned Arizona into "a super highway of illegal drug and human trafficking," said Brewer spokesman Paul Senseman.\par \par \uc2 On Thursday, Sanchez sought to soften her criticism.\par \par \uc2 "I never said that everyone who supports the Arizona law is a racist or white supremacist," she said.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100604e664001ev\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

Senate candidate faces test of conservative politics, ethnicity in courting Hispanic vote\b0\par\par\uc2 By CHRISTINE ARMARIO   \par \uc2 Associated Press Writer\par \uc2 1,069 \uc2 words\par \uc2 4 June 2010\par 12:09\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2010.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 MIAMI (AP) - At a boutique hotel in Miami's upscale Coral Gables neighborhood, members of a Republican women's group smile and gush as Senate candidate Marco Rubio enters the room. A Spanish-language television reporter approaches with a microphone.\par \par \uc2 What is his stance on the Arizona immigration law? Does he favor amnesty for undocumented immigrants?\par \par \uc2 "I don't support amnesty," Rubio says. "I support a legal immigration system."\par \par \uc2 A Cuban-American lawyer and former state House speaker, the 39-year-old Rubio has captured the attention of national Republicans hoping to attract Hispanic voters, a majority of whom voted for President Barack Obama in 2008.\par \par \uc2 But it's among Hispanic voters that some of Rubio's conservative positions could prove divisive.\par \par \uc2 Last fall he opposed the nomination of Sonia Sotomayor, the country's first Hispanic Supreme Court justice, saying he had concerns about her case history and testimony on issues such as the Second Amendment right to bear arms. He opposes counting undocumented immigrants in the U.S. census and providing them a pathway to citizenship.\par \par \uc2 He suggested in an interview with a conservative publication, Human Events, that even \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  children who have spent most of their lives in the U.S. shouldn't be allowed to stay. He later told The Associated Press: "Young children have to go wherever their parents are."\par \par \uc2 And after initially expressing concerns about Arizona's immigration law, the nation's harshest, Rubio reversed his position and came out in support, saying subsequent changes aimed at preventing racial profiling have greatly improved it.\par \par \uc2 "Most people, what they know about Marco Rubio is that he's a young, well-spoken guy who's Hispanic," said Rep. Juan Zapata, a Republican state representative in Florida who was born in Colombia and supports Rubio's rival Gov. Charlie Crist. "People don't know the details."\par \par \uc2 Zapata said that the Hispanic community would love to support a Latino candidate but that Rubio's views don't further the causes of Hispanic voters.\par \par \uc2 "I've known him for a long time and I've worked with him and I'm terribly disappointed in the positions he's taken," he said.\par \par \uc2 Ana Gomez Mallada, a Republican Cuban-American who is supporting Rubio, said his stance on the Arizona law is "probably irrelevant" with Cuban-American voters.\par \par \uc2 "Will it hurt him with other segments of the Spanish speaking voters? Probably, but not too many," Mallada said. "A lot of segments of Hispanics voters are Democrats anyway and would not vote for Marco anyhow."\par \par \uc2 Both of Rubio's opponents, Crist, who is running as an independent after Rubio's success forced him from the GOP, and the Democratic front-runner, Rep. Kendrick Meek, oppose the Arizona law.\par \par \uc2 Meek, a former Florida Highway Patrol trooper, called the law intrusive and said it wasn't fair to ask law enforcement "to judge a book by its cover." He said that Rubio changed his position in order to appeal to the far right of the Republican Party and that a law like Arizona's would be wrong for Florida and "wrong for a segment of people that would take great pride in his election."\par \par \uc2 Rubio says he is pro-immigrant and doesn't believe his viewpoints on immigration are out of line with constituents.\par \par \uc2 "I think Hispanic voters in America are in favor of the laws being followed," he said in an interview with the AP.\par \par \uc2 Hispanic voters have often voted in favor of ethnicity, but they also have opposed Latino candidates.\par \par \uc2 In 2001, Latino voters in Houston -- mostly Democratic Mexican-Americans -- supported Orlando Sanchez, a Cuban-American mayoral candidate who is a conservative Republican. Five years later, Henry Bonilla, a Mexican-American incumbent running for Congress in Texas, lost to a Democratic challenger, also Hispanic, in part because Latino voters felt he was out of touch with their viewpoints, some even calling him "Henry Vanilla."\par \par \uc2 Former Sen. Mel Martinez, a Cuban-American Republican whose seat Rubio is vying to fill, said the GOP needs to highlight aspects of its beliefs that are consistent with the views of Latino voters. Latinos tend to be strongly religious and against abortion and tilt conservative on social issues.\par \par \uc2 "I think our party speaks to the hopes and wishes of many Hispanic values," Martinez said.\par \par \uc2 Others say linking conservative values to conservative politics won't necessarily translate into votes.\par \par \uc2 "We're conservative, but we vote liberal" is the cliche among Mexican-American voters in Texas, said Tatcho Mindiola, director of the Center for Mexican American Studies at the University of Houston.\par \par \uc2 "I think that race, ethnicity, whatever term you use to call it, is a very important factor in these elections, especially for minority groups," Mindiola said. "The question is always how much of a factor these elements play."\par \par \uc2 Florida has long been the exception among Latino voters. Whereas most Latinos in other states vote Democratic, in Florida a strong bloc of anti-Castro Cuban-Americans has traditionally voted Republican. That is changing, with younger generations and more recent immigrants trending Democratic and Cuban-Americans representing a smaller proportion of the Latino electorate.\par \par \uc2 In 2008, exit polls showed that just over half of Florida Hispanics voted for Obama -- a smaller margin than what he received nationally, where roughly two-thirds of Hispanics favored him over Republican Sen. John McCain. Four years earlier, President George W. Bush received slightly more than half of Florida Hispanics' votes, while his Democratic challenger, Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts, won just over half of Hispanics' votes nationally.\par \par \uc2 Rubio said his message to the Latino community is one of economic empowerment.\par \par \uc2 He also said he wants a federal solution to illegal immigration that would focus first on securing the border and at some point employment enforcement.\par \par \uc2 Crist recently gathered supporters at a cigar shop in Miami. Afro-Cuban music played in the background. Cigars were rolled and sealed with a blue "Charlie Crist for U.S. Senate" label.\par \par \uc2 Franco Caliz, 21, a Democrat whose family is from Nicaragua, was one of many at the event.\par \par \uc2 Rubio is "flip-flopping, I think, on the most important issue to Latinos right now, which is the Arizona immigration (law)," Caliz said of Rubio. "I don't think ethnicity matters. I think what matters is his ideology."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100604e664000ph\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

HURST   \par \uc2 Associated Press Writer\par \uc2 852 \uc2 words\par \uc2 4 June 2010\par 01:01\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2010.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) - President Barack Obama confronted the country's raging immigration debate in a meeting with Arizona's conservative Republican governor, who says she gave no ground on the explosive political issue.\par \par \uc2 She called Thursday's 30-minute White House meeting "very cordial." Obama said it was "good." But there was nothing in the comments of either the president or Gov. Jan Brewer to suggest they had done anything more than agree to disagree and keep the dialogue open.\par \par \uc2 With polls showing nearly six in 10 Americans backing the Arizona law, the immigration issue weighs heavily not only on Obama but also on fellow Democrats in Congress.\par \par \uc2 They were already expected to suffer significant losses in November elections. Some analysts say Democratic majorities in both the House of Representatives and the Senate are in danger.\par \par \uc2 The president and Democrats are already battling against voter anger over the slow economic recovery, the passage of health care reform and to a degree the government's handling of the ongoing and massive oil spill tragedy in the Gulf of Mexico.\par \par \uc2 But Republicans also are finding incumbents in disfavor and immigration threatens to diminish their support among the country's Hispanic population.\par \par \uc2 Obama says the Arizona law is misguided and discriminatory. It makes crossing the border illegally a state crime and requires police to verify people's immigration status if the officer has "reasonable suspicion" the person is in the United States illegally.\par \par \uc2 Obama has ordered his Justice Department to review the law to determine whether it violates civil rights. It has sparked massive protests as well as economic boycotts of Arizona from communities as large as Los Angeles.\par \par \uc2 The president wants a reform measure that takes account of the reality of the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  population and would give those in the country without documentation a means of overcoming their situation.\par \par \uc2 It would require them to pay taxes, perhaps a fine, learn English and move to the back of the line of those people seeking to enter the country legally.\par \par \uc2 But the issue is so hot, it was unlikely that members of Congress would take up the issue as the legislative year dwindles toward November.\par \par \uc2 The number of illegal immigrants has fallen by about 10 percent because of the recession-shrunken job market, but the government estimates that there still are nearly 11 million people in the country without permission.\par \par \uc2 The Arizona governor emerged from the White House saying she and Obama agreed to stay in closer contact and that he promised administration officials would be in her state within two weeks for a closer look at the immigration problem.\par \par \uc2 The governor also said Obama assured her that most of the 1,200 National Guard troops he is sending to the southern border would be going to her state.\par \par \uc2 Under pressure to take action, Obama last week ordered the National Guard troops to boost security along the U.S.-Mexico border, pre-empting Republican efforts to force a congressional vote to send the troops.\par \par \uc2 Obama also is requesting $500 million for border protection and law enforcement activities.\par \par \uc2 The president took action after he was all but compelled to do something when the Arizona measure thrust the border problem into the public spotlight.\par \par \uc2 The political fallout of the immigration issue -- felt nationwide -- finds special expression in the major rightward shift by Arizona Sen. John McCain -- Obama's opponent in the 2008 presidential election.\par \par \uc2 Now, facing a primary challenge from a former House member and right wing radio host, McCain has moved from having authored an immigration reform bill in 2007 to declaring he could no longer support it until U.S. borders are more secure.\par \par \uc2 His proposal was not far from that of Obama. It now hews closely to the most conservative Republican line on immigration.\par \par \uc2 The issue is also straining relations with Mexico, the United States southern neighbor and source of many immigrants, both legal and illegal.\par \par \uc2 Addressing Congress on a state visit last month, Mexican President Felipe Calderon was openly critical of the Arizona measure.\par \par \uc2 "It is a law that not only ignores a reality that cannot be erased by decree but also introduces a terrible idea using racial profiling as a basis for law enforcement," he said to cheers, mainly from the Democratic side of the chamber.\par \par \uc2 He warned of the risk when "core values we all care about are breached."\par \par \uc2 But that's a hard argument for a population concerned about jobs and the flow of drugs that is deeply enmeshed in extreme violence by drug gangs south of the border.\par \par \uc2 But the issue now may have become more about politics than reality.\par \par \uc2 FBI crime reports for 2009 says violent crime in Arizona had declined. And violent crimes in southwest border counties are among the lowest in the nation per capita -- they've dropped by more than 30 percent in the last two decades. Of America's 25 largest cities, San Diego, California -- with one out of four residents an immigrant -- has the lowest number of violent crimes per capita.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100604e664000bc\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

HURST   \par \uc2 Associated Press Writer\par \uc2 902 \uc2 words\par \uc2 3 June 2010\par 20:31\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2010.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) - President Barack Obama confronted the country's raging immigration debate in a meeting with Arizona's conservative Republican governor, who says she gave no ground to the president on the explosive political issue.\par \par \uc2 Gov. Jan Brewer nevertheless called Thursday's 30-minute White House meeting "very cordial." Obama said it was "good." There was nothing in the comments of either the president or the governor to suggest they had done anything more than agree to disagree and keep the dialogue open.\par \par \uc2 With polls showing almost six in 10 Americans supporting the Arizona law, the immigration issue weighs heavily not only on Obama but also on fellow Democrats in Congress.\par \par \uc2 They were already expected to suffer significant losses in November elections. Some analysts say Democratic majorities in both the House of Representatives and the Senate are in danger.\par \par \uc2 The president and Democrats already are confronting voter anger over the country's slow economic recovery, the passage of health care reform and to a degree the government's handling of the continuing massive oil spill tragedy in the Gulf of Mexico.\par \par \uc2 Republicans also are finding incumbents in disfavor, however, and immigration threatens to diminish their support among the country's Hispanic population, which has become in recent years the largest U.S. minority.\par \par \uc2 Obama says the Arizona law is misguided and discriminatory. It makes crossing the border illegally a state crime and requires police to verify people's immigration status if an officer has "reasonable suspicion" a person legally confronted for cause might be in the United States illegally.\par \par \uc2 Obama has ordered his Justice Department to review the law to determine whether it violates civil rights. It has sparked massive protests as well as economic boycotts of Arizona from communities as large as Los Angeles, California.\par \par \uc2 The president wants national immigration legislation that would take account of the reality of the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  population and would give those in the country without documentation a means of overcoming their situation.\par \par \uc2 It would require them to pay taxes, perhaps a fine, learn English and move to the back of the line of those people who seek to enter the country legally.\par \par \uc2 The issue is so hot, however, that it was unlikely that members of Congress would take it up as the legislative year dwindles toward November. That is when all 435 seats in the House of Representatives and 36 of the 100 Senate seats will go before the electorate.\par \par \uc2 The number of illegal immigrants has fallen by about 10 percent because of the recession-shrunken job market, but the government estimates that there still are close to 11 million people in the country without permission.\par \par \uc2 The Arizona governor emerged from the White House saying she and Obama agreed to stay in closer contact, and he promised administration officials would be in her state within two weeks for a closer look at the immigration problem.\par \par \uc2 The governor also said Obama assured her that most of 1,200 National Guard troops he is sending to the southern border would be going to her state.\par \par \uc2 Under pressure to take action, Obama last week ordered the National Guard troops to boost security along the U.S.-Mexico border, pre-empting Republican efforts to force a congressional vote to send the troops.\par \par \uc2 Obama also is requesting $500 million for border protection and law enforcement activities.\par \par \uc2 The president took action after he was all but compelled to do something when the Arizona measure thrust the border problem into the public spotlight.\par \par \uc2 The political fallout of the immigration issue, which is felt nationwide, finds special expression in the major rightward shift by Arizona Sen. John McCain, -- Obama's opponent in the 2008 presidential election.\par \par \uc2 Now, facing a primary challenge from a former House member and right-wing radio host, McCain has moved from having authored an immigration reform bill in 2007 to declaring he could no longer support it until U.S. borders are more secure.\par \par \uc2 McCain's original proposal was not far from Obama's position. His current stand hews closely to the most conservative Republican line on immigration.\par \par \uc2 The issue also is straining relations with Mexico, the United States' southern neighbor and source of many immigrants, both legal and illegal.\par \par \uc2 Addressing Congress on a state visit last month, Mexican President Felipe Calderon was openly critical of the Arizona measure.\par \par \uc2 "It is a law that not only ignores a reality that cannot be erased by decree but also introduces a terrible idea using racial profiling as a basis for law enforcement," he said to cheers, mainly from the Democratic side of the chamber.\par \par \uc2 He warned of the risk when "core values we all care about are breached."\par \par \uc2 That is a hard argument for a population concerned about jobs and the flow of drugs that is deeply enmeshed in extreme violence by drug gangs south of the border.\par \par \uc2 But the issue now may have become more about politics than reality.\par \par \uc2 FBI crime reports for 2009 say violent crime in Arizona had declined. And violent crimes in southwest border counties are among the lowest in the nation per capita -- they have dropped by more than 30 percent in the past two decades. Of America's 25 largest cities, San Diego, California, where one out of four residents is an immigrant, has the lowest number of violent crimes per capita.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100604e6640002d\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc46}{\*\bkmkend toc46}\b \uc2 LT Mexico US Safer Border\b0\par\par\uc2 By MARTHA MENDOZA   \par \uc2 Associated Press Writer\par \uc2 1,435 \uc2 words\par \uc2 3 June 2010\par 19:00\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2010.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 MEXICO CITY (AP) - It's one of the safest parts of America, and it's getting safer.\par \par \uc2 It's the U.S.-Mexico border, and even as politicians say more federal troops are needed to fight rising violence, government data obtained by The Associated Press show it actually isn't so dangerous after all.\par \par \uc2 The top four big cities in America with the lowest rates of violent crime are all in border states: San Diego, Phoenix, El Paso and Austin, according to a new FBI report. And an in-house Customs and Border Protection report shows that Border Patrol agents face far less danger than street cops in most U.S. cities.\par \par \uc2 The Customs and Border Protection study, obtained with a Freedom of Information Act request, shows 3 percent of Border Patrol agents and officers were assaulted last year, mostly when assailants threw rocks at them. That compares with 11 percent of police officers and sheriff's deputies assaulted during the same period, usually with guns or knives.\par \par \uc2 In addition, violent attacks against agents declined in 2009 along most of the border for the first time in seven years. So far this year assaults are slightly up, but data is incomplete.\par \par \uc2 "The border is safer now than it's ever been," said U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesman Lloyd Easterling.\par \par \uc2 He said one factor is that with fewer jobs available amid the U.S. recession, illegal immigration has dropped. And responding to security concerns after 9-11, the Border Patrol has doubled the number of agents in the region since 2004.\par \par \uc2 Nonetheless, border lawmakers and governors say their region is under siege and needs more troops.\par \par \uc2 "Violence in the vicinity of the U.S.-Mexico border continues to increase at an alarming rate. We believe that this violence represents a serious threat to the national security of the United States as well as a serious threat to U.S. citizens that live along the 1,969-mile long border," a dozen bipartisan members of Congress from border states wrote President Obama.\par \par \uc2 In Arizona, a stringent new immigration law takes effect next month, requiring police to question suspects' immigration status if officers believe they're in the country illegally. Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer said in a televised interview last weekend: "We are out here on the battlefield getting the impact of all this illegal immigration, and all the crime that comes with it."\par \par \uc2 In response to the concerns from the border states, Obama pledged to send 1,200 National Guard troops to help and spend an extra $500 million on border security.\par \par \uc2 His one-time rival for the presidency, Arizona Sen. John McCain, said he should send at least 6,000 troops, which are needed because he said Arizona leads the nation in marijuana seizures, suffered 368 kidnappings in 2008 and has the highest property crime rates in the U.S.\par \par \uc2 But FBI crime reports for 2009 says violent crime in Arizona declined. And violent crimes in southwest border counties are among the lowest in the nation per capita -- they've dropped by more than 30 percent in the last two decades. Of America's 25 largest cities, San Diego -- with one out of four residents an immigrant -- has the lowest number of violent crimes per capita.\par \par \uc2 Opponents of increased border security are frustrated by descriptions of a wave of violence when the statistics show the region to be relatively safe.\par \par \uc2 "Politicians are hyping up this incredible fear across the country about the border, but these numbers show these are lies being perpetrated on the American public," said immigrant advocate Isabel Garcia at Tucson-based Derechos Humanos. "The warnings about violence are just an excuse to crack down on migrants who want to work and be with their families."\par \par \uc2 Even residents of the border region who want more security are surprised by the talk of violence.\par \par \uc2 "I have to say, a lot of this is way overblown," said Gary Brasher of Tuboc, Arizona, who is president of the Coalition for a Safe and Secure Border.\par \par \uc2 So why send troops to the region?\par \par \uc2 "That's really something to ask the White House," Easterling said.\par \par \uc2 White House spokesman Mike Hammer said "there are other rationales for why those border deployments are occurring" but declined to name any of them. "I would really put this to the Department of Homeland Security," he said.\par \par \uc2 Homeland Security spokesman Matthew Chandler provided a written statement that said more help is needed to build upon "the unprecedented resources the Administration has dedicated over the past 16 months and will serve to expand long-term the successes that have been realized to date."\par \par \uc2 Governors along the border say improved crime rates don't counter their concerns about risk.\par \par \uc2 "The federal government currently does not know who is entering our country and when, which obviously creates tremendous security concerns," said Brewer's spokesman Paul Senseman.\par \par \uc2 And in Texas, "we respond to threats based on risk, not occurrence," said Gov. Rick Perry's spokeswoman Katherine Cesinger. Thus Perry has activated a secret state border protection emergency plan.\par \par \uc2 "With the safety of Texans on the line, we can't afford to wait," he said.\par \par \uc2 New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, who ordered the National Guard to patrol the border in his state six weeks ago, is concerned about "the potential for drug cartel violence spilling over the border," spokesman Gilbert Gallegos said.\par \par \uc2 California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger spokesman Francisco Castillo said that while "we've seen some success," troops are needed "to provide more security along our borders."\par \par \uc2 Concerns about danger come, in part, from Mexico, where raging cartel violence has taken 23,000 lives in three years, often within view of the U.S. border. There's frequent talk of the potential for that violence to spread across the border, although so far it hasn't happened to any significant degree.\par \par \uc2 Several high-profile and frightening incidents have added to the fears: Authorities suspect an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  working for drug smugglers killed Arizona rancher Robert Krentz in March, and last year Border Patrol agent Robert Rosas, 30, was murdered while on patrol near San Diego.\par \par \uc2 "Agents now have to question if they will be ambushed," U.S. District Judge M. James Lorenz said as he sentenced a 17-year-old Mexican to 40 years for killing Rosas.\par \par \uc2 In fact, agents in the San Diego region are less likely to be attacked these days.\par \par \uc2 "Agent Rosas' death changed the way we do business. Agents are on high alert, we have to be ready. But if you just look at the numbers, assaults here are down 27 percent," said Border Patrol spokesman Jerry Conley, who worked with Rosas. He said that since Rosas' death, officers don't venture into potentially dangerous situations without backup. Solo patrols are rare, and they emphasize safety precautions.\par \par \uc2 There are exceptions to the trend: Assaults on agents in the Laredo, Texas, region increased from 44 in 2008 to 118 in 2009, and they increased in the neighboring Rio Grande Valley as well. Agents also fired their guns on 49 separate occasions in 2009, a 50 percent increase from 2008.\par \par \uc2 Customs spokesman Easterling said that while fewer people are trying to sneak across the border, those who do are more likely "engaged in activity other than illegal entry, such as drug smuggling, and are more likely to use violence as a means to help them escape apprehension."\par \par \uc2 But the bigger picture is one of increased safety. In fiscal year 2009, there were 1,073 violent attacks -- mostly thrown rocks, bottles and sticks but also 48 incidents in which a gun was fired -- against the 20,119 Border Patrol agents, down from 1,097 violent incidents against 17,819 agents in 2008.\par \par \uc2 In addition to those agents, another 22,000 officers work at the nation's border crossings and airports, checking people as they enter and exit the country.\par \par \uc2 It's one of the safest jobs in law enforcement: Last year 17 of them were assaulted, a 74 percent decrease from 2008.\par \par \uc2 Edward Alden, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said it's time for lawmakers to reconsider what they'd like to see happening in the region.\par \par \uc2 "Border security has become the most overused, and least understood, concept in the struggle over what to do about our broken immigration system," he said. "While an election year may not be the best time, the United States finally needs an honest debate over what it means to secure the country's borders."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100603e66300171\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 BOSTON (AP) - They gather on statehouse steps with signs and bullhorns, risking arrest. They attend workshops on civil disobedience and personal storytelling, and they hold sit-ins and walk out of class in protest. They're being warned that they could even lose their lives.\par \par \uc2 Students fighting laws that target illegal immigrants are taking a page from the civil rights era, adopting tactics and gathering praise and momentum from the demonstrators who marched in the streets and sat at segregated lunch counters as they sought to turn the public tide against racial segregation.\par \par \uc2 "Their struggle then is ours now," said Deivid Ribeiro, 21, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Brazil and an aspiring physicist. "Like it was for them, this is about survival for us. We have no choice."\par \par \uc2 Undocumented students, many of whom consider themselves "culturally American" because they have lived in the U.S. most of their lives, don't qualify for federal financial aid and can't get in-state tuition rates in some places. They are drawing parallels between themselves and the 1950s segregation of black and Mexican-American students.\par \par \uc2 "I think it's genius," said Amilcar Shabazz, chairman of the W.E.B. DuBois Department of Afro-American Studies at the University of Massachusetts. "If you want to figure out how to get your story out and change the political mood in America, everybody knows the place to start your studies is the civil rights movement."\par \par \uc2 For two years, Renata Teodoro lived in fear of being deported to her native Brazil, like her mother, brother and sister. She reserved her social contact for close friends, was extra careful about signing her name anywhere, and fretted whenever anyone asked about her immigration status, because she been living illegally in the United States since she was 6.\par \par \uc2 Yet on a recent afternoon, Teodoro gathered with other illegal immigrants outside the Massachusetts Statehouse with signs, fliers and a bullhorn -- then marched the streets of Boston, putting herself in danger of arrest by going public but hoping her new openness would prompt action on the DREAM Act, a federal bill to allow people like her a pathway to citizenship via college enrollment or military service.\par \par \uc2 "I don't care. I can't live like this anymore," said Teodoro, 22, a leader of the Student Immigration Movement and a part-time student at UMass-Boston. "I'm not afraid, and I have to take a stand."\par \par \uc2 The shift has been building, said Tom Shields, a doctoral student at Brandeis University in Waltham who is studying the new student movement.\par \par \uc2 "In recent months, there has been an interest in connecting the narrative of their struggle to the civil rights effort for education," Shields said.\par \par \uc2 The movement has gained attention of Congress. Sens. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., and Richard Lugar, R-Ind., sent a letter to Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano in April, asking her to halt deportations of immigrant students who could earn legal status under DREAM, which stands for the Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors act, and which they're sponsoring.\par \par \uc2 Last month, three \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students demanding to meet with Arizona Sen. John McCain about DREAM were arrested and later detained for refusing to leave his Tucson office. High school and college students in Chicago and Denver walked out of class this year to protest Arizona's tough new law requiring immigrants to carry registration papers. In December, immigrant students staged a "Trail of Dreams" march from Miami's historic Freedom Tower to Washington, D.C., to raise support for DREAM.\par \par \uc2 Similar student immigrant groups have sprung up at the University of California at Los Angeles and the University of Houston.\par \par \uc2 By attaching themselves to the civil rights movement, Shabazz said, the immigrant students can claim the moral high ground and underdog status of the debate.\par \par \uc2 "The question now is ... can they convince moderate, middle-of-the-road, independent voters to support them?" he said.\par \par \uc2 The Rev. William Lawson, an 81-year-old civil rights leader and retired pastor of Wheeler Avenue Baptist Church in Houston, called the student activists' tactics courageous and said he'd like to meet them. But Lawson, who marched with Martin Luther King Jr., cautioned student immigrant activists to prepare for peers getting arrested, deported or possibly killed.\par \par \uc2 "You do have to expect consequences. Many civil rights activists faced injury, sometimes death," said Lawson. "And I'm not sure how many of these (students) understand the fundamental philosophy of nonviolence."\par \par \uc2 Students have to keep in mind the audience they're trying to win over, said Lonnie King, 73, a founder of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, the group responsible for sit-ins at segregated restaurants across the South in the 1960s.\par \par \uc2 "They need to understand that the bulk of folks are in the middle," King said. "They have to coach their message to make it broadly appealing."\par \par \uc2 In Massachusetts, hundreds of student activists have gone through training by Marshall Ganz, a public policy lecturer at Harvard Kennedy School and a former organizer with the late Cesar Chavez of the United Farm Workers movement. At special camps, students attend workshops on civil disobedience, storytelling and media outreach.\par \par \uc2 Students who have attended the workshops even continue to use the well-known farm workers' rallying clap at the end of organizing meetings.\par \par \uc2 "They know that clap," Ganz said, "because I taught them that clap. It's all about the experience."\par \par \uc2 Teodoro said the training changed her life and showed her the cause was larger than herself.\par \par \uc2 During the rally last week in Boston, she led a march from the Massachusetts Statehouse to Sen. Scott Brown's office at the John F. Kennedy federal building, which also houses U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement offices. Along with Carlos Savio Oliveira, 22, of Falmouth, Mass., another \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , the pair walked into the federal building to hand Brown's staff 1,500 letters of support for the DREAM Act.\par \par \uc2 Outside supporters wore T-shirts with the words "Brown is beautiful" -- a pun referring to the Chicano movement chant and Brown's well-publicized nude photo spread in Cosmopolitan magazine as a college student.\par \par \uc2 Brown, whose office was previously the site of a sit-in by the same group, has not said whether he supports the bill.\par \par \uc2 In September, Teodoro and a dozen other students also took a weeklong trip from Boston to the South, with Shields driving.\par \par \uc2 Along the way, they met with black former students who desegregated Clinton High School in Tennessee and Little Rock Central High School in Arkansas. They visited civil rights museums and filmed the journey for a planned documentary. But the highlight was meeting Carlotta Walls LaNier, a member of the Little Rock Nine.\par \par \uc2 Teodoro cornered LaNier at a book signing of her memoir, "A Mighty Long Way: My Journey to Justice at Little Rock Central High School."\par \par \uc2 "I went up to her at the signing and told her my story and tried not to cry," Teodoro said. "She listened.

Patrick: Senate plan to crack down on illegal immigrants may be too costly\b0\par\par\uc2 By STEVE LEBLANC   \par \uc2 Associated Press Writer\par \uc2 614 \uc2 words\par \uc2 1 June 2010\par 18:05\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2010.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 BOSTON (AP) - Gov. Deval Patrick expressed skepticism Tuesday about a tough Senate-approved crackdown on illegal immigrants and questioned if the state could afford to pay for the new measures, even as he acknowledged he hadn't read the 22-page budget amendment.\par \par \uc2 Patrick said if the plan simply reaffirms steps the state is already taking, he's not sure it adds anything to the debate.\par \par \uc2 But Patrick declined to say whether he'd support or veto portions of the measure that go far beyond current law, including the creation of a hot line to let residents report suspected \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  workers.\par \par \uc2 "It will be interesting to see if anyone is going to fund the staffing for that hot line," Patrick told reporters before heading into a meeting with legislative leaders Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 Supporters of the wide-ranging proposal haven't been able to say how much the various measures would end up costing taxpayers.\par \par \uc2 "We have more than enough to do enforcing existing state law on a whole host of areas," Patrick said. "The idea of having limited state resources take on federal responsibilities does not seem to me to be practical."\par \par \uc2 Patrick isn't the only top figure on Beacon Hill distancing himself from the Senate plan, which is intended to clamp down on the ability of illegal immigrants to obtain a range of state services from Medicaid to public housing.\par \par \uc2 Democratic House Speaker Robert DeLeo also said he hadn't read the Senate measure.\par \par \uc2 "Right now I couldn't say if I like parts of it, all of it, none of it, whatever. I think it's much too premature," DeLeo said before heading into the same meeting. "I haven't even looked at it."\par \par \uc2 Attorney General Martha Coakley also questioned the cost of the plan.\par \par \uc2 Besides overseeing the hot line, Coakley would be authorized under the Senate amendment to enter into a "memorandum of understanding" with the U.S. attorney general to work collaboratively to enforce the nation's immigration laws.\par \par \uc2 Coakley said she understood frustration about the nation's immigration policy and said the federal government needs a comprehensive response.\par \par \uc2 If the measure becomes law, Coakley said she'd do her best to work with federal law enforcement "while best addressing all of our law enforcement priorities, including maintaining public safety in our communities and taking on companies that violate our labor laws to gain an unfair advantage over other businesses."\par \par \uc2 Senate President Therese Murray, who didn't vote on the amendment, has also refused to embrace the measure, calling parts of it "unfortunate."\par \par \uc2 "I don't necessarily agree with everything that's in it, Murray, D-Plymouth, said after the vote.\par \par \uc2 The Senate voted 28-10 on Thursday to back the measure as an amendment to its version of the state budget.\par \par \uc2 The measure would also require companies doing business with the state to verify that their workers are in the country legally. It would bar children of illegal immigrants from obtaining the same in-state tuition discount to public colleges as legal Massachusetts residents.\par \par \uc2 The measure faces an uphill climb.\par \par \uc2 It must first survive closed-door budget negotiations between a six-member House and Senate committee charged with drafting a final version of the budget. The House narrowly rejected a similar amendment during its budget debate.\par \par \uc2 Even if it makes it into the final budget, it must then survive any possible veto by Patrick.\par \par \uc2 The amendment has sparked criticism from immigrant activist groups. On Thursday, they plan to rally at the Statehouse to protest the proposal.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100601e661002bi\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 LOS ANGELES (AP) - About 150 protesters attended a rally against Arizona's tough new crackdown on illegal immigration in front of Dodger Stadium on Monday during a game between the Arizona Diamondbacks and the Dodgers.\par \par \uc2 The picketers gathered outside stadium entrances and held signs protesting the new Arizona law, which would require police to ask about people's immigration status if they have "reasonable suspicion" that they're in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 Protesters also said they wanted the Dodgers to move their spring training facility out of Arizona and for Major League Baseball to move the 2011 All-Star game out of the state.\par \par \uc2 "It's important for the Dodgers to take a stand," said Mike Chavez, spokesman for Service Employees International Union, which helped organize the protest. "They have a history of standing up against discrimination and we're asking them to do something to show some leadership."\par \par \uc2 Before the game, Dodgers manager Joe Torre said, "A stand against what? Letting this club into town? Talk to the people higher up."\par \par \uc2 Arizona's new law is set to take effect July 29. Police conducting traffic stops or questioning people about possible legal violations must ask about their immigration status if they suspect they are in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 "I didn't know the (Diamondbacks) ballclub voted for it," Torre said. "Just because they have Arizona (on their jerseys) doesn't mean that those are the people you should dislike for passing this law. I don't like to tell people how to think, but I think it's sort of misguided as far as protesting that these guys are in town."\par \par \uc2 Critics say the law would unfairly target Hispanics and could lead to racial profiling. Supporters, however, say Arizona is trying to enforce immigration laws because the federal government has failed to do so.\par \par \uc2 The law has sparked protests and calls for boycotts of Arizona products, including a recent call to move next year's All-Star game from Phoenix.\par \par \uc2 "This protest is to inform the actual people going in there," said rally spokesman John Morales, who helped organize the protest with immigrant rights groups Presente.org and Boycott Arizona. "We want to make the connection that politics is very much involved in sports."\par \par \uc2 Chicago White Sox manager Ozzie Guillen said he wouldn't participate if the All-Star game remains in Arizona. The Major League Baseball Players Association have condemned the law and Rep. Jose Serrano, a New York Democrat whose district includes Yankee Stadium, also asked for the game to be moved.\par \par \uc2 Earlier this month, however, baseball commissioner Bud Selig ignored those calls and defended baseball's minority hiring record.\par \par \uc2 5\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100601e6610009f\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 TACOMA, Wash. (AP) - Paulo Sergio Alfaro-Sanchez, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  being held at a detention center in Washington state, had no idea that the federal government would count him in the census.\par \par \uc2 No one gave him a census form. No one told him his information would be culled from the center's records.\par \par \uc2 But counted he was, along with other illegal immigrants facing deportation in detention centers across the country -- about 30,000 people on any given day, according to U.S. Immigration and Customs and Enforcement.\par \par \uc2 By the time the census delivers the total tallies to the state and federal government, most of the immigrants will be long gone. But because the population snapshot determines the allocation of federal dollars, those in custody could help bring money to the towns, cities and counties in Texas, Arizona, Washington and Georgia where the country's biggest and newest facilities are located.\par \par \uc2 "I think the irony, if there's any irony, is that the locality is what's going to benefit, because you have a detention center in a particular city where people have been brought from different parts of the region, and that community will benefit," said Arturo Vargas, executive director of National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials, an organization that has pushed Latinos to participate in the census.\par \par \uc2 This census brings a twist, though. For the first time, states have the option of counting people in detention centers and prisons as residents of their last address before they're detained, worrying some local lawmakers who say cities and counties that host detention centers could lose money.\par \par \uc2 "Detention centers and prisons should probably count where they are located, that's where resources would be required," Rep. Sanford D. Bishop, D-Georgia wrote in a May letter to the chairman of the subcommittee that oversees the census. Bishop represents Stewart County, Georgia, population 4,600, where the nation's largest detention center housed a total of 14,000 people between April 2007 and March 2008.\par \par \uc2 ICE operates 22 immigrant detention centers and also houses people in hundreds of other jails or prisons. Most of the largest centers are in small towns in Texas, Arizona and Georgia. Texas is home to six detention centers, and Arizona has three.\par \par \uc2 The payout can be hefty for small towns. Federal money being distributed from the census averaged about $1,469 per person in fiscal year 2008, according to the Brookings Institution, and other grants are also available to small towns depending on their population.\par \par \uc2 In Raymondville, Texas, a town of nearly 10,000 people, the Willacy Detention Center holds an average daily population of about 1,000. The center opened in 2006 and was a boon to the community as ICE and the private company that runs the center rushed to hire personnel.\par \par \uc2 Now, the detention center's population may push Raymondville over the town's goal of surpassing 10,000, a number that will allow them to qualify for more federal help, Mayor Orlando Correa said.\par \par \uc2 "As long it's humane, as long as the facility respects the rights of these people and they're not treated like animals, I'm OK with it," Correa said.\par \par \uc2 For safety reasons, most detainees are counted through administrative records, rather than forms being passed out, U.S Census Bureau spokesman Stephen Buckner said. The census will cull data from records kept on April 1.\par \par \uc2 Alfaro-Sanchez, for his part, is glad he's being counted. He entered the country when he was about 15 through Tijuana, and worked as a handyman in Goldendale, a small town in eastern Washington.\par \par \uc2 He arrived in at the Northwest Detention Center in Tacoma on March 30 after being arrested in a fight. The charges were dropped, he said, but immigration officers had already flagged him for arrest.\par \par \uc2 "I think that even though we may be sent back, there's a lot of people who may need that money, the Hispanic people that are here," the 32-year-old said in Spanish.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100601e6610003a\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 TACOMA, Washington (AP) - Paulo Sergio Alfaro-Sanchez, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  being held at a detention center in Washington state, had no idea that the federal government would count him in the census.\par \par \uc2 No one gave him a census form. No one told him his information would be culled from the center's records.\par \par \uc2 But counted he was, along with other illegal immigrants facing deportation in detention centers across the country -- about 30,000 people on any given day, according to U.S. Immigration and Customs and Enforcement.\par \par \uc2 By the time the census delivers the total tallies to the state and federal government, most of the immigrants will be long gone. But because the population snapshot determines the allocation of federal dollars, those in custody could help bring money to the towns, cities and counties in Texas, Arizona, Washington and Georgia where the country's biggest and newest facilities are located.\par \par \uc2 "I think the irony, if there's any irony, is that the locality is what's going to benefit, because you have a detention center in a particular city where people have been brought from different parts of the region, and that community will benefit," said Arturo Vargas, executive director of National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials, an organization that has pushed Latinos to participate in the census.\par \par \uc2 This census brings a twist, though. For the first time, states have the option of counting people in detention centers and prisons as residents of their last address before they're detained, worrying some local lawmakers who say cities and counties that host detention centers could lose money.\par \par \uc2 "Detention centers and prisons should probably count where they are located, that's where resources would be required," Democratic Rep. Sanford D. Bishop wrote in a May letter to the chairman of the subcommittee that oversees the census. Bishop represents Stewart County, Georgia, population 4,600, where the country's largest detention center housed a total of 14,000 people between April 2007 and March 2008.\par \par \uc2 ICE operates 22 immigrant detention centers and also houses people in hundreds of other jails or prisons. Most of the largest centers are in small towns in Texas, Arizona and Georgia. Texas is home to six detention centers, and Arizona has three.\par \par \uc2 The payout can be hefty for small towns. Federal money being distributed from the census averaged about $1,469 per person in fiscal year 2008, according to the Brookings Institute, and other grants are also available to small towns depending on their population.\par \par \uc2 In Raymondville, Texas, a town of nearly 10,000 people, the Willacy Detention Center holds an average daily population of about 1,000. The center opened in 2006 and was a boon the community as ICE and the private company that runs the center rushed to hire personnel.\par \par \uc2 Now, the detention center's population may push Raymondville over the town's goal of surpassing 10,000, a number that will allow them to qualify for more federal help, Mayor Orlando Correa said.\par \par \uc2 "As long it's humane, as long as the facility respects the rights of these people and they're not treated like animals, I'm OK with it," Correa said.\par \par \uc2 For safety reasons, most detainees are counted through administrative records, rather than forms being passed out, U.S Census Bureau spokesman Stephen Buckner said. The census will cull data from records kept on April 1.\par \par \uc2 Alfaro-Sanchez, for his part, is glad he's being counted. He entered the country when he was about 15 through Tijuana, and worked as a handyman in Goldendale, a small town in eastern Washington.\par \par \uc2 He arrived in at the Northwest Detention Center in Tacoma on March 30 after being arrested in a fight. The charges were dropped, he said, but immigration officers had already flagged him for arrest.\par \par \uc2 "I think that even though we may be sent back, there's a lot of people who may need that money, the Hispanic people that are here," the 32-year-old said in Spanish.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100531e65v0020v\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 LOS ANGELES (AP) - Protesters planned a rally against Arizona's tough new crackdown on illegal immigration in front of Dodger Stadium during a game between the Arizona Diamondbacks and the Dodgers.\par \par \uc2 The picketers were expected to gather Monday in front of three stadium entrances. They want the Dodgers to move their spring training facility out of Arizona and for Major League Baseball to move the 2011 All-Star game out of the state.\par \par \uc2 "This protest is to inform the actual people going in there," said rally spokesman John Morales, who helped organize the protest with immigrant rights groups Presente.org and Boycott Arizona. "We want to make the connection that politics is very much involved in sports."\par \par \uc2 Arizona's new law, set to take effect July 29, requires that police conducting traffic stops or questioning people about possible legal violations ask them about their immigration status if there is "reasonable suspicion" that they're in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 Critics say it unfairly targets Hispanics and could lead to racial profiling. Supporters, however, say Arizona is trying to enforce immigration laws because the federal government has failed to do so.\par \par \uc2 The law has sparked protests and calls for boycotts of Arizona products, including a recent call to move next year's All-Star game from Phoenix.\par \par \uc2 Chicago White Sox manager Ozzie Guillen said he wouldn't participate if the game remains in Arizona. The Major League Baseball Players Association have condemned the law and Rep Jose Serrano, a New York Democrat whose district includes Yankee Stadium, also asked for the game to be moved.\par \par \uc2 Earlier this month, however, baseball commission Bud Selig ignored these calls and defended baseball's minority hiring record.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100531e65v0020i\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

Dems may nominate 1st black for governor despite lack of support from civil rights groups\b0\par\par\uc2 By PHILLIP RAWLS   \par \uc2 Associated Press Writer\par \uc2 963 \uc2 words\par \uc2 29 May 2010\par 14:24\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2010.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) - A well-funded black congressman has a shot at becoming the first African-American to win the Democratic nomination for governor of Alabama, even without the backing of the state's traditional civil rights organizations.\par \par \uc2 But a victory for Rep. Artur Davis in Tuesday's primary may be a short-lived milestone.\par \par \uc2 In a state that has gone Republican in five of the last six votes for governor, GOP candidates may draw more voters and are jostling for attention, particularly Tim James. The son of a two-term governor, James has aired blunt ads against illegal immigrants that set off fierce Internet debate and gave new momentum to his campaign.\par \par \uc2 There is no clear leader in either primary, and voter interest seems sidetracked by economic doldrums and worries over the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico that threatens Alabama shores.\par \par \uc2 Blacks make up nearly half of those who can vote in the Democratic primary, but Davis may have hurt his chances by scorning the state's four major black political groups. The four have thrown their support behind his white opponent, state Agriculture Commissioner Ron Sparks.\par \par \uc2 "I made a decision to take my case directly to African-American voters," said Davis, who skipped each group's mandatory screening process.\par \par \uc2 Davis won his congressional seat in 2002 without the groups' support, and some of them fought him again in 2008 when he led Barack Obama's successful effort to defeat Hillary Clinton in Alabama's Democratic presidential primary.\par \par \uc2 Davis said the groups no longer determine who wins black voters' support, but they still want candidates to put up large sums of money to have their names marked on ballots listing the groups' endorsements that are handed out on election day outside polling places in black areas.\par \par \uc2 The president emeritus of the Alabama New South Coalition, Hank Sanders of Selma, said racial politics is nothing new in a state where George Wallace once proclaimed "segregation forever" and served four terms as governor. But he said Davis' tactic was one he had never seen: spurning the black political group to make himself more appealing to white voters.\par \par \uc2 "The idea is to attack symbols, such as black leaders and black organizations, in a way that sends messages to white voters without alienating black voters. It's easy to miscalculate, and Artur Davis miscalculated," Sanders said.\par \par \uc2 Not all agree, with Davis picking up endorsements from the black mayors of Selma and Mobile -- along with U.S. Rep. John Lewis of Georgia, who was beaten by Alabama state troopers during a 1965 voting rights march in Selma.\par \par \uc2 "I am an Alabamian by birth, and I know what it would mean to see Artur Davis sworn in on the same steps where George Wallace stood," Lewis said.\par \par \uc2 Mae Thomas, a black auto assembly plant worker from Montgomery, said she isn't interested in what organizations throw their support behind a candidate.\par \par \uc2 "Endorsements don't matter to me. What the person has done speaks for them and the type of person they are," she said.\par \par \uc2 Thomas, who's attending college part-time, she said hasn't decided whether to vote for Davis because she likes Sparks' plan to create a state lottery to provide college scholarships.\par \par \uc2 Sparks has taken positions popular with Democrats, calling for an expansion of gambling, including a lottery, and supporting the federal health care plan. Davis, trying to claim a more centrist position to be viable in the fall, was the only member of the Congressional Black Caucus to vote against the health legislation that was opposed by many in his home state.\par \par \uc2 Leah Graves, a student at historically black Miles College in Birmingham, said she is leaning toward Davis, but she is troubled by Davis' health care vote because it stands to benefit many low-income Alabamians.\par \par \uc2 "Was it something he really believed, or was it politics?" she said.\par \par \uc2 David Lanoue, chairman of the political science department at the University of Alabama, said Davis expects African-American voters will vote for the first serious, well-funded black candidate for governor regardless of who has endorsed him.\par \par \uc2 "It's a gamble, but it's a gamble that makes a lot of sense," Lanoue said.\par \par \uc2 On the Republican side, James has received more than 800,000 hits on \uc2 YouTube\uc2  with his ad promising to end Alabama's practice of giving its written driver's exam in a dozen foreign languages. James says he will use English only.\par \par \uc2 "This is Alabama. We speak English. If you want to live here, learn it," James says in the ad.\par \par \uc2 The ad coincided with the resurgence of the immigration debate as Arizona passed a new law that makes being an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  a state crime enforced by police.\par \par \uc2 James' ad sparked a lot of discussion among the state's conservatives, including critics who said the ad is counterproductive in a state that has received substantial help from foreign businesses like Mercedes-Benz, Honda and Hyundai. However, a front-runner still has yet to emerge among the seven candidates in the party's primary race, and incumbent Gov. Bob Riley said he isn't endorsing anyone.\par \par \uc2 A runoff will be held July 13 between the top two vote-getters if no one wins a majority -- with the likely matchup being James and former two-year college chancellor Bradley Byrne. Behind them in fundraising are Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore -- known as the Ten Commandments judge for his unsuccessful fight to display a Ten Commandments monument in a state judicial building -- and state Rep. Robert Bentley of Tuscaloosa.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press Writer Jay Reeves contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100529e65t0030n\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SAN DIEGO (AP) - A U.S. health official peppered doctors with questions as he toured an often-criticized immigration detention center Wednesday, saying he left impressed by what he saw and heard.\par \par \uc2 Dr. David Rutstein, the acting deputy surgeon general, asked a pharmacist if patients quickly get uncommon psychiatric drugs, whether interpreters are available to explain how the medications work and how immigrants were evaluated for medical services when they arrived.\par \par \uc2 Rutstein said his questions reflected complaints he heard about the facility. He said he didn't learn enough to say whether critics are right but that he liked what he saw.\par \par \uc2 "I can say that the questions that I asked were professionally and correctly answered," Rutstein said in an interview after the one-hour tour. "I can say that the staff seems incredibly competent and professional. ...I can say that the physical facilities that I saw seemed top-notch."\par \par \uc2 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement typically has more than 30,000 immigrants in its custody at hundreds of facilities nationwide, usually for about a month but sometimes for years. As its detention has grown sharply in recent years, so has criticism of conditions.\par \par \uc2 The surgeon general oversees the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, which provides doctors and nurses to ICE detention centers. Rutstein said his office doesn't set broad policies at the jails.\par \par \uc2 Rutstein, who was in San Diego for a conference, said he had never toured an immigration detention center before but hopes to visit others.\par \par \uc2 The San Diego immigration jail sits amid barren hills a short distance from the Mexican border and houses about 650 mostly male detainees. It became a target of criticism from advocacy groups after an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from El Salvador was denied a biopsy for a painful lesion on his penis. Francisco Castaneda was later diagnosed with penile cancer and died in 2008 at age 36.\par \par \uc2 The American Civil Liberties Union sued ICE in 2007, alleging medical care at the detention center was inadequate. The lawsuit, which is pending in federal court in San Diego, says detainees often wait weeks or months to see a doctor or nurse and are denied necessary treatments.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100527e65r0006c\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

Senate approves tougher crackdown on illegal immigrants after poll shows voter support\b0\par\par\uc2 By STEVE LEBLANC   \par \uc2 Associated Press Writer\par \uc2 801 \uc2 words\par \uc2 27 May 2010\par 19:50\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2010.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 BOSTON (AP) - The Massachusetts Senate on Thursday approved a tougher measure designed to clamp down on illegal immigrants' ability to obtain a range of state services from Medicaid to public housing.\par \par \uc2 The 28-10 vote came a day after the Senate passed a narrower proposal targeting illegal immigrants trying to get Medicaid and unemployment benefits.\par \par \uc2 The new measure -- which is included in a budget bill working its way through the Senate -- requires companies doing business with the state to verify that their workers are in the country legally and bars them from bidding on public contracts if they're caught employing illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 It also would subject those found to have used false identification to get a job with a state contractor to a 15-year jail term or $10,000 fine. Illegal immigrants seeking state-funded public housing also would be barred from receiving those benefits ahead of anyone who is in the country legally.\par \par \uc2 Senate Republican leader Richard Tisei of Wakefield, declared it a victory for Republicans, saying it incorporates measures GOP lawmakers have long advocated.\par \par \uc2 "This sends a very strong message," he said. "You shouldn't be here illegally if you want to access benefits."\par \par \uc2 Supporters of the wide-ranging proposal couldn't say how much the various measures would end up costing taxpayers. Some suggested it would save money, but others conceded that enforcing the new rules would cost the state.\par \par \uc2 Earlier this week, Senate President Therese Murray, a Plymouth Democrat, had dismissed the Republican proposal as "smoke and mirrors."\par \par \uc2 After the vote, Murray said she was bowing to the will of the Senate, even though she didn't agree with everything in the proposal.\par \par \uc2 "There are parts of it that I think are unfortunate, but the members wanted it," said Murray, who did not cast a vote.\par \par \uc2 Democratic Sen. Steve Baddour, who spoke in favor of the proposal, called it a bipartisan compromise.\par \par \uc2 Critics, including Sen. Sonia Chang-Diaz, a Boston Democrat, faulted backers for rushing through the measure, which was unveiled Thursday minutes before senators debated and passed it.\par \par \uc2 "Shameful," Chang-Diaz said of the proposal after the vote.\par \par \uc2 In addition to restrictions on Medicaid, housing and unemployment benefits, the proposal would prevent the children of illegal immigrants from obtaining the same in-state tuition discount to public colleges and universities as legal Massachusetts residents. It also would bar \uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2  students from getting taxpayer-funded education grants.\par \par \uc2 The tuition measure is a rebuke to Gov. Deval Patrick, who has pushed to allow those students to take advantage of the lower tuition rate, arguing that many of them were brought here by their parents as small children and have attended public schools.\par \par \uc2 An aide to Patrick said the governor will ensure any new efforts "are not duplicative, too costly and overly burdensome." He added that the governor continues to back in-state tuition rates for children of illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 "It is unfair that a small number of students that did not choose to come to Massachusetts and attended public schools continue to be ineligible to pay the same tuition as their classmates," said Press Secretary Juan Martinez.\par \par \uc2 A spokesman for House Speaker Robert DeLeo said the details of any final legislation will be worked out by a House and Senate conference committee.\par \par \uc2 The proposal establishes a toll free hot line to allow citizens to report to the state Attorney General's office suspected violations of the part of the amendment prohibiting the hiring of illegal immigrants by contractors working for the state.\par \par \uc2 It also authorizes the state attorney general to enter into a "memorandum of understanding" with the U.S. attorney general to work collaboratively to enforce the nation's immigration laws.\par \par \uc2 The state also would have to verify the immigration or citizen status of anyone arraigned in a criminal proceeding before a trial court in the state. The MassHealth program also would have to check participants' immigration status through the federal Homeland Security Department.\par \par \uc2 The Massachusetts House narrowly rejected a measure last month during their budget debate that also would have required those seeking to obtain state-funded public services to verify their status.\par \par \uc2 The Senate's action follows a poll released late Wednesday that found eight out of ten Massachusetts voters say proof of citizenship should be required for public benefits.\par \par \uc2 The Suffolk University/WHDH-TV survey released Wednesday found 84 percent of voters recommending Massachusetts lawmakers require people provide proof of citizenship to receive state benefits. Just 12 percent said no and 4 percent were undecided.\par \par \uc2 The poll surveyed 500 Massachusetts registered voters from last Thursday to Sunday and had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.4 percentage points.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100527e65r00066\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

Senate OKs restrictions on \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  access to some public benefits\b0\par\par\uc2 By STEVE LEBLANC   \par \uc2 Associated Press Writer\par \uc2 458 \uc2 words\par \uc2 26 May 2010\par 19:53\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2010.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 BOSTON (AP) - The Massachusetts Senate on Wednesday passed a measure that would limit the access of illegal immigrants to some unemployment and welfare benefits, but did not go as far as Republicans would have liked.\par \par \uc2 The amendment to the state budget, which passed on a 32-6 vote, was designed to quash a more expansive Republican-sponsored measure which would have barred illegal immigrants from a wider range of benefits. One Democrat joined the Senate's Republican minority in voting against it.\par \par \uc2 A similar measure was narrowly defeated in the Massachusetts House last month.\par \par \uc2 Republicans criticized the amendment as a watered-down measure, and argued that if the federal government isn't going to do enough to enforce the nation's immigration laws, then states have to step in to fill the void with their own legislation.\par \par \uc2 The vote came amid an ongoing and sometime rancorous debate on Beacon Hill about the extent to which the state should go to discourage illegal immigrants and deny them benefits.\par \par \uc2 Senate Republicans have sponsored a series of immigrant-related amendments, including one that would require employers who contract with the state to verify that everyone working for them is in the country legally.\par \par \uc2 "It's not fair in the midst of a recession for us to be channeling dollars through employers to people who are getting employment illegally," said Sen. Bruce Tarr, R-Gloucester.\par \par \uc2 But immigrant activists painted the GOP-backed amendments as "mean-spirited" and "demonizing."\par \par \uc2 At a morning press conference, Massachusetts Immigrants and Refugee Advocacy Coalition Director Eva Millona said the GOP budget amendments contribute to an "anti-immigrant fever" in the country.\par \par \uc2 Sen. Sonia Chang-Diaz, a Boston Democrat, accused Republicans of trying to score "cheap political points" in an election year.\par \par \uc2 She called the more expansive amendment, which would have required the state to ramp up background checks on the legal status of people seeking public benefits "a multimillion campaign ad for Republicans seeking higher office."\par \par \uc2 But the criticism backfired when New England director Derrek Shulman said the some columnists, radio talk show hosts and politicians have begun to echo the language of racists, white supremacists and neo-Nazis when it comes to the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  debate.\par \par \uc2 That, he said, could eventually lead to a climate of "cultural destruction."\par \par \uc2 The comment prompted Senate President Therese Murray to issue a statement faulting Shulman and calling on him to apologize and retract his comments.\par \par \uc2 "This kind of rhetoric has no place in our conversation," Murray said. "All members have the right to debate an issue without being subjected to this kind of demonization by someone who holds an opposing view."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100526e65q001zi\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 BOSTON (AP) - Several dozen immigrant activists and students handed representatives of U.S. Sen. Scott Brown hundreds of letters in support of a bill that would give \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students a pathway to citizenship if they join the military or finish college.\par \par \uc2 The coalition, chanting "education, not deportation," and "pass the Dream Act Now," marched from the Massachusetts Statehouse and along Boston's historic Freedom Trail on Tuesday, eventually arriving at the John F. Kennedy federal building.\par \par \uc2 There, two representatives from the group known as the Student Immigrant Movement were allowed to go up to Brown's office and deliver the more than 1,500 letters of support.\par \par \uc2 Indiana Republican Sen. Richard Lugar and Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin, of Illinois, last year introduced the Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors Act in Congress. The proposal, also known as the Dream Act, would grant conditional legal status to young undocumented immigrants who successfully complete high school or the equivalent. They could qualify for permanent legal residency by graduating from college or a trade school or by joining the military within six years.\par \par \uc2 Brown, who was in Washington, has not said whether he would support the measure.\par \par \uc2 His spokeswoman Gail Gitcho said the Republican senator, who as a state senator opposed granting in-state tuition prices to illegal immigrants, would review the legislation if and when it comes before the Senate.\par \par \uc2 At the rally and march Tuesday, organizers stressed the military provision of the proposal and highlighted students who vowed to join the military if allowed.\par \par \uc2 Carlos Savio Oliveira, 22, of Falmouth, Mass., an undocumented immigrant from Brazil, said he wanted Brown to know he would join the U.S. Navy when the bill passed.\par \par \uc2 "What we want is an opportunity. That's it," said Oliveira, who was brought over to the U.S by his parents when he was 8 years old. "We're not looking for a handout. Once we get our opportunity, we can take care of ourselves."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100525e65p002jh\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.    \par \par \uc2 HOUSTON (AP) - A Pakistani student accused of conspiring to aid the Taliban and undergoing training to fight U.S. troops never intended to commit "battlefield Jihad" or help a terrorist group, his attorney told jurors Monday.\par \par \uc2 But a prosecutor said during opening statements in the trial of Adnan Babar Mirza that the student collected money for the Taliban and went through weapons training so he could fight U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan.\par \par \uc2 Mirza, 33, was one of four men arrested in 2006, accused by authorities of taking part in paramilitary training exercises at camp sites around the Houston area so they could engage in a holy war. He was indicted on nine counts, including conspiracy to help the Taliban and federal charges related to being an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  in possession of a firearm.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors said Mirza was in the country illegally because he violated his student visa by working.\par \par \uc2 If convicted, Mirza faces up to 10 years in prison. His trial was to continue through the rest of this week.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutor Jim McAlister told jurors authorities learned about what Mirza and the other men were doing when one of their friends, James Coates, decided "things were getting out of hand" and became an FBI informant.\par \par \uc2 "They were training to go overseas and fight in Afghanistan and not for the Americans," McAlister said.\par \par \uc2 David Adler, Mirza's attorney, denied his client violated his student visa by working and portrayed Mirza as a caring person who collected food for Houston's homeless and promoted Islam and Muslim culture by working with Houston police and through a public access television program.\par \par \uc2 Adler told jurors Mirza went on camping trips but denied they involved paramilitary training exercises. He accused Coates of being the one who was militant and promoted violence.\par \par \uc2 An undercover officer taped conversations with Mirza and the other men in which they allegedly talked about ambushing U.S. soldiers and triggering a bomb with a cell phone, according to court documents.\par \par \uc2 FBI Special Agent John McKinley, the prosecution's first witness, told jurors Mirza can be heard on the taped conversations talking about sending money to support Taliban families. Prosecutors have said Mirza collected about $900 for Taliban fighters and their families.\par \par \uc2 But Adler said it's not against the law to send money to the families of Taliban fighters and Mirza collected money for hospitals and other groups but not specifically for the Taliban.\par \par \uc2 He also said Mirza can be heard in these taped conversations expressing anger about injustices Muslims around the world have experienced, but his client was just expressing emotion and didn't intend to act on it.\par \par \uc2 The three other men who were arrested have pleaded guilty or been convicted.\par \par \uc2 Kobie Diallo Williams, a U.S. citizen, was sentenced in August to 4 1/2 years in prison for conspiring to join the Taliban and fight against U.S. forces.\par \par \uc2 Syed Maaz Shah, a former Pakistani engineering student at the University of Texas at Dallas, was sentenced in 2007 to 6 1/2 years in prison on federal firearms charges. Shiraz Syed Qazi, also a Pakistani student and Mirza's cousin, received a 10-month prison sentence in 2007 on a firearms charge.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100524e65o0024t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - The first defendant to be tried for a triple schoolyard killing that jolted New Jersey's largest city into trying to fix its crime problem was convicted on all counts Monday.\par \par \uc2 Rodolfo Godinez, a legal Nicaraguan immigrant who was one of six men and boys charged with the August 2007 slayings, was convicted on all 17 counts. A jury returned the verdict in state Superior Court after nearly four hours of deliberation.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors sought to portray Godinez as a ranking member of the MS-13 street gang who orchestrated the killings of Dashon Harvey, Terrance Aeriel and Iofemi Hightower as a test for an aspiring member. The murders spurred a wave of anti-crime measures in Newark, from jump-starting a surveillance camera project to expanding access to gun-trace data.\par \par \uc2 A fourth victim survived the attack and testified against Godinez. She is not being identified by The Associated Press because of sexual assault charges against two other defendants.\par \par \uc2 All four victims were enrolled or about to be enrolled at Delaware State University.\par \par \uc2 Their family members wept and rubbed one another's backs quietly as the verdict was read. Earlier, when it was announced the jury had reached a verdict, several of them gasped and started clapping. The judge warned the gallery to stay calm once the verdict was read.\par \par \uc2 "For us to see him (Godinez) every day, coming into court with a simple smirk on his face, and to find out that we have the last laugh ... it's truly been a blessing and a healing process for us," Dashon Harvey's father, James Harvey, said following the verdict.\par \par \uc2 The surviving victim's father said he was extremely proud of his daughter for having had the strength to testify during the trial -- adding that despite her ordeal, she had graduated college this past weekend.\par \par \uc2 Godinez's mother, who attended much of the trial, did not appear to be in the courtroom Monday.\par \par \uc2 Lawyer Roy Greenman, who represents Godinez, said he was disappointed with the jury's verdict and planned to appeal.\par \par \uc2 All six defendants are being tried separately.\par \par \uc2 Acting Essex County Prosecutor Robert Laurino said: "The verdict sends a message. We put forward our most difficult case, we won it."\par \par \uc2 Laurino added that prosecutors were "willing to go forward with the next five prosecutions, if necessary."\par \par \uc2 Without a wealth of physical evidence tying Godinez to the scene -- he left DNA on a beer bottle at the playground but wasn't tied to the gun or knife used in the attacks -- prosecutors used statements Godinez made to police and to a jailhouse acquaintance that appeared to implicate him.\par \par \uc2 The three slain victims were found slumped against a wall of the playground, each having suffered a gunshot wound to the back of the head. Hightower also was slashed with a machete.\par \par \uc2 The survivor testified last month, her first public account of what happened. She was 19 at the time of the attack and her identification of a picture of one of the suspects led to the capture of all six.\par \par \uc2 She said she and her three friends had gotten together to drive around and listen to music. While they were hanging out a playground, they were attacked by six men and boys. She described being sexually assaulted, slashed with a machete and shot in the head, but didn't identify Godinez as being present at the schoolyard.\par \par \uc2 Before deliberations, state Superior Court Judge Michael Ravin instructed jurors that, under New Jersey's accomplice-liability statute, they could find Godinez guilty of the murders even though there was no evidence presented that he pulled the trigger.\par \par \uc2 Greenman had argued his client was at the scene but didn't take part in the attacks.\par \par \uc2 Godinez will be sentenced July 8. The 26-year-old could spend the rest of his life in prison.\par \par \uc2 New Jersey Attorney General Paula Dow, who was the Essex County prosecutor at the time of the killings, called the verdict "just one of six pieces of a cold-blooded puzzle that shocked this city, this state, this nation three years ago."\par \par \uc2 The publicity surrounding the killings jump-started an effort to buy and install surveillance cameras and a gunshot-detection system in Newark's most dangerous neighborhoods.\par \par \uc2 State officials also gave police the authority to refer violent crime suspects' names to immigration authorities if they were suspected of being in the country illegally, a response to the fact that one of the suspects was free on bail for other crimes despite being an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Other changes followed, including the instituting of penalties for gun owners who fail to report lost or stolen weapons and a first-of-its-kind agreement to allow all New Jersey municipalities access to a federal gun-tracing database.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100524e65o00237\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 CHICAGO (AP) - In her police mug shot, the doe-eyed cartoon heroine with the bowl haircut has a black eye, battered lip and bloody nose.\par \par \uc2 Dora the Explorer's alleged crime? "Illegal Border Crossing Resisting Arrest."\par \par \uc2 The doctored picture, one of several circulating widely in the aftermath of Arizona's controversial new immigration law, may seem harmless, ridiculous or even tasteless.\par \par \uc2 But experts say the pictures and the rhetoric surrounding them online, in newspapers and at public rallies, reveal some Americans' attitudes about race, immigrants and where some of immigration reform debate may be headed.\par \par \uc2 "Dora is kind of like a blank screen onto which people can project their thoughts and feelings about Latinos," said Erynn Masi de Casanova, a sociology professor at the University of Cincinnati. "They feel like they can say negative things because she's only a cartoon character."\par \par \uc2 The depictions, whether through irony or protest, are being used by those who oppose and support Arizona's law. On one hand she's a likable symbol who many can relate to, and at the same time, perceived as an outsider who doesn't belong anywhere.\par \par \uc2 It's not the first time a children's character has been dragged into a serious debate.\par \par \uc2 In the late 1990s, Tinky Winky the Teletubby, a purple children's TV character with a triangle antenna -- was called out by Christian leaders for being gay. Sesame Street roommates Bert and Ernie are often involved in statements on same-sex marriage.\par \par \uc2 Both shows' producers say the characters aren't gay.\par \par \uc2 In Dora's case, especially because her image is so widely available, she's an easy target as discussion ramps up on how lawmakers should address the estimated 12 million illegal immigrants living in the United States.\par \par \uc2 For about a decade, the pint-sized Latina character has taught millions of children the English alphabet, colors and Spanish phrases on a Nickelodeon TV show and through a global empire. Her smiling cherub face is plastered on everything from backpacks to T-shirts to fruit snacks.\par \par \uc2 But since the passage of the Arizona law -- which requires authorities to question people about their immigration status if there's reason to suspect they're in the country illegally -- Dora's life and immigration status have been scrutinized and mocked.\par \par \uc2 Several websites, including The Huffington Post, have narrated Dora's mock capture by immigration authorities. One picture circulating on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  shows an ad for a TV show called "Dora the \uc2 Illegal Immigrant\uc2 ." On the \uc2 Facebook\uc2  page "Dora the Explorer is soo an \uc2 Illegal Immigrant\uc2 ," there are several images showing her sailing through the air over the U.S.-Mexican border.\par \par \uc2 Many of the Dora images assume the Latina character is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Mexico.\par \par \uc2 But that's where it gets complicated.\par \par \uc2 Representatives from Nickelodeon declined to comment on Dora's background, and her place of birth or citizenship have never been clear." She has brown skin, dark hair and some experts who have studied the show say she speaks Spanish with an American accent.\par \par \uc2 "She's always been ambiguously constructed," said Angharad Valdivia, who teaches media studies at the University of Illinois and has explored the issue. "In the U.S. the way we understand race is about putting people in categories and we're uncomfortable with people we can't put into categories."\par \par \uc2 Dora lives in an unidentified location with pyramids that suggest Mexico, but also tropical elements such as palm trees and her friends, Isa the iguana and Boots the monkey. Does that mean she's from South America or Florida?\par \par \uc2 Then there's oak trees and her fox nemesis Swiper, which are more common to the American Midwest.\par \par \uc2 The show often plays Salsa-like music, which has some roots in Cuba and is popular across Latin America.\par \par \uc2 Even the voice actresses behind Dora don't provide insight.\par \par \uc2 The original Dora voice belonged to Kathleen Herles, whose parents are from Peru. Dora is currently voiced by actress Caitlin Sanchez, a New Jersey-born teen who calls herself Cuban American; her grandparents are Cuban.\par \par \uc2 The images have been used on all sides of the immigration reform debate.\par \par \uc2 Many immigrant families, particularly Latinos, see Dora as a symbol of freedom, someone to relate to. She's a young girl with brown skin who lives in a borderless world and can travel anywhere she wants without consequence.\par \par \uc2 "It's symbolic of the way many Latinos live ambiguously in the United States," said Nicole Guidotti-Hernandez who teaches gender studies at the University of Arizona. "It's a shorthand for claiming our lives in the United States, especially for children."\par \par \uc2 At the same time, Guidotti-Hernandez says the ambiguity and negative imagery makes Dora susceptible to being used by those who support the Arizona law.\par \par \uc2 As for the mug shot, it's been around since late last year, when Debbie Groben of Sarasota, Fla. created it and entered it in a contest for the fake news site FreakingNews.com.\par \par \uc2 Since debate over the Arizona law heated up the nation's immigration debate, it's been e-mailed and texted widely and used on signs at rallies.\par \par \uc2 "My intentions were to do something funny, something and irreverent," said Groben, who said she opposes Arizona's law. "I actually like the little kid."\par \par \uc2 The issue appears to have resonated little with Dora's biggest fans, the millions of parents and their children who seem mostly unaware of the discussion encircling their beloved cartoon.\par \par \uc2 Altamise Leach, who has three children, said Dora's ethnicity and citizenship are irrelevant.\par \par \uc2 The stay-at-home mom credits the cartoon with helping teach her children team work. She even threw her 3-year-old daughter a Dora birthday party, complete with a Dora-like adventure, Dora cake and a woman who dressed up as Dora.\par \par \uc2 "We have so many diverse cultures, let's try to embrace everybody," Leach said. "She puts a smile on my daughter's face, that's all I want."\par \par \uc2 Erick Wyatt said he never thought about Dora's origins and his three children never asked.\par \par \uc2 "I just thought she was a cartoon character that spoke Spanish," the Flint, Mich., man said.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100522e65m0039i\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 CHICAGO (AP) - In her police mug shot, the doe-eyed cartoon heroine with the bowl haircut has a black eye, battered lip and bloody nose.\par \par \uc2 Dora the Explorer's alleged crime? "Illegal Border Crossing Resisting Arrest."\par \par \uc2 The doctored picture, one of several circulating widely in the aftermath of Arizona's controversial new immigration law, may seem harmless, ridiculous or even tasteless.\par \par \uc2 But experts say the pictures and the rhetoric surrounding them online, in newspapers and at public rallies, reveal some Americans' attitudes about race, immigrants and where some of immigration reform debate may be headed.\par \par \uc2 "Dora is kind of like a blank screen onto which people can project their thoughts and feelings about Latinos," said Erynn Masi de Casanova, a sociology professor at the University of Cincinnati. "They feel like they can say negative things because she's only a cartoon character."\par \par \uc2 The depictions, whether through irony or protest, are being used by those who oppose and support Arizona's law. On one hand she's a likable symbol who many can relate to, and at the same time, perceived as an outsider who doesn't belong anywhere.\par \par \uc2 It's not the first time a children's character has been dragged into a serious debate.\par \par \uc2 In the late 1990s, Tinky Winky the Teletubby, a purple children's TV character with a triangle antenna -- was called out by Christian leaders for being gay. Sesame Street roommates Bert and Ernie are often involved in statements on same-sex marriage.\par \par \uc2 Both shows' producers say the characters aren't gay.\par \par \uc2 In Dora's case, especially because her image is so widely available, she's an easy target as discussion ramps up on how lawmakers should address the estimated 12 million illegal immigrants living in the United States.\par \par \uc2 For about a decade, the pint-sized Latina character has taught millions of children the English alphabet, colors and Spanish phrases on a Nickelodeon TV show and through a global empire. Her smiling cherub face is plastered on everything from backpacks to T-shirts to fruit snacks.\par \par \uc2 But since the passage of the Arizona law -- which requires authorities to question people about their immigration status if there's reason to suspect they're in the country illegally -- Dora's life and immigration status have been scrutinized and mocked.\par \par \uc2 Several websites, including The Huffington Post, have narrated Dora's mock capture by immigration authorities. One picture circulating on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  shows an ad for a TV show called "Dora the \uc2 Illegal Immigrant\uc2 ." On the \uc2 Facebook\uc2  page "Dora the Explorer is soo an \uc2 Illegal Immigrant\uc2 ," there are several images showing her sailing through the air over the U.S.-Mexican border.\par \par \uc2 Many of the Dora images assume the Latina character is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Mexico.\par \par \uc2 But that's where it gets complicated.\par \par \uc2 Representatives from Nickelodeon declined to comment on Dora's background, and her place of birth or citizenship have never been clear." She has brown skin, dark hair and some experts who have studied the show say she speaks Spanish with an American accent.\par \par \uc2 "She's always been ambiguously constructed," said Angharad Valdivia, who teaches media studies at the University of Illinois and has explored the issue. "In the U.S. the way we understand race is about putting people in categories and we're uncomfortable with people we can't put into categories."\par \par \uc2 Dora lives in an unidentified location with pyramids that suggest Mexico, but also tropical elements such as palm trees and her friends, Isa the iguana and Boots the monkey. Does that mean she's from South America or Florida?\par \par \uc2 Then there's oak trees and her fox nemesis Swiper, which are more common to the American Midwest.\par \par \uc2 The show often plays Salsa-like music, which has some roots in Cuba and is popular across Latin America.\par \par \uc2 Even the voice actresses behind Dora don't provide insight.\par \par \uc2 The original Dora voice belonged to Kathleen Herles, whose parents are from Peru. Dora is currently voiced by actress Caitlin Sanchez, a New Jersey-born teen who calls herself Cuban American; her grandparents are Cuban.\par \par \uc2 The images have been used on all sides of the immigration reform debate.\par \par \uc2 Many immigrant families, particularly Latinos, see Dora as a symbol of freedom, someone to relate to. She's a young girl with brown skin who lives in a borderless world and can travel anywhere she wants without consequence.\par \par \uc2 "It's symbolic of the way many Latinos live ambiguously in the United States," said Nicole Guidotti-Hernandez who teaches gender studies at the University of Arizona. "It's a shorthand for claiming our lives in the United States, especially for children."\par \par \uc2 At the same time, Guidotti-Hernandez says the ambiguity and negative imagery makes Dora susceptible to being used by those who support the Arizona law.\par \par \uc2 As for the mug shot, it's been around since late last year, when Debbie Groben of Sarasota, Fla. created it and entered it in a contest for the fake news site FreakingNews.com.\par \par \uc2 Since debate over the Arizona law heated up the nation's immigration debate, it's been e-mailed and texted widely and used on signs at rallies.\par \par \uc2 "My intentions were to do something funny, something and irreverent," said Groben, who said she opposes Arizona's law. "I actually like the little kid."\par \par \uc2 The issue appears to have resonated little with Dora's biggest fans, the millions of parents and their children who seem mostly unaware of the discussion encircling their beloved cartoon.\par \par \uc2 Altamise Leach, who has three children, said Dora's ethnicity and citizenship are irrelevant.\par \par \uc2 The stay-at-home mom credits the cartoon with helping teach her children team work. She even threw her 3-year-old daughter a Dora birthday party, complete with a Dora-like adventure, Dora cake and a woman who dressed up as Dora.\par \par \uc2 "We have so many diverse cultures, let's try to embrace everybody," Leach said. "She puts a smile on my daughter's face, that's all I want."\par \par \uc2 Erick Wyatt said he never thought about Dora's origins and his three children never asked.\par \par \uc2 "I just thought she was a cartoon character that spoke Spanish," the Flint, Mich., man said.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100521e65l001qi\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) - Hispanic opponents of a bill meant to further clamp down on illegal workers in South Carolina lashed out at its sponsor Thursday in what became a rare shouting match in Senate offices.\par \par \uc2 Legislators are considering how to crack down harder on illegal workers, just two years after passing what many called one of the country's toughest anti-illegal immigration laws.\par \par \uc2 The bill discussed by a Senate subcommittee would put South Carolina in line with Arizona's controversial new law, by directing South Carolina law enforcement to try to check the legal status of people they suspect are in the country illegally. It specifies that suspicion can't be based on race, color or national origin.\par \par \uc2 The bill has almost no chance of passing this year, with just two weeks set in the session. But that didn't stop emotions from escalating.\par \par \uc2 Two Hispanic women confronted Sen. Larry Grooms after the meeting, asking him if he could tell which one was in the country illegally. He responded by doubting either was, sparking a back-and-forth argument before a TV camera.\par \par \uc2 The women argued that profiling is inhumane and that the bill is the wrong way to address illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 "My job is to protect the citizens of this state ... not to provide economic liberties for people in other countries," Grooms, R-Bonneau, shouted back. He argued that people who employ illegal immigrants cheaply are cheating the system and putting citizens out of work.\par \par \uc2 The debate got more heated after Roan Garcia-Quintana, a Cuban American who advocates anti-illegal immigration bills, said the women should go back where they came from if they don't like it here.\par \par \uc2 Neither of the women is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . One of the protesters, Ilia Rivera, of Greenville, shouted she's Puerto Rican and an Army veteran. Then she stalked off.\par \par \uc2 "Someone will stop me. I'm very sure they're going to," Rivera said about the bill. "I'm Puerto Rican and look like I'm Latino."\par \par \uc2 Ines Alvarez, also of Greenville, called the bill racist. A U.S. citizen originally from Panama, she is running as a Democrat to represent Greenville in the House, saying the Legislature needs an advocate for Hispanics. She said the push to rid the state of illegal workers will further hurt the economy.\par \par \uc2 "Nobody wants to go to the fields and pick up tomatoes or whatever," she said.\par \par \uc2 Later, Garcia-Quintana said he felt compelled to defend Grooms.\par \par \uc2 "I resent when they jump right in to the race card," he said, adding that illegal workers also "come in all shades of pale."\par \par \uc2 During the meeting, Senate President Pro Tem Glenn McConnell grilled Reggie Lloyd, Director of the State Law Enforcement Division, on why the agency hasn't negotiated an agreement with federal agencies to take on more immigration enforcement duties.\par \par \uc2 Legislators passed a law in 2008 directing SLED to enter an agreement with federal agencies -- known as a 287(g) agreement -- which trains officers in immigration enforcement and enables them to identify and detain illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Lloyd noted the agency's state funding has been cut nearly 40 percent in two years.\par \par \uc2 Illegal immigrants are arrested daily for serious crimes, he said. Arresting them for working at a chicken plant, he said, would divert the agency's scarce resources and hurt attempts to gain trust in the Latino community to fight violent crime and gangs.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100520e65k0029h\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

RODRIGUEZ   \par \uc2 Associated Press Writer\par \uc2 829 \uc2 words\par \uc2 18 May 2010\par 19:08\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2010.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 NOGALES, Mexico (AP) - The migrants walk for days through miles of mesquite scrub, running low on food and sometimes water, paying armed drug thug "guides" and dodging U.S. law enforcement officers along the way. And still they keep coming. The latest figures show that Arizona, which is about to put into effect the nation's toughest immigration law, also is the only border state where illegal crossings are on the rise.\par \par \uc2 While tightened security and daunting fences in Texas and California have made Arizona a busy crossing corridor for years, migrant smugglers now are finding new ways through the state's treacherous deserts.\par \par \uc2 Carmen Gonzalez, 27, recalled seven days and six nights of walking with her husband in the desert and being accosted by Mexican thugs with AK-47s, who demanded $100 bribes before abandoning them.\par \par \uc2 "It was so hard and so ugly," Gonzalez said at a shelter in this Mexican border town, where she, her husband and her brother were staying after being deported from Arizona. "I won't try again because we went through too much suffering in the desert."\par \par \uc2 New U.S. Border Patrol statistics show arrests on the Arizona border were up 6 percent -- by about 10,000 -- from October to April, even as apprehension of illegals dropped 9 percent overall. The agency uses arrests to gauge the flow of migrants; there are no precise figures on the number of illegal crossings.\par \par \uc2 Statistics from the Mexican side also show a rise in illegal crossings through Arizona.\par \par \uc2 Grupo Beta\uc2 , a Mexican government-sponsored group that aids migrants, helped 5,279 people from January to April in the area across the border from Douglas, Ariz., compared to 3,767 in the same period last year, said agent Carlos Oasaya.\par \par \uc2 That's the same area where Arizona rancher Robert Krentz was fatally shot in March as he surveyed his property in an all-terrain vehicle. Authorities suspect an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who was headed back to Mexico and worked as a scout for drug smugglers.\par \par \uc2 The killing helped fuel the emotion around the Arizona law, which will empower police to question and arrest anyone they suspect is in the country illegally. It takes effect in July.\par \par \uc2 Immigration is likely to be at the top of the agenda Wednesday when Mexican President Felipe Calderon visits Washington and attends a state dinner at the White House. Calderon has condemned Arizona's law; President Barack Obama has called it "misguided" and promised to begin tackling an immigration overhaul.\par \par \uc2 Supporters of the Arizona law said Tuesday that the growth in arrests at the border didn't spur its passing.\par \par \uc2 Instead, it was a series of factors, including the discovery of a growing numbers of immigrant safe houses and a rise in crime by illegal immigrants who have injured and killed police officers, said state Rep. John Kavanagh.\par \par \uc2 In the 1990s, increased enforcement and corrugated metal and chain-link fences dramatically cut illegal border crossings in California and Texas.\par \par \uc2 Overall, illegal immigration through those two states, New Mexico and Arizona has declined from nearly 1.2 million in 2005 to 541,000 last year, according to the Border Patrol. In Arizona, illegal crossings fell from 578,000 in 2005 to nearly 250,000 last year -- before the recent rise.\par \par \uc2 Immigration experts have long predicted the decline in crossings would reverse as the U.S. economy recovers.\par \par \uc2 "The fact is that as long as there remains an economic disparity between the U.S. and Mexico and other Latin American countries, enforcement and sanctions and any other measure won't stop the flow of migrants," said Charles Pope, interim director of the Trans-Border Institute at the University of San Diego.\par \par \uc2 Despite the recent spike in illegal crossings into Arizona, entering the state illegally is getting tougher.\par \par \uc2 U.S. Border Patrol drones scan for drug and migrant smugglers in the desert. Twelve-foot steel walls now separate the crossings through Nogales, south of Tucson, and Agua Prieta across from Douglas.\par \par \uc2 The desert around the hamlet of Sasabe, a smuggling way-station of a few dozen houses, is a drug trafficking corridor used by the Sinaloa cartel. Migrants and Mexican officials say heavily armed drug traffickers have been demanding fees since at least 2007 to allow migrants to pass.\par \par \uc2 Gonzalo Altamirano, a 19-year-old mechanic from the southern Mexican state of Oaxaca, jumped over a fence into Arizona from Agua Prieta.

COOPER   \par \uc2 Associated Press Writer\par \uc2 956 \uc2 words\par \uc2 17 May 2010\par 19:17\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2010.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHOENIX (AP) - Arizona's tough new law cracking down on illegal immigration is dividing police across the nation, pitting officers against their chiefs and raising questions about its potential to damage efforts to fight crime in Hispanic communities.\par \par \uc2 Two officers are challenging the law in court, while police unions that lobbied for it are defending it against criticism from police officials.\par \par \uc2 Both sides are debating how a law such as Arizona's can be enforced, without leading to racial profiling of Hispanics and without alienating residents in Hispanic neighborhoods with whom police have spent years trying to build trust.\par \par \uc2 "Before the signing of this bill, citizens would wave at me," said David Salgado, a 19-year Phoenix police officer who sued the city and the governor asking that the law be blocked. "Now they don't even want to make eye contact."\par \par \uc2 Still, police unions say, many of their officers in Arizona, the nation's busiest corridor for illegal immigration and smuggling, are tired of feeling helpless when dealing with people they believe are in the country illegally. Those officers want a tool to arrest them.\par \par \uc2 "Crime is not based upon skin color, it's based upon conduct," said Mark Spencer, president of the Phoenix Law Enforcement Association, the union representing Phoenix officers that lobbied aggressively for the law.\par \par \uc2 It requires police enforcing another law to verify a person's immigration status if there's "reasonable" suspicion they are in the U.S. illegally.\par \par \uc2 Several Arizona police chiefs and sheriffs say, as hard as officers try not to profile, enforcing the law will inevitably lead to it. They say it will end up taking time away from solving crimes in their cities and towns.\par \par \uc2 "When you get a law that leads a state down this path, where the enforcement is targeted to a particular segment of the population, it's very difficult not to profile," said Phoenix Police Chief Jack Harris, a critic of the law.\par \par \uc2 On Monday, police bosses from Maryland and Nevada condemned the law, saying that it could suck up vital resources and destroy delicate relationships with immigrant communities if implemented in their own states. There are at least nine other states considering similar legislation.\par \par \uc2 Police Chief Thomas Manger of Montgomery County, Md., in suburban Washington said he doesn't have the resources or the desire to enforce federal immigration violations by people who aren't disrupting the community.\par \par \uc2 "If they're not committing a crime here, frankly, I'm not sure how it enhances public safety to target those people for removal," he said.\par \par \uc2 Manger spoke on a conference call with the sheriff of Washoe County, Nev., and the retired police chief of Sacramento, Calif. The call was organized by the Law Enforcement Engagement Initiative, which advocates immigration reform.\par \par \uc2 Their criticism added to the chorus of opponents since the law's adoption April 23. There have been calls for boycotts, and some state and local governments have decided to stop doing business with the state in protest.\par \par \uc2 On Monday, the American Civil Liberties Union, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund filed the latest challenge to the law in federal court on behalf of labor unions and others.\par \par \uc2 The law takes effect July 29 unless blocked by the pending court challenges. Being in the country illegally would become a state crime, and Arizona residents could sue an agency or officer they feel isn't enforcing immigration laws to the fullest extent possible.\par \par \uc2 Arizona's legislation was passed in part with the lobbying muscle of the unions. An association of police chiefs tried to defeat or soften it.\par \par \uc2 Tucson police officer Martin Escobar also filed a lawsuit, arguing there's no "race-neutral" criteria for him to suspect that someone's in the country illegally. Some say it would be impossible to enforce without relying on indicators such as skin color, clothing and accent.\par \par \uc2 They worry Hispanic crime victims will be too scared to call for help, or eyewitnesses will refuse to cooperate in murder investigations.\par \par \uc2 Supporters say there are plenty of indicators other than race that suggest someone is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , including a lack of identification and conflicting statements. They say police have plenty of experience enforcing laws without relying on physical characteristics.\par \par \uc2 If officers are empowered to decide when it's appropriate to arrest or even to kill someone, they should be trusted not to profile based on race, said Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu, a supporter whose jurisdiction includes busy human and drug smuggling routes into Phoenix.\par \par \uc2 "We will do it without profiling," he said. "And any police chief or any sheriff in Arizona will not tolerate profiling based on race or national origin. That's unacceptable."\par \par \uc2 Gov. Jan Brewer insists racial profiling will not be tolerated. When she signed the bill, Brewer ordered the state's police training and licensing board to develop standards for enforcement that avoid profiling.\par \par \uc2 The board will meet Wednesday to adopt a framework for the training program, which director Lyle Mann said would include digital instruction materials for all of Arizona's 15,000 police officers.\par \par \uc2 Designing a training courses that prevents officers from using "the shortcut of race" will be difficult, said Jack McDevitt, associate dean of criminal justice at Northeastern University who studies racial profiling.\par \par \uc2 "No training you give police officers is going to change all of the officer's behavior," McDevitt said. "Unfortunately, the shortcut will be: 'What does this person look like? What kind of accent does he have? And what kind of car is he driving?'"\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100517e65h003ip\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 CLEVELAND (AP) - A U.S. immigration court has granted asylum to President Barack Obama's African aunt, allowing her to stay in the country and setting her on the road to citizenship after years of legal wrangling, her attorneys announced Monday.\par \par \uc2 The decision was made by a judge in U.S. Immigration Court in Boston and mailed out Friday. It comes three months after Kenya native Zeituni Onyango, the half-sister of Obama's late father, testified at a closed hearing in Boston.\par \par \uc2 People who seek asylum must show that they face persecution in their homeland on the basis of religion, race, nationality, political opinion or membership in a social group.\par \par \uc2 The basis for Onyango's asylum request was never made public, but her lawyer Margaret Wong said last year that Onyango first applied for asylum "due to violence in Kenya." The East African nation is fractured by cycles of electoral violence every five years.\par \par \uc2 Medical issues also could have played a role. In a November interview with The Associated Press, Onyango said she was disabled and was learning to walk again after being paralyzed from Guillain-Barre syndrome, an autoimmune disorder. At her hearing in Boston earlier this year, she arrived in a wheelchair and two doctors testified in support of her case.\par \par \uc2 Her lawyers would not comment on Onyango's medical troubles.\par \par \uc2 "She doesn't want people to feel sorry for her," said Scott Bratton, another of her attorneys.\par \par \uc2 Onyango's efforts to win asylum have lasted more than a decade, Wong said.\par \par \uc2 "She was ecstatic," Wong said at a news conference in Cleveland on Monday, describing Onyango's reaction to the news. "She was very, very happy."\par \par \uc2 Wong said the White House was not informed of the ruling. Obama spokesman Nick Shapiro said Monday that the White House had no involvement in the case at any point in the process.\par \par \uc2 Onyango didn't immediately respond to telephone messages left by The Associated Press and didn't answer her door in Boston. Two police cars were stationed outside her apartment building trying to keep reporters away.\par \par \uc2 "She really does give people hope," Wong said. "Because if someone like her who was in the spotlight, in the limelight -- and it was all negative -- could make it in our land of the law, I think other people could, too."\par \par \uc2 Onyango will now apply for a work permit, which would provide some documentation that she is permitted to stay in the country and allow her to travel again, Wong said. A year from now, she will be eligible to apply for a green card, which is given to people who are granted legal permanent residency in the U.S., Wong said. Five years after receving her green card, she can apply to become a U.S. citizen.\par \par \uc2 "There are hundreds and thousands of people like her who really need help to stay here," Wong said. "When they first come to this country, they don't know what they are doing."\par \par \uc2 The media's portrayal of Onyango in recent years has not been entirely fair, Wong said.\par \par \uc2 "She may not be photogenic, but she's very much a smart, thoughtful, regal woman," Wong said.\par \par \uc2 Onyango initially came to the U.S. in 2000 just for a visit, Wong said. Her first request for political asylum in 2002 was rejected, and she was ordered deported in 2004. But she didn't leave the country and continued to live in public housing in Boston.\par \par \uc2 Onyango's status as an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  was revealed just days before Obama was elected in November 2008. Obama said he did not know his aunt was living here illegally and believes laws covering the situation should be followed. To escape the media attention, Onyango came to Cleveland for a couple of months in 2008, where she has many friends in the city's Kenyan community, Wong said. At that time, a family member in Cleveland contacted Wong.\par \par \uc2 A judge later agreed to suspend her deportation order and reopen her asylum case.\par \par \uc2 Wong has said that Obama wasn't involved in the Boston hearing. The White House also said it was not helping Onyango with legal fees.\par \par \uc2 In his memoir, "Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance," Obama affectionately referred to Onyango as "Auntie Zeituni" and described meeting her during his 1988 trip to Kenya.\par \par \uc2 Onyango helped care for the president's half brothers and sister while living with Barack Obama Sr. in Kenya.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writer Rodrique Ngowi in Boston contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100517e65h002qv\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ATLANTA (AP) - When Jessica Colotl, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  college student, got arrested for a minor traffic violation at her suburban Atlanta campus, she became an accidental poster child for immigration reform.\par \par \uc2 On Friday, after getting arrested and released from detention for the second time in just over a month, she told reporters at a news conference she hopes her ordeal can help persuade leaders to work for an overhaul of the country's immigration laws.\par \par \uc2 "I just hope for the best and I hope that something positive comes out of this because we really need a reform to fix this messed up system," the 21-year-old told reporters inside a shopping center that caters to metro Atlanta's growing community of Hispanic immigrants. Colotl, who came close to deportation after the traffic arrest, looked overwhelmed by the crush of reporters shouting questions at her.\par \par \uc2 Colotl is among hundreds of thousands of young people who have been brought into the U.S. illegally by their parents. She was 11 when her parents crossed the border with her from Mexico. Eventually, she graduated from high school in Georgia and entered Kennesaw State University in the fall of 2006. A sorority member who dreams of becoming lawyer, she was set to graduate with a degree in political science this fall.\par \par \uc2 Her first arrest came on March 30, the day after getting pulled over by university police for a minor traffic violation. She was charged with driving without a license and impeding the flow of traffic.\par \par \uc2 Then, the Cobb County Sheriff's Office turned her over to officials with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, who sent her to a detention center in Alabama. After lobbying by Kennesaw State officials and her sorority sisters, ICE released Colotl last week. Federal officials deferred action on her case for a year, allowing her to complete her classes.\par \par \uc2 But Cobb County Sheriff Neil Warren obtained a new warrant for her arrest on Wednesday, saying she lied about her address when she was booked into jail following her initial arrest. Making a false statement to law enforcement is a felony under Georgia law.\par \par \uc2 Colotl turned herself in Friday morning and was released on $2,500 bond, according to sheriff's office records.\par \par \uc2 Her criminal defense lawyer, Chris Taylor, said Friday that his client's case is a perfect example of why U.S. immigration law needs reform.\par \par \uc2 "Jessica may not have the documents that show that she's an American citizen, but she's an American," Taylor said. "She's an American in her heart because she believes in the values of this country."\par \par \uc2 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which granted the deferral on her case last week, decided not to detain her again following Friday's arrest, the agency said in a statement.\par \par \uc2 Taylor said he believes there is no merit to the sheriff's charge that Colotl gave an incorrect address. The address she gave is a former address and her auto insurance and car registration still list it, he said. She also gave her current address to immigration officials and the sheriff's office had access to that information, he said.\par \par \uc2 Warren did not return calls Friday seeking comment and a spokeswoman for his office referred questions to a statement released Thursday. In it, the sheriff said Colotl knew she was in the country illegally and "further complicated her situation with her blatant disregard for Georgia Law by giving false information."\par \par \uc2 The deferred action on Colotl's case does not imply legal status but does authorize her to seek a work permit, ICE said.\par \par \uc2 Colotl's immigration lawyer, Charles Kuck, said he intends to seek an extension of that deferred status.\par \par \uc2 If Colotl is convicted on the felony charge of making a false statement, it will be virtually impossible to get a judge to agree to extend the deferral, Kuck said. But he said he is almost positive that the district attorney will dismiss those charges.\par \par \uc2 Cobb County District Attorney Pat Head did not immediately return a call Friday seeking comment.\par \par \uc2 Colotl is evaluating whether to return to Kennesaw State, but said she is certain she will graduate from college.\par \par \uc2 "I really believe that something positive should come out of this, probably an immigration reform or at least the DREAM Act," she said.\par \par \uc2 The DREAM Act, or Development Relief and Education for Alien Minors, would apply to illegal immigrants who arrived in the U.S. before the age of 16, have a high school diploma and have shown high moral character, among other requirements. The bill has been introduced many times in Congress but has yet to make it through.\par \par \uc2 It's unclear how many people would qualify under the most recent version of the act, which could be folded into a larger immigration reform bill or pushed on its own.\par \par \uc2 Both Taylor and Kuck are representing Colotl without charge.\par \par \uc2 Colotl and her lawyers were flanked by about a dozen representatives from civil liberties and immigrant rights groups at Friday's news conference. They called for ICE to revoke the Cobb County Sheriff's Office's participation in a program known as 287(g), which allows local law enforcement agents to help enforce federal immigration laws.\par \par \uc2 "We are calling for an immediate termination of the 287(g) agreement in Cobb County," said Azadeh Shahshahani of the American Civil Liberties Union of Georgia, adding that her office has contacted the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, and the U.S. Department of Justice, asking them to look into Cobb County's use of the program.\par \par \uc2 DHS spokesman Matt Chandler declined to comment and U.S. DOJ did not immediately return a call seeking comment late Friday.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100514e65e002g4\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Some supporters of Arizona's strict new immigration law say illegal immigrants are responsible for a lot of the state's crime. Is this true?\par \par \uc2 That's one of the questions in this edition of "Ask AP," a weekly Q&A column where AP journalists respond to readers' questions about the news.\par \par \uc2 If you have your own news-related question that you'd like to see answered by an AP reporter or editor, send it to newsquestions@ap.org, with "Ask AP" in the subject line.

Another is a set of tropical conditions that varies over decades at a time and is responsible for high-activity and low-activity eras.\par \par \uc2 "The Atlantic has been in a high-activity era since 1995," Bell says. "The previous high-activity era lasted from the mid-1930s to 1970."\par \par \uc2 Randolph E. Schmid\par \par \uc2 AP Science Writer\par \par \uc2 Washington\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 One of the reasons being given for the need for Arizona's new immigration law is that illegal immigrants commit a high percentage of the crimes in Arizona. What are the statistics for this, and compared with the country in general? Is it a valid claim?\par \par \uc2 C. Ford\par \par \uc2 Portland, Ore.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 There are no definitive studies or government reports that quantify the percentage of crime committed by illegal immigrants throughout Arizona and nationally.\par \par \uc2 Advocates on both sides of the immigration debate say attempts to do so have suffered from a lack of complete data from the government. In some cases, police agencies take the word of jailed people on whether they are in the country legally. Some police agencies track immigrant arrests, while others don't have the ability to readily check on the immigration status of those booked into jail. Four of Arizona's 15 sheriff's departments, for example, have special authorization to tap into federal databases to check on the immigration status of those arrested.\par \par \uc2 The best indicators are snapshots.\par \par \uc2 The Arizona Department of Corrections said 15 percent of the more than 40,000 people serving time in the state's prisons are illegal immigrants. The figures, though, don't include people who are convicted of misdemeanors or serve their sentences for felonies in county jails.\par \par \uc2 In Maricopa County, the state's most populous county -- where 60 percent of Arizonans live -- Sheriff Joe Arpaio said 14 to 18 percent of those booked into county jails are illegal immigrants, depending upon fluctuations in the size of the jail population.\par \par \uc2 Illegal immigrants account for 7.2 percent of the 6.3 million people who live in Arizona, according to the federal government's latest general population and \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  estimates. The Pew Hispanic Research Center estimated that illegal immigrants account for 7.9 percent of Arizona's population. Neither estimate specifies the number of illegal immigrants living in Maricopa County.\par \par \uc2 The Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for strict immigration laws, says screening efforts by some police agencies in Arizona and other states show high rates of incarceration for illegal immigrants, but adds that it's unclear if those communities are representative of the country.\par \par \uc2 The pro-immigrant Immigration Policy Center points to the latest federal crimes statistics that show Arizona's violent crime rate has fallen each year from 2005 to 2008 and its property crime rate has dropped each year from 2002 to 2008. The center also says that a century of research has shown immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than native-born Americans.\par \par \uc2 Jacques Billeaud\par \par \uc2 Associated Press Writer\par \par \uc2 Phoenix\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Is there a listing of the sportswriters, with their cities and papers that they write for, who voted for the AP NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year? In both the original vote and the revote?\par \par \uc2 Bruce Raffel\par \par \uc2 Reisterstown, Md.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Five days after Houston Texans linebacker Brian Cushing was suspended for four games for a positive drug test, a nationwide panel of 50 sports writers and broadcasters who cover the NFL voted for a second time to name him The Associated Press NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year.\par \par \uc2 He didn't receive anywhere near the 39 votes he got when the original balloting took place in January, but the 18 he got in Wednesday's revote were still enough to claim the honor.\par \par \uc2 AP has published a complete list of sports journalists who participated in the vote, with details about who they voted for and whether they changed their vote the second time around. You can find it here: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://bit.ly/apGa6H"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://bit.ly/apGa6H}}}\par \par \uc2 Cushing said Thursday that he never used any banned substances, even though he tested positive for a performance-enhancing drug.\par \par \uc2 Cushing confirmed he tested positive for HCG, a fertility drug that is on the league's banned substance list.\par \par \uc2 "The question of how it got into my body is still unclear," he said. "It's something that I'm very personally concerned about, just the fact that how it's there and what's going to determine it from happening again, and that's something we're going to have to medically investigate."\par \par \uc2 Barry Wilner\par \par \uc2 AP Football Writer\par \par \uc2 New York\par \par \uc2 and\par \par \uc2 Kristie Rieken\par \par \uc2 AP Sports Writer\par \par \uc2 Houston\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Have questions of your own?

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Some supporters of Arizona's strict new immigration law say illegal immigrants are responsible for a lot of the state's crime. Is this true?\par \par \uc2 That's one of the questions in this edition of "Ask AP," a weekly Q&A column where AP journalists respond to readers' questions about the news.\par \par \uc2 If you have your own news-related question that you'd like to see answered by an AP reporter or editor, send it to newsquestions(at)ap.org, with "Ask AP" in the subject line.

Another is a set of tropical conditions that varies over decades at a time and is responsible for high-activity and low-activity eras.\par \par \uc2 "The Atlantic has been in a high-activity era since 1995," Bell says. "The previous high-activity era lasted from the mid-1930s to 1970."\par \par \uc2 Randolph E. Schmid\par \par \uc2 AP Science Writer\par \par \uc2 Washington\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 One of the reasons being given for the need for Arizona's new immigration law is that illegal immigrants commit a high percentage of the crimes in Arizona. What are the statistics for this, and compared with the country in general? Is it a valid claim?\par \par \uc2 C. Ford\par \par \uc2 Portland, Ore.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 There are no definitive studies or government reports that quantify the percentage of crime committed by illegal immigrants throughout Arizona and nationally.\par \par \uc2 Advocates on both sides of the immigration debate say attempts to do so have suffered from a lack of complete data from the government. In some cases, police agencies take the word of jailed people on whether they are in the country legally. Some police agencies track immigrant arrests, while others don't have the ability to readily check on the immigration status of those booked into jail. Four of Arizona's 15 sheriff's departments, for example, have special authorization to tap into federal databases to check on the immigration status of those arrested.\par \par \uc2 The best indicators are snapshots.\par \par \uc2 The Arizona Department of Corrections said 15 percent of the more than 40,000 people serving time in the state's prisons are illegal immigrants. The figures, though, don't include people who are convicted of misdemeanors or serve their sentences for felonies in county jails.\par \par \uc2 In Maricopa County, the state's most populous county -- where 60 percent of Arizonans live -- Sheriff Joe Arpaio said 14 to 18 percent of those booked into county jails are illegal immigrants, depending upon fluctuations in the size of the jail population.\par \par \uc2 Illegal immigrants account for 7.2 percent of the 6.3 million people who live in Arizona, according to the federal government's latest general population and \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  estimates. The Pew Hispanic Research Center estimated that illegal immigrants account for 7.9 percent of Arizona's population. Neither estimate specifies the number of illegal immigrants living in Maricopa County.\par \par \uc2 The Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for strict immigration laws, says screening efforts by some police agencies in Arizona and other states show high rates of incarceration for illegal immigrants, but adds that it's unclear if those communities are representative of the country.\par \par \uc2 The pro-immigrant Immigration Policy Center points to the latest federal crimes statistics that show Arizona's violent crime rate has fallen each year from 2005 to 2008 and its property crime rate has dropped each year from 2002 to 2008. The center also says that a century of research has shown immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than native-born Americans.\par \par \uc2 Jacques Billeaud\par \par \uc2 Associated Press Writer\par \par \uc2 Phoenix\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Is there a listing of the sportswriters, with their cities and papers that they write for, who voted for the AP NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year? In both the original vote and the revote?\par \par \uc2 Bruce Raffel\par \par \uc2 Reisterstown, Md.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Five days after Houston Texans linebacker Brian Cushing was suspended for four games for a positive drug test, a nationwide panel of 50 sports writers and broadcasters who cover the NFL voted for a second time to name him The Associated Press NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year.\par \par \uc2 He didn't receive anywhere near the 39 votes he got when the original balloting took place in January, but the 18 he got in Wednesday's revote were still enough to claim the honor.\par \par \uc2 AP has published a complete list of sports journalists who participated in the vote, with details about who they voted for and whether they changed their vote the second time around. You can find it here: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://bit.ly/apGa6H"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://bit.ly/apGa6H}}}\par \par \uc2 Cushing said Thursday that he never used any banned substances, even though he tested positive for a performance-enhancing drug.\par \par \uc2 Cushing confirmed he tested positive for HCG, a fertility drug that is on the league's banned substance list.\par \par \uc2 "The question of how it got into my body is still unclear," he said. "It's something that I'm very personally concerned about, just the fact that how it's there and what's going to determine it from happening again, and that's something we're going to have to medically investigate."\par \par \uc2 Barry Wilner\par \par \uc2 AP Football Writer\par \par \uc2 New York\par \par \uc2 and\par \par \uc2 Kristie Rieken\par \par \uc2 AP Sports Writer\par \par \uc2 Houston\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Have questions of your own?

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) - Illegal immigrants are a boon, not a burden to the country, a resounding majority of Hispanics say, according to an Associated Press-Univision Poll that underscores sharp contrasts between the views of Hispanics and others. Most non-Hispanics say illegal immigrants are a drain on society.\par \par \uc2 In addition, most Hispanics condemn Arizona's strict new law targeting undocumented immigrants, while only 20 percent of non-Hispanics oppose it.\par \par \uc2 The survey also found some remarkably similar views between Hispanics and non-Hispanics on the complex, emotional issue of immigration, which has gained prominence this election year. About two-thirds of both groups consider illegal immigration a serious problem, only a quarter of each think the Arizona law will ease the state's troubles and the largest portion of both populations think current limits on legal immigration should be left alone.\par \par \uc2 Even so, much of the poll -- which questioned 901 Hispanic adults and was compared to a separate survey of the general population -- reads as if soundings were taken of two distinct worlds, an impression fortified by follow-up interviews.\par \par \uc2 "People are not coming to this country to do bad things, people are coming to make money for their families," said Javier Zurita, 43, a factory worker in Garfield, N.J., a U.S. citizen from Ecuador. "These people love this country, they've had sons and daughters in this country."\par \par \uc2 William Ryan, 38, a contractor from Elkridge, Md., sees things differently.\par \par \uc2 "It seems like every working \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  has four family members who don't work. And we're paying for all of them," said Ryan, who is white and non-Hispanic.\par \par \uc2 According to the poll, 74 percent of Hispanics said the country's estimated 12 million illegal immigrants mostly contribute to society. Just 35 percent of non-Hispanics agreed, with 60 percent saying illegal immigrants are largely a drain.\par \par \uc2 Some 67 percent of Hispanics said they oppose the Arizona statute. Just 20 percent of non-Hispanics oppose it, with 45 percent favoring it and 30 percent neutral. The law allows local police to demand citizenship papers from people they suspect of being here illegally and to detain them if they can't produce the documents.\par \par \uc2 "If I go to the convenience store for a gallon of milk, I don't carry those kinds of things," said Martin Ortiz, 37, a U.S.-born citizen and maintenance worker from San Diego. "I just slap on a pair of shorts. And a police officer notices me? Why should I get detained?"\par \par \uc2 Countering that viewpoint was Michael Doucet, 25, a technician from Houston who is white and non-Hispanic. He wants existing laws enforced and backs the new Arizona statute.\par \par \uc2 "Illegals are illegal," said Doucet. "It's not a problem with discrimination, it's not a problem with whites hating Hispanics, it is what it is. Most illegals are Hispanic."\par \par \uc2 Underlining the divergent reactions to the Arizona law, seven in 10 Hispanics hope their states don't enact similar statutes, more than double the non-Hispanics who feel that way.\par \par \uc2 Nearly nine in 10 Hispanics said a way should be found to help illegal immigrants already in this country become citizens, an idea that wins support from just over half of non-Hispanics. Some 62 percent of non-Hispanics -- compared with just 24 percent of Hispanics -- think being in the U.S. illegally should be considered a serious crime.\par \par \uc2 By 73 percent to 46 percent, more Hispanics than others said police crackdowns on illegal immigrants are likely to target Hispanics unfairly. About three quarters of Hispanics said they would consider it a big problem if Arizona police questioned a Hispanic who turned out to be here legally, more than double the non-Hispanics who said so.\par \par \uc2 "It's not one of these things where the Left would have you believe the Gestapo will be out there stomping down doors," said John Wagner, 60, a manager with the Department of Homeland Security from Las Cruces, N.M.\par \par \uc2 But Jackie Gallegos, 18, a high school student from El Paso, Texas, said she resented intrusions the Arizona law would allow.\par \par \uc2 "People are living here, working here, why shouldn't they have rights?" she said.\par \par \uc2 While both groups agree that illegal immigration is a serious problem, 83 percent of non-Hispanics think the federal government should be doing more about it, while 52 percent of Hispanics voice that view.\par \par \uc2 Hispanics trust Democrats more than Republicans to handle immigration, while it's the other way around for non-Hispanics. Still, only 45 percent of Hispanics approve of how President Barack Obama is dealing with the issue -- one of the few national issues where they rate his performance relatively poorly.\par \par \uc2 In other findings:\par \par \uc2 -- Almost nine in 10 Hispanics say illegal immigrants take jobs Americans don't want, compared with six in 10 non-Hispanics.\par \par \uc2 -- More than a quarter of Hispanics say they would not have had documentation proving their status had they been stopped by police the day they answered the poll, about double the rate for non-Hispanics.\par \par \uc2 -- Most Hispanics say only the federal government should enforce immigration laws, while a majority of non-Hispanics want local police involved.\par \par \uc2 The AP-Univision Poll was conducted from May 7-12 by GfK Roper Public Affairs & Media. It involved landline and cell phone interviews with 901 Hispanic adults and had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 5.3 percentage points.\par \par \uc2 The findings were compared to a separate poll of 1,002 people from the general population, also by GfK Roper. It involved cell and landline interviews conducted from May 7-11, and had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4.3 percentage points.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press Polling Director Trevor Tompson, AP News Survey Specialist Dennis Junius and AP writers Suzanne Gamboa and Christine Simmons contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 On the Net:\par \par \uc2 AP-Univision Poll: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.ap-gfkpoll.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.ap-gfkpoll.com}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100513e65d0029i\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ATLANTA (AP) - In the roughly six weeks since she was arrested for driving without a license, the case of Jessica Colotl, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  and college student in suburban Atlanta, has become a flashpoint in the immigration debate.\par \par \uc2 The Kennesaw State University senior's situation has drawn an outcry from people on both sides.\par \par \uc2 The American Civil Liberties Union, upset that she was detained under a section of immigration law it believes should be reserved for violent criminals, contacted the Department of Homeland Security on her behalf. A Republican candidate for governor this week demanded that citizenship verification be a part of the admissions process at state universities, and others are calling for the firing of Kennesaw State's president.\par \par \uc2 Though Colotl was released from federal custody last week and action on her immigration case has been deferred for a year, Cobb County Sheriff Neil Warren on Wednesday obtained a warrant for her arrest on new charges that she gave authorities a false address.\par \par \uc2 In a joint statement Thursday evening, Colotl's attorneys and groups supporting her said she had been in touch with the sheriff's office. The sheriff and a spokeswoman for his office did not immediately return messages left seeking comment Thursday evening.\par \par \uc2 The 21-year-old's parents brought her to the U.S. from Mexico more than 10 years ago. She graduated from high school in Georgia and entered Kennesaw State in the fall of 2006. A sorority member who dreams of becoming lawyer, she was set to graduate with a degree in political science this fall.\par \par \uc2 Colotl was arrested March 30, the day after getting pulled over by university police for a traffic violation. She was booked into the Cobb County Detention Center for driving without a license and impeding the flow of traffic.\par \par \uc2 The Cobb County Sheriff's Office participates in a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement program -- called 287(g) -- that allows local law enforcement agents to enforce federal immigration laws. Cobb County authorities turned the student over to ICE on April 1 and she was taken to a detention center in Alabama.\par \par \uc2 Her case got attention after about 30 members of her sorority from different universities wore their Lambda Theta Alpha gear and carried signs saying they were marching to support Colotl at an immigration rally at the state Capitol May 1.\par \par \uc2 The ACLU said it contacted DHS on her behalf and Kennesaw State said it has been "actively engaged in intervening on her behalf on several fronts."\par \par \uc2 ICE released Colotl last week and deferred action on her case for a year, allowing her to complete her classes.\par \par \uc2 "We are especially thrilled that she will be allowed to continue her studies here at KSU," Kennesaw State president Daniel Papp said in a statement after Colotl was released.\par \par \uc2 Warren said he got a new warrant for her arrest this week because Colotl gave a false address when she was booked into the jail, and making a false statement to law enforcement is a felony under Georgia law.\par \par \uc2 "Ms. Colotl knew that she was in the United States without authority to be here and voluntarily chose to operate a vehicle without a driver's license; which is a violation of Georgia law," Warren said in a statement. "She has further complicated her situation with her blatant disregard for Georgia Law by giving false information."\par \par \uc2 Colotl's criminal lawyer, Chris Taylor, said she is innocent of all charges. "It is truly sad that the authorities in Cobb have failed to use their common sense in dealing with Jessica's case," he said.\par \par \uc2 Taylor said his client gave her proper address to both Cobb County and immigration officials.\par \par \uc2 Attempts by The Associated Press to reach Colotl and her friends were unsuccessful Thursday.\par \par \uc2 Civil liberties and immigrant rights groups say that the 287(g) law shouldn't be used for people like Colotl.\par \par \uc2 "We have a very clear example in her case where we have a very promising student with great potential being caught up in this system that was meant for the most dangerous criminals," said Azadeh Shahshahani of the American Civil Liberties Union of Georgia.\par \par \uc2 The sheriff countered that he values "any tool that helps me enforce the law and remove violators from our community."\par \par \uc2 Americans for Immigration Control, a group that calls for strict enforcement of immigration reform, has called for Papp's firing.\par \par \uc2 Spokesman Phil Kent said Papp violated state policy by granting in-state tuition to an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "Our colleges must not be turned into sanctuaries for illegal immigrants who make no effort to return to their home countries and initiate the required paperwork to study here legally," he said.\par \par \uc2 Kennesaw State has said that Colotl was admitted as an in-state student because she graduated from a Georgia high school.\par \par \uc2 Charles Kuck, Colotl's immigration lawyer and a past president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, said he believes laws that prohibit illegal immigrants from receiving public benefits are meant to bar them from receiving government scholarships or grants.\par \par \uc2 "I do not believe it is illegal for them to attend college in the U.S.," he said.\par \par \uc2 U.S. Rep. Phil Gingrey, whose district includes Kennesaw, said Colotl's case demonstrates that federal immigration laws need to be strengthened.\par \par \uc2 "Jessica Colotl has undoubtedly met with success since coming to the United States," he said in a statement. "However, her successes since arriving here illegally must not influence which of our laws are applicable to her. Simply put, the law is the law and it is unfortunate that her parents put her in this position by bringing her here illegally as a child."\par \par \uc2 After hearing about Colotl's case, Republican candidate for governor Eric Johnson called on the Board of Regents, which oversees the state's university system, to make citizenship verification a part of the admissions process.\par \par \uc2 "For us to allow an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  to take a taxpayer subsidized spot in our University system away from a legal resident is wrong," said Johnson said, a former state senator.\par \par \uc2 "Simply checking a box on a form is not enough -- we should ask prospective students to provide verifiable proof of their immigration status," he added.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100513e65d001ze\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 INDIANAPOLIS (AP) - A state senator says Indiana should consider an immigration policy similar to Arizona's new law that makes it a state crime to be in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 Sen. Mike Delph, R-Carmel, told The Associated Press that he'll introduce some type of immigration legislation in Indiana if Congress and the Obama administration do not act soon on illegal immigration. Delph said he wants to see how the Arizona law plays out before determining the details of his proposal for Indiana.\par \par \uc2 "We should be watching Arizona, watching how they apply the law," Delph said.\par \par \uc2 Delph has proposed bills aimed at cracking down on illegal immigration before, but they've never won the approval from the General Assembly, where Republicans control the Senate and Democrats control the House.\par \par \uc2 About 55,000 to 85,000 illegal immigrants live in Indiana, according to 2006 estimates from the PEW Hispanic Center. Some critics of Delph's previous immigration proposals have said that Indiana's economy needs both legal and \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  workers to thrive.\par \par \uc2 The Arizona law, set to take effect July 29, makes it a state crime to be in the country illegally and directs local police to question individuals about their immigration status and demand documentation if they suspect a person is in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 Critics say the law encourages racial profiling and is unconstitutional, and several lawsuits seeking to block its implementation are pending in federal court. Several cities have urged boycotts against Arizona businesses to protest the law.\par \par \uc2 Arizona's governor has said the boycotts are misguided because the law mirrors a federal requirement that legal immigrants carry immigration papers. Delph said he believes Arizona's law is constitutional and said the boycotts are spurred by ignorance of existing federal law.\par \par \uc2 But Tony Barreda, chairman of the East Chicago-based Community Coalition for Immigrants, told The Times of Munster that protests would come to Indiana if the state enacted an Arizona-type proposal.\par \par \uc2 "To do this in Indiana where we're strapped economically, you can bet your life there will be a major movement here as far as boycotting the state itself," Barreda said.\par \par \uc2 Delph said he hopes to figure out details of his latest immigration proposal before the 2011 legislative session, which begins in January.\par \par \uc2 He wrote an opinion piece for Indiana newspapers saying both Republican and Democratic federal administrations have refused to enforce immigration laws and Congress has pandered to various ethnic groups.\par \par \uc2 "Until we have an administration and a Congress willing to take control of this situation, it will be up to the states to exercise the rights granted to them in federal law as Arizona has done," Delph wrote.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100513e65d001td\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

JOHNSON   \par \uc2 AP Medical Writer\par \uc2 580 \uc2 words\par \uc2 11 May 2010\par 17:22\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2010.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 CHICAGO (AP) - Expanding the "All Kids" health insurance program cost Illinois $70 million last year, a figure that could have been reduced if administrators had kept a sharper eye on who was getting assistance, the state auditor reported Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 "All Kids," a legacy of former Gov. Rod Blagojevich's administration, keeps paying medical claims when families don't pay their premiums, the audit said. Some claims are paid after recipients are too old for the program.\par \par \uc2 The state also loses out on federal matching money because the program classifies some legal immigrant children incorrectly as undocumented, the audit said.\par \par \uc2 The report by Auditor General William Holland couldn't determine exactly how much money could be saved with stricter management.\par \par \uc2 But the audit found Blagojevich's expansion of insurance to \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  children and children whose family income is too high for traditional government insurance was costly. The state paid $79 million last year in medical claims and families paid about $9 million in premiums, for a net cost of $70 million.\par \par \uc2 A marketing strategy for "All Kids" cost the state more than $8 million over three years, far more than an original estimate of $3 million. The audit found questionable billed hours and double-billed expenses paid to the Democratic consulting firm GMMB.\par \par \uc2 Blagojevich drew national praise in 2005 when he introduced "All Kids." Illinois was the first state to promise health insurance to all children. But foes predicted the state wouldn't be able to pay for the program and said it should be closed to higher-income families.\par \par \uc2 The children added under "All Kids" -- about 94,500 children in 2009 -- aren't eligible for federal funds, so the entire cost of the program is paid by state taxpayers. The audit, which was required by state law, looked only at that expansion.\par \par \uc2 "Costs were incurred that should not have been and other costs were incurred without adequate justification and documentation," Holland said. "In the absence of such documentation, the audit did not attempt to quantify what the state might have paid for the program had the department run it with greater accountability."\par \par \uc2 The audit found that:\par \par \uc2 --Nearly 70 percent of costs for medical services in fiscal year 2009 were for \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  children, but some of those children actually were legal immigrants who could have qualified for federal money.\par \par \uc2 --Only one pay stub is required to determine income eligibility and the program doesn't verify what families claim through state records.\par \par \uc2 --Rules require a 30-day grace period after premiums go unpaid, but the state is giving families 90 days before ending coverage. In a spot check by auditors of 20 families with unpaid premiums, the state paid nearly $11,000 on claims.\par \par \uc2 --Nearly $50,000 in claims were paid to recipients too old for the program.\par \par \uc2 Officials say they are fixing problems, including a computer glitch that allowed payments after recipients turned 19. Two state agencies involved in the program submitted responses to the audit.\par \par \uc2 Healthcare and Family Services Director Julie Hamos wrote: "I am committed to carefully reviewing the ways in which HFS can tighten up eligibility policy and procedures to assure accountability while at the same time assuring our beneficiaries are treated fairly and preserving our federal funding." Hamos, a veteran state legislator, was named HFS director last month.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 On the Net: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.auditor.illinois.gov/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.auditor.illinois.gov/}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100511e65b001wq\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc93}{\*\bkmkend toc93}\b \uc2 Ariz. border town officials say while Mexico crime flares up, only a flicker here\b0\par\par\uc2 By DENNIS WAGNER   \par \uc2 The Arizona Republic\par \uc2 1,189 \uc2 words\par \uc2 9 May 2010\par 04:00\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2010.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 NOGALES, Ariz. (AP) - Assistant Police Chief Roy Bermudez shakes his head and smiles when he hears politicians and pundits declaring that Mexican cartel violence is overrunning his Arizona border town.\par \par \uc2 "We have not, thank God, witnessed any spillover violence from Mexico," Bermudez says emphatically. "You can look at the crime stats. I think Nogales, Ariz., is one of the safest places to live in all of America."\par \par \uc2 FBI Uniform Crime Reports and statistics provided by police agencies, in fact, show that the crime rates in Nogales, Douglas, Yuma and other Arizona border towns have remained essentially flat for the past decade, even as drug-related violence has spiraled out of control on the other side of the international line. Statewide, rates of violent crime also are down.\par \par \uc2 While smugglers have become more aggressive in their encounters with authorities, as evidenced by the April 30 shooting of a Pinal County deputy, allegedly by \uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2  drug runners, they do not routinely target residents of border towns.\par \par \uc2 In 2000, there were 23 rapes, robberies and murders in Nogales, Ariz. Last year, despite nearly a decade of population growth, there were 19 such crimes. Aggravated assaults dropped by one-third. No one has been murdered in two years.\par \par \uc2 Bermudez said people unfamiliar with the border may be confused because Nogales, Sonora, has become notorious for kidnappings, shootouts and beheadings. With 500 Border Patrol agents and countless other law officers swarming the Arizona side, he said, smugglers pass through as quickly and furtively as possible.\par \par \uc2 "Everywhere you turn, there's some kind of law enforcement looking at you," Bermudez said. "Per capita, we probably have the highest amount of any city in the United States."\par \par \uc2 In Yuma, police spokesman Sgt. Clint Norred said he cannot recall any significant cartel violence in the past several years. Departmental crime records show the amount of bloodshed has remained stable despite a substantial population increase.\par \par \uc2 "It almost seems like Yuma is more of an entryway" for smugglers rather than a combat zone, he said.\par \par \uc2 Since the murder of Cochise County rancher Robert Krentz by a suspected \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  in March, politicians and the national press have fanned a perception that the border is inundated with bloodshed and that it's escalating.\par \par \uc2 Congressional members, including Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., and John Shadegg, R-Ariz., sent President Barack Obama a letter asking that National Guard soldiers be sent to the border because "violence in the vicinity of the U.S. Mexico border continues to increase at an alarming rate."\par \par \uc2 And last month, as she signed Arizona's tough new law cracking down on illegal immigrants, Gov. Jan Brewer also called for National Guard troops. The law makes it a state crime to be in Arizona illegally and requires authorities to check documents of people they reasonably suspect to be illegal. Brewer said she signed it to solve what she said is an Arizona "crisis" caused by "border-related violence and crime due to illegal immigration."\par \par \uc2 Clarence Dupnik, the sheriff of Pima County, said there always has been crime associated with smuggling in southern Arizona, but today's rhetoric does not seem to jibe with reality.\par \par \uc2 "This is a media-created event," Dupnik said. "I hear politicians on TV saying the border has gotten worse. Well, the fact of the matter is that the border has never been more secure."\par \par \uc2 Even Cochise County Sheriff Larry Dever, among the most strident critics of federal enforcement, concedes that notions of cartel mayhem are exaggerated.\par \par \uc2 "We're not seeing the multiple killings, beheadings and shootouts that are going on on the other side," he said.\par \par \uc2 In fact, according to the Border Patrol, Krentz is the only American murdered by a suspected \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  in at least a decade within the agency's Tucson sector, the busiest smuggling route among the Border Patrol's nine coverage regions along the U.S.-Mexican border.\par \par \uc2 Still, Dever said, the slaying proved useful to southern Arizonans who are sick of smugglers and immigrants tramping through their lands.\par \par \uc2 "The interest just elevated. And we keep the pressure on because next week something else is going to happen, and the window of opportunity will close," Dever said.\par \par \uc2 Cochise County's crime rate has been "flat" for at least 10 years, the sheriff added. Even in 2000, when record numbers of undocumented immigrants were detained in the area, just 4 percent of the area's violent crimes were committed by illegal aliens.\par \par \uc2 While the nation's \uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2  population doubled from 1994 to 2004, according to federal records, the violent-crime rate declined 35 percent.\par \par \uc2 More recently, Arizona's violent-crime rate dropped from 512 incidents per 100,000 residents in 2005 to 447 incidents in 2008, the most recent year for which data is available.\par \par \uc2 In testimony to the Senate Committee on Homeland Security last month, Dennis Burke, U.S. attorney for Arizona, noted that Arizona now has more than 6,000 federal law-enforcement agents, with the majority of them employed by the Border Patrol. That represents nearly 10 agents for every mile of international line between Arizona and Sonora.\par \par \uc2 Border Patrol presence has been backed by increases in counter-smuggling technology and intelligence, the establishment of permanent highway checkpoints and a dramatic increase in customs inspectors at U.S. ports.\par \par \uc2 Given that level of security, Bermudez and others say, it is no wonder that cartel operatives pass through border communities as quickly as possible, avoiding conflicts and attention.\par \par \uc2 In fact, violent-crime data suggest that violence from Mexico leapfrogs the border to smuggling hubs and destinations, where cartel members do take part in murders, home invasions and kidnappings.\par \par \uc2 During a national border security expo in Phoenix last week, David Aguilar, acting deputy commissioner for Customs and Border Protection, said policy makers and the public need to understand that the border is not a fence or a line in the dirt but a broad and complex corridor.\par \par \uc2 "It is," Aguilar explained, "a third country that joins Mexico and the United States."\par \par \uc2 He emphasized that the cartels operate throughout Mexico and the United States, and he noted that those who think of border security in terms of a "juridical line" really don't understand the dynamics.\par \par \uc2 In Nogales, Ariz., residents seem bemused and annoyed by their town's perilous reputation. Yes, they sometimes hear the gunfire across the border. No, they don't feel safe visiting the sister city across the line. But with cops and federal agents everywhere, they see no danger on their streets.\par \par \uc2 "There's no violence here," said Francisco Hernandez, 31, who works in a sign shop and lives on a ranch along the border. "It doesn't drain over, like people are saying."\par \par \uc2 Leo Federico, 61, a retired teacher, said he has been amazed to hear members of Congress call for National Guard troops in the area.\par \par \uc2 "That's politics," he said, shrugging. "It's all about votes. ... We have plenty of law enforcement."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Information from: The Arizona Republic, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.azcentral.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.azcentral.com}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100509e659001mh\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 NOGALES, Ariz. (AP) - Assistant Police Chief Roy Bermudez shakes his head and smiles when he hears politicians and pundits declaring that Mexican cartel violence is overrunning his Arizona border town.\par \par \uc2 "We have not, thank God, witnessed any spillover violence from Mexico," Bermudez says emphatically. "You can look at the crime stats. I think Nogales, Ariz., is one of the safest places to live in all of America."\par \par \uc2 FBI Uniform Crime Reports and statistics provided by police agencies, in fact, show that the crime rates in Nogales, Douglas, Yuma and other Arizona border towns have remained essentially flat for the past decade, even as drug-related violence has spiraled out of control on the other side of the international line. Statewide, rates of violent crime also are down.\par \par \uc2 While smugglers have become more aggressive in their encounters with authorities, as evidenced by the April 30 shooting of a Pinal County deputy, allegedly by \uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2  drug runners, they do not routinely target residents of border towns.\par \par \uc2 In 2000, there were 23 rapes, robberies and murders in Nogales, Ariz. Last year, despite nearly a decade of population growth, there were 19 such crimes. Aggravated assaults dropped by one-third. No one has been murdered in two years.\par \par \uc2 Bermudez said people unfamiliar with the border may be confused because Nogales, Sonora, has become notorious for kidnappings, shootouts and beheadings. With 500 Border Patrol agents and countless other law officers swarming the Arizona side, he said, smugglers pass through as quickly and furtively as possible.\par \par \uc2 "Everywhere you turn, there's some kind of law enforcement looking at you," Bermudez said. "Per capita, we probably have the highest amount of any city in the United States."\par \par \uc2 In Yuma, police spokesman Sgt. Clint Norred said he cannot recall any significant cartel violence in the past several years. Departmental crime records show the amount of bloodshed has remained stable despite a substantial population increase.\par \par \uc2 "It almost seems like Yuma is more of an entryway" for smugglers rather than a combat zone, he said.\par \par \uc2 Since the murder of Cochise County rancher Robert Krentz by a suspected \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  in March, politicians and the national press have fanned a perception that the border is inundated with bloodshed and that it's escalating.\par \par \uc2 Congressional members, including Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., and John Shadegg, R-Ariz., sent President Barack Obama a letter asking that National Guard soldiers be sent to the border because "violence in the vicinity of the U.S. Mexico border continues to increase at an alarming rate."\par \par \uc2 And last month, as she signed Arizona's tough new law cracking down on illegal immigrants, Gov. Jan Brewer also called for National Guard troops. The law makes it a state crime to be in Arizona illegally and requires authorities to check documents of people they reasonably suspect to be illegal. Brewer said she signed it to solve what she said is an Arizona "crisis" caused by "border-related violence and crime due to illegal immigration."\par \par \uc2 Clarence Dupnik, the sheriff of Pima County, said there always has been crime associated with smuggling in southern Arizona, but today's rhetoric does not seem to jibe with reality.\par \par \uc2 "This is a media-created event," Dupnik said. "I hear politicians on TV saying the border has gotten worse. Well, the fact of the matter is that the border has never been more secure."\par \par \uc2 Even Cochise County Sheriff Larry Dever, among the most strident critics of federal enforcement, concedes that notions of cartel mayhem are exaggerated.\par \par \uc2 "We're not seeing the multiple killings, beheadings and shootouts that are going on on the other side," he said.\par \par \uc2 In fact, according to the Border Patrol, Krentz is the only American murdered by a suspected \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  in at least a decade within the agency's Tucson sector, the busiest smuggling route among the Border Patrol's nine coverage regions along the U.S.-Mexican border.\par \par \uc2 Still, Dever said, the slaying proved useful to southern Arizonans who are sick of smugglers and immigrants tramping through their lands.\par \par \uc2 "The interest just elevated. And we keep the pressure on because next week something else is going to happen, and the window of opportunity will close," Dever said.\par \par \uc2 Cochise County's crime rate has been "flat" for at least 10 years, the sheriff added. Even in 2000, when record numbers of undocumented immigrants were detained in the area, just 4 percent of the area's violent crimes were committed by illegal aliens.\par \par \uc2 While the nation's \uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2  population doubled from 1994 to 2004, according to federal records, the violent-crime rate declined 35 percent.\par \par \uc2 More recently, Arizona's violent-crime rate dropped from 512 incidents per 100,000 residents in 2005 to 447 incidents in 2008, the most recent year for which data is available.\par \par \uc2 In testimony to the Senate Committee on Homeland Security last month, Dennis Burke, U.S. attorney for Arizona, noted that Arizona now has more than 6,000 federal law-enforcement agents, with the majority of them employed by the Border Patrol. That represents nearly 10 agents for every mile of international line between Arizona and Sonora.\par \par \uc2 Border Patrol presence has been backed by increases in counter-smuggling technology and intelligence, the establishment of permanent highway checkpoints and a dramatic increase in customs inspectors at U.S. ports.\par \par \uc2 Given that level of security, Bermudez and others say, it is no wonder that cartel operatives pass through border communities as quickly as possible, avoiding conflicts and attention.\par \par \uc2 In fact, violent-crime data suggest that violence from Mexico leapfrogs the border to smuggling hubs and destinations, where cartel members do take part in murders, home invasions and kidnappings.\par \par \uc2 During a national border security expo in Phoenix last week, David Aguilar, acting deputy commissioner for Customs and Border Protection, said policy makers and the public need to understand that the border is not a fence or a line in the dirt but a broad and complex corridor.\par \par \uc2 "It is," Aguilar explained, "a third country that joins Mexico and the United States."\par \par \uc2 He emphasized that the cartels operate throughout Mexico and the United States, and he noted that those who think of border security in terms of a "juridical line" really don't understand the dynamics.\par \par \uc2 In Nogales, Ariz., residents seem bemused and annoyed by their town's perilous reputation. Yes, they sometimes hear the gunfire across the border. No, they don't feel safe visiting the sister city across the line. But with cops and federal agents everywhere, they see no danger on their streets.\par \par \uc2 "There's no violence here," said Francisco Hernandez, 31, who works in a sign shop and lives on a ranch along the border. "It doesn't drain over, like people are saying."\par \par \uc2 Leo Federico, 61, a retired teacher, said he has been amazed to hear members of Congress call for National Guard troops in the area.\par \par \uc2 "That's politics," he said, shrugging. "It's all about votes. ... We have plenty of law enforcement."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Information from: The Arizona Republic, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.azcentral.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.azcentral.com}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100508e658001e9\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

(AP) - A Connecticut man repeatedly raped his live-in girlfriend, attacked her with a machete and called her his slave after paying for her move to the United States from her native Guatemala, according to an arrest affidavit.\par \par \uc2 Twenty-four-year-old Edy Augusto Marroquin of Norwalk was charged with first-degree sexual assault Wednesday, as he appeared in Norwalk Superior Court in a separate domestic violence case involving the woman.\par \par \uc2 The woman told authorities she was raped one to two times per week and tortured during a one-year period after moving to the U.S. in December 2008.\par \par \uc2 Authorities say in one incident, the woman said Marroquin hit her with a machete and threatened to "cut off her head and feed it to the dogs."\par \par \uc2 The woman was treated for her injuries at Norwalk Hospital. Telephone messages were left for police and prosecutors.\par \par \uc2 Marroquin is being held on $100,000 bail and is due back in court June 9. Messages were left Thursday with his public defender.\par \par \uc2 The woman told police everything was fine until Christmas Eve when Marroquin pulled her by the hair and struck her on the face, according to the arrest affidavit. She said he threw her to the floor, put his knees on her chest, causing her extreme pain, and told her she was a dog and his slave.\par \par \uc2 Marroquin then put on a pornographic movie and raped the woman, police said. He allegedly told her to sleep on the floor because she was a dog and that police would not believe her because she was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Marroquin also threatened to kill the woman if she told anyone, the affidavit states.\par \par \uc2 In February 2009, Marroquin came home drunk, tied the woman's hands up and stuffed a rag in her mouth, police said. He raped her and put on loud music to drown out her attempts to scream, according to the affidavit.\par \par \uc2 In December, Marroquin grabbed the woman by her hair and lifted her up from the floor asking where his keys were, police said. When she said she didn't know, he grabbed the machete and struck her with the flat side of the blade across her back, police said.\par \par \uc2 The woman said the machete attack was the final straw, and she finally mustered the courage to go to the police.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100506e656002jj\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

Sen. candidate Rubio now approves of Ariz. immigration law after minor changes\b0\par\par\uc2 By BRENDAN FARRINGTON   \par \uc2 AP Political Writer\par \uc2 613 \uc2 words\par \uc2 6 May 2010\par 19:26\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2010.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) - Florida's Republican Senate candidate Marco Rubio is supporting a controversial new Arizona immigration law, saying Thursday he changed his position after lawmakers tweaked language in a way that critics say makes it even more harsh.\par \par \uc2 Rubio, the likely GOP nominee, had said Arizona lawmakers went too far when they passed the law that requires state and local law officers to question people about their immigration status if there's reason to suspect they're in the country illegally. It also makes it a state crime to be in the United States illegally.\par \par \uc2 But Rubio said he's comfortable with the law since the language was amended in an effort to quell widespread criticism, saying the changes addressed concerns he had about potential abuse.\par \par \uc2 The new language bans racial profiling and more clearly defines when an officer can question a person's immigration status, but still doesn't define what should make an officer suspect someone might be an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The new language also allows officials to question a person's immigration status when they are enforcing civil ordinances, such as playing music too loud or not keeping the lawn trimmed, thus expanding the number of situations in which officers would be required to check immigration status.\par \par \uc2 "Having visited Arizona recently, it was clear to me that concerns about public safety prompted passage of this law. Since the original law was signed, I believe important changes have been made that address my original concerns and those of many," he said Thursday through a spokesman.\par \par \uc2 Rubio is in a three-way race for the U.S. senate seat, facing Republican Gov. Charlie Crist, who is running as an independent, and U.S. Rep. Kendrick Meek, the Democratic front-runner. A Mason-Dixon poll released Thursday showed the governor in the lead, with Crist favored by 38 percent of the respondents, compared to 32 percent support for Rubio and 19 percent for Meek. Crist was drawing most of his support from Democratic voters.\par \par \uc2 Crist said his opinion on the Arizona law remains unchanged despite the amended language.\par \par \uc2 "It still disturbs me greatly," Crist said, adding that he is uncomfortable with allowing wide latitude for officers to determine who is or isn't suspected of being an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . "That kind of imprecision in law is dangerous."\par \par \uc2 "As a grandson of a Greek immigrant, I'm very disappointed in what's happening in Arizona and I don't think it's representative of what Americans want or embrace," Crist said in a phone interview.\par \par \uc2 Meek's campaign didn't comment on Rubio's new position. Meek, a former state trooper, has said the law encourages police to question people who have done nothing wrong and will make it harder to get people who are witnesses to crimes to cooperate with law enforcement.\par \par \uc2 Rubio said he understands why the state is trying to get a grip on the problem of illegal immigration and should have the right to do so.\par \par \uc2 "While this law addresses Arizona's challenges, I believe the best approach to border security and illegal immigration is for the federal government to tackle this issue without granting amnesty," said Rubio, a son of Cuban immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Arizona Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, a Democrat, said she hasn't heard of anyone else who had opposed the bill now saying they support it.\par \par \uc2 She argued the recent changes expand police authority and won't stop racial profiling.\par \par \uc2 "The changes to the bill make the bill worse," Sinema said. "Maybe Mr. Rubio didn't read it."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100506e6560008j\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

One of the bill's 10 co-sponsors, Justin Pulliam, said, "This isn't a financial issue. This is about what's right and what's fair. It isn't fair to out-of-state citizens who are here legally."\par \par \uc2 But according to student senator Taylor Barron, "This is an immigration issue. It does not belong in the student senate."\par \par \uc2 Illegal-immigrant\uc2  residents of Texas have qualified for in-state tuition at state universities under a 2001 Texas law.\par \par \uc2
