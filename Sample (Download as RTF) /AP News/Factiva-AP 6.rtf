The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ATLANTA (AP) - Viridiana Martinez has been on the front lines in the debate over immigration reform, organizing protests and getting arrested in acts of civil disobedience. But when the president announced a policy allowing young people like her to temporarily avoid deportation, she was anything but elated.\par \par \uc2 "It's all political theater," said the 26-year-old who came to the U.S. illegally from Mexico when she was 6 and grew up in North Carolina. "For me, at this point, applying for deferred action would be like accepting that theater, and I can't do that."\par \par \uc2 The lukewarm responses of Martinez and other leaders of the so-called DREAMers movement come after they have spent months or even years traveling the country while openly declaring themselves "undocumented and unafraid." They have gotten themselves arrested, boldly given interviews to the press and allowed their pictures to be taken, and many are known to immigration authorities, who have taken no steps to deport them.\par \par \uc2 The policy shift announced by President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  in June provides a two-year protection from deportation to certain young people brought to this country illegally and the chance to apply for a work permit. Now the young activist leaders are deciding whether it's worth accepting a deal that falls far short of what they're asking for.\par \par \uc2 Some, like Martinez, are rejecting the program because its narrow scope doesn't provide a path to legalization or any security for their families. But others have decided to apply despite misgivings, lured by the chance to get a driver's license and qualify for in-state tuition in some states and to get a work permit.\par \par \uc2 Keish Kim, brought from Korea when she was 8, has been a vocal and active critic of a policy that effectively bars students who can't prove their citizenship or legal residency from attending Georgia's most competitive state colleges and universities. She's skeptical of the new program, but decided to apply.\par \par \uc2 "If I do get deferred action, I can legally work and help sustain my family financially," said the 21-year-old Syracuse University student. "That means a lot to a lot of undocumented families."\par \par \uc2 The government began accepting applications Aug. 15. The \uc2 Migration Policy Institute\uc2  estimates that as many as 1.7 million people could be eligible. By Oct. 10, about 180,000 people had applied and nearly 4,600 applications had been approved.\par \par \uc2 Throngs of young people have turned out at events nationwide where immigration lawyers have offered free guidance on completing applications. Still, some are concerned about signaling their presence to immigration authorities. And there are other obstacles: the $465 application fee and the extensive documentation required to prove eligibility.\par \par \uc2 Mohammad Abdollahi, 27, who grew up in Michigan after being brought here illegally from Iran at age 3, said he is concerned about applicants who might get rejected. The leader of many protests around the country said he doesn't plan to apply until the guidelines are more inclusive.\par \par \uc2 "Getting a work permit would help me," he said. "But I know there are so many other people who are not out and are not organizing that are not going to qualify or their applications are going to get rejected."\par \par \uc2 Many critics say the policy -- which they contend falls short even as a stopgap measure -- is a way for Obama to pander to the growing Latino voting bloc ahead of the elections.\par \par \uc2 "He got away with making it seem like he became our friend," Martinez said of the president. "I'm not going to drink the Kool-Aid."\par \par \uc2 Martinez has been arrested during civil disobedience actions in Atlanta and Charlotte, N.C., and recently purposely got herself detained in a federal immigration detention center in south Florida to gather stories of others locked up and to try to help win their release.\par \par \uc2 She is not applying out of principle, but recognizes her high profile may give her more protection from deportation than others. Her sister, who lives in a small town in North Carolina, has applied for the program to gain work authorization.\par \par \uc2 To be eligible, applicants have to prove that they arrived in the U.S. before they turned 16 and are under 30 years old. They must be high school graduates or in school, or have served in the military, and they cannot have a serious criminal record.\par \par \uc2 The requirements are similar to those of the failed DREAM Act, which would have provided a path to legal residency for many brought here illegally as children. The new policy does not provide legal status, and both protection from deportation and work authorization is only for two years.\par \par \uc2 Last spring, groups of young activists staged sit-ins at Obama campaign offices around the country and gathered signatures asking the president to issue an executive order halting deportations for anyone who would be eligible for the DREAM Act had it passed.\par \par \uc2 Some believe confusion about the new policy has ended up giving more credit to Obama than he deserves, and that more comprehensive reform may be shelved.\par \par \uc2 "I'm just afraid that people will push aside immigration as if it was addressed," said Kim.\par \par \uc2 The program is not an executive order, but rather a policy directive that will those who are approved in a state of limbo. They will also not be eligible for certain benefits that legal immigrants and American citizens can access.\par \par \uc2 For some, the cost is an issue.\par \par \uc2 Georgina Perez, a 23-year-old full-time college student with no job, wants a work permit, but she can't afford the $465 application fee.\par \par \uc2 "I was very cautious (when the policy was announced). I didn't celebrate it right away," said Perez, who came from Mexico when she was two and has helped lead immigration protests in Georgia and got arrested during a civil disobedience action last year. "Now I see that I should go ahead and apply for it, but there's another roadblock, the money."\par \par \uc2 Though many who have devoted themselves to advocating for the DREAM Act are disappointed, they see the president's program as proof that the movement is having an impact.\par \par \uc2 "This just showed the power that we have and the power of organizing to create some sort of change," said Maria Marroquin, 25, a pre-law student at \uc2 Dominican University\uc2  near Chicago who came to the U.S. illegally from Peru when she was 13.\par \par \uc2 Marroquin founded Dream Activist Pennsylvania in 2009 and was one of seven young people arrested when they sat down in a downtown Atlanta street in April 2011 as an act of civil disobedience.\par \par \uc2 She applied for the president's program last month.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Follow Brumback at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.twitter.com/katebrumback"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.twitter.com/katebrumback}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020121027e8ar002s3\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

CALDWELL   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 642 \uc2 words\par \uc2 23 October 2012\par 15:14\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2012.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The issue:\par \par \uc2 Illegal immigration is a decades-old problem. With an estimated 11.5 million illegal immigrants living, and in many cases working, in the U.S. the question remains: What do we do with them? And how do we stop more people from coming? Lax enforcement potentially leads to more illegal immigrants competing with U.S. citizens for jobs and some social services. But a too-tight policy could mean farmers and others in industries that rely on the cheaper labor of illegal immigrants are left begging for workers, passing higher costs on to consumers or going out of business altogether.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Where they stand:\par \par \uc2 President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  has pushed for the DREAM Act, a path to citizenship for many young illegal immigrants who arrived in the U.S. as children. Efforts to pass the bill have repeatedly failed, most notably in 2010 when it stalled in a Democratic-led Senate. In June, Obama announced a plan to delay deportations for many illegal immigrants who would have benefited from the DREAM Act for up to two years and let them get work permits.\par \par \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2  has said that as president he would veto the DREAM Act should it ever cross his desk, though during the second presidential debate he said he supports a path to legal status for young illegal immigrants. He would honor any work permits issued under Obama's plan to delay deportations for many young illegal immigrants but wouldn't accept new applications for the program. Romney favors completing a towering steel fence along the Mexican border, in addition to the 650 miles already constructed, and opposes letting \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students pay in-state tuition at state universities.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Why it matters:\par \par \uc2 Illegal immigration has slowed in recent years, with the Border Patrol recently recording the fewest arrests in almost 40 years. But many people worry that the Mexican border, the most popular crossing point for newly arriving illegal immigrants, still isn't secure more than a decade after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.\par \par \uc2 In the last several years, the government has spent billions building a fence, doubling the number of Border Patrol agents and adding a slew of high-tech gadgets to stop illegal immigrants. The numbers tell a compelling story: In the 2011 budget year, the Border Patrol arrested about 327,000 people at the Mexican border. In 2006, agents made more than 1 million such arrests.\par \par \uc2 Obama's administration also deported a record number of people last year, nearly 400,000. The government has been shifting its focus to finding and deporting criminal immigrants and those who otherwise pose a security threat.\par \par \uc2 There's room for debate about what has led to the steep drop in arrests; it's quite clear the struggling economy has made it less attractive to enter the U.S. Still, Republicans insist any illegal crossings are too many. And there's broad agreement that the border should be more secure.\par \par \uc2 As for illegal immigrants already in the country, there's no easy answer.\par \par \uc2 In 1986, under President Ronald Reagan, Congress approved an amnesty that granted millions of immigrants legal status while prohibiting the hiring of illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Hiring has continued in many sectors, notably farming. And some lawmakers worry that agriculture would sink if there were an aggressive effort to verify that all farmworkers could legally work in the U.S.\par \par \uc2 Various overhauls of immigration policy have been proposed since the early 2000s. But the debate often boils down to Republicans wanting the border secure before anything else, and Democrats pushing for that security and for a path to legalization at once. The result has been a legislative stalemate.\par \par \uc2 ----\par \par \uc2 Follow Alicia A.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WICHITA, Kan. (AP) - When Candida L. Gutierrez's identity was stolen, the thief didn't limit herself to opening fraudulent credit and bank accounts. She assumed Gutierrez's persona completely, using it to get a job, a driver's license, a mortgage and even medical care for the birth of two children.\par \par \uc2 All the while, the crook claimed the real Gutierrez was the one who had stolen her identity. The women's unusual tug-of-war puts a face on "total identity theft," a brazen form of the crime in which con artists go beyond financial fraud to assume many other aspects of another person's life.\par \par \uc2 The scheme has been linked to illegal immigrants who use stolen Social Security numbers to get paid at their jobs, and authorities fear the problem could soon grow to ensnare more unsuspecting Americans.\par \par \uc2 "When she claimed my identity and I claimed it back, she was informed that I was claiming it too," said Gutierrez, a 31-year-old Houston elementary school teacher. "She knew I was aware and that I was trying to fight, and yet she would keep fighting. It is not like she realized and she stopped. No, she kept going, and she kept going harder."\par \par \uc2 A 32-year-old \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  named Benita Cardona-Gonzalez is accused of using Gutierrez's identity during a 10-year period when she worked at a Topeka company that packages refrigerated foods.\par \par \uc2 For years, large numbers of illegal immigrants have filled out payroll forms using their real names but stolen Social Security numbers. However, as electronic employment verification systems such as E-Verify become more common, the use of fake numbers is increasingly difficult. Now prosecutors worry that more people will try to fool the systems by assuming full identities rather than stealing the numbers alone.\par \par \uc2 For victims, total identity theft can also have serious health consequences if electronic medical records linked to Social Security numbers get mixed up, putting at risk the accuracy of important patient information such as blood types or life-threatening allergies.\par \par \uc2 Federal Trade Commission\uc2  statistics show that Americans reported more than 279,000 instances of identity theft in 2011, up from 251,100 a year earlier. While it is unclear how many of those cases involve total identity theft, one possible indicator is the number of identity theft complaints that involve more than one type of identity theft -- 13 percent last year, compared with 12 percent a year earlier.\par \par \uc2 Nationwide, employment-related fraud accounted for 8 percent of identity theft complaints last year. But in states with large immigrant populations, employment-related identity fraud was much higher: 25 percent in Arizona, 15 percent in Texas, 16 percent in New Mexico, 12 percent in California.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors say that the longer a person uses someone else's identity, the more confident the thief becomes using that identity for purposes other than just working.\par \par \uc2 Once they have become established in a community, identity thieves don't want to live in the shadows and they seek a normal life like everybody else. That's when they take the next step and get a driver's license, a home loan and health insurance.\par \par \uc2 "And so that is a natural progression, and that is what we are seeing," said Assistant U.S. Attorney Brent Anderson, who is prosecuting the case against Gutierrez's alleged impostor.\par \par \uc2 Gutierrez first learned her identity had been hijacked when she was turned down for a mortgage more than a decade ago. Now each year she trudges to the \uc2 Social Security Administration\uc2  with her birth certificate, driver's license, passport and even school yearbooks to prove her identity and clear her employment record.\par \par \uc2 She spends hours on the phone with creditors and credit bureaus, fills out affidavits and has yet to clean up her credit history. Her tax records are a mess. She even once phoned the impostor's Kansas employer in a futile effort to find some relief.\par \par \uc2 Both women claimed they were identity theft victims and sought to get new Social Security numbers. The \uc2 Social Security Administration\uc2  turned down the request from Gutierrez, instead issuing a new number to the woman impersonating her. And in another ironic twist, Gutierrez was forced to file her federal income tax forms using a special identification number usually reserved for illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 "It is such a horrible nightmare," Gutierrez said. "You get really angry, and then you start realizing anger is not going to help. ... But when you have so much on your plate and you keep such a busy life, it is really such a super big inconvenience. You have to find the time for someone who is abusing you."\par \par \uc2 When Gutierrez recently got married, her husband began researching identity theft on the Internet and stumbled across identity theft cases filed against other illegal immigrants working at \uc2 Reser's Fine Foods\uc2 , the same manufacturer where Cardona-Gonzalez worked. He contacted federal authorities in Kansas and asked them to investigate the employee working there who had stolen his wife's identity.\par \par \uc2 The alleged impostor was arrested in August, and her fingerprints confirmed that immigration agents had encountered Cardona-Gonzalez in 1996 in Harlingen, Texas, and sent her back to Mexico.\par \par \uc2 Cardona-Gonzalez did not respond to a letter sent to her at the Butler County jail, where she is awaiting trial on charges of aggravated identity theft, misuse of a Social Security number and production of a false document.\par \par \uc2 Her attorney, Matthew Works, did not respond to phone calls and emails seeking comment. Court filings indicate the two sides are negotiating a plea agreement.\par \par \uc2 Citing privacy issues, the \uc2 Social Security Administration\uc2  declined to discuss the Gutierrez case. \uc2 Reser's Fine Foods\uc2  did not return a message left at its Topeka plant.\par \par \uc2 Anderson expects more cases of total identity theft "because we all know what is going on out there -- which is thousands and thousands of people who are working illegally in the United States under false identities, mostly of U.S. citizens, and very little is being done about it. But we are doing something about it, one case at a time."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020121023e8an001gw\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc9}{\*\bkmkend toc9}\b \uc2 Defense: Politics at play for judge in high-profile Ga. case involving illegal immigration\b0\par\par\uc2 By KATE BRUMBACK   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 793 \uc2 words\par \uc2 17 October 2012\par 15:29\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2012.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ATLANTA (AP) - A suburban Atlanta prosecutor has asked a judge to dismiss a case against a young woman from Mexico whose 2010 arrest after a traffic offense nearly led to her deportation, sparking a wider immigration debate. But the judge in the case has previously denied a similar request, and defense lawyers suspect politics may be at play.\par \par \uc2 District Attorney Pat Head filed a strongly worded motion Tuesday asking Cobb County Superior Court Judge Mary Staley to grant a recent defense request to dismiss the case. In the filing, Head appears to make a personal jab at Staley, comparing the charges against Jessica Colotl, to a case involving the judge's sister.\par \par \uc2 "She is too intelligent a woman to actually harbor any kind of anti-immigrant sentiment," defense attorney Jerome Lee said of the elected judge. "So I can only imagine that there is some political aspiration here that's motivating this."\par \par \uc2 Staley did not return a message seeking comment Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 Colotl, whose parents brought her to the U.S. illegally from Mexico when she was 11, was thrust into the national spotlight after she was stopped for a minor traffic violation in March 2010 and then arrested for driving without a license.\par \par \uc2 In February 2011, Colotl was indicted on a charge of false swearing after the \uc2 Cobb County Sheriff's Office\uc2  said she gave deputies false contact information during booking for her arrest. She entered into an agreement with the Cobb County district attorney's office in August 2011 to enter a pretrial diversion program, a solution Staley signed off on.\par \par \uc2 Following a media report that quoted Cobb County Sheriff Neil Warren as calling the deal a "slap on the wrist" and something he hadn't agreed to, Staley called a new hearing on Colotl's eligibility for the program. In an October 2011, she reopened the case and instructed the district attorney to talk with the sheriff and consider his opinion.\par \par \uc2 Since then, Colotl's case has appeared on the court's docket every two weeks, meaning she and a lawyer have had to appear in court repeatedly for a case that is never called, Lee said.\par \par \uc2 Head complied with the judge's order and talked to Warren, but determined Colotl was indeed eligible for the program, Head writes in a motion filed Tuesday requesting that Staley grant Colotl's lawyer's request last week to dismiss the case.\par \par \uc2 Warren didn't return messages seeking comment Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 Colotl has since fulfilled all of her obligations under the pretrial diversion program. She performed 150 hours of community service, and Head has filed documents advising the court he has no intention of prosecuting the case further.\par \par \uc2 Staley last month issued an order denying Head's filing. The judge said she refused to follow his recommendation not to pursue the case because the sheriff's office has "raised legitimate concerns that have not been adequately addressed." Staley also cited a misdemeanor conviction against Colotl, saying that has "consistently disqualified entry" into the county's pretrial diversion program.\par \par \uc2 Head's motion notes that Georgia law governing pretrial diversion programs "shall be at the discretion of the prosecuting attorney." He writes that his office has seen no correspondence between the sheriff and the judge regarding Warren's concerns.\par \par \uc2 Head also points out that the guidelines for the pretrial diversion program clearly allow the district attorney to make exceptions. Colotl's acceptance into the program is not unusual for a person with no history of violence or aggression and a single misdemeanor conviction of driving without a license, and nothing about the pending charge of false swearing disqualifies her either, he wrote.\par \par \uc2 "Individuals charged with False Statement and even Forgery in the First Degree have been successfully admitted into the Pretrial Diversion Program," Head wrote. He cited a 2007 case that the Marietta Daily Journal says involves Staley's sister.\par \par \uc2 After Colotl's traffic stop in 2010, she was handed over by the \uc2 Cobb County Sheriff's Office\uc2  to federal immigration authorities and spent more than a month in a detention center in Alabama. Immigration authorities eventually released her, saying they would give her a year to finish her studies at \uc2 Kennesaw State University\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 She has since graduated and been granted extensions of that deferred action on her case and is in the process of applying for an Obama administration program that allows certain \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  young people to avoid deportation for two years and apply for a work permit.\par \par \uc2 Colotl's immigration attorney \uc2 Charles Kuck\uc2  said the pending case in Cobb County shouldn't affect her immigration case.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Follow Brumback at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.twitter.com/katebrumback"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.twitter.com/katebrumback}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020121017e8ah003r7\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

(AP) - A former Kansas soldier has been sentenced to 10 months in prison for entering into a sham marriage so he could get additional military benefits and his Jamaican bride could become a legal immigrant.\par \par \uc2 Joshua Priest briefly apologized at his hearing Monday in federal court in Wichita. The former Fort Riley private pleaded guilty in July to conspiracy to commit marriage fraud and wire fraud.\par \par \uc2 U.S. District Judge Monti Belot rejected a request from prosecutors to be lenient because Priest had been cooperative. Priest had testified against his wife, Shannakay Hunter. The judge told Priest he violated the oath he took as a soldier.\par \par \uc2 Belot also ordered restitution of nearly $30,000 for the fraudulently obtained housing and subsistence benefits given married soldiers.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020121015e8af0029l\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The sponsor of a New Jersey bill to tighten restrictions on human trafficking told an Assembly panel Monday that the practice isn't just restricted to impoverished, foreign countries.\par \par \uc2 "It's modern day slavery," said Assemblywoman Valerie Vainieri Huttle. "You may think it only happens in developing nations, but it happens right here in New Jersey."\par \par \uc2 Human trafficking has been classified as a felony in the state since 2005, but there have been only 33 defendants charged with the offense, and no convictions to date, said Daniel Phillips of New Jersey's Administrative Office of the Courts.\par \par \uc2 Vainieri Huttle, the Bergen County Democrat sponsoring the Human Trafficking Prevention, Protection, and Treatment Act, said the law doesn't go far enough, and the lack of convictions speaks to the fact that human trafficking cases are underreported.\par \par \uc2 The bill, which has a companion in the Senate, would create a 15-member state commission on human trafficking, expand the list of offenses related to trafficking and increase protection for victims, including vacating prior prostitution convictions for minors found to have been victims of trafficking. It also would tighten penalties on those who fail to verify that advertisers on their sites are not minors, expand training for law enforcement officials and establish so-called "John schools," to educate customers who solicit prostitutes about the industry's exploitation of trafficked labor and minors.\par \par \uc2 Vainieri Huttle said she's pushing for tighter trafficking legislation ahead of New Jersey hosting the 2014 Super Bowl, the kind of event that historically sees an increase in sex trafficking.\par \par \uc2 Separately, New Jersey's attorney general in July announced the creation of a new unit to expand his office's work on combating human trafficking and train law enforcement officials to recognize potential human trafficking cases.\par \par \uc2 Experts say human trafficking takes many forms, from trafficking in sex workers -- often minors -- to underground labor networks that supply businesses with exploited labor. Victims come from all socio-economic backgrounds and can range from an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  smuggled into the country to an American teenager born and raised in the suburbs.\par \par \uc2 Human trafficking is prevalent in New Jersey because of its location as a transportation hub, the diversity of its population and the prevalence of businesses that sometimes hire trafficked workers, such as prostitution networks, strip clubs, massage parlors and farms, said Kate Keisel, the New Jersey program coordinator for the \uc2 Polaris Project\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Polaris, which operates the National Human Trafficking Resource Center hotline and pushes for stronger state and federal anti-trafficking laws, received 100 calls to the hotline from trafficking victims in New Jersey in just the first quarter of this year, said Executive Director Bradley Myles.\par \par \uc2 Newark resident Ingrid Johnson testified before the committee Monday that despite having a good job as a nurse and providing a loving home for her children, her 14-year-old daughter ran away and was recruited into prostitution until she was able to escape.\par \par \uc2 Johnson, whose daughter is back home and is now a junior in college, said she decided to speak out in hopes she could reach others, like her, who; "due to the shame and stigma of a good parent dealing with this issue, are afraid to talk about it."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Follow Samantha Henry at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.twitter.com/SamanthaHenry"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.twitter.com/SamanthaHenry}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020121015e8af00232\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) - A newly formed sheriffs group said Friday it may lobby for the repeal of a New Mexico law allowing illegal immigrants to obtain driver's licenses.\par \par \uc2 A number of sheriffs oppose the law, saying it could lead to illegal immigrants using fake addresses, and criminal syndicates getting licenses for those living illegally in the country, said Jack LeVick, executive director of the New Mexico Sheriffs' Association.\par \par \uc2 "We just have a whole lot of concerns," LeVick said. "Different problems keep surfacing for law enforcement here in New Mexico."\par \par \uc2 LeVick said members will vote in 10 days on whether the group will launch lobbying efforts to repeal the law during the next legislative session.\par \par \uc2 The announcement came after Gov. Susana Martinez said the law has kept New Mexico from complying with a nationwide law imposing security standards for driver's licenses.\par \par \uc2 In a letter to Homeland Security Secretary \uc2 Janet Napolitano\uc2 , Martinez asked for clarification of what will happen to New Mexico and other states if they fail by 2013 to meet the requirements of the Real ID Act, enacted in 2005.\par \par \uc2 The National Conference of State Legislatures said 17 states have passed laws that prohibit compliance with the Real ID program.\par \par \uc2 Martinez, who supports a repeal of the New Mexico law, said she intends to press lawmakers again on the move during the next legislative session.\par \par \uc2 In April, sheriffs from New Mexico's 33 counties organized under the New Mexico Sheriffs' Association to offer deputies advanced training and to build a lobbying force to help change state laws and beef up sheriff's departments.\par \par \uc2 The group promises to educate sheriffs on budget matters, create a pipeline for developing future law enforcement leaders, and lobby state lawmakers on issues.\par \par \uc2 Marcela Diaz of Somos Un Pueblo Unido, a Santa Fe-based immigrant advocacy organization, said she's not surprised that the new group would lobby to repeal the driver's license law, since some sheriffs did the same during the last legislative session.\par \par \uc2 She said immigrant advocates don't see how repealing the law would make the state safer since it would mean law enforcement wouldn't be able to keep track of immigrants at all.\par \par \uc2 "This is being framed as a political issue not a policy issue," Diaz said. "We would be happy to work with law enforcement on fraud issues."\par \par \uc2 Diaz said a coalition of immigration advocates, religious leaders and students also plans to lobby to keep the law.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Follow Russell Contreras on Twitter at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://twitter.com/russcontreras"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://twitter.com/russcontreras}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020121012e8ac0030j\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHOENIX (AP) - A U.S. Border Patrol agent opened fire on a group of people throwing rocks from across the Mexican border, killing a teenage boy and eliciting outrage from the Mexican government over the use of lethal force, authorities said Thursday.\par \par \uc2 The agents in Nogales, Ariz., had responded to reports of two suspected drugs smugglers near the border at about 11:30 p.m. Wednesday. The agents watched the two abandon a load of narcotics, then run back to Mexico, according to the Border Patrol.\par \par \uc2 As the agents approached to investigate, people on the Mexican side of the border began throwing rocks at them and ignored orders to stop, the agency said.\par \par \uc2 One agent opened fire. A Mexican official with direct knowledge of the investigation said Thursday a teenage boy was killed in the shooting. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not yet authorized to discuss details of the case.\par \par \uc2 The Border Patrol declined to comment further, and would only say in a statement that one person "appeared to have been" shot by the agent.\par \par \uc2 The agency said it has notified the Mexican government, and the FBI has begun an investigation.\par \par \uc2 The Mexican government issued a strongly worded statement, condemning the use of lethal force by U.S. agents in such situations along the border.\par \par \uc2 "Preliminary information at this time brings forth, once again, serious doubts about the use of lethal force by U.S. Border Patrol agents, something that both the Mexican Government and Mexican society strongly deplore and condemn," Ricardo Alday, a spokesman for the Mexican Embassy in Washington, said in the statement.\par \par \uc2 "It is imperative that the relevant U.S. authorities proceed with a timely and transparent investigation," Alday added. "Mexican authorities will proceed accordingly within their jurisdiction."\par \par \uc2 Border agents are generally allowed to use lethal force against rock throwers.\par \par \uc2 In 2010, a 15-year-old boy was shot and killed by a Border Patrol agent firing his weapon from El Paso, Texas, into Juarez, Mexico. Some witnesses said people on the Mexican side of the river, including the teen, were throwing rocks at the agent as he tried to arrest an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  crossing the Rio Grande.\par \par \uc2 A federal judge in El Paso last year dismissed a lawsuit by the family of the boy because the teen was on the Mexican side of the Rio Grande when he was shot. U.S. law gives the government immunity when such claims arise in a foreign country, the judge noted.\par \par \uc2 A \uc2 U.S. Department of Justice\uc2  investigation, which included interviews with more than 25 civilian and law-enforcement witnesses, determined no federal civil rights charges could be pursued because "accident, mistake, misperception, negligence and bad judgment were not sufficient to establish a federal criminal civil rights violation."\par \par \uc2 An investigation was ongoing over another fatal shooting by an agent last month after the Mexican government said a Mexican citizen was killed when the agent patrolling the Rio Grande fired his weapon across the border.\par \par \uc2 The Border Patrol said agents were aboard a boat near Laredo when a group of people began throwing rocks at them. One of the agents fired shots across the border toward Nuevo Laredo. The agency said it wasn't clear whether anyone had been hit by bullets, but Mexico's Foreign Relations Department issued a statement saying a Mexican citizen had been fatally shot.\par \par \uc2 The Mexican government at the time protested the use of what it called disproportionate force in immigration control and demanded a thorough investigation.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020121011e8ab0046j\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The agents watched the two abandon a load of narcotics, then run back to Mexico, according to the Border Patrol.\par \par \uc2 As the agents approached to investigate, people on the Mexican side of the border began throwing rocks at them and ignored orders to stop, the agency said.\par \par \uc2 One agent opened fire, apparently striking a suspect, but injuries had not yet been confirmed Thursday.\par \par \uc2 The Border Patrol said it has notified the Mexican government, and the FBI has begun an investigation.\par \par \uc2 The agency declined to comment further.\par \par \uc2 Border agents are generally allowed to use lethal force against rock throwers.\par \par \uc2 In 2010, a 15-year-old boy was shot and killed by a Border Patrol agent firing his weapon from El Paso, Texas, into Juarez, Mexico. Some witnesses said people on the Mexican side of the river, including the teen, were throwing rocks at the agent as he tried to arrest an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  crossing the Rio Grande.\par \par \uc2 A federal judge in El Paso last year dismissed a lawsuit by the family of the boy because the teen was on the Mexican side of the Rio Grande when he was shot. U.S. law gives the government immunity when such claims arise in a foreign country, the judge noted.\par \par \uc2 A \uc2 U.S. Department of Justice\uc2  investigation, which included interviews with more than 25 civilian and law-enforcement witnesses, determined no federal civil rights charges could be pursued because "accident, mistake, misperception, negligence and bad judgment were not sufficient to establish a federal criminal civil rights violation."\par \par \uc2 An investigation was ongoing over another fatal shooting by an agent last month after the Mexican government said a Mexican citizen was killed when the agent patrolling the Rio Grande fired his weapon across the border.\par \par \uc2 The Border Patrol said agents were aboard a boat near Laredo when a group of people began throwing rocks at them. One of the agents fired shots across the border toward Nuevo Laredo. The agency said it wasn't clear whether anyone had been hit by bullets, but Mexico's Foreign Relations Department issued a statement saying a Mexican citizen had been fatally shot.\par \par \uc2 The Mexican government at the time protested the use of what it called disproportionate force in immigration control and demanded a thorough investigation.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020121011e8ab002z2\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

"Tests were negative for meningitis!! They will do blood draws for 72 hours following, to be sure! But I am ok!"\par \par \uc2 Though Stevens, of Maple Grove, got good news, others are either waiting for test results or have yet to be tested.\par \par \uc2 State health officials worked to notify 831 people that they might have been injected with the steroid at several Minneapolis-area pain clinics. Health Department spokesman Buddy Ferguson says the state had largely finished that work on Monday.\par \par \uc2 No new cases were confirmed Monday. Minnesota has three people with confirmed cases of the fungal meningitis that has broken out in nine states.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Minn. trial reveals details of life with al-Shabab\par \par \uc2 MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- A Minnesota man who left the United States to join a terror group in Somalia told others he wanted to return to Minneapolis because a friend was sick. Instead, he was somehow talked into staying and ended up killing himself in a suicide bombing months later.\par \par \uc2 Shirwa Ahmed was among more than 20 young men who left Minnesota since 2007 to join al-Shabab, a group linked to al-Qaida that's at the center of much of the violence in Somalia.\par \par \uc2 Details about his apparent desire to leave the group in 2008 -- and the experiences of others who lived in fear and secrecy while under al-Shabab's thumb -- have started to emerge in the trial of another man accused of helping direct men to the cause. Two men have already testified about their time in Somalia, saying they were told to give up their names and travel documents, and one was threatened with beheading if he tried to leave.\par \par \uc2 "We were scared to death," Salah Osman Ahmed told jurors in the trial of Mahamud Said Omar, who faces five terror-related counts.\par \par \uc2 Omar's attorneys say he is not guilty. They say the government witnesses, who are awaiting sentencing in their own terror cases, are lying about Omar's role in the pipeline that carried fighters from Minneapolis to Somalia. Eighteen men have been charged in the case, but Omar is the first to go to trial.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Feds won't act against journalist in US illegally\par \par \uc2 MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Immigration authorities said Monday they won't take action against a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist who was arrested in Minnesota for driving without a valid license.\par \par \uc2 Jose Antonio Vargas attracted national attention last year when he revealed that he's an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . He was scheduled to speak at \uc2 Carleton College\uc2  in Northfield last Friday but never made it.\par \par \uc2 When a state trooper stopped him in Minneapolis for driving with headphones on, Vargas produced a canceled Washington state driver's license, said Lt. Eric Roeske, a spokesman for the Minnesota State Patrol.\par \par \uc2 "He did not have a valid license, and the identification he produced when the trooper ran a check on it indicated it was canceled due to some sort of fraudulent activity, so there was some doubt to his actual identity," Roeske said.\par \par \uc2 Vargas was booked at the Hennepin County Jail and released on his own recognizance Friday pending a court appearance set for Oct. 18. The State Patrol contacted Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Roeske said, but the federal agency did not block his release.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Hoffner attorney: Officials find no abuse evidence\par \par \uc2 MANKATO, Minn. (AP) -- The attorney for the Minnesota St., Mankato, football coach who faces child pornography charges says county officials found no evidence that his client abused his kids.\par \par \uc2 Todd Hoffner's attorney released letters Monday that Blue Earth County social worker Holly Barkeim sent to Hoffner and his wife in late September.\par \par \uc2 The Mankato Free Press reports ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://bit.ly/PjLd0Rhttp://bit.ly/PjLd0R"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://bit.ly/PjLd0Rhttp://bit.ly/PjLd0R}}}\uc2  ) that in those letters, Barkeim says child protection services are not needed.\par \par \uc2 Hoffner was charged in late August after videos of his three children dancing naked and touching themselves were found on his work-issued cellphone.\par \par \uc2 Hoffner's wife and his attorney have said the videos are innocent family moments.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020121009e8a90007q\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 MINNEAPOLIS (AP) - Immigration authorities said Monday they won't take action against a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist who was arrested in Minnesota for driving without a valid license.\par \par \uc2 Jose Antonio Vargas attracted national attention last year when he revealed that he's an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . He was scheduled to speak at \uc2 Carleton College\uc2  in Northfield last Friday but never made it.\par \par \uc2 When a state trooper stopped him in Minneapolis for driving with headphones on, Vargas produced a canceled Washington state driver's license, said Lt. Eric Roeske, a spokesman for the Minnesota State Patrol.\par \par \uc2 "He did not have a valid license, and the identification he produced when the trooper ran a check on it indicated it was canceled due to some sort of fraudulent activity, so there was some doubt to his actual identity," Roeske said.\par \par \uc2 Vargas was booked at the Hennepin County Jail and released on his own recognizance Friday pending a court appearance set for Oct. 18. The State Patrol contacted Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Roeske said, but the federal agency did not block his release.\par \par \uc2 An ICE spokeswoman in Washington said Monday that the agency intends to leave Vargas alone because he's not a high priority.\par \par \uc2 "Mr. Vargas was not arrested by ICE nor did the agency issue a detainer," Gillian Christensen said in an email statement. "ICE is focused on smart, effective immigration enforcement that prioritizes the removal of public safety threats, recent border crossers and egregious immigration law violators, such as those who have been previously removed from the United States."\par \par \uc2 Vargas was part of a \uc2 Washington Post\uc2  team that won a Pulitzer in 2008 for coverage of the Virginia Tech massacre. The revelation about his immigration status, in an essay published in the \uc2 New York Times Magazine\uc2  in June 2011, raised questions about what his former employers knew of his legal status. The Post condemned him for keeping it secret.\par \par \uc2 Washington state officials canceled Vargas' driver' license in July 2011. He wrote in his essay that he obtained it after the Oregon license he used to get his job at the Post expired.\par \par \uc2 Vargas did not immediately return messages seeking comment Monday.\par \par \uc2 He wrote in his Times essay that his mother sent him from the Philippines to live with grandparents in California in 1993 when he was 12 years old. He wrote that he didn't find out he was in the country illegally until he applied for a driver's permit with forged documents.\par \par \uc2 Vargas now leads an initiative called "Define American," which campaigns for immigration reform.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020121008e8a800360\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) - A Northern California-based grocery store chain that caters to Latino immigrants has come under fire for participating in a federal program that checks the immigration status of prospective workers.\par \par \uc2 A coalition of groups, including the United Food and Commercial Workers Union Local 5, on Monday called for a boycott of San Jose-based Mi Pueblo in part because of the chain's participation in the E-Verify program. The program is voluntary in California.\par \par \uc2 The company said on Friday that it joined E-Verify after federal immigration officials launched an audit of its existing workers' immigration status in August, the \uc2 San Jose Mercury News\uc2  reported ( {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://bit.ly/SA6jcp"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://bit.ly/SA6jcp}}}\uc2 ).\par \par \uc2 The chain's founder, \uc2 Juvenal Chavez\uc2 , himself a former \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , has briefed employees over the past week, the Los Angeles Times reported ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://sacb.ee/Q8GZVM"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://sacb.ee/Q8GZVM}}}\uc2 ) over the weekend. The company is also launching a radio show to educate families who could be affected by the audit and plans to conduct outreach to community organizations and churches.\par \par \uc2 Mi Pueblo spokeswoman Perla Rodriguez told the Times that Chavez has vowed to rehire any worker fired for being in the country illegally but who later gains legal status. He will also continue to push for comprehensive immigration reform.\par \par \uc2 Mi Pueblo was founded in 1991. It now has 21 stores in the San Francisco Bay area, the Central Valley and the Monterey Bay region.\par \par \uc2 The groups, calling themselves the Justice for Mercados Campaign, are led by the UFCW, which is trying to organize Mi Pueblo's more than 3,000 workers, said union spokesman Eriberto Fernandez.\par \par \uc2 "Workers have met with a lot of intimidation, some firings and retaliation for unionizing," Eriberto Fernandez said.\par \par \uc2 "We're asking the community not to shop at Mi Pueblo until the situation is resolved," he said.\par \par \uc2 In a statement, the campaign said it is trying to determine if in fact Mi Pueblo is being audited. It says Mi Pueblo could stop any audit by informing federal officials that the company is in the midst of a labor dispute reflected by the ongoing organizing effort by the union.\par \par \uc2 In a statement, the group said the boycott will continue "until such time as Mi Pueblo respects the rights of its workers and the members of the communities in which it operates and until it rescinds E-Verify and sticks up for its employees instead of cooperating with an I-9 audit that can be stopped."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Information from: San Jose (Calif.)

CALDWELL   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 671 \uc2 words\par \uc2 3 October 2012\par 13:25\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2012.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The issue:\par \par \uc2 Illegal immigration is a decades-old problem. With an estimated 11.5 million illegal immigrants living, and in many cases working, in the U.S. the question remains: What do we do with them? And how do we stop more people from coming? Lax enforcement potentially leads to more illegal immigrants competing with U.S. citizens for jobs and some social services, without necessarily paying income taxes. But a too-tight policy could mean farmers and others in industries that rely on the cheaper labor of illegal immigrants are left begging for workers, passing higher costs on to consumers or going out of business altogether.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Where they stand:\par \par \uc2 President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  has pushed for the DREAM Act, a path to citizenship for many young illegal immigrants who arrived in the U.S. as children. Efforts to pass the bill have repeatedly failed, most notably in 2010 when it stalled in a Democratic-led Senate after failing to win the 60 votes it needed to proceed to a full vote. Five Democrats voted against the measure. In June, Obama announced a plan to delay deportations for many illegal immigrants who would have benefited from the DREAM Act for up to two years and let them get work permits.\par \par \uc2 Mitt Romney has said that as president he would veto the DREAM Act should it ever cross his desk. He told The Denver Post that he would honor work permits for those immigrants who benefit from Obama's new policy and promised to put a comprehensive immigration plan into place before those permits expire. He favors completing a towering steel fence along the Mexican border, in addition to the 650 miles already constructed, and opposes letting \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students pay in-state tuition at state universities.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Why it matters:\par \par \uc2 Illegal immigration has slowed in recent years, with the Border Patrol recently recording the fewest arrests in almost 40 years. But many people worry that the Mexican border, the most popular crossing point for newly arriving illegal immigrants, still isn't secure more than a decade after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.\par \par \uc2 In the last several years, the government has spent billions building a fence, doubling the number of Border Patrol agents and adding a slew of high-tech gadgets to stop the flow of illegal immigrants. The numbers tell a compelling story: In the last budget year, the Border Patrol arrested about 327,000 people at the Mexican border. In 2006, agents made more than 1 million such arrests.\par \par \uc2 Obama's administration also deported a record number of people last year, nearly 400,000. The government has been shifting its focus to finding and deporting criminal immigrants and those who otherwise pose a threat to security.\par \par \uc2 There's room for debate about what has led to the steep drop in arrests; it's quite clear the struggling economy has made it less attractive to enter the U.S. Still, Republicans insist any illegal crossings are too many. And there's broad agreement that the border should be more secure.\par \par \uc2 As for illegal immigrants already in the country, there's no easy answer about what to do.\par \par \uc2 In 1986, under President Ronald Reagan, Congress approved an amnesty that granted millions of immigrants legal status while also changing the law to make it illegal to hire illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Hiring has continued in many sectors, notably farming. And some lawmakers worry that agriculture would sink if there were an aggressive effort to verify that all farmworkers could legally work in the U.S.\par \par \uc2 Various overhauls of immigration policy have been proposed since the early 2000s. But the debate often boils down to Republicans wanting the border secure before anything else, and Democrats pushing for that security and for a path to legalization at once. The result has been a legislative stalemate.\par \par \uc2 ----\par \par \uc2 Follow Alicia A.

He complied with every rule," Godinez-Samperio's attorney and former American Bar Association president Talbot "Sandy" D'Alemberte, said after the hearing.\par \par \uc2 Godinez-Samperio's case is one of a few across the country. Illegal immigrants in New York and California also want to practice law there.\par \par \uc2 The Board of Bar Examiners in Florida found no reason to deny the 25-year-old Godinez-Samperio a license but asked the state's high court for guidance, said the board's lawyer, Robert Blythe.\par \par \uc2 "It's not really about this applicant," Blythe said. "It's a broader question."\par \par \uc2 Justice Barbara Pariente compared Godinez-Samperio's status to someone who doesn't pay federal income tax.\par \par \uc2 "The board would never recommend that person for admission to the practice of law," Pariente said.\par \par \uc2 Later, though, she suggested the court could temporarily license Godinez-Samperio. The seven justices questioned lawyers about the possibility of a limited license that would let Godinez-Samperio do free legal work and discussed delaying their decision to see if he obtains a work permit under a policy President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  announced in June.\par \par \uc2 "Somebody's trying to make it a -- literally -- a federal case, but we're talking about one person right now out of thousands every year," Pariente said.\par \par \uc2 Obama issued a directive to protect immigrants who are 30 or younger and entered the country illegally as children. It exempts them from deportation and offers temporary work permits and Social Security cards for those who apply. It does not provide a path to citizenship.\par \par \uc2 Pariente said Obama's policy "may or may not continue" if the Democratic president is defeated in November. Republican challenger \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2  said Tuesday he would honor the temporary work permits under Obama's policy while promising comprehensive immigration reform before the two-year visas expire.\par \par \uc2 Godinez-Samperio said the election may decide his future.\par \par \uc2 "The voters need to take into account that the president they elect is going to make a lot of these policy changes," he said. "And \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2  has been a failure at being clear on his immigration position."\par \par \uc2 The Florida justices are appointed by the governor and up for retention votes every six years. Three are on the ballot this year and are opposed by the GOP, a break from a typically nonpartisan election.\par \par \uc2 Justice Charles Canady also expressed reservations, citing a federal law that prohibits state agencies from licensing illegal immigrants. He noted the case in California, where the \uc2 U.S. Justice Department\uc2  filed brief with the Supreme Court there opposing bar admission for Sergio Garcia.\par \par \uc2 Garcia also came illegally to the U.S from Mexico when he was a child, but he would not qualify for a work permit under Obama's new policy because he is 35 years old.\par \par \uc2 D'Alemberte, who also is a former Florida State University president and taught his client when he was a law student, said the federal law doesn't apply because the \uc2 Florida Supreme Court\uc2  is not an "agency." He also argued the states have a constitutional right to decide who practices law in their courts.\par \par \uc2 At least one Florida justice, Cuban immigrant and naturalized citizen Jorge Labarga, seemed to support Godinez-Samperio.\par \par \uc2 "If he's afforded a Social Security card that means he can work," Labarga said. "Then what's the issue?"\par \par \uc2 In New York, Ceasar Vargas has passed the bar exam but is waiting to see what happens in Florida and California before applying for a license. Vargas, whose parents illegally brought him to the U.S. from Mexico when he was 5, graduated from the \uc2 City University of New York\uc2  law school.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020121002e8a20012t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc28}{\*\bkmkend toc28}\b \uc2 Ready for the big debate: Romney says he might cut tax deductions as a way to trim US deficit\b0\par\par\uc2 By KASIE HUNT   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 1,262 \uc2 words\par \uc2 2 October 2012\par 18:52\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2012.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 DENVER (AP) - Offering deficit-cutting ideas before his first debate with President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 , \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2  says he might be willing to reduce income tax deductions used by millions of families for home mortgage interest and health care costs\par \par \uc2 He suggested the changes could be part of a plan that includes a 20 percent cut in tax rates across the board, continuation of upper income tax cuts that Obama wants to end and a comprehensive tax overhaul plan that the Republican presidential contender has so far declined to flesh out in detail. Romney says his overall plans would invigorate the slowly recovering U.S. economy.\par \par \uc2 Both Romney and Obama spent their time mostly in private on Tuesday, preparing for the debate, the president in Henderson, Nev., near Las Vegas, Romney already in Denver where the faceoff will take place Wednesday at 9 p.m. EDT. Neither held public campaign events, but Obama took a break from preparation to visit nearby Hoover Dam, and Romney picked up lunch at a \uc2 Chipotle Mexican Grill\uc2  near his hotel.\par \par \uc2 In an interview Monday night with Denver TV station KDVR, Romney said, "As an option you could say everybody's going to get up to a $17,000 deduction. And you could use your charitable deduction, your home mortgage deduction, or others -- your health care deduction, and you can fill that bucket, if you will, that $17,000 bucket that way. And higher income people might have a lower number."\par \par \uc2 A Romney adviser said changes in other areas -- a taxpayer's personal exemption and the deduction or credit for health care -- would also be taken into account if deductions were limited as Romney suggested. Combining changes to those two areas with the limit on deductions would maintain Romney's goal of keeping tax burdens the same for wealthy and middle income taxpayers, the adviser said.\par \par \uc2 On another controversial subject, in a separate local interview ahead of the debate, Romney told The \uc2 Denver Post\uc2  that he would honor the temporary permission the Obama administration has granted to many young illegal immigrants to allow them to stay in the country.\par \par \uc2 Obama announced in June that he would prevent deportation for some children brought to the United States by \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  parents. Applicants must not have a serious criminal record and must meet other requirements, such as graduating from high school or serving in the U.S. military.\par \par \uc2 Romney had previously refused to say if he would retain the policy if he won the election.\par \par \uc2 He granted the interviews as he and Obama looked ahead to the debate, the first of three they will hold before Election Day on Nov. 6.\par \par \uc2 The debates, expected to draw a huge nationwide audience, takes place with most polls showing Obama slightly ahead both nationally and in the battleground states expected to settle the election.\par \par \uc2 Away from Denver, the campaign pressed ahead Tuesday on TV airwaves, in courts and in local election officials' offices across the states.\par \par \uc2 The Romney-supporting independent group Crossroads GPS launched an $11 million, 10-day ad campaign in eight swing states. Its new ad criticizes Obama's assertion that unemployment would fall if \uc2 Congress\uc2  passed his proposed stimulus law. The national unemployment rate still stands above 8 percent.\par \par \uc2 In Pennsylvania, meanwhile, a judge struck down a much-debated voter identification law, a victory for state Democrats who argued that it would prevent many minorities and elderly people from voting. The judge, \uc2 Robert Simpson\uc2 , wrote that he was concerned by the state's stumbling efforts to create a photo ID that would be easily accessible to voters. Pennsylvania, while long considered a battleground state, has backed Democrats in presidential elections for decades, and Romney has trailed Obama in polls there.\par \par \uc2 On another voter-eligibility matter, Romney's campaign has sent letters to election officials in Wisconsin, Mississippi and Vermont asking that the deadline for receiving ballots from military and overseas voters be extended.\par \par \uc2 In Denver, in his comments on taxes, Romney also cited the tax plan included in the Simpson-Bowles deficit commission recommendations as a possible course. That plan calls for reducing the top income tax rates. To pay for that, the plan would eliminate or reduce many popular tax breaks, including deductions for charitable donations and mortgage interest.\par \par \uc2 While Romney did not commit to making any specific changes, saying he would work with \uc2 Congress\uc2 , his suggestions were more specific than those he had offered in the past and provided a new window into his thinking on the subject. In the spring, Romney told donors that he would consider eliminating home mortgage deductions for second homes. That conversation, behind closed doors, was overheard by reporters standing on a private sidewalk.\par \par \uc2 The numbers are important because Romney has said that he will lower tax rates across the board without reducing government revenue. He also says he wants wealthy Americans to continue to shoulder the same share of the tax burden as they do today. One way to make the numbers add up would be to adjust tax deductions and exemptions.\par \par \uc2 Romney campaign spokeswoman Andrea Saul insisted his plan still would cut taxes for middle income earners. "There are a range of policy options, Gov. Romney referenced one illustrative example, to achieve these goals," Saul said in an emailed statement. She did not mention any other options.\par \par \uc2 Vice presidential nominees \uc2 Joe Biden\uc2  and \uc2 Paul Ryan\uc2  campaigned Tuesday in North Carolina and Iowa, respectively. Romney's campaign is looking to regain ground on Obama after falling further behind in battleground state polls in the wake of a video showing the Republican telling donors that 47 percent of Americans believe they are victims who are entitled to government assistance. A voter in Iowa asked Ryan about the exchange, and he acknowledged Romney's comments had muddied the political landscape.\par \par \uc2 "Sometimes the point doesn't get made the right way," he said.\par \par \uc2 Romney's interviews with Denver outlets were the last ones planned before he takes the stage Wednesday night. Moderator \uc2 Jim Lehrer\uc2  plans to focus on the economy, health care and the role of government.\par \par \uc2 Romney's tax plans are likely to be one focus. U.S. tax law at one time limited tax deductions and personal exemptions for high income people, but those limits were removed as part of the massive package of tax cuts passed under President \uc2 George W. Bush\uc2 . The limits are scheduled to return next year, when the Bush-era tax cuts are scheduled to expire unless \uc2 Congress\uc2  acts in the meantime. Romney and other Republicans want to extend all the tax cuts while \uc2 Congress\uc2  works to overhaul the federal tax code. Obama wants to extend them for individuals making less than $200,000 and married couples making less than $250,000.\par \par \uc2 Romney says his plan would generate the same amount of tax revenue as the current system but do it more efficiently, without raising taxes on any group of people. Romney also says he would not raise taxes on investment income.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Tax Policy Center\uc2 , a nonpartisan research group, says it is impossible to reduce tax rates by 20 percent for the wealthy without shifting some of the tax burden to middle class families. The Romney campaign disputes the study, which has also been challenged by several conservative think tanks.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writers Julie Pace in Nevada, Philip Elliott in Iowa, and \uc2 Steve Peoples\uc2  and \uc2 David Espo\uc2  in Washington contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020121002e8a20004s\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 BROWNSVILLE, Texas (AP) - When a regional manager for the Mexican Gulf cartel moved his operation to a more lucrative territory on the border, he took along not only his armored trucks and personal army, but also his department heads and a team of accountants.\par \par \uc2 In the grotesque violence that has enveloped Mexico it's easy to lose sight of the fact that, ultimately, these criminal organizations are complex businesses that rely on careful accounting as much as assault rifles. The structures underlying the most successful criminal organizations are stable in a way that means capturing or killing the man at the top may only be a temporary setback and pinching one revenue stream will only drive a search for others.\par \par \uc2 Rafael Cardenas Vela, a Gulf cartel member who ran three important "plazas," or territories, testified this week about the organization's structure and operations in such detail that it could compose a short course -- Narco 101, perhaps.\par \par \uc2 When prosecutors asked Cardenas to walk jurors through a decade of moves in the cartel's command and control structure, he turned to a giant organizational chart that would be recognizable to anyone in the corporate world except for spaces at the bottom for those "arrested" and "deceased."\par \par \uc2 Cardenas explained that in his plaza he had managers in charge of each revenue stream, including marijuana, cocaine and "cuota," or extortion payments demanded of legal and illegal businesses. Each department had an accountant. An additional accountant tracked the "piso," or tax that was charged on any drug loads moving through his territory. Another accountant supervised them all.\par \par \uc2 "I can't do everything myself," Cardenas said. "That's why we have someone in charge of every department."\par \par \uc2 That structure means simply removing the head is often not enough.\par \par \uc2 "You have to keep attacking the command and control elements again and again," said Will Glaspy, who oversees the \uc2 Drug Enforcement Administration\uc2 's operations in Texas' Rio Grande Valley, across the border from Gulf cartel territory.\par \par \uc2 Since Osiel Cardenas Guillen, Rafael Cardenas' uncle, was extradited to the U.S. in 2007, the cases have been building on themselves.\par \par \uc2 The man who took over for Osiel Cardenas was captured this month. Osiel Cardenas' brother was killed by Mexican marines in 2010. Most recently, a third brother was arrested in Mexico this month. Juan Roberto Rincon-Rincon, the plaza boss convicted Friday in Brownsville, is one of three Gulf cartel plaza bosses arrested in the U.S. last year. And Mexican authorities captured another alleged boss this week.\par \par \uc2 "It's the government of Mexico that has had such tremendous success targeting the Gulf cartel over the last five or six years," Glaspy said. "They're the ones who have continued to attack and focus on the command and control of the Gulf cartel."\par \par \uc2 "(The Gulf cartel's) corporate structure doesn't exactly look like a Fortune 500 company, but it's probably not far off," he said.\par \par \uc2 The structure reflects diversified interests. The cartel is still known primarily as a drug-trafficking organization, but it receives important revenue from smuggling immigrants and its extortion rackets.\par \par \uc2 The U.S. Border Patrol sector that covers much of the Gulf cartel's territory seized just over 1 million pounds of marijuana in 2011 and apprehended nearly 60,000 illegal immigrants. The cartel receives a cut for every kilogram of drugs and every \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  that passes through its territory.\par \par \uc2 Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera, chairwoman of the government department at the University of Texas-Brownsville, credits Osiel Cardenas with leading the cartel's structural evolution. She said his nephew's testimony revealed the similarities between today's drug-trafficking organization and a legitimate corporation with transnational networks and diversified interests.\par \par \uc2 Osiel Cardenas' biggest move was creating the Zetas, former special forces troops, as a new department to handle the cartel's security and enforcement, she said.\par \par \uc2 "When (Osiel Cardenas) introduced the Zetas he changed the whole panorama of drug trafficking and organized crime in the hemisphere," she said. Their expansion into other criminal enterprises beyond drug trafficking served as a lesson for their longtime patrons and other criminal organizations. The Zetas split from the cartel in 2010 and became an independent criminal organization.\par \par \uc2 Without the critical smuggling corridors controlled by the Gulf cartel or its supply lines, the Zetas initially couldn't count on drug-trafficking revenue so they diversified to piracy and extortion, Glaspy said.\par \par \uc2 "It's all about the money, and if they're not making the money from drugs they will seek out other criminal activity to reinforce or find other revenue streams," he said.\par \par \uc2 The younger Cardenas testified that it cost him about $1 million a month when he ran the Rio Bravo plaza to cover payroll, rent, vehicles and bribes. He had to recruit, train and equip his own gunmen. When they were killed, he continued paying their salaries to their families.\par \par \uc2 He pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to possess and distribute cocaine and marijuana and is cooperating with U.S. authorities in other cartel cases with the hope of receiving a shorter sentence.\par \par \uc2 Bribes went to every level of law enforcement, the press, members of the military and corrupted U.S. officials, he said.\par \par \uc2 "In order to have your plaza well, all organized, you have to pay all the police agencies," Cardenas said. Paying off the local police in Rio Bravo alone cost $20,000 per week, he said.\par \par \uc2 And when the Gulf cartel began going head to head with the Zetas in early 2010, he said, costs rose to the point where they were just breaking even.\par \par \uc2 Cardenas worked for nearly a decade as a plaza boss. Each of his plazas was within an hour's drive of the Texas border.\par \par \uc2 "All of the plazas that have river on the border are better," he said. More drugs and immigrants crossing, as well as border businesses such as pharmacies popular with American tourists. "More money."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120929e89t00026\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (AP) - Prosecutors have charged four people who own and operate logging companies in the Black Hills of South Dakota with defrauding the federal government by circumventing contract requirements and employing \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  workers, U.S. Attorney Brendan Johnson said Thursday.\par \par \uc2 A federal indictment unsealed Thursday afternoon accuses Angel Munoz-Escalante, who owns and operates Munoz Logging and Construction, Aurelio Munoz-Escalante, owner and operator of Black Hills Thinning, Rogelio Escalante, who owns and operates Escalante Logging, and Sergio Munoz-Escalante, owner and operator of SM Logging, with defrauding the United States and harboring illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Also indicted for harboring illegal immigrants were Barbara Munoz, Christina Pourier, Mario Rangel and Miguel Soto, who all work at the companies, and Benjamin Munoz-Botello, who owns and operates Benja's Mexican Store, a grocery store and check cashing business.\par \par \uc2 Ace Crawford, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's Office, said seven of the nine were arrested Thursday and appeared in U.S. District Court for South Dakota in Rapid City to enter not guilty pleas.\par \par \uc2 Lawyers for eight of the defendants were either not listed on the indictment, were unavailable or would not comment. John Richard Murphy, the lawyer for Sergio Munoz-Escalante, said he was pleased the judge released his client on personal recognizance.\par \par \uc2 Since about January 2008, the four logging companies conspired to defraud the government by bidding on \uc2 U.S. Forest Service\uc2  contracts to thin timber using illegal immigrants, the indictment said. By using \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  workers who were paid less than the prevailing wage, the companies were able to successfully bid lower than other companies -- sometimes by as much as hundreds of thousands of dollars.\par \par \uc2 By employing illegal immigrants "who are not paid fair wages, benefits, and overtime as prescribed by law and as outlined in the contract, they are able to secure profits even when submitting what are much lower bids," the indictment stated.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors said each company would often bid on the same federal contract, and when it was awarded to one of the companies, workers for the other companies would assist in completing the work.\par \par \uc2 Munoz Logging would use one person's name and direct that person to break down the check for several of the workers. The checks were cashed at Benja's Mexican Store in Rapid City because the workers did not have valid documentation, the indictment said.\par \par \uc2 Since January 2009, 23 illegal immigrants working at the companies have been arrested or deported, the indictment said.\par \par \uc2 Johnson, the U.S. Attorney for South Dakota, said the indictment shows his office's commitment to enforcing the nation's immigration laws.\par \par \uc2 "This includes limiting the demand for undocumented workers by prosecuting employers who knowingly hire illegal workers," he said in a news release.\par \par \uc2 Special agents arrested 18 people for immigration violations during the course of the investigation, according to Shawn Neudauer, spokesman for \uc2 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2 's Homeland Security Investigations. In addition to ICE, other federal and state law enforcement agencies involved in the investigation included the \uc2 U.S. Forest Service\uc2 , Rapid City Police Department and the Pennington County Sheriff's Office.\par \par \uc2 Conspiracy to defraud the U.S. carries a maximum sentence of five years in custody and a $250,000 fine. Conspiracy to harbor illegal immigrants and harboring illegal immigrants is punishable by a maximum of 10 years in custody and a $250,000 fine.\par \par \uc2 ----------\par \par \uc2 Follow Kristi Eaton on Twitter at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://twitter.com/kristieaton"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://twitter.com/kristieaton}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120928e89s0003a\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SAN DIEGO (AP) - Schools in Yakima, Wash., are taking nearly a month to deliver transcripts to former students. The Mexican consulate in Denver introduced Saturday hours last month after passport applications spiked by one-third. San Diego public schools added five employees in a new office to handle records requests.\par \par \uc2 Schools and consulates have been flooded with requests for documents after President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  announced a new program allowing young people living in the country illegally to apply for two-year renewable work permits. Up to 1.7 million people may qualify, which would be the broadest stroke to bring illegal immigrants out of the shadows in more than 25 years. Applicants -- some eager to get in line before November's presidential elections -- are finding they may have to wait a few weeks longer for a prize that has eluded them for years.\par \par \uc2 The clamor for documents is an early sign that the policy is highly popular. The Obama administration said this month that it approved the first 29 applications among more than 82,000 received since it began accepting requests Aug. 15.\par \par \uc2 The Mexican consulate in Los Angeles issued 17,444 passports and consular identification cards in August, up 63 percent from the same period last year, said Consul General David Figueroa, who attributes the entire increase to the new policy. The wait for a passport appointment at the largest Mexican consulate grew from one or two days to 40 days last month, then fell to 30 days after the consulate hired five employees to handle the increased workload, opened its main office on Saturdays and extended hours at satellite offices to seven days a week from five.\par \par \uc2 U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services recently clarified expectations, relieving applicants who worried they would need exhaustive proof of their whereabouts. Eligible applicants must have come to the U.S. before they turned 16, be 30 or younger, be high school graduates or in college, or have served in the military, and they cannot have serious criminal records. They also must have lived in the country since June 2007.\par \par \uc2 The new guidelines, issued Sept. 14, say applicants should provide as much evidence "as reasonably possible" that they stayed in the U.S. -- ideally for every year -- but that they don't have to account for every day of the last five years.\par \par \uc2 The government also reassured employers who were nervous about providing evidence that they hired an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . Documents will not be used against employers unless they committed "egregious violations of criminal statues or widespread abuses."\par \par \uc2 Laura Lichter, a Denver attorney and president of the \uc2 American Immigration Lawyers Association\uc2 , said the new guidelines alleviated many concerns for applicants.\par \par \uc2 "I have to compliment (the government) for doing an excellent job of getting good, solid information out there," said Lichter, adding that she rarely praises the authorities.\par \par \uc2 Rep. Lamar Smith, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee and a critic of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy, called the latest changes an example of how the Obama administration "routinely puts illegal immigrants first at the expense of the American people."\par \par \uc2 "Administration officials intentionally made these guidelines vague enough so that potentially millions of illegal immigrants can qualify. And now the administration has revised their guidelines to be specific enough to protect unscrupulous employers from facing legal action for knowingly hiring illegal immigrants that have applied for the amnesty program," he said.\par \par \uc2 Since July, transcript requests at Aurora Public Schools in suburban Denver jumped to 1,500, up by more than two-thirds compared to the same period last year. More than half of this year's requests are tied to the new immigration policy.\par \par \uc2 The Yakima School District in central Washington state is taking nearly a month to produce transcripts, though college applicants go to the top of the pile and have to wait only two days, said Roy Knox, director of central registration, who planned to bring in a substitute teacher to help. Before the new immigration policy, transcripts were generally a same-day service.\par \par \uc2 Some campuses in Los Angeles Unified School District battled backlogs of 200 to 300 applicants, prompting administrators to create an online form this month that funnels applications to a central location, said Lydia Ramos, a special assistant to the superintendent. The district, which put workers on overtime to catch up, anticipates spending about $200,000 on the requests, including $15,000 for postage.\par \par \uc2 The Los Angeles school board, facing a backlog of 2,300 requests, ordered administrators this month to develop a plan that cuts waiting times from up to 45 days to seven days. It estimates 50,000 requests over the next few months.\par \par \uc2 San Diego Unified School District\uc2  set up a temporary office and anticipates spending $45,000 on the effort through Dec. 14, said \uc2 Linda Zintz\uc2 , communications director. Between 80 and 100 people call or visit daily, but the office can only handle about 30 requests daily, creating waits of more than two weeks for an appointment with generally same-day service.\par \par \uc2 Abel Oregel, 29, called after attorneys for an advocacy group offered free advice on getting a permit. The opportunity comes 26 years after his parents took him across the border illegally on a mountain trek. The two-week wait for an appointment meant he wouldn't have his documents for his next meeting with the attorneys.\par \par \uc2 "They told me they were really short on staff," said Oregel, a native of Guadalajara, Mexico, who has lived in Southern California since he was 3.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writers Shannon Dininny in Yakima, Wash., and Ivan Moreno in Denver contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120925e89p001ux\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHOENIX (AP) - Larry Dever, the four-term Republican sheriff of Cochise County who was an outspoken advocate for stronger border security, has been killed in a one-vehicle crash near the northern Arizona town of Williams. He was 60.\par \par \uc2 Dever's death was confirmed early Wednesday by the sheriff's department.\par \par \uc2 Dever was driving on a dirt Forest Service road on the way to meet family members for a camping and hunting trip at White Horse Lake south of Williams when his pickup rolled, according to a news release from the Coconino County Sheriff's Office.\par \par \uc2 Another driver had been following Dever's truck Tuesday evening and told deputies he came around a corner and found a cloud of dust. The pickup had rolled but landed on its wheels. Dever was dead at the scene.\par \par \uc2 It's not clear if Dever was wearing a seat belt, but he was not ejected, Coconino County sheriff's spokesman Gerry Blair said. There was no sign Dever had been drinking.\par \par \uc2 The sheriff died just four days after his 86-year-old mother, Annie Mae Dever, died of cancer.\par \par \uc2 Dever was first elected to his post as the head of the county's law enforcement agency in 1996, and was last re-elected in 2008. He joined the agency as a deputy in 1976, according to the sheriff's department website.\par \par \uc2 He entered the national spotlight as one of Arizona's four border sheriffs who asked to legally defend the state's controversial anti-illegal immigration law, known as SB1070, in federal court. Cochise County, in the state's southeastern corner, shares an 83.5-mile border with Mexico and is one of the state's hot spots for illegal immigration and drug smuggling.\par \par \uc2 He said at the time that the federal government was failing to secure the border and praised the law, which includes provisions that require police to question a person's immigration status while enforcing other laws and if officers suspect the person is in the county illegally.\par \par \uc2 "If the federal government had been doing and would continue to do its job in securing the border here in southern Arizona, this would not be an issue. Unfortunately, they failed to do that, so Arizona stepped up and said, `We want to be partners. Here's a role we think we can play,'" Dever told The Associated Press earlier this year.\par \par \uc2 Gov. \uc2 Jan Brewer\uc2  lamented the loss of Dever and said she had known him since she was a Maricopa County Supervisor in the late 1990s.\par \par \uc2 "I'll remember him in his cowboy hat - soft-spoken and unfailingly polite, but firm in his beliefs and steady in his service to the law," Brewer said in a statement. "In the truest sense, Sheriff Dever was a Western lawman and country gentleman."\par \par \uc2 "We lost a great man last night," Chief Deputy Rodney Rothrock told The Arizona Republic. He said Dever was "one of the finest sheriffs we have ever seen."\par \par \uc2 Rothrock will be taking over Dever's responsibilities for now, according to sheriff's spokeswoman Carol Capas. Dever was running unopposed for re-election.\par \par \uc2 Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu said he was shocked and saddened at Dever's death.\par \par \uc2 "He was my friend, a leader on border security and leader among sheriffs," Babeu said in a statement. "This is a great loss to Arizona, a true patriot has died and he will be sorely missed."\par \par \uc2 It was Dever's office that investigated the 2010 death of a prominent rancher whom the sheriff said was likely killed by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . The killing spurred Arizona's political leadership, including Gov. \uc2 Jan Brewer\uc2  and its U.S. senators, to renew pressure on the Obama administration to deploy National Guard troops along the southern border.\par \par \uc2 Dever also joined other Arizona sheriffs in slamming the Obama administration over a botched federal operation that lost track of weapons sold to suspect straw purchasers for Mexican drug gangs.\par \par \uc2 "We spent a great deal of time at the border with Sheriff Dever and know firsthand his long commitment to keeping the people of our state safe," U.S. Sens. John McCain and Jon Kyl said in a joint statement. "We also admired Sheriff Dever's strength to speak out when he believed more needed to be done to secure our border. Sheriff Dever was not only a leader in Cochise County, but also across Arizona and throughout the law enforcement community. Sheriff Dever was a man of honor, integrity, and selfless service to the State of Arizona. He will be greatly missed."\par \par \uc2 Dever was born and grew up in the town of St. David. He is survived by his wife, Nancy; six sons; and 11 grandchildren.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120919e89j0014f\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 NEW ORLEANS (AP) - A Dallas suburb asked a federal appeals court Wednesday to uphold an ordinance that would ban illegal immigrants from renting homes in the town.\par \par \uc2 The full 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed to rehear the case after a three-judge panel from the court ruled in March that Farmers Branch's ordinance is unconstitutional and impermissibly interferes with the federal immigration system.\par \par \uc2 The court's 15 judges didn't indicate when they would rule after hearing arguments Wednesday from attorneys for the town and a group of landlords and tenants who sued to block the ordinance's enforcement.\par \par \uc2 Arguments largely focused on how the case is affected by a \uc2 U.S. Supreme Court\uc2  ruling in June on Arizona's tough immigration law. That ruling rejected major parts of the law, but upheld the so-called "show me your papers" requirement, which gives law enforcement authority to check a person's legal status if officers have reasonable suspicion he or she is in the U.S. illegally.\par \par \uc2 Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, a national advocate for tougher illegal immigration laws who is also representing Farmers Branch, said that provision of the Arizona law closely mirrors a key portion of the Texas town's ordinance.\par \par \uc2 "The problem with the plaintiffs' argument is that they cannot identify a single federal statute that the Farmers Branch ordinance conflicts with," he said.\par \par \uc2 The ordinance, which replaced an earlier 2006 version, would require all renters to obtain a $5 city license and fill out an application that asks about their legal status. Then, the city's building inspector would have to check whether any immigrant applying for a license was in the United States legally. Illegal immigrants would be denied a permit, and landlords who knowingly allow illegal immigrants to stay as tenants could be fined or have their renters' license barred.\par \par \uc2 Kobach said the ordinance explicitly bars the town from making its own determination about whether someone is "lawfully present" in the U.S.\par \par \uc2 "It must always be done by the federal government," he said.\par \par \uc2 "It's a yes or no from the federal government, correct?" asked Judge Jennifer Elrod, who heard the case last year but issued a dissenting opinion.\par \par \uc2 "Correct," Kobach responded.\par \par \uc2 But plaintiffs' attorney Nina Perales said the information federal officials provide the building inspector is "very complex and varied" and doesn't explicitly state whether an applicant is "lawfully present" in the country.\par \par \uc2 "That's something that the building inspector is going to have to figure out for himself," Perales said.\par \par \uc2 Fellow plaintiffs' attorney Dunham Biles added: "No one other than the federal government has the authority to classify aliens."\par \par \uc2 Perales said the city's ordinance goes far beyond the Arizona law, forcibly removing illegal immigrants from rental housing instead of merely detaining them and letting the federal government decide whether to remove them from the country.\par \par \uc2 "This is a complete divergence from the federal system," she said.\par \par \uc2 A federal district judge ruled against the city in 2010 before the three-judge panel at the 5th Circuit upheld it earlier this year.\par \par \uc2 The full 5th Circuit is generally considered to be one of the nation's most conservative federal courts. Its decision to hear the Farmers Branch case is rare -- fewer than 5 percent of petitions for a full court hearing are granted -- though the court rehearing a case doesn't necessarily mean judges intend to reverse an earlier decision.\par \par \uc2 ----\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writer Nomaan Merchant in Dallas contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120919e89j0010w\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

Its case will now go before the full membership of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, with 10 judges appointed by Republican presidents and just five by Democrats.\par \par \uc2 So far, no court has allowed Farmers Branch to enforce any form of the ordinance. But the appeals court's rare move to hear the case a second time, months after a different three-judge panel ruled against Farmers Branch, could be a sign that the town might finally get a victory.\par \par \uc2 The current ordinance, which replaced an earlier 2006 version, would require all renters to obtain a $5 city license and fill out an application that asks about their legal status. Then, the city's building inspector would have to check whether any immigrant applying for a license was in the United States legally. Illegal immigrants would be denied a permit, and landlords who knowingly allow illegal immigrants to stay as tenants could be fined or have their renters' license barred.\par \par \uc2 The appeals court has directed all sides to focus on the \uc2 U.S. Supreme Court\uc2 's June ruling on Arizona's tough immigration law. That ruling rejected major parts of the law, but upheld the so-called "show me your papers" requirement, which gives law enforcement authority to check a person's legal status if officers have reasonable suspicion he or she is in the U.S. illegally.\par \par \uc2 Farmers Branch's attorneys argue that the city's ordinance is substantially different from Arizona's law and that the \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2  didn't act to stop local officials from restricting \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  renters.\par \par \uc2 Attorneys for the landlords and renters who originally sued the town believe Farmers Branch is encroaching on legal territory reserved for federal authorities.\par \par \uc2 A federal district judge ruled against the city two years ago, and a three-judge panel at the 5th Circuit upheld that ruling in March.\par \par \uc2 Nina Perales, vice president of litigation for the Latino civil-rights group MALDEF, said she believed local officials could communicate with federal authorities on immigration matters, as long as they didn't take action on their own.\par \par \uc2 "Where the \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2  has drawn the line is where state and localities are taking unilateral adverse action against people they think are undocumented," said Perales, who will argue before the 5th Circuit on Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, a national advocate for tougher illegal immigration laws, will represent Farmers Branch before the full court, in what's known as an en banc hearing. He said Tuesday he believed the \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2  upholding the "show me your papers" requirement strengthened Farmers Branch's case.\par \par \uc2 "The fact that the en banc decision was granted in and of itself was a win for the city, getting the opportunity to make the case as to why the panel majority was wrong," Kobach said.\par \par \uc2 The full 5th Circuit is generally considered to be one of the nation's most conservative federal courts. Its decision to hear the Farmers Branch case is rare -- fewer than 5 percent of petitions for a full court hearing are granted -- though the court rehearing a case doesn't necessarily mean judges intend to reverse an earlier decision.\par \par \uc2 Based in New Orleans, the 5th Circuit hears cases from Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi, and its rulings are binding in those states only. But other circuit courts are considering laws similar to the one passed by Farmers Branch, and one circuit's opinion can be cited by attorneys elsewhere.\par \par \uc2 In August, a federal appeals court in Philadelphia heard arguments in a case from Hazleton, Pa., a former coal-mining town that also tried to ban \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  renters by requiring rental permits. The court has not yet ruled.\par \par \uc2 Farmers Branch has spent nearly $6 million on legal bills and expenses related to illegal immigration, according to a town spokesman.\par \par \uc2 Mayor Bill Glancy said in an interview that the town was not inhospitable to minorities, despite complaints from some Latinos that they feel targeted by police. Glancy pointed to English classes offered at the local library that attract dozens of people from different countries.\par \par \uc2 "They're against illegal immigration," Glancy said of his town's residents. "They have supported legal immigration for a long time."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120918e89i00217\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) - A Virginia man convicted of plotting to detonate a suicide bomb at the U.S Capitol was sentenced Friday to 30 years in prison, the maximum sentence allowed under a plea deal he struck.\par \par \uc2 Amine El-Khalifi, 29, of Alexandria expressed no remorse for his actions at Friday's sentencing hearing.\par \par \uc2 "I just want to say that I love Allah. That's it," he told U.S. District Judge James Cacheris.\par \par \uc2 He was arrested in February in a parking garage near the Capitol, wearing what he thought was an explosive-laden suicide vest. In an undercover sting, agents posing as al-Qaida operatives had supplied him with an inert explosive vest and an inoperable gun.\par \par \uc2 Under El-Khalifi's guilty plea, the judge could only sentence him to a range from 25 to 30 years.\par \par \uc2 Public defender Kenneth Troccoli argued for the minimum sentence. He said that El-Khalifi "bore no ill will to the American people."\par \par \uc2 "His motivation was simply to do what he thought God called him to do," Troccoli said.\par \par \uc2 Troccoli said his client, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Morocco, embarked on a largely self-taught rediscovery of his religion after a misdemeanor assault conviction in 2007. Before that, he had been active in the D.C. club scene, taking drugs and occasionally producing music.\par \par \uc2 On the Internet, he found videos and propaganda that reinforced extremist views.\par \par \uc2 The FBI undercover operation gave him the means and the support carry out his perceived religious obligations. El-Khalifi was unwilling to die while in financial debt, and the agents gave him $4,300 to satisfy some overdue rent. And the agents promised to provide "martyrdom payments" to his family of $500 or $1,000 per month after he carried out the suicide attack.\par \par \uc2 The agents also provided moral support to "convince him that he was right in what he was doing," Troccoli said.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutor Gordon Kromberg said El-Khalifi came to authorities' attention in 2010, in part because he answered a \uc2 Facebook\uc2  post seeking to recruit Muslim holy warriors.\par \par \uc2 Kromberg said it's fortunate that the FBI got to El-Khalifi first and set up the undercover operation; otherwise, El-Khalifi likely would have found real terrorists to help him carry out an attack.\par \par \uc2 "This was a man who was not shy about what he wanted to do," Kromberg said, noting that many of El-Khalifi's acquaintances said he frequently talked about his desire to carry out a martyrdom attack that would wipe away his past sins.\par \par \uc2 Kromberg urged the judge to impose a maximum sentence and said it should not matter that there was never any real danger that El-Khalifi could carry out an attack.\par \par \uc2 "We cannot wait until there are real, dead victims to enforce our laws," Kromberg said.\par \par \uc2 When the undercover agents first approached el-Khalifi, his initial idea was to attack an office building in Alexandria. He later suggested attacking a synagogue, a busy Washington restaurant and an Army general's home before eventually volunteering to attack the Capitol.\par \par \uc2 According to court papers, El-Khalifi detonated a test bomb at a West Virginia quarry and expressed disappointment that the explosion was not big enough. On Feb. 17, the day of the planned attack, El-Khalifi went so far as to don what he thought was a bomb-laden vest packed with nails, and carried the inoperable automatic weapon that he would use to shoot past any guards who got in his way.\par \par \uc2 El-Khalifi told the agents he would be happy if the attack killed 30 people.\par \par \uc2 El-Khalifi will be deported to Morocco after serving his sentence.\par \par \uc2 U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia Neil MacBride, whose office prosecuted the case, said Friday that "El-Khalifi sought to bring down the U.S. Capitol, one of our nation's iconic symbols. Since 9/11, our mission has been to find terrorists intent on attacking the United States before they act."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120914e89e001cl\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ATLANTA (AP) - The state of Georgia has asked a full federal appeals court to reconsider a decision on the state's tough law targeting illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 A three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last month left in place a lower court injunction that blocks part of Georgia's law making it illegal for someone to knowingly harbor or transport an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  during the commission of a crime. The panel also ruled last month that a part of the law that authorizes law enforcement to verify the immigration status of criminal suspects who fail to produce proper identification should be allowed to go into effect.\par \par \uc2 The state on Monday filed a petition asking for a full court hearing. The state wrote in its court filing that the panel's decision goes against certain 11th Circuit and \uc2 U.S. Supreme Court\uc2  decisions, including a decision in June on a challenge to a similar law in Arizona. The 11th Circuit can accept or decline the request.\par \par \uc2 American Civil Liberties Union\uc2  lawyer Omar Jadwat, who argued the case before the 11th Circuit panel, said the state's request is "a pointless attempt to postpone the harboring provision's inevitable demise."\par \par \uc2 "This mean-spirited law has failed the constitutional test at every stage of this litigation, and it is going to keep failing no matter how long the State drags out the fight," he said.\par \par \uc2 A spokeswoman for Georgia Attorney General Sam Olens said the state would have no comment beyond the petition for rehearing.\par \par \uc2 The state argued in its filing that the panel's finding that federal law preempts the state law's harboring and transporting provision "threatens to undermine the cooperative federalism found throughout state and federal criminal law."\par \par \uc2 The panel also held that the plaintiffs' private right of action to challenge the law stemmed from the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution "without performing any of the analysis required by precedents of this Court and the \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2 ," the state argued.\par \par \uc2 Georgia is one of several states that last year followed Arizona's lead in enacting strict anti-illegal immigration laws. Proponents have argued they are necessary in part because of alleged federal inaction. Opponents have argued that many of the laws are punitive to immigrants and that immigration policy must be steered by the federal government.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Follow Brumback at: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://twitter.com/katebrumback"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://twitter.com/katebrumback}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120912e89c001yb\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) - Nearly three-fourths of New Mexico voters oppose a state law that allows illegal immigrants to obtain drivers licenses, according to a new poll released Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 The poll commissioned by The Albuquerque Journal ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://bit.ly/SEh8KV"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://bit.ly/SEh8KV}}}\uc2 ) found that 71 percent of the state's likely voters, across ethnic and party lines, are against the 2003 state law; 21 percent say they support the practice while 8 percent are undecided.\par \par \uc2 The poll found that a majority of whites and Latinos, as well as voters in every region of the state, opposed the law.\par \par \uc2 A Journal Poll in 2010, before efforts to end the practice were introduced at the state Capitol, found that 72 percent of voters opposed issuing driver's licenses to illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 "The dialogue hasn't changed in the last two years, and neither has public opinion," pollster Brian Sanderoff said.\par \par \uc2 Gov. Susana Martinez, after her election in 2010, frequently cited the broad majority of voters who voiced opposition to the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  driver's licenses to defend her efforts to repeal the law during the 2011 and 2012 legislative sessions.\par \par \uc2 Martinez argued that providing illegal immigrants with driver's licenses was a public safety issue, and her administration cited instances in which out-of-state immigrants paid to be bused to New Mexico to acquire licenses using forged documents.\par \par \uc2 However, state Senate Democrats resisted repeal legislation passed by the state House in each of the past two years.\par \par \uc2 Martinez, the nation's first elected Latina governor, also faced strong opposition from immigrant advocates and various religious leaders, including Catholic Archbishop Michael Sheehan, of Santa Fe. That coalition has supported amending the law to close fraud loopholes, but Martinez and GOP lawmakers said that would not support that.\par \par \uc2 "We've had the governor making this matter one of her priorities," Sanderoff said. "With numbers like this, I suspect she'll keep bringing it up."\par \par \uc2 The issue has become a factor in state legislative races as Republican-funded political action committees have begun targeting lawmakers who opposed outright repeal for their stance on the issue, Sanderoff said.\par \par \uc2 Among voters who identified themselves as Hispanic, 62 percent said they were opposed to the law allowing driver's licenses for illegal immigrants, 34 percent said they supported the law and 8 percent were undecided\par \par \uc2 The new Journal Poll was conducted Sept. 3-6 by \uc2 Research & Polling Inc\uc2 . The poll is based on land line and cellphone interviews with voters statewide. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.9 percentage points.\par \par \uc2 Marcela Diaz, of Somos Un Pueblo Unido, a Santa Fe-based immigrant rights group who has fought repeal efforts, said other polls have shown that New Mexico voters also support amending the law and that the issue was not high on a list of voter priorities.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120912e89c0017w\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

(AP) - An FBI sting operation promised "martyrdom payments" of up to $1,000 a month to a Moroccan immigrant who eventually volunteered to kill himself in a plot to bomb the U.S. Capitol, according to court papers.\par \par \uc2 Amine El-Khalifi, 29, who was living in Alexandria as an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  until the time of his arrest in February, will be sentenced Friday in federal court in Alexandria. He pleaded guilty in June.\par \par \uc2 In court papers, El-Khalifi's lawyers said their client received more than $5,700 in living expenses from undercover FBI agents during the six-month investigation. He was also promised that his parents would receive what the lawyers describe as "martyrdom payments" of up to $1,000 a month after he completed the attack.\par \par \uc2 "Mr. El-Khalifi believed that one of his most important obligations was to care for his mother and father. Failing to do so would, again, meet with God's disapproval. Without the promise of the `martyrdom payments' to his parents, Mr. El-Khalifi would have had great difficulty completing the mission as he would have been shirking his responsibility to ensure their well-being," federal public defender Kenneth Troccoli wrote in court papers.\par \par \uc2 The martyrdom payments were to have gone to El-Khalifi's parents in Morocco. The family was in financial straits after his father was forced to close down a bazaar in Casablanca that had been a primary source of income. There was apparently some confusion about the payments, but El-Khalifi understood that each of his parents would be given $500 a month for an indefinite period of time after the suicide bombing occurred.\par \par \uc2 El-Khalifi's plea deal requires a sentence of between 25 and 30 years be imposed. The defense is seeking 25; prosecutors are asking for 30.\par \par \uc2 In its documents, the government emphasizes that El-Khalifi was a willing participant in the plot, and that El-Khalifi himself came up with the idea to attack the Capitol.\par \par \uc2 "Had the defendant not found (the undercover agents) in the fall of 2011, there is every reason to believe that he would have taken any opportunity he encountered in the future to commit mass murder," prosecutors Michael Ben'Ary and Gordon Kromberg wrote.\par \par \uc2 The defense traces el-Khalifi's change from a young adult on the D.C. club scene toward radical Islam. They say El-Khalifi's religious schooling was largely self-taught. After several years of working retail in D.C.'s Georgetown neighborhood and producing club music, he began taking drugs and in 2007 was convicted of misdemeanor assault and received a five-day jail sentence. The incident prompted El-Khalifi to re-examine his life, and his mother urged him to embrace the Quran. He embarked on what the defense says was a largely self-taught indoctrination into more extreme interpretations of the religion.\par \par \uc2 The sting operation served only to reinforce those views, Troccoli said. The undercover agents, who said they were part of al-Qaida, appeared to hold like-minded views. They urged El-Khalifi not to discuss the plot, further isolating him.\par \par \uc2 The agents, who went by the names Hussien and Yusuf, "assured him they would be with Mr. El-Khalifi every step of the way, even promising to detonate the bomb if Mr. El-Khalifi were prevented from doing so. He was made to feel part of an insular group on a mission, with a purpose," Troccoli wrote.\par \par \uc2 The defense lawyers emphasized that they do not believe the FBI actions constitute entrapment, and do not excuse El-Khalifi's conduct.\par \par \uc2 However, defense attorneys urged the judge to consider how El-Khalifi may have acted differently if, instead of being told to keep the plot secret, he was encouraged to "validate his beliefs with outsiders, for example an Imam at his mosque or a family member," the defense wrote.\par \par \uc2 The defense memo states that "Mr. El-Khalifi bears no ill-will against the American people. He is relieved that his attempted crime was foiled and that no one was actually injured."\par \par \uc2 The El-Khalifi case is one of many in the past few years in which the FBI has run sting operations targeting "homegrown terrorists." El-Khalifi's case stands out in part because he chose such a high-profile target and because he planned to kill himself in carrying out the operation. Before he was arrested, El-Khalifi had already traveled to a Capitol parking garage wearing what he thought was an explosive-laden suicide vest. The vest, provided by the undercover agents, was actually inert. A gun he planned to use to shoot his way past security was also inoperable.\par \par \uc2 It is not clear whether the FBI has promised martyrdom payments in any of the other cases. An FBI spokesman declined to comment Monday.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120910e89a002ql\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

(AP) - An \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Nigeria admitted Friday he assumed the identity of a murdered man so he could work at Newark's airport, where he was a security supervisor for 20 years. He now faces possible deportation.\par \par \uc2 Bimbo Oyewole, 54, pleaded guilty in state court to using a fake security badge under a plea deal in which prosecutors agreed to recommend he receive probation. He had been charged with identity theft when he was arrested in May.\par \par \uc2 He will be jailed pending sentencing Oct. 19. The state attorney general's office, which prosecuted the case, said Oyewole faces potential deportation.\par \par \uc2 Oyewole admitted in court that he is in the country illegally, having entered on a student visa in 1989 and stayed after it expired.\par \par \uc2 "I came in legally," Oyewole, hands cuffed behind his back, told the court.\par \par \uc2 Oyewole admitted he used the identity and identity papers of Jerry Thomas, who was shot outside a Queens, N.Y., YMCA in 1992.\par \par \uc2 Authorities had said Oyewole assumed Thomas's identity weeks before he died. Police in New York said Thomas had sold his documents to a Nigerian cab driver, who then sold them to Oyewole. They said they had no evidence tying Oyewole to Thomas' death.\par \par \uc2 Oyewole said he presented Thomas' birth certificate and Social Security card to airport officials. He then received ID cards that give airport workers security clearance.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors said Oyewole also obtained a New Jersey driver's license and high school equivalency diploma under Thomas' name.\par \par \uc2 The Port Authority, which operates Newark Liberty International Airport, said Oyewole most recently worked for \uc2 FJC Security Services\uc2 , a contractor that staffs access gates and had access to airplanes and the tarmac. He supervised about 30 guards.\par \par \uc2 Port Authority officials were alerted to Oyewole after receiving an anonymous letter about him.\par \par \uc2 "Today's conviction will serve notice to all that the Port Authority of NY and NJ will not tolerate fraud or any other criminal misconduct at its facilities," Port Authority Inspector General Robert E.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 EL PASO, Texas (AP) - The FBI and Border Patrol are investigating after the Mexican government said a Mexican citizen was killed when a U.S. agent patrolling the Rio Grande fired his weapon across the border, a Border Patrol spokesman said Thursday.\par \par \uc2 Border agents were aboard a boat near Laredo when a group of people began throwing rocks at them Monday, Border Patrol spokesman Bill Brooks said. One of the agents fired shots across the border toward Nuevo Laredo.\par \par \uc2 Brooks said it wasn't immediately clear to the agents whether anyone was hit by the bullets. Mexico's Foreign Relations Department issued a statement Wednesday saying a Mexican citizen had been fatally shot.\par \par \uc2 FBI spokesman Erick Vasys said his agency is investigating the rock-throwing as an attack on federal officers, while the shooting will be part of an internal review by the Border Patrol.\par \par \uc2 "We normally and regularly open investigations when a federal officer is assaulted," Vasys said. "Especially if gunfire is involved."\par \par \uc2 The Mexican foreign relations department's statement protested the use of what it called disproportionate force in immigration control and demanded thorough investigation of the incident. Ricardo Alday, spokesman at the Mexican embassy in Washington, said the Mexican government still is gathering information on the case and also expects to get the results of the investigations by U.S. authorities.\par \par \uc2 Border agents are generally allowed to use lethal force against rock throwers.\par \par \uc2 In 2010, a 15-year-old boy was killed by bullets fired by a U.S. Border Patrol agent from El Paso, Texas, into Juarez, Mexico. Some witnesses said people on the Mexican side of the river, including the teen, were throwing rocks at the agent as he tried to arrest an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  crossing the Rio Grande.\par \par \uc2 Senior U.S. District Judge David Briones in El Paso last year dismissed a lawsuit by the family of the boy because the teen was on the Mexican side of the Rio Grande when he was shot. U.S. law gives the government immunity when such claims arise in a foreign country, Briones noted, and the "harm that the Plaintiffs allege ... was felt in Mexico."\par \par \uc2 A \uc2 U.S. Department of Justice\uc2  investigation, which included interviews with more than 25 civilian and law-enforcement witnesses, determined no federal civil rights charges could be pursued because "accident, mistake, misperception, negligence and bad judgment were not sufficient to establish a federal criminal civil rights violation."\par \par \uc2 "This review took into account evidence indicating that the agent's actions constituted a reasonable use of force or would constitute an act of self-defense in response to the threat created by a group of smugglers hurling rocks at the agent and his detainee," the department said.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120906e8960028l\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 LOS ANGELES (AP) - A California printer supply manufacturer raided by federal authorities four years ago has agreed to plead guilty to employing illegal immigrants and pay $267,000 in fines.\par \par \uc2 Wazana Brothers International\uc2  -- also known as Micro Solutions Enterprises -- has reached a proposed plea deal with federal prosecutors that includes a sentence of three years' probation and a compliance program for employing 55 illegal immigrants, court papers show.\par \par \uc2 Company president \uc2 Yoel Wazana\uc2  has agreed to plead guilty to aiding and abetting the false representation of a Social Security number by a worker, federal prosecutors said. The deal still must be approved by a judge.\par \par \uc2 Not guilty pleas were automatically entered in federal court Wednesday for Wazana and the company, but will be changed at a later date in line with the plea deal, said Thom Mrozek, a spokesman for the US attorney's office.\par \par \uc2 The charges come four years after federal immigration agents raided the Van Nuys company and arrested about 130 workers on suspicion of being in the country illegally. Eight workers were criminally charged at the time with providing fraudulent information -- but charges against the company and its president were filed just last month.\par \par \uc2 "We have identified and successfully targeted those responsible for employing an illegal workforce," said Claude Arnold, special agent in charge of Immigration and Customs Enforcement's homeland security investigations in Los Angeles. "That's the way we will deter companies and individuals running the companies from engaging in that behavior."\par \par \uc2 In recent years, the Obama administration has stepped up company audits and arrests of managers while rounding up fewer \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  workers for deportation in worksite operations. In the last fiscal year, Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested more than 200 managers -- more than twice the number of four years earlier -- while the number of illegal immigrants arrested during worksite enforcement efforts fell to 1,471 from 4,077, agency statistics show.\par \par \uc2 Company attorney \uc2 Peter Schey\uc2  said Wazana acknowledges its negligence five years ago when it disregarded some workers' immigration status and is committed to full compliance with the law.\par \par \uc2 "These errors were corrected long ago and changes in procedures will preclude them from happening again," Schey said.\par \par \uc2 In 2007, immigration agents asked to review the company's payroll, employee certification list and employment eligibility paperwork. The company then moved dozens of workers to another manufacturer's production line and reported only some of them -- not all -- to federal authorities, according to court papers.\par \par \uc2 After the February 2008 raid, dozens of the arrested workers fought federal government efforts to deport them, arguing that immigration agents had no right to detain them.\par \par \uc2 Some won their cases in immigration court but have since lost on appeal and now face deportation, said Ahilan Arulanantham, deputy legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California, which is representing a handful of cases and advising on others.\par \par \uc2 Arulanantham said he believes the penalties faced by the company pale in comparison to the prospect of deportation for a worker.\par \par \uc2 "The Obama administration appears to have recognized it is cheaper and more humane to target employers but they persist in wasting judicial resources trying to deport the workers arrested in the Van Nuys raid," he said.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120906e896000md\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The deal still must be approved by a judge.\par \par \uc2 The charges come four years after federal immigration agents raided the Van Nuys company and arrested about 130 workers on suspicion of being in the country illegally. Eight workers were criminally charged at the time with providing fraudulent information -- but charges against the company and its president were filed just last month.\par \par \uc2 "We have identified and successfully targeted those responsible for employing an illegal workforce," said Claude Arnold, special agent in charge of Immigration and Customs Enforcement's homeland security investigations in Los Angeles. "That's the way we will deter companies and individuals running the companies from engaging in that behavior."\par \par \uc2 In recent years, the Obama administration has stepped up company audits and arrests of managers while rounding up fewer \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  workers for deportation in worksite operations. In the last fiscal year, Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested more than 200 managers -- more than twice the number of four years earlier -- while the number of illegal immigrants arrested during worksite enforcement efforts fell to 1,471 from 4,077, agency statistics show.\par \par \uc2 Company attorney \uc2 Peter Schey\uc2  said Wazana acknowledges its negligence five years ago when it disregarded some workers' immigration status and is committed to full compliance with the law.\par \par \uc2 "These errors were corrected long ago and changes in procedures will preclude them from happening again," Schey said.\par \par \uc2 Immigration agents began investigating the Van Nuys company in 2007 and asked to review the company's payroll, employee certification list and employment eligibility paperwork. The company then moved dozens of workers to another manufacturer's production line and reported only some of them -- not all -- to federal authorities, according to court papers.\par \par \uc2 After the February 2008 raid, dozens of the arrested workers fought federal government efforts to deport them, arguing that immigration agents had no right to detain them.\par \par \uc2 Some won their cases in immigration court but have since lost on appeal and now face deportation, said Ahilan Arulanantham, deputy legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California, which is representing a handful of cases and advising on others.\par \par \uc2 Arulanantham said he believes the penalties faced by the company pale in comparison to the prospect of deportation for a worker.\par \par \uc2 "The Obama administration appears to have recognized it is cheaper and more humane to target employers but they persist in wasting judicial resources trying to deport the workers arrested in the Van Nuys raid," he said.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120905e895001we\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 MIAMI (AP) - Students at Florida's public colleges and universities cannot be charged higher out-of-state tuition simply because their parents are in the U.S. illegally, a federal judge ruled.\par \par \uc2 U.S. District Judge K. Michael Moore determined the policy violates the equal protection clause of the Constitution by forcing those students to unfairly pay three times as much as Florida residents. Children born in this country are citizens whether or not their parents have legal immigration status.\par \par \uc2 "The state regulations deny a benefit and create unique obstacles to attain public post-secondary public education for U.S. citizen children who would otherwise qualify for in-state tuition," Moore wrote.\par \par \uc2 The ruling Friday came in a lawsuit filed by the Montgomery, Ala.-based Southern Poverty Law Center on behalf of several Florida students who were denied in-state tuition because they could not prove their parents are in this country legally. The center's deputy legal director, Jerri Katzerman, said Tuesday that Moore's ruling could give thousands of students greater access to an education.\par \par \uc2 "He has said in no uncertain terms that these youngsters are citizens and they have been discriminated against," she said.\par \par \uc2 State education officials said lawyers were reviewing the ruling and no decision had been made on a possible appeal. There are 28 public two-year colleges -- most of which also offer a limited number of four-year degrees -- and 11 public four-year universities in Florida.\par \par \uc2 At the state's flagship University of Florida, in-state tuition costs about $205 per credit hour. For those paying out-of-state tuition, the price balloons to $947 per hour, according to the State University System of Florida.\par \par \uc2 Children of illegal immigrants have won similar battles in other states.\par \par \uc2 Last month in New Jersey, a state appeals court ruled that an American-born student whose parents could not prove legal status was wrongly denied financial aid. The \uc2 American Civil Liberties Union\uc2  said that ruling could affect thousands of New Jersey students seeking state assistance to attend college.\par \par \uc2 In California, a challenge was resolved in favor of the students. Similarly, the Colorado attorney general issued an opinion in 2007 determining that legal state residents were eligible for in-state tuition even if their parents were residing in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 The Florida policy, which has been in effect for several years, applies to students under age 24 who are also claimed as dependents by parents. According to a \uc2 Florida International University\uc2  law professor's analysis of U.S Census figures, nearly 9,000 children of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  parents are enrolled in Florida public colleges and universities in a given year.\par \par \uc2 It wasn't immediately clear Tuesday how many current students might have their residency status and tuition costs changed because of the ruling.\par \par \uc2 Attorneys for the state argued mainly that classifying children of illegal immigrants as eligible for in-state tuition would cost financially-strapped colleges and universities millions of dollars each year. That argument, however, assumed Florida would be forced to offer in-state tuition to all students who lived out of state.\par \par \uc2 "This is simply incorrect," Moore wrote, adding that his ruling "would not prevent the state from continuing to distinguish between in-state residents and out-of-state non-residents."\par \par \uc2 Moore also noted that undocumented parents help pay for education through state sales and other taxes just as do parents who are U.S. citizens.\par \par \uc2 State Rep. Hazelle Rogers, a Lauderhill Democrat who sponsored legislation to scrap the policy, said the ruling comes as welcome news.\par \par \uc2 "The bottom line is simple: a U.S. citizen should be treated like a U.S. citizen no matter who their parents are," Rogers said.\par \par \uc2 New pathways to work and education have recently been opened at the federal level for young people who are in the U.S. illegally.\par \par \uc2 Earlier this year, President Barack Obama's administration expanded the rights of more than 1 million young illegal immigrants by giving them work permits even though they would not obtain legal residency here or a path to citizenship.\par \par \uc2 The immigrants must prove they arrived in the United States before they turned 16, are 30 or younger, have been living in the country at least five years and are in school or graduated or served in the military. They cannot have been convicted of certain crimes or otherwise pose a safety threat.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Follow Curt Anderson on Twitter: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://twitter.com/Miamicurt"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://twitter.com/Miamicurt}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120904e89400255\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SEATTLE (AP) - With the federal government giving young illegal immigrants brought to the U.S. as children a chance to stay in the country, advocates in Washington state are relaunching efforts to open state financial aid to college students who don't have documents.\par \par \uc2 "Now these kids can live and work here without fear of deportation," said Ricardo Sanchez, chairman of the Latino/a Educational Achievement Project, the main group behind the effort. "The financial aid makes more sense."\par \par \uc2 But Sanchez faces an uphill battle in Olympia.\par \par \uc2 The state's financial aid pot -- the needs grant program -- is already strained after years of economic woes and rising tuition costs. Despite lawmakers providing additional money, more students who qualify aren't getting aid because demand keeps growing.\par \par \uc2 More so, state financial aid is often tied with federal aid, something that students who qualify under the program can't apply for.\par \par \uc2 Add the reluctance by lawmakers, including conservatives ones, and opposition from some constituents to give financial aid to students who entered the country without proper documentation.\par \par \uc2 "The state is in the hole by significant amounts of money. We're gonna give significant resources to people who I think were given illegally a legal status," said Bob West, chairman of Grassroots of Yakima Valley, a tea party group that started as an organization to lobby for strict immigration enforcement in Olympia.\par \par \uc2 West, who three years ago testified against a similar bill, said that expanding the eligibility would act as further encouragement for immigrants to come to the country away from official channels.\par \par \uc2 "I realize that families come here and come here with small children, who are obviously not making the choice," said Craig Fisher, another member of West's group. "They come here to have a better life, if they come here for that and if the children and the children are benefited, that's another incentive for the parents. I think it's better if we approach it for the standpoint of legal immigration."\par \par \uc2 In June, President Barack Obama's administration announced that young illegal immigrants brought to the United States as children are able to apply for two-year permissions to stay in the country if they meet certain requirements.\par \par \uc2 The Obama administration's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals could expand the rights of more than 1 million young illegal immigrants nationwide. They are able to apply for work permits as well, though they don't obtain legal residency here or a path to citizenship. Under the rules, people who qualify for the program can also be current students.\par \par \uc2 Dovetailing with the new program, Sanchez plans to lead an effort to get a measure passed in Olympia during the next legislative session that would make young illegal immigrants eligible for state financial aid. He tried in 2009, but the measure didn't make it past committees controlled by Democrats.\par \par \uc2 Sanchez said the amount money that the new allocation would increase is small compared to the overall pot.\par \par \uc2 Sanchez argued that these students and their parents have contributed their share to Washington's economy. They pay taxes -- the chief source of income for the state's general budget. And many of the students who would benefit are children of agricultural workers, who help maintain one of the state's chief economic sectors.\par \par \uc2 "What's at stake is giving kids hope," Sanchez said. "Often times for any child in poverty, they don't understand what higher education means or what it costs, it's especially true for undocumented students, especially for their parents who don't have the slightest clue. If kids grow up saying to themselves, I'm not going to college because I'm an illegal alien ... it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy."\par \par \uc2 Students who are illegal immigrants already qualify for in-state tuition.\par \par \uc2 The state estimated in 2009 that making illegal immigrants who are students illegible for financial aid would cost about $7 million by the 2011-2013 budget cycle. State analysts assumed the change in eligibility would add more than 1,000 students statewide in any given year.\par \par \uc2 But Rachelle Sharpe, director of financial aid at the Washington Student Achievement Council, said it's really not known how many students who are illegal immigrants are in the state, much less if they would apply for college.\par \par \uc2 Those estimates, she said, were given to provide lawmakers an idea of increment.\par \par \uc2 Should the bill pass, the added students would likely be absorbed into the already growing demand for state financial aid. Even if eligibility is expanded to these students, it's not guaranteed they would receive aid.\par \par \uc2 Only 2 percent of all students who receive state grants only get state money, she said.\par \par \uc2 Students who qualify for the program cannot apply for federal student aid, said U.S. Department of Education spokesman Justin Hamilton.\par \par \uc2 In 2011-2012, the state needs-grant pot was $266 million, according to the Washington Student Achievement Council. The agency estimated that it number would increase to more than $300 million in the following year.\par \par \uc2 About 74,000 students received the state needs grant, but more than 31,000 who were eligible did not receive funding in the 2011-2012 school year, the agency reported.\par \par \uc2 Sen. Phyllis Gutierrez Kenney, a Democrat from Seattle, said there seems to be more support in the senate this year, which would be a bigger hurdle to pass than the lower chamber, if the current Democrat-Republic split holds.\par \par \uc2 "We want to see more kids graduate from high school," Kenney said.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Manuel Valdes can be reached at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://twitter.com/ByManuelValdes"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://twitter.com/ByManuelValdes}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120903e893001lh\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 HYATTSVILLE, Md. (AP) - Gay and lesbian advocates teamed up with Maryland's largest Latino and immigrant rights group on Tuesday, hoping to build support for two November ballot questions: one to allow same-sex marriage and another offering in-state tuition for illegal immigrants who have attended a Maryland high school and whose parents have paid taxes.\par \par \uc2 Equality Maryland, the state's gay and lesbian civil rights group, and Casa de Maryland, held a news conference at Casa's headquarters in Hyattsville with gay immigrants to announce the partnership.\par \par \uc2 Sen. Richard Madaleno, an openly gay Montgomery County lawmaker, said it's a natural alliance because the measures share the same fundamental reasons for support.\par \par \uc2 "It's about fairness, and equality and justice," Madaleno, a Democrat, said in an interview after the news conference. "It's about hope, dignity and opportunity and personal responsibility, because an education is about your ability to go out and get that education. No one gives it to you. You have to earn that diploma. Marriage is about personal responsibility. These are potentially the two most important aspects of someone's life."\par \par \uc2 Gustavo Torres, executive director of Casa, said the two groups are coming together to show a united front on two important civil rights issues. He also noted that there are immigrants who are gay.\par \par \uc2 "For us, it's an issue of families, because familia es familia," Torres said. "We are going to demonstrate that the Latino and immigrant community strongly support both referendums in November 6."\par \par \uc2 Ivette Roman, a 20-year-old undocumented immigrant from Peru who is a lesbian, said she has worked hard in school since coming to the United States when she was 10, but she has had trouble finding a way to afford higher education since graduating from Northwood High School in Silver Spring in 2011. Roman said she can't get financial aid because she is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , even though she has lived in this country for about 10 years.\par \par \uc2 "I'm trying to save up money so that I can attend \uc2 Montgomery College\uc2 ," Roman said.\par \par \uc2 Lawmakers passed a same-sex marriage measure this year. The tuition bill was passed last year. Gov. \uc2 Martin O'Malley\uc2 , a Democrat, has signed both measures. However, opponents of the two measures gathered enough signatures to put them on the ballot for voters to decide.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120828e88s001so\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc56}{\*\bkmkend toc56}\b \uc2 Special visa program offers citizenship path for \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  youth in foster care\b0\par\par\uc2 By ASHLEY HOPKINSON   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 1,061 \uc2 words\par \uc2 25 August 2012\par 13:44\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2012.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 CUMMING, Ga. (AP) - Maria Boudet has no memory of Mexico or how she came to the United States. What she does remember is the year she turned 16 and found out she was living in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 Two years ago, her mother was deported, her brother was detained and she was put in foster care. A powerful reminder of all she lost and gained is printed on the top right corner of her green card: "SL6." That's the code for special immigrant juvenile status (SIJS), the little-known program that allows Boudet and hundreds like her each year to live and work in the U.S. as a legal permanent resident.\par \par \uc2 "Everything happens for a reason," said Boudet, now 18. "You can take the negative stuff and turn it into positive stuff and there is a good lesson in that."\par \par \uc2 The program has quietly helped 10,000 young illegal immigrants become legal permanent residents since 1997. It has long been overshadowed by fiery debates over illegal immigration and strict crackdowns passed in Arizona, Utah, Georgia and Alabama. More recently, much attention has been focused on President Barack Obama's deferred action policy that allows some young illegal immigrants to avoid deportation by obtaining temporary work permits. Thousands flocked to apply for that program on the first day alone.\par \par \uc2 Advocates say that the new Obama administration policy won't directly change the juvenile visa program, and that it's too soon to tell exactly how the visa program may be affected by the policy change. But it may make young illegal immigrants more comfortable coming forward for help staying in the U.S. That could lead to more people applying for the visa. The policy change also gives them another option if they don't qualify for the special visa program because of key requirements to be under the age of 21, unmarried and a dependent of the state at the time of the application.\par \par \uc2 "In many cases SIJS would be preferable but if there is an opportunity to reunite a child with a parent this is obviously a better solution than aging out of the system," said Wendy Cervantes, vice president of immigration and child rights policy for First Focus about deferred action.\par \par \uc2 The visa program is permanent and has been for more than 20 years -- and unlike Obama's policy change, it can't be overturned. Some fear \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2  may reverse the Obama policy if he wins the November election.\par \par \uc2 It's estimated that millions of illegal immigrants live in the U.S. In the last decade, Immigration and Customs Enforcement has deported more than 32,000 illegal immigrants younger than 18, according to data provided by federal officials. Still fewer than 700 illegal immigrants receive the specific status each year.\par \par \uc2 "We see a lot more kids who come through here than are eligible," said Jessica Daman, staff attorney at the Latin American Association. The Atlanta-based advocacy group handles about 30 to 40 SIJS cases a year in Georgia.\par \par \uc2 SIJS will continue to be a needed option for young illegal immigrants for one key reason: It's permanent. The special visa can be revoked if the person commits a serious crime, though federal officials do not track how many people have had it taken away.\par \par \uc2 The visa is geared toward dependents of the state who wind up in foster care and have no chance of being reunited with relatives for reasons including abuse, abandonment or neglect. Those under certain guardianships or custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement may also qualify.\par \par \uc2 But the program remains a complicated piece of federal immigration law, and immigration attorneys like Rebeca Salmon say they have worked for years to spread the word among their clients, fellow attorneys and judges.\par \par \uc2 Since 2007, Salmon has trained officials about the visa program and said cases are more likely to be approved when judges and other officials are familiar with it.\par \par \uc2 "It's made a big difference," said Salmon, who is based in Atlanta. "When I start doing this in 2007 they really weren't getting approved and as we started doing more, more went through not because people became more friendly but they became more educated."\par \par \uc2 In Georgia, Catholic Charities handles roughly 50 to 60 SIJS cases each year, said director Jennifer Bensman. Most are teens who fled poverty and gang violence in Central America, she said. Some are children who for various reasons are left without a guardian and are placed in foster care.\par \par \uc2 Of the roughly 7,600 children in state custody in Georgia, only 56 are of "undetermined status" -- meaning the state has no records to prove they are in the country legally, according to Ravae Graham, a spokeswoman for the Department of Human Services Division. State officials must make a case for whether it's in the child's best interest to be reunited with relatives or to stay in the U.S. A judge then makes a decision on that matter, and the final decision on whether to grant a visa is then made by \uc2 United States Citizenship and Immigration Services\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Judges have one decision to make for all children, Salmon said, just as a judge had to decide for Boudet: What is in the child's best interest?\par \par \uc2 Boudet's mother was deported for working illegally. Once child welfare found out Boudet was living in her home alone, she was put in foster care. Boudet said she talks with her mom occasionally by phone, but has no plans to move to Mexico. She has been in the U.S. since she was four.\par \par \uc2 Boudet now lives with her foster family and plans to get her high school diploma, finish cosmetology school and become a celebrity stylist. She occasionally thinks of what life could have been like, but she knows her visa gives her opportunities she might not have had otherwise.\par \par \uc2 "You do have those times where you are sad and you say, `Oh, I wish my mom was here.' But she's not, and when I start thinking sad, I kind of shut myself down and," she said, her voice trailing off. "I really don't know how I would have been in Mexico. I don't know."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120825e88p001zd\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 BOSTON (AP) - A small private liberal arts college in western Massachusetts has announced the establishment of a scholarship fund dedicated to helping illegal immigrants get degrees.\par \par \uc2 The scholarship will provide more than $25,000 each year to help an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  pay for the $43,000-plus tuition at Hampshire College in Amherst. At current funding levels, the endowment will help support one student's studies at the college every four years, said college spokeswoman Elaine Thomas.\par \par \uc2 A professor was inspired to create the fund following a student's senior project on the Development, Relief, Education for Alien Minors act, which would allow some illegal immigrants to achieve U.S. citizenship by getting college degrees or by serving in the military. The legislation has yet to pass in Congress.\par \par \uc2 Hampshire alumni, graduating students, parents and other donors have given more than $300,000 since the spring to fund the scholarship and an endowment to sustain it.\par \par \uc2 There are an estimated 65,000 illegal immigrants who graduate from American high schools each year. Of those, an estimated 5 to 10 percent apply for college.\par \par \uc2 No state or federal laws prohibit the admission of illegal immigrants into U.S. colleges, but schools have varying admission policies.\par \par \uc2 Many states treat illegal immigrants as international students, charging them hefty out-of-state tuition regardless of whether they were raised in the state.\par \par \uc2 Only California, New Mexico and Texas allow illegal immigrants to receive state financial aid, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Illinois has a privately-funded scholarship endowment for these students, according to the group. There are also some private scholarships that openly welcome \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  applicants and others get financial help from merit-based scholarships.\par \par \uc2 Margaret Cerullo, the sociology professor who spearheaded the scholarship, has called the barriers blocking illegal immigrants' access to a college education a "social injustice."\par \par \uc2 "For a lot of us, access to higher education is a deep principle," Cerullo said in a statement last month.\par \par \uc2 Thomas said Hampshire College hopes to grow the size of the endowment to be able to help more immigrants. She would not identify the student who has received the award for the school year beginning this fall, citing federal education privacy rules.\par \par \uc2 Justin Draeger, the president and chief executive officer of the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators, praised states, schools and scholarship funds that recognize this population of students didn't come to the country by choice. Most were illegally brought to the country as young children or infants.\par \par \uc2 "There are a lot of kids who are U.S. citizens who have barriers to higher education," he said. "These students have these barriers and more."\par \par \uc2 Both the University of California Berkeley and University of California Los Angeles have offered scholarships specifically for illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Eva Millona, the executive director if the Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Coalition, said this is the first instance where she has heard of a Massachusetts college or university offering a specific scholarship to illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 "We're thrilled to hear this and we commend them for this generous effort," she said.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120824e88o0014z\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

Phil Bryant is ordering state agencies not to provide public benefits to immigrants receiving deferred deportation status from the federal government -- an order that reinforces current state law.\par \par \uc2 Legislators, meanwhile, held a lengthy public hearing Thursday about whether Mississippi should enact a new law allowing law officers to check people's immigration status during traffic stops or other encounters, similar to laws in Arizona and Alabama.\par \par \uc2 The House Judiciary B Committee met for more than four hours and heard a wide range of opinions. Chairman Andy Gipson, R-Braxton, said the group might meet again before the 2013 session begins in January.\par \par \uc2 Maria Mazy, 19, told lawmakers she was born in Mexico and has lived in the United States for several years, graduating in 2011 from Clinton High School outside Jackson. She also became a U.S. citizen last year. She said she worries a state enforcement law would frighten immigrants, including some of her friends.\par \par \uc2 "It will destroy the peace and tranquility that me and my family now enjoy," said Mazy, now a community college student.\par \par \uc2 Thomas Ray Floyd, owner of a small construction firm in central Mississippi, said he finds himself at a competitive disadvantage because other firms hire workers who are in the U.S. illegally and pay them substandard wages. He said he's against checkpoints and he doesn't want to deprive people of their God-given rights, but he wants state officials to do something.\par \par \uc2 "I run a legal and ethical business," Floyd said.\par \par \uc2 Bryant, a Republican, issued an executive order hours before the committee met. He has received support from tea party groups for years by saying he wants to tighten immigration enforcement because he believes the federal government has done a poor job.\par \par \uc2 President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  recently issued an executive order that defers deportation for immigrants who are 30 or younger and entered the U.S. before they were 16. Such immigrants can apply for work permits.\par \par \uc2 Arizona's Republican governor, \uc2 Jan Brewer\uc2 , signed an executive order Aug. 15, the day Obama's order took effect, telling state agencies not to give driver's licenses or other benefits to illegal immigrants who obtain work authorizations under the deferred status. Arizona already has one of the toughest immigration-enforcement laws in the country, and Bryant has cited it as a model of what he'd like to see in Mississippi.\par \par \uc2 "Illegal immigration has real consequences for Mississippi, as it puts additional burdens on our already stretched budget," Bryant said in a news release. "This executive order will help ensure that public benefits go to only those persons who are lawfully eligible."\par \par \uc2 He said the executive order "does not change or modify Mississippi law," which already bans state agencies from providing unemployment payments, food stamps or other benefits to people who are in the United States illegally.\par \par \uc2 Bill Chandler, executive director of the Mississippi Immigrants Rights Alliance, said Bryant's executive order might eventually be challenged in court. The \uc2 U.S. Department of Homeland Security\uc2  said earlier this month that each state could determine whether to issue driver's licenses or extend benefits such as in-state tuition to immigrants who are granted deferred status.\par \par \uc2 "Gov. Bryant has built his political career around inciting hatred toward immigrants, particularly Latinos. ... I think that the governor is way out of line," Chandler said. "Apparently, he thinks there is a horde of Latinos who may be descending on work places in Mississippi."\par \par \uc2 Chandler said many young immigrants have grown up in Mississippi, attending local schools and taking part in the local culture.\par \par \uc2 It was not immediately clear how many people have applied for deferred status in Mississippi, although Chandler said he thinks at least 2,000 might be eligible. The state has seen an increase in the past decade of Hispanic immigrants working at poultry plants, electronics businesses and in construction. Tens of thousands of people nationwide stood in line to seek deferred status on Aug. 15, the first day applications could be made.\par \par \uc2 Republicans hold majorities in the Mississippi House and Senate. During the 2012 session, the House passed an immigration-enforcement bill but a Democratic chairman, Hob Bryan of Amory, killed the bill by choosing not to bring it up for debate in the Senate Judiciary B Committee. Bryan said the bill attempted to micromanage the way law-enforcement officers do their jobs.\par \par \uc2 The bill would've required police or deputies to report to \uc2 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2  every time they arrest someone they suspect of being in the country illegally. Law-enforcement departments that don't comply could be fined up to $5,000 per day. The bill also would've prohibited any \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from applying for a driver's license or business license.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120824e88o00015\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 BOSTON (AP) - A small private liberal arts college in western Massachusetts has announced the establishment of a scholarship fund dedicated to helping illegal immigrants get degrees.\par \par \uc2 The scholarship will provide more than $25,000 each year to help an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  pay for the $43,000-plus tuition at Hampshire College in Amherst. At current funding levels, the endowment will help support one student's studies at the college every four years, said college spokeswoman Elaine Thomas.\par \par \uc2 A professor was inspired to create the fund following a student's senior project on the Development, Relief, Education for Alien Minors act, which would allow some illegal immigrants to achieve U.S. citizenship by getting college degrees or by serving in the military. The legislation has yet to pass in Congress.\par \par \uc2 Hampshire alumni, graduating students, parents and other donors have given more than $300,000 since the spring to fund the scholarship and an endowment to sustain it.\par \par \uc2 There are an estimated 65,000 illegal immigrants who graduate from American high schools each year. Of those, an estimated 5 to 10 percent apply for college.\par \par \uc2 No state or federal laws prohibit the admission of illegal immigrants into U.S. colleges, but schools have varying admission policies.\par \par \uc2 Many states treat illegal immigrants as international students, charging them hefty out-of-state tuition regardless of whether they were raised in the state.\par \par \uc2 Only California, New Mexico and Texas allow illegal immigrants to receive state financial aid, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Illinois has a privately-funded scholarship endowment for these students, according to the group. There are also some private scholarships that openly welcome \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  applicants and others get financial help from merit-based scholarships.\par \par \uc2 Margaret Cerullo, the sociology professor who spearheaded the scholarship, has called the barriers blocking illegal immigrants' access to a college education a "social injustice."\par \par \uc2 "For a lot of us, access to higher education is a deep principle," Cerullo said in a statement last month.\par \par \uc2 Thomas said Hampshire College hopes to grow the size of the endowment to be able to help more immigrants. She would not identify the student who has received the award for the school year beginning this fall, citing federal education privacy rules.\par \par \uc2 Justin Draeger, the president and chief executive officer of the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators, praised states, schools and scholarship funds that recognize this population of students didn't come to the country by choice. Most were illegally brought to the country as young children or infants.\par \par \uc2 "There are a lot of kids who are U.S. citizens who have barriers to higher education," he said. "These students have these barriers and more."\par \par \uc2 Both the University of California Berkeley and University of California Los Angeles have offered scholarships specifically for illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Eva Millona, the executive director if the Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Coalition, said this is the first instance where she has heard of a Massachusetts college or university offering a specific scholarship to illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 "We're thrilled to hear this and we commend them for this generous effort," she said.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120823e88n0020c\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - Nashville Sheriff Daron Hall said on Tuesday that he will not renew a controversial agreement that allows local deputies to enforce federal immigration law, replacing it with a program in which the fingerprints of detainees are sent electronically to federal agents who can check immigration status.\par \par \uc2 In April 2007, Davidson County became one of the first communities to enroll in the 287(g) program. Hall applied to participate in 2006, after an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  killed two people while driving drunk. The case became a campaign issue during the gubernatorial race when it was revealed that the man had been arrested at least 14 times.\par \par \uc2 "The community was blaming me for letting people go who were illegally in the country," Hall said during a Tuesday news conference, explaining that at the time he had no way of knowing the immigration status of inmates.\par \par \uc2 Immigrant rights activists initially hoped the 287(g) program would target only violent criminals for deportation, but it quickly became a point of controversy when it started ensnaring many people for misdemeanors, such as driving without a license. Activists also charged that the program encouraged racial profiling and led to mistrust between illegal immigrants and police.\par \par \uc2 One of those caught by the program was Mercedes Gonzalez, a teenager arrested last year, one week before her high school graduation, for speeding and driving without a license. Federal officials agreed not to deport her after other students and concerned citizens rallied to her cause.\par \par \uc2 Gonzalez, who is now 19 and was brought to the U.S. by her parents at age 11, attended Hall's announcement on Tuesday. She said she was glad 287(g) will end but concerned that the new program, Secure Communities, will continue to place people in deportation for minor offenses.\par \par \uc2 "I'm actually still terrified about the police," Gonzalez said.\par \par \uc2 Hall painted a different picture of the program.\par \par \uc2 "I believe its success is the reason we can sit here today and say it is no longer needed," he said.\par \par \uc2 Since 2007, there has been an 80 percent decrease in the number of arrestees in Nashville who are illegally in the country, Hall said. He attributed much of the decline to the program, although he said he could not be sure how much of it was due to the overall nationwide decline in illegal immigration in recent years.\par \par \uc2 Hall's participation in 287(g) is currently the subject of a federal lawsuit that claims the sheriff's department is exceeding the authority given to it by Metro Nashville's charter. When Davidson County formed a metropolitan government 50 years ago, all law enforcement duties were given to the police department while the sheriff's office was left the responsibility of running the jail.\par \par \uc2 The suit only targets 287(g) but it has shone a light on other sheriff's department activities that might not be specifically authorized by the charter, such as serving warrants on people in the jail. Because of this, Metro's Law Department is proposing a charter amendment that would clarify the expanded duties of the sheriff's department. The move has widely been seen as a response to the 287(g) lawsuit.\par \par \uc2 On Tuesday, Hall said the charter amendment is completely separate and will move forward despite the department dropping out of the 287(g) program.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 BOSTON (AP) - Milford, Mass. on Monday became the first town in New England to partner with federal immigration officials in a program aimed at preventing the hiring of illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Under the voluntary program known as IMAGE -- ICE Mutual Agreement between Government and Employers -- companies and municipalities are given education and training in proper hiring procedures, fraudulent document detection and the use of employment screening tools such as E-Verify. Certified employers also undergo an audit to ensure current employees are authorized to work in the United States.\par \par \uc2 Officials from Milford and \uc2 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2  signed the agreement Monday night at Milford's Board of Selectmen meeting.\par \par \uc2 "The newly formed partnership with ICE and the Town of Milford underscores this town's commitment to protecting the integrity of their workforce and to foster best hiring practices," Bruce Foucart, special agent in charge of ICE's Homeland Security Investigations in Boston, said in a press release.\par \par \uc2 "I am hopeful that other municipalities and companies will follow the actions that Milford has taken," he said.\par \par \uc2 Illegal immigration became a hot-button issue in Milford after several fatal car crashes involving illegal immigrants, including one in August 2011, when an allegedly drunken Ecuadoran immigrant struck and killed a 23-year-old motorcyclist. Nicolas Guaman was charged with vehicular homicide while under the influence and several other charges in the death of Matthew Denice.\par \par \uc2 The IMAGE program will be used to verify that town employees are eligible to work in the United States.\par \par \uc2 Milford Selectman Bill Buckley said the town of about 28,000 has long been a magnet for immigrants, in part because of a large supply of affordable rental housing. He said town officials hope the town's decision to join the IMAGE program will encourage businesses in town to do the same.\par \par \uc2 "What this does is say that employees hired by town hall, in the school system, the highway department, are subject to review by ICE. We get the verification in seconds, rather than days or months," Buckley said.\par \par \uc2 "We're looking to get private contractors and businesses to sign on to the program. The belief is that we can lead through example."\par \par \uc2 Foucart said that since ICE started the program in 2006, 163 businesses and nine municipalities around the country have signed agreements with ICE.\par \par \uc2 "Just as with a private employer, it's useful because it sends the right message in the community, that they (the town) are not going to be part of hiring illegally," Foucart said in an interview.\par \par \uc2 Eva Millona, executive director of the Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition, called the town's decision to join the IMAGE program a "pointless exercise" because it would check the status of town employees, and it's "very unlikely" \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  workers would seek employment with the town.\par \par \uc2 "Like many other enforcement programs, this is more about appearing tough rather than actually having an impact on our broken (immigration) system," she said.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120821e88l001si\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ATLANTA (AP) - Part of Alabama's immigration law that ordered public schools to check the citizenship status of new students was ruled unconstitutional Monday by a federal appeals court that also said police in that state and Georgia can demand papers from criminal suspects they have detained.\par \par \uc2 The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the Alabama schools provision wrongly singles out children who are in the country illegally. Alabama was the only state that passed such a requirement and the 11th Circuit previously had blocked that part of the law from being enforced.\par \par \uc2 Judges said fear of the law "significantly deters undocumented children from enrolling in and attending school ...."\par \par \uc2 Both private groups and the Obama administration filed lawsuits to block the law considered the toughest in the country.\par \par \uc2 The court, however, upheld parts of immigration laws in Alabama and Georgia allowing law enforcement to check documents for people they stop.\par \par \uc2 And the panel left in place an injunction that blocks a section of the Georgia law that allows for the prosecution of people who knowingly harbor or transport an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  during the commission of a crime.\par \par \uc2 In Alabama, the judges sided with opponents of the law on other key points, including challenges to sections that made it illegal to harbor illegal immigrants; made it a crime for illegal immigrants to seek work; and made it a state crime for people in the country illegally not to have registration documents.\par \par \uc2 The decisions follow a recent \uc2 U.S. Supreme Court\uc2  ruling upholding parts of a similar law in Arizona. The Atlanta-based court referenced that decision in its opinion to lift the injunction on the suspect verification section.\par \par \uc2 Georgia and Alabama are among several states that have enacted anti-illegal immigration laws in recent years. Proponents have argued they are necessary in part because of alleged federal inaction. Opponents have argued that many of the laws are punitive to immigrants and that policy must be steered by the federal government.\par \par \uc2 Omar Jadwat, an American Civil Liberties Union attorney involved in challenging similar laws in Alabama and Georgia, said the judges stuck down the schools provision "in pretty robust terms" and effectively opposed the sponsors' stated idea of forcing illegal immigrants to "self-deport" by making their lives too difficult.\par \par \uc2 "The original idea behind the law, that these provisions would all work together to allow the states to aggressively identify and prosecute undocumented residents, has been shot down," said Jadwat.\par \par \uc2 Alabama Republican Gov. \uc2 Robert Bentley\uc2  disagreed, saying the court upheld the "essence" of the law.\par \par \uc2 "The core of Alabama's immigration law remains that if you live or work in the state, you should do so legally," said Bentley, who signed the measure. "It is time now to move past court battles and focus on enforcement of Alabama's law."\par \par \uc2 School officials said many Hispanic parents quit sending their children to class immediately after Bentley signed the law, and some families left the state in fear. Local education systems have said many children returned to class, and some immigrant families moved back to Alabama after courts blocked many provisions in the law.\par \par \uc2 In a statement, Georgia Attorney General Sam Olens said he was generally pleased with the ruling for his state but disagreed with the court on the section dealing with transporting \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  that is still being blocked.\par \par \uc2 Jadwat said the organization will continue to challenge so-called "show-me-your-papers" provisions of the state immigration laws.\par \par \uc2 "The court today rejected many parts of Alabama and Georgia's anti-immigrant laws, including attempts to criminalize everyday interactions with undocumented immigrants and Alabama's callous attempt to deprive some children of their constitutional right to education," he said in a statement. "The court explicitly left the door open to further challenges against the `show me your papers' provision, which we will continue to fight."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writer Kate Brumback contributed to this report.

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc66}{\*\bkmkend toc66}\b \uc2 Appeals court: Georgia law enforcement may verify immigration status under 2011 law\b0\par\par\uc2 By BILL BARROW and KATE BRUMBACK   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 812 \uc2 words\par \uc2 20 August 2012\par 18:38\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2012.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ATLANTA (AP) - Law enforcement in Georgia, at least for now, may verify the immigration status of criminal suspects who fail to produce proper identification, a federal appeals court ruled Monday.\par \par \uc2 A three-judge panel of 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said that a lower court's hold blocking that section of the state's 2011 immigration law should be lifted. It was not immediately clear when that would happen.\par \par \uc2 The panel did leave in place a part of the injunction blocking the prosecution of people who knowingly harbor or transport an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  during the commission of a crime.\par \par \uc2 A lower court must still rule on both of those issues, which are part of a broader challenge to the law by activist groups and labor unions. Monday's decision dealt only with preliminary injunctions.\par \par \uc2 The decision follows a recent \uc2 U.S. Supreme Court\uc2  ruling upholding parts of a similar law in Arizona. The Atlanta-based court referenced that decision in its opinion to lift the injunction on the verification section, also known as section 8.\par \par \uc2 "In Arizona v. United States, the \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2  approved of a similar state provision, and in light of that holding we likewise conclude at this stage of litigation that Plaintiffs are not likely to succeed on the claim that section 8 is pre-empted by federal law," the panel wrote.\par \par \uc2 Georgia is one of several states besides Arizona that has enacted anti-illegal immigration laws in recent years. Proponents have argued they are necessary in part because of alleged federal inaction. Opponents have argued that many of the laws are punitive to immigrants and that immigration policy must be steered by the federal government.\par \par \uc2 The appeals court also ruled that part of Alabama's tough immigration law that ordered public schools to check the citizenship status of new students was ruled unconstitutional. It said police there also could continue to check papers for suspects they detain.\par \par \uc2 Circuit Judge Charles Wilson wrote in a 33-page decision that Georgia' section on checking immigration status "is less facially problematic than the provision" that the \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2  let stand in Arizona. That law requires authorities to investigate immigration status when a detainee cannot prove their legality. The Georgia law merely authorizes such action.\par \par \uc2 Wilson, however, also emphasized the \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2 's explanation that it was siding with Arizona before the law's actual implementation. "The Court left open the possibility that interpretation and application of Arizona's law could prove problematic in practice and refused to foreclose future challenges," Wilson wrote.\par \par \uc2 Basically, the court reasoned, future plaintiffs could raise constitutional issues if the law is enforced in a discriminatory way. Wilson noted that Georgia's law specifically bars racial profiling in its application.\par \par \uc2 Both sides claimed some victory in the divided ruling.\par \par \uc2 In a statement, Georgia Attorney General Sam Olens said he was generally pleased with the ruling but disagreed with the court on the section still being blocked.\par \par \uc2 "After over a year of litigation, only one of the 23 sections of (House Bill) 87 has been invalidated. We are currently reviewing the 11th Circuit's ruling to determine whether further appeal would be appropriate at this stage of the case," Olens said.\par \par \uc2 A spokesman for Gov. Nathan Deal also focused on the immediate result. "We knew Georgia was on solid footing" after the Arizona ruling, Brian Robinson said.\par \par \uc2 American Civil Liberties Union\uc2  lawyer Omar Jadwat said he was disappointed the court didn't keep the injunction for the verification section but was pleased with the court's decision to keep one part of the injunction.\par \par \uc2 "I think it's a strong sign that all the state harboring laws will go down," Jadwat said.\par \par \uc2 He also said the organization will continue to challenge so-called "show-me-your-papers" provisions of the state immigration laws.\par \par \uc2 "The court today rejected many parts of Alabama and Georgia's anti-immigrant laws, including attempts to criminalize everyday interactions with undocumented immigrants and Alabama's callous attempt to deprive some children of their constitutional right to education," he said in a statement. "The court explicitly left the door open to further challenges against the `show me your papers' provision, which we will continue to fight."\par \par \uc2 State Rep. Matt Ramsey, R-Peachtree City, sponsored the immigration bill. "Just as we were pleased when the \uc2 US Supreme Court\uc2  upheld one of the center pieces of the Arizona law ... we are pleased that the 11th Circuit has upheld a similar provision in our Georgia law," Ramsey said.\par \par \uc2 Sitting with Wilson on the case were Circuit Judge Beverly Martin and District Judge Richard Voorhees, a special appointee from federal trial court in North Carolina. Wilson and Martin are Democratic appointees. Voorhees is a Republican appointee.\par \par \uc2 5\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120820e88k002ec\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 BOSTON (AP) - Milford on Monday became the first town in New England to partner with federal immigration officials in a program aimed at preventing the hiring of illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Under the voluntary program known as IMAGE -- ICE Mutual Agreement between Government and Employers -- companies and municipalities are given education and training in proper hiring procedures, fraudulent document detection and the use of employment screening tools such as E-Verify. Certified employers also undergo an audit to ensure current employees are authorized to work in the United States.\par \par \uc2 Officials from Milford and \uc2 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2  signed the agreement Monday night at Milford's Board of Selectmen meeting.\par \par \uc2 "The newly formed partnership with ICE and the Town of Milford underscores this town's commitment to protecting the integrity of their workforce and to foster best hiring practices," Bruce Foucart, special agent in charge of ICE's Homeland Security Investigations in Boston, said in a press release.\par \par \uc2 "I am hopeful that other municipalities and companies will follow the actions that Milford has taken," he said.\par \par \uc2 Illegal immigration became a hot-button issue in Milford after several fatal car crashes involving illegal immigrants, including one in August 2011, when an allegedly drunken Ecuadoran immigrant struck and killed a 23-year-old motorcyclist. Nicolas Guaman was charged with vehicular homicide while under the influence and several other charges in the death of Matthew Denice.\par \par \uc2 The IMAGE program will be used to verify that town employees are eligible to work in the United States.\par \par \uc2 Milford Selectman Bill Buckley said the town of about 28,000 has long been a magnet for immigrants, in part because of a large supply of affordable rental housing. He said town officials hope the town's decision to join the IMAGE program will encourage businesses in town to do the same.\par \par \uc2 "What this does is say that employees hired by town hall, in the school system, the highway department, are subject to review by ICE. We get the verification in seconds, rather than days or months," Buckley said.\par \par \uc2 "We're looking to get private contractors and businesses to sign on to the program. The belief is that we can lead through example."\par \par \uc2 Foucart said that since ICE started the program in 2006, 163 businesses and nine municipalities around the country have signed agreements with ICE.\par \par \uc2 "Just as with a private employer, it's useful because it sends the right message in the community, that they (the town) are not going to be part of hiring illegally," Foucart said in an interview.\par \par \uc2 Eva Millona, executive director of the Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition, called the town's decision to join the IMAGE program a "pointless exercise" because it would check the status of town employees, and it's "very unlikely" \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  workers would seek employment with the town.\par \par \uc2 "Like many other enforcement programs, this is more about appearing tough rather than actually having an impact on our broken (immigration) system," she said.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120820e88k001ks\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WICHITA, Kan. (AP) - A Jamaican woman accused of entering into a "sham marriage" with a Kansas soldier faces a federal trial Tuesday during which jurors must decide whether she wed for love or for immigration purposes in a criminal prosecution.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors say Shannakay Hunter was an a \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who conspired with Joshua Priest, then a private in the \uc2 U.S. Army\uc2  stationed at Fort Riley, to enter into marriage so she could get a "green card" and regain her legal status, as well as receive military benefits such as health care for herself and her two children. Priest, 23, in turn received Army housing and subsistence benefits provided to married soldiers. The government contends their May 2010 marriage in Junction City was never consummated and the couple never lived together.\par \par \uc2 But the defense in its court filings has portrayed the 28-year-old Jamaican immigrant, who lives in Bronx, New York, as a hardworking mother who admittedly overstayed her visa but married for love -- and that her husband only made the allegations of fraud out of anger. The defense plans to call as a witness the victim advocate who took care of Hunter after an alleged domestic abuse incident in Junction City involving Priest.\par \par \uc2 Which portrayal of Hunter prevails -- fraud or loving wife -- will be determined during a three-day trial that begins Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Wichita. Hunter faces charges of conspiracy to commit marriage fraud, marriage fraud and making a false statement to the government. If convicted she faces up to five years in prison on each count, although she would likely get far less, if any, prison time under federal sentencing guidelines. But she would likely be deported.\par \par \uc2 "I am absolutely mystified by this prosecution," defense attorney Molly McMurray said in a phone interview. "You know, there are hordes of people coming into this country every day, and for some reason the government is picking on a woman who came here legally who has no criminal record. Now, she did overstay her visa, but she works and she takes care of her two children, who are United States citizens."\par \par \uc2 Assistant U.S. Attorney Brent Anderson, who is prosecuting the case, in an email said, "We disagree with the lawyer's statement but we cannot respond to it as to this specific case until after the case has been concluded."\par \par \uc2 Priest is expected to be the government's star witness. He pleaded guilty in July to conspiracy to commit marriage fraud and wire fraud in a deal with prosecutors for leniency in exchange for his testimony against his wife. He will be sentenced in October after admitting he got $26,000 in military benefits for married soldiers that he was not entitled to receive.\par \par \uc2 The marriage came to the government's attention in February 2011 when Hunter returned to Fort Riley from New York to make sure Priest would attend an upcoming immigration hearing in which her change of status was going to be heard. She told Priest's superiors that he failed to provide support to her since their marriage, as required by Army regulations, and that he needed to be ordered to attend her impending immigration hearing, given his "moral obligation" to do so, according to a court filing.\par \par \uc2 After his superiors confronted him, Priest told them the marriage was arranged so Hunter could get legal immigration status. His superiors ordered him to attend the immigration hearing but also reported the suspected marriage fraud to an \uc2 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2  fraud hotline and the Army's Central Investigations Divisions, court documents show.\par \par \uc2 Hunter's defense attorney acknowledged that while the couple has always lived apart, she would often come to visit her husband in Kansas.\par \par \uc2 "She is adamant -- and has been the entire time -- that she is innocent," McMurray said. "It is weighing heavily on her."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120820e88k001a3\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A woman accused of keeping an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  as a servant at her upstate New York mansion says the housekeeper has become a prosecution witness in an effort to get legal status to remain in the United States.\par \par \uc2 But prosecutors say the woman, who faces a federal felony, kept her emigre servant overworked, underpaid and essentially captive for several years.\par \par \uc2 Both sides agree the housekeeper, identified in court papers only as V.M., a middle-aged widow from India, worked for Annie George, her late husband and six children for five years. Immigration investigators removed her in May 2011 after her son in India called the National Human Trafficking Resources Center, which says it has identified hundreds of similar U.S. cases.\par \par \uc2 Bradley Miles, executive director of the nonprofit \uc2 Polaris Project\uc2 , which runs the 24-hour phone service, said the most frequently reported type of labor trafficking the organization hears about on the hotline are domestic servitude cases. Since 2008, it has received more than 2,500 calls directly from survivors of sex and labor trafficking, and about 60 or 70 daily looking for referrals, resources, training or "crisis calls," he said.\par \par \uc2 "I feel it's just the tip of the iceberg," Miles said. They try to determine if there are specific indicators of force, fraud or coercion and since 2008 have recorded 340 domestic servitude situations "with high indicators" that the cases constitute human trafficking. The callers are referred to a network of nonprofits and police across the country.\par \par \uc2 Miles said other highly publicized household forced labor cases over the past decade involved \u233\'00\'E9migr\u233\'00\'E9s from the Philippines, Indonesia and Egypt. His organization is guided by a federal definition of human trafficking from the 2000 federal law and looks for types of control that include violence, threats, isolation or holding debt over someone's head.\par \par \uc2 The 40-year-old George, who faces trial Aug. 27, is accused of harboring an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  for private financial gain, a crime punishable by up to 10 years in prison. U.S. District Judge Gary Sharpe dismissed the charge in July on a scheduling technicality but prosecutors got a new indictment days later. George has pleaded not guilty.\par \par \uc2 Her lawyer, Mark Sacco, had requested dismissal and said he hoped prosecutors had better things to do with their time. He also said the pay dispute, using corrected math, was about $40,000 and could easily be settled in civil court. Prosecutors said V.M. is due at least $240,000 in wages and $79,000 in overtime based on the minimum wage.\par \par \uc2 In a trial brief, Sacco said V.M. had legal papers and was working with a family in New Jersey in 2005. She left that job for a romantic relationship that ended, leaving her homeless. She was taken in by a church -- which she asked to help her find work -- claimed to be a legal U.S. visitor, and was hired by George's husband, Mathai Kolath George, in 2006 to work for his family as a live-in domestic servant for $1,000 a month. She filled out no paperwork and didn't change her visa status.\par \par \uc2 "She was provided room, board and a stipend which was forwarded to her children in her home country," Sacco wrote. "As an avenue to secure permanent legal status in the United States for both herself and her children, she has condemned my client."\par \par \uc2 Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard Belliss said V.M. is still in the United States and self-supporting at this point. She has temporary status in the country pending the outcome of the trial, he said. She also may testify at trial, along with the immigration investigators who removed her from George's home, after first being told she wasn't there.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors said V.M. was eventually pushed out a side door of the mansion without her bags, later got them and found her diary missing.\par \par \uc2 They said V.M. was paid about $26,000 for more than five years of cooking, cleaning and child care every day from 5:30 a.m. to almost midnight. She spoke little English, never saw a doctor or dentist, seldom left the house and was taken to an immigration lawyer once but got no documents.\par \par \uc2 She worked in the family's homes first in Catskill in the Hudson Valley, suburban Albany and then the more than 20,000-square-foot stone mansion called Llenroc, 15 miles northwest of Albany.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors could claim the mansion as the "vehicle ... used in the commission of the offense" if George is convicted.\par \par \uc2 Mathai George, a native of India who built a hotel and real estate development business in the U.S., was killed in 2009 along with his 11-year-old son and another man when their private plane crashed after takeoff.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Online: \uc2 Polaris Project\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.polarisproject.org/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.polarisproject.org/}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120818e88i001yn\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

Heineman says despite federal policy, Nebraska will deny licenses to illegal immigrants\b0\par\par\uc2 By GRANT SCHULTE   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 543 \uc2 words\par \uc2 17 August 2012\par 16:23\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2012.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) - Nebraska will continue to deny driver's licenses to young illegal immigrants who are now eligible for U.S. work permits under a new Obama administration policy, Gov. Dave Heineman said Friday.\par \par \uc2 The Republican governor said the state will not issue licenses, welfare benefits or any other public assistance to the immigrants unless otherwise required by Nebraska law.\par \par \uc2 "They shouldn't be here if they're not here legally," Heineman told reporters. "That's the whole problem, and I've talked to you guys about this many, many times. When you don't secure the border, have a speedier technological way to legal immigration, and you won't address the issue that we've got 15 million illegal immigrants in the country right now, we end up with these situations."\par \par \uc2 The federal policy that went into effect this week allows illegal immigrants to apply for a work permit and a temporary stay if they were brought to the country as children and have no criminal background.\par \par \uc2 Hundreds of thousands of them could benefit from the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which President Barack Obama announced in June. The program is beginning just months before what promises to be a tight contest for the White House in which the Hispanic vote may play an important role.\par \par \uc2 Arizona Gov. \uc2 Jan Brewer\uc2 , a Republican, ordered her state this week not to issue driver's licenses to those who apply for work papers under the new program. Other states, such as California, already issue driver's licenses to illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Immigration remains a volatile issue in Nebraska, and has led to fierce disagreements between Heineman and the Legislature.\par \par \uc2 In April, Heineman vetoed a proposal to extend prenatal care benefits to \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  women and accused lawmakers of placing an unfair tax burden on legal Nebraska residents. Lawmakers overrode the veto and forced the measure into law, with supporters arguing that the need to protect fetuses trumped the concerns about illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 Heineman acknowledged Friday that his announcement will not affect the prenatal care bill.\par \par \uc2 Groups that are helping young immigrants apply for the program say it encourages them to find jobs and contribute to Nebraska's economy.\par \par \uc2 "Without something like this, we're almost asking for a tremendous amount of anger, frustration, and what's that going to lead to?" said Max Graves, executive director of the Center for Legal Immigration Assistance in Lincoln. "I don't think that's good for the community. This encourages kids to stay in school. It encourages them to get a diploma. It encourages them to make the most of their skills and abilities, and to express those through work."\par \par \uc2 Graves said about 50 people have expressed interest in the program in the last few days. Banning the immigrants from getting a license could force them to drive without one, he said. And not being able to drive could complicate their efforts to find legitimate work.\par \par \uc2 "Nobody can get a driver's license without legal documentation," Graves said. "But these kids, if they're approved for this, are legally documented. They have legal authorization by the federal government."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120817e88h002ga\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

(AP) - The stepfather of a woman who spent 21 years in a coma after being beaten by her husband said he knows she would have died years earlier had it not been for the family's care of her at home.\par \par \uc2 Bernadette Jones, 51, of Niagara Falls, died Sunday of pneumonia at her family's home, The Buffalo News ( {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://bit.ly/RmLIYL"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://bit.ly/RmLIYL}}}\uc2 ) reported. As her stepfather, Robert Anderson Jr., and other relatives prepared for her funeral Friday, Anderson recalled how family and friends came together when the mother of three was released from the hospital eight months after the attack.\par \par \uc2 Jones could breathe on her own but needed a feeding tube. She never woke up, although family members said she would eventually open her left eye and move her arms as they cared for her, played music and read from the Bible. Early on, her three children would climb into bed with her and sleep.\par \par \uc2 "You have to do it willingly and 300 percent or don't do it," Anderson, 70, told The Buffalo News. "Through all the trials and tribulations we went through, we never once argued over Bernadette."\par \par \uc2 Her late mother, Marie Anderson, obtained round-the-clock medical care from the state's Crime Victims Board, which also gave money toward the construction of a room for Jones at the back of the family home.\par \par \uc2 "We know she would have expired a long time ago if she had not come home to live with us," said Robert Anderson, a City Council member. "We know she's gone home to God and to her mother and wow, that's a plus."\par \par \uc2 Jones was beaten by her husband, Patrick Guiteau, on April 14, 1991. Guiteau, 58, was convicted of first-degree assault and sentenced in November 1992 to 10 to 15 years in prison. State prison records show he was released to immigration officials in 2002. Jones' relatives said Guiteau was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  and was deported to Haiti.\par \par \uc2 Niagara County prosecutors did not immediately respond to messages Friday asking whether Guiteau might face further charges related to Jones' death.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Information from: The Buffalo News, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.buffalonews.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.buffalonews.com}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120817e88h002dh\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Tens of thousands of illegal immigrants would become eligible to receive government financial aid to attend college in New York under a bill that state Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver introduced Friday.\par \par \uc2 The powerful Democrat's bill follows the Obama administration "Dream Act" initiative this week. It defers deportation for young illegal immigrants and makes it easier for them to get better jobs and pay for college.\par \par \uc2 "My parents came here as immigrants and I was able to have opportunities precisely because this country welcomed my family and allowed us to work hard and succeed," Silver said Friday.\par \par \uc2 If it becomes law in New York, Silver's measure could influence the presidential debate. The state is home to more than 4 million legal immigrants and growing fast, and it has some of the nation's highest concentrations of public and private colleges. Because illegal immigrants are undocumented, it's hard to estimate their numbers.\par \par \uc2 New York's proposal comes two days after Arizona Gov. \uc2 Jan Brewer\uc2  issued an executive order denying driver's licenses and other public benefits to illegal immigrants who are authorized to work under the Obama program. She said those rights are reserved for legal residents.\par \par \uc2 Under the federal program, immigrants must prove they arrived in the United States before they turned 16, are under 31 years old and lived in the United States at least five years. They also must be in school or graduated or have served in the U.S. military, have no convictions and pose no threat to public safety.\par \par \uc2 "We don't have enough engineers and scientists in this country," Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, said in an interview. "If we have young immigrants, we need to give them the opportunity to a college education that will increase our pool and make New York state business better overall."\par \par \uc2 The Senate's Democratic minority has supported a New York "Dream Act," which they are trying to make a campaign issue for the fall elections to regain the majority from Republicans.\par \par \uc2 "We commend the speaker for this legislation," said Senate Democratic spokesman Mike Murphy. "This is something that we are extremely supportive of and I think it goes perfectly with our Dream Act legislation that we pushed this year, but was unfortunately blocked by the Senate Republicans."\par \par \uc2 There was no immediate comment from the Senate's Republican majority nor from Democratic Gov. \uc2 Andrew Cuomo\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Under New York law, \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students already pay the lower public college tuition for state residents, rather than the higher rate for those coming from outside New York.\par \par \uc2 The bill would provide access to the Tuition Assistance Program that provides grants to hundreds of thousands of students each year in public and private colleges, according to the bill co-sponsored by Assembly Higher Education Committee Chairwoman Deborah Glick of Manhattan and Assemblyman Francisco Moya of Queens.\par \par \uc2 While the bill would make TAP available for illegal immigrants, TAP was discontinued for graduate students who are legal residents beginning in the 2010-11 state budget as part of spending cuts in a fiscal crisis in a policy that continues today. TAP provides varying grants up to full tuition based on financial need to more than 309,000 students. In the current budget, TAP was increased by $21 million to a total of $930 million.\par \par \uc2 Illegal immigrants would also be eligible for other grants and low-interest loans based on financial need.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 MIAMI (AP) - Araceli Cortes had made up her mind: After being brought to the U.S. as a child, graduating from high school and attending some college in California, she was going to return to Mexico to pursue her dream of becoming a doctor.\par \par \uc2 She quit her job, bought an airline ticket and reserved a seat to take a medical school entrance exam.\par \par \uc2 Then, a week before her departure, President Barack Obama announced that young illegal immigrants like Cortes would be given the chance to remain in the United States and obtain a work visa. Cortes canceled her ticket and decided to stay.\par \par \uc2 This week, she and thousands of other immigrants began the application process. But she and many other student immigrants could face some tough obstacles.\par \par \uc2 "It's not giving me much," Cortes, 20, said. "It's just a two-year permit."\par \par \uc2 Obama was clear in announcing the order: This was not a path to citizenship, but rather an opportunity to avoid deportation and work.\par \par \uc2 For the students who are illegal immigrants and have graduated from college, the new policy means they will have the opportunity to work in their field of study, something they could only do as independent contractors or unpaid interns before.\par \par \uc2 For younger immigrants like Cortes -- as many as 65,000 of whom are estimated to graduate from high school each year -- some barriers to earning a college degree will be removed. The main hurdle, however, will remain cost. Federal loans and grants, the largest source of aid for college students, require students to have a green card or U.S. citizenship.\par \par \uc2 "There's still going to be a challenge for these students to pursue higher education," said Deborah Santiago, co-founder and vice president for policy and research of Excelencia in Education. "I don't think the numbers are going to be high."\par \par \uc2 Children who are illegal immigrants have been guaranteed the right to a K-12 education since the 1982 Plyler v. Doe Supreme Court decision.\par \par \uc2 A growing number of those students are now entering adolescence and early adulthood. They speak English, are part of after-school clubs and sports, and have the same aspirations to attend college as their peers. Yet around the age of 16, they stop having the same opportunities. When most teens get a driver's license, a first job and start thinking about college, \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students start to become aware of their status.\par \par \uc2 "They stay stuck while their friends are moving forward," said Roberto Gonzales, a sociologist at the University of Chicago. "And that has tremendous implications on their own ability to achieve any upward mobility, on issues of self-esteem and on emotional and mental well-being."\par \par \uc2 The Plyler v. Doe ruling did not address higher education. Rather, individual states and colleges have set their own policies on whether to allow illegal immigrants to attend.\par \par \uc2 Among illegal immigrants who are high school graduates between the ages of 18 to 24, 49 percent are in or have attended some college, compared with 76 percent of legal immigrants and 71 percent of U.S.-born residents, according to a Pew Hispanic Center study of 2008 census data.\par \par \uc2 Jane Slater, who teaches English as a second language at a high school in Redwood City, Calif., said fewer than half of the students who are illegal immigrants at her school go to college.\par \par \uc2 "There's that sort of hopeless feeling of `Why go?'" she said.\par \par \uc2 The price of tuition and fees increased 439 percent between 1982 and 2007, while the median family income rose 147 percent, according to the National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education. Parent and student loans, grants and scholarships help the average student pay about 55 percent of the cost, according to a report by Sallie Mae, the largest private lender to students.\par \par \uc2 Students with no legal status in the U.S. have access to just a slice of those resources. Selected private scholarships are often very competitive because of the limited number available. In a few states, they also qualify for state aid. But in most, they end up having to pay significantly higher tuition. Only 12 states allow illegal immigrants to pay in-state rates.\par \par \uc2 The majority of those who do enroll attend community colleges but often can afford only one or two classes a semester, or may have to take breaks in order to work full time. That means it takes significantly longer for them to graduate.\par \par \uc2 Katharine Gin, co-founder and executive director for the Education for Fair Consideration, is optimistic more scholarships from corporations and other funders will become available.\par \par \uc2 "They were moved by their stories. They felt like they deserved things but said, `How can I justify putting money to these students when they cannot work in the end?'" Gin said. "I think that will change."\par \par \uc2 Cortes took AP classes in high school and was accepted to every University of California school she applied to. And while California is one of the states that allow illegal immigrants to pay in-state tuition, she said it was still too expensive. A private school offered her a $14,000 scholarship, but that would have covered only half the annual costs.\par \par \uc2 She decided to go to community college instead and found a full-time job as a cashier at a car wash to help pay. Like at many community colleges, the classes she needs to enroll in to study medicine -- biology, chemistry -- fill up quickly and to get in, she needs a higher credit standing. That means taking classes in other subjects, essentially paying for courses that will have little to do with her medical degree.\par \par \uc2 Frustrated, she started looking for other options. Her father, who lives in Mexico, helped her fill out the paperwork to apply for a medical school there, but because she canceled her plane ticket, she lost her seat for the exam and won't be able to take it again.\par \par \uc2 Cortes has read through dozens of news articles online and recorded Obama's speech on the White House lawn, watching it repeatedly and trying to figure out what to do.\par \par \uc2 "He was very specific in saying, Don't think the wrong way about this," she said. "This is nothing for residency or citizenship."\par \par \uc2 Cortes went to the Mexican Consulate, which put her in touch with an organization, Dream in Mexico, that helps students find educational opportunities in Mexico. She applied to El Tecnologico de Monterrey and is waiting for a reply.\par \par \uc2 If she gets accepted and is given a scholarship to cover her fees, she's leaning toward going, even though she applied to stay in this country.\par \par \uc2 Cortes figures she'll save time, money and could still end up practicing medicine one day in the United States.\par \par \uc2 "As much as I want to stay here and be with my family, I have to think of the future," she said. "I have to think what's best for me."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Follow Christine Armario on Twitter at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.twitter.com/cearmario"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.twitter.com/cearmario}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120817e88h001jo\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.  \par \par \uc2 SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) - Nathaly Uribe has all the papers she needs to get a work permit -- something the 17-year-old daughter of a construction worker only dreamed of growing up as an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  in the United States.\par \par \uc2 The high school senior said she hopes a federal program beginning Wednesday that defers deportation for illegal immigrants will make it easier to get a decent job and help pay for college.\par \par \uc2 "This is my country. It's where my roots are," said Uribe, who moved from Chile when she was a toddler and lives in Glen Burnie, Md. "It feels great to know that the country that I call home is finally accepting me."\par \par \uc2 Thousands of young illegal immigrants lined up Wednesday hoping for the right to work legally in America without being deported. The Obama administration's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals could expand the rights of more than 1 million young illegal immigrants by giving them work permits, though they would not obtain legal residency here or a path to citizenship.\par \par \uc2 At least 13,000 people stood in line in Chicago, clutching reams of paperwork, for a workshop led by immigrant rights advocates at the city's Navy Pier. Hundreds of potential applicants waited outside nonprofit offices in Los Angeles for help filing paperwork to open the door to the staples of success in America -- a work permit, and then later a Social Security number and driver's license.\par \par \uc2 "It's something I have been waiting for since I was two years old," said Bupendra Ram, a 25-year-old communications graduate student in Fullerton, Calif., who still needs supporting documents from his Fiji Islands home before he can apply. "This offers us an opportunity to fulfill the dreams I've had since I was a child."\par \par \uc2 Less than three months before an expected tight presidential election, the new immigration program is mired in controversy. Republican critics accuse President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  of drafting the plan to boost his political standing with Latinos ahead of November's vote and say the program favors illegal immigrants over unemployed American citizens during dismal economic times.\par \par \uc2 In Arizona, which passed one of the nation's toughest anti-immigration laws, Gov. \uc2 Jan Brewer\uc2  signed an executive order Wednesday directing state agencies to deny driver's licenses and other public benefits to illegal immigrants who obtain work authorizations under the program. Brewer said the federal program doesn't give immigrants legal status and she's following the intent of the current state law denying public benefits to them.\par \par \uc2 To be eligible for the federal program, immigrants must prove they arrived in the United States before they turned 16, are 30 or younger, have been living in the country at least five years and are in school or graduated or served in the military. They cannot have been convicted of certain crimes or otherwise pose a safety threat.\par \par \uc2 Initial concerns that federal authorities might take a tough approach on applications or that a Republican presidential victory could unravel applicants' gains have largely been pushed aside by massive interest from thousands of young people eager to work.\par \par \uc2 In Los Angeles, one immigrant rights' group started hosting hourly information sessions over the last month to keep up with the frenzy. The \uc2 Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights\uc2  of Los Angeles has handed out 12,000 information packets about the program and is encouraging all eligible immigrants to apply as long as they have stayed out of legal trouble, said \uc2 Angelica Salas\uc2 , the organization's director.\par \par \uc2 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney does not support so-called Dream Act legislation for illegal immigrants who attend college -- a key group that Obama aims to reach with this program. The former Massachusetts governor has also criticized the deferred action program but has not said it he would reverse it, pledging instead an unspecified "civil but resolute" long-term fix to illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 So far, the measure has won favor for Obama along Latinos -- many who view immigration as a litmus test when choosing a political candidate, said Manuel Pastor, director of the University of Southern California's Center for the Study of Immigrant Integration.\par \par \uc2 "What this has done is to signal that the president, who was unable to get comprehensive immigration reform, does at least care about the situation of these immigrants," Pastor said. "This is something that has been overwhelmingly popular in the immigrant population and in the Latino population in general."\par \par \uc2 Some Republican lawmakers have accused Obama of sidestepping Congress and creating a backdoor amnesty program.\par \par \uc2 "It's a betrayal of American young people," said Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, a California Republican. "We're supposed to be representing the interests of the American people -- not people who come here illegally from other countries."\par \par \uc2 In an internal document outlining the program's implementation, Department of Homeland Security officials estimated more than 1 million people would apply in the first year and about 890,000 would be eligible.\par \par \uc2 On Wednesday, immigrants lined up for help filing applications at workshops around the country. Others sought identity documents from consulates to be able to apply.\par \par \uc2 Jaqueline Cinto said she's still working on gathering the documents she needs, knowing it's her only shot at putting her master's degree in education to good use. But she's nervous that filing the papers might put her relatives at risk for deportation -- even though Homeland Security officials have said they will generally not use applicants' information to track down other family.\par \par \uc2 "I am even more afraid that I might be denied," said Cinto, 26, who came to New York more than a decade ago from Mexico.\par \par \uc2 In central California, one group has been warning farmworkers and their children not to sign up for the program at all.\par \par \uc2 "Immigration agents could haul them off that same day," said \uc2 Manuel Cunha\uc2 , president of the Nisei Farmers League. "Even if they don't, if this policy is disbanded, now ICE has the addresses of all the families. Why would you want to squeal on your parents?"\par \par \uc2 The documents to prove identity could include passports, birth certificates, school transcripts, medical, financial and military records. Multiple sworn affidavits, signed under penalty of perjury, can also be used, Homeland Security officials said. Anyone found to have committed fraud will be referred to federal immigration agents, the department said.\par \par \uc2 Laura Lichter, a Denver attorney who heads the \uc2 American Immigration Lawyers Association\uc2 , said everyone takes a risk by applying.\par \par \uc2 "I would say that people are between a rock and a hard place. In most cases, people can take (the government) at their word that their intent is to administer this policy in a fair and appropriate manner but there are going to be people that are going to find themselves having problems," she said\par \par \uc2 A decision on each application could take several months, and immigrants have been warned not to leave the country while their application is pending. If they are allowed to stay in the United States and want to travel internationally, they will need to apply for permission to come back into the country, a request that would cost another $360.\par \par \uc2 The lines on Wednesday grew throughout the day; the crowd in Chicago was so large that workshop organizers told them to come back another day.\par \par \uc2 "Navy Pier is today's Ellis Island, and while they saw New York City, today they see Chicago," said Illinois congressman Luis Gutierrez. "But the most important thing is they see America."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Contributing to this report were Andres Gonzalez and Alicia A. Caldwell in Washington, Elliot Spagat in San Diego, Gosia Wozniacka in Fresno, Calif., Sitthixay Ditthavong and Sophia Tareen in Chicago and Paul Davenport in Phoenix.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120816e88g0006c\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.  \par \par \uc2 SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) - Nathaly Uribe has all the papers she needs to get a work permit -- something the 17-year-old daughter of a construction worker only dreamed of growing up as an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  in the United States.\par \par \uc2 The high school senior said she hopes a federal program beginning Wednesday and defers deportation for illegal immigrants will make it easier to get a decent job and help pay for college.\par \par \uc2 "This is my country. It's where my roots are," said Uribe, who moved from Chile when she was a toddler and lives in Glen Burnie, Md. "It feels great to know that the country that I call home is finally accepting me."\par \par \uc2 Thousands of young illegal immigrants lined up Wednesday hoping for the right to work legally in America without being deported. The Obama administration's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals could expand the rights of more than 1 million young illegal immigrants by giving them work permits, though they would not obtain legal residency here or a path to citizenship.\par \par \uc2 At least 13,000 people stood in line in Chicago, clutching reams of paperwork, for a workshop led by immigrant rights advocates at the city's Navy Pier. Hundreds of potential applicants waited outside nonprofit offices in Los Angeles for help filing paperwork to open the door to the staples of success in America -- a work permit, and then later a Social Security number and driver's license.\par \par \uc2 "It's something I have been waiting for since I was two years old," said Bupendra Ram, a 25-year-old communications graduate student in Fullerton, Calif., who still needs supporting documents from his Fiji Islands home before he can apply. "This offers us an opportunity to fulfill the dreams I've had since I was a child."\par \par \uc2 Less than three months before an expected tight presidential election, the new immigration program is mired in controversy. Republican critics accuse President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  of drafting the plan to boost his political standing with Latinos ahead of November's vote and say the program favors illegal immigrants over unemployed American citizens during dismal economic times.\par \par \uc2 In Arizona, which passed one of the nation's toughest anti-immigration laws, Gov \uc2 Jan Brewer\uc2  signed an executive order Wednesday directing state agencies to deny driver's licenses and other public benefits to illegal immigrants who obtain work authorizations under the program. Brewer said she's following the intent of the current state law denying public benefits to illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 To be eligible for the federal program, immigrants must prove they arrived in the United States before they turned 16, are 30 or younger, have been living in the country at least five years and are in school or graduated or served in the military. They cannot have been convicted of certain crimes or otherwise pose a safety threat.\par \par \uc2 Initial concerns that federal authorities might take a tough approach on applications or that a Republican presidential victory could unravel applicants' gains have largely been pushed aside by massive interest from thousands of young people eager to work.\par \par \uc2 In Los Angeles, one immigrant rights' group started hosting hourly information sessions over the last month to keep up with the frenzy. The \uc2 Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights\uc2  of Los Angeles has handed out 12,000 information packets about the program and is encouraging all eligible immigrants to apply as long as they have stayed out of legal trouble, said \uc2 Angelica Salas\uc2 , the organization's director.\par \par \uc2 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney does not support so-called Dream Act legislation for illegal immigrants who attend college -- a key group that Obama aims to reach with this program. The former Massachusetts governor has also criticized the deferred action program but has not said it he would reverse it, pledging instead an unspecified "civil but resolute" long-term fix to illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 So far, the measure has won favor for Obama along Latinos -- many who view immigration as a litmus test when choosing a political candidate, said Manuel Pastor, director of the University of Southern California's Center for the Study of Immigrant Integration.\par \par \uc2 "What this has done is to signal that the president, who was unable to get comprehensive immigration reform, does at least care about the situation of these immigrants," Pastor said. "This is something that has been overwhelmingly popular in the immigrant population and in the Latino population in general."\par \par \uc2 Some Republican lawmakers have accused Obama of sidestepping Congress and creating a backdoor amnesty program.\par \par \uc2 "It's a betrayal of American young people," said Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, a California Republican. "We're supposed to be representing the interests of the American people -- not people who come here illegally from other countries."\par \par \uc2 In an internal document outlining the program's implementation, Department of Homeland Security officials estimated more than 1 million people would apply in the first year and about 890,000 would be eligible.\par \par \uc2 On Wednesday, immigrants lined up for help filing applications at workshops around the country. Others sought identity documents from consulates to be able to apply.\par \par \uc2 Jaqueline Cinto said she's still working on gathering the documents she needs, knowing it's her only shot at putting her master's degree in education to good use. But she's nervous that filing the papers might put her relatives at risk for deportation -- even though Homeland Security officials have said they will generally not use applicants' information to track down other family.\par \par \uc2 "I am even more afraid that I might be denied," said Cinto, 26, who came to New York more than a decade ago from Mexico.\par \par \uc2 In central California, one group has been warning farmworkers and their children not to sign up for the program at all.\par \par \uc2 "Immigration agents could haul them off that same day," said \uc2 Manuel Cunha\uc2 , president of the Nisei Farmers League. "Even if they don't, if this policy is disbanded, now ICE has the addresses of all the families. Why would you want to squeal on your parents?"\par \par \uc2 The documents to prove identity could include passports, birth certificates, school transcripts, medical, financial and military records. Multiple sworn affidavits, signed under penalty of perjury, can also be used, Homeland Security officials said. Anyone found to have committed fraud will be referred to federal immigration agents, the department said.\par \par \uc2 Laura Lichter, a Denver attorney who heads the \uc2 American Immigration Lawyers Association\uc2 , said everyone takes a risk by applying.\par \par \uc2 "I would say that people are between a rock and a hard place. In most cases, people can take (the government) at their word that their intent is to administer this policy in a fair and appropriate manner but there are going to be people that are going to find themselves having problems," she said\par \par \uc2 A decision on each application could take several months, and immigrants have been warned not to leave the country while their application is pending. If they are allowed to stay in the United States and want to travel internationally, they will need to apply for permission to come back into the country, a request that would cost another $360.\par \par \uc2 The lines on Wednesday grew throughout the day; the crowd in Chicago was so large that workshop organizers told them to come back another day.\par \par \uc2 "Navy Pier is today's Ellis Island, and while they saw New York City, today they see Chicago," said Illinois congressman Luis Gutierrez. "But the most important thing is they see America."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Contributing to this report were Andres Gonzalez and Alicia A. Caldwell in Washington, Elliot Spagat in San Diego, Gosia Wozniacka in Fresno, Calif., Sitthixay Ditthavong and Sophia Tareen in Chicago and Paul Davenport in Phoenix.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120815e88f0009o\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

(AP) -- Mitt Romney is portraying the outwardly calm President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  as a man seething with animosity and power lust as the Republicans seek to undermine one of the Democrat's greatest campaign strengths -- his personal likability. The president's re-election effort, Romney said Wednesday, "is all about division and attack and hatred." Obama, Romney added later while campaigning in Charlotte, is an angry man who "will do or say anything to get elected."\par \par \uc2 Thousands line up for right to work legally in US\par \par \uc2 SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- Nathaly Uribe has all the papers she needs to get a work permit -- something the 17-year-old daughter of a construction worker only dreamed of growing up as an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  in the United States. The high school senior said she hopes a federal program beginning Wednesday and defers deportation for illegal immigrants will make it easier to get a decent job and help pay for college.\par \par \uc2 AP PHOTOS: Young immigrants seek the right to work\par \par \uc2 Wednesday brought the first chance for young illegal immigrants to prove they have earned the right to live legally in America. The Obama administration's so-called "DREAM Act" program could give hundreds of thousands of immigrants work permits instead of deportation notices.\par \par \uc2 APNewsBreak: General investigated over spending\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) -- A four-star Army general who was the first head of the new U.S. Africa Command is under investigation and facing possible demotion for allegedly spending hundreds of thousands of dollars improperly on lavish travel, hotels and other items, The Associated Press has learned. Gen. William "Kip" Ward has been under investigation for about 17 months, and Defense Secretary \uc2 Leon Panetta\uc2  is expected to make a final decision on the matter before the end of the month, according to several defense officials.\par \par \uc2 Syrian warplanes bomb rebel-held town, 20 killed\par \par \uc2 AZAZ, Syria (AP) -- Syrian fighter jets screamed through the sky Wednesday over this rebel-held town, dropping bombs that leveled the better part of a poor neighborhood and wounded scores of people, many of them women and children buried under piles of rubble. Activists said more than 20 people were killed. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said 23 people died in the double airstrike and more than 200 were wounded. Mohammed Nour, a local activist reached by phone, put the death toll at 25. Neither figure could be independently confirmed.\par \par \uc2 Sept. 11 memorial defends display of steel cross\par \par \uc2 NEW YORK (AP) -- A judge should toss out a lawsuit by a national atheists group seeking to stop the display of a cross-shaped steel beam found among the wreckage of the World Trade Center, lawyers for the operators of the Sept. 11 memorial at ground zero say. The lawyers said in papers filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan on Monday that the 17-foot-tall beam will be displayed as a historical object because it tells part of the story of the rescue and recovery effort after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, which destroyed the twin towers and killed thousands of people.\par \par \uc2 Official: Suspect criticized group before shooting\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) -- A man suspected of shooting and wounding a security guard at the headquarters of a Christian lobbying group on Wednesday made a negative reference about the organization's work before opening fire, a law enforcement official said. Police said the man entered the front lobby of the \uc2 Family Research Council\uc2  in Washington around 10:45 a.m. Wednesday, began arguing with a security guard and then shot him in the arm. The gunman was subdued by the guard and others and taken into custody but had not been charged as of Wednesday evening.\par \par \uc2 Chris Brown\uc2 , Drake sued over NYC nightclub brawl\par \par \uc2 NEW YORK (AP) -- \uc2 Chris Brown\uc2  and Drake were sued Wednesday over a bottle-throwing nightclub brawl involving their entourages, as a company with ties to the club sought to hold the music stars responsible for the melee. Representatives for the R&B singer and the rapper didn't immediately answer inquiries for comment about the $16 million lawsuit, which faulted the artists for -- at a minimum -- doing nothing to stop June 14 melee and said it sullied the chic Manhattan nightspot's name.\par \par \uc2 Giants' Cabrera suspended for positive drug test\par \par \uc2 SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Melky Cabrera was suspended 50 games Wednesday following a positive test for testosterone, putting an abrupt end to what had been an MVP-caliber regular season and throwing the San Francisco Giants' playoff hopes into doubt. Cabrera leads the National League with 159 hits, and is second in batting average behind Pittsburgh's Andrew McCutchen. Cabrera's penalty was the first for a high-profile player since last year's NL MVP, Ryan Braun, had his suspension overturned by an arbitrator last winter.\par \par \uc2 Hernandez tosses perfect game in Seattle's 1-0 win\par \par \uc2 SEATTLE (AP) -- King Felix now has a crowning achievement. \uc2 Felix Hernandez\uc2  pitched the Seattle Mariners' first perfect game and the 23rd in baseball history, overpowering the Tampa Bay Rays in a brilliant 1-0 victory Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120815e88f0001u\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

(AP) - An American-born high school student was wrongfully denied state tuition assistance based on the fact her mother is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , a New Jersey appeals court ruled Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 The appellate division of New Jersey Superior Court determined that residency requirements pertained only to the student, finding that the applicant, identified by her initials A.Z., was a U.S. citizen who had spent most of her life in New Jersey.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 American Civil Liberties Union\uc2  and a Rutgers University legal clinic, which filed the appeal on A.Z.'s behalf, said the ruling could affect hundreds, and potentially thousands of American-born New Jersey high school students who were wrongfully denied tuition aid based on their parents' immigration status.\par \par \uc2 "A hardworking U.S.-born citizen at the top of her class should be the future of the American dream, not have her dreams stunted by discrimination," said Alexander Shalom, policy counsel for the ACLU's New Jersey chapter.\par \par \uc2 As a high school senior, A.Z. applied for a tuition aid grant from the state's Higher Education Student Assistance Authority. Her state aid application was rejected with the explanation that "her parents are not legal New Jersey residents."\par \par \uc2 The three-judge panel Wednesday determined the authority was wrong in its argument that the student lived with her mother, and by extension, could not be considered legally "domiciled" in New Jersey, because her mother, as an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , was not.\par \par \uc2 A message left for authority officials for comment was not immediately returned.\par \par \uc2 The appeals court took issue with the agency's definition of "domiciled" and voided a 2005 regulation it argued was beyond the agency's authority: a rule that had said a dependent student's legal residence was automatically determined to be that of his or her parents.\par \par \uc2 The ACLU declined to provide A.Z.'s full name, hometown or her mother's nationality, saying it wished to protect the family's identity. Shalom said he wasn't sure how the ruling would affect A.Z., saying she had taken a full-time job and enrolled in community college since filing the appeal because, without tuition assistance, she was unable to afford one of the four-year colleges where she was accepted.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Follow Samantha Henry at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.twitter.com/SamanthaHenry"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.twitter.com/SamanthaHenry}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120808e888001vl\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

Bar: Nothing disqualifies \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  but board still wants Supreme Court opinion\b0\par\par\uc2 By BILL KACZOR  \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 448 \uc2 words\par \uc2 7 August 2012\par 19:11\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2012.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.  \par \par \uc2 TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) - An \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  born in Mexico appears to qualify for a law license, though the Florida Board of Bar Examiners says it still wants an advisory opinion from the state Supreme Court before making a final decision.\par \par \uc2 The board initially denied Jose Godinez-Samperio's admission to the bar but asked the justices to decide whether being an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  disqualifies applicants. The new findings submitted to the Supreme Court on Monday are the result of a request by Godinez-Samperio to consider new information related to his character and fitness before the Supreme Court makes its decision.\par \par \uc2 Former Florida State University President Talbot "Sandy" D'Alemberte, now teaching law at the school, is representing his former student.\par \par \uc2 "I hope the bar examiners would just go ahead and approve his admission to the bar and just be done," D'Alemberte said Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 D'Alemberte, also a former American Bar Association president, said the board's findings that Godinez-Samperio had no moral character or fitness issues that would prevent his admission was more good news that could help the state Supreme Court rule in his favor. He said the justices could dismiss the board's request for an opinion.\par \par \uc2 President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  announced in June that his administration will let illegal immigrants remain in the United States if they are no older than 30, arrived as children, have no criminal history and graduated from high school or served in the military.\par \par \uc2 D'Alemberte filed a motion with the justices last month arguing that makes Godinez-Samperio eligible for legal immigration status and work authorization.\par \par \uc2 "No grounds remain for denying or further delaying his admission to the Florida Bar," D'Alemberte wrote.\par \par \uc2 The board also acknowledged, in a separate filing, that the Obama administration's new policy is relevant to Godinez-Samperio's case, but contended D'Alemberte violated a court rule by including argument in his motion for an order directing the board to conclude its investigation. The board says that request now is moot because of the new findings it has filed.\par \par \uc2 Godinez-Samperio's parents brought him to the United States from Mexico on a visitor's visa when he was 9. They overstayed their visas and never returned to Mexico. He grew up in rural Hillsborough County where his father, a veterinarian in Mexico, milked cows on a dairy farm, and his mother, a dentist, worked at a factory that made sliding glass doors.\par \par \uc2 Godinez-Samperio, 25, graduated from New College, earned a law degree from Florida State and passed the bar exam.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120807e887002d8\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc88}{\*\bkmkend toc88}\b \uc2 AP: Holding immigrants a boon to private prisons, which have spent $45M on lobbying, campaigns\b0\par\par\uc2 By LAURA WIDES-MUNOZ and GARANCE BURKE \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 2,249 \uc2 words\par \uc2 2 August 2012\par 18:09\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2012.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 MIAMI (AP) - Locking up illegal immigrants has grown profoundly lucrative for the private prisons industry, a reliable pot of revenue that helped keep some of the biggest companies in business.\par \par \uc2 And while nearly half of the 400,000 immigrants held annually are housed in private facilities, the federal government -- which spends $2 billion a year on keeping those people in custody -- says it isn't necessarily cheaper to outsource the work, a central argument used for privatization in the first place.\par \par \uc2 The Associated Press, seeking to tally the scope of the private facilities, add up their cost and the amounts the companies spend on lobbying and campaign donations, reviewed more than 10 years' worth of federal and state records. It found a complex, mutually beneficial and evidently legal relationship between those who make corrections and immigration policy and a few prison companies. Some of those companies were struggling to survive before toughened immigrant detention laws took effect.\par \par \uc2 A decade ago, just 10 percent of the beds in the nation's civil detention system were in private facilities with little federal oversight. Now, about half the beds are part of a sprawling, private system, largely controlled by just three companies: \uc2 Corrections Corporation of America\uc2 , \uc2 The GEO Group\uc2 , and \uc2 Management and Training Corp\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 And the growth is far from over, despite the sheer drop in illegal immigration in recent years.\par \par \uc2 CCA\uc2  was on the verge of bankruptcy in 2000 due to lawsuits, management problems and dwindling contracts. Last year, the company reaped $162 million in net income. Federal contracts made up 43 percent of its total revenues, in part thanks to rising immigrant detention.\par \par \uc2 GEO, which cites the immigration agency as its largest client, saw its net income jump from $16.9 million to $78.6 million since 2000.\par \par \uc2 At the same time, the three businesses have spent at least $45 million combined on campaign donations and lobbyists at the state and federal level in the last decade, the AP found.\par \par \uc2 This seismic shift toward a privatized system happened quietly. While Congress' unsuccessful efforts to overhaul immigration laws drew headlines and sparked massive demonstrations, lawmakers' negotiations to boost detention dollars received far less attention.\par \par \uc2 CCA\uc2  and GEO, who manage most private detention centers, insist they aren't trying to influence immigration policy to make more money, and their lobbying and campaign donations have been legal.\par \par \uc2 "As a matter of long-standing corporate policy, \uc2 CCA\uc2  does not lobby on issues that would determine the basis for an individual's detention or incarceration," CCA spokesman \uc2 Steve Owen\uc2  said in an email to the AP. The company has a website dedicated to debunking such allegations.\par \par \uc2 GEO, which was part of \uc2 The Wackenhut Corp\uc2 . security firm until 2003, and Management and Training declined repeated interview requests.\par \par \uc2 Advocates for immigrants are skeptical the lobbying is not meant to influence policy.\par \par \uc2 "That's a lot of money to listen quietly," said Peter Cervantes-Gautschi, who has helped lead a campaign to encourage large banks and mutual funds to divest from the prison companies.\par \par \uc2 The detention centers are located in cities and remote areas alike, from a Denver suburb to an industrial area flanking Newark's airport, often in low-slung buildings surrounded by chain-link fences and razor wire. U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agents detain men, women and children suspected of violating civil immigration laws at these facilities. Most of those held at the 250 sites nationwide are illegal immigrants awaiting deportation, but some green card holders, asylum seekers and others are also there.\par \par \uc2 The total average nightly cost to taxpayers to detain an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , including health care and guards' salaries, is about $166, ICE confirmed only after the AP calculated that figure and presented it to the agency.\par \par \uc2 That's up from $80 in 2004. ICE said the $80 didn't include all of the same costs but declined to provide details.\par \par \uc2 Pedro Guzman is among those who have passed through the private detention centers. He was brought to the U.S. by his Guatemalan mother at age 8. He was working and living here legally under temporary protected status but was detained after missing an appearance for an asylum application. Officials ordered him deported.\par \par \uc2 Although he was married to a U.S. citizen, ICE considered him a flight risk and locked him up in 2009: first at a private detention facility run by \uc2 CCA\uc2  in Gainesville, Ga., and eventually at \uc2 CCA\uc2 's Stewart Detention Center, south of Atlanta. Guzman spent 19 months in Stewart until he was finally granted legal permanent residency.\par \par \uc2 "It's a millionaire's business, and they are living off profits from each one of the people who go through there every single night," said Guzman, now a cable installer in Durham, N.C. "It's our money that we earn as taxpayers every day that goes to finance this."\par \par \uc2 The federal government stepped up detentions of illegal immigrants in the 1990s, as the number of people crossing the border soared. In 1996, Congress passed a law requiring many more illegal immigrants be locked up. But it wasn't until 2005 -- as the corrections companies' lobbying efforts reached their zenith -- that ICE got a major boost. Between 2005 and 2007, the agency's budget jumped from $3.5 billion to $4.7 billion, adding more than $5 million for custody operations.\par \par \uc2 Dora Schriro, who in 2009 reviewed the nation's detention system at the request of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, said nearly every aspect had been outsourced.\par \par \uc2 "ICE was always relying on others for responsibilities that are fundamentally those of the government," said Schriro, now the New York City Correction Commissioner. "If you don't have the competency to know what is a fair price to ask and negotiate the most favorable rates for the best service, then the likelihood that you are going to overspend is greater."\par \par \uc2 Private companies argue they can save Americans money by running the centers more cheaply.\par \par \uc2 Pablo Paez\uc2 , a spokesman for Boca Raton, Fla.-based GEO, said in an email his company supports public-private partnerships which "have been demonstrated to achieve significant cost savings for the taxpayers." He declined to answer specific questions.\par \par \uc2 But ICE Executive Associate Director for Enforcement and Removal Operations Gary Mead said the government has never studied whether privatizing immigrant detention saves money.\par \par \uc2 "They are not our most expensive, they are not our cheapest" facilities, he said. "At some point cost cannot be the only factor."\par \par \uc2 One fundamental difference between private detention facilities and their publicly-run counterparts is transparency. The private ones don't have to follow the same public records and access requirements.\par \par \uc2 President Barack Obama has asked for less detention money this year and encouraged the agency to look at alternatives to locking people up. He also ordered DHS to stop deporting young immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally, which could reduce the number behind bars. Congress, however, can approve more detention spending than DHS requests.\par \par \uc2 Beyond civil detention centers, private companies are also making more money locking up non-citizens who commit federal crimes.\par \par \uc2 To deter illegal border crossers, federal prosecutors are increasingly charging immigrants with felonies for repeatedly entering the country without papers. That has led thousands of people convicted of illegal re-entry, as well as more serious federal offenses, to serve time in private prisons built just for them.\par \par \uc2 A decade ago, more than 3,300 criminal immigrants were sent to private prisons under two 10-year contracts the \uc2 Federal Bureau of Prisons\uc2  signed with \uc2 CCA\uc2  worth $760 million. Now, the agency is paying the private companies $5.1 billion to hold more than 23,000 criminal immigrants through 13 contracts of varying lengths.\par \par \uc2 CCA\uc2  was on the verge of bankruptcy in 2000 due to lawsuits, management problems and dwindling contracts. Last year, the company reaped $162 million in net income. Federal contracts made up 43 percent of its total revenues, in part thanks to rising immigrant detention.\par \par \uc2 GEO, which cites the immigration agency as its largest client, saw its net income jump from $16.9 million to $78.6 million since 2000.\par \par \uc2 "Another factor driving growth ... for the private sector is in the area of immigration and illegal immigration specifically," Chief Financial Officer \uc2 Brian Evans\uc2  told investors in GEO's 2011 3rd quarter earnings call.\par \par \uc2 CCA\uc2  warned in its 2011 annual earnings report that federal policy changes in "illegal immigration could affect the number of persons arrested, convicted, and sentenced, thereby potentially reducing demand for correctional facilities to house them."\par \par \uc2 Utah-based Management and Training is not publicly held, so it does not post earnings.\par \par \uc2 At just the federal level, these companies, their political action committees and their employees have spent more than $32 million on lobbying and on campaign contributions since 2000 -- with the national political parties getting the largest campaign contributions.\par \par \uc2 An AP review of \uc2 Federal Election Commission\uc2  data found the prison companies and their employees gave to key congressional leaders who control how much money goes to run the nation's detention centers and who influence how many contracts go to the private sector.\par \par \uc2 James Thurber, head of American University's Center for Congressional & Presidential Studies, said amid the heated national debate over immigration, the companies have been savvy not to donate heavily to those sponsoring legislation, which could spark backlash, or to lobby directly for tougher laws.\par \par \uc2 "It's too controversial," he said. "But support for privatization doesn't get as political. And it can be done discretely."\par \par \uc2 There are more discrete and more powerful ways to influence policy, Thurber said.\par \par \uc2 "Follow the money," he said. "If the money is being increased significantly for illegal immigration, then that is a shift in policy ... a significant shift."\par \par \uc2 The top beneficiaries of the campaign contributions include:\par \par \uc2 -- The Republican Party. Its national and congressional committees received around $450,000. Democrats received less than half that.\par \par \uc2 -- Arizona Republican Sen. \uc2 John McCain\uc2 . He received $71,000, mostly during his failed presidential bid against Obama, well after he dropped support for a bill that would have given illegal immigrants a path to citizenship and reduced detentions.\par \par \uc2 -- House Speaker \uc2 John Boehner\uc2  received $63,000.\par \par \uc2 --Kentucky U.S. Rep. Hal Rogers received about $59,000. Rogers chaired the first subcommittee on Homeland Security and heads the powerful \uc2 House Appropriations Committee\uc2 . He often criticizes ICE for not filling more detention beds.\par \par \uc2 -- Former \uc2 U.S. Senate\uc2  Majority Leader Bill Frist. He received $58,500. The lawmaker from Tennessee, where \uc2 CCA\uc2  is headquartered, led the Senate at the height of the nation's immigrant detention build up from 2003 to 2007.\par \par \uc2 More than campaign contributions, though, the private prison companies spent most of their money each year on lobbying in Washington, peaking in 2005 when they spent $5 million.\par \par \uc2 In just 2011, \uc2 CCA\uc2  paid the Washington firm \uc2 Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld\uc2  $280,000 in part to "monitor immigration reform," federal reports show.\par \par \uc2 They also lobbied heavily against a bill that would force them to comply with the same open records requirements governing public facilities.\par \par \uc2 Owen, the CCA spokesman, said the company ramped up lobbying to acquaint new lawmakers with the industry.\par \par \uc2 "In recent years, federal elections have been very volatile, resulting in a lot of new faces in Washington," he said. "The result of that volatility means a lot of people at the federal level who may not be familiar with the work we do."\par \par \uc2 The prison companies' influence at the state level mirrors that in Washington, although the money is even harder to track since many states, such as Arizona and Illinois, where the companies have won lucrative detention contracts, don't require corporations to disclose what they pay lobbyists.\par \par \uc2 The AP reviewed campaign contribution data from the three companies' political action committees and their employees over the last decade, compiled by the National Institute on Money in State Politics. From 2003 to the first half of 2012, state candidates and political parties in the 50 states received more than $5.32 million.\par \par \uc2 In the 10 states where the companies' committees and employees contributed the most, the AP found they also spent at least $8 million more lobbying local officials in the last five years alone. It is impossible to know how much of this lobbying money was aimed only at immigrant-related contracts. But that money generally went to states along the border, such as Florida and Texas, which have high numbers of immigrants, as well as states such as Georgia and Louisiana, where large numbers of immigrants also are detained.\par \par \uc2 ICE has begun providing more oversight as part of the Obama administration's pledge to overhaul the nation's system for jailing immigration offenders. It recently scrapped plans for \uc2 CCA\uc2  to build a 1,500-bed immigrant detention center in a high-end Miami suburb following months of local protests, and is also looking for a new home for a detention facility once slated for the suburbs of Chicago, after local officials voted in June to block the project from going forward.\par \par \uc2 But it remains committed to adding more private beds. Plans are on track to build or expand private immigration jails in Newark, N.J., and along a lonely stretch of California's Mojave Desert.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Burke reported from San Francisco.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Follow on Twitter Laura Wides-Munoz: (at)lwmunoz and Garance Burke (at)garanceburke.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120802e8820012z\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 LOS ANGELES (AP) - As some states make it tougher for illegal immigrants to attend college, a new program is pledging to do the opposite.\par \par \uc2 A partnership between the University of California, Los Angeles Center for Labor Research and Education and the National Labor College on Monday announced a plan to offer online courses for college credit to young immigrant and labor rights activists.\par \par \uc2 The project -- called National Dream University -- was inspired by an effort last year in Georgia to reach out to \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students barred from area universities and President Obama's decision to grant temporary work permits to many young illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 "Students are getting motivated, they're having a newfound sense of hope they can go to college," said Alma Castrejon, the project's coordinator. "If they're not having this opportunity in their home state, they need someone to provide that."\par \par \uc2 About 35 students will be accepted to take six courses in 2013 on topics such as labor history and nonviolence and social movements, Castrejon said. Anyone interested in immigrant and labor rights can apply -- whether they have legal status or not, she said.\par \par \uc2 The year's coursework will cost $2,490. Students will be required to travel to Maryland and California at the beginning and end of the year but will complete their coursework and assignments online.\par \par \uc2 Applications are due Oct. 5.\par \par \uc2 Lisa Garcia-Bedolla, associate professor at University of California, Berkeley's graduate school of education, said she thought the program would draw students who couldn't otherwise afford to go to school because of rising tuition costs, living expenses and the difficulty of keeping a job while taking classes.\par \par \uc2 "I think people will take advantage of it because it's the only option for them," she said.\par \par \uc2 Jonathan Perez, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  student activist, said the topics appear geared to students who are involved in immigrant rights work, many who are likely already seeking a higher education.\par \par \uc2 Castrejon said students who complete the program will receive a certificate and can transfer the credits. If the program succeeds, it might be expanded to a two- or four-year degree, she said.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120731e87v0003v\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Sergio Garcia completed law school with the help of odd jobs and proceeds from a self-help book. Then he passed the state law exam on the first try.\par \par \uc2 But his goal to practice law in California remains unfulfilled because of his status as a Mexican immigrant living in the country without legal permission.\par \par \uc2 Garcia's case for admission to the state bar is now before the California Supreme Court, which will decide whether he should be allowed to practice law even though his immigration status makes employing him illegal.\par \par \uc2 California Attorney General Kamala Harris filed a brief with the court on Wednesday in support of Garcia's application. The court is also seeking input from the U.S. Department of Justice.\par \par \uc2 "Admitting Garcia to the bar would be consistent with state and federal policy that encourages immigrants, both documented and undocumented, to contribute to society," Harris wrote in her brief to the Supreme Court.\par \par \uc2 Garcia's attorney, Jerome Fishkin, said his client deserves the opportunity to practice law.\par \par \uc2 "Sergio is poster boy for the sort of immigrant that made this country great. He comes here, he works hard, he's not been on welfare, not taken student loans and worked his way all the way through," Fishkin said.\par \par \uc2 However, Larry DeSha, a former state bar prosecutor, said the issue comes down to whether or not Garcia can uphold his oath.\par \par \uc2 "It is the duty of an attorney to support the Constitution and laws of the United States and of this state. My argument is that includes immigration law, which means not being here illegally," DeSha said.\par \par \uc2 The 35-year-old Garcia, who lives in Durham, does not like to be referred to as an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . While he said he came unlawfully to the U.S. as a toddler with his parents, he applied for legal residency in 1995. His application is still pending 17 years later, after his father already became a citizen and his mother a permanent resident.\par \par \uc2 "It's a difficult position. It's like being in limbo. I don't belong anywhere," Garcia said in an interview on Thursday.\par \par \uc2 He didn't expect his immigration status to interfere with his aspirations to be a lawyer, he said, until the \uc2 State Bar of California\uc2  started asking for prospective applicants' immigration status right before he passed the bar exam. He told the State Bar his status was pending.\par \par \uc2 "I have done the best I can within my limitations and circumstances to be 100 percent honest and upfront," Garcia said.\par \par \uc2 The examiners of the \uc2 State Bar of California\uc2  have recommended that the California Supreme Court rule in favor of Garcia.\par \par \uc2 Fishkin said even though his client cannot legally be employed, it would not be illegal for clients to hire Garcia as an independent contractor.\par \par \uc2 The U.S. Department of Justice is expected to file its brief to the state Supreme Court in August.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120719e87j0025u\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

A specialist with the state agriculture department identified adult beetles Thursday after a city crew noticed several distressed trees, the Milwaukee \uc2 Journal Sentinel\uc2  reported ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://bit.ly/Mq1OuC"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://bit.ly/Mq1OuC}}}\uc2 ).\par \par \uc2 "The whole city is at risk," said David Sivyer, Milwaukee's forestry services manager.\par \par \uc2 Ash make up about 17 percent of Milwaukee's tree population.\par \par \uc2 "Treat them or remove and replace them with resistant-type shade trees before they become infested with the emerald ash borer," Mayor Tom Barrett said at a news conference in front of a home with three infested trees. "Without treatment, all unprotected ash trees are likely to become infested and killed by the emerald ash borer."\par \par \uc2 The invasive pest is responsible for the deaths of tens of millions of ash trees in the eastern U.S. and Canada, and has been found in 11 Wisconsin counties since 2008.\par \par \uc2 Barrett and Sivyer said options to help residents pay for removing trees are limited. If the city determines a tree on private property is dying from the pest, the city can order the property owners to remove the tree or the city will do it for them.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120714e87e00038\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHOENIX (AP) - U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has scaled back a unit in Phoenix that answers calls from local law enforcement to identify and deport illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 The move comes just as local authorities prepare to start enforcing Arizona's immigration law.\par \par \uc2 Some immigration-enforcement advocates are concerned that downsizing the unit could hamper the agency's ability to respond to local police, the Arizona Republic reports ( {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://bit.ly/NBSbuw"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://bit.ly/NBSbuw}}}\uc2 ).\par \par \uc2 State Rep. John Kavanagh, R-Fountain Hills, is among those who foresee potential problems. He is one of the main backers of the Arizona law.\par \par \uc2 "Secondary to ICE's ability to respond is the concern that the Obama administration has ordered them, even if they have the personnel, not to respond to any suspected \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  unless that individual has a serious criminal record or has previously been deported. That's the number one enforcement problem," he said.\par \par \uc2 In June, the federal agency began reassigning members of the Law Enforcement Agency Response unit, or LEAR, to help round up illegal immigrants in others states.\par \par \uc2 Human smuggling activity in the Phoenix area is down and the agency has been shifting priorities to focus on deporting the most dangerous illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Agency spokeswoman Amber Cargile said priorities include convicted criminals, illegal immigrants who have been deported from the country but re-entered and recent border crossers.\par \par \uc2 Phoenix Police Sgt. Tommy Thompson said his department hasn't noticed a change yet in the agency's ability or willingness to respond.\par \par \uc2 "We still have to wait and see if that is going to be the case," he said.\par \par \uc2 The U.S. Supreme Court in June let stand the provision in Arizona's law that allows police to try to determine the immigration status of people they stop or arrest if they have a reasonable suspicion that they're in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 Under the ruling, police could potentially violate a person's constitutional rights if the suspect is detained for longer than he or she would have been for regular questioning.\par \par \uc2 The law could take effect after July 20, once lower courts lift an injunction that has been in place since July 2010.\par \par \uc2 Phoenix is still the only city in the country with a LEAR unit. Created in 2006, it included a supervisor and eight to 10 officers available to respond at all times, said Phil Crawford, who at the time was the field director of deportation and removal operations.\par \par \uc2 At the time, the agency was being inundated with requests for help from the state, Phoenix police and other local agencies in Maricopa County. Those agencies routinely encountered smuggling vehicles loaded with suspected illegal immigrants or drophouses used by smugglers to hold illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Crawford said the unit was effective at helping local police combat human-smuggling organizations that were using the Phoenix area as a hub for transporting illegal immigrants to other parts of the country.\par \par \uc2 Agency statistics show the number of calls for assistance from local police has been falling steadily.\par \par \uc2 In the last fiscal year, the unit received 1,136 calls from federal, state and local law-enforcement agencies. That was down 34 percent from 2008.\par \par \uc2 In 2011, calls to the unit resulted in 2,878 arrests, down 63 percent from the 7,752 in 2008.\par \par \uc2 Calls for assistance are on pace to be even lower this year. From October through May, the unit has received 520 calls, resulting in 1,133 arrests.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Information from: The Arizona Republic, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.azcentral.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.azcentral.com}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120714e87e001zm\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

(AP) - Lawmakers are pushing for the state to offer college tuition assistance to citizens -- even if their parents are living in the U.S. without permission.\par \par \uc2 A bill was introduced in both chambers of the state Legislature after a U.S.-born high school student sued the state last year claiming she had been denied tuition assistance because her mother is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Assemblywoman Marlene Caride, a Democrat from West New York, announced Friday that she had introduced a bill last month to rectify that.\par \par \uc2 "College is terribly expensive," Caride said. "We should be looking for ways to make it more affordable for our students, not costlier."\par \par \uc2 She called the situation for students born in the United States to parents who are in the country illegally "difficult and unfair."\par \par \uc2 Under the bill, students would be eligible for grants, loans and scholarships from the New Jersey Higher Education Student Assistance Authority if they are U.S. citizens who have lived in the U.S. for at least a year and their parents show that they are paying state and federal income taxes.\par \par \uc2 An identical bill was introduced in the state Senate in March and was moved out of the Senate's higher education committee in May.\par \par \uc2 Last year, a 17-year-old student, identified in court papers only by the initials A.Z., got help from the \uc2 American Civil Liberties Union\uc2  and a Rutgers University legal clinic and sued the state, saying her aid application was rejected because "her parents are not legal New Jersey residents."\par \par \uc2 The court case is pending.\par \par \uc2 In June 2010, HESAA officials said students -- or, if they are not legally adults, their parents -- have to prove they have been "domiciled" in New Jersey for at least a year before they can get aid.\par \par \uc2 The ACLU said A.Z. and other students were rejected for help because the agency defined "domiciled" to mean the person had to be a legal U.S. resident.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120713e87d0022e\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 YANGON, Myanmar (AP) - The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees on Thursday rejected a suggestion by Myanmar's president that the world body resettle or take care of ethnic Rohingyas who have settled in the Southeast Asian country.\par \par \uc2 UNHCR chief Antonio Guterres told reporters it was not his agency's job to resettle the Rohingya, who live in western Myanmar but without Myanmar citizenship.\par \par \uc2 On his website, President Thein Sein said he told Guterres in a meeting Wednesday that the solution to ethnic enmity in Myanmar's western Rakhine state was to either send the Rohingya to a third country or have the UNHCR look after them.\par \par \uc2 Clashes last month between Buddhist Rakhines and Muslin Rohingya left at least 78 people dead and tens of thousands homeless. The Rakhine consider the Rohingya to be illegal immigrants from neighboring Bangladesh.\par \par \uc2 Thein Sein described the violence at the time as a threat to the democratic and economic reforms his government launched after decades of repressive rule by a military junta.\par \par \uc2 "The resettlement programs organized by UNHCR are for refugees who are fleeing a country to another, in very specific circumstances. Obviously, it's not related to this situation," said Guterres.\par \par \uc2 Thein Sein's reported suggestion to Guterres left unclear exactly how many people he had in mind. The U.N. estimates there are about 800,000 Rohingya in Myanmar. The count includes people of Bengali heritage who settled centuries ago, as well as people who may have entered the country in recent decades.\par \par \uc2 Many people in Myanmar don't recognize as legitimate settlers even those of Bengali heritage who came in the 19th century, when Myanmar was under British rule and called Burma.\par \par \uc2 Large exoduses of Rohingya to Bangladesh in the 1980s and 1990s because of persecution, and their subsequent return, also add to the confusion over who is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Thein Sein told Guterres that according to Myanmar law, those Bengalis who settled in Myanmar before the country gained independence from Britain in 1948 and their children are regarded as citizens. However, post-independence immigrants are officially considered illegal and threatening to the country's stability.\par \par \uc2 In practice, it is difficult for many people of Bengali heritage to obtain citizenship, and they face discriminatory legal restrictions on movement, marriage and reproduction.\par \par \uc2 "We will take responsibility of our ethnic nationals but it is impossible to accept those Rohingyas who are not our ethnic nationals who had entered the country illegally. The only solution is to hand those illegal Rohingyas to the UNHCR or to send them to any third country that would accept them," Thein Sein told Guterres, according to his website.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020120712e87c001tr\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SAN DIEGO (AP) - A man who saw an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Mexico get shot with a stun gun by U.S. border authorities said he testified Thursday to a federal grand jury amid signs that prosecutors are considering criminal charges in the immigrant's death after more than two years of silence on the politically charged case.\par \par \uc2 Humberto Navarrete told The Associated Press that he testified for about 90 minutes at a San Diego courthouse and told the grand jury he thought the border officials' actions were excessive. The grand jury questioned Navarrete about what he saw and viewed a grainy video that he took on his cellphone.\par \par \uc2 Navarrete's video, which he released immediately after the May 2010 incident at San Diego's San Ysidro port of entry, captured audio of a man believed to be Anastasio Hernandez pleading for help and passers-by asking border authorities to leave him alone.\par \par \uc2 "He was lying face-down on the ground, surrounded by agents," Navarrete, a 26-year-old San Diego resident, said he told the grand jury.\par \par \uc2 The U.S. \uc2 Justice Department's civil rights division\uc2  has been presenting evidence to the grand jury on Hernandez's death, family attorney Eugene Iredale told the AP.\par \par \uc2 A person other than Iredale who is close to the Hernandez family said a man who was with Navarrete that night also was expected to testify Thursday. The person, who spoke directly with the witness, requested anonymity because grand jury proceedings are supposed to be secret.\par \par \uc2 Mitchell Rivard, a Justice Department spokesman, said the case remains under investigation and declined further comment.\par \par \uc2 Agents shot Hernandez, 42, with a stun gun at the busy border crossing while returning him to Tijuana, Mexico. Mexican President Felipe Calderon joined a chorus of critics who complained of excessive force by U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials, none of whom have been publicly identified.\par \par \uc2 An autopsy by the San Diego County coroner's office found Hernandez died of a heart attack, with a heart condition and methamphetamine use listed as contributing factors. The autopsy said Hernandez was unresponsive shortly after he was shot with a stun gun, apparently three or four times.\par \par \uc2 The coroner's report, citing a San Diego police detective, said Hernandez was "agitated and confrontational" after he was detained by Border Patrol agents crossing the border illegally and became "suddenly violent" when his handcuffs were removed at the border crossing.\par \par \uc2 It is unclear if the evidence being presented to the grand jury will lead to criminal charges or who is the target of the investigation. Still, the convening of a grand jury suggests the government is interested in bringing charges.\par \par \uc2 "When a prosecutor looks at a case, you can decide no crime has been committed, you close the case and move on. That obviously hasn't happened in this case," said Peter Nunez, a former U.S. attorney in San Diego who is not involved in the case. "The fact that there's a grand jury means it has progressed to the next level, if you will."\par \par \uc2 Nunez cautioned that prosecutors may have determined there wasn't enough evidence to justify charges but sought political cover with a grand jury.\par \par \uc2 "This case has so much publicity attached to it," he said. "You can see a prosecutor saying, `There's not enough evidence to justify criminal charges ... I'm going to present the case to the grand jury, with the idea that the grand jury may decide not to indict.' The prosecutors are shielded from criticism to some degree."\par \par \uc2 Hernandez's widow welcomed news of the grand jury investigation.\par \par \uc2 "It has been more than two years of waiting. I believe this is a step toward justice," Maria Pugo, 41, said at a news conference Thursday with migrant activists who also applauded the move and said they hoped for an indictment.\par \par \uc2 "We're pleased with this initial step in the right direction," said Andrea Guerrero, executive director of Equality Alliance. "It's long overdue."\par \par \uc2 The investigation attracted renewed scrutiny and criticism less than three months ago after another eyewitness video that aired on PBS appeared to show Hernandez being shot with a stun gun while lying on the ground, surrounded by about a dozen agents. Sixteen members of Congress wrote Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano to say Hernandez's death "may be emblematic of broader structural problems."\par \par \uc2 It is extremely rare for U.S. border authorities to face criminal charges for deaths or injuries to migrants. In April, federal prosecutors said there was insufficient evidence to pursue charges against a Border Patrol agent in the 2010 shooting death of a 15-year-old Mexican in Texas.\par \par \uc2 The decision to present evidence to a grand jury and potentially charge Customs and Border Protection officials comes at a time when the Justice Department and Attorney General Eric Holder are under intense criticism from Republicans for a botched gun-tracking operation known as Fast and Furious. In that operation, agents of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives in Arizona abandoned the usual practice of intercepting all weapons they believed to be illicitly purchased.\par \par \uc2 The agents in Fast and Furious lost track of several hundred weapons. In 2010, Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry was killed in a firefight with a group of armed Mexican bandits and two guns traced to the operation were found at the scene.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par
