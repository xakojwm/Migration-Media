The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) - An appeals court has backed up an Albuquerque police officer's search of an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  during a routine traffic stop, disagreeing with attorneys who argued that the lawman's search went too far.\par \par \uc2 At issue was Officer Joe Moreno's search of suspect Ivan Rochin last January.\par \par \uc2 The Albuquerque Journal reports ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://bit.ly/uVm7OI"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://bit.ly/uVm7OI}}}\uc2 ) that Moreno pulled Rochin over for having a suspended car registration, did a pat-down and felt a bulge in Rochin's pants pocket that he asked Rochin to identify.\par \par \uc2 When Rochin refused, Moreno reached in his pocket and found a glass pipe and marijuana. He also found a gun inside Rochin's car. Rochin was later charged in federal court with being an alien in possession of a firearm and ammunition.\par \par \uc2 Judge James Browning ruled that Moreno had reasonable suspicion to believe that Rochin was armed and dangerous at the beginning of the pat-down and refused to grant a request by the defense not to allow prosecutors to use the results of Moreno's search during trial.\par \par \uc2 Rochin's attorney, Brian Pori, didn't contest the initial stop, only the continued search of Rochin's pockets and appealed the case to the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals.\par \par \uc2 The court issued an opinion on Dec. 13 upholding Moreno's decision and Rochin's conviction, saying that "routine" traffic stops often are anything but that and that officers are killed after pulling someone over for even minor infractions.\par \par \uc2 "The Fourth Amendment is not a game of blind man's bluff," Appeals Court Judge Neil Gorsuch wrote in response to the defense argument that an officer may not take objects from a suspect's pockets when he had no idea what they were. "It doesn't require an officer to risk his safety or the safety of those nearby while he fishes around in a suspect's pockets until he can correctly guess the identity and risks association with an unknown object."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Information from: Albuquerque Journal, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.abqjournal.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.abqjournal.com}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020111226e7cq0023k\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

It wasn't known if he had retained a lawyer.\par \par \uc2 Authorities say the arrest came after police conducted a road block near the accident scene. They soon learned a van -- covered by a tarp -- had been parked at a nearby home since the night the accident occurred.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020111224e7co00223\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - A fourth defendant in one of New Jersey's most notorious murder cases pleaded guilty Friday to taking part in the attack but not causing the deaths of the three victims.\par \par \uc2 Shahid Baskerville was one of six men and boys charged in the execution-style slayings of three college friends in a Newark schoolyard in 2007. A fourth victim was shot, stabbed and sexually assaulted but survived.\par \par \uc2 Appearing in state Superior Court, Baskerville pleaded guilty to robbery, conspiracy and aggravated sexual contact in exchange for having murder and felony murder charges dropped. He will serve at least 85 percent of a 30-year prison sentence.\par \par \uc2 Baskerville, who has been in custody since shortly after the murders occurred, was 15 when Dashon Harvey, Iofemi Hightower and Terrance "T.J." Aeriel were killed. The Associated Press isn't identifying the fourth victim because of the sexual assault charges. All four were enrolled or about to enroll at Delaware State University.\par \par \uc2 The brutal murders -- at least two victims were slashed with a machete before three were lined up against a wall and shot -- stunned Newark, a city already plagued by gun violence. The public outcry led to the fast-tracking of several anti-crime measures, including surveillance cameras on city streets.\par \par \uc2 Two of the defendants have already been convicted of murder, and a third pleaded guilty last year. All are serving consecutive life sentences.\par \par \uc2 Baskerville is expected to testify against Jose Carranza, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Peru whom other defendants have said wielded the machete during the attack. Carranza's trial is scheduled to begin next month.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020111223e7cn001zg\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

(AP) - A 93-year-old woman who cleaned the state Capitol for 30 years, including the governor's office, is concerned that she won't be able to vote next year for the first time in decades.\par \par \uc2 Thelma Mitchell told WSMV-TV that she went to a state drivers' license center last week after being told that her old state ID from her cleaning job would not meet new regulations for voter identification ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://bit.ly/tVUFjr"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://bit.ly/tVUFjr}}}\uc2 ).\par \par \uc2 Mitchell, who was delivered by a midwife in Alabama in 1918, has never had a birth certificate. But when she told that to a drivers' license clerk, he suggested she might be an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 But a spokesman for the House Republican Caucus said Mitchell was given bad information. Brent Leatherwood said even an expired state ID will allow her to vote.\par \par \uc2 Asked about why Mitchell might have been confused or received incorrect information about the new voter ID law, Leatherwood said only that the provision that allows for the use of state employee IDs is "pretty straight-forward."\par \par \uc2 He said staff would be contacting Mitchell to get to the bottom of the miscommunication.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Information from: WSMV-TV, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsmv.com/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.wsmv.com/}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020111223e7cn001jg\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) - The U.S. Secretary of Labor is criticizing Alabama's new immigration law and reminding workers in the state they have the right to be paid the federal minimum wage, regardless of their immigration status.\par \par \uc2 Secretary Hilda Solis is also encouraging anyone denied the federal minimum wage or overtime pay to contact the Department of Labor at (205) 397-7114 or {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.dol.gov"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.dol.gov}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "Our federal government -- under both Republican and Democratic presidents -- has long held that all people working in this country have the right to the federal minimum wage, regardless of immigration status," Solis wrote in a post on the department's blog. She said Alabama's immigration law invalidates employment contracts for illegal immigrants who are guaranteed the federal minimum wage under the federal Fair Labor Standards Act.\par \par \uc2 In response, the sponsor of Alabama's immigration law, Republican Rep. Micky Hammon of Decatur, said, "The truth is that illegal immigration brings its own set of human rights abuses ranging from human trafficking to poverty level wages to the victimization that comes with living under the radar."\par \par \uc2 Solis criticized Alabama's law for making it a crime for an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  to enter into a business transaction, such as signing an apartment lease or getting utility service. "Imprisoning those who seek shelter and basic sustenance runs counter to the universal rights of all free people. It's beneath the dignity of this great nation," she wrote.\par \par \uc2 Solis is the latest member of the Democratic president's administration to speak out against the law, which Alabama's Republican-controlled Legislature enacted in June. The Justice Department is challenging the law in federal court, along with about 30 organizations and individuals.\par \par \uc2 One of those groups says it has received complaints about employers refusing to pay illegal immigrants for work they've done.\par \par \uc2 "Some employers just think these are people who will not complain," Mary Bauer, attorney for the Southern Poverty Law Center, told The Birmingham News.\par \par \uc2 Hammon said the Obama administration is putting its emphasis in the wrong place. "If the Obama administration spent its time working to secure our borders rather than fighting Alabama's immigration statute, there would not be a need for our law in the first place," he said Friday.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Online:\par \par \uc2 Department of Labor blog: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://social.dol.gov/blog/universal-rights-extend-to-alabama/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://social.dol.gov/blog/universal-rights-extend-to-alabama/}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020111223e7cn001hb\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

(AP) -- In the little town of Bethlehem, a cloistered nun whose luminous blue eyes entranced Elvis Presley in his first on-screen movie kiss is praying for a Christmas miracle.\par \par \uc2 Dolores Hart, who walked away from Hollywood stardom in 1963 to become a nun in rural Bethlehem, Conn., now finds herself back in the spotlight. But this time it's all about serving the King of Kings, not smooching the King of Rock and Roll.\par \par \uc2 The former brass factory that houses Mother Dolores and about 40 other nuns cloistered at the Abbey of Regina Laudis needs millions of dollars in renovations to meet fire and safety codes, add an elevator and make handicap accessibility upgrades.\par \par \uc2 Like 73-year-old Mother Dolores, the order's nuns have taken a vow of stability with the intent to live, work and die at the complex. The order was established in 1947 in Bethlehem, a small burg in Connecticut's rolling western hills.\par \par \uc2 Now, the historically self-supporting nuns have launched a fundraiser for the $4 million renovation project dubbed "New Horizons." They don't have much money, but they have Mother Dolores: a starlet-turned-supplicant whose unique story might lure the attention and donations of generations of movie fans, particularly those who adore all things Elvis.\par \par \uc2 "This work may not be in my lifetime that it's finished, but we're sure trying," Mother Dolores said of the upgrades, which are budgeted to run about $2 million for the fire code and accessibility compliance work and another $2 million for improvements to the housing and other facilities.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Girl, 9, was feared missing after flight change\par \par \uc2 HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- A 9-year-old girl flying by herself to visit her grandmother had to change planes unexpectedly and \uc2 Southwest Airlines\uc2  did not tell her parents, sending relatives into a panic.\par \par \uc2 Chloe Boyce took off from Tennessee on Tuesday, bound for LaGuardia Airport in New York. Bad weather forced her plane to detour, and then she had to change planes. When the plane she was initially on arrived at LaGuardia, family members said it took close to an hour to locate her.\par \par \uc2 "When I got the text (from her mother) that she wasn't on the plane, and Southwest doesn't know where she is, I started freaking out," said Joseph Kerr, the girl's stepfather.\par \par \uc2 Southwest spokesman Brad Hawkins said the airline apologized to the family for not letting them know she had changed planes and would be delayed.\par \par \uc2 Chloe, of Clarksville, Tenn., was accompanied by Southwest employees during her trip, but she said she was a little nervous because nobody told her why she had to get off the plane in Baltimore.\par \par \uc2 "I was like `I'm supposed to be getting off at LaGuardia. I'm not supposed to get off this plane,'" she said.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Haslam: Insurance exchange delay could be costly\par \par \uc2 NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Governor Bill Haslam says delay in setting up a state health insurance exchange could make Tennessee miss out on federal grants to help pay for it.\par \par \uc2 The exchanges represent half of President Obama's strategy for expanding coverage to more than 30 million uninsured people. Some people will pick a plan through a state exchange, while others will be covered through Medicaid.\par \par \uc2 Senate Speaker Ron Ramsey has said he would like to wait until next December to set up the exchange. That would let lawmakers put off the vote until after the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled on the health care overhaul. It will also be after next year's election.\par \par \uc2 But Haslam told WPLN-FM that under Ramsey's plan the state would miss a deadline for federal grants ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://bit.ly/vyUqrI"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://bit.ly/vyUqrI}}}\uc2 ).\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Former Capitol Hill maid says can't get voter ID\par \par \uc2 NASHVILLE, Tenn.

But when she told that to a drivers' license clerk, he suggested she might be an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 But a spokesman for the House Republican Caucus said Mitchell was given bad information. Brent Leatherwood said even an expired state ID will allow her to vote.\par \par \uc2 Asked about why Mitchell might have been confused or received incorrect information about the new voter ID law, Leatherwood said only that the provision that allows for the use of state employee IDs is "pretty straight-forward."\par \par \uc2 He said staff would be contacting Mitchell to get to the bottom of the miscommunication.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020111223e7cn0012e\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ATLANTA (AP) - A federal appeals court on Thursday denied requests by Georgia and Alabama to delay action on legal challenges to their tough new laws targeting illegal immigration pending the outcome of a U.S. Supreme Court decision on a similar challenge to Arizona's immigration law.\par \par \uc2 The 11th U.S. Circuit of Appeals issued orders denying motions filed last week by the attorneys general of the two states.\par \par \uc2 "We look forward to the oral argument and the future decision by the Court," said Lauren Kane, spokeswoman for Georgia Attorney General Sam Olens.\par \par \uc2 Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange had no immediate comment on the court order Thursday, his office said.\par \par \uc2 Both Olens and Strange had said last week that the \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2 's ruling in Arizona would be relevant to the consideration of the appeals in their cases.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Supreme Court\uc2  said Dec. 12 that it would review a federal appeals court ruling that blocked parts of the Arizona law. One part requires that police, while enforcing other laws, question a person's immigration status if officers suspect he or she is in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 The Obama administration challenged the Arizona law, arguing that regulating immigration is the job of the federal government, not states. The Department of Justice also challenged similar laws in Alabama, South Carolina and Utah. Civil liberties and immigrant rights groups also sued over measures in those states, as well as in Georgia and Indiana.\par \par \uc2 Karen Tumlin, a lawyer for the National Immigration Law Center, which is arguing the cases in both Alabama and Georgia, said she was pleased.\par \par \uc2 "We're happy that those cases will move forward," she said, adding that she doesn't believe the outcome of the Arizona case will resolve all of the questions in the Georgia and Alabama cases.\par \par \uc2 The groups challenging the laws had not opposed Georgia's request for delayed action, because they were satisfied with the lower court's ruling temporarily blocking parts of the law.\par \par \uc2 A federal judge in June temporarily blocked parts of Georgia's law pending the outcome of a legal challenge filed by immigrant rights and civil liberties groups. One blocked section would authorize police to check the immigration status of suspects who don't have proper identification. The other would create a state penalty for people who knowingly and willingly transport or harbor illegal immigrants while committing another crime.\par \par \uc2 The groups had filed a motion opposing Alabama's request for a stay because parts of the law they had challenged have already taken effect.\par \par \uc2 After a federal judge in Alabama declined to block many provisions, the 11th Circuit temporarily blocked parts of the law, including a requirement for schools to check students' immigration status. But the appeals court left intact a section that allows police to check a person's immigration status during a traffic stop and to detain someone they believe is in the country illegally. Courts also can't enforce contracts involving illegal immigrants, such as leases, and it's a felony for an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  to do business with the state for basic things such as getting a driver's license.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writers Greg Bluestein in Atlanta and Bob Johnson in Montgomery, Ala., contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 5\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020111222e7cm001qp\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 McALLEN, Texas (AP) - A 14-year-old Texas boy shot while trying out for his school basketball team lost a kidney but should recover to live a normal life, his doctors said.\par \par \uc2 Edson Amaro sustained massive injuries earlier this month when he and Nicholas Tijerina were shot outside Harwell Middle School near Edinburg in South Texas. The boys were in a parking lot that had been converted into a temporary basketball court.\par \par \uc2 Doctors at Rio Grande Regional Hospital discussed Edson's condition during a news conference Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 Edson was shot in the back and the bullet went through a large vein, his stomach, his liver and his right kidney, said Dr. Carlos Garcia-Cantu, director of trauma services at the hospital. The kidney was removed in a five-hour surgery, but Edson is recovering and could make it home for the holidays, he said.\par \par \uc2 "I know my son Edson has a long recovery road ahead of him, but in the meantime I am happy he is recovering nicely and will look forward to the possibility of spending the holidays at home," Edson's father, Pedro Amaro, said in a statement released to the media Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, 13-year-old Nicholas has been unable to move his legs. His doctor said last week that he has been stable and talking, but that it's too soon to know the lasting effects of the shooting. The bullet entered the lower portion of Nicholas' chest under his right arm, damaging the lower portion of his lung. It went through the right half of his liver and through one of the bones of his spine before lodging in the soft tissue of his back.\par \par \uc2 About 50 students were trying out for the middle school basketball team when the shots rang out the afternoon of Dec. 12. Classes were out, but many children remained on the rural campus for extracurricular activities.\par \par \uc2 No charges have been filed in the shooting, but rifles have been seized from three men found on adjacent ranchland after the incident.\par \par \uc2 Investigators questioned the men, releasing two who had been practicing target shooting nearly a mile from the school.\par \par \uc2 The third man was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  with an assault rifle who was trespassing on the property, authorities said. He was kept in custody on charges of misdemeanor trespass and poaching.\par \par \uc2 Authorities are trying to determine which, if any, of the rifles fired the shots. Investigators were waiting for the results of ballistic testing on a bullet removed from the 14-year-old.\par \par \uc2 Earlier this week, a lawyer for the school district said authorities had previously responded to reports of gunfire around the middle school. She said they only confirmed that shots had been heard from afar. The school district contacted an adjacent landowner who said he would no longer allow hunting on the land.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020111222e7cm001oh\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 McALLEN, Texas (AP) - Authorities had previously responded to reports of gunfire around the South Texas middle school where two teen boys were shot last week on an outdoor basketball court, the school district's lawyer said Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 The local sheriff's office, constable and school district police responded to Harwell Middle School on the earlier occasion, but only confirmed that shots from afar had been heard, said Renee Rodriguez-Betancourt, attorney for the Edinburg Consolidated Independent School District.\par \par \uc2 "There were shots heard from afar," Rodriguez-Betancourt said. "There weren't shots at the school or anything of that matter." Reached while out of town, she said she did not recall the exact date of the earlier incident.\par \par \uc2 After the boys were shot Dec. 12, investigators questioned three men who were found on adjacent ranchland. Two were practicing target shooting and were in line with the students. A third was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  with an assault rifle who was trespassing.\par \par \uc2 Nicholas Tijerina, 13, was left with no movement in his legs after the bullet passed through a lung, his liver and a bone in his spine. The 14-year-old boy's identity has not been released, but he was reportedly stable. The boys were among about 50 kids trying out for the school's basketball team in a parking lot converted to a basketball court behind the school.\par \par \uc2 The McAllen Monitor first reported the earlier incident Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 On that occasion school administrators contacted the superintendent, who sent another administrator to investigate, Rodriguez-Betancourt said. The Hidalgo County Sheriff's Office was the first agency to respond, but the school district police and constable were also involved, she said.\par \par \uc2 "We spoke to the landowner, he assured us that he wasn't going to allow hunting and that the hunting that was previously done wasn't going to be done anymore and he wasn't going to allow it because of the school area being around there," Rodriguez-Betancourt said.\par \par \uc2 Sheriff Lupe Trevino said he would neither confirm nor deny the earlier incident. Generally, he said if his deputies respond to a school they defer to police unless it appears to be a major crime involving injuries or significant loss of property.\par \par \uc2 If something did occur "days and days" before the Dec. 12 shooting, it would not be part of their evidence so someone else would have to release it, he said.\par \par \uc2 School district Superintendent Rene Gutierrez did not immediately respond to messages left on his cell phone seeking comment. The school district police chief also did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment. The district offices are closed this week for the winter break.\par \par \uc2 School board President Carmen Gonzalez declined to comment, citing an open investigation.\par \par \uc2 Investigators are awaiting the results of ballistic testing in hopes of matching one of the bullets fired to one of the rifles.\par \par \uc2 "We've identified the exact location where the shots came from," Trevino said. He had previously said investigators believed the target shooters were about 800 yards or nearly a half mile from the students, but Tuesday Trevino said their location was just short of a mile from the school.\par \par \uc2 "We've identified the people who might be responsible for it. I think we even identified the weapon," he said. "The only thing that we are lacking at this point is being able to match the projectile to a weapon. Once we do that then that pretty much drives that last nail."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020111220e7ck001ly\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) - A federal judge said Monday he will rule by Dec. 31 whether to block any or all portions of South Carolina's tough new immigration law from taking effect New Year's Day. But he swiftly denied the state's request that the law proceed as scheduled.\par \par \uc2 The U.S. Justice Department and civil rights groups want an injunction blocking the law's Jan. 1 start, arguing that it's unconstitutional and interferes with federal law. The federal government is challenging fewer sections than the American Civil Liberties Union, which wants the entire law thrown out.\par \par \uc2 U.S. District Judge Richard Gergel denied the state's request that he suspend all court hearings on the case until the U.S. Supreme Court rules on a challenge to Arizona's similar law.\par \par \uc2 Deputy Attorney General Emory Smith said the nation's high court will likely rule in six months or less.\par \par \uc2 But if the South Carolina law violates someone's rights, "even a day of violation is too long," Gergel said. "Any injury could start Jan. 1."\par \par \uc2 His questioning of an ACLU attorney indicated he would not block the entire law. Doing so would knock out sections that are clearly lawful, he said, pointing to the mandate that all businesses check their new hires' legal status through a federal online system. Businesses that knowingly violate the law could have their operating licenses revoked.\par \par \uc2 He also specified as "a good thing" the section directing state law enforcement to enter a federal cooperative program that effectively deputizes local officers to enforce federal immigration laws on the streets and in jails.\par \par \uc2 Both the federal government and civil rights groups want to halt the section requiring police to question a person's immigration status if officers suspect the individual is in the country illegally. The questioning must follow a stop or arrest for something else. The measure bars officers from holding someone solely on that suspicion.\par \par \uc2 Opponents railed against the measure as encouraging racial profiling.\par \par \uc2 Gergel repeatedly referred to it as the "traffic dragnet."\par \par \uc2 "The state doesn't like me calling it a traffic dragnet, but that's what it is," he said.\par \par \uc2 The state's attorneys argued that officers can call federal authorities about a suspect's immigration status now. But Gergel responded that the difference is the law mandates it for "every traffic stop, every street encounter," vastly expanding the targets. He questioned whether the state law fundamentally alters the federal government's decision to focus limited resources on illegal immigrants who are terrorists, gang members and other criminals.\par \par \uc2 Gergel is also considering sections that charge an immigrant with a state crime for not carrying paperwork on their legal status, and make it a crime for illegal immigrants to transport or house themselves.\par \par \uc2 While federal law also requires that immigrants be able to produce paperwork, the federal government has decided not to enforce it, so South Carolina is attempting to supersede on the matter, said ACLU attorney Andre Segura.\par \par \uc2 Gergel pointed out that missionaries, victims of trafficking, women who are victims of violence and immigrants seeking asylum are here lawfully, and could be going through the process of being documented, but lack registration.\par \par \uc2 "Someone's seeking asylum because he's being tortured in his own country ... and we're going to pull him over on the way to Piggly Wiggly and throw him in jail?" Gergel asked.\par \par \uc2 He said the new state crime of harboring oneself is an obvious, dressed-up version of making it a crime to be an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , rather than a civil violation under federal law.\par \par \uc2 Unlike the federal government, the civil rights groups also are challenging a section that makes it a felony for someone to make fake documents for illegal immigrants. The civil rights coalition includes the ACLU, Southern Poverty Law Center, the National Immigration Law Center, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, and the South Carolina Appleseed Legal Justice Center.\par \par \uc2 Gergel discounted the state's argument that the federal government doesn't have the authority to sue, incredulously asking if the state believes the federal government has no right to come into federal court and argue a state law preempts its authority on immigration and foreign policy. He said surely the state knows that's not right.\par \par \uc2 "As a practical matter, there's got to be one cook in the kitchen," he said.\par \par \uc2 Gergel also chastised the tone of filings by civil rights groups, calling it unnecessary to suggest that legislators acted out of meanness.\par \par \uc2 "I know all these legislators. It's a small state. They acted in good faith," he said. "They may have gotten it wrong."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020111219e7cj0017f\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 McALLEN, Texas (AP) - A 13-year-old, one of two Texas boys shot while trying out for their middle school basketball team on an outdoor court, is unable to move his legs, his doctor said Friday.\par \par \uc2 Nicholas Tijerina, a student in the seventh grade at Harwell Middle School northeast of Edinburg, has been stable and talking, but it's too soon to know the lasting effects of Monday's shooting, said Dr. Mark Lieser, a trauma surgeon at McAllen Medical Center.\par \par \uc2 "He has been awake and alert and stable the entire time and that bleeding at this time appears to have stopped," Lieser said. "He's in remarkably good spirits and he's having an ice cream sundae for breakfast this morning."\par \par \uc2 Nicholas and a 14-year-old boy who has not been identified were in a parking lot that had been converted into a temporary basketball court behind the school when they were shot about 4:45 p.m. Monday. About 50 children were trying out for the school's team. The other boy is reportedly in stable condition at another hospital.\par \par \uc2 The bullet entered the lower portion of Nicholas' chest under his right arm damaging the lower portion of his lung, went through the right half of his liver and through one of the bones of his spine before lodging in the soft tissue of his back, Lieser said. "It was probably a pretty high-velocity round, which even if it didn't go right through the spinal cord went right next to it, and it's just the energy from that bullet is going to cause some damage to the spinal cord," he said.\par \par \uc2 Investigators have questioned three men who were found on adjacent ranchland after the shooting Monday evening. Two were practicing target shooting about a half mile from the school. A third was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  with an assault rifle who was trespassing on the property. The target shooters were released, but are still under investigation. The other man, charged with misdemeanor trespass and poaching, remained in custody. Investigators didn't know if any of them fired the shots, but hoped to have ballistic test results next week.\par \par \uc2 Hidalgo County Sheriff Lupe Trevino said Wednesday that investigators were leaning toward it being a target shooting incident rather than a hunting incident.\par \par \uc2 With no Texas law prohibiting hunting on private land near a school and high-powered rifles that can fire more than a mile, school officials have said the most immediate way to protect students might be building a cinder-block wall around two sides of the school to protect it from flying bullets.\par \par \uc2 Donna Tijerina, Nicholas' mother, said she had spoken with the school district's superintendent but hadn't had the energy to be angry.\par \par \uc2 "The only thing I want is for him to get better, just walk out of here the fantastic kid that I know he is," she said at a news conference with his doctors Friday.\par \par \uc2 Nicholas is an active kid who plays football, basketball and baseball. His football teammates signed a ball and gave it to him and his basketball coach told him he'd be an honorary member of the team and get his own jersey, his mother said.\par \par \uc2 She credited his basketball coach and the school nurse for their quick response that likely saved his life.\par \par \uc2 "When he was in the ER room he said, `Mom, I know I'm hurt. How long am I going to be here? When do I get to go back to school?' And when his coach came he said, `Am I still going to get credit for being on the basketball team?'" Donna Tijerina said. She said he's worried about falling behind in school. "His concern is he's 13 and he has so many friends and he's so active that he just wants to get back to school and be a normal kid again."\par \par \uc2 His coach called Donna Tijerina five minutes after he went down and initially told her he was complaining of abdominal pain and couldn't get up. But a few minutes later, when she was on her way to the school, he called back to tell her Nicholas had been shot and was on his way to the hospital. She said the shots were audible and Nicholas remembered seeing the other boy who was hit.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020111216e7cg001ud\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 MONTEBELLO, Calif. (AP) - More than a decade ago, 10-year-old Shyima Hall was brought to Southern California by an affluent Egyptian couple who forced her to sleep in a cold garage at night and spend her days working as a maid.\par \par \uc2 For nearly two years, Hall ironed clothes, washed dishes and handled other domestic chores until authorities freed her.\par \par \uc2 On Thursday, she met with officials again but this time to proudly take the oath of allegiance to America as a newly minted U.S. citizen -- a key step on her path to becoming a police officer or immigration agent to help other victims of human trafficking.\par \par \uc2 "Now I can move on with my career and start my life the way I want it," the 22-year-old said, her eyes sparkling after the ceremony on Thursday in Montebello. "It's just something I've waited for for a long time."\par \par \uc2 Hall was sent to work for an Egyptian couple as a domestic servant in Cairo when she was 9. The following year, Abdel Nasser Youssef Ibrahim and his then-wife Amal Ahmed Ewis-abd El Motelib arranged for someone to apply for a tourist visa on her behalf and brought her to the United States, U.S. court records show.\par \par \uc2 In 2000, Hall set foot in California -- but only inside the spacious home where Ibrahim and Motelib lived with their five children in Irvine. She was not allowed to play outside the house or with the other children, but rather slept in the garage without electricity and manually washed her clothes in a bucket, the documents show.\par \par \uc2 Both Ibrahim and Motelib slapped Hall and told her police would arrest her if they saw her outside the home, the documents show, adding they knew her visa had expired and did nothing to extend it.\par \par \uc2 For nearly two years, she lived in the garage, worked full time and was not allowed to attend school. A neighbor became suspicious and called police.\par \par \uc2 After her rescue, Hall wound up in foster care and bounced around from home to home. She was adopted by a family in Beaumont and was able to obtain legal status to remain in the country and eventually got her green card.\par \par \uc2 Hall -- who took her adoptive family's surname -- said she felt like the family was more enamored of her case than of her and weren't supportive of her efforts to start her career, which prompted her to move out and start a life of her own.\par \par \uc2 She took classes at college and got a job. She is now a sales supervisor at an upscale watch store and volunteers for her local police department in the hopes of becoming an officer. Now, with her naturalization certificate in hand, she can pursue her dream.\par \par \uc2 "No one really can tell you you can't do that or you can't be that person," she said after the naturalization ceremony for 900 new citizens. "I can be who I want to be and that's the most important part for me."\par \par \uc2 Hall said she doesn't dwell on the past and tries to look forward. She would also like to get her U.S. passport and visit Egypt to see her 10 brothers and sisters.\par \par \uc2 Mark Abend, a supervisory special agent at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said he met Hall when she was a frightened child rescued by police.\par \par \uc2 Over time, she began to confide in investigators about her experience, learned English, graduated from high school and has become an impassioned advocate for trafficking victims, speaking about her experience at training sessions held by law enforcement.\par \par \uc2 "For her to be able to go through all that and still keep her head up and not be suffering from severe depression... for her to actually pull it all together and become very successful is really amazing to me," said Abend, who attended the ceremony along with Hall's friends and attorneys.\par \par \uc2 In 2006, Ibrahim and Motelib pleaded guilty to holding Hall in involuntary servitude, forced labor, conspiracy and harboring an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . Ibrahim was sentenced to 36 months in prison and Motelib was sentenced to 22 months. Both were ordered to pay $76,000 to Hall for her work for the family.\par \par \uc2 The Associated Press reported on the case in a series in 2008 on the exploitation of children in Africa.\par \par \uc2 Moteilb was deported to Egypt in 2008. Ibrahim was determined to be subject to deportation, but an immigration judge ruled he could remain in the country.\par \par \uc2 Ibrahim is under an order of supervision and regularly reports to immigration authorities, said Virginia Kice, a spokeswoman for Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020111215e7cf001vb\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 LOS ANGELES (AP) - The Deep South drama "The Help" cleaned up with four nominations Wednesday for the Screen Actors Guild Awards, among them honors for Viola Davis, Jessica Chastain and Octavia Spencer.\par \par \uc2 The adaptation of the best-selling novel also was nominated for best ensemble cast, along with the silent film "The Artist," the wedding comedy "Bridesmaids," the family drama "The Descendants" and the romantic fantasy "Midnight in Paris."\par \par \uc2 The nominations are among the first major honors on the long road to the Feb. 26 Academy Awards. The SAG list of contenders and Golden Globe nominees that will be announced Thursday help sort out favorites from also-rans for Oscar voters, whose nominations come out Jan. 24.\par \par \uc2 Davis is up for best actress and Spencer for supporting actress as black maids who agree to share stories of their tough lives with an aspiring white writer at the start of the civil-rights movement in 1960s Mississippi. Chastain also was nominated for supporting actress as Spencer's lonely, needy new boss.\par \par \uc2 "The Artist" ran second with three nominations, including a best-actor honor for Jean Dujardin as a silent star falling from grace amid the advent of talking pictures and supporting actress for Berenice Bejo, who plays a rising sound-era movie star.\par \par \uc2 Along with Davis, best-actress contenders are Glenn Close as a woman disguising herself as a male butler in 19th-century Ireland in "Albert Nobbs"; Meryl Streep as British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in "The Iron Lady"; Tilda Swinton as a grief-stricken woman coping with her son's horrible deeds in "We Need to Talk About Kevin"; and Michelle Williams as Marilyn Monroe in "My Week With Marilyn."\par \par \uc2 Joining Dujardin in the best-actor category are Demian Bichir as a hard-working \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  father in "A Better Life"; George Clooney as a neglectful dad tending his two daughters in "The Descendants"; Leonardo DiCaprio as FBI boss J. Edgar Hoover in "J. Edgar"; and Brad Pitt as Oakland A's general manager Billy Beane in "Moneyball."\par \par \uc2 "Albert Nobbs" star Close was a double nominee, picking up a best-actress honor for a TV drama series for "Damages." Close's co-star Janet McTeer was nominated for supporting actress as a cross-dressing laborer in "Albert Nobbs."\par \par \uc2 Overlooked for best actor was Gary Oldman, whose performance in the espionage saga "Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy" has been billed by critics as one of the best in his career.\par \par \uc2 Also snubbed was Michael Fassbender for his daring role in the sex-addict drama "Shame" and Ryan Gosling for two acclaimed performances in the action tale "Drive" and the political drama "The Ides of March."\par \par \uc2 Several Oscar best-picture prospects will sit out the SAG ceremony, including Steven Spielberg's "War Horse" and Martin Scorsese's "Hugo," but those are epic tales whose impact comes more from their scope than their performances.\par \par \uc2 Another Oscar potential that missed out at SAG was David Fincher's "The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo," which features a blistering break-out performance by Rooney Mara.\par \par \uc2 "Bridesmaids" was a rare mainstream comedy that has earned critical respect. Along with its ensemble nomination, the film earned a supporting-actress slot for Melissa McCarthy as a crude but caring member of the wedding.\par \par \uc2 Missing out in the supporting-actress category was Clooney's young "Descendants" co-star Shailene Woodley, who delivers a breakout performance as a troublesome teen.\par \par \uc2 Up for supporting actor are Kenneth Branagh as Laurence Olivier in "My Week With Marilyn"; Armie Hammer as Hoover's FBI colleague and soul mate in "J. Edgar"; Jonah Hill as an economics whiz kid in "Moneyball"; Nick Nolte as a bad dad trying to make amends in "Warrior"; and Christopher Plummer as an elderly, ailing father who announces he's gay in "Beginners."\par \par \uc2 Betty White, the guild's lifetime-achievement award winner two years ago, had two TV nominations: comedy-series actress for "Hot in Cleveland" and "Hallmark Hall of Fame: The Lost Valentine."\par \par \uc2 "Modern Family" led the TV side with five nominations, including best comedy ensemble and individual honors for Julie Bowen, Ty Burrell, Eric Stonestreet and Sofia Vergara.\par \par \uc2 SAG also honors unsung action players with a stunt ensemble prize. The film stunt contenders are "The Adjustment Bureau," "Cowboys & Aliens," "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," "Transformers: Dark of the Moon" and "X-Men: First Class."\par \par \uc2 TV stunt nominees are "Dexter," "Game of Thrones," "Southland," "Spartacus: Gods of the Arena" and "True Blood."\par \par \uc2 The 18th annual SAG Awards will be presented Jan. 29.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Online:\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.sagawards.org"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.sagawards.org}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020111214e7ce001jk\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 EDINBURG, Texas (AP) - Dozens of law enforcement officers trudged through soggy brush near a South Texas middle school Tuesday looking for casings and other evidence to help explain how two boys were shot while they were trying out for the school basketball team.\par \par \uc2 Investigators have questioned three men who were found on adjacent ranchland after the shooting Monday evening. Two were practicing target shooting about a half mile from the school. A third was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  with an assault rifle who was trespassing on the property. The target shooters were released, but are still under investigation. The other man remained in custody. Investigators didn't know if any of them fired the shots.\par \par \uc2 School officials met with parents Tuesday morning, and both said they were surprised to learn there was hunting on private property just beyond the school's perimeter. Superintendent Rene Gutierrez said one property owner had informed officials about hunting on his land, but they hadn't known there was any in the area where the shots came from.\par \par \uc2 "We were not aware that there was hunting on the west side of the school or that there were (hunting) leases on the west side until last night," Gutierrez said.\par \par \uc2 With no Texas law prohibiting hunting on private land near a school and high-powered rifles that can fire more than a mile, school officials said the most immediate way to protect students might be building a cinder-block wall around two sides of Harwell Middle School to protect it from flying bullets.\par \par \uc2 The school opened just this year on rural property northeast of Edinburg, which is about 50 miles northwest of Brownsville. Homes line the road approaching the school, but ranchlands covered with thickets of short trees and undergrowth stretch out to the west and the north.\par \par \uc2 A chain link fence separates the back of the campus from about 200 yards of open field, and there a tree line starts an expanse of thick scrub to the west.\par \par \uc2 The boys, ages 13 and 14, were in a parking lot that had been converted into a temporary basketball court behind the school when they were shot about 4:45 p.m. Monday. About 50 children were trying out for the team. One boy going for a layup was shot just under the right arm, and the other was shot in the back while awaiting his turn.\par \par \uc2 Four coaches immediately rushed children inside the building while other staff tended to the wounded students, Gutierrez said. Both boys underwent surgery and were listed in stable condition, he said.\par \par \uc2 Investigators were able to retrieve a bullet from one of the boys. Hidalgo County Sheriff Lupe Trevino said they will check for a ballistics match with rifles taken from three men who were questioned. The target shooters told investigators they were practicing on property west of the school, and Trevino said they appeared to have been in the right line of fire to hit the students.\par \par \uc2 "We felt very certain that the shots came from afar," Trevino said. "They probably came from one of the surrounding ranches. We knew for sure that it did not occur from within the compound of the school."\par \par \uc2 Investigators were still trying to figure out where the third man was when the boys were shot. He had an AR-15 assault rifle, and Trevino said he could face trespassing and weapons charges in addition to his immigration violation.\par \par \uc2 Classes were held as scheduled Tuesday, but students were confined to campus buildings and extra security patrolled the campus.\par \par \uc2 Mike Cox, a spokesman for Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, said he was not aware of a specific law or regulation that prohibits hunting close to public buildings, such as schools or hospitals. He said it is against the law to discharge firearms within city limits or along any public road.\par \par \uc2 Trevino also said he didn't believe there was any law preventing hunting near a school.\par \par \uc2 "You're in the state of Texas and the state of Texas, like any other state in the union, has rural schools all over the country," Trevino said. "And a lot of the schools are surrounded by hunting ... Even during dove season, we get literally hundreds of calls of residents having barbecues having pellets rain upon their roof. I mean that happens every year. You've got to remember you're in rural Hidalgo County, Texas, and it is a hunting state."\par \par \uc2 However, he added, "you would seem to think also that there's some sort of personal responsibility that one has to take as a hunter or as a responsible adult."\par \par \uc2 A man who owns property northeast of the school had told school officials that he leased his property out to two deer hunters and that this would be the last year, Gutierrez said. That property owner advised the hunters of the school's location and told them to only shoot north, away from the campus, he said.\par \par \uc2 Esmeralda Gutierrez, who has a son in eighth grade, said school officials told her that students won't be allowed outside for activities this week. But they also said that since the adjacent land is private and the hunters have permission, there was nothing they could do.\par \par \uc2 Gutierrez said she remained concerned about the safety of her son and other students.\par \par \uc2 "I didn't know there was hunting there. It surprised me," Gutierrez said in Spanish. "It's dangerous for the kids."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writer Will Weissert in Austin contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020111213e7cd0015q\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) - The Supreme Court stepped into the fight Monday over a tough Arizona law that requires local police to help enforce federal immigration laws -- pushing the court deeper into hot, partisan issues of the 2012 election campaign.\par \par \uc2 The court's election-year docket now contains three politically charged disputes, including President Barack Obama's health care overhaul and Texas redistricting.\par \par \uc2 The debate over immigration already is shaping presidential politics, and now the court is undertaking a review of an Arizona law that has spawned a host of copycat state laws targeting illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 The court will review a federal appeals court ruling that blocked several provisions in the Arizona law. One of those requires that police, while enforcing other laws, question a person's immigration status if officers suspect he is in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 The case is the court's biggest foray into immigration law in decades, said Temple University law professor Peter Spiro, an expert in that area.\par \par \uc2 The Obama administration challenged the Arizona law by arguing that regulating immigration is the job of the federal government, not states. Similar laws in Alabama, South Carolina and Utah also are facing administration lawsuits. Private groups are suing over immigration measures adopted in Georgia and Indiana.\par \par \uc2 "This case is not just about Arizona. It's about every state grappling with the costs of illegal immigration," Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer, a Republican, said following the court's announcement Monday.\par \par \uc2 Fifty-nine Republicans in Congress, including presidential candidate Michele Bachmann, filed a brief with the court backing the Arizona law.\par \par \uc2 The immigration case, like the challenge to Obama's health care overhaul, pits Republican-led states against the Democratic administration in an argument about the reach of federal power. The redistricting case has a similarly partisan tinge to it, with Republicans who control the state government in Texas facing off against Democrats and minority groups that tend vote Democratic.\par \par \uc2 In the immigration arena, the states say that the federal government isn't doing enough to address a major problem and that border states are suffering disproportionately.\par \par \uc2 The issue has been widely discussed by the Republican candidates for president. They have mostly embraced a hard line to avoid accusations that they support any kind of "amnesty" for the some 12 million illegal immigrants estimated to be living in the U.S.\par \par \uc2 Newt Gingrich was most recently criticized by his opponents for saying he would grant legal status to some with longstanding family and community ties, and Gingrich has since endorsed the South Carolina law that allows police to demand a person's immigration status. That law is among the four state laws that have been challenged by the administration.\par \par \uc2 Brewer signed the Arizona immigration measure into law in April 2010. The administration sued three months later to block it from taking effect.\par \par \uc2 In April, a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco upheld a federal judge's ruling halting enforcement of several provisions of the law. Among the blocked provisions: requiring all immigrants to obtain or carry immigration registration papers; making it a state criminal offense for an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  to seek work or hold a job and allowing police to arrest suspected illegal immigrants without warrants.\par \par \uc2 In October, the federal appeals court in Atlanta blocked parts of the Alabama law that forced public schools to check the immigration status of students and allowed police to file criminal charges against people who were unable to prove their citizenship.\par \par \uc2 Lawsuits in South Carolina and Utah are not as far along.\par \par \uc2 The administration argued that the justices should have waited to see how other courts ruled on the challenges to other laws before getting involved. Still, following the court's announcement Monday, White House spokesman Jay Carney said, "We look forward to arguing our point of view in that case when the time comes."\par \par \uc2 Spiro, the Temple University immigration expert, said the court easily could have passed on the Arizona case for now. "They could have waited for the more extreme case to come from Alabama, which really outflanked the Arizona law," Spiro said.\par \par \uc2 He predicted the court would uphold the police check of immigration status but perhaps not the measure making it a crime to be without immigration documents.\par \par \uc2 Arguments probably will take place in late April, which would give the court roughly two months to decide the case\par \par \uc2 Justice Elena Kagan will not take part case, presumably because of her work on the issue when she served in the Justice Department in the Obama administration.\par \par \uc2 The case is Arizona v. U.S., 11-182.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020111212e7cc001bn\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) - Alabama's governor and the head of the state's child welfare agency say the state's tough new immigration law has not been used to take children away from their \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  parents despite the earlier predictions and fears of some immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Shortly after the law took effect, many illegal immigrants signed documents allowing friends, relatives and others to take care of their children if they were arrested or deported.\par \par \uc2 But Gov. Robert Bentley and Department of Human Resources director Nancy Buckner said this week that they know of no incidents where children have been taken because of the immigration law. Buckner and Bentley were asked about whether the law would be used to put children under state control following a press conference to discuss the success the state has had in finding families for foster children.\par \par \uc2 "It's not happening," Buckner said.\par \par \uc2 She said DHR was exempted from the provisions of the bill, passed by the Alabama Legislature earlier this year, and can't be used to help the state enforce the law.\par \par \uc2 Buckner said DHR is continuing its responsibility of taking care of children whose parents have been arrested or are unable or unfit to take care of their children.\par \par \uc2 But she said department records show no greater number of Hispanic children in DHR custody than before passage of the new law.\par \par \uc2 Alabama's law, regarded by many on both sides of the issue as the toughest in the U.S., was passed by the Republican-controlled legislature this year and signed by Bentley. A federal judge blocked some parts of the law, but allowed key provisions to stand -- including a provision that allows police to hold suspected illegal immigrants without bond. In those cases, Buckner said DHR will be called to take care of any children. But she said DHR officials are called in all such cases involving children and not just when the parents are immigrants.\par \par \uc2 The governor said he has not heard of any cases where the state had been asked to take custody of children because of the immigration law.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020111211e7cb001xl\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc27}{\*\bkmkend toc27}\b \uc2 NC lawmakers to discuss illegal immigration\b0\par\par\uc2 By GARY D. ROBERTSON   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 910 \uc2 words\par \uc2 11 December 2011\par 10:29\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2011.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) - North Carolina lawmakers are considering whether to delve further into the nation's immigration debate by making it more uncomfortable for illegal immigrants to live in the state. The federal government, the courts and legislative colleagues, however, could make strict rules like those approved in other states harder to enact in North Carolina.\par \par \uc2 After some incremental changes in recent years under Democratic rule, the new Republican majority at the Legislature this year debated several immigration-related bills, girding the hopes of anti-illegal immigration advocates. One significant law got on the books -- requiring local governments and employers with at least 25 workers to use a federal program to screen new hires for their immigration status.\par \par \uc2 Pending legislation can still be considered next May, and now a House committee looking at how the state should respond to illegal immigration is meeting to recommend more changes. The Pew Hispanic Center said North Carolina ranks ninth in population among the states with what it calls 325,000 unauthorized immigrants, defined as foreign-born non-U.S. citizens who aren't legal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 "Is it our role to be involved?" asked Rep. Sarah Stevens, R-Surry, a committee member, after the first meeting. "I think that's what this committee is looking at -- what can we do?"\par \par \uc2 Not much, argue opponents of laws they say hurt all immigrants, not just those that are living in the shadows for fear of deportation. They said immigration policy is the federal government's purview and additional restrictions in the name of public safety or taxpayer savings are misguided and single out Latinos.\par \par \uc2 Lawmakers also could have second thoughts about dramatic changes because the U.S. Justice Department has sued over wide-ranging immigration enforcement laws in Arizona, Alabama, Utah and South Carolina. Judges have blocked portions of them from being carried out. The U.S. Supreme Court could ultimately decide on their legality.\par \par \uc2 "I'm a bit surprised that North Carolina would want to go down that road," said Deborah Weissman, a professor at the University of North Carolina law school in Chapel Hill who studies immigration issues. "It does seem to have some indication that some individuals in the Legislature would prefer to rid the state of immigrants."\par \par \uc2 The first meeting of the House study committee last week attracted a tense, standing-room only crowd in a Legislative Building hearing room. Several dozen members of a Charlotte-based group opposed to state immigration laws sat or stood next to about 30 people from the group North Carolinians for Immigration Reform and Enforcement. They heard presentations from two sheriffs about participating in federal programs designed for deputies to process jailed criminal suspects who are determined to be in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 NCFIRE wants the Legislature to complete passage of bills that cleared one legislative chamber this year, including one that would no longer consider acceptable a photo identification card issued by the Mexican consulate as proof to receive government services and to determine identity.\par \par \uc2 "What we would like ultimately is Arizona-type or Alabama-type immigration laws enforced in North Carolina," NCFIRE President James Johnson said. A report from the Federation for American Immigration Reform estimated illegal immigration costs governments in the state more than $2 billion in expenditures annually. "We simply can't afford it anymore," Johnson said.\par \par \uc2 Alabama's immigration law allows police to check a person's immigration status during a traffic stop, makes it a felony for an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  to do business with the state and prevents courts from enforcing contracts involving illegal immigrants. Following complaints the law was tarnishing the state's image, Alabama's governor said Friday he would work with legislators on some changes.\par \par \uc2 A member of Jesus Ministry Inc., a faith-based group that bused supporters from Charlotte to Raleigh, mentioned at a rally that a 2006 study shows how the state's Hispanic residents contributed more than $9 billion a year to the state's economy.\par \par \uc2 Instead of embracing the Latino community, members say, the Legislature is trying to make them scapegoats for the state's ills ahead of a big campaign year.\par \par \uc2 "This is a political game that's being played every time that we have elections," said Jesus Ministry Executive Director Maudia Melendez, who immigrated to the U.S. from Nicaragua in the mid-1970s.\par \par \uc2 States have been assembling their own sets of immigration restrictions in response to the inability of Washington to rework what most consider a broken immigration system.\par \par \uc2 "There's enormous frustration that Congress isn't doing their job," said Ann Morse, director of the Immigrant Policy Project at the National Conference of State Legislatures. She said states probably would stay away from passing legislation like Arizona did until final courts rule on its legality. Resolution may not occur until 2013.\par \par \uc2 In North Carolina, the fact that the Senate didn't participate in the committee with the House shows Senate Republican leaders are less interested in the topic. Any bill also could face the veto pen of Democratic Gov. Beverly Perdue.\par \par \uc2 Looking at federal immigration issues will be a challenge, a committee member said.\par \par \uc2 "That's a perplexing question," said first-term Rep. John Faircloth, R-Guilford, a former High Point police chief. "To think we'd ever try to do anything to make our state less desirable for anyone is tough to deal with."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020111211e7cb001r0\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) - Alabama's governor said Friday he's working to clarify and simplify Alabama's tough immigration law, which critics say has damaged the state's international reputation and caused hardships for legal residents.\par \par \uc2 Republican Gov. Robert Bentley said he wants to eliminate unnecessary burdens on legal residents and businesses and protect faith-based services while ensuring that everyone working in Alabama is legal.\par \par \uc2 "We recognize that changes are needed to ensure that Alabama has not only the nation's most effective law, but one that is fair and just, promotes economic growth, preserves jobs for those in Alabama legally, and can be enforced effectively and without prejudice," the governor said in a statement.\par \par \uc2 Bentley didn't offer any specific changes being considered, but the law's opponents took his comments as an encouraging sign that they will go deeper than the "tweaks" he previously said were needed.\par \par \uc2 Aides to the governor and legislative leaders said details are being worked out. The governor's communications director, Rebekah Mason, said nothing will change regarding the employment of illegal immigrants, including requiring businesses to use the federal E-Verify system to check the legal status of new hires. "Anything beyond that is open for revision," she said.\par \par \uc2 The Legislature passed the law and Bentley signed it with the goal of scaring off illegal immigrants and opening up jobs for legal residents in a state suffering from nearly 10 percent unemployment. More than 30 groups and individuals challenged the law, but federal courts let several major provisions of the law take effect in late September.\par \par \uc2 Since then, two foreign workers for Alabama's prized Honda and Mercedes auto assembly plants have been stopped by police for not having the required documents to prove residency. The cases were later dropped.\par \par \uc2 But the incidents brought unwanted international attention to Alabama and prompted the Birmingham Business Alliance and others involved in industrial recruitment to call for changes to protect Alabama's image internationally.\par \par \uc2 Bentley said he and legislative leaders are addressing Alabama's image.\par \par \uc2 "We are reaching out internationally to reassure our global partners that the business climate in Alabama is as strong as ever, and our people and communities are as inviting and welcoming as we've always been," Bentley said.\par \par \uc2 Brian Hilson, president of the Birmingham Business Alliance, praised the officials for recognizing "the concerns of many, including the business community." He said the organization serving Alabama's largest metro area believes the law "taints the image and perception of Alabama" and places "uncertain and severe" penalties on businesses and individuals for violations.\par \par \uc2 One of the groups challenging Alabama's law in federal court said the governor's announcement represents a significant shift in the state's position, which had been that only "tweaks" would be made.\par \par \uc2 "It's encouraging that every state leader has now acknowledged that the law is incredibly flawed," said Richard Cohen, president of the Southern Poverty Law Center.\par \par \uc2 "The question now is how they'll move beyond rhetoric and truly restore the state's reputation. The devil will be in the details," he said.\par \par \uc2 United Steel Workers Vice President Fred Redmond said in a statement that the efforts by Bentley and Republican lawmakers to fix the law are "too little too late and not a viable solution." He said the law mirrors the fear and racism of the Jim Crow era.\par \par \uc2 "There is no question that our immigration system is broken," Redmond said in a statement. "But our answer as a nation cannot be to start criminalizing families. Alabama's solution has terrorized communities and separates families and we must stop it in its tracks."\par \par \uc2 When Bentley signed the immigration law, he called it the nation's toughest. His communications director said the goal now is to have the nation's most effective law. "Tough is open for debate," Mason said.\par \par \uc2 The law requires a check of legal residency when conducting everyday transactions such as obtaining a car license, enrolling a child in school, getting a job or renewing a business license.\par \par \uc2 Several parts of the law are on hold because of federal lawsuits, including a provision requiring schools to check the legal status of new students and making it a crime to transport an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Faith-based groups have been among the critics of the law, because they say it makes religious outreach and charity to immigrant communities illegal.\par \par \uc2 Bentley said he and the Republican leaders of the Legislature, House Speaker Mike Hubbard, and Senate President Pro Tem Del Marsh, have been meeting with many groups, including the business, education, agriculture, and faith communities. Bentley said it became clear from those meetings that changes are needed.\par \par \uc2 The House speaker said, "The Legislature isn't going to repeal or weaken the law, but there may be ways we can make it work better."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020111210e7ca0007n\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) - Alabama's governor said Friday he's working to clarify and simplify Alabama's tough immigration law, which critics say has damaged the state's international reputation and caused hardships for legal residents.\par \par \uc2 Republican Robert Bentley said they want to eliminate unnecessary burdens on legal residents and businesses and protect faith-based services while ensuring that everyone working in Alabama is legal.\par \par \uc2 "We recognize that changes are needed to ensure that Alabama has not only the nation's most effective law, but one that is fair and just, promotes economic growth, preserves jobs for those in Alabama legally, and can be enforced effectively and without prejudice," the governor said in a statement.\par \par \uc2 The governor didn't offer any specific changes they will consider, but the law's opponents took his comments as an encouraging sign that they will go deeper than the "tweaks" he previously said were needed.\par \par \uc2 Aides to the governor and legislative leaders said details are being worked out. The governor's communications director, Rebekah Mason, said nothing will change regarding the employment of illegal immigrants, including requiring businesses to use the federal E-Verify system to check the legal status of new hires. "Anything beyond that is open for revision," she said.\par \par \uc2 The Legislature passed the law and Bentley signed it with the goal of scaring off illegal immigrants and opening up jobs for legal residents in a state suffering from nearly 10 percent unemployment. More than 30 groups and individuals challenged the law, but federal courts let several major provisions of the law take effect in late September.\par \par \uc2 Since then, two foreign workers for Alabama's prized Honda and Mercedes auto assembly plants have been stopped by police for not having the required documents to prove residency. The cases were later dropped.\par \par \uc2 But the incidents brought unwanted international attention to Alabama and prompted the Birmingham Business Alliance and others involved in industrial recruitment to call for changes to protect Alabama's image internationally.\par \par \uc2 Bentley said he and legislative leaders are addressing Alabama's image.\par \par \uc2 "We are reaching out internationally to reassure our global partners that the business climate in Alabama is as strong as ever, and our people and communities are as inviting and welcoming as we've always been," Bentley said.\par \par \uc2 Brian Hilson, president of the Birmingham Business Alliance, praised the officials for recognizing "the concerns of many, including the business community". He said the organization serving Alabama's largest metro area believes the law "taints the image and perception of Alabama" and places "uncertain and severe" penalties on businesses and individuals for violations.\par \par \uc2 One of the groups challenging Alabama's law in federal court said the governor's announcement represented a significant shift in the state's position, which had been that only "tweaks" would be made.\par \par \uc2 "It's encouraging that every state leader has now acknowledged that the law is incredibly flawed," said Richard Cohen, president of the Southern Poverty Law Center.\par \par \uc2 "The question now is how they'll move beyond rhetoric and truly restore the state's reputation. The devil will be in the details," he said.\par \par \uc2 When Bentley signed the immigration law, he called it the nation's toughest. His communications director said the goal now is to have the nation's most effective law. "Tough is open for debate," Mason said.\par \par \uc2 The law requires a check of legal residency when conducting everyday transactions such as buying a car license, enrolling a child in school, getting a job or renewing a business license.\par \par \uc2 Several parts of the law are on hold because of federal lawsuits, including a provision requiring schools to check the legal status of new students and making it a crime to transport an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Faith-based groups have been among the critics of the law, because they say it makes religious outreach and charity to immigrant communities illegal.\par \par \uc2 The Republican governor said he and the Republican leaders of the Legislature, House Speaker Mike Hubbard, and Senate President Pro Tem Del Marsh, have been meeting with many groups, including the business, education, agriculture, and faith communities. Bentley said it became clear from those meetings that changes are needed.\par \par \uc2 The House speaker said, "The Legislature isn't going to repeal or weaken the law, but there may be ways we can make it work better."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020111209e7c9001xp\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) - Alabama Republicans who pushed through the nation's toughest law against illegal immigrants are having second thoughts amid a backlash from big business, fueled by the embarrassing traffic stops of two foreign employees tied to the state's prized Honda and Mercedes plants.\par \par \uc2 The Republican attorney general is calling for some of the strictest parts of it to be repealed.\par \par \uc2 Some Republican lawmakers say they now want to make changes in the law that was pushed quickly through the legislature.\par \par \uc2 Gov. Robert Bentley, who signed the law, said he's contacting foreign executives to tell them they and their companies are still welcome in Alabama.\par \par \uc2 "We are not anti-foreign companies. We are very pro-foreign companies," he said.\par \par \uc2 Luther Strange, the attorney general who's defending the law in court, this week recommended repealing sections that make it a crime for an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  to fail to carry registration documents and that require public schools to collect information on the immigration status of students. Both sections have been put on hold temporarily by a federal court.\par \par \uc2 Two foreign workers for Honda and Mercedes were recently stopped by police for failing to carry proof of legal residency. The cases were quickly dropped, but not without lots of international attention that Alabama officials didn't want.\par \par \uc2 One of the groups challenging the law in court said the auto workers' cases turned public opinion.\par \par \uc2 "Suddenly the reality of what the state has done hit people in the face," said Richard Cohen, president of the Southern Poverty Law Center.\par \par \uc2 Before 2011, Republicans tried repeatedly to pass an immigration law but were always stopped by the dominant Democrats. That changed when Alabama voters elected a Republican legislative super majority -- the first since Reconstruction. The result was a law described by critics and supporters as the toughest and most comprehensive in the nation.\par \par \uc2 It requires a check of legal residency when conducting everyday transactions such as buying a car license, enrolling a child in school, getting a job or renewing a business license. After the U.S. Justice Department and other groups challenged the law, the federal courts put some portions on hold, but major provisions took effect in late September.\par \par \uc2 Alabama suddenly found itself at the center of the nation's immigration debate, ahead of other states with tough laws, including Arizona, Georgia and South Carolina.\par \par \uc2 Within Alabama, much of the debate is within the business community that helped fund Republicans' new strength.\par \par \uc2 The Birmingham Business Alliance this week called for revisions in the law, expressing worry that it's tainting Alabama's image around the world. The group also said complying with the law is a burden for businesses and local governments, but did not offer specific changes.\par \par \uc2 James T. McManus\uc2 , chairman of the Alliance and CEO of one of the state's largest businesses, the \uc2 Energen Corp\uc2 ., said revisions "are needed to ensure that momentum remains strong in our competitive economic development efforts."\par \par \uc2 In Thomasville, a town of 4,700 about 80 miles southwest of Montgomery, Mayor Sheldon Day worries about recruiting industries.\par \par \uc2 He said about 25 foreign companies have visited the town to consider possible plant sites since Thomasville recruited a Canadian steel company in July 2010.\par \par \uc2 "Up until a few months ago, nobody raised the immigration issue," he said. But in the last few months, it's been brought up regularly. Day suspects competing states are portraying Alabama as hostile to foreigners even though he says that is not the truth. Based on the questions he gets from industrial prospects, he also believes competing states are recounting stories from Alabama's civil rights past.\par \par \uc2 "It's bringing back old images from 40 or 50 year ago," he said.\par \par \uc2 The governor says he's declined many national TV interviews about the law because he doesn't want to fuel comparisons with what he sees as Alabama's long gone past. "It's going to take us a long time to outlive those stereotypes that are out there among people that Alabama is living in the `50s and `60s," Bentley said.\par \par \uc2 The Republican sponsors of the immigration legislation promoted it as a jobs bill that would run off illegal immigrants and open up employment for legal residents. That was an easy political sale in a state suffering from nearly 10 percent unemployment. Even some Democrats voted for the law.\par \par \uc2 Since the law took effect, Alabama's unemployment rate has dropped a half percentage point. Economists and state officials who compile the statistics say it's too early to say whether to credit the immigration law.\par \par \uc2 But one of the sponsors, Republican Sen. Scott Beason of Gardendale, said neighboring states without a similar law haven't seen the same drop. "There is nothing else to attribute it to," he said.\par \par \uc2 If there has been any damage, he said it's the fault of inaccurate portrayals in the news media. He said the media ought to be reporting: "This law establishes a safer, more secure environment for people to come here and invest their money."\par \par \uc2 Republican House Speaker Mike Hubbard of Auburn said no industrial recruiters have complained to him about the law, and he will only support "tweaks" that make it more effective without weakening it.\par \par \uc2 Some Democratic Party leaders have called for repeal, but the party is now so weak in Alabama that the real debate is among Republicans.\par \par \uc2 The governor says the law is "very complicated" and needs to be simplified. He hasn't recommended any specifics, but he says Alabama won't abandon its goal of ensuring that only legal residents get jobs.\par \par \uc2 Strange, the attorney general, says his recommended changes "don't weaken the law, they just make it easier to defend."\par \par \uc2 Beason, however, said Strange's proposals would weaken the law by repealing two sections that allow private citizens to sue state and local officials to enforce it. Beason said that's needed because some officials are already saying they won't follow the law.\par \par \uc2 Other Republicans say the law is causing unnecessary problems for legal residents. Senate Republican Whip Gerald Dial of Lineville said legislators hear complaints from people about digging out documents to prove their legal residency when renewing professional licenses and buying car tags.\par \par \uc2 "I made some mistakes in voting for this bill, and I want to step up and fix them," he said.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020111208e7c8001x0\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

PAULSON   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 483 \uc2 words\par \uc2 8 December 2011\par 16:54\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2011.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 DENVER (AP) - Immigrant rights groups are enthusiastic about a plan by the Obama administration to review all of the pending 7,800 deportation cases in Colorado and 5,000 cases in Baltimore as part of an experiment to make enforcement agencies focus on high-priority cases.\par \par \uc2 About 300,000 cases pending nationwide could be affected if the experiment succeeds.\par \par \uc2 President-elect Laura Lichter of the American Immigration Lawyers Association said Thursday that cases now pending in Colorado will be put on hold while they are reviewed to ensure that only the worst offenders are being deported. She said prosecutors across the country have discretion on those cases, but current enforcement programs are not working.\par \par \uc2 Lichter said the current program, known as Secure Communities, has been embraced by some states including Colorado and resulted in the deportation of people accused of traffic violations or other misdemeanors. Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper is reviewing the state's participation in the program over questions of racial profiling and ensuring the rules are being followed.\par \par \uc2 Several states have said they don't want to participate, arguing that immigration is a federal, not state, responsibility.\par \par \uc2 "Over 60 percent of those being deported have no criminal records or misdemeanors," Lichter said.\par \par \uc2 The U.S. Department of Homeland Security disputes those figures, saying some analysts are focusing only on the technical reasons why an individual is deported and do not include the criminal history that triggered the decision to seek a removal order.\par \par \uc2 Immigration rights groups say that's proof stricter reviews are needed.\par \par \uc2 Even if illegal immigrants are allowed to stay, there is no guarantee they can get a job. Raul Cardenas, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who had his case put on hold last week under the current system, said he was crushed to learn that he can't go back to work.\par \par \uc2 "I still can't support my family. I feel useless," he said.\par \par \uc2 The six-week pilot project in Denver is part of a policy change announced in June by Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano. She had said the administration was putting those who pose a public safety or national security threat at the top of the queue.\par \par \uc2 Ira Mehlman, spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, said President Barack Obama is trying to bypass Congress by stopping enforcement of immigration laws in Colorado.\par \par \uc2 "The executive branch is just rewriting immigration law. They're making sure these cases never get to court," Mehlman said.\par \par \uc2 Republicans said making it a priority to deport those immigrants amounts to a back-door way of granting amnesty to other people who are living in the U.S. illegally but haven't committed crimes.\par \par \uc2 Congressional Republicans have said the government must first secure the border before discussions can turn to an overhaul.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020111208e7c8001ff\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) - Alabama's attorney general has become the highest ranking Republican official to suggest throwing out parts of his state's tough new immigration law, as he recommended that lawmakers repeal some portions of the statute that have been put on hold by federal courts and clarify some others.\par \par \uc2 In a letter to legislative leaders, Attorney General Luther Strange said the proposed changes would make the law easier to defend in court and "remove burdens on law-abiding citizens."\par \par \uc2 The private letter, acquired by The Associated Press, represents the first time the attorney general has expressed concerns since he started defending the law against a federal court challenge filed by about 30 organizations and individuals.\par \par \uc2 In reaction to his letter, legislative leaders disclosed they are working with business leaders on possible changes to keep Alabama business-friendly.\par \par \uc2 Todd Stacy , a spokesmen for House Speaker Mike Hubbard, R-Auburn, said, "Lawmakers are right now working with industry leaders to see what updates might be necessary to maintaining what is arguably the most business-friendly environment anywhere in America."\par \par \uc2 The law is considered by both opponents and supporters as the toughest in the U.S. against illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Strange recommended repealing a section that makes it a crime for an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  to fail to carry registration documents. That section has been put on hold temporarily by a federal court. Strange said it "adds little in terms of enforcement" because federal law already makes it a crime and repealing it would allow police "to focus on more important aspects of the law."\par \par \uc2 He also suggested repealing the requirement that public schools collect information on the immigration status of students. That section is also on hold.\par \par \uc2 His letter was written in response to requests from legislative leaders, including Senate President Pro Tem Del Marsh, R-Anniston, who had said the Legislature would only consider changes recommended by the attorney general.\par \par \uc2 Strange said his recommendations were based only on the legal challenge to the law and on efforts to make the law clearer, but did not address policy decisions by the Legislature. "The legislative leadership asked for our opinion and we provided it," he said in an e-mail.\par \par \uc2 He said the cost of gathering the school data and the diversion of resources to do that far outweigh the need to gather the data for use in litigation.\par \par \uc2 Strange also suggested repealing two portions of the law that allow citizens to sue public officials to compel them to enforce the new law. The state's chief law officer said those sections conflict with state constitutional provisions.\par \par \uc2 "Law enforcement and district attorneys throughout the state are concerned about being sued by citizens despite their best efforts to enforce the law," Strange said.\par \par \uc2 Strange recommended clarifying a prohibition against an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  entering into a business transaction with a state, city or county government agency. He said it has been confusing to some cities and counties, leading to long lines at some local government offices.\par \par \uc2 "Tightening up the definition of `business transaction' would help alleviate these issues," he said.\par \par \uc2 The Legislature passed the law to scare off illegal immigrants and open up jobs for legal residents in a state suffering from more than 9 percent unemployment. The law took effect in late September, except for provisions put on hold temporarily by federal courts.\par \par \uc2 Despite the jobs goal, a leading business organization in Alabama's largest urban area called for revisions Tuesday, saying it was concerned that the law taints Alabama's image around the world. The Birmingham Business Alliance said complying with the law is a burden for businesses and local governments.\par \par \uc2 "Revisions to our current law are needed to ensure that momentum remains strong in our competitive economic development efforts," said James T. McManus, chairman of the alliance and CEO of Energen Corp.\par \par \uc2 The group did not offer specific changes. The alliance voiced its opinion one day after Republican Gov. Robert Bentley said he is concerned the law might be affecting industrial recruitment. Bentley also said Monday the law needs simplifying, but it shouldn't be repealed.\par \par \uc2 An opponent of the law, Democratic Sen. Billy Beasley of Clayton, said revisions are not enough, and he will push ahead with legislation to repeal it in the legislative session starting Feb. 7.\par \par \uc2 "I don't feel that the senators who voted for it realized the fallout there would be and the effect of the law," he told reporters Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 Also Tuesday, state agriculture officials met with farmers in southwest Alabama to discuss their concerns that the law has driven off the laborers they will need to plant their crops in the spring. Officials discussed the possibility of using prison inmates to fill any farm labor shortages.\par \par \uc2 One of the attorneys challenging the law, Karen Tumlin of the Immigration Law Center, said officials are beginning to see the "devastating" impact the law is having on the state.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writers Bob Johnson in Montgomery and Jay Reeves in Birmingham contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020111206e7c6001ob\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

Harry Coates of Seminole filed the Oklahoma Guest Worker Program Act on Monday. Coates says the measure would stop immigrants from fleeing to Texas and other states and encourage them to return to Oklahoma and jobs that are chronically unfilled.\par \par \uc2 Coates says that since the passage of tough anti-\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  legislation in 2007, many illegal immigrants have moved to surrounding states where they pump millions of dollars into those economies.\par \par \uc2 Under the bill, people living in the country without legal permission could stay in Oklahoma if they purchase a guest worker permit for $2,000. They would have to find a sponsor to hire them and provide them with basic health insurance coverage.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020111206e7c6000dt\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc36}{\*\bkmkend toc36}\b \uc2 Hundreds of sex-crimes cases weren't properly examined by Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio's office\b0\par\par\uc2 By JACQUES BILLEAUD   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 1,441 \uc2 words\par \uc2 4 December 2011\par 14:57\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2011.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 EL MIRAGE, Ariz. (AP) - The 13-year-old girl opened the door of her home in this small city on the edge of Phoenix to encounter a man who said that his car had broken down and he needed to use the phone. Once inside, the man pummeled the teen from behind, knocking her unconscious and sexually assaulting her.\par \par \uc2 Seven months before, in an apartment two miles away, another 13-year-old girl was fondled in the middle of the night by her mother's live-in boyfriend. She woke up in her room at least twice a week to find him standing over her, claiming to be looking for her mother's cell phone.\par \par \uc2 Both cases were among more than 400 sex-crimes reported to Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio's office during a three-year period ending in 2007 -- including dozens of alleged child molestations -- that were inadequately investigated and in some instances were not worked at all, according to current and former police officers familiar with the cases.\par \par \uc2 In El Mirage alone, where Arpaio's office was providing contract police services, officials discovered at least 32 reported child molestations -- with victims as young as 2 years old -- where the sheriff's office failed to follow through, even though suspects were known in all but six cases.\par \par \uc2 Many of the victims, said a retired El Mirage police official who reviewed the files, were children of illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 The botched sex-crimes investigations have served as an embarrassment to a department whose sheriff is the self-described "America's Toughest Sheriff" and a national hero to conservatives on the immigration issue.\par \par \uc2 Arpaio's office refused several requests over a period of months to answer questions about the investigations and declined a public records request for an internal affairs report, citing potential disciplinary actions.\par \par \uc2 Brian Sands, a top sheriff's official who is in charge of the potential discipline of any responsible employees, was later made available to talk about the cases. He declined to say why they weren't investigated. "There are policy violations that have occurred here," Sands said. "It's obvious, but I can't comment on who or what."\par \par \uc2 Sands said officers had subsequently moved to clear up inadequately investigated sex-crimes in El Mirage and elsewhere in the county. He said leads were worked if they existed and cases were closed if there was no further evidence to pursue.\par \par \uc2 Arpaio's office was under contract to provide police services in El Mirage as the city struggled with its then dysfunctional department. After the contract ended and El Mirage was re-establishing its own police operation, the city spent a year sifting through layers of disturbingly incomplete casework.\par \par \uc2 El Mirage Detective Jerry Laird, who reviewed some the investigations, learned from a sheriff's summary of 50 to 75 cases files he picked up from Arpaio's office that an overwhelming majority of them hadn't been worked.\par \par \uc2 That meant there were no follow-up reports, no collection of additional forensic evidence and zero effort made after the initial report of the crime was taken.\par \par \uc2 "I think that at some point prior to the contract (for police services) running out, they put their feet on the desk, and that was that," Laird said.\par \par \uc2 Arpaio acknowledged his office had completed an internal probe into the inadequate investigations, but said, "I don't think it's right to get into it until we get to the bottom of this and see if there's disciplinary action against any employees."\par \par \uc2 A small number of cases from El Mirage were handed over to prosecutors, but the El Mirage Police Department said most were no longer viable -- evidence dating as far back as 2006 had grown cold or wasn't collected in the first place, victims had either moved away or otherwise moved on.\par \par \uc2 Bill Louis, then-assistant El Mirage police chief who reviewed the files after the sheriff's contract ended, believes the decision to ignore the cases was made deliberately by supervisors in Arpaio's office -- and not by individual investigators.\par \par \uc2 "I know the investigators. I just cannot believe they would wholesale discount these cases. No way," Louis said. "The direction had to come (from) up the food chain."\par \par \uc2 Louis said he believes whoever made the decision knew that illegal immigrants -- who are often transient and fear the police -- were unlikely to complain about the quality of investigations. He said some cases also involved families here legally.\par \par \uc2 El Mirage paid the sheriff's office $2.7 million for a wide range of police protection from 2005 through mid-October 2007, after the city's police department had been criticized in an audit as poorly organized, loosely supervised and mismanaged.\par \par \uc2 Although a small number of El Mirage officers continued working there during the period, Arpaio brought in patrol officers and detectives and managers who ran the department.\par \par \uc2 El Mirage police files obtained by The Associated Press through public records requests establish a pattern of sex-crimes not actually being investigated after the crimes were reported to Arpaio's office.\par \par \uc2 In April 2007, a 3-year-old girl was reported molested by her father, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who cared for the child while her mother was at work. When the mother confronted her husband about the abuse, he cried and swore he'd never do it again.\par \par \uc2 Yet a few days later, the mother noticed more signs of sexual abuse on her daughter and called for help. After the initial report, that help didn't come.\par \par \uc2 The string of unresolved cases left Elizabeth Ditlevson, deputy director for the Arizona Coalition Against Domestic Violence, shaking her head. "My impressions were anger at the system and concern for the people whose cases weren't addressed," she said.\par \par \uc2 According to both Sands and Scott Freeman, a sheriff's official who heard complaints from then-El Mirage Police Chief Mike Frazier about the quality of the sex-crimes investigations, more than 400 cases countywide had to be reopened. Freeman told outside investigators examining alleged managerial misconduct at Arpaio's office that a number of arrests were made in the reopened cases.\par \par \uc2 The April 2011 report on alleged managerial misconduct said the sheriff's internal effort to determine what had gone wrong with the sex-crimes investigations was twice derailed.\par \par \uc2 One delay occurred when the male sheriff's official leading the inquiry was accused of sexual harassment -- this by a female supervisor whose portfolio included some of the mishandled cases, according to the report.\par \par \uc2 Another internal affairs investigation, launched in May 2008, was stopped after the investigator was pulled away at the direction of David Hendershott, then the top aide to Arpaio, to help with another matter. The internal probe was reopened in December 2010 while Hendershott was on medical leave, according to the 2011 summary.\par \par \uc2 Hendershott's account conflicted with others.\par \par \uc2 Hendershott, who has since resigned amid separate misconduct allegations and declined a request by the AP to comment, told investigators the internal affairs inquiry was still in progress when he went on medical leave in 2010.\par \par \uc2 Still, Hendershott told investigators that the El Mirage Police Department had good reason to be upset about the sex-crimes handled by the sheriff's office.\par \par \uc2 The report of the 13-year-old who had been inappropriately touched by her mother's live-in boyfriend had been faxed to one of Arpaio's investigators. El Mirage police, who were given back the case about 11 months later, learned that it hadn't been worked.\par \par \uc2 When El Mirage police finally tracked down the mother, she said her boyfriend had moved out and that she no longer had contact with him. She and her daughter were in counseling and didn't want to bring the case to court.\par \par \uc2 In their follow-up on the case of the 13-year-old attacked by the man claiming to have a broken car, El Mirage police discovered Arpaio's office hadn't interviewed the victim.\par \par \uc2 An El Mirage detective went to the girl's home just off the city's main drag. The girl's uncle said she and her mother weren't around and took the investigator's card with a promise to ask them to call.\par \par \uc2 The mother never called back. She and her daughter's whereabouts are unknown.\par \par \uc2 The case of the molested 3-year-old was returned to El Mirage police unworked five months after the initial report. The family's beige tract home was deserted, the phone disconnected.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020111204e7c40041w\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) - After confusion and misgivings from some police about how to enforce Alabama's new immigration crackdown, the state is now requiring special training in the law for more than 16,000 law officers -- every sworn officer in the state.\par \par \uc2 Officials hope the unusual move will alleviate uncertainty about the law on the front lines of law enforcement.\par \par \uc2 Police chiefs, prosecutors and judges have said that the lengthy law's complicated provisions were hard to understand, and federal court rulings that blocked some sections while letting others take effect only made life tougher for officers on the street. Some departments have relied on little more than news reports for information about the law, officials say.\par \par \uc2 Alan Benefield, head of the Alabama Police Officers' Standards and Training Commission, said Thursday the panel decided last month to take the unusual step of requiring four hours of training for every sworn officer in the state because of the law's complexity and the lingering confusion. He said new laws or court rulings are sometimes added to the state's normal training curriculum, but full-blown courses for specific laws aren't held very often.\par \par \uc2 More than 1,000 officers already have finished the courses, he said, and thousands more officers from local, county and state agencies will go through training in coming weeks. Benefield said refresher sessions and curriculum updates will likely be required as courts issue new rulings on challenges by the Obama administration, immigrant rights groups and other opponents of the law.\par \par \uc2 The law has caused confusion in some areas.\par \par \uc2 On Nov. 16, in a case that made international news, a German manager with Mercedes-Benz was arrested under the law for not having a driver's license with him while driving a rental car. The Tuscaloosa city attorney said the charge was later dismissed after the man provided the documents in municipal court. State officials said the case was handled properly under the law.\par \par \uc2 But in an incident just this week, Honda Manufacturing of Alabama said a Japanese worker temporarily working in the country was cited under the immigration law. A person with knowledge of the case said the man was ticketed by a city officer at a routine roadblock even though he had a valid Japanese passport and an international driver's license.\par \par \uc2 Statehouse Republicans said descriptions of the incident didn't appear to match up with the law itself, which doesn't include a provision for ticketing someone. Also, the law states that police should accept a passport with valid stamps as proof that someone is in the country legally.\par \par \uc2 The president of the Alabama Circuit Judges Association says he's heard reports of police setting up roadblocks near mobile home communities where Hispanic people live and a municipal judge saying that anyone without a driver's license would be arrested under the law.\par \par \uc2 Signed by Republican Gov. Robert Bentley in June, the law is considered the nation's toughest state crackdown on illegal immigration both by supporters and opponents.\par \par \uc2 In lawsuits filed by the Justice Department and others, courts have blocked sections of the law, including a one-of-its-kind provision requiring public schools to check the citizenship status of students. But other sections began taking effect in late September, including one that requires police to detain people if they're discovered not to have valid documents during a routine encounter like a traffic stop.\par \par \uc2 Benefield, executive secretary of the commission, said the training focuses on sections of the law that police are most likely to be faced with enforcing, particularly the part that involves detaining people who lack proper identification.\par \par \uc2 "We tried to boil it down to the simple facts of what the officer on the street would be dealing with," said Benefield.\par \par \uc2 Training materials from the course, provided to The Associated Press by Benefield, emphasize that only the federal government has the power to determine whether someone is in the country legally, but that police agencies and administrators can be sued under the state law for failing to enforce either it or federal immigration statutes.\par \par \uc2 A course handout explains how officers should operate under the state statute -- profiling based on race, color or national origin is barred -- and says the law "does not authorize state, county and municipal agencies to seek out `illegals' for deportation."\par \par \uc2 Enforcement of the new law isn't supposed to interfere with other police work. "This law doesn't change the focus or priority of your agency," the materials state.\par \par \uc2 Commission officials trained about 75 officers at large departments and police academies, Benefield said, and those officers are training others at the local level. For example, 15 officers at the Montgomery Police Department went through the course and are training the rest of the agency's 550 officers, he said.\par \par \uc2 State judges will be trained on the law in January during a conference in Birmingham, said Scott Vowell, president of the state association for circuit judges.\par \par \uc2 "I am pleased to know about the police training. The more information the better," said Vowell, presiding circuit judge in Jefferson County, the state's most heavily populated area.\par \par \uc2 Benefield said the police training couldn't be held earlier because commission workers needed time to sort through the law and court rulings.\par \par \uc2 "We had to understand what we were training on before we could do it," he said. "There was a delay on it."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020111201e7c10006c\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

Gutierrez: Immigrants can fight back against tough new SC immigration law\b0\par\par\uc2 By BRUCE SMITH   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 709 \uc2 words\par \uc2 30 November 2011\par 18:07\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2011.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) - An Illinois congressman on Wednesday urged federal officials to drop deportation proceedings against a South Carolina worker, and said such appeals represent a way for illegal immigrants to deal with the tough new South Carolina immigration law set to take effect Jan 1.\par \par \uc2 "We're here to show the people in the immigrant community of South Carolina that you can fight back," said U.S. Rep. Luis Gutierrez, a Democrat who often speaks for the party on immigration issues.\par \par \uc2 Gutierrez appeared with Gabino Sanchez, a 27-year-old construction and landscaping worker from Ridgeland, S.C., during Sanchez' initial appearance at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in Charleston.\par \par \uc2 Sanchez was arrested on a traffic violation, found not to have a driver's license and to be an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  and reported to the federal agency. Gutierrez was there to argue that the deportation proceedings should be dropped under an agency policy that now provides for prosecutorial discretion in such cases.\par \par \uc2 Sanchez, who arrived in the U.S. from Mexico 13 years ago, has a wife and two children who are U.S. citizens. He had never before been arrested.\par \par \uc2 The government needs to use its limited resources deporting illegal immigrants who are a threat to society, not people like Sanchez, the congressman said.\par \par \uc2 "The (Obama) administration has said their highest priorities are criminals, drug dealers and people who rape and pillage and are a threat to our society," the congressman said before the closed hearing. "Obviously Gabino is not a threat."\par \par \uc2 Following the 75-minute hearing, the lawmaker said Sanchez had been given a March court date in Charlotte, N.C. But he said his office would immediately petition to have the deportation case dropped based on prosecutorial discretion.\par \par \uc2 "I have learned a lot," Gutierrez said, adding that while his office has helped others with deportation problems, Wednesday was the first time he had attended a hearing. "I arrived here. I asked for something and they said this is how you get it."\par \par \uc2 While he was at the hearing, a group of about three dozen protesters picketed outside the building, chanting in Spanish slogans such as "Obama listen. The people are in a struggle."\par \par \uc2 Gutierrez and U.S. Rep. Jan Schakowsky, also an Illinois Democrat, have been aggressively seeking cases of people with no criminal records facing deportation instead of waiting for a planned review of 300,000 cases in immigration courts.\par \par \uc2 On Jan. 1, South Carolina's new immigration law, considered among the toughest in the country, takes effect. It will require all law enforcement officers to call federal immigration officials if they suspect someone is in the country illegally. The call must follow an arrest or traffic stop for something else, and officers are barred from holding someone solely on their suspicion.\par \par \uc2 The federal government has gone to court to block the South Carolina law from taking effect.\par \par \uc2 Rob Godfrey, a spokesman for Gov. Nikki Haley, said the governor doesn't support Gutierrez.\par \par \uc2 "As the daughter of immigrants who came to this country legally, Governor Haley understands that no American value is more sacred than the rule of law. That's what this is about - nothing more, nothing less," Godfrey said. "These folks are not here legally -- our laws require that you be here legally."\par \par \uc2 Gutierrez expects a rash of new arrests when the South Carolina law takes effect. He said he was recently in Alabama, where a similar law requires police to detain people who can't prove they are in the country legally and prohibits illegal immigrants from receiving government services.\par \par \uc2 "What we are trying to establish a month before the (S.C.) law takes effect is that the immigrant community does have a way to defend itself," he said.\par \par \uc2 He said prosecutors must take into consideration in deportation proceedings such things as whether an immigrant arrived as a child, whether they have families and their ties to the community.\par \par \uc2 "The federal government is the only agency that can deport you," he added. "The state of South Carolina can't do it and the state of Alabama can't do it."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020111130e7bu0016j\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

Experts say it's a reaction to Latino Republicans' conservative views on immigration, and the scrutiny into their background is a new phenomenon that Latino Democrats rarely faced. New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez, a Republican and the nation's only Latina governor, recently found documents that suggested that her grandfather legally entered the country. Previous reports said her grandfather was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . Marco Rubio, Florida's GOP senator, also was accused of embellishing his family's immigrant story and later corrected his Senate website.

Now, thanks to the Eagle Ford shale play, the property tax rolls have jumped to $1.3 billion. "To think that you would use the b-word in conjunction with Karnes County is just crazy," Kroll said. "We're talking in billions and not millions." Property tax, sales tax and hotel-motel tax revenues are rising along with oil and gas production across the Eagle Ford shale formation, which sweeps from the Mexican border to East Texas. But along with the promise of once-in-a-generation oil riches comes overwhelming pressures on communities accustomed to a quiet, rural lifestyle.

And while the transition hasn't been necessarily easy, the three say life in America is a better life from the ones they led in the jungle. "We lived in the jungle, and everything is different in the U.S.," Reh said. "The houses and apartments are different, the beds and bedrooms, the food, the cars, the ... just everything." NHS teacher Inosencia McClendon said many of the Burmese students have adapted well, are making friends and are working to learn English.

The Bears (8-3) capped a perfect 4-0 month by finally getting a Big 12 win over Texas Tech, even with RG3 playing only a half. They also beat Oklahoma for the first time, and had their biggest fourth-quarter comeback ever. The 15 previous seasons, they won only four Big 12 games combined in November.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) - New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez is forced to research and clarify her late grandfather's immigration status. Marco Rubio, Florida's GOP Senator, is accused of embellishing his family's immigrant story. A Republican congressional candidate in California puts on his website that he is the great-grandson of an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 As more Latino Republicans seek and win elected office, their families' backgrounds are becoming subject to increased scrutiny from some Latino activists, a reaction experts say is a result of Latino Republicans' conservative views on immigration. It's a new phenomenon that experts say Latino Democrats rarely faced, and could be a recurring feature in elections as the Republican Party seeks to recruit more Latino candidates.\par \par \uc2 "It's a trend and we are seeing more of it," said Alfonso Aguilar, executive director of the Washington, D.C.-based Latino Partnership for Conservative Principles.\par \par \uc2 For years, most Latino elected officials were largely Democrats, except in Florida, where Cuban Americans tended to vote Republican. But recently, a new generation of Latino Republicans has won seats in Arizona, Texas, New Mexico, California and even Idaho. Those politicians have come under fire from some Latino activists for pushing for laws targeting illegal immigrants and for opposing efforts for comprehensive immigration reform -- views that are in line with most Republicans.\par \par \uc2 And the immigrant advocates are pointing to the GOP Latino elected leaders' own family histories in an effort to paint them as hypocrites. Ignacio Garcia, a history professor at Brigham Young University, said it comes from a long tradition by liberal activists of portraying Latino Republicans as "vendidos," or sellouts, since the majority of Latino voters tend to vote Democratic.\par \par \uc2 For example, Martinez tried twice in the New Mexico state legislature to overturn a state law that allows illegal immigrants to obtain state drivers' licenses. Then earlier this year, various media outlets reported that a grandfather of Martinez may have been an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . The reports sparked immigrant advocates to protests outside the state Capitol with poster-size photos of Martinez on drivers' licenses.\par \par \uc2 Martinez, a Republican and the nation's only Latina governor, ordered her political organization to research her family's background and found documents that suggested that her grandfather legally entered the country and had various work permits.\par \par \uc2 The episode drew criticism, even from those who opposed Martinez' efforts on state driver's licenses. "This has nothing to do with her views and how she governs," said Michael A. Olivas, an immigration law professor at the University of Houston who also is aiding in a lawsuit against a Martinez's administration probe over the license fight. "I don't think it's fair for people to dig around in her family's past."\par \par \uc2 In Florida, Rubio's official Senate website until recently described his parents as having fled Cuba following Fidel Castro's takeover. But media organizations reported last month that Rubio's parents and his maternal grandfather emigrated for economic reasons more than two years before the Cuban Revolution.\par \par \uc2 Somos Republicans, a group dedicated to increasing Latino Republican voting numbers, immediately attacked Rubio over the discrepancy and for holding harsh views on immigration. "We believe it is time to find out the complete history of his parents' immigration history," the group said in a statement. "It is also time for Rubio to be a leader and help Senator Bob Menendez (D-NJ) fix the broken immigration system."\par \par \uc2 Patricia Montes, executive director of Centro Presente, an immigrant advocacy group in Somerville, Mass., said voters need to know a politician's family background for clues on how they will respond to people with similar stories. "It's very important to voters," said Montes.\par \par \uc2 Montes said most Latino and immigrant voters don't simply view Latino Republicans as "vendidos" but rather as politican leaders who don't share their views. "I don't care if someone is Latina or not," said Montes. "I care if they believe in the same things I do, and if their policies will affect the immigrant community."\par \par \uc2 Garcia said the current tension also is a result of a new breed of Latino Republicans finally winning high profile seats after years of being largely ignored or dismissed. Garcia said there have always been Hispanic Republicans, through their numbers have been typically small and they have often faced heat from the largely Democratic Latino population.\par \par \uc2 In New Mexico, for example, the colorful lawman and lawyer Elfego Baca helped establish the Republican Party just after New Mexico became a state in 1912 and actively tried recruit the state's mutigenerational Latino population to join the party. Baca won a number of local offices, including district attorney, but lost bids for Congress and various statewide offices.\par \par \uc2 In Texas, civil rights activist Felix Tijerina, a Mexican-American Houston restaurateur and former national president of the League of United Latin American Citizens in the 1950s, remained committed to Republican Party despite a backlash from fellow activists who disagreed with his laissez faire, pro-business views. One Texas civil rights leader, John J. Herrera, called Tijerina "a white man's Mexican" for his support of Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower for president over Democrat Adlai Stevenson.\par \par \uc2 "The difference now is that these new Latino Republicans, like Martinez and Rubio, are better prepared and are being groomed as national figures," said Garcia. "Meanwhile, the Democrats are falling behind. They have no equivalent and they aren't giving Latinos the same opportunity."\par \par \uc2 Garcia said there's also a new factor -- the millions of new independent Latino evangelicals who could be potential GOP voters. This population is new and unpredictable, he said.\par \par \uc2 Still, some Latino Republicans want to use the new attention around them in the party to change what they say is damaging rhetoric around immigration. Tony Carlos, who is seeking the GOP nomination for California's 3rd Congressional District, is running on a platform to push comprehensive immigration reform and believes if other Republicans follow, more Latinos will vote with the GOP.\par \par \uc2 On his campaign website Carlos says his great-grandfather came to Arizona from Mexico "without papers." Carlos said it's all about showing that his family is part of an ongoing American story and that political leaders need to honestly attack today's problems.\par \par \uc2 "I'm putting my family history out there. And once Latino voters hear that I support immigration reform, I find that they are open to other issues that appeal to conservatives," said Carlos. "My argument is that they are just as conservative. They are just in the wrong party."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020111127e7br003dt\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

But even as world leaders abandon Assad, the regime has refused to ease a military assault on dissent that already has killed more than 3,500 people.

For Gingrich, the former House speaker, the backing builds on his recent rise in the polls and quick work to build a campaign after a disastrous start in the summer.

It's a new phenomenon that experts say Latino Democrats rarely faced, and could be a recurring feature in elections as the Republican Party seeks to recruit more Latino candidates.\par \par \uc2 New Mass translation launches in American parishes\par \par \uc2 CLAYTON, N.C. (AP) -- English-speaking Roman Catholics who have regularly attended Mass for years found themselves in an unfamiliar position Sunday, needing printed cards or sheets of paper to follow along with a ritual many have known since childhood. "I don't think I said it the right way once," said Matthew Hoover, who attends St. Ann Catholic Church in Clayton, a growing town on the edge of the Raleigh suburbs.

(AP) -- Jesse Yeh uses the University of California-Berkeley library instead of buying textbooks. He scrounges for free food at campus events and occasionally skips meals. He's stopped exercising and sleeps five to six hours per night so he can take 21 credits -- a course load so heavy he had to get special permission from a dean. The only thing he won't do: take out a student loan.\par \par \uc2 Illinois fires Zook after 0-6 collapse\par \par \uc2 CHAMPAIGN, Ill.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) - A federal judge in Montgomery has stopped state officials from using Alabama's tough new immigration law to prevent immigrants from renewing required permits on manufactured homes.\par \par \uc2 U.S. District Judge Myron Thompson issued a temporary restraining order Wednesday evening that allows Alabama residents to renew registration of manufactured homes without requiring that they prove that they are in the country legally. The deadline for renewing the registration without being fined is Nov. 30.\par \par \uc2 Attorneys for a coalition of civil rights groups said earlier that by refusing to renew the permits, state officials could force people to abandon their homes.\par \par \uc2 Thompson granted the order because he said plaintiffs had "a substantial" likelihood of proving their case. He also said in his order that state officials had not set up a proper way for manufactured home owners to prove they are legal U.S. residents.\par \par \uc2 Thompson ordered Alabama Revenue Commissioner Julie Magee to inform officials in all 67 Alabama counties that they are not to withhold the permits from immigrants. He made the ruling several hours after holding a hearing in which a coalition of civil rights attorneys argued withholding the permits was part of a plan to run immigrants out of the state.\par \par \uc2 The law has been described by critics and supporters as the toughest crackdown on illegal immigrants in the country.\par \par \uc2 In his ruling Thompson said validating legal immigration status is a federal function and state officials have taken no steps to use one of several federal programs to determine the status of manufactured home recipients.\par \par \uc2 The House and Senate sponsors of the immigration bill, approved by the Legislature earlier this year, both testified Wednesday a purpose of their legislation was to encourage illegal immigrants to leave the state.\par \par \uc2 "My purpose was to make it difficult for illegal immigrants to live and work in Alabama," said the House sponsor, Republican Rep. Micky Hammon of Decatur. The wide ranging law effects many daily facets of life for immigrants, including allowing police to detain people they suspect of being an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  and making it illegal to employ illegal aliens.\par \par \uc2 The Senate sponsor, Sen. Scott Beason, a Republican from Gardendale, said he believes illegal immigrants take the jobs that should go to "legal Alabama taxpayers." He also said he believes they bring diseases such as tuberculosis into the U.S.\par \par \uc2 Mary Bauer, attorney for the Southern Poverty Law Center, asked Beason if the purpose of the law "is to force people to leave."\par \par \uc2 "The purpose is reduce the number of illegal aliens in this state," Beason said.\par \par \uc2 Hammon and Beason testified Wednesday during a federal court hearing in Montgomery. Two Elmore County immigrants are challenging a section of the law that prohibits most contracts where one party is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . Civil rights groups criticize the law on several points, including that it forces immigrants to leave Alabama.\par \par \uc2 Magee, the Alabama revenue commissioner, testified that the new law requires county employees to check the immigration status on anyone who does business with the state. She said state officials have provided counties with a list of documents, including a driver's license, acceptable to prove citizenship.\par \par \uc2 But Karen Tumlin, attorney for the National Immigration Law Center, told Thompson the bill specifies that immigration status must be confirmed by federal authorities. She argued the state doesn't have a system in place to determine if people renewing manufactured home permits are legal or not.\par \par \uc2 Assistant Attorney General Jim Davis argued that attorneys for the plaintiffs did not prove that the new law violates the rights of immigrant manufactured home owners.\par \par \uc2 A Senate co-sponsor of the bill, Clay Scofield of Guntersville, testified he believes illegal immigrants have brought organized criminal activity into the northeast section of Alabama he represents. He said that activity includes prostitution and storing illegal weapons.\par \par \uc2 He said that was part of what motivated him to help pass the new law.\par \par \uc2 "I wanted to take away any incentive for illegal immigrants to be here," Scofied said.\par \par \uc2 5\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020111124e7bo0002e\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) - A new federal lawsuit was filed Friday challenging a section of Alabama's immigration law that civil rights groups say makes it impossible for those who can't prove U.S. citizenship or lawful immigration status to legally keep their manufactured homes\par \par \uc2 The lawsuit was filed Friday in federal court in Montgomery by two immigrants in Elmore County named in the lawsuit only as "John Doe No. 1" and "John Doe No. 2." They are challenging a section of the law that prohibits most contracts where one party is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Attorneys for the plaintiffs say that provision is being used by state revenue officials to keep illegal immigrants from paying an annual registration fee and obtaining a decal that by law must be displayed on manufactured homes. State law requires the registration to be renewed by Nov. 30.\par \par \uc2 One of the attorneys for the plaintiffs, Mary Bauer, legal director of the Southern Poverty Law Center, said that without the permit some people may be forced to abandon their homes and left homeless.\par \par \uc2 "It's a flagrant violation of the Fair Housing Act and the United States Constitution," Bauer said.\par \par \uc2 The plaintiffs asked U.S. District Judge Myron Thompson to issue a temporary restraining order stopping state officials from preventing illegal immigrants from renewing their manufactured home permits.\par \par \uc2 A hearing on the request was held Friday evening in Thompson's chambers. Thompson did not issue an immediate ruling.\par \par \uc2 The hearing was not open to the public. State Revenue Commissioner Julie Magee, who is named as a defendant in the lawsuit, could not be reached for comment Friday evening.\par \par \uc2 This is one of several lawsuits that have been filed seeking to stop all or parts of the immigration law, which has been described by supporters and critics as the toughest in the country.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020111119e7bj00055\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) - Alabama's unemployment rate has dropped one-half percentage point to 9.3 percent, which is the fourth consecutive month of improvement, according to statistics released Friday.\par \par \uc2 "I'm about ready to call it a trend," said Alabama's industrial relations director, Tom Surtees.\par \par \uc2 Alabama's October rate of 9.3 percent was down from 9.8 percent in September and is Alabama's lowest since 9.3 percent was recorded in April, Surtees said.\par \par \uc2 "While we are still a long way from reaching full employment, October's decline shows positive momentum for our state as we continue to put Alabamians back to work," Gov. Robert Bentley said.\par \par \uc2 October was the first full month for major portions of Alabama's tough immigration law to be in effect. The Legislature passed the law to open up jobs for legal residents, but Surtees said there is nothing in the statistics to indicate whether the law is having an impact.\par \par \uc2 That's because Alabama's drop mirrored a national decline from 9.1 percent in September to 9.0 in October. Every Alabama county recorded a lower unemployment rate in October. Three of Alabama's neighbors -- Georgia, Tennessee and Florida -- had lower unemployment rates. And the seasonally adjusted unemployment figures don't include farm jobs, which some laborers abandoned when the immigration law went into effect in late September.\par \par \uc2 A sponsor of the immigration law, Republican Rep. Micky Hammon of Decatur, insisted it must be having an impact because some counties with large Hispanic populations saw significant reductions in unemployment.\par \par \uc2 "Despite how desperately \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  sympathizers have tried to portray this law as somehow harmful to our state's economy, the truth is more Alabamians are working today thanks in part to our decision to crack down on illegal immigration," he said.\par \par \uc2 Surtees said there are several positive trends in Alabama's economy. For instance, Alabama had 23,408 initial claims for unemployment in October, which was lower than the same month for the past three years. The unemployment benefits paid in October totaled $26 million, which was also less than any October in the last three years. October was the first month since April 2005 that every Alabama county showed a decline in unemployment.\par \par \uc2 Alabama's unemployment rate represents 201,296 people looking for work, which is nearly 10,000 fewer than the previous month.\par \par \uc2 Alabama's job gains came primarily in the trade, transportation and utilities sector, the government sector, and the professional and business services sector.\par \par \uc2 Ahmad Ijaz, an economic researcher at the University of Alabama's Center for Business and Economic Research, said the October numbers indicate some unemployed Alabamians gave up on looking for jobs because the state's civilian labor force declined, and the unemployed are no longer counted in the statistics if they stop looking for work. But he said that overall, the trends are positive.\par \par \uc2 "We've turned the corner. We are not growing the pace we should, but other states aren't either," he said.\par \par \uc2 He predicts slow improvement in the months ahead because consumers are still cautious about the economy.\par \par \uc2 Alabama counties with the lowest rates are Shelby at 6.1 percent, Coffee at 6.8 percent and Lee at 7.1 percent. Counties with the highest rates are Wilcox at 19.0 percent and Dallas and Bullock at 16.6 percent. State officials took particular notice of Wilcox County falling below 20 percent because the rural county had been above the mark for more than two years.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020111118e7bi00266\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 FRAMINGHAM, Mass. (AP) - Police did not have the right to stop a car being driven by President Barack Obama's uncle before his drunken-driving arrest, his lawyer said in court Thursday.\par \par \uc2 Attorney P. Scott Bratton said during a brief appearance in Framingham District Court that he plans next month to file a motion to suppress the traffic stop that led Onyango Obama's arrest in August.\par \par \uc2 "He wasn't committing any motor vehicle violations at the time. That's our position," Bratton said.\par \par \uc2 Obama, the 67-year-old half brother of the president's late father, has pleaded not guilty to charges of operating under the influence of alcohol, negligent operation of a motor vehicle and failure to yield the right of way.\par \par \uc2 Obama did not speak in court Thursday. A hearing on his lawyer's suppression request is scheduled for Jan. 12.\par \par \uc2 Obama was arrested in Framingham, about 20 miles west of Boston, after police said he rolled through a stop sign and nearly caused a cruiser to strike his SUV. Police said Obama, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , failed several sobriety tests and blew a reading of 0.14 percent on a blood-alcohol breath test, above the state's legal driving limit of 0.08 percent.\par \par \uc2 After being booked at the police station, police said Obama was asked whether he wanted to make a telephone call to arrange for bail.\par \par \uc2 "I think I will call the White House," he stated, according to a police report.\par \par \uc2 Obama initially was held without bail on a detainer from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials on allegations he violated an order to return to Kenya 20 years ago. He was subsequently released and ordered to regularly check in with immigration officials.\par \par \uc2 In the book "Dreams from My Father," the president writes about retracing his roots and his 1988 trip to Kenya. In that section, he refers to an Uncle Omar, who matches Obama's background and has the same date of birth.\par \par \uc2 The White House has said it expects the arrest of Onyango Obama to be handled like any other case.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020111117e7bh001xa\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) - Police arrested 13 protesters in Alabama's capital Tuesday as they demonstrated against the state's strict new law clamping down on illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 About 100 people, most of them Hispanic and college-aged, chanted slogans as they marched in light rain around the state Capitol and to the adjacent Statehouse where the legislature works.\par \par \uc2 "Undocumented, unafraid," "No papers, no fear, immigrants are marching here," and "Ain't no power like the power of the people," were among the slogans the protestors chanted as they marched. Later, some were hauled off to jail in a yellow bus normally used by the city parks and recreation department.\par \par \uc2 Some sat down on Union Street between the Statehouse and the Capitol when police approached and warned them in English and Spanish that they would be arrested if they didn't move.\par \par \uc2 None did and police arrested 11 demonstrators, tying their hand with yellow straps and loading them into the bus.\par \par \uc2 Federal courts have blocked parts of the Republican-backed law from taking effect, but both supporters and critics still call it the nation's toughest state law against illegal immigration. The Obama administration opposes the law, which is calls an overreach by the state.\par \par \uc2 One of those arrested was 19-year-old Catalina Rios, a student at Henry Ford Community College in Detroit. She identified herself an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Mexico.\par \par \uc2 Looking like a typical American teenager with her long dark hair in a ponytail, Rios said she knew there was a possibility she might be deported as she sat in the street waiting to be arrested.\par \par \uc2 "I know that I live in fear every single day of that, so this is no different," Rios said. "I'm doing this for all the immigrant students who struggle every day."\par \par \uc2 A Montgomery attorney who volunteered to represent those arrested, Mike Winter, said he understood they were mostly being charged with disturbing the peace, but also could be held for immigration officials.\par \par \uc2 After walking all the way around the Capitol one time, about 20 protesters entered the Statehouse and went up to the seventh-floor office of state Sen. Scott Beason, R-Gardendale, a key proponent of the law.\par \par \uc2 Once downstairs, two of the demonstrators -- college students Ernesto Zumaya, 24, of Los Angeles and Caesar Marroquin, 21, of Philadelphia -- linked arms and sat down on the floor of the main lobby. They vowed not to leave until Beason responded to their concerns. Beason did not respond to the protest and Zumaya and Marroquin were arrested peacefully when the building closed for the day.\par \par \uc2 Both said they are immigrants from Mexico without papers who have lived in the U.S. most of their lives. Marroquin said he always wanted to be a U.S. Marine.\par \par \uc2 Beason said later that he was not in his office Tuesday afternoon and did not immediately get the message except being told there were people at the Statehouse to see him.\par \par \uc2 Beason defended the law when asked about the protest.\par \par \uc2 "My intention is to enforce what's already in place in federal law," Beason said. "I make no apologies. I'm trying to do what I feel is best for the people of Alabama."\par \par \uc2 A leader of the protest, Mohammad Abdollahi, who said he was an immigrant without papers from Iran who lives in Bessemer, explained that the purpose of the demonstration was for their voice "to be heard."\par \par \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020111116e7bg0008k\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

Susana Martinez researches grandparents' immigrant past\b0\par\par\uc2 By BARRY MASSEY and RUSSELL CONTRERAS   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 995 \uc2 words\par \uc2 14 November 2011\par 15:25\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2011.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) - New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez has dug into her family's ancestry and uncovered immigration documents that she says suggest her paternal grandparents followed common practices in coming to the United States from Mexico in the early 1900s, contradicting earlier indications they were illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Martinez, a Republican and the nation's only female Hispanic governor, made headlines this year by acknowledging that her grandparents came to the U.S. without immigration documents. But she said her comments were based on what she has since learned were mischaracterizations of census information by the news media.\par \par \uc2 The governor directed her political organization to undertake the genealogical research after publicity about her immigrant roots and her push to repeal a law allowing illegal immigrants to get a driver's license.\par \par \uc2 "We don't know everything, I'm sure," the governor said in an interview with The Associated Press. "But it gave us more information than we had and it helped us understand ... the family tree and how people came back and forth from Mexico into the United States."\par \par \uc2 The governor's opponents have pointed to her immigrant grandparents as an example of why New Mexico should welcome illegal immigrants and continue to allow them to get a driver's license. Only New Mexico, Washington and Utah grant driver's licenses or permits to immigrants illegally living in the U.S.\par \par \uc2 Martinez has unsuccessfully asked the Legislature to repeal a 2003 law allowing illegal immigrants to obtain driver's license.\par \par \uc2 The 1930 U.S. census has been cited in published reports as indicating the governor's grandparents were illegal immigrants. However, the census only records they were not U.S. citizens at the time they were living in El Paso. The census used a code, "AL" to designate they were "aliens," meaning they were not citizens and had not filed papers declaring their intent to become citizens. It does not indicate their immigration status or whether they were living in the United States legally, according to historians and immigration experts.\par \par \uc2 Michael A. Olivas, an immigration law expert and director of the Institute of Higher Education Law & Governance at the University of Houston, said the documents are "not clear" in indicating that her grandfather was ever an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  by today's definition or maintained legal status throughout his time in the U.S.\par \par \uc2 "There was no such thing as an undocumented immigrant during that time" in the American Southwest, said Olivas, a Santa Fe resident. "There was no secure Mexican border and people came and went with no problem."\par \par \uc2 The research provided Martinez insight into a Mexican-born grandfather, whom she never knew while growing up in El Paso, Texas, along the U.S.-Mexico border. She said researchers' findings also corroborated her brother's statements during last year's campaign that she is the great-granddaughter of prominent Mexican revolutionary general Toribio Ortega.\par \par \uc2 On Monday, she visited Cuchillo Parado, Mexico, for a celebration recognizing the father of her father's mother as a revolutionary general who led a band of supporters credited as being the first to take up arms on Nov. 14, 1910 against a decades-long dictator. Martinez said her family's roots in Mexico -- regardless of questions surrounding her grandparents immigration status -- "really doesn't change my policy at all."\par \par \uc2 "It's not like I started talking about driver's licenses and then all of a sudden realized, `Oh my gosh I came from Mexico and that's a conflict.' I've known where my heritage is from all along," said Martinez.\par \par \uc2 The census lists 1910 as the year her grandfather, Adolfo Martinez, immigrated to the U.S. He worked as a taxi driver and spoke English. Her grandmother, Francisca Martinez, came to the U.S. in 1915, according to the same census document.\par \par \uc2 Her grandparents had U.S. government permits to cross the border on several occasions, according to documents provided to the AP by the governor's political committee. They were dated from 1908 through 1931, and several were issued by the U.S. Department of Labor's immigration service.\par \par \uc2 "So he understood the process and seemed to have followed the process," the governor said of her grandfather.\par \par \uc2 Olivas said the documents show the governor's grandfather traveled freely back and forth from Mexico and the U.S., like many Mexican citizens during the turn of the century.\par \par \uc2 Guadalupe San Miguel, Jr., a history professor at the University of Houston and a noted scholar of Mexican-American history, said it wasn't until a 1924 federal law outlined rules for immigrants with proper documents.\par \par \uc2 "But they did not apply the law to people from the Western Hemisphere," said San Miguel. "It only applied to people from Europe, Africa and Asia, for example."\par \par \uc2 San Miguel said the "concept of undocumented" first emerged in popular literature and among politicians during the Great Depression after lawmakers began complaining about the economy and blaming the growing Mexican-American and Mexican immigrant population for taking jobs.\par \par \uc2 Researchers for the governor found that Martinez's grandfather received a Social Security number in 1962 in Texas.\par \par \uc2 Until researchers assembled their information, the governor said, she had never seen the census or other immigration documents.

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc59}{\*\bkmkend toc59}\b \uc2 SPIN METER: Candidate Perry bashes gov't spending, but asks Washington for more for Texas\b0\par\par\uc2 By WILL WEISSERT   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 935 \uc2 words\par \uc2 14 November 2011\par 09:44\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2011.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 AUSTIN, Texas (AP) - Rick Perry, who bashes federal spending everywhere he goes on the presidential campaign trail, has spent 11 years as Texas' governor asking Washington for money.\par \par \uc2 Perry sought and received $24.2 billion in stimulus funding for Texas while saying the program was bad federal policy. He helped secure more than $100 million to protect against drug violence and illegal immigration on the Mexican border. The governor also endorsed his state's request for money under President Barack Obama's new health care law, though he now promises to help repeal the measure should he win the White House.\par \par \uc2 Most of all, Perry asked for emergency federal aid for victims of wildfires, tornadoes, hurricanes, droughts, flooding and crop-killing heat waves and freezes in his state's 254 counties. Texans hit by natural disasters "deserve a more immediate, compassionate response from their federal government," Perry wrote in a November 2009 letter complaining that the Housing and Urban Development Department was slow in aiding hurricane victims.\par \par \uc2 That's a far cry from today's Perry, who has promised to make the federal government as inconsequential in peoples' lives as possible.\par \par \uc2 "I'm going to show up in Washington, D.C., with a sledgehammer, and they're not going to like it," he said during a recent campaign swing in Iowa.\par \par \uc2 Perry made 1,180 requests for federal aid since 2001, according to an Associated Press analysis of documents obtained through a state Open Records Act request. That means the governor sent letters seeking money from Washington at a rate of about one every four days.\par \par \uc2 Perry isn't the only conservative official who campaigns against federal spending while trying to get as much of it as possible. In a letter to the White House in February 2009 requesting stimulus funds, he explained his reasoning. "Through the years, Texas taxpayers have sent substantially more dollars to Washington than we receive on issues ranging from transportation to border security and hurricane relief," he wrote. Texans deserve to "receive their fair share."\par \par \uc2 But Perry stands out for the vehemence and frequency of his rhetoric that government programs are threatening the nation's future. He also stands out for getting an especially large share of the benefits. During his tenure, Texas has ranked in the top quarter of states in federal funds received per capita, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\par \par \uc2 Perry has asked for money for bioterrorism preparedness at Texas hospitals, for state scientists mapping the bovine genome, for port improvements statewide and for border sheriffs who wanted better communications systems. He implored officials not to scale back the B-1, F-22 Raptor or C-17 fighter-jet projects, or NASA's manned space exploration program -- which are economically important to Texas' Air Force bases and the Johnson Space Center in Houston.\par \par \uc2 "He's `keep the federal government out of our business' and `everything from Washington is terrible,' and then he is quietly getting as much money as he can," said Jim Dunnam, a former Democratic state representative who once headed a House committee that tracked federal stimulus money sent to Texas.\par \par \uc2 Federal funds accounted for between 29 and 35 percent of the Texas state budget between 2000 and 2009, and stimulus money saw the percentage grow to near 40 percent in fiscal year 2010, according to the nonpartisan Legislative Budget Board. Nationwide, federal funds were in the 26 to 29.5 percent range in fiscal years 2008 and 2009, and hit 35 percent in stimulus-inflated 2010.\par \par \uc2 Richard Cole, a professor at the University of Texas at Arlington who has studied the relationship between states and the federal government, said that even without the stimulus spike, the percentage of federal funds in the Texas budget is now higher than it was under Perry's gubernatorial predecessors, Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Ann Richards.\par \par \uc2 "All governors ask for help from the federal government, but most aren't making the case Perry is making," said Cole, referring to his criticism of government programs.\par \par \uc2 Katherine Cesinger, a spokeswoman for Perry's campaign, noted that the governor refused to apply for $700 million in federal stimulus education grants that he said had too many conditions. He also turned down around $556 million for the Texas unemployment insurance program. Perry rejects federal intrusions on individual or state rights, she said, but added of Washington, "When it comes down to what their core responsibilities are, you bet we're going to try to hold them accountable and ask them for everything that Texans deserve."\par \par \uc2 Perry opposes the Obama administration health care overhaul, though Texas state agencies have received $56.9 million in Health and Human Services Department grants alone as part of it. The governor wrote a letter to Washington in August 2010 supporting a $1 million federal grant proposal that Texas wanted to explore setting up a related statewide health care exchange.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, Perry has taken credit for the $78 million in federal Justice Department grants he obtained for the border region between 2006 and 2010, and the $624 million Texas received under the Homeland Security Grant Program since 2005.\par \par \uc2 He also found himself defending a federal program in May 2009 when the Obama administration wanted to scrap the program's funding for imprisoning \uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2  felons.\par \par \uc2 In April 2003, Perry also sought a federal bailout for troubled airlines including American Airlines, headquartered in Dallas, and Continental, now part of \uc2 United Continental Holdings Inc\uc2 ., based in Houston.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020111114e7be001h2\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 HELENA, Mont. (AP) - No one can recall the last time an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  hiked into the rugged and remote wilderness of Glacier National Park in an attempt to slip into the U.S. But that isn't stopping some in Congress from proposing to give border agents control over environmental laws in protected areas such as the popular tourist attraction in Montana, Washington's North Cascades National Park and all federal land within 100 miles of the U.S. border.\par \par \uc2 Associated Press interviews with northern border local sheriffs, federal officials, land managers, advocacy groups and others find that border threats in places such as the mountainous peaks of Glacier National Park are far more infrequent than in the deserts of Texas or Arizona -- where illegal immigration arrests in one Border Patrol sector can run 1,000 times greater than a sector on the Canadian border.\par \par \uc2 The proposal would let the Border Patrol circumvent dozens of environmental laws from the Clean Water Act to the Endangered Species Act in areas those laws were created for: the nation's most-protected wilderness areas that fall within the 100-mile border zone with both Mexico and Canada. Supporters of the measure argue it is needed to cut through a bureaucratic gridlock where border agents have difficulty dealing with environmental laws and roadless rules.\par \par \uc2 But It has left critics wondering if the one-size-fits all approach to reshape border protection makes sense, and whether it's worth potentially marring wilderness areas that have been protected for a century or more.\par \par \uc2 Montana has become a flashpoint for the debate partly because much of the state's border with Canada is on federal land. And the dispute recently became a top issue in one of the nation's most competitive U.S. Senate races.\par \par \uc2 Rep. Denny Rehberg of Montana, a Republican co-sponsor of the House bill who is in the midst of a fierce campaign to unseat freshman Democratic Sen. Jon Tester in 2012, has argued environmental rules should not get in the way of border protection.\par \par \uc2 Tester has joined some hunters and conservationists who argue the bill is a heavy-handed fix that allows unchecked development in places they cherish.\par \par \uc2 It's not exactly clear what the Border Patrol would do with that new authority. The bill, which has 32 co-sponsors in the U.S. House, suggests the agency could build new roads, keep current roads open, establish bases or even use motorized equipment in the backcountry of the national parks to shore up border protection.\par \par \uc2 But critics and conservationists ask if the actual border threat is worth taking those measures. Unlike the border with Mexico, where illegal activity is a daily problem, the proposed law has so far met with more skepticism on the northern border where proof is scant that the likes of human traffickers are using the wilderness reaches of Montana, Idaho and Washington.\par \par \uc2 "Compared to the southern border it is an infinitesimally small number. It is like one in a year, not thousands," said North Cascades National Park superintendent Chip Jenkins, who believes the current laws are fine for his area of Washington state. "So far it has been working. Part of it is that the geography works to our advantage. It is incredibly rugged terrain, and very difficult to navigate."\par \par \uc2 About 14 years ago, a would-be terrorist tried to sneak into the country through North Cascades National Park, and in what the park service considers a success the man was caught by rangers. Gazi Ibrahim Abu Mezer later was caught again elsewhere by immigration officials, and after ignoring orders to leave the country, was arrested in Brooklyn, N.Y. with a pipe bomb.\par \par \uc2 Police and agents do report more smuggling activity in the national forests, compared to the parks, but sheriffs in northwestern Montana consider the problem to be rare.\par \par \uc2 "I would think it is occurring randomly. I don't think it is a continual problem," said Flathead County Sheriff Chuck Curry. "Most of our border area is relatively rugged and relatively inaccessible."\par \par \uc2 But Curry notes there is the potential for people to use the area as a crossing point, and there have been cases where electronic surveillance has been tripped at an abandoned port of entry just west of Glacier National Park in the Flathead National Forest.\par \par \uc2 "Somebody with the will and resources certainly could get across the border if they chose to," said Curry. "It certainly is not at the top of my list, but it is a concern, especially as it pertains to the flow of drugs across the border."\par \par \uc2 The Border Patrol in eastern Washington reports more active crossing in the national forests of that region. Spokesman James Frackelton notes several multimillion dollar seizures of drugs in recent years that were brought overland on foot. He said the British Columbia marijuana industry often sends product down south in exchange for cocaine headed north on public land smuggling routes that have been used as far back as prohibition when booze flowed south from Canada.\par \par \uc2 Frackleton said that designated wilderness areas that prevent motorized access are a frustration for border agents, and pointed out his agency views access differently than the Forest Service or Park Service.\par \par \uc2 "They are protecting natural resources and our mission is to protect the U.S. from terrorists, terrorist weapons and other threats," he said.\par \par \uc2 In the plains of Montana most of the border land is owned by private landowners or perhaps local governments-- more similar to ownership patterns predominant in Midwestern or northeastern states -- and not the federal government. In that portion of rural Montana, border agents and local sheriffs report a few incidents of smuggling though rural farm fields. However, the proposal in Congress targets border patrol access to federal land -- not private farms.\par \par \uc2 Republican Rep. Rob Bishop of Utah is carrying the bill that eases the restrictions and recently passed the House Natural Resources Committee along party lines. But it is one of the many GOP co-sponsors, Rehberg of Montana, who has been taking heat.\par \par \uc2 Recently, in a development potentially even more troublesome for the Republican supporters of the bill, some conservative writers have begun speaking out against it. In places like Montana where many libertarian-minded gun owners are wary of potential federal government intrusions, the idea of granting border agents new authority in the name of increased security is raising some hackles.\par \par \uc2 Chuck Baldwin, a former Constitution Party presidential candidate who is now active in Montana conservative circles, criticized Rehberg's support for the bill and recently wrote that the proposal gives "more power and authority to the federal government's emerging police state."\par \par \uc2 Rehberg, who has already worked to change the bill to ensure that border agents could not restrict hunting or other public access to land, made it clear through a spokesman that his continued support for the measure is not certain. Rehberg, in an obvious effort to appease his conservative base, has suggested the bill could be improved by requiring the border patrol first get the permission of the local sheriff before exercising the powers granted.\par \par \uc2 "The bill is still not perfect. And he is working to make it better," spokesman Jed Link said. "But at the end of the day, if this thing is not good for Montana, Denny is not going to support it."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020111113e7bd0026c\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) - Amid a federal push to boost college graduation rates, higher education officials from Kansas and Missouri gathered Tuesday to talk about barriers to people entering and completing college.\par \par \uc2 President Barack Obama has set a goal for the U.S. to have the best college graduation rate in the world by 2020. Korea is ranked first, with 58 percent of its population ages 25-34 having finished college; the U.S. is in a four-way tie for ninth place at 42 percent, according to a study published last year by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.\par \par \uc2 To regain the top spot, the Education Department projects the nation will need to raise its completion rate by 50 percent, which translates into an additional 8 million students earning associate's or bachelor's degrees by the end of the decade.\par \par \uc2 The rising cost of higher education and the challenges transfer students face were among the topics discussed during the education summit at the University of Missouri-Kansas City. University and community college leaders also shared ideas for recruiting and retaining students from underrepresented populations.\par \par \uc2 University of Kansas chancellor Bernadette Gray-Little told participants of her experience leaving her segregated town in North Carolina for college and getting no help from her parents paying for her schooling.\par \par \uc2 "When I think about it, in some ways my aspiration was a bold one," said Gray-Little, who became the university's first black chancellor. "I think that in our society it should not be unrealistic or bold for any student who has the capability to go to college. It should be the expectation."\par \par \uc2 She talked about how the school has broadened student financial support and is working to notify students soon after their admission how much scholarship money they will receive. The school also is encouraging students to graduate within four years so they will incur less debt. And the school has recruitment efforts geared specifically toward students from underrepresented populations.\par \par \uc2 "I believe that as a university, we are moving closer to creating an environment where all students, no matter what their backgrounds, whether there are financial considerations or other circumstances, can aspire and expect to go to college," Gray-Little said. "And that's really what we expect."\par \par \uc2 One of the sessions dealt with the issue of illegal immigration. Last year Congress failed to pass the DREAM Act, which would have allowed young people to become legal U.S. residents after spending two years in college or the military. It applied to those who were under 16 when they arrived in the U.S., had been in the country at least five years and had a diploma from a U.S. high school or the equivalent.\par \par \uc2 Some states, such as Kansas, allow children of illegal immigrants to qualify for in-state tuition if they meet certain requirements. But that's not true in Missouri.\par \par \uc2 Regardless of where \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students live, it's impossible for them to qualify for federal aid such as Pell grants. The lack of a valid Social Security number can make certain programs off limits, such as nursing, which requires a state certification. After graduation, the lack of documentation interferes with job searches, said presenter Gene Chavez, a counselor at East High School in the Kansas City, Mo., School District.\par \par \uc2 "I sit in my office talking to undocumented students who are bright students, who could go to almost any college or university across the country," he said "They invariably ask me the question, `Why am I doing all of this if I can't go any further than I can go without a valid Social Security number?' I just have to tell them, `We are hoping, we are praying we are working to change the laws of this country, but it hasn't happened yet.'\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020111109e7b90003t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ATLANTA (AP) - Opponents of a policy that effectively bans illegal immigrants from Georgia's most competitive state colleges and universities on Tuesday asked the university system to overturn it.\par \par \uc2 "This policy effectively tells an entire group of perfectly qualified students that they're not good enough solely because of their immigration status," Juan Carlos Cardoza-Oquendo, a senior at the University of Georgia and the son of immigrants, told the committee.\par \par \uc2 The Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia last year implemented the policy barring any school that has rejected academically qualified applicants in the previous two years from accepting illegal immigrants. That includes five Georgia colleges and universities: the University of Georgia, Georgia Tech, Georgia State University, Georgia Health Sciences University and Georgia College & State University. Illegal immigrants may still be admitted to any other state college or university, provided that they pay out-of-state tuition.\par \par \uc2 Keish Kim, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Korea, also testified before the committee. She is currently taking a class offered by Freedom University, a program offered by several University of Georgia professors on their own time that is open to students regardless of their immigration status or ability to pay.\par \par \uc2 "My parents brought me here in hopes of giving me the opportunity to dream higher than they ever could," she said. "But here in Georgia it has stopped me even before I had the chance to spread my wings."\par \par \uc2 Cardoza-Oquendo argued that a study the Regents themselves conducted proved that illegal immigrants were not a burden on Georgia's university system.\par \par \uc2 The Regents conducted the study last year amid public concerns that Georgia state colleges and universities were being overrun by illegal immigrants, that taxpayers were subsidizing their education and legal residents were being displaced. The study found that less than 1 percent of the state's public college students were illegal immigrants, and that students who pay out-of-state tuition more than pay for their education.\par \par \uc2 The committee members listened to the students and then committee vice chair Mansfield Jennings thanked them for their perspective.\par \par \uc2 "Thank you all for being with us and thank you for bringing us this educated idea," Jennings said, adding that he wasn't sure when the full board might take up the issue or when a decision might be made.\par \par \uc2 A coalition of groups opposing the policy also held a news conference Tuesday afternoon outside the Capitol to urge the Regents to rescind the policy.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020111108e7b80019e\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

Kind of like me. Tells it like it is."\par \par \uc2 "When is your story going to run?" was another oft-repeated question from the man who then insisted he doesn't have an ego. "I'm a private person. .... These people ... these television stations from all over the world ... they come to me. They want to talk to me."\par \par \uc2 Besides Cain, Arpaio met last month with Republican candidate Michele Bachmann. And he says he has recently had telephone conversations with Texas Gov. Rick Perry and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney. In the 2008 Republican presidential primary he endorsed Romney over Phoenix's own Sen. John McCain. But that doesn't mean he will automatically back him this time around.\par \par \uc2 "He forgot to invite me to his fundraiser," the sheriff noted with a twinge of resentment.\par \par \uc2 So are all four seeking his endorsement?\par \par \uc2 "Well, I'm pretty sure Perry and Romney and Michele, yeah," Arpaio said. "Herman, not right out. I didn't get much time to talk to him. He was late."\par \par \uc2 Perry spokesman Mark Miner confirmed the Arpaio-Perry meeting. Perry has taken heat from his GOP rivals for what they consider his soft stance on immigration, including allowing in-state university tuition rates and a path to citizenship for \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  high school students. An Arpaio spokesman, Jeff Sprong, said the Texas governor contacted Arpaio a second time last week.\par \par \uc2 Romney and Bachmann campaign spokesman did not respond to telephone calls and emails asking for interviews on why the candidates were courting Arpaio. Cain spokesman J.D. Gordon, however, characterized the visits and phone calls as fact-finding missions.\par \par \uc2 "All the candidates are trying to get up to speed on the border," he said. "... All the campaigns are reaching out to a wide variety of experts on a number of issues. Naturally, the border issue is one that will be central to the 2012 election, and therefore the candidates in general are trying to get as many opinions as they have."\par \par \uc2 Dan Schnur, a former GOP strategist who now teaches at the University of Southern California, called Arpaio "a precise human representation of the importance of the debate over illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 "We've already seen how volatile the issue has become in the Republican primary, so candidates who might be vulnerable in this debate would see Arpaio as protection against criticism. But that same debate plays out much different in the general election, so his support has both risks and benefits attached."\par \par \uc2 And at least one Republican Hispanic group, Somos Republicans, warns that it will also be working aggressively at the grass-roots level during the primary to promote only immigrant-friendly candidates.\par \par \uc2 "With regard to Perry consulting Arpaio, we did push back against him," said Dee Dee Blas\u233\'00\'E9, former president of Somos Republicans. "We sent him a strong message that that's a no-no. So hopefully Perry will pick up on that and not do that again."\par \par \uc2 But for congressional and statehouse candidates across the country, Arpaio's endorsement has become almost a brand, a stamp of approval for strong anti-immigration policies.\par \par \uc2 "I know of nobody who has the profile that Sheriff Joe has," Arizona Senate President Russell Pearce, the architect of Arizona's tough immigration enforcement law, said in an interview last year.\par \par \uc2 Indeed, Arpaio advocates -- and practices -- some of the toughest anti-immigration policies in the country. A retired Drug Enforcement Agent who worked in the Middle East, Mexico and Texas before retiring in Arizona, he says he would send troops into Mexico to catch the immigrants before they hit the border. And those who do make it across should be charged with felonies, like they are when caught by raids on his turf.\par \par \uc2 While Arpaio has become synonymous with radical immigration laws, he built his reputation for being tough on crime when he first took office in 1993 and erected a compound of tents to house jail inmates. It's the epitome of hard time, with temperatures sometimes hitting 145 degrees. He also resurrected old-fashioned chain gangs.\par \par \uc2 Arpaio seemingly only softens when he speaks of animals. He was recently the featured singer at a humane association fundraiser, and he brags that some of the county's old -- and more comfortable jail cells -- are now used by the county animal shelter.\par \par \uc2 While Arpaio has long been courted by anti-immigration politicians around the country, he says interest in him rose again after Obama announced a plan to halt the deportation of some 300,000 illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 That put the immigration issue back at the forefront of the presidential campaigns, he said.\par \par \uc2 "Nobody is saying anything," Arpaio said. "But I'm glad it's back on the table. I'm glad they are talking about it. People will be interested in it instead of just the economy. So I'm going to keep stimulating that and they can keep coming down here and visiting me, which confuses me. Why would they want to visit me?"\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writers Jacques Billeaud in Phoenix and Steve Peoples in New Hampshire contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Follow Jeri Clausing on Twitter at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://twitter.com/jericlausing"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://twitter.com/jericlausing}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020111108e7b80013i\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 DENVER (AP) - Nearly half of audited Colorado employers are not complying with a state law to verify the legal status of newly hired workers, according to a report released Monday.\par \par \uc2 An analysis from the Colorado Auditor's office found that 48 percent of 404 employers audited by the state Division of Labor in 2010 didn't comply with state law. State auditors emphasized that non-compliance doesn't mean an employer hired an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  and that lack of awareness about the law is a significant barrier to compliance.\par \par \uc2 The state audit of the division, which is charged with making sure employers are following the law, also found that officials aren't being thorough in reviewing and investigating employer compliance.\par \par \uc2 The 2006 law requires employers to have paperwork showing they've reviewed a worker's legal status and are keeping copies of employment authorization forms and worker's identification. That's in addition to having federal I-9 forms to document that workers are authorized to work in the U.S.\par \par \uc2 Non-compliance peaked in 2007 -- the year the law took effect -- when the rate reached 68 percent. The four-year average for non-compliance is 55 percent, among 1,140 employers audited by the Division of Labor.\par \par \uc2 "Since the law came into effect in January of 2007, we've seen a decrease in the number of employers who are non-compliant, so the word is getting out," said Michael McArdle, the division's director.\par \par \uc2 Employers who don't follow the law can be fined $5,000 for the first offense and $25,000 for subsequent offenses.\par \par \uc2 The state audit said the division needs to improve its practices to ensure employer compliance with the law. For example, auditors found that division officials in some cases missed relevant facts in their investigations of employers, including late or unsigned affirmations by employers stating that they had followed the state guidelines for verification of a worker's legal status.\par \par \uc2 The state law requires that employers complete documentation showing they reviewed a worker's legal status within 20 days of the hire date. But in some instances, the state audit found that division officials found employers to be compliant, even when the employers backdated their affirmations.\par \par \uc2 Auditors recommended that division officials implement a process where supervisors inspect completed reviews of employer compliance. McArdle said his division is working to implement the audit's recommendations.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020111107e7b7002hb\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

Duncan says he supports allowing kids of illegal immigrants to pay in-state tuition\b0\par\par\uc2 By KIMBERLY HEFLING   \par \uc2 AP Education Writer\par \uc2 544 \uc2 words\par \uc2 7 November 2011\par 16:51\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2011.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) - Education Secretary Arne Duncan said Monday he's encouraged that some states are allowing the children of illegal immigrants to pay in-state tuition at public colleges.\par \par \uc2 As an example, Duncan pointed to Rhode Island, where this fall the Rhode Island Board of Governors for Higher Education unanimously approved in-state tuition for illegal immigrants starting in fall 2012.\par \par \uc2 Another dozen states have similar laws or policies, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. In contrast, four states have laws specifically prohibiting \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students from receiving in-state tuition, and two states bar those who are illegally in the country from attending public secondary schools altogether, the National Conference of State Legislatures said.\par \par \uc2 Duncan said some of the children of illegal immigrants came to the United States when they were infants. He said the United States is their home, where they've worked hard in school and taken on leadership roles. For too long, he said, the U.S. policy toward them has been backward.\par \par \uc2 "They are either going to be taxpayers and productive citizens and entrepreneurs and innovators or they are going to be on the sidelines and a drag on the economy," Duncan said in an interview with The Associated Press.\par \par \uc2 The topic has been an issue in the GOP presidential primary race, with Texas Gov. Rick Perry taking criticism from rival contenders for supporting a law that allows illegal immigrants to get in-state tuition at Texas universities if they meet other residency requirements\par \par \uc2 Under the Rhode Island policy, in-state rates will be available only to illegal immigrants' children who have attended a high school in the state for at least three years and graduated or received a GED. Students will lose their resident tuition unless they commit to seek legal status as soon as they are eligible.\par \par \uc2 The Pew Hispanic Center has said the number of Hispanic college students ages 18 to 24 increased by 24 percent, meaning about 35,000 additional young Hispanics were in college in 2010 compared to a year earlier. It's the largest such increase. Duncan said he was pleased to see the increase and will be monitoring the students to see if they graduate.\par \par \uc2 Duncan supported the DREAM ACT, which Congress failed to pass last year. That legislation would have allowed young people to become legal U.S. residents after spending two years in college or the military. It applied to those who were under 16 when they arrived in the U.S., had been in the country at least five years and had a diploma from a U.S. high school or the equivalent.\par \par \uc2 Also on Monday, the Lumina Foundation, which seeks to expand educational opportunities for students beyond high school, announced it will provide $7.2 million over a four-year period to 12 partnerships in 10 states with significant and growing Latino populations. The effort seeks to leverage community leaders across the education, business and nonprofit sector.\par \par \uc2 ----------\par \par \uc2 Kimberly Hefling can be followed at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://twitter.com/khefling"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://twitter.com/khefling}}}\par \par \uc2 --------\par \par \uc2 Online: National Conference of State Legislatures background on state laws: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.ncsl.org/default.aspx?tabid12876"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.ncsl.org/default.aspx?tabid12876}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020111107e7b7002fh\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHOENIX (AP) - The number of illegal immigrants caught by the Border Patrol during the last year in southern Arizona dropped by more than 40 percent, the head of U.S. Customs and Border Protection said.\par \par \uc2 Alan Bersin told the Arizona Republic ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://bit.ly/uBiPrG"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://bit.ly/uBiPrG}}}\uc2  ) that about 123,000 illegal immigrants were arrested in the Border Patrol's Tucson Sector between October 2010 and September 2011. That's a 42 percent decrease from the 212,000 detained the previous 12 months.\par \par \uc2 The much smaller Yuma Sector saw its arrests go from 7,115 to 5,833, an 18 percent decline.\par \par \uc2 Illegal immigrant\uc2  arrests along the entire U.S.-Mexico border peaked at 1.6 million in 2000, including more than 616,000 in the Tucson Sector.\par \par \uc2 The numbers are preliminary. Official statistics won't be released for several weeks, but Bersin revealed the totals to Border Patrol agents in Nogales and later to the Republic.\par \par \uc2 "This is the year we close the lid on this sector," Bersin told The Republic.\par \par \uc2 Total arrests across the entire U.S. Mexico border for the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30 are expected to be at their lowest levels since 321,000 in 1972.\par \par \uc2 Bersin toured the border last week with Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano.\par \par \uc2 The Obama administration has deployed National Guard troops and has been adding new fencing, technology and agents along the border to make it more difficult to cross illegally. They also have been beefing up immigration enforcement and added more border agents. In fiscal 2011, deportations were at an all-time high.\par \par \uc2 Those factors, coupled with the grim U.S. job market, have driven the number of arrests down. Erik Lee, associate director of the North American Center for Transborder Studies, a think tank based at Arizona State University, said Mexico's booming economy also creates less incentive for illegal immigrants to head to the U.S. to find jobs.\par \par \uc2 Arizona has been the most popular gateway for clandestine border crossings for years and a flashpoint in the national debate over illegal immigration. Politicians routinely demanding that the administration secure the border.\par \par \uc2 Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a critic of Obama administration's border policies, acknowledged that the government buildup has had some positive results, but he said there remains more to be done to secure the border. Overall, the measures still have not "kept up with the escalation of violence on the other side of the border," which poses a threat to the United States, McCain said. Fencing and technology is still insufficient and a larger National Guard presence is needed at the border, he said.\par \par \uc2 "I not only acknowledge but am pleased to note some improvements. I just don't think there have been enough," said McCain, who sits on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.\par \par \uc2 President Barack Obama has repeatedly pointed to continuing declines in Border Patrol arrests as evidence that he has increased border security.\par \par \uc2 "In the general election, no doubt President Obama is going to make the case that his policies are working," said Larry Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia. "The natural comeback is to say, `Your bad economy is producing a lower arrest rate because there aren't that many coming over.' "\par \par \uc2 Republican presidential candidates have accused Obama of not doing enough to secure the border while pledging to beef up border enforcement in recent debates leading up to Republican primaries. Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann signed a pledge in October promising to secure the border. Herman Cain called for an electric fence to deter illegal border crossers, but then said he was joking after the remark triggered heavy criticism and protests.\par \par \uc2 Bersin and Napolitano say the sharp drop in Border Patrol arrests in Tucson and along the Southwest border in general indicates a decrease in \uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2  traffic. They credited the addition of thousands of Border Patrol agents, more fencing, additional technology and increased air support.\par \par \uc2 "We've got more manpower down here than ever before," Napolitano said in a meeting with agents in the Nogales Sector. "We've got more technology for you to use than ever before. We've got more infrastructure here than ever before, and it's making a huge, huge difference and that difference can be measured in every statistical way."\par \par \uc2 But McCain pointed to the major Arizona drug-trafficking bust announced Monday, which resulted in 76 arrests of suspected border scouts, drug runners and others allegedly connected to Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel.\par \par \uc2 "Well, the good news is we busted them, but the bad news is they were there," he said.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Information from: The Arizona Republic, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.azcentral.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.azcentral.com}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020111105e7b5003ee\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc72}{\*\bkmkend toc72}\b \uc2 Cal guard Jorge Gutierrez appreciates the hard path he took to become a college star\b0\par\par\uc2 By JANIE McCAULEY   \par \uc2 AP Sports Writer\par \uc2 1,800 \uc2 words\par \uc2 3 November 2011\par 18:07\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2011.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) - Jorge Gutierrez still remembers bits and pieces from the day he crossed the Mexican border at 15 to begin a new life in the United States.\par \par \uc2 His parents, Bertha and Fernando, dropped their son off in Denver and helped him sign up for school before returning to their hectic lives in Chihuahua, Mexico, to work and care for two older sons. It was an excruciating choice for the tight-knit family. Gutierrez, who recalls his sadness at the time, would have to get by speaking very limited English while living far from home with three other Mexican teens just as determined to build a future by making the same huge sacrifice.\par \par \uc2 "You always think about it. It's something that marked my life forever," said Gutierrez, now a star guard for No. 24 California. "It's been a while, but I don't forget about those things. I learned a lot of stuff."\par \par \uc2 Gutierrez moved to Denver to play at Lincoln High, a school that is currently close to 97 percent Hispanic and enrolls the Spanish-speaking students who need a place to thrive -- and did Gutierrez ever do so. He led Lincoln to a state championship while facing constant scrutiny, racism and speculation that he and his countrymen were using false birth certificates or transcripts and shouldn't get to play. Let alone trounce on all the teams with American-born players.\par \par \uc2 He was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  for a time before receiving a student visa, which was updated when he arrived at Cal. Gutierrez spent his final high school season at Findlay Prep in Henderson, Nev., after it was determined he needed more credits.\par \par \uc2 The fiery Gutierrez landed almost by accident in Berkeley as fourth-year Cal coach Mike Montgomery's first recruit. The Golden Bears needed a fill-in guard at the last minute after another transferred, and Gutierrez was both available and on Montgomery's list of recommended players.\par \par \uc2 Gutierrez has earned a reputation as one of the toughest, hardest-working players in the new Pac-12.\par \par \uc2 Some say Cal hasn't had a player who hustles, hits the ground for loose balls and flies around the court with this kind of energy since the days of Jason Kidd.\par \par \uc2 "It's an honor, but to be honest, I don't like when they compare me to anybody," Gutierrez said. "That's who they are. I have my own ways. I work hard because I want to work hard and I want to be successful. I want to be the best I can be. This is me. This is who I am."\par \par \uc2 By Gutierrez's definition, he is a much more than just a basketball player.\par \par \uc2 "First of all, I like people to know I'm a son. I'm a pretty nice son. I can be a very good friend as well," he said. "Pretty mellow guy, very quiet. Once I open up I can be a pretty nice person."\par \par \uc2 And feisty once he hits the floor.\par \par \uc2 Some of that grit developed during those tough times in Denver.\par \par \uc2 He arrived as a frightened kid, forced to grow up in a hurry. In his case, crossing the border was the easy part.\par \par \uc2 "I can tell you about the little pictures that I have in my mind," said Gutierrez, now 22, on a student visa and six months from earning a college degree. "It was nothing difficult because I had a tourist visa at the time. I was nervous, of course, because after I crossed the border I was going to be illegal because tourists can't go to school, can't work, can't live by themselves. The experience of crossing the border wasn't as hard as the experience of living in the United States. ...\par \par \uc2 "I always think about my family, my mom. I cannot imagine how hard it was for her to let me go."\par \par \uc2 While the young men had the support of their coaches, teachers and other parents, they sustained on "each other, really."\par \par \uc2 Food often was scarce.\par \par \uc2 When Gutierrez struggled to get through games and bruised easily, it was determined he was anemic -- his iron deficiency perhaps caused from being undernourished.\par \par \uc2 "If we had food we would share with each other. That was just the way it was. We became a family," he said, opening up to The Associated Press in a recent interview. "If it's going to look like I'm crying about it, I wouldn't talk about it, because it's something personal. I'm very proud of what I went through. If it's something that's going to help people, then I'm totally open."\par \par \uc2 There is no outward evidence of Gutierrez's struggles. He has added strength each year through his rigorous routine in the weight room, and it shows.\par \par \uc2 He pulls his shoulder-length black hair back into a bun, which he plans as his signature 'do for this season. He has a beard to match.\par \par \uc2 Gutierrez is an enigma of sorts in the college game -- from his style to his path. Though Montgomery would sign Gutierrez all over again if he could.\par \par \uc2 "One can only imagine what his background was and what he's had to put up with to get here," Montgomery said. "I would be real surprised if any of the coaches said anything different, he is just an unbelievable kid to coach. He can be stubborn and he has his little quirks, but you watch him now and he's so much more confident. There are certain things he does as well as anybody. His midrange game, curling off screens, is really good. Finishing at the basket, defending, it's great to see."\par \par \uc2 Gutierrez was named Cal's top defender last season, when he averaged a team-leading 14.6 points and also grabbed 3.8 rebounds per game.\par \par \uc2 It was fellow Chihuahuan and 11-year NBA veteran Eduardo Najera who helped set an example for basketball players in Mexico.\par \par \uc2 More than half of the players on Gutierrez's state title Lincoln team were from Mexico.\par \par \uc2 "I've never seen a kid that will go to any lengths to win, whether it's being here on his own or practicing three to four hours in a day," Lincoln coach Vince Valdez said. "That's just how Jorge is, he's flat-out a winner and has been instrumental in every team winning wherever he has been."\par \par \uc2 What Gutierrez missed most through his remarkable journey was being a typical teen.\par \par \uc2 He sees his parents about once a year, but traveled home twice this summer -- once to visit his family and then later to play with the national team.\par \par \uc2 "I got to play in front of them with the Mexican jersey on. That was special," he said. "If you would ask me what I missed most about it? Just being a kid. I missed being a kid. I had to grow up faster than most kids had to. I missed my family, but I thank them at the same time. They let me go, even though it was hard, they let me go. Because I had a dream."\par \par \uc2 His parents will come for the Bears' season opener Nov. 13 and again for his May graduation.\par \par \uc2 Gutierrez faced scrutiny, protests and racism, but he insists he never felt that he or his friends were in danger. He deals with some of the same issues back home because "they don't agree with me being here. It's just politics."\par \par \uc2 That's a lot to endure for a teen, especially in a foreign place with no parental guidance.\par \par \uc2 "To the average adolescent it would be, but these young men were so resilient they turned it into a motivational piece," Valdez said. "It was an us-against-them mentality. They were more calloused for what they had undergone. They learned to deal with the pressure. The pressure actually made us. That helped develop the chip on Jorge's shoulder he plays with, that people didn't want to see him succeed."\par \par \uc2 Popular and controversial Denver talk radio host, Peter Boyles, called out the Mexican teens. They were ridiculed and stereotyped.\par \par \uc2 They stood their ground, on the court and off.\par \par \uc2 "We wanted to prove something. It was about basketball. It wasn't about ethnicity or race," Gutierrez recalled. "It was just kids playing basketball. That's what it was. We wanted to teach people that we are all equal and we were all playing for a goal, which was winning."\par \par \uc2 Gutierrez is now well-spoken in English after all the struggles to communicate when he first arrived.\par \par \uc2 His first two years in Berkeley were spent largely on the bench, though Gutierrez's influence in practice forced Montgomery to take note.\par \par \uc2 "I could make something up and make it seem like we were clairvoyant and saw what he was going to be. We were stuck and needed somebody," Montgomery said. "We took a gamble and obviously it's paid off."\par \par \uc2 Gutierrez is thankful Montgomery discovered him at the right time for both men.\par \par \uc2 Then, there was Gutierrez wearing blue and gold, diving for loose balls all over the floor in Haas Pavilion.\par \par \uc2 "He found out about me. He gave me a chance. That's all I needed," he said. "I'm big on saying, 'I don't need easy, I need possible.' I proved to myself I could play at this level. I didn't want to stop there. Every day I keep pushing myself to play with the best in the world."\par \par \uc2 Montgomery believes that very well could happen. After Gutierrez produces a special senior season in Berkeley, that is.\par \par \uc2 "I don't want to put the hex on him, but I think Jorge has a chance to play in the NBA," said Montgomery, who spent two seasons coaching the Golden State Warriors. "People aren't going to look at him at first blush and say that because he doesn't do this or doesn't do that. But when I put him on the team after all that, I said, 'God, dang, he's everywhere, he's doing everything.' He ties the whole thing together."\par \par \uc2 Gutierrez never thought this far ahead back when he moved to the U.S.\par \par \uc2 Before an open gym session this fall, Gutierrez walked down the arena hallway with his arm around teammate Emerson Murray.\par \par \uc2 "Every day, every practice, every game, I think I live it to the max," Gutierrez said. "I don't regret anything I've done and I feel I live everything to the max. ...\par \par \uc2 "I'm happy. I'm happy with what I have."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020111103e7b3002y8\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SALT LAKE CITY (AP) - A Utah man hatched a creative scheme to avoid going to prison on a drug charge: He lied to authorities and said he was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  so he could get deported to Mexico and evade time behind bars.\par \par \uc2 The jig was up, however, when 27-year-old Jaime Alvarado returned to the U.S. using his passport and was arrested again by Salt Lake City police.\par \par \uc2 The tactic exploited a system in which law enforcement officials sometimes prefer deporting \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  offenders instead of adding to an already overloaded prison system.\par \par \uc2 At the time of his initial arrest, Alvarado claimed he was Saul Quiroz and had emigrated from Mexico illegally. He is actually an American citizen.\par \par \uc2 On Feb. 3, he admitted to a state judge that he had lied about his identity because he was afraid of leaving his daughters with an imprisoned father. He requested leniency for the crime he had pleaded guilty to prior to his deportation -- a second-degree felony for possession of cocaine and heroin with the intent to distribute -- that carried a prison term of up to 15 years.\par \par \uc2 "I have a good job right now, a lot of little girls waiting for me and a family that will support me," Alvarado said in a letter to the judge. "It's my first offense and my last. I want to spend the rest of my life with my kids!"\par \par \uc2 But Wednesday, Salt Lake County prosecutors charged Alvarado with an additional felony and a misdemeanor for lying about his identity in 2010 to the judge, police officers and federal immigration officers. A $50,000 warrant has been issued for his arrest, since Alvarado failed to report to state authorities in June after U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers determined he was legally present in the country.\par \par \uc2 An attorney has not been appointed for Alvarado, and a current phone number cannot be located for him.\par \par \uc2 Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokeswoman Lori Haley said the agency is aware of the case, which is still under investigation. Agency officials also said it's not infrequent for people to lie about their nationality or claim to be illegal immigrants, either to evade prosecution or avoid incarceration or conditions of probation.\par \par \uc2 Rishi Oza, an immigration attorney with the Cleveland-based firm of Robert Brown LLC, said Alvarado's plan is "not a risk I'd ever want to take because you're creating a bigger hole for yourself." Along with the additional charges leveled against Alvarado, there is also the chance that a person could be forced to serve their prison sentence and then get deported.\par \par \uc2 "I have never seen something like this happen. More often than not, the situation works the other way -- a person claims to be legal to avoid detection," Oza said. "I have never seen an American citizen try to get deported."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Josh Loftin can be reached at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://twitter.com/joshloftin"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://twitter.com/joshloftin}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020111103e7b3002n2\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) - Alabama's attorney general is questioning the U.S. Justice Department's legal authority to get enrollment information about all students in many Alabama school districts as part of its federal lawsuit challenging the state's tough new immigration law.\par \par \uc2 Attorney General Luther Strange sent a letter to the Justice Department on Wednesday asking to be told by Friday what legal authority the department had to get the information.\par \par \uc2 "Otherwise, I will assume you have none, and will proceed accordingly," the Republican attorney general wrote. He did not elaborate on his next step.\par \par \uc2 Alabama's interim school superintendent, Larry Craven, advised school superintendents to hold off on providing any information to the Justice Department until the department and the attorney general resolve their differences.\par \par \uc2 The Justice Department sent letters Monday to 39 school superintendents seeking lists that include the race and national origin of students, as well as whether English is their primary language. Justice Department attorneys also want the names of students who have withdrawn from school and the dates they left.\par \par \uc2 The Obama administration is concerned that the law enacted by Alabama's GOP-controlled legislature this year may discourage students from going to school. The agency wants the information to determine if further action is warranted.\par \par \uc2 Justice Department spokeswoman Xochitl Hinojosa said the letter went to districts with significant Hispanic populations. Alabama has 132 school districts.\par \par \uc2 Federal courts have put on hold a portion of Alabama's law that requires schools to report the number, but not the names, of students whose immigration status is in question.\par \par \uc2 State Sen. Scott Beason, a Gardendale Republican who sponsored the law, said the Justice Department's letter shows the importance of compiling information. "They are asking for the same student information we tried to get. They are proving our point," he said.\par \par \uc2 The Justice Department's letter reminds school superintendents that the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1982 that schools may not deny a student access based on immigration status and that the Justice Department enforces civil rights laws.\par \par \uc2 Beason said the Alabama law only sought statistics and did not deny enrollment to any \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Michael Sibley, spokesman for the state Department of Education, said the Justice Department went directly to city and county superintendents rather than going through the department. He said he's not aware of the Justice Department ever seeking lists of students' names before in Alabama.\par \par \uc2 He said schools would need to devote significant resources and staff time to meet the Justice Department's deadline of Nov. 14.\par \par \uc2 The state Department of Education released enrollment figures Wednesday showing that 34,220 Hispanic students were enrolled in Alabama schools on the 20th day of school, which was around Oct. 4 for most school systems. That was about a week after the immigration law took effect.\par \par \uc2 The enrollment figures showed the number of Hispanic students was up 960 from the same time last year, but they do not show how many left school between the time the law took effect Sept. 29 and when the enrollment count was taken.\par \par \uc2 The trends varied among systems with significant Hispanic enrollments. For instance, Baldwin County was down 50 from last year, but Marshall County was up 36.\par \par \uc2 The Hispanic enrollment represents 4.6 percent of Alabama's total public school enrollment of 736,339.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020111102e7b200233\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

Council will consider an emergency resolution opposing interference by Congress in local affairs.\par \par \uc2 Councilmember Mary Cheh, a Ward 3 Democrat, plans to introduce the resolution Tuesday. It's intended as a response to a bill introduced Monday by Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., that would require criminal background checks for mayoral appointees in the district.\par \par \uc2 The Council is considering a bill introduced by Cheh that would also require background checks and make other changes to government hiring practices. Cheh says the House bill is unnecessary and insulting.\par \par \uc2 Both bills were prompted by revelations about Sulaimon Brown, a former mayoral candidate who was hired by Mayor Vincent Gray in January, then fired after less than a month.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 MANASSAS, Va. (AP) - A judge on Monday found a Bolivian immigrant guilty of murder for causing a crash while driving drunk that killed a Benedictine nun and severely injured two others last year.\par \par \uc2 The case against Carlos Martinelly Montano, 24, drew national attention partly because of the sympathetic victims -- three elderly nuns -- but mostly because of Martinelly's immigration status. Federal authorities say Martinelly was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who had been convicted of drunken driving twice previously but was never deported.\par \par \uc2 Political leaders in Prince William County, a suburban county just outside the nation's capital where illegal immigration has been a flashpoint, seized on Martinelly's case as proof that federal authorities weren't sufficiently aggressive in deporting of criminal illegal aliens.\par \par \uc2 Monday's conviction also appeared to set a legal precedent in Virginia. Both prosecutors and defense attorneys say it appears to be the first reported case in the state where the murder laws were used in this fashion to prosecute a drunken-driving fatality.\par \par \uc2 Martinelly pleaded guilty at the outset of Monday's trial to lesser charges, including involuntary manslaughter. But his lawyers strongly disputed the murder charge, saying Martinelly's actions -- while negligent -- lacked the element of malice that is required for a murder conviction.\par \par \uc2 "He did not set out to injure anyone," defense attorney Dimitri Willis said. "He was running an errand."\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors acknowledged that the death of Sister Denise Mosier, 66, who lived in a convent in Richmond, was unintentional. But they argued that Virginia law allows a murder conviction when a death occurs in furtherance of an underlying felony, and in Virginia a third conviction for driving while intoxicated is classified as a felony.\par \par \uc2 Assistant Commonwealth's Attorney Ronald Reel also argued that "a person driving under the influence of alcohol is a mobile bomb" and that Martinelly should have foreseen the consequences of his actions.\par \par \uc2 Circuit Court Judge Lon E. Farris agreed, and convicted Martinelly of murder following a half-day trial. Martinelly waived his right to a jury and agreed to a bench trial.\par \par \uc2 "Driving under the influence is an inherently dangerous activity which the defendant voluntarily undertook" and he should have known it would result in injuries or death, the judge said.\par \par \uc2 During the trial, police officer Luis Zamora said Martinelly admitted he had been drinking for several days leading up to the Sunday morning crash, and said he was upset that his family had left him behind while they took a vacation to the beach. Officers found roughly 20 empty Coors Light cans in Martinelly's car.\par \par \uc2 The two surviving nuns also testified. Sister Connie Ruth Lupton said she remembers nothing at all about the day of the crash, and her first memory is weeks later, when the hospital took her off a ventilator. She suffered 14 broken bones and had her left thumb severed by her seat belt from the impact of the crash. She said her spine is "connected with screws and pins" and she now walks with a cane.\par \par \uc2 The nun who was driving the car on Bristow Road, Charlotte Lange, said she "remembered a car coming at me at a distance" followed by a huge impact.\par \par \uc2 "I remember hearing Connie moaning, `Oh me! Oh me!'" Lange testified. When a passer-by came to render aid, Lange insisted on calling her mother superior to let her know that she wouldn't make it to the annual retreat to which the nuns had been headed.\par \par \uc2 "I remember telling her, `We've been in a terrible head-on crash. It's not good,'" Lange said.\par \par \uc2 Mosier was pronounced dead at the scene. Martinelly and the two nuns were taken to the hospital by helicopter.\par \par \uc2 Martinelly's immigration status did not come up once during the trial. Outside of court, Commonwealth's Attorney Paul Ebert said he does not let a defendant's immigration status affect how he pursues a case but said, "to the extent that he and others come here to enjoy the milk and honey of this country, and then thumb their noses at our laws, it bothers me."\par \par \uc2 Martinelly came to the U.S. with his family from Bolivia when he was 9. He was facing deportation proceedings at the time of the Aug. 1, 2010 crash. But his lawyers said Monday that he had a work permit at the time, and they disputed the accuracy of calling him an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 One of the lawyers, Melissa Sanchez, said an appeal of the murder conviction is likely.\par \par \uc2 He will be sentenced in February. He faces up to 70 years in prison.

Councilmember is preparing to announce what he calls a "new, very aggressive" push to make the nation's capital a state.\par \par \uc2 Councilmember Michael Brown will detail his plans this week. Brown's office says the strategy involves asking state and local legislatures around the country to pass ceremonial resolutions supporting district statehood.\par \par \uc2 A similar resolution was introduced in the New Hampshire legislature this year after a push from Councilmember David Catania. Statehood supporters say it's important to build a coalition of support around the country.\par \par \uc2 In 1978, Congress approved a Constitutional amendment that would have given the District of Columbia full representation in the House and Senate.

The restrictions begin at 4 p.m. and will last until 6 a.m. Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 Many side streets also will be closed to through traffic beginning at 6:30 p.m. on Monday through 3 a.m. on Tuesday morning.

Spokeswoman Courtney O'Donnell says the family is "thrilled" by the news.\par \par \uc2 Ashley Biden is a 30-year-old social worker. Her fiance, Dr. Howard Krein, is a Philadelphia-based physician who specializes in ear, nose and throat and in facial and reconstructive surgery.\par \par \uc2 The couple became engaged in September after dating for about a year, and word began to leak after the vice president referred several times to his "future son-in-law" at an event in Wilmington, Del., on Friday.\par \par \uc2 Joe Biden also has two sons from his first marriage.

(AP) -- A judge has found an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Bolivia who was in a car crash that killed a Catholic nun in Prince William County guilty of felony murder.\par \par \uc2 The trial began Monday for Carlos Martinelly Montano. Prosecutors say he was drunk and caused the fatal crash in Bristow that killed Benedictine Sister Denise Mosier and injured two other nuns.\par \par \uc2 The judge ruled Monday afternoon that driving under the influence has consequences that are foreseeable and therefore meet the standard for murder.\par \par \uc2 Before the trial began, Martinelly Montano pleaded guilty to lesser charges, including involuntary manslaughter and maiming while driving drunk. He pleaded not guilty to felony murder. He had requested a bench trial.\par \par \uc2 Martinelly Montano had twice before been convicted of drunken driving but was released from custody while awaiting deportation.\par \par \uc2 UNION STATION REPAIRS\par \par \uc2 Union Station's main hall reopens after repairs\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) -- The main hall of Union Station in Washington has reopened after repairs were made to a ceiling damaged by the 5.8-magnitude quake in August.\par \par \uc2 The hall reopened on Sunday afternoon. It had been closed since Friday evening after officials said a small piece of plaster fell from the ceiling.\par \par \uc2 Crews have hung netting to prevent any more plaster from falling until the ceiling restoration is completed. That work is scheduled to begin this week.\par \par \uc2 LAUREL MALL DEMOLITION\par \par \uc2 Laurel Mall to be demolished for new town center\par \par \uc2 LAUREL, Md.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) - A Unitarian church in New Mexico sends supplies to the border for recent deportees. A coalition of church leaders gathers under a statue of colonial America religious figure Anne Hutchinson at the Massachusetts Statehouse to denounce immigration checks by police. A Methodist minister in Texas recites Isaiah 58:6, a passage about loosening the bonds of injustice, as she's thrown in jail after protesting alongside \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students outside a U.S. senator's office.\par \par \uc2 As some states pass laws aimed at cracking down on illegal immigration and federal lawmakers balk at passing any immigration reforms, religious leaders from various denominations are jumping into the debate. They're holding rallies, walking in the Arizona desert, gathering testimonies from immigrants. The leaders fast, get arrested, and sometimes put their own health on the line in an attempt to draw attention to what they see as inhumane treatment of immigrants and to the laws that target them.\par \par \uc2 "Some of us feel very strongly about this," said Rev. Peter Morales, president of the Unitarian Universalist Association, who was arrested last year with immigrant advocates in Arizona for protesting Arizona's much debated, tough immigration law. "It's a humanitarian issue."\par \par \uc2 From New York to Utah and across denominations, religious leaders have used their positions from the pulpit in an effort to influence legislation or rally church members in protest. Earlier this year, for example, more than 20 religious leaders and officials with church-operated charities in Alabama spoke out against a stringent new anti-immigration law that they said would block them from providing food, shelter and transportation to the poor.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, the Rev. Angela Herrera, an assistant minister with the First Unitarian Church of Albuquerque, helped organized her members and other religious leader in successful rallies against an effort by New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez to overturn a state law allowing illegal immigrants to obtain drivers' licenses.\par \par \uc2 And last year, St. Leo's Catholic Church in Queens, N.Y. sent Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., testimonies from more than 230 people asking for immigration reform. It was one of many Catholic churches around the country that pushed immigration reform.\par \par \uc2 "Immigration is a God event." said Rev. Lorenza Andrade Smith, the United Methodist pastor who was arrested outside of the offices of Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchinson, R-Texas.\par \par \uc2 Many religious leaders point to immigration stories in the Bible as personal reflections that influence their calling to push immigration reform.\par \par \uc2 Christopher C. Hope, the reach-out now director of Pentecostal Tabernacle, a church located between Harvard and MIT in Cambridge, Mass., said he often points out that Jesus and his family had to emigrate to Egypt from Israel to avoid death by King Herod, and God ordered the Israelites that "the stranger who sojourns with you shall be to you as the native among you."\par \par \uc2 There's also a practical reason for churches to embrace immigrants and immigration reform: the influx has helped revive some churches.\par \par \uc2 Bishop Brian Greene, senior pastor of Pentecostal Tabernacle, saw his church grow from less than 50 members to close to 400 in 10 years after the church began recruiting immigrant students and scholars. The sojourner is a hot topic, he said.\par \par \uc2 Hope said the church helped convince the city of Cambridge and some Massachusetts schools and colleges to publicly support the DREAM act -- a stalled federal proposal that would allow \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students a pathway to citizenship through college and military service.\par \par \uc2 But Greene said the church has to be careful since many of his members are legal immigrants who have gone through a long process to stay in the country, and they are now living apart from their families. He doesn't want to advocate too much on one side of an issue and risk alienating some members. "It's important to listen to both sides," he said.\par \par \uc2 Still, some advocates for tougher immigration restrictions say that the views of some religious leaders may run counter to those held by members of their congregations. They point to a 2009 Zogby poll that found that 64 percent of mainline Protestants support enforcement measures that encouraged illegal immigrants to return to their native countries, while only 24 percent support conditional legalization.\par \par \uc2 Smith said that shouldn't matter.\par \par \uc2 "Just because you're in the majority doesn't make it right," said Smith, who recently shared her work among immigrants with a group of United Methodists at an Albuquerque conference. "There are laws but there are also laws that are unjust. I'm trying to communicate the love of God. So if I see that a law is not communicating the love of God, I will speak out."\par \par \uc2 Greene said the public popularity of any political stance doesn't mean it triumphs God's word. "To me, it's about, what does the word say'?" he said.\par \par \uc2 During a recent church service at the First Unitarian Church of Albuquerque, member Kristine Olson, 59, hosted a table with books on the borderlands and collected supplies for immigrants who had recently been deported. Olson said she and other members were planning a trip to Mexico to personally give hygiene products to the immigrants who had been separated from family. "Our way of worship is through service," she said.\par \par \uc2 Smith said it's important to meet church members where they are in their faith and not push too hard.\par \par \uc2 "But I am called to do this," said Smith. "And I have to be obedient to God's call."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020111029e7at002ut\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SEATTLE (AP) - The U.S. Border Patrol has quietly stopped its controversial practice of routinely searching buses, trains and airports for illegal immigrants at transportation hubs along the northern border and in the nation's interior, preventing agents from using what had long been an effective tool for tracking down people here illegally, The Associated Press has learned.\par \par \uc2 Current and former Border Patrol agents said field offices around the country began receiving the order last month -- soon after the Obama administration announced that to ease an overburdened immigration system, it would allow many illegal immigrants to remain in the country while it focuses on deporting those who have committed crimes.\par \par \uc2 The routine bus, train and airport checks typically involved agents milling about and questioning people who appeared suspicious, and had long been criticized by immigrant rights groups. Critics said the tactic amounted to racial profiling and violated travelers' civil liberties.\par \par \uc2 But agents said it was an effective way to catch unlawful immigrants, including smugglers and possible terrorists, who had evaded detection at the border, as well as people who had overstayed their visas. Often, those who evade initial detection head quickly for the nearest public transportation in hopes of reaching other parts of the country.\par \par \uc2 Halting the practice has baffled the agents, especially in some stations along the northern border -- from Bellingham, Wash., to Houlton, Maine -- where the so-called "transportation checks" have been the bulk of their everyday duties. The Border Patrol is authorized to check vehicles within 100 miles of the border.\par \par \uc2 The order has not been made public, but two agents described it to the AP on condition of because the government does not authorize them to speak to the media. The union that represents Border Patrol agents planned to issue a news release about the change Monday.\par \par \uc2 "Orders have been sent out from Border Patrol headquarters in Washington, D.C., to Border Patrol sectors nationwide that checks of transportation hubs and systems located away from the southwest border of the United States will only be conducted if there is intelligence indicating a threat," the release says.\par \par \uc2 Those who have received the orders said agents may still go to train and bus stations and airports if they have specific "actionable intelligence" that there is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  there who recently entered the country. An agent in Washington state said it's not clear how agents are supposed to glean such intelligence, and even if they did, under the new directive they still require clearance from Washington, D.C., headquarters before they can respond.\par \par \uc2 A U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesman, Bill Brooks, repeatedly insisted that any shift in enforcement tactics does not amount to a change in policy as local commanders still have authority to aggressively pursue illegal immigrants near the border and at transportation hubs.\par \par \uc2 "It's up to the local commander to position his agents the way he wants to position them. What we've done is gone to a risk-based posture," he said.\par \par \uc2 In a separate statement, the agency said, "Conducting intelligence-based transportation checks allows the Border Patrol to use their technology and personnel resources more effectively, especially in areas with limited resources."\par \par \uc2 Shawn Moran, vice president of the union that represents agents, was outraged at the changes.\par \par \uc2 "Stated plainly, Border Patrol managers are increasing the layers of bureaucracy and making it as difficult as possible for Border Patrol agents to conduct their core duties," the National Border Patrol Council's statement said. "The only risks being managed by this move are too many apprehensions, negative media attention and complaints generated by immigrant rights groups."\par \par \uc2 The Border Patrol, which patrols outside the official ports of entry handled by customs officers, has dramatically beefed up its staffing since 9/11, doubling to more than 20,000 agents nationally. Along the northern border, the number has jumped from about 300 in the late 1990s to more than 2,200.\par \par \uc2 At the same time, the number of Border Patrol arrests nationwide has been falling -- from nearly 1.2 million in 2005 to 463,000 in 2010, and 97 percent of them at the southern border, according to the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Immigration Statistics. The office cited the recession as a likely factor in the drop.\par \par \uc2 Along the northern border last fiscal year, the agency made 7,431 arrests. It was not immediately clear how many stemmed from routine transportation checks. The public affairs office for the Border Patrol's Blaine sector said it doesn't break down the data that way.\par \par \uc2 But of 673 arrests in the sector, roughly 200 were from routine transportation checks, according to a Washington state-based Border Patrol agent who has been with the agency for more than 20 years and spoke to the AP.\par \par \uc2 Until receiving the new directive, the Bellingham office, about 25 miles from the Canadian border, kept agents at the bus and train station, and at the local airport 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Now, the agents have little work to do, the agent said.\par \par \uc2 The situation is similar in upstate New York, where an agent told the AP -- also on the condition of anonymity -- that a senior manager relayed the new directive during a morning roll call last month. Since then, instead of checking buses or trains, agents have spent shifts sitting in their vehicles gazing out at Lake Erie and Lake Ontario, where few illegal immigrants cross.\par \par \uc2 "They're already bored," the agent said. "You grab the paper every day and you go do the crossword."\par \par \uc2 In the Buffalo sector, where there were more than 2,400 arrests in fiscal 2010, as many as half were from routine transportation checks, the agent estimated.\par \par \uc2 The change was immediately obvious to Jack Barker, who manages the Greyhound and Trailways bus station in Rochester, N.Y. For the past six years, he said, Border Patrol agents boarded nearly every bus in and out of the station looking for illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Last month -- one day after the 10th anniversary of 9/11 and all of the hype that surrounded it -- the agents stopped coming. They haven't been back since, Barker said.\par \par \uc2 "What's changed that they're no longer needed here?" Barker asked. "I haven't been able to get an answer from anybody."\par \par \uc2 Doug Honig, spokesman for the American Civil Liberties Union of Washington, welcomed the news.\par \par \uc2 "If the Border Patrol is indeed not boarding buses and trains and engaging in the random questioning of people, that's a step in the right direction," he said. "People shouldn't be questioned by government officials when there's no reason to believe they've done anything wrong."\par \par \uc2 Kent Lundgren, chairman of the National Association of Former Border Patrol Officers, said the transportation checks have been a staple of the agency for 60 years. His organization has heard from agents around the country complaining of the change, he said.\par \par \uc2 Gene Davis, a retired deputy chief in the Border Patrol's sector in Blaine, Wash., emphasized how effective the checks can be. He noted that a check of the Bellingham bus station in 1997 yielded an arrest of Palestinian Gazi Ibrahim Abu Mezer. Abu Mezer skipped out on a $5,000 bond -- only to turn up later in Brooklyn, where New York police shot him as he prepared to bomb the city's subway system. Davis also noted that would-be millennium bomb suspect Ahmed Ressam was arrested at the border in late 1999 when he left a ferry from British Columbia to Washington in a rented car full of explosives.\par \par \uc2 "We've had two terrorists who have come through the northern border here. To put these restraints on agents being able to talk to people is just ridiculous," Davis said. "Abu Mezer got out, but that just shows you the potential that's there with the transportation checks."\par \par \uc2 The Border Patrol informed officials at the Bellingham airport on Thursday that from now on they would only be allowed to come to the airport "if there's an action that needs their assistance," said airport manager Daniel Zenk.\par \par \uc2 "I'm shocked," Zenk said. "We welcome the security presence the Border Patrol provides."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Contributing to this report were Associated Press writers Alicia Caldwell in Washington, D.C., Manuel Valdes in Seattle, Ben Dobbin in Rochester, N.Y., and Carolyn Thompson from Buffalo, N.Y.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Johnson can be reached at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://twitter.com/GeneAPseattle"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://twitter.com/GeneAPseattle}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020111029e7at0001b\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SEATTLE (AP) - The U.S. Border Patrol has quietly stopped its controversial practice of routinely searching buses, trains and airports for illegal immigrants at transportation hubs along the northern border and in the nation's interior, preventing agents from using what had long been an effective tool for tracking down people here illegally, The Associated Press has learned.\par \par \uc2 Current and former Border Patrol agents said field offices around the country began receiving the order last month -- soon after the Obama administration announced that to ease an overburdened immigration system, it would allow many undocumented people to remain in the country while it focuses on deporting those who have committed crimes.\par \par \uc2 The routine bus, train and airport checks typically involved agents milling about and questioning people who appeared suspicious, and had long been criticized by immigrant rights groups. Critics said the tactic amounted to racial profiling and violated the civil liberties of travelers.\par \par \uc2 But agents said it was an effective way to catch unlawful immigrants, including smugglers and possible terrorists, who had evaded detection at the border, as well as people who had overstayed their visas. Often, those who evade detection head quickly for the nearest mass public transportation in hopes of reaching other parts of the country.\par \par \uc2 Halting the practice has baffled the agents, especially in some stations along the northern border -- from Bellingham, Wash., to Houlton, Maine -- where the so-called "transportation checks" have been the bulk of their everyday duties. The Border Patrol is authorized to check vehicles within 100 miles of the border.\par \par \uc2 The order has not been made public, but two agents described it to the AP on condition of anonymity because the government does not authorize them to speak to the media. The union that represents Border Patrol agents planned to issue a press release about the change Monday.\par \par \uc2 "Orders have been sent out from Border Patrol headquarters in Washington, D.C., to Border Patrol sectors nationwide that checks of transportation hubs and systems located away from the southwest border of the United States will only be conducted if there is intelligence indicating a threat," the release says.\par \par \uc2 Those who have received the orders said, agents may still go to train and bus stations and airports if they have specific "actionable intelligence" that there is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  there who recently entered the country. An agent in Washington state said it's not clear how agents are supposed to glean such intelligence, and even if they did, under the new directive they still require clearance from Washington, D.C., headquarters before they can respond.\par \par \uc2 A U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesman, Bill Brooks, repeatedly insisted that any shift in enforcement tactics does not amount to a change in policy as local commanders still have authority to aggressively pursue illegal immigrants near the border and at transportation hubs.\par \par \uc2 "It's up to the local commander to position his agents the way he wants to position them. What we've done is gone to a risk-based posture," he said.\par \par \uc2 In a separate statement, the agency said, "Conducting intelligence-based transportation checks allows the Border Patrol to use their technology and personnel resources more effectively, especially in areas with limited resources."\par \par \uc2 Shawn Moran, vice president of the union that represents agents, was outraged at the changes.\par \par \uc2 "Stated plainly, Border Patrol managers are increasing the layers of bureaucracy and making it as difficult as possible for Border Patrol agents to conduct their core duties," the National Border Patrol Council's statement said. "The only risks being managed by this move are too many apprehensions, negative media attention and complaints generated by immigrant rights groups."\par \par \uc2 The Border Patrol has dramatically beefed up its staffing in the decade since Sept. 11, 2001, doubling to more than 20,000 agents nationally. Along the northern border, the number has jumped from about 300 in the late 1990s to more than 2,200.\par \par \uc2 Until receiving the new directive, the Bellingham office, about 25 miles from the Canadian border, kept agents at the bus-and-train station and at the local airport 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Now, the agents have little work to do, according to a Washington state-based Border Patrol agent who has been with the agency for more than 20 years and spoke to the AP.\par \par \uc2 The situation is similar in upstate New York, where an agent told the AP -- also on the condition of anonymity -- that a senior manager relayed the new directive during a morning roll call last month. Since then, instead of checking buses or trains, agents have spent shifts sitting in their vehicles gazing out at Lake Erie and Lake Ontario, where few illegal immigrants cross.\par \par \uc2 "They're already bored," the agent said. "You grab the paper every day and you go do the crossword."\par \par \uc2 The change was immediately obvious to Jack Barker, who manages the Greyhound and Trailways bus station in Rochester, N.Y. For the past six years, he said, Border Patrol agents boarded nearly every bus in and out of the station looking for illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Last month -- one day after the 10th anniversary of Sept. 11 and all of the hype that surrounded it -- the agents stopped coming. They haven't been back since, Barker said.\par \par \uc2 "What's changed that they're no longer needed here?" Barker asked. "I haven't been able to get an answer from anybody."\par \par \uc2 Doug Honig, spokesman for the American Civil Liberties Union of Washington, welcomed the news.\par \par \uc2 "If the Border Patrol is indeed not boarding buses and trains and engaging in the random questioning of people, that's a step in the right direction," he said. "People shouldn't be questioned by government officials when there's no reason to believe they've done anything wrong."\par \par \uc2 Kent Lundgren, chairman of the National Association of Former Border Patrol Officers, said the transportation checks have been a staple of the agency for 60 years. His organization has heard from agents around the country complaining of the change, he said.\par \par \uc2 "From the tactical point of view, the Border Patrol is no longer checking transportation unless there's a specific threat," he said.\par \par \uc2 Gene Davis, a retired deputy chief in the Border Patrol's sector in Blaine, Wash., emphasized how effective the checks can be. He noted that a check of the Bellingham bus station in 1997 yielded an arrest of Palestinian Gazi Ibrahim Abu Mezer. Abu Mezer skipped out on a $5,000 bond -- only to turn up later in Brooklyn, where New York police shot him as he prepared to bomb the city's subway system. Davis also noted that would be millennium bomb suspect Ahmed Ressam was arrested at the border in late 1999 when he drove off a ferry from British Columbia to Washington in a rented car full of explosives.\par \par \uc2 "We've had two terrorists who have come through the northern border here -- to put these restraints on agents being able to talk to people is just ridiculous," Davis said. "Abu Mezer got out, but that just shows you the potential that's there with the transportation checks."\par \par \uc2 The Border Patrol informed officials at the Bellingham airport on Thursday that from now on they would only be allowed to come to the airport "if there's an action that needs their assistance," said airport manager Daniel Zenk.\par \par \uc2 "I'm shocked," Zenk said. "We welcome the security presence the Border Patrol provides."\par \par \uc2 ------(equals)\par \par \uc2 Alicia Caldwell contributed from Washington, D.C., Ben Dobbin from Rochester, N.Y., and Carolyn Thompson from Buffalo, N.Y.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Johnson can be reached at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://twitter.com/GeneAPseattle"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://twitter.com/GeneAPseattle}}}\par \par \uc2 5\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020111028e7as002qy\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 LANSING, Mich. (AP) - Michigan had the nation's costliest state court races in the 2010 election cycle, with most of the money coming from outside groups that paid for a flurry of negative campaign ads, according to a report released Thursday by a judicial watchdog group.\par \par \uc2 The Michigan Supreme Court race accounted for a quarter of the $38.4 million spent nationally in 2009-10, according to the report prepared by the Justice at Stake Campaign, the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law and the National Institute of Money in State Politics.\par \par \uc2 Because Michigan doesn't require outside groups to disclose what they're spending on TV ads, the court race could have cost as much as $11.1 million, it said.\par \par \uc2 Besides having the highest amount of spending, Michigan also was cited for having the highest total TV spending and the largest number of negative ads aired.\par \par \uc2 "More than ever, a small number of super-spenders played a dominant role in influencing who sits on state supreme courts. Much of this influence was exercised secretly," the report said.\par \par \uc2 Following Michigan in spending was Pennsylvania, where judicial candidates spent $5.4 million and no outside money was involved, and Ohio, where candidates and outside groups spent a combined $4.4 million.\par \par \uc2 Alabama, Illinois, Texas, Arkansas, Wisconsin, Louisiana and Iowa rounded out the top 10.\par \par \uc2 The most visible state races may have been in Iowa, where spending hit $1.4 million, 10th highest nationally. Groups opposed to gay marriage spent an estimated $1 million campaigning to get three Iowa justices removed after they the high court unanimously upheld a lower court ruling that a state ban on same-sex marriage violated the constitutional rights of equal protection. Three justices lost retention elections, and the groups have vowed to pursue the same campaign against the justices who remain on the court.\par \par \uc2 Slightly less than half of the 50 states elect Supreme Court justices, although others hold retention elections for appointed justices. Michigan's high court candidates are nominated by political parties but run on a nonpartisan part of the ballot.\par \par \uc2 The 2010 race in Michigan was pivotal, returning the court to a 4-3 GOP majority just a few months after Democrats took a 4-3 edge when a Democrat was appointed to fill a vacancy.\par \par \uc2 It also was bitterly fought, with TV ads trying to portray GOP Justice Robert Young Jr. as a judge who favored big polluters, especially the company responsible for a major oil spill in the Kalamazoo River. In the campaign's home stretch, former Justice Elizabeth Weaver -- a Republican who had warred with Young while on the court -- stepped forward and accused him of using a racial slur during private conferences with other justices in 2006.\par \par \uc2 Young, who is black, acknowledged using the word but said he was quoting a disgraced former judge who had lost her job because of it. Republican candidate Mary Beth Kelly, too, was hit with a TV ad accusing her of failing to lock up an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who was subsequently convicted of kidnapping and killing a Detroit-area man. An outside group joined the fray, running an ad that suggested Democratic challenger Denise Langford Morris was "soft on crime" for "rappers, lawyers and child pornographers."\par \par \uc2 The Michigan Republican Party spent $4.1 million to $4.8 million on the race, largely on ads promoting Young and Kelly, while the Michigan Democratic Party spent $1.5 million to $2.5 million. The report estimates outside groups spent $1.3 million on the race, with most of that -- $800,000 to $1.2 million -- spent on TV ads by the Law Enforcement Alliance of America, which ran the anti-Morris ads and has ties to the National Rifle Association.\par \par \uc2 The political parties and outside groups spent more than four times as much money on TV ads as the Michigan candidates themselves, the report said. Yet while the candidates had to disclose who was giving them money, the report says voters were left in the dark over who was donating to the race through political parties or special-interest groups and what they were spending on ads.\par \par \uc2 "The fact that Michigan led the nation in undisclosed spending in a state judicial campaign is a distinction of dishonor," said Rich Robinson, executive director of the nonpartisan Michigan Campaign Finance Network, which has tried unsuccessfully to strengthen the state's disclosure laws.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Kathy Barks Hoffman can be reached at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://twitter.com/kathybhoffman"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://twitter.com/kathybhoffman}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020111027e7ar002ap\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc89}{\*\bkmkend toc89}\b \uc2 From cops on street to judges on bench, confusion reigns over Alabama immigration law\b0\par\par\uc2 By JAY REEVES   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 1,125 \uc2 words\par \uc2 26 October 2011\par 16:42\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2011.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) - Alabama's tough new law on illegal immigration was complicated even before the courts got involved. Now that federal judges have blocked parts of the act while letting others take effect, officials say uncertainty reigns even while suspects are being arrested and jailed.\par \par \uc2 Court cases can vary from one place to the other, depending on how local police apply the law to arrest suspects. Once those suspects get to court, the handling of their cases can vary from judge to judge in the state's more than 450 trial courts at the municipal and county level.\par \par \uc2 "There's a whole lot of confusion about the law and what we should do about it," said Judge Scott Vowell, a circuit judge in Birmingham's Jefferson County and president of the Alabama Circuit Judges Association.\par \par \uc2 He said he has a list of troubling reports: In some areas, police are setting up roadblocks near mobile home communities where Hispanic people live. One municipal judge opened court by saying that anyone without a driver's license would be arrested under the law. Another judge told spectators that the need for a translator could be considered evidence against someone.\par \par \uc2 Other cases of mixed signals are easy to find.\par \par \uc2 In the north Alabama city of Decatur, four people were arrested on charges of failing to have proper documents and pleaded guilty within hours under a part of the law a federal court has since struck down. The same day in Jemison, a judge threw out a similar charge against a man because the defendant already was free on bond from a federal immigration court.\par \par \uc2 Court administrators' interpretation of a key part of the law was challenged by a judge in one instance, and a lawyer tried and failed to use the month-old law to throw out a contract reached in May 2010 between a car seller and two purchasers who were living in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 Alabama's top law enforcement official, Attorney General Luther Strange, said many people who are uncertain about the law haven't even read it. While some say the federal court decisions added to the confusion, Strange said they may have instead helped by placing some sections on hold.\par \par \uc2 "I think it will give people a chance to take a breath and read the provisions," said Strange, whose office is defending the act in court.\par \par \uc2 State officials are trying to clear up some of the questions through training that began only after the law took effect. The Administrative Office of Courts has sent memos and emails to judges explaining the law, and the Alabama Department of Homeland Security provided an overview for police at a meeting organized by Strange's office.\par \par \uc2 On Friday, the Alabama District Attorneys Association will hold a meeting for prosecutors in hopes of developing a blueprint for statewide training for law enforcement. Executive director Randy Hillman said many local agencies still aren't enforcing the law because of uncertainty over exactly what it says.\par \par \uc2 "Right now people don't know how to apply it," Hillman said. "We're feeling our way. It's not that it's not doable, it's just that it's difficult."\par \par \uc2 Susan Fuqua, the head of a state organization for municipal court officials, said training sessions and legal advice from Montgomery help, but courts constantly disagree over how to enforce laws. Court rulings yet to come could complicate the situation even further, she said.\par \par \uc2 "There are over 170 municipal courts in Alabama. There are judges there, and they might be on different pages on how to handle it. Are they all in agreement? I can't answer that," said Fuqua, president of the Alabama Municipal Court Clerks and Magistrates Association.\par \par \uc2 Passed by the Republican-controlled Legislature and signed by GOP Gov. Robert Bentley, the 72-page, 34-section law is considered the nation's toughest crackdown on illegal immigration by both supporters and opponents. It covers a wide range of everyday life, from making it illegal to give an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  a ride and requiring schools to check students' citizenship status to barring contracts with illegal immigrants and making them carry documents.\par \par \uc2 The law originally was set to take effect Sept. 1, but U.S. District Judge Sharon Blackburn blocked implementation while considering challenges from the Justice Department, immigrant rights groups, religious leaders and others. She finally let some sections take effect on Sept. 29 but blocked others, and the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals then blocked more of it this month.\par \par \uc2 As lawyers sorted through the court opinions, some police agencies delayed enforcement. Fuqua said police haven't filed any cases in the municipal court she oversees in the Birmingham suburb of Hoover, but other cities already are prosecuting people.\par \par \uc2 The four illegal immigrants arrested in Decatur during a pair of traffic stops pleaded guilty on Oct. 10 within hours of their detention under a section of the law that created a misdemeanor offense for anyone who was in the country illegally and failed to carry an alien registration document.\par \par \uc2 Each was ordered to pay $296 in fines and fees and transferred to the custody of federal immigration officials, even though the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals blocked enforcement of that section of the law four days later.\par \par \uc2 Municipal court officials said none of the four appealed their convictions, but a defense attorney who represented them did not return messages seeking comment.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, a judge in the central town of Jemison was throwing out the case against a man who was arrested on a similar charge of failing to have documents. His lawyer, Freddy Rubio, argued that the law was unclear and his client was legally in the United States because he was free on bond while challenging a deportation order from a federal immigration judge.\par \par \uc2 Rubio, an American Civil Liberties Union board member who is part of the coalition challenging the new law, said he has spent years representing immigrant clients yet still isn't sure exactly which parts of the law are now in effect and exactly what they mean.\par \par \uc2 "It's a mess. It was so big, no one is sure what it is now," he said.\par \par \uc2 Vowell, the head of the judges' association, agrees.\par \par \uc2 "Judges need to make an effort to apply the law the same around the state, and that's certainly difficult because of the ambiguity of the law and the opinions that have been issued by the federal courts that have addressed the law," he said. "Some of it will just have to be addressed on a case-by-case basis."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020111026e7aq002ym\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - In upstate New York towns a short drive from the U.S.-Canadian border, federal agents, their numbers swelled by a post-Sept. 11 anti-terrorism strategy, have been a steady presence at train and bus stations and airports as they go about their duties securing the nation's boundaries.\par \par \uc2 Arrests are up in the busy sector that stretches 400 miles from the Ohio-Pennsylvania state line north through western and northern New York. But not because more people are trying to sneak into the country from Canada.\par \par \uc2 In a geographical twist, agents attached to the northern border and the 100-mile zone around it have in some instances become de facto southern border agents, frequently arresting people who have entered the country through Texas, New Mexico or Arizona some 2,000 miles away, according to agency statistics reviewed by The Associated Press.\par \par \uc2 "You're not going to find Mexicans coming in through Canada, generally," Border Patrol spokeswoman Kerry Rogers said.\par \par \uc2 The records, obtained through the Freedom of Information Act, show the Buffalo sector of the Border Patrol has become a perennial leader, among the eight segments that make up the 4,000-mile northern border, in the number of arrests of illegal immigrants from Mexico and Central America. In 2008, 1,618 Mexicans were among 3,339 total arrests, a high for the decade for the Buffalo sector, which has led in total \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  apprehensions each year since 2007.\par \par \uc2 Arrests by Detroit-based agents also comprise a high percentage of detained Mexicans, statistics show. In 2008, 664 of 961 total apprehensions involved Mexicans. The number jumped to 1,196 out of 1,669 arrests in 2010. In the Swanton, Vt., sector, only 157 of 1,422 people apprehended last year were from Mexico.\par \par \uc2 Some rural areas of upstate New York have seen a marked increase in the population of Mexican- and Central American-born residents, said Max Pfeffer, a Cornell University sociology professor and researcher who has examined immigration and farmworkers issues. But the increase is not as great as those seen in North Carolina and other Southern states, leading some to wonder what's behind the seemingly aggressive enforcement to the north.\par \par \uc2 "Relatively speaking, the concentration of immigrants in this area is relatively low," Pfeffer said. "Everyone's saying, `Why are (agents) so active here?' and I don't know the answer either."\par \par \uc2 One factor is the number of agents. Since the Sept. 11 attacks, the number of officers assigned to the northern border has increased more than 650 percent, from about 340 in 2001 to more than 2,200 agents today, CBP Commissioner Alan Bersin told senators in May.\par \par \uc2 And in a December report, the government said the U.S.-Canada boundary poses a more significant terrorist threat than the southern border because of the expanse and limited law enforcement coverage. Last year, the U.S. spent $2.9 billion securing the northern border.\par \par \uc2 But critics say border agents, whose main job is to protect the country from terrorism, have no business asking passengers for proof of citizenship on trains and buses on routes that don't cross the northern border, even if they are within their agency's 100-mile coverage area.\par \par \uc2 "Their mission involves securing the border and they're treating their mission as just doing whatever they want within 100 miles of the border and often beyond that," said Nancy Morowetz, a clinical law professor at New York University.\par \par \uc2 The Border Patrol say it deploys people based on risk and threats posed along the border and that transportation checks, based on intelligence, allow the agency to use staff more effectively, especially in areas with limited resources. Smugglers, the agency said, are known to use trains and buses to move people and drugs deeper into the country.\par \par \uc2 Court documents indicate \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  cases frequently begin when Border Patrol agents are called to help interpret at traffic stops or crime scenes. Each year since 1996, 107 to 149 cases have landed in U.S. District Court in Buffalo where defendants are federally charged because they were arrested after having been previously removed from the country, according to the district's U.S. attorney's office. Most have resulted in convictions.\par \par \uc2 A typical federal case is that of Eduardo Antonio Gonzalez-Valencia, a citizen of El Salvador who pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court in Rochester in July and was ordered deported.\par \par \uc2 Gonzalez-Valencia was arrested May 21 on a train at the Amtrak station in Rochester. According to court documents, a uniformed Border Patrol agent was performing transportation checks on the train and talking to passengers in what's described as a "consensual, non-intrusive" manner. Gonzalez-Valencia produced an El Salvador passport and "freely stated that he was illegally present in the United States and without the proper immigration documentation," the agent wrote in an affidavit.\par \par \uc2 He was arrested and a fingerprint check revealed he'd been arrested at Miami International Airport in 2002 with false documents and immediately returned to El Salvador. It's unclear where he entered the country the second time; federal prosecutors don't track point of entry.\par \par \uc2 During a recent visit to Buffalo, the head of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration said the government is balancing the need to welcome and serve those in the country legally while protecting the nation.\par \par \uc2 "Those different responsibilities are not exclusive of one another," Alejandro Mayorkas said.\par \par \uc2 Given the numbers of Mexicans and Central Americans arrested in a region that relies heavily on migrant workers for its fruit and vegetable farms, there's concern the high numbers of arrests are negatively affecting even legal workers and permanent residents.\par \par \uc2 "The active enforcement puts a real chill in communities, especially how much immigrants are involved in communities," said Pfeffer. "A lot of people are staying out of sight because they're fearful even just of being stopped by the authorities, whether they have anything to hide or not."\par \par \uc2 That chilling effect isn't unique to New York.\par \par \uc2 Employers say Alabama's strict new immigration law has driven away construction workers, roofers and field hands in the country legally, either because family members don't have the proper papers or because of a hostile atmosphere.\par \par \uc2 An appeals court this month blocked parts of the law, preventing Alabama from checking the immigration status of students and police from charging immigrants who are unable to prove their citizenship.\par \par \uc2 For Morowetz, it doesn't matter whether those questioned are from Mexico or Poland or China, she said.\par \par \uc2 "There's still the question of where did they come into the country. Did they come across the northern border?" she said. "That's really the central question because if people are not coming across the border, what you really have is the Border Patrol in upstate New York engaging in interior enforcement of immigration law."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020111023e7an003ev\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) - It was just another schoolyard basketball game until a group of Hispanic seventh-graders defeated a group of boys from Alabama.\par \par \uc2 The reaction was immediate, according to the Mexican mother of one of the winners, and rooted in the state's new law on illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 "They told them, `You shouldn't be winning. You should go back to Mexico,'" said the woman, who spoke through a translator last week and didn't want her name used. She and her son are in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 Spanish-speaking parents say their children are facing more bullying and taunts at school since Alabama's tough crackdown on illegal immigration took effect last month. Many blame the name-calling on fallout from the law, which has been widely covered in the news, discussed in some classrooms and debated around dinner tables.\par \par \uc2 Justice Department officials are monitoring for bullying incidents linked to the law.\par \par \uc2 "We're hearing a number of reports about increases in bullying that we're studying," the head of the agency's civil rights division, Thomas Perez, said during a stop in Birmingham.\par \par \uc2 The Justice Department has established a bilingual telephone hotline and special email account for residents to report any violence or threats based on racial or ethnic background that could be linked to the law. Officials would not provide a breakdown on the types of complaints being received.\par \par \uc2 Yet the Alabama Department of Education hasn't received any reports of bullying linked to the law, said spokeswoman Malissa Valdes, and it isn't tracking the issue to determine whether there could be a problem. Any parents who call the state with complaints would be referred to their child's principal, she said.\par \par \uc2 Federal officials say some parents -- particularly illegal immigrants -- may not report bullying to teachers and principals because they fear coming into contact with government officials.\par \par \uc2 Supporters of the law -- which is being challenged by the Obama administration, individuals and private groups -- contend it's vital to reducing the cost of state and local government by getting illegal immigrants off public assistance. They also argue the measure will create jobs for legal residents by opening up positions that had been held by people living in the country illegally. However, Americans so far have shown little interest in the backbreaking, low-paying jobs at farms and poultry factories that were usually held by illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Opponents contend the law is creating a climate of fear and mistrust in the state that's unsettling for immigrants who are both legal and illegal. Immigrants tell of dirty looks in grocery stores, and online forums are full of angry, anonymous comments and from both supporters and opponents of the law.\par \par \uc2 Machine shop manager Hector Conde said his family has seen the problem firsthand. Conde, whose family lives in Autauga County north of Montgomery, was appalled when his 12-year-old daughter, Monica Torres, told him a schoolmate called her a "damn Mexican" during a school bus ride.\par \par \uc2 "She is a citizen. She doesn't even speak Spanish," said Conde, a U.S. citizen originally from Puerto Rico. "The culture being created (by the law) is that this sort of thing is OK."\par \par \uc2 A Hispanic woman said her 13-year-old niece was called a "stupid Mexican" and told to "go back to Mexico" by a classmate in Walker County.\par \par \uc2 "She said, `If you're not going I'm going to punch you,'" said the woman, who spoke through a translator and didn't want her name used.\par \par \uc2 Courts have struck down sections of the law, including a provision that required public schools to verify the citizenship status of students. Other parts remain in effect, including a part that lets police check a person's immigration status during a traffic stop. Courts also can't enforce contracts involving illegal immigrants, such as leases, and it's still a felony for an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  to do business with the state for basic things like getting a driver's license.\par \par \uc2 In Shelby County, where hundreds of Hispanic children are enrolled in schools in Birmingham's southern suburbs, officials say they've had few reports of conflicts between Hispanic students and others.\par \par \uc2 "That isn't to say that it hasn't happened, but if it has they haven't been reporting it to school officials," said Cindy Warner, a spokeswoman for the system.\par \par \uc2 U.S. Attorney Joyce Vance, the lead federal prosecutor for north Alabama, said many Hispanic parents may be afraid to report bullying for fear of coming in contact with government officials. Under the law, authorities are supposed to detain suspected illegal immigrants found living in the state and hold them for federal immigration authorities.\par \par \uc2 Parents may be afraid to go to even school teachers and principals, she said. "It seems likely to me that people are trying to keep their heads down and stay out of trouble," said Vance.\par \par \uc2 Charles Warren is school superintendent DeKalb County, where about 18 percent of the 8,900 students enrolled in public schools are Hispanic. He doesn't see much tension between Hispanic students and others -- Crossville High School has had a Hispanic homecoming queen the last two years, he said.\par \par \uc2 "The kids get along great, it's the adults who are the problem," Warren said. "There are a lot of similarities to what went on back in the `50s and `60s with the civil rights movement. A lot of people are out of work now and they want to blame someone. I think the Hispanic people are catching a lot of that."\par \par \uc2 Warren is right about at least one thing: The taunting extends to the grown-up world. Supporters of the law have filled Steve Dubrinsky's email account with critical messages and peppered online message boards with negative reviews of his popular restaurant, Max's Delicatessen, after a talk radio show mistakenly said he employs illegal immigrants at his business in suburban Birmingham.\par \par \uc2 Dubrinsky's wife is a legal immigrant from Mexico, and he said all nine of his immigrant workers have proper papers. But he is still worried about the future of his business amid the onslaught.\par \par \uc2 "I've never experienced anything like this before," said Dubrinsky. "Those reviews were just plain and simple out to get me over this."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020111022e7am002pz\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 MEXICO CITY (AP) - Mexican President Felipe Calderon accused the United States on Thursday of dumping criminals at the border because it is cheaper than prosecuting them, and said the practice has fueled violence in Mexico's border areas.\par \par \uc2 U.S. officials earlier this week reported a record number of deportations in fiscal year 2011, and said the number of deportees with criminal convictions had nearly doubled since 2008.\par \par \uc2 "There are many factors in the violence that is being experienced in some Mexican border cities, but one of those is that the American authorities have gotten into the habit of simply deporting 60 (thousand) or 70,000 migrants per year to cities like Ciudad Juarez or Tijuana," Calderon told an immigration conference.\par \par \uc2 Among these deportees "there are many who really are criminals, who have committed some crime and it is simply cheaper to leave them on the Mexican side of the border than to prosecute them, as they should do, to see whether they are guilty or not," Calderon said. "And obviously, they quickly link up with criminal networks on the border."\par \par \uc2 On Tuesday, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director John Morton said his agency deported nearly 400,000 individuals during the fiscal year that ended in September, the largest number of removals in the agency's history.\par \par \uc2 Morton announced the 2011 numbers in Washington, saying about 55 percent of those deported had felony or misdemeanor convictions. Officials said the number of those convicted of crimes was up 89 percent from 2008. The vast majority of migrants, and deportees, are from Mexico.\par \par \uc2 There are no records to substantiate whether U.S. authorities opt for deporting undocumented Mexican nationals who have committed crimes instead of prosecuting them in the U.S.\par \par \uc2 The U.S. embassy declined to comment on Calderon's speech.\par \par \uc2 When Mexicans without documents finish their prison terms in the United States, they're bused to the border and freed. Mexican officials in Tijuana have said some deportees turn to petty crime but couldn't say if they were feeding drug cartels.\par \par \uc2 The Associated Press in the past year has repeatedly asked the Mexican government to document the impact of leaving deportees with criminal records at the border. The AP filed a freedom of information request asking Mexico's Foreign Ministry how many times the U.S. had notified Mexico it was deporting a convicted criminal and how many people arrested for drug trafficking in Mexico had prior records in the U.S. The foreign ministry said it didn't have such numbers. The office of Calderon's former security spokesman Alejandro Poire did not respond to similar queries.\par \par \uc2 The United States and Mexico are experimenting with new methods of alerting Mexico about deportations, and U.S. officials say they warn Mexico when former inmates are considered particularly dangerous.\par \par \uc2 Mexicans with criminal records in the U.S. can't be detained in Mexico if they have not violated the law in their home country, and some Mexican border cities complain they don't have any easy way to run criminal background checks on deported inmates to see if they have pending charges.\par \par \uc2 One deported criminal, Martin Estrada Luna, is accused of becoming a leader of a cell of the Zetas drug cartel in the border state of Tamaulipas just 18 months after he was deported from the United States. Estrada, who had a long rap sheet of mostly theft and property crimes in Washington state, is now in custody in Mexico City, where he is accused for masterminding the killing of more than 250 people.\par \par \uc2 Calderon also lashed out at what he called "absurd" and "irrational" immigration laws in the United States.\par \par \uc2 "To the extent to which they continue to put absurd curbs on migration, to the degree to which they continue to persecute migrants in the United States in an irrational way that sometimes violates their human rights, in that measure American society will continue to lose competitiveness..." he said.\par \par \uc2 That was an apparent reference to tough immigration laws like the one implemented in Alabama in late September. While courts have blocked some provisions of the law, judges let stand provisions that allow police to check a person's immigration status during a traffic stop.\par \par \uc2 Under the measure, courts also can't enforce contracts involving illegal immigrants, such as leases, and it is a felony for an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  to do business with the state for basic things like getting a driver's license.\par \par \uc2 Calderon said immigration shouldn't be seen as a threat or invasion; he noted that net migration of Mexicans to the United States is approaching zero, as fewer people leave and more come back.\par \par \uc2 Rafael Fernandez de Castro, head of the International Relations studies at the Monterrey Technological Institute, told the conference that about 200,000 Mexicans per year are returning to their country, and that Mexican schools are facing a new problem: tens of thousands of Mexican children are coming back each year with little or no Spanish.\par \par \uc2 "In the last couple of school years in Mexico, literally tens of thousands of children have turned up with last names like Sanchez, Fernandez, or Hinojosa and, it must be said, they don't speak Spanish, they speak English," Fernandez de Castro said. "We have to ask California and Texas how they managed to integrate these Mexican children who went to the United States and didn't speak English."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020111021e7al0000z\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 MIAMI (AP) - Caroline Roa was born in Florida, graduated from a Miami high school and has a state voter's registration card and driver's license. Yet when she went to enroll in college, she was told she would have to pay out-of-state tuition. The reason? Her father is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "I was always told that if I worked hard and did well in school I could get a scholarship to college," she said. "Instead of having the chance to succeed as other Florida residents have, my efforts were unfairly blocked."\par \par \uc2 The Southern Poverty Law Center filed a class action lawsuit Wednesday on behalf of Roa and four other students who were all born in the United States. In each case, their parent's immigration status meant they were classified as "non-residents" and charged a significantly higher tuition.\par \par \uc2 Roa is now working two jobs instead of going to college.\par \par \uc2 "This is not right or just and it isn't the America I know," she said.\par \par \uc2 The lawsuit was filed against Florida education officials and claims the policy discriminates against citizens and violates the Constitution. The Southern Poverty Law Center estimates hundreds of students are being overcharged and thousands more, like Roa, are unable to afford the out-of-state tuition and forgo a college education.\par \par \uc2 "This policy is hurting scores of young Floridians who are trying to go to college," said Miriam Haskell, a lead attorney for the Southern Poverty Law Center. "They want to be doctors, they want to be teachers, they want to provide for their families and support their community. And this is their community."\par \par \uc2 A spokeswoman for the state university system said they had not received a copy of the lawsuit and could not comment. The Board of Education did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\par \par \uc2 The Florida policy has been in place for several years, but the Southern Poverty Law Center said their class action lawsuit represents the first legal challenge.\par \par \uc2 California had a similar issue in which the citizen children of illegal immigrants were being charged as non-residents, but the matter was resolved in favor of the students through a consent decree. Similarly, in Colorado, the attorney general issued a formal opinion in 2007 determining that legal residents of the state were eligible for in-state tuition even if their parents were residing in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 "Because it is the student, rather than the parents, who is the legal beneficiary of in-state tuition status, the fact that the parents may be in the country illegally is not a bar to the student's receipt of that benefit," Attorney General John W. Suthers ruled in response to a question from the Colorado Department of Higher Education.\par \par \uc2 Jerri Katzerman, director of educational advocacy for the Southern Poverty Law Center, said a Virginia policy similar to the Florida one has been challenged successfully in favor of specific students.\par \par \uc2 Students who want to attend a Florida public college or university but are classified as "non-residents" because of their parents are charged more than triple the cost of tuition. The policy affects all students who are under the age of 24 and claimed as dependents by parents on their tax returns.\par \par \uc2 Roa was accepted to Miami Dade College this year, but soon found out she didn't qualify for in-state tuition, even though she had lived in Miami-Dade County her entire life. According to the lawsuit, Roa couldn't show proof of her father's legal immigration status and was therefore considered a non-resident.\par \par \uc2 She hopes to one day be able to afford college and study psychology.\par \par \uc2 Wendy Ruiz, another student named in the lawsuit, was born in Miami and is an honors student at Miami Dade College. Because she is charged as an out-of-state resident, she will need three years instead of two to complete her degree. The lawsuit states she attempted to apply to Florida International University, but was required to submit information on her parents' immigration status in order to file the application.\par \par \uc2 "My mother has always taught me that if I want something that bad to fight for it," said Ruiz, who wants to go to medical school. "All I want is to be treated the same as every other Florida college student."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020111019e7aj001sk\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) - Herman Cain's 9-9-9 tax plan ignited plenty of sparks in the Republican presidential debate Tuesday night, as did testy exchanges between Mitt Romney and Rick Perry. In those instances and more, the facts took a bit of a beating.\par \par \uc2 A look at the accuracy of some of the claims in the Las Vegas debate:\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 HERMAN CAIN: "It does not raise taxes on those that are making the least."\par \par \uc2 THE FACTS: An independent analysis of his tax plan, released Tuesday, concluded otherwise. The Tax Policy Center, a Washington think tank, said Cain's plan would increase taxes on 84 percent of U.S. households, hitting low- and medium-income households the hardest. The analysis said that households making $10,000 to $20,000 would see whopping tax increases averaging $2,705 -- an increase of nearly 950 percent.\par \par \uc2 The rich, however, would get big tax cuts, the analysis said.\par \par \uc2 Cain's plan would scrap current taxes on income, payroll, capital gains and corporate profits. He would replace them with a 9 percent tax on income, a 9 percent business tax and a 9 percent national sales tax.\par \par \uc2 The study is in line with economic theorists -- whether on the left or right -- who note that sales taxes tend to hit low-income families the hardest because they spend more of their income than wealthier families do.\par \par \uc2 Unlike most states, Cain's plan would not exempt food or medicine from sales taxes. Used items, however, would be exempt.\par \par \uc2 Cain said his plan would create zones where people and businesses could get additional tax deductions, which would reduce taxes for low-income people. The Tax Policy Center said it did not take the zones into account because the Cain campaign did not provide any details on how they would work.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 RICK PERRY: "Mitt, you lose all of your standing, from my perspective, because you hired illegals in your home and you knew about it for a year. And the idea that you stand here before us and talk about that you're strong on immigration is on its face the height of hypocrisy."\par \par \uc2 MITT ROMNEY: "I don't think I've ever hired an illegal in my life."\par \par \uc2 THE FACTS: The truth is that Romney, former Massachusetts governor, never directly hired an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . But he hired a landscaping company that employed them.\par \par \uc2 In bringing up the matter, Texas Gov. Perry resurrected a charge that has dogged Romney since his last presidential bid. In 2006, Romney learned that the landscaper of his suburban Boston home had employed illegal immigrants. He gave the company a second chance under the condition that it would no longer employ undocumented workers.\par \par \uc2 But in 2007, during the height of his first Republican presidential campaign, the same company was caught employing illegal immigrants at Romney's home. Romney then fired the landscaper.\par \par \uc2 At the time, and again Tuesday night, Romney said there's only so much an individual can do when hiring a legitimate company.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 ROMNEY to PERRY: "You were the chairman of Al Gore's campaign."\par \par \uc2 THE FACTS: Romney's claim was misleading, at best. He neglected to mention that Perry's role in Gore's failed 1988 campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination was limited to Texas. It was also marginal.\par \par \uc2 Perry was a Democrat serving in the state legislature at the time and had no significant leadership role in Gore's third-place finish in Texas. He was one of 28 Democratic Texas lawmakers who endorsed Gore. In any event, he was far from being "the chairman" of Gore's campaign. Perry switched parties in 1989 and successfully ran for state agriculture commissioner as a Republican.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 RICK SANTORUM: "(Perry) sent a letter the day of the vote on the floor of the House saying, pass the economic plan. There was only one plan, and that was the plan that was voted on the floor. It was TARP."\par \par \uc2 PERRY: "I'm just telling you I know what we sent, I know what the intention was. You can read it any way you want, but the fact of the matter, I wasn't for TARP, and have talked about it for years since then."\par \par \uc2 THE FACTS: In October 2008, Perry appeared to be both for and against the Troubled Asset Relief Program in the same week.\par \par \uc2 As chairman of the Republican Governors Association, he co-wrote a letter to Congress with his Democratic counterpart that is hard to interpret as anything other than a call to pass the bailout that became known as TARP.\par \par \uc2 "We strongly urge Congress to leave partisanship at the door and pass an economic recovery package," said the letter. It was dated Oct. 1, just after the House rejected an initial version of the economic recovery bill. That vote triggered an 800-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average.\par \par \uc2 But the next day, Perry was quoted in The Dallas Morning News as saying that while he favored some kind of economic recovery plan to help taxpayers, "in a free-market economy, government should not be in the business of using taxpayer dollars to bail out corporate America."\par \par \uc2 Within days, a new version of the bailout was passed by the Senate, then the House, and signed into law by Republican President George W. Bush.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 MICHELE BACHMANN: "Even the Obama administration chose to reject part of Obamacare. ... Now the administration is arguing with itself."\par \par \uc2 THE FACTS: True, the administration is moving to scrap a long-term insurance program that was part of Obama's health care law. But it would be wrong to take that as a sign the administration is losing faith in the overhaul. Quite the contrary.\par \par \uc2 Unlike the central provisions of the health care law, the long-term insurance plan, called CLASS, was voluntary. From an accounting viewpoint, that was its fatal weakness.\par \par \uc2 Without some reason for large numbers of healthy people to sign up, experts warned all along that CLASS would attract too many people in frail health. Rising benefit costs would send premiums spiraling upward. Healthier people would drop out, and eventually taxpayers would have to bail CLASS out.\par \par \uc2 Obama's health insurance mandate, requiring nearly everyone to have insurance, protects his overhaul from a similar fate.\par \par \uc2 "You have to have a broad risk pool," said Robert Bixby, executive director of the Concord Coalition, a nonpartisan group that advocates cutting the federal deficit. "By mandating coverage, (the health care law) creates a broad risk pool and that makes the system much more sustainable."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 ROMNEY to PERRY: "You probably also ought to tell people that if you look over the last several years, 40 percent, almost half the jobs created in Texas were created for illegal aliens, illegal immigrants."\par \par \uc2 THE FACTS: There's some basis for the assertion that significant numbers of jobs were taken by immigrants, but it's a stretch to try to pinpoint how many of them may have been in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 A September report from the conservative-leaning Center for Immigration Studies concluded that 81 percent of new Texas jobs were taken by newly arrived immigrants, basing that on a government survey used to calculate the unemployment rate. The group also estimated that about half of those jobs were taken by illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 The government survey that is the source of the numbers asks people whether they are foreign or native born, but doesn't ask about their legal status. The center's estimate was an extrapolation based on other government estimates of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  populations.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 BACHMANN: "The biggest problem with this administration and foreign policy is that President Obama is the first president since Israel declared her sovereignty (to) put daylight between the United States and Israel."\par \par \uc2 THE FACTS: Israel and the U.S. have had their disagreements and have showed them -- often in far starker contrast than today. And the consequences have been far greater, too.\par \par \uc2 While the Obama administration has criticized Israeli settlement construction on disputed lands, President George H.W. Bush actually punished the Jewish state for the policy by docking housing loan guarantees. President Jimmy Carter experienced tensions with the Israeli government over his public support for a Palestinian homeland, and President Ronald Reagan harshly criticized Israel for a military attack on an Iraqi nuclear plant in the 1980s.\par \par \uc2 Even in times of war, the U.S. and Israel have differed publicly. The worst disagreement came in 1956 when the United States demanded that Israel, Britain and France end their joint war against Egypt.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writers
