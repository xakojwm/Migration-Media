The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 BRADENTON, Fla. (AP) - Eighteen-year-old Leonardo Leal couldn't afford to pay for senior pictures. For years, he didn't have a solitary place to call home. But all that's changing for the guy called Leo by his friends.\par \par \uc2 The Braden River High School valedictorian has been one of Manatee County's sought-after students. Once homeless, Leo has been accepted to Harvard, Stanford and Brown universities. He's also on the wait list at Dartmouth and Princeton. On Saturday, he returned to Bradenton from a visit to Stanford in Palo Alto, Calif. He's already seen Harvard and Washington and Lee University in person.\par \par \uc2 But there will be no more college visits for Leo. He recently announced he'll enroll this fall at Stanford.\par \par \uc2 "I love it here. It's official," he said with enthusiasm. "Stanford offers what I like. The atmosphere, the people, the energy ... it motivates me to study."\par \par \uc2 Leo was offered more than $50,000 in scholarships and grants to attend the university. He will also receive federal aid. When Leo began asking about places to stay before school starts, Stanford University President John Hennessy walked by and offered advice. The conversation served as one of the highlights of Leo's weekend.\par \par \uc2 But he didn't always have that boundless enthusiasm and energy about higher education.\par \par \uc2 "Three years ago, I thought I would never go to college," he said.\par \par \uc2 That was a dark period for Leo. His stepfather asked him to quit school to go to work. When Leo didn't quit, his stepfather kicked him out of the house he shared with his mother and two brothers.\par \par \uc2 "That was the worst," Leo said, recalling how he would make it.\par \par \uc2 The departure from family was a far cry from the more stable days as a young boy in Mexico. He lived there with his grandmother for years.\par \par \uc2 Even today, he considers his loving Magdalena as mother and grandmother. But when her health began to weaken, Leo was sent to live with family in the United States.\par \par \uc2 He came to this country at 12 as an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . As a middle schooler, he had to grasp the English language. It wasn't easy, he said.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, his home life wasn't easy, either. He was shuffled between aunts and cousins from throughout Manatee and Hillsborough counties.\par \par \uc2 He shuffled between Braden River and Palmetto high schools, plus Lennard High in Ruskin. He would go from home to home in at least five different moves.\par \par \uc2 "I would try to stay at the place where I was for as long as I could," Leo said.\par \par \uc2 The third move had him living with his mother and stepfather. It wasn't a good transition. He suffered from his stepfather's harshness.\par \par \uc2 "Sometimes I looked at the sky and wondered why certain things were happening to me," he said. "I just endured."\par \par \uc2 He would pray and remember what his grandmother said to him.\par \par \uc2 "When I didn't know what to do," he said. "She would say, 'Only death doesn't have a solution. Everything else has a solution.' She always told me, 'Never be affected by the negative things.' "\par \par \uc2 He was determined to overlook drugs and gangs. He took her words to heart and began to create new mottoes for himself: "Work hard and try to make a better future for myself."\par \par \uc2 That's the impression he made on Braden River High School's Christy Holt. Leo was in Holt's advance placement class when he was a freshman.\par \par \uc2 "He's a fascinating kid," Holt said. "He won't stop where others would be happy to find an excuse to stop. I don't know if I've met anybody like him."\par \par \uc2 Holt described Leo as a sharp kid with a strong work ethic. She said he isn't a savant, just "extremely intelligent."\par \par \uc2 "I've never met anyone who takes roadblocks and turns them around," Holt said.\par \par \uc2 Deborah Bailey, school district social worker and program manager for Project Heart, called Leo her "genius kid."\par \par \uc2 "We were aware he was well above average," she said.\par \par \uc2 Project Heart is a program that assists families and students who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless. She said it was clear that education was important to Leo.\par \par \uc2 "It was clear he was brilliant because he'd only been in the country for a few years," Bailey said. "He's bounced around from relative to relative over the past couple years. It just impresses me that he's persevered. It would have been much easier to just give up."\par \par \uc2 Gulf Coast Legal Service helped Leo get a special juvenile immigrant status.\par \par \uc2 The special visa allows him to be in the country legally. In five years, he can apply for U.S. citizenship, he said.\par \par \uc2 As a student, he's applied to 13-15 universities, Bailey said. She said that even applying took courage. But he seemed to do it like he did everything else, with "single-minded determination and perseverance."\par \par \uc2 Education helped him focus. He called school "his relief or therapy."\par \par \uc2 "Education was like a pedestal where I could stand and be positive," he said.\par \par \uc2 That positivity served as a key to the door of a dream-filled future. Leo said he now lives in a good place with a cousin in Bradenton.\par \par \uc2 "I have many dreams," he said. "I'm still young."\par \par \uc2 He plans to study either business/international marketing or medicine.\par \par \uc2 "I often thought: Why (did) I have to endure so many things?" Leo asked. "At the same time, the experience I endured made me a stronger person. If I had lived in a different situation, I might not have acquired all the positive situations."\par \par \uc2 In June, he will graduate from Braden River High School, where he is currently ranked first in his class, according to the Manatee County School District.\par \par \uc2 He has a weighted grade point average of 4.66. However, that won't be the only graduation Leo will have this summer.\par \par \uc2 He'll also graduate from the State College of Florida with an associate's degree and 26.5 credit hours.\par \par \uc2 And there's one more thing he wants to do before he starts at Stanford: see his beloved Magdalena.\par \par \uc2 "It's my way of thanking her for all she's done," he said. "She took care of me like a son."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Information from: The Bradenton Herald , {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.bradenton.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.bradenton.com}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110507e757002h0\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) - Abel Moreno is home and humbled.\par \par \uc2 He's the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who won praise a year ago for helping Charlotte stop a rogue police officer who had been sexually assaulting women.\par \par \uc2 But on Christmas Eve, Moreno got into trouble himself: He was arrested for drunken driving - and ended up in a Georgia prison facing deportation.\par \par \uc2 Moreno, 30, spent most of the last four months in a cell, worrying that he had blown his chance to stay in the United States.\par \par \uc2 But Moreno won a reprieve.\par \par \uc2 He was awarded a special visa for helping authorities prosecute former Charlotte-Mecklenburg police Officer Marcus Jackson, who sexually assaulted six women -- including Moreno's girlfriend.\par \par \uc2 Moreno played a key role in the case, risking his freedom to challenge the officer's behavior during a traffic stop.\par \par \uc2 He returned to Charlotte recently to resume the life he has built over the last seven years.\par \par \uc2 "I'm ready to confront my errors," Moreno told the Observer in a phone interview. "I want to be forgiven. I want to do something with my life."\par \par \uc2 Moreno says he wants to rekindle friendships and get his job back as a busboy at a Charlotte restaurant, so he can start sending money again to help his parents in Mexico.\par \par \uc2 He knows it was wrong to drink and drive, he says. He also knows many aren't sympathetic to an immigrant who came to Charlotte illegally, then broke the law.\par \par \uc2 "I just hope people can forgive me," Moreno says. "I did something stupid that I don't do."\par \par \uc2 Moreno grew up poor in a small community outside Acapulco, where there was little work and low pay. He came to the United States in 2004, crossing an Arizona desert on foot and making his way to North Carolina.\par \par \uc2 Moreno soon met a girl and landed a job at a nice restaurant. It was a better life, and he regularly wired money to his family.\par \par \uc2 Then, on the night of Dec. 29, 2009, Moreno was following his girlfriend home when a police officer pulled her over. It was the same officer, Marcus Jackson, who she said had pulled her over weeks earlier and fondled her breast.\par \par \uc2 This time, Moreno was there and confronted Jackson when he touched her again. Moreno called 911, knowing that responding officers might discover his illegal status.\par \par \uc2 Talking to dispatchers, Moreno protested the search, saying the officer is "grabbing" his girlfriend.\par \par \uc2 In the background, Jackson twice ordered: "Hang up the phone."\par \par \uc2 The call ended.\par \par \uc2 Jackson then arrested Moreno on a resisting charge and put him in jail.\par \par \uc2 Moreno later said he couldn't just stand by as the officer assaulted his girlfriend.\par \par \uc2 "She was crying. I felt so bad that this was happening," he said. "I didn't care about the risks."\par \par \uc2 The resisting charge was eventually dropped, but Moreno was identified as an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  through the Mecklenburg jail's 287(g) program. He was targeted for deportation but was soon released for his assistance in the Jackson case and allowed to seek a special "U-visa" for immigrants who are crime victims or witnesses who can help prosecute a criminal.\par \par \uc2 Moreno never expected the notoriety he received in newspapers and on TV.\par \par \uc2 As immigration officials considered his visa request, he carried on his life. He was in the courtroom when Jackson pleaded guilty -- frustrated that the disgraced officer got just two years in prison but glad he could help bring some justice.\par \par \uc2 Then, last Christmas Eve, Moreno went out drinking with friends and got into his Chevy Tahoe to go see his girlfriend.\par \par \uc2 As he drove in east Charlotte around 10 p.m., Moreno ran off the residential road and hit a tree and a telephone pole, a police report says. People in a house nearby ran out to help when they heard the crash.\par \par \uc2 When they asked if he was OK, Moreno took off on foot, witnesses told police. But officers found him, his forehead bleeding, and took him to Presbyterian Hospital.\par \par \uc2 Moreno told police he tried to dodge another car when he crashed and said he had been drinking beer.\par \par \uc2 Police charged him with driving while impaired, driving without an operator's license, and hit and run -- and Moreno went back to the Mecklenburg jail.\par \par \uc2 Before his DWI case could come to court, immigration officials sent Moreno to Stewart Detention Center in Lumpkin, Ga., in January.\par \par \uc2 With no word on his visa request, Moreno was again placed in removal proceedings -- just as 10,000 other immigrants that Mecklenburg has identified as being here illegally have been. Like Moreno, about 1 in 5 of them were stopped for drunken driving.\par \par \uc2 Moreno passed his four months in prison drawing landscapes, and chastising himself for what he calls the worst mistake of his life.\par \par \uc2 His girlfriend felt useless: "I wish I could help him like he helped me."\par \par \uc2 With Moreno unavailable, his DWI charge was dismissed in February.\par \par \uc2 Then, two weeks ago, Moreno got word: His visa had been granted. He can stay in America legally for three years -- then can apply for permanent residency.\par \par \uc2 He'll have to stay clean, he says, and lead a constructive life.\par \par \uc2 Moreno arrived in Charlotte last month.\par \par \uc2 He left a message for his previous employer, then picked up his visa.\par \par \uc2 "I couldn't sleep at all because of everything that has happened," he said. "I can't believe that I'm here."\par \par \uc2 9\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110507e757000kt\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 BRADENTON, Fla. (AP) - Eighteen-year-old Leonardo Leal couldn't afford to pay for senior pictures. For years, he didn't have a solitary place to call home. But all that's changing for the guy called Leo by his friends.\par \par \uc2 The Braden River High School valedictorian has been one of Manatee County's sought-after students. Once homeless, Leo has been accepted to Harvard, Stanford and Brown universities. He's also on the wait list at Dartmouth and Princeton. On Saturday, he returned to Bradenton from a visit to Stanford in Palo Alto, Calif. He's already seen Harvard and Washington and Lee University in person.\par \par \uc2 But there will be no more college visits for Leo. He recently announced he'll enroll this fall at Stanford.\par \par \uc2 "I love it here. It's official," he said with enthusiasm. "Stanford offers what I like. The atmosphere, the people, the energy . . . it motivates me to study."\par \par \uc2 Leo was offered more than $50,000 in scholarships and grants to attend the university. He will also receive federal aid. When Leo began asking about places to stay before school starts, Stanford University President John Hennessy walked by and offered advice. The conversation served as one of the highlights of Leo's weekend.\par \par \uc2 But he didn't always have that boundless enthusiasm and energy about higher education.\par \par \uc2 "Three years ago, I thought I would never go to college," he said.\par \par \uc2 That was a dark period for Leo. His stepfather asked him to quit school to go to work. When Leo didn't quit, his stepfather kicked him out of the house he shared with his mother and two brothers.\par \par \uc2 "That was the worst," Leo said, recalling how he would make it.\par \par \uc2 The departure from family was a far cry from the more stable days as a young boy in Mexico. He lived there with his grandmother for years.\par \par \uc2 Even today, he considers his loving Magdalena as mother and grandmother. But when her health began to weaken, Leo was sent to live with family in the United States.\par \par \uc2 He came to this country at 12 as an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . As a middle schooler, he had to grasp the English language. It wasn't easy, he said.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, his home life wasn't easy, either. He was shuffled between aunts and cousins from throughout Manatee and Hillsborough counties.\par \par \uc2 He shuffled between Braden River and Palmetto high schools, plus Lennard High in Ruskin. He would go from home to home in at least five different moves.\par \par \uc2 "I would try to stay at the place where I was for as long as I could," Leo said.\par \par \uc2 The third move had him living with his mother and stepfather. It wasn't a good transition. He suffered from his stepfather's harshness.\par \par \uc2 "Sometimes I looked at the sky and wondered why certain things were happening to me," he said. "I just endured."\par \par \uc2 He would pray and remember what his grandmother said to him.\par \par \uc2 "When I didn't know what to do," he said. "She would say, 'Only death doesn't have a solution. Everything else has a solution.' She always told me, 'Never be affected by the negative things.' "\par \par \uc2 He was determined to overlook drugs and gangs. He took her words to heart and began to create new mottoes for himself: "Work hard and try to make a better future for myself."\par \par \uc2 That's the impression he made on Braden River High School's Christy Holt. Leo was in Holt's advance placement class when he was a freshman.\par \par \uc2 "He's a fascinating kid," Holt said. "He won't stop where others would be happy to find an excuse to stop. I don't know if I've met anybody like him."\par \par \uc2 Holt described Leo as a sharp kid with a strong work ethic. She said he isn't a savant, just "extremely intelligent."\par \par \uc2 "I've never met anyone who takes roadblocks and turns them around," Holt said.\par \par \uc2 Deborah Bailey, school district social worker and program manager for Project Heart, called Leo her "genius kid."\par \par \uc2 "We were aware he was well above average," she said.\par \par \uc2 Project Heart is a program that assists families and students who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless. She said it was clear that education was important to Leo.\par \par \uc2 "It was clear he was brilliant because he'd only been in the country for a few years," Bailey said. "He's bounced around from relative to relative over the past couple years. It just impresses me that he's persevered. It would have been much easier to just give up."\par \par \uc2 Gulf Coast Legal Service helped Leo get a special juvenile immigrant status.\par \par \uc2 The special visa allows him to be in the country legally. In five years, he can apply for U.S. citizenship, he said.\par \par \uc2 As a student, he's applied to 13-15 universities, Bailey said. She said that even applying took courage. But he seemed to do it like he did everything else, with "single-minded determination and perseverance."\par \par \uc2 Education helped him focus. He called school "his relief or therapy."\par \par \uc2 "Education was like a pedestal where I could stand and be positive," he said.\par \par \uc2 That positivity served as a key to the door of a dream-filled future. Leo said he now lives in a good place with a cousin in Bradenton.\par \par \uc2 "I have many dreams," he said. "I'm still young."\par \par \uc2 He plans to study either business/international marketing or medicine.\par \par \uc2 "I often thought: Why (did) I have to endure so many things?" Leo asked. "At the same time, the experience I endured made me a stronger person. If I had lived in a different situation, I might not have acquired all the positive situations."\par \par \uc2 In June, he will graduate from Braden River High School, where he is currently ranked first in his class, according to the Manatee County School District.\par \par \uc2 He has a weighted grade point average of 4.66. However, that won't be the only graduation Leo will have this summer.\par \par \uc2 He'll also graduate from the State College of Florida with an associate's degree and 26.5 credit hours.\par \par \uc2 And there's one more thing he wants to do before he starts at Stanford: see his beloved Magdalena.\par \par \uc2 "It's my way of thanking her for all she's done," he said. "She took care of me like a son."\par \par \uc2 9\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110507e757000kn\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) - The Alabama Legislature moved a step closer Thursday night to passing an Arizona-style law that would crack down on illegal immigrants and on employers who hire them.\par \par \uc2 The Alabama Senate voted 23-11 for the bill that had already cleared the House. Senators changed it to make it almost identical to a measure that passed the Senate earlier this month.\par \par \uc2 Senate sponsor Republican Sen. Scott Beason of Gardendale said a conference committee will be needed to resolve differences between the House and Senate versions.\par \par \uc2 Both bills would require police officers to demand proof of citizenship or residency from anyone they stop for a traffic violation or other infraction if they have reasonable suspicion the person is in the United States illegally. Those whose legal status can't be determined could be jailed and eventually charged with trespassing if they are determined to be in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 The bills make it a crime to knowingly house, give a ride to, rent to or employ an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 They vary in their punishments and whether businesses are held responsible for subcontractors who use illegal immigrants. But the main difference is that the House bill requires all businesses to use the federal E-Verify program, an Internet-based system that allows an employer to check a potential employee's legal status based on information routinely required on employment forms.\par \par \uc2 The vote on the bill fell mostly on party lines with Democrats opposing it and Republicans supporting it.\par \par \uc2 Opponents said the bill goes too far and will lead to racial profiling by police officers.\par \par \uc2 "It allows discrimination against certain ethnic groups," said Rep. Bobby Singleton, D-Greensboro.\par \par \uc2 But Beason said the bill would reduce unemployment in Alabama by making jobs currently held by illegal immigrants available for legal residents.\par \par \uc2 "This is a jobs bill for Alabama. It puts thousands of Alabamians back to work," Beason said.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110506e756000ct\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHOENIX (AP) - More than 300 doctors and other health professionals from across the country gathered Thursday at the Arizona Capitol to protest the state's anti-illegal immigration law, saying it prevents a vulnerable community from receiving necessary medical care.\par \par \uc2 Jaime Farrant, a policy director with the Border Action Network, said Arizona was fortunate that lawmakers this year failed to pass a proposal that would have made "hospitals into immigration checkpoints." SB1405 would have required hospitals to check the immigration status of patients. Farrant said he fears similar laws would be reintroduced next year.\par \par \uc2 Supporters of such legislation say it saves states millions of dollars in health care services that should only be available to citizens.\par \par \uc2 Opponents at the rally say such laws have no place in the medical community because they overstep their power and interfere with a medical physicians' professional code of ethics.\par \par \uc2 Jason Odhner, a registered nurse in Phoenix, said such laws create fear among illegal immigrants, preventing them from seeking primary medical care -- a situation he calls "a health crisis."\par \par \uc2 "We are sick and tired of the Legislature continuously undermining us," Odhner said.\par \par \uc2 About five busloads of doctors, nurses and other medical professionals came to take part in the rally. Protesters called for a national moratorium on future immigration laws modeled after Arizona's SB1070.\par \par \uc2 "A lot of states that we come from are trying to use Arizona as a model," said Dr. Olveen Carrasquillo, chief of the division of general internal medicine for the University of Miami in Florida.\par \par \uc2 Carrasquillo said the demonstration's purpose was to serve as a statement to lawmakers in other states considering similar laws "to stop the nonsense."\par \par \uc2 A federal appeals court refused last month to lift a stay blocking major part of Arizona's immigration law from taking effect because the federal government is likely to prove the controversial law is unconstitutional.\par \par \uc2 Parts of the law blocked from taking effect while the case works its way through the courts include a provision requiring police to question people's immigration status while enforcing other laws if there is a reasonable suspicion they're in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 Other provisions that are on hold include: requiring all immigrants to obtain or carry immigration registration papers; making it a state criminal offense for an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  to seek work or hold a job; and allowing police to arrest suspected illegal immigrants without a warrant.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110506e7560005n\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) - Illinois children with at least one immigrant parent may become eligible for a privately-funded college scholarship even if they are in the state illegally.\par \par \uc2 The Senate passed legislation 45-11 Wednesday that would enable children of immigrants to draw from a new scholarship called the Illinois DREAM Fund.\par \par \uc2 All no votes came from Republicans, although many supported the legislation. The bill now heads to the House.\par \par \uc2 The bill also will allow illegal immigrants to participate in the state college savings program. Currently, people must be United States citizens to qualify for the savings program.\par \par \uc2 Students must already be employed and enrolled in college to qualify for the scholarship. The state would appoint commissioners to raise and distribute private funds for the scholarship. About 95,000 people would currently be eligible for the program.\par \par \uc2 Supporters say the initiative will lead to better lives by reducing the financial burden on those students and allowing them to focus on education.\par \par \uc2 But some senators were concerned that illegal immigrants were eligible for those funds considering taxpayers fund public universities.\par \par \uc2 "Isn't there a cost paid by taxpayers for every student we educate in the public universities?" asked Sen. Chris Lauzen, R-Aurora.\par \par \uc2 Legislators claimed \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students eligible for the program pay their share through payroll taxes. The bill requires students to obtain a taxpayer identification number through the Internal Revenue Service. The IRS does not share information with the Department of Homeland Security, thus enabling illegal immigrants to hold jobs and pay some taxes -- although not Social Security, benefits from which illegal immigrants cannot draw -- without getting in trouble.\par \par \uc2 Senate President John Cullerton said it would be unfair to penalize \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  children for their parents' actions. He also said the bill would lead to a brighter economic future by allowing more immigrant children to finish college and therefore increase the state's attractiveness with a more educated workforce.\par \par \uc2 "We all remember back when we were children," the Chicago Democrat said during floor debate. "We did not have many choices. We did not choose where to live, we did not choose what clothes to wear, we did not choose what food to eat."\par \par \uc2 Also Wednesday, Gov. Pat Quinn announced that Illinois is pulling out of a controversial federal program that automatically checks the immigration status of arrestees. The move makes Illinois one of the first states to take such a stance against the so-called "Secure Communities" program, which is run by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 The bill is SB2185.\par \par \uc2 Online: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.ilga.gov"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.ilga.gov}}}\par \par \uc2 5\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110505e755000ev\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) - Illinois children with at least one immigrant parent may become eligible for a privately-funded college scholarship even if they are in the state illegally.\par \par \uc2 The Senate passed legislation 45-11 Wednesday that would enable children of immigrants to draw from a new scholarship called the Illinois DREAM Fund.\par \par \uc2 All no votes came from Republicans, although many supported the legislation. The bill now heads to the House.\par \par \uc2 The bill also will allow illegal immigrants to participate in the state college savings program. Currently, people must be United States citizens to qualify for the savings program.\par \par \uc2 Students must already be employed and enrolled in college to qualify for the scholarship. The state would appoint commissioners to raise and distribute private funds for the scholarship. About 95,000 people would currently be eligible for the program.\par \par \uc2 Supporters say the initiative will lead to better lives by reducing the financial burden on those students and allowing them to focus on education.\par \par \uc2 But some senators were concerned that illegal immigrants were eligible for those funds considering taxpayers fund public universities.\par \par \uc2 "Isn't there a cost paid by taxpayers for every student we educate in the public universities?" asked Sen. Chris Lauzen, R-Aurora.\par \par \uc2 Legislators claimed \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students eligible for the program pay their share through payroll taxes. The bill requires students to obtain a taxpayer identification number through the Internal Revenue Service. The IRS does not share information with the Department of Homeland Security, thus enabling illegal immigrants to hold jobs and pay some taxes -- although not Social Security, benefits from which illegal immigrants cannot draw -- without getting in trouble.\par \par \uc2 Senate President John Cullerton said it would be unfair to penalize \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  children for their parents' actions. He also said the bill would lead to a brighter economic future by allowing more immigrant children to finish college and therefore increase the state's attractiveness with a more educated workforce.\par \par \uc2 "We all remember back when we were children," the Chicago Democrat said during floor debate. "We did not have many choices. We did not choose where to live, we did not choose what clothes to wear, we did not choose what food to eat."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 The bill is SB2185.\par \par \uc2 Online: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.ilga.gov"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.ilga.gov}}}\par \par \uc2 5\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110504e754003fj\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

She was turned over to immigration authorities and nearly deported. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement a year ago deferred action on her case for a year to allow her to finish her studies at Kennesaw State University. That delay was to expire Thursday, but ICE has once again deferred action on her case.\par \par \uc2 "ICE uses discretion on a case-by-case basis, as appropriate, and has the authority to grant a deferral of removal action based on the merits of an individual's case and a review of specific facts," an agency spokeswoman said in an email.\par \par \uc2 Colotl's lawyer Charles Kuck recently filed for an extension of her deferred status and said he was pleasantly surprised that ICE acted so quickly.\par \par \uc2 "We so much appreciate ICE's professionalism and compassion in this matter," Kuck said. "They have been exemplary to deal with."\par \par \uc2 Colotl is set to graduate next week from Kennesaw State University and hopes to work for a year before applying to law school.\par \par \uc2 Prompted in part by outcry over Colotl's case, the Georgia university system last fall adopted a policy that bars its schools from accepting illegal immigrants if they've rejected academically qualified applicants in the prior two years.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110503e753003kw\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

GOP lawmakers want to punish people who conceal illegal immigrants, those who hire them\b0\par\par\uc2 By IVAN MORENO   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 489 \uc2 words\par \uc2 2 May 2011\par 18:18\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2011.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 DENVER (AP) - People who conceal illegal immigrants would face criminal charges and employers who fail to show proof that their workers are in the country legally would be fined under a Republican proposal getting its first hearing Monday.\par \par \uc2 The Republican attempt to take another crack at immigration enforcement before this year's session ends is drawing strong criticism from immigration rights advocates, who say friends and relatives of illegal immigrants would be criminalized for not reporting their loved ones to authorities.\par \par \uc2 "I think this bill is clearly a cheap attempt to pander to anti-immigrant sentiment at the expense of real public policy," said Hans Meyer, the policy director of the Colorado Immigrant Rights Coalition.\par \par \uc2 Rep. Randy Baumgardner, R-Hot Sulphur Springs, said his proposal is about jobs and making sure immigrants who came here lawfully are the ones who get them.\par \par \uc2 "This is about jobs and the economy, period. And yes, being here legally whether you're an immigrant or whether you're a citizen," he said.\par \par \uc2 A House committee was scheduled to hear testimony on the bill Monday before taking a vote.\par \par \uc2 Republicans have introduced several immigration enforcement bills this session. While they have had some success in getting bills out of the House, where they have a one-vote advantage, their proposals don't get far in the Democratic-controlled Senate. Less than two weeks remain in the legislative session.\par \par \uc2 Under House Bill 1309, people could face a misdemeanor charge if they conceal an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  or if they "recklessly" disregard their status. The bill provides exceptions for emergency responders or child protective services workers.\par \par \uc2 The measure would also require employers to provide proof to the state's labor department that employees are in the country legally. Employers would be fined $5,000 for first offense and $25,000 for second offense.\par \par \uc2 Other provisions in the bill seek to stop human smuggling by allowing law enforcement to stop vehicles when they have "reasonable suspicion" of a traffic violation, a lower legal standard than probable cause. The bill also makes it a crime for illegal immigrants to apply or solicit work in a public place, and make it illegal to stop and block traffic to pick up people to transport them to a work site.\par \par \uc2 Meyer said those provision raise Constitutional concerns about freedom of speech and they're similar to portions of Arizona's immigration law being challenged in court.\par \par \uc2 Baumgardner pushed another Arizona-style crack down on illegal immigration earlier this year but he shelved his bill over concerns that the proposal would be challenged in court. He said he's more confident about this proposal.\par \par \uc2 "This is not an Arizona immigration bill whatsoever. This is about employment, legal employment, in the state Colorado," he said.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Online:\par \par \uc2 House Bill 1309: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://goo.gl/2xR7P"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://goo.gl/2xR7P}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110502e752003n4\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ATLANTA (AP) - Jose-David and Lourdes Resendiz have lived in Georgia for 14 years, but with the governor likely to sign a bill passed by the Legislature that aims to crack down on illegal immigration, they're packing up their things and preparing to leave.\par \par \uc2 They were among a crowd at a May Day rally Sunday at the Georgia Capitol Sunday that police estimated at about 1,000. Chanting in Spanish and English, waving signs and cheering heartily for each speaker, they urged Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal to veto the bill that contains some provisions similar to a tough law enacted last year in Arizona.\par \par \uc2 Speakers encouraged \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  workers not to leave the state but instead to dig in, organize and mobilize.\par \par \uc2 "In the labor movement we have a saying 'Don't Mourn -- Organize!' We may want to mourn HB87, but let us instead organize like never before," said Ben Speight, organizer director of the Teamsters Local 728\par \par \uc2 The bill passed by state lawmakers last month would authorize law enforcement officers to check the immigration status of certain suspects and to detain them if they are in the country illegally. It would penalize people who knowingly transport or harbor illegal immigrants and makes it a felony to present false documents or information when applying for a job. It also requires many businesses to verify the immigration status of new hires using an online federal database.\par \par \uc2 Deal, who has long been a supporter of strict immigration measures, has said he plans to sign the legislation into law.\par \par \uc2 The bill has drawn criticism from civil liberties and immigrant rights groups, who say it will encourage racial profiling. Many in the business, agriculture, service and tourism and convention sectors have also expressed concern, saying it could drive away their workforce and make Georgia seem unwelcoming.\par \par \uc2 Supporters of the bill say it's necessary to curb illegal immigration, which they say drains the state's resources and contributes to high rates of unemployment.\par \par \uc2 "Gov. Deal and the Legislature found a workable solution that enforces the rule of law and protects Georgia taxpayers while upholding individuals' constitutional rights," Deal spokesman Brian Robinson wrote in an email Friday. "Illegal immigration costs Georgia taxpayers hundreds of millions, if not billions of dollars, each year at the city, county and state levels."\par \par \uc2 Irving Penso, a 64-year-old Atlanta native who teaches English as a second language, said he hopes the governor will "do the right thing" and veto the bill.\par \par \uc2 "The reputation of the state is at stake, this would be a huge step backward," he said. "When one group is oppressed it reflects badly on all of us."\par \par \uc2 Angel Salome, a 17-year-old high school junior, was brought to the United States as a 2-month-old infant strapped to his mother's back as she swam across the Rio Grande. He spoke at the rally and said he'd like his friends to speak out as well. His favorite subject in school is U.S. history, and he plans to go to college and law school with dreams of becoming an immigration lawyer.\par \par \uc2 "I'm going to get that college degree and hopefully be able to provide some financial stability for my mother so she never has to scrub another toilet or tub again," he said after addressing the crowd.\par \par \uc2 In a nod to May Day's roots as a workers' day, Charlie Flemming, of the Atlanta-North Georgia Labor Council, part of the AFL-CIO, told the protesters that organized labor stands behind them.\par \par \uc2 "These state immigration laws unjustly target a segment of our society. It's not only unconstitutional, it's just unfair," he said. "I think it's important for us as a labor movement to embrace our immigrant community. We're really supportive of pushing real, national immigration reform."\par \par \uc2 Resendiz, 40, who works installing insulation, said his wife is packing things up, preparing to leave their home in Buford. He's thinking of heading to Utah. His 42-year-old wife, who works in a Chinese restaurant, said she plans to return to Mexico until he has a chance to assess the situation in Utah, and then she might join him there.\par \par \uc2 "We're illegal, but we came to this country for a better life," Jose-David Resendiz said in Spanish. "We aren't crooks, we aren't violent. We pay taxes and we spend money here. We just want to work to have a better life.\par \par \uc2 Utah's governor recently signed an immigration package that includes an enforcement law reminiscent of Arizona's and would also create a state guest worker program. The Utah law isn't set to enter into effect until 2013 because state officials need time to seek a federal waiver -- for which a process doesn't currently exist -- to give the state the right to issue temporary work permits and other actions generally reserved for the federal government.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110501e751004di\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) - After years of debate, the Alabama Legislature is close to enacting an Arizona-style law cracking down on illegal immigrants and the people who hire them.\par \par \uc2 But first, the two legislators who have been driving the issue must come together on a bill.\par \par \uc2 Republican Sen. Scott Beason of Gardendale and Republican Rep. Micky Hammon of Decatur said they are optimistic that will happen.\par \par \uc2 "Our leadership in the House and Senate is committed to passing a tough immigration bill this year," Hammon said.\par \par \uc2 Hammon's bill has passed the House and has been approved by a Senate committee. It still needs a vote in the Senate.\par \par \uc2 Beason's bill has passed the Senate but has not been considered by a House committee.\par \par \uc2 Both bills would require police officers to demand proof of citizenship or residency from anyone they stop for a traffic violation or other infraction if they have reasonable suspicion the person is in the United States illegally. Those whose legal status can't be determined could be jailed and eventually charged with trespassing if they are determined to be in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 The bills make it a crime to knowingly house, give a ride to, rent to or employ an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 They vary in their punishments and whether businesses are held responsible for subcontractors who use illegal immigrants. But the main difference is that Hammon's bill requires all businesses to use the federal E-Verify program, an Internet-based system that allows an employer to check a potential employee's legal status based on information routinely required on employment forms.\par \par \uc2 Beason's bill requires E-Verify only for companies doing work for the state or through a state grant. He allows other businesses to use whatever means they want to check their new employees. He said he sees no need for a small business to use E-Verify if the owner is hiring someone he's known all his life. Hammon said E-Verify is the best way to make sure jobs go to legal residents.\par \par \uc2 "The goal of this bill is to have attrition of illegal immigrants in Alabama through enforcement," he said.\par \par \uc2 Hammon introduced his first immigration bill seven years ago. Beason offered his first bill five years ago. The two Republicans had no luck when Democrats controlled the Legislature, but they said their luck changed when Republicans won a majority in the House and Senate in November. They've also picked up votes from key Democrats, including House Minority Leader Craig Ford and Senate Minority Leader Roger Bedford.\par \par \uc2 Beason said they were also helped by the downturn in the economy. With more than 9 percent of Alabamians out of work, he said people are more concerned about any available job going to a legal resident.\par \par \uc2 "This is a jobs bill. We can put more people back to work than any other jobs bill in Alabama just by doing something about illegal immigration," Beason said.\par \par \uc2 But getting a bill all the way through the Legislature won't be as easy as getting an agreement between the two Republican legislators.\par \par \uc2 Some Democrats see both bills leading to ethnic profiling and are vowing to fight.\par \par \uc2 "We're going back to some day we don't want to see, where people can be pulled out of a car because they look like somebody," Democratic Sen. Rodger Smitherman said.\par \par \uc2 If Beason and Hammon can complete a bill this year, opponents say state officials can look for a legal challenge like the Arizona law faced. Nikki Cox, an attorney for the ACLU of Alabama, said it will cost the financially strapped state government "precious tax dollars to defend."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110501e751003s6\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) - A former Anchorage police officer accused of being an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who stole a U.S. citizen's identity previously worked as a well-esteemed bus driver in the same city, maintaining an excellent driving record throughout his six-year employment.\par \par \uc2 The driver known as Rafael Espinoza left his job as an Anchorage city bus driver in 2005 to become a police officer here.\par \par \uc2 The Mexico-born officer's real name is Rafael Mora-Lopez, a discovery made after he applied for a passport renewal at the same time the real Rafael Espinoza did, authorities said. The real Espinoza has a dual citizenship and lives outside of the U.S.\par \par \uc2 Mora-Lopez, 47, was arrested last week and is charged with federal passport fraud, which carries a 10-year maximum prison sentence. He has pleaded not guilty and is out on bail under home confinement and electronic monitoring.\par \par \uc2 Both Mora-Lopez and his attorney have declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 In his job as a bus driver, Mora-Lopez passed a criminal background check and was considered an exemplary employee, according to Anchorage's public transportation director, Lance Wilber. In 2001, Mora-Lopez received an award for attendance and his commitment to safety.\par \par \uc2 Mora-Lopez's former co-workers in the department held him in high regard, Wilber said.\par \par \uc2 "Frankly, they were surprised when they heard about this," he said of the identity case.\par \par \uc2 Mora-Lopez was respected as a police officer as well, winning an award after he and another officer conducted CPR on a person last year. He has formally resigned from the job, Police Chief Mark Mew said earlier this week.\par \par \uc2 Espinoza and Mora-Lopez have no known criminal records, so a pre-employment criminal background check by police turned up empty, police and federal authorities said. Mora-Lopez also passed a polygraph test.\par \par \uc2 Municipal attorney Dennis Wheeler said he could not release additional employment information because of personnel privacy rules and because the case is ongoing.\par \par \uc2 Mora-Lopez is married with a child and has lived in Anchorage since the late 1980s, his attorney, Allen Dayan, said in court.\par \par \uc2 In 1998, Mora-Lopez and his wife filed for bankruptcy under chapter seven, according to federal court records posted online, which show the case was closed later the same year. Because the actual court file has been archived, details of the case weren't immediately available Thursday.\par \par \uc2 His arrest leaves the police department juggling various complications, such as potential challenges to Mora-Lopez's testimony in past criminal trials or his pension earned under the assumed identity.\par \par \uc2 The case is similar to one involving a Mexican national who took the identity of a dead cousin who was a U.S. citizen in order to become a Milwaukee police officer. Oscar Ayala-Cornejo was deported to Mexico in 2007.\par \par \uc2 Mora-Lopez's arrest comes two months after another Anchorage police officer, Anthony Rollins, was convicted of sexually assaulting women while on duty.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110428e74s002tj\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 YAKIMA, Wash. (AP) - Jose Maria Morelos is the face of independence, equality and martyrdom in the Mexican state of Michoacan. He was a maverick, a priest turned revolutionary leader who repelled a foreign power for the dignity of his people.\par \par \uc2 Soon his face will become a permanent part of downtown Yakima. It comes in the form of a bust donated by the Mexican government and the city of Morelia, the capital of Michoacan and Yakima's sister city, which takes its name in honor of Morelos.\par \par \uc2 What that will mean to those in this Central Washington city, where dissatisfaction with illegal immigration from Mexico is sometimes especially vocal, is anyone's guess.\par \par \uc2 Proponents of displaying the bust, who successfully lobbied the Yakima City Council earlier this month to place it in a median near a crosswalk, say it will recognize the city's diversity and global ties. Others call the general's bust everything from a futile attempt to promote understanding to a symbol of an invading force.\par \par \uc2 That's the nature of art. It's open to interpretation.\par \par \uc2 "I just want conversations to happen," said Jessica Moskwa, a board member of the Yakima-Morelia Sister City Association who coordinated the project to have the bust placed in the Third Street median. "You don't have to agree."\par \par \uc2 On the other side stand people such as Bob West, leader of the anti-\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  group Grassroots of Yakima Valley, who told the City Council a Mexican military leader's bust will only stir the pot in a community that feels overrun.\par \par \uc2 "We're just living in this era of political correctness," West said. "You don't have to take a gift just because someone gives it to you."\par \par \uc2 Both sides seem to agree that improving relations starts with building relationships, though they diverge on the methods. For Moskwa, it's educating people on the partnership that already exists.\par \par \uc2 "We live in a diverse community. Period," Moskwa said. "How do we go about making our diverse community successful?\par \par \uc2 The bust's arrival coincides with the culmination of 12 years of sister city relations between Yakima and Morelia, and will be unveiled Saturday at the organization's annual celebration.\par \par \uc2 Since 1999, delegations from both cities have gone north and south to share ideas and learn about the other's culture, often touring communities and meeting with more than just dignitaries. The two cities also have close ties because of Yakima's ever-increasing immigrant population, many of whom hail from Michoacan.\par \par \uc2 The exchange of gifts is nothing new either. In 2009, Yakima sent a truckload of donated medical supplies, firefighter training gear and wheelchairs to Morelia.\par \par \uc2 The gift of the bust follows Mexico's celebration of the bicentennial of the start of the war for independence in 1810 and the centennial celebration of the revolution to overthrow dictator Porfirio Diaz in 1910. The office of the Mexican consul delivered the bust, and also bestowed a bust of Miguel Hidalgo, the first leader of the independence movement, to the city of Kent.\par \par \uc2 "In the decision it was very clear that Morelos had to go to Yakima because of the special relationship Yakima has with Morelia," Alejandro Garcia Moreno, the Mexican consul-general in Seattle, said in a telephone interview. "I'm talking here about facts, not just words."\par \par \uc2 Paying respect to famous figures in U.S. history is nothing foreign to Mexico and much of Latin America. A statue of Abraham Lincoln stands along a prominent thoroughfare in Mexico City, and the private John F. Kennedy School in Queretaro, Mexico, boasts more than 1,400 students, the vast majority of which are Mexican.\par \par \uc2 Morelia itself has a preschool named for George Washington.\par \par \uc2 This week another delegation from Morelia arrived to tour different projects and nonprofit efforts in Yakima. The delegation included the wife of the mayor of Morelia, Patricia Mora de Vallejo.\par \par \uc2 Mora de Vallejo appeared confused when she was told about the controversy over the bust of Morelos. She said simply the gift honors the sister-city relationship, though she hopes it also furthers understanding between the two cultures.\par \par \uc2 "It could be a point of dialogue," Mora de Vallejo said.\par \par \uc2 It certainly sparked dialogue on the City Council, which accepted the bust without much squabbling, but split 4-3 in a vote on where to put it. It will be placed at the crosswalk in the median between the former Yakima Mall and Essencia Cafe on North Third Street.\par \par \uc2 The two residents at the meeting opposed to the bust altogether wanted it placed anywhere but out in the open. They recommended inside the offices of the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce or even Fiesta Foods.\par \par \uc2 Speaking against the Morelos bust, West told the council it would only be a matter of time before it would be vandalized at the Third Street location.\par \par \uc2 "I suggest it be placed indoors where people who care about Mexican generals can take care of it," West told council members.\par \par \uc2 Nestor Hernandez, president of the Yakima County Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, said hiding it in an office would defeat the point.\par \par \uc2 "It was not a gift for Hispanic people, it was a gift for the city of Yakima," Hernandez said.\par \par \uc2 Opponents also argued the bust would cost taxpayer money for its upkeep, but Moskwa, who represented the sister city association at the meeting, said a local, privately funded group called the Millennium Foundation would pay for maintenance. The sister city association will pay for a pedestal and the installation.\par \par \uc2 Some critics said the bust's militaristic association is a disservice to American war heroes, who lack much statuary honoring them in Yakima. But supporters point to existing statues and memorials for veterans on Naches Avenue and at Sarg Hubbard Park.\par \par \uc2 "He's one of our heroes, there were many of them," said Hernandez, a Mexican-born U.S. citizen. "Just like Lincoln and other American heroes that fought for the right of the people."\par \par \uc2 The Mexican consul-general was at the meeting when the City Council voted on the bust. Afterward, Moreno made his way around the horseshoe council table shaking hands with council members, including councilman Dave Ettl.\par \par \uc2 "We're a community trying to figure itself out right now, but thank you very much," Ettl told the consul-general as they shook hands.\par \par \uc2 Ettl voted in favor of the bust, but not without referring to what he said are legitimate concerns about illegal immigration turning into misplaced anger toward a piece of art.\par \par \uc2 Days later, Ettl reiterated his stance that the hot-button issue of illegal immigration creates many problems for the community, breeding resentment among those who have watched the change occur.\par \par \uc2 He acknowledged the bust has nothing to do with immigration, but said people will view it however they want.\par \par \uc2 "There's going to be political fallout," Ettl said. "The arts community is above that. They get to promote understanding and they get to walk away when that's not what happens."\par \par \uc2 Moskwa, who is also a former director of Allied Arts, said she knows one piece of art won't ease the tension in the community. The continuing relationship it represents, the further exchange of goodwill between two immigrant nations, is what will change the political landscape over time.\par \par \uc2 "It will be a symbol of what's possible in a community," Moskwa said. "When topics are difficult you can use art as a shared experience, and relationships are the things that transform people."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Information from: Yakima Herald-Republic, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.yakimaherald.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.yakimaherald.com}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110428e74s00266\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) - A legislative plan approved by the Senate on Wednesday to crack down on illegal immigration in Oklahoma is drawing fire from Democrats who say the bill unfairly targets hardworking immigrants and some conservative Republicans who say it doesn't do enough to penalize businesses that employ illegal workers.\par \par \uc2 The bill, which passed on a 37-8 vote, authorizes federally trained police officers to question people about their immigration status in certain circumstances, allows the seizure of vehicles used in human trafficking, and makes it a crime for illegal immigrants to seek employment. But House author George Faught said the bill will be overhauled in a conference committee to focus exclusively on the "public safety" implications of illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 "It's going to look a lot different," said Faught, R-Muskogee. ""It's going to be geared toward public safety, helping law enforcement do the job they're supposed to be doing ... help law enforcement crack down on those crimes, and give them some tools and the ability to do that."\par \par \uc2 Faught says he doesn't anticipate the bill targeting employers who hire illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Republican Gov. Mary Fallin said that although the bill remains a work in progress, she applauds "the goals of this legislation -- to empower our law enforcement officials, rid our communities of crimes like human trafficking and strengthen enforcement measures -- are certainly all things I support."\par \par \uc2 "In light of the federal government's long-standing failure to deal with national illegal immigration problems and President Obama's unwillingness to enforce federal law, states are left to pursue their own reform measures in order to preserve the rule of law and protect their citizens," Fallin said.\par \par \uc2 But freshman Sen. Ralph Shortey, whose campaign centered on cracking down on illegal immigrants, described the proposal as a "do-nothing" bill. He criticized House leaders for failing to consider several immigration-related bills he sponsored to target birth-right citizenship of children born in the United States to \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  parents, impose harsh penalties for employers who hire illegal workers, and give law enforcement the ability to seize the homes and vehicles of illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 "Watered down would be a compliment to this bill," said Shortey, whose south Oklahoma City district has a large Hispanic population. "It basically duplicates federal and state laws that already exist. It's a do-nothing bill. My colleagues know that, and they voted for it anyway."\par \par \uc2 Sen. Jim Wilson, who opposed the measure, said illegal immigrants are an important part of Oklahoma's economy and that Republican leaders are pandering to voters by introducing a bill that does little to address the problem.\par \par \uc2 "The GOP is in a corner on this deal," said Wilson, D-Tahlequah. "We can stop illegal immigration tomorrow by imposing penalties on employers, but they dance around that because they want to protect the employers. What we're seeing is that they want to punish these illegal immigrants, because that panders to the people."\par \par \uc2 Several years ago, Oklahoma enacted what was then one of the toughest illegal immigration bills in the country that required employers to verify the status of workers, eliminated public benefits for illegal immigrants and prohibited illegal immigrants from receiving in-state tuition rates at state colleges and universities. But portions of that measure still remain on hold while a lawsuit works its way through federal court.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, Oklahoma's immigrant community remains fearful they are becoming targets by lawmakers seeking to please voters, said Rev. Victor Orta, pastor of El Pueblo De Dios Baptist Church in Tulsa.\par \par \uc2 "This is just another law in the state of Oklahoma that says to them: 'You are not welcome here,'" Orta said. "Children brought here by immigrant families, who had no say so in coming here, can't further their education and are in constant fear of being deported. These legislators say they believe in hard work and family. Yet, when they approve these laws, what they're doing and what they have done over the last several years is divide families."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110428e74s0002o\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 DENVER (AP) - An attempt to grant illegal immigrants the opportunity to attend Colorado colleges at lower tuition rates failed Monday, the fifth time such legislation has failed amid a debate about what benefits undocumented students deserve.\par \par \uc2 A Republican-led House Education Committee rejected the Democratic proposal on a 7-6 party-line vote after hearing dozens of people testify about legislation that has divided state lawmakers for years. The bill would have allowed illegal immigrants living in Colorado to attend state colleges while paying the lower in-state tuition rate, as opposed to out-of-state tuition, which could be three times more expensive. Supporters of the legislation say the higher tuition rate is a roadblock to a college education for \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students who've been educated in U.S. public school systems.\par \par \uc2 Several high school students filled the committee room dressed in white T-shirts that read "Future Nurse," "Future Chef," and "Future Lawyer." After the vote, Democratic Sen. Michael Johnston, one of the bill's sponsors, tried to console a crying teenage girl who wore a T-shirt that read, "Future Social Worker."\par \par \uc2 Democrats supporting the bill said that allowing more students the opportunity to attend college would be an economic boost for the state's future. Republicans opposing the measure argued that it could entice more illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 "Are we teaching a new generation that it's OK not to follow the laws of our country?" Republican Rep. Robert Ramirez, the only Hispanic GOP member in House. "That scares me."\par \par \uc2 Ramirez recounted how his father, a Mexican immigrant, came to the U.S. and struggled to gain legal residency. He took a long pause before saying "no" to the bill, and indicated beforehand that he was conflicted on the matter.\par \par \uc2 "It's a tough decision for me. For all of us here. It's one that for me, doesn't matter which way I vote, it's detrimental and it's good," he said.\par \par \uc2 Denver interim Mayor Guillermo "Bill" Vidal, a Cuban immigrant and the city's first foreign-born mayor, was among those speaking in support of the legislation.\par \par \uc2 "I'm just like these kids that we're trying to help here today. The difference for me is that the Cubans got political asylum from the United States and my residency was established immediately," Vidal said. He said other immigrants have a more difficult time gaining legal status.\par \par \uc2 "I'm here to plead with you when thinking about these kids, it's important to separate their plight from the debate on illegal immigration," he said.\par \par \uc2 The measure easily passed the Senate earlier this month, but only Democrats supported it.\par \par \uc2 Colorado's Senate Bill 126 would have allowed \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students to qualify for in-state tuition if they meet certain criteria, such as attending a Colorado high school for at least three years and graduating from a state school. Under the bill, illegal immigrants would still pay more than other students because they would be ineligible for a Colorado stipend granted to legal in-state tuition residents to use at a college of their choice.\par \par \uc2 Eleven states have laws granting in-state tuition to illegal immigrants, including California, Illinois, Kansas and Texas. Maryland's Legislature recently passed similar legislation that is awaiting the governor's signature. Although there have been court challenges, the law has not been overturned in the states that have it.\par \par \uc2 Still, Colorado Republicans warned the Democrats' proposal would run afoul of a federal law states that illegal immigrants cannot receive a benefit not given to U.S. citizens.\par \par \uc2 Eddie Lake, an Aurora businessman, said he sympathizes with \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students, but that he was upset that lawmakers are "giving my country away."\par \par \uc2 "I'm getting pretty damn tired. I've got children, grandchildren, I've got nieces and nephews in other states who would like to come here and go to college with the in-state tuition," he said.\par \par \uc2 Democratic Sen. Angela Giron, one of the sponsors of the bill, wiped away tears after the vote and said she would propose the legislation again next year.\par \par \uc2 "It just breaks my heart for the kids," she said.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Online:\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://goo.gl/FLEom"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://goo.gl/FLEom}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110426e74q0005q\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 DENVER (AP) - A Republican-led committee in the Colorado House could halt an attempt to lower tuition rates for illegal immigrants when the measure is heard Monday.\par \par \uc2 The bill would allow illegal immigrants from Colorado to attend state colleges while paying the lower in-state tuition rate, as opposed to out-of-state tuition, which could be three times more expensive.\par \par \uc2 The measure passed the Senate earlier this month, but only Democrats supported it. Republicans control the House Education Committee, which will hear the proposal.\par \par \uc2 Under the bill, illegal immigrants would still pay more than other students because they would be ineligible for a Colorado stipend granted to legal in-state tuition residents to use at a college of their choice.\par \par \uc2 Supporters say the students shouldn't be punished if their parents brought them to Colorado illegally. Opponents say allowing those students to avoid out-of-state tuition could entice more illegal immigrants. The change has been considered four other times in Colorado but never passed the full Legislature.\par \par \uc2 Colorado's Senate Bill 126 would allow \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students to qualify for in-state tuition if they meet certain criteria, such as attending a Colorado high school for at least three years and graduating from a state school.\par \par \uc2 Republicans have questioned the proposal's legality, saying federal law states that illegal immigrants cannot receive a benefit not given to U.S. citizens.\par \par \uc2 Eleven states have laws granting in-state tuition to illegal immigrants, including California, Illinois, Kansas and Texas. Although there have been court challenges, the law has not been overturned in the states that have it.\par \par \uc2 The Colorado bill would also require students to sign an affidavit with a college saying they are trying to obtain legal residency, a provision that other states have included in their legislation.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Online:\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://goo.gl/FLEom"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://goo.gl/FLEom}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110425e74p001pc\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 ATLANTA (AP) - Some Georgia business owners and farmers say they could have a harder time finding workers because of a bill passed by lawmakers to crack down on illegal immigration -- among the toughest in the nation.\par \par \uc2 Republican Gov. Nathan Deal has pledged to sign the bill, which would require employers to use a federal database to make sure new hires are in the country legally. It also would allow law enforcement to check the status of people being investigated, even during a traffic stop, if they don't have an acceptable form of identification.\par \par \uc2 Business owners say the measure could make non-citizen workers reluctant to apply for jobs and make hiring new employees more expensive and cumbersome.\par \par \uc2 Atlanta chef Chris Hall, who said he relies on an immigrant work force, opposes the bill in part because of fears his workers could be subject to racial profiling.\par \par \uc2 "My guy's supposed to be here at 5, but if he's pulled over for being brown in his car on the way here and he doesn't get here until 6, that's a problem," said Hall, who co-owns Local Three restaurant. "A lot of us wonder, if you start taking away parts of our labor force, can we replace that?"\par \par \uc2 Hall, who said he follows federal requirements to ensure his employees are in the country legally, said that in 10 years of working in restaurants he hasn't seen a U.S. citizen apply for a dishwashing job.\par \par \uc2 Civil liberties and immigrant rights groups, as well as some Democratic lawmakers, have also raised concerns that possible racial profiling and strict hiring rules could cause both legal and illegal immigrants to leave the state, which they say would diminish the work force and hurt the state's economy.\par \par \uc2 The bill's sponsor, state Rep. Matt Ramsey, R-Peachtree City, has said illegal immigrants are a drain on the state's resources. He and law enforcement officials dismissed fears of profiling.\par \par \uc2 "We've got to have probable cause to make a stop, probable cause that a criminal or traffic offense has occurred, and probable cause is based on probable cause, not the color of one's skin," said Terry Norris, executive director of the Georgia Sheriff's Association.\par \par \uc2 The law -- which has provisions similar to a crackdown passed in Arizona last year that led to protests and court fights -- would allow officers to detain an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , though it's unlikely cash-strapped local jails will keep people in custody if they haven't been charged with a crime and won't be taken into custody by federal authorities, Norris said.\par \par \uc2 And officers won't necessarily check immigration status in every instance because they are authorized -- but not required -- to do so, meaning departments can craft policies that fit their communities, said Frank V. Rotondo, executive director of the Georgia Association of Chiefs of Police.\par \par \uc2 He said some amount of instruction will likely be necessary for officers in the course of ongoing training.\par \par \uc2 "We don't want to have a young, zealous officer attempting to enforce the law in a way he believes is correct and ending up doing something wrong," he said.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, farmers and others are worried about using the free federal database, E-Verify, to make sure new hires are in the U.S. legally. By July 1, 2013, all companies with more than 10 workers will have to use the system.\par \par \uc2 Aaron McWhorter of Whitesburg, about 45 miles southwest of Atlanta, already uses E-Verify for his construction company because it has public contracts, but he's loathe to implement it at his sod farm, he said.\par \par \uc2 "It's not difficult to use," he said. "But the process is kind of time-consuming and protracted because you can't prescreen people with it."\par \par \uc2 E-Verify can only be used once someone is hired. McWhorter said he has had instances in which he put people on payroll and started training them, only to find out the database indicated they were not eligible to work. In some cases it was a mistake because of a misspelled name or other error. But if it's not, McWhorter said he's wasted time and money training someone he has to fire.\par \par \uc2 "Down the road, I see a shortage of labor," McWhorter said.\par \par \uc2 Supporters of the bill have said farmers and others can bring in unlimited seasonal workers through a federal guest worker program. However, Bill Brim, a vegetable farmer near Tifton about 180 miles south of Atlanta, said it already costs him time and money to bring in 477 workers using that H-2A visa program. Having to use E-Verify for those workers and the other roughly 200 workers he hires locally will cost him even more.\par \par \uc2 "We'll have to hire somebody else to help implement the program," he said. "It's going to cost us money and already with H-2A we're spending so much money on domestic workers and H-2A workers because of all the stuff we have to do."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110421e74l002oy\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - \uc2 Illegal immigrant\uc2  students will no longer be eligible for in-county tuition rates at one New Jersey college.\par \par \uc2 The board of trustees at the County College of Morris reversed part of a policy it had approved in February that ended a 10-year ban on admitting illegal immigrants and permitted them to pay in-county tuition rates.\par \par \uc2 The original policy, passed in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, had barred illegal immigrants from taking classes. The board had voted in February to overturn that, allowing \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students to enroll if they meet certain criteria, including being able to prove they came to the United States before age 16, have been living in the U.S. for at least five years and have graduated from a U.S. high school or with an equivalency diploma. The policy also allowed those able to prove residence in Morris County to pay in-county full-time tuition rates of about $4,000 compared with more than $10,000 for out-of-state students.\par \par \uc2 The board voted 9-to-2 to reverse the tuition portion of the policy at Wednesday night's meeting and require \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students to pay out-of-state tuition rates.\par \par \uc2 The Daily Record of Parsippany reported that the vote came at a packed meeting after nearly four hours of discussions.\par \par \uc2 Those who supported the reversal cited recommendations from the trustees' Minority Enrollment and Retention Committee that said in part the school shouldn't be taking action on the issue in the absence of clearer legal guidelines.\par \par \uc2 "Guidance and resolution of this weighty public policy must come from the judicial or legislative branches," the report said in part. The committee recommended revisiting the issue if there are any changes to state or federal policy.\par \par \uc2 The Morris County Freeholder board, which is responsible for about 20 percent of the college's budget, had objected to granting in-county tuition for \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students, saying money should only be used to subsidize tuition rates for students born in the United States or living in the U.S. legally.\par \par \uc2 Several of New Jersey's community colleges, and some private colleges, currently allow illegal immigrants to enroll or don't ask for immigration status on school applications.\par \par \uc2 In December, the presidents of more than half the state's 19 community colleges, in consultation with their boards of trustees, signed a letter in support of the Dream Act, federal legislation that would have allowed immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally before the age of 16 the chance to legalize their statuses by completing at least two years of college or military service if they satisfied certain criteria.\par \par \uc2 The bill, which did not pass, also would have granted states the power to decide whether to allow students covered by the bill to pay in-state tuition rates.\par \par \uc2 The issue has stirred an ongoing debate across the U.S.\par \par \uc2 Opponents say allowing illegal immigrants to enroll in U.S. colleges takes seats away from legal residents, usurps scarce resources and encourages more illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 Supporters, including many \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students, say those who are brought to the United States as children, are educated in local school systems and graduate from U.S. high schools are faced with a dead-end after their senior year, regardless of how hard they work. They say getting a college education and entering the workforce would make them less of a burden on taxpayers.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Information from: Daily Record, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.dailyrecord.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.dailyrecord.com}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110421e74l001he\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SALT LAKE CITY (AP) - The Texas congressman who heads the U.S. House Judiciary Committee has accused the Justice Department of being "hypocritical" for not pursuing legal action against a Utah law approving a guest worker program for illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, said in a letter Monday to U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder that the Utah law approving the program is unconstitutional, and called the department's inaction a "stark contrast" to the federal government's lawsuit against Arizona for a law "that merely complements and assists in the enforcement of federal immigration law."\par \par \uc2 "This is hypocritical. If (the Justice Department) chooses not to take legal action against Utah's unconstitutional law, it will be clear the Administration bases their decisions on their own political views rather than constitutional principle," Smith said in a statement to The Associated Press.\par \par \uc2 The Utah law doesn't take effect for two years, which state officials said was done specifically to avert a lawsuit. The state is seeking a federal waiver.\par \par \uc2 In his letter, Smith said the government's inaction would reinforce the perception that it only opposes strict enforcement measures such as Arizona's law.\par \par \uc2 In its challenge to Arizona's law, the Justice Department argued the measure intrudes on its exclusive authority to regulate immigration, disrupts U.S.-Mexico relations, hinders cooperation between state and federal officials, and puts burdens on legal immigrants. A federal judge put key parts of that law on hold last July, a ruling the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld earlier this month.\par \par \uc2 Smith said that if Obama's administration "is serious about having a uniform immigration policy rather than a 'patchwork' of state immigration laws you profess to oppose, then the Administration needs to take action against the Utah law."\par \par \uc2 A showdown with federal officials is the last thing Utah wants, the state's Attorney General Mark Shurtleff said. He and Utah Gov. Gary Herbert have met with federal officials, including members of the Justice Department.\par \par \uc2 Shurtleff, a Republican, said Smith's letter is not only wrong, but strictly political.\par \par \uc2 "He's riding right along the line of the hard right wing radicals," said Shurtleff. "He's trying to stick his nose into Utah's business and play politics."\par \par \uc2 Herbert said the lawsuit threat was "typical Washington" and that legal action would be a waste of time.\par \par \uc2 "The people of the U.S. would be better served if the federal government used the time between now and 2013 to actually address immigration, rather than sue Utah for trying to manage the practical realities we face as states due to the absence of federal action," Herbert said.\par \par \uc2 A Justice Department spokeswoman said the letter was being reviewed.\par \par \uc2 Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer's lawyers has argued the federal government hasn't effectively enforced immigration law and that the state's intent in passing the law was to assist federal authorities, as Congress has encouraged.\par \par \uc2 Utah's guest worker program was part of an immigration reform package signed into law March 15 by Utah's governor. The package included an enforcement measure that was modeled on Arizona's law that goes into effect in May.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writer Kate Brumback contributed to this story from Atlanta.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110420e74k003in\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

Gabrielle Giffords.\par \par \uc2 Requests included questions about whether the college ever sought to get Loughner a mental health evaluation when he was a student at the college, or whether he threatened to kill anyone on campus. The college either refused to answer questions or released short, prepared statements.\par \par \uc2 Loughner began attending classes at the college in 2005, but was eventually kicked out because of behavior campus police considered disturbing. He was told to get a mental health evaluation or not return.\par \par \uc2 In one email, college Chancellor Roy Flores told all employees that national news media organizations had sent teams of reporters to campus looking for anyone who knew Loughner. He instructed them not to delete any emails mentioning Loughner so the college could comply with public records laws.\par \par \uc2 "I do not think that the demands made on the college will abate any time soon, so we will have to find ways of conducting our normal duties, as well as meeting these additional demands," he said in the email, sent just after 6 a.m. on Jan. 11.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Nixon raises $1.7M; Kinder raises $771,000\par \par \uc2 JEFFERSON CTIY, Mo. (AP) -- Missouri Democratic Gov. Jay Nixon raised about twice as much for his re-election bid as Republican Lt. Gov. Peter Kinder.\par \par \uc2 State campaign finance reports released Friday showed that Nixon's campaign brought in nearly $1.7 million during the past six months and had slightly more than $2 million in its bank account at the end of March. Kinder raised roughly $771,000 over the same period and reported just over $902,000 in available cash.\par \par \uc2 Missouri candidates for next year's elections were required to file campaign finance reports Friday with the state Ethics Commission.\par \par \uc2 The campaigns for both Nixon and Kinder said the fundraising over the past half-year signaled strong support from Missourians. Nixon was elected governor in 2008. Kinder, who is serving his second term as lieutenant governor, has not formally announced his candidacy for governor but is expected to challenge Nixon in the 2012 election.\par \par \uc2 Nixon's campaign said it received donations from 986 contributors -- of whom more than 90 percent are from Missouri.\par \par \uc2 "The early financial support is critical, but the real reason that Jay Nixon is in a strong position to be re-elected is the tough and effective leadership he's shown as governor during these challenging times," said Oren Shur, who is Nixon's campaign manager.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Mo. school accreditation changes could be on hold\par \par \uc2 KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- A top Missouri education official says she will recommend the State Board of Education withdraw a proposal to make sweeping changes in how the state accredits its public schools to allow more time to build support for it.\par \par \uc2 State Education Commissioner Chris Nicastro said there appears to be a lack of understanding about the proposal and more time is needed to meet with educators, parents and community leaders to see what changes may be needed to gain support.\par \par \uc2 The proposal includes folding in new statewide tests as they become available and reporting on how districts' graduates fare in their pursuit of college degrees. Districts also would be reviewed annually instead of once every five years and would report a host of new details on everything from their early childhood programs to the percentage of students completing federal financial aid forms.\par \par \uc2 "We know that the proposed standards might not be perfect, but they do offer a sound proposal that has the interests of nearly 1 million students and their futures in mind," Nicastro said in a news release sent Thursday night.\par \par \uc2 The State Board of Education gave initial approval to the plan last month, but then the Missouri Association of School Administrators voted to ask the board to delay finalizing the changes until educators could voice their concerns. The Board of Education had been set to make a final decision in May. If the board agrees to withdraw the proposal when it meets Wednesday, it wouldn't consider the issue again until the fall.\par \par \uc2 "I will give the commissioner credit for understanding there was discontent out there and taking action," Roger Kurtz, the administrators association's executive director, said Friday.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 GSA: carcinogen found at federal site\par \par \uc2 KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Detectable levels of a carcinogen have been found in a General Services Administration building at the Bannister Federal Complex in south Kansas City, next to a plant that makes parts for nuclear weapons, a GSA spokesman said.\par \par \uc2 The announcement Thursday came the same day that the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health released a separate report saying GSA employees have not been exposed to significant levels of toxins.\par \par \uc2 GSA employees were concerned that some have become ill from toxins at the site.\par \par \uc2 Jason Klumb, GSA's administrator, confirmed the presence of a carcinogen during questioning at a press conference called to discuss the federal health report, according to The Kansas City Star. Klumb would not identify the carcinogen or the level that was found, but he said testing had been done for both beryllium and uranium. He would not say if both toxins had detectable levels.\par \par \uc2 Klumb said the Environmental Protection Agency was handling the testing and that GSA was waiting for final results.\par \par \uc2 "When we get it from the EPA we will share everything that we find," Klumb said.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Mo. judge stays part of order rejecting ethics law\par \par \uc2 JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) -- A Missouri judge has delayed part of his ruling to strike down a new ethics and campaign finance law.\par \par \uc2 Cole County Circuit Judge Dan Green ruled last month that the 2010 law was unconstitutional because it addressed more subjects than was conveyed by its title. He also ruled that a prohibition on donations by state-chartered banks to political action committees violated free speech rights.\par \par \uc2 Green has now stayed part of the ruling, but the section on campaign contributions by banks remains in effect.\par \par \uc2 The Missouri attorney general's office said Friday that it requested the judge delay the effect of the ruling until appeals are completed.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Washington U. seeks to host 2012 debate\par \par \uc2 ST.

The commission will announce final sites later this year.\par \par \uc2 Washington University hosted presidential debates in 1992, 2000 and 2004, and the vice presidential debate in 2008.

Senate after emotional debate\b0\par\par\uc2 By IVAN MORENO   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 632 \uc2 words\par \uc2 15 April 2011\par 20:29\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2011.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 DENVER (AP) - Colorado Senate Democrats advanced a proposal Friday to grant in-state tuition to illegal immigrants, an issue that triggered emotional arguments from Hispanic lawmakers who choked back tears as they urged support of the bill.\par \par \uc2 Only Democrats supported the bill when it passed on a preliminary vote, with Republicans arguing the proposal provides an incentive for immigrants to come to the U.S. illegally.\par \par \uc2 Democratic Sen. Angela Giron's voice quivered as she told lawmakers that she has relatives who are in the country illegally, a circumstance she said perhaps wouldn't resonate with her colleagues.\par \par \uc2 "And so I'm thinking, gosh, but I bet they have grandkids, and they have kids," said Giron, a first-year lawmaker from Pueblo.\par \par \uc2 This is the fifth time Colorado Democrats have tried to pass a bill giving illegal immigrants the chance to pay lower in-state tuition rates. Senators must vote one more time before the measure goes to the House, where Republicans have a one-person edge.\par \par \uc2 Sen. Shawn Mitchell, a Republican from Broomfield, said the bill is misguided because \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students will not be able to legally get jobs in this country when they graduate from college.\par \par \uc2 "It's a false promise. It's false hope. It's the politics of gesture and of symbolism," he said.\par \par \uc2 Other Republicans questioned the proposal's legality, saying federal law states that illegal immigrants cannot receive a benefit not given to U.S. citizens.\par \par \uc2 Eleven states have laws granting in-state tuition to illegal immigrants, including California, Illinois, Kansas and Texas. Although there have been court challenges, the law has not been overturned in the states that have it.\par \par \uc2 Similar legislation is pending in Oregon, where the measure recently passed the Senate and is awaiting a vote in the House.\par \par \uc2 Colorado's Senate Bill 126 would allow \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students to qualify for in-state tuition if they meet certain criteria, such as attending a Colorado high school for at least three years and graduating from a state school.\par \par \uc2 It requires that students sign an affidavit with a college saying they are trying to obtain legal residency, a provision that other states have included in their legislation.\par \par \uc2 The latest Colorado bill is different from past versions because it makes \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students ineligible for a state stipend that in-state tuition students can use at a college of their choice. That means illegal immigrants would still pay more than others who get in-state tuition.\par \par \uc2 Republicans who opposed the bill said taxpayers would still be subsidizing college for illegal immigrants because having additional students will lead to higher operating costs -- an argument Democrats disputed.\par \par \uc2 Republicans also said the proposal would reward illegal behavior.\par \par \uc2 "We typically punish people who break the law," El Paso County Republican Sen. Bill Cadman said. "We're proving a singular exception for those who are breaking the law in this country."\par \par \uc2 Democratic Sen.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) - South Carolina budget writers on Thursday turned to tax scofflaws to help patch the state's budget.\par \par \uc2 They've been a repeated target, but the twist this time? The crackdown would aim to collect from out-of-state tax cheats and help generate money to enforce the state's \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  laws and revive a mothballed Statehouse security system.\par \par \uc2 The Senate Finance Committee wrapped up work Thursday on a $5.8 billion spending plan. That includes more than $509 million in cash mostly from unneeded reserves, growing state surpluses, the tax crackdown and the state's increased cigarette tax.\par \par \uc2 The tax crackdown would give the state Department of Revenue $4 million to track down companies and individuals outside the state in an effort that "goes after the tax cheats -- and that's what they are," Senate Finance Committee Chairman Hugh Leatherman said. "I don't think that we've touched those people yet," the Florence Republican said.\par \par \uc2 The agency has promised the campaign would collect $80 million in unpaid tax revenue. Officials with the department did not immediately respond to an interview request to talk about its chances to deliver the amount of money expected by budget writers.\par \par \uc2 Gov. Nikki Haley, was aware of and approved the program, though she's not ready to comment on how the money is spent, Haley spokesman Rob Godfrey said.\par \par \uc2 "The governor has been very involved in the budget process thus far and will continue to be, and, given that the budget has just come out of Senate finance, we look forward to studying it," Godfrey said.\par \par \uc2 The spending plan adds $722,925 to the Department of Public Safety budget to cover 12 positions that will enforce the state's illegal immigration laws. That includes changes the Senate approved earlier this year that now are being discussed in the House Judiciary Committee. The legislation calls for a new "border patrol" unit.\par \par \uc2 The Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation also is directed to put $1.4 million into enforcing illegal immigration laws.\par \par \uc2 Legislators are looking for protection, too. The budget bill, scheduled for debate in two weeks, includes $900,000 to revive a Statehouse security system that Gov. Mark Sanford mothballed in 2009. That cash pays for 12 Department of Public Safety positions.\par \par \uc2 Sanford objected to tighter security at the Capitol, downplaying possible threats that legislators believe exist.\par \par \uc2 "I think we are sitting ducks here," Leatherman said.\par \par \uc2 The spending plan's extra cash is spread throughout state agencies and helps bolster state programs that, among other things, cover cancer screenings, the state's disabled and drugs for AIDS patients. For instance, cancer screenings pick up $2 million and the budget includes $5 million for the AIDS drug assistance program.\par \par \uc2 The largest chunk of the extra cash goes to state Medicaid programs, which pick up $214 million. Most of that comes from the state's increased cigarette tax.\par \par \uc2 Another large piece goes into public education programs. They pick up $128 million, with $97 million used to increase per student spending. The extra cash also includes $20 million used to help shield some school districts from losing money under the state's education funding formula. Major fights loom as the spending plan heads to the floor for debate where tea party-leaning Republicans will have a chance to cut spending.\par \par \uc2 For instance, Sen. Kevin Bryant, an Anderson Republican and pharmacist, said he'll again attempt to require HIV/AIDS and mental health patients on Medicaid to use generic drugs. "My principles have more support on the floor than in this committee," Bryant said. "We can't allow Medicaid to pay for brand names when the generic is available. That is a total, irresponsible worthless waste of money."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110415e74f0020m\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

Legislature\b0\par\par\uc2 By BILL KACZOR   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 809 \uc2 words\par \uc2 15 April 2011\par 08:48\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2011.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) - Neither tears, nor prayer nor opposition from influential business groups could sway a House committee that voted largely along party lines Thursday for a Republican-sponsored bill that would follow Arizona's lead and make illegal immigration a state crime in Florida.\par \par \uc2 That legislation and a similar Senate bill also would require employers to use a federal database to verify the immigration status of new hires.\par \par \uc2 While other opponents, some identifying themselves as undocumented immigrants, knelt in prayer and two young girls burst into tears, business lobbyists argued the legislation would hurt Florida's tourism and agriculture industries while reducing tax revenues.\par \par \uc2 "Just the mere consideration of this bill is causing the image of the state of Florida to be tarnished not only nationally but internationally," said Florida Chamber of Chamber Vice President Adam Babington. He said that "will have economic consequences."\par \par \uc2 It would scare off tourists from Latin American and the Caribbean who contribute billions to Florida's economy and millions to state coffers, Babington argued.\par \par \uc2 "Please do not make Florida employers immigration officials," pleaded Tom Stahl, executive director of Florida United Businesses Association. "We view it as regulation, which is somewhat ironic given the tenor of the Legislature this year."\par \par \uc2 Following the lead of Republican Gov. Rick Scott, the GOP-controlled Legislature has focused heavily making Florida friendlier to business including reductions in government regulations.\par \par \uc2 Others argued that Florida produce would rot in the fields without immigrants to pick the crops and that the bill would be unconstitutional because immigration is controlled by federal law.\par \par \uc2 Supporters said the legislation is needed because the federal government has failed to control the nation's borders and it would put pressure on Washington to fix that problem.\par \par \uc2 "Despite some of the rhetoric and the obfuscation that's gone on here today, the main fear is that businesses will lose their undocumented workers," said Rep. William Snyder, a Stuart Republican sponsoring the House bill.\par \par \uc2 "Somebody came up here and said we won't have tomatoes in our salad," Snyder added. "I would rather eat bread than eat something that was gleaned off the sweat of someone who has less rights than me."\par \par \uc2 The legislation is very personal for some who testified.\par \par \uc2 "I am undocumented, unapologetic and unafraid," said Jose Manuel Godinez-Samperio,\par \par \uc2 Now 24 and set to graduate next month from Florida State University's law school, he said his parents brought him illegally to the United States when he was 9 years old.\par \par \uc2 "This bill would totally shatter may dreams," said Godinez-Samperio. "I've been raised in this country. I speak just like you. I think just like you. I act just like you. Why?"\par \par \uc2 Kevin Lopez Gutierrez, a 17-year-old high school student from Indiantown, said his parents brought him illegally to the United States when he was 5 years old.\par \par \uc2 "I don't want to go back to Mexico cause I was raised here in the U.S.," he told the House panel. "I'm proud to say I'm an American, but I can't be; I'm illegal."\par \par \uc2 "We don't want you guys to separate our families from us," 10-year-old Karla Amaya of Clearwater told lawmakers before she and a young friend broke into tears.\par \par \uc2 Besides up to 20 days in jail and a $100 fine for a first offense, undocumented immigrants would face enhanced penalties if convicted of other crimes. Like Arizona's law, police could check someone's immigration status only if that person is under investigation for another criminal offense if there is a reasonable suspicion they're in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 The Florida legislation does not include Arizona provisions also requiring all immigrants to obtain or carry immigration registration papers and making it a state criminal offense for an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  to seek work or hold a job.\par \par \uc2 A study by the Pew Hispanic Center ranked Florida third among the states with an estimated 825,000 unauthorized immigrants, or 4.5 percent of the state's population, last year.\par \par \uc2 The House Economic Affairs Committee approved the bill (HB 7089) 11-7 with most Republicans in favor and most Democrats against. It next goes to the House floor. The Senate version (SB 2040) is awaiting a final committee hearing.\par \par \uc2 The legislation also has drawn opposition from Associated Industries of Florida, the Florida Fruit and Vegetable Association, farmworker advocates and Christian and Jewish clergy.\par \par \uc2 It's got the support, though, of Scott, who already has issued an executive order requiring state agencies and contractors to use the federal database when hiring.\par \par \uc2 "If people are in our country and violating the law then we ought to be able to ask if they're legal or not," Scott said.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110415e74f001ww\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

Senate after emotional debate\b0\par\par\uc2 By IVAN MORENO   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 609 \uc2 words\par \uc2 15 April 2011\par 17:15\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2011.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 DENVER (AP) - Colorado Senate Democrats advanced a proposal Friday to grant in-state tuition to illegal immigrants, an issue that triggered emotional arguments from Hispanic lawmakers who choked back tears as they urged support of the bill.\par \par \uc2 Only Democrats supported the bill when it passed on a preliminary vote, with Republicans arguing the proposal provides an incentive for immigrants to come to the U.S. illegally.\par \par \uc2 Democratic Sen. Angela Giron's voice quivered as she told lawmakers that she has relatives who are in the country illegally, a circumstance she said perhaps wouldn't resonate with her colleagues.\par \par \uc2 "And so I'm thinking, gosh, but I bet they have grandkids, and they have kids," said Giron, a first-year lawmaker from Pueblo.\par \par \uc2 This is the fifth time Colorado Democrats have tried to pass a bill giving illegal immigrants the chance to pay lower in-state tuition rates. Senators must vote one more time before the measure goes to the House, where Republicans have a one-person edge.\par \par \uc2 Sen. Shawn Mitchell, a Republican from Broomfield, said the bill is misguided because \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students will not be able to legally get jobs in this country when they graduate from college.\par \par \uc2 "It's a false promise. It's false hope. It's the politics of gesture and of symbolism," he said.\par \par \uc2 Other Republicans questioned the proposal's legality, saying federal law states that illegal immigrants cannot receive a benefit not given to U.S. citizens.\par \par \uc2 Eleven states have laws granting in-state tuition to illegal immigrants, including California, Illinois, Kansas and Texas. Although there have been court challenges, the law has not been overturned in the states that have it.\par \par \uc2 Senate Bill 126 would allow \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students to qualify for in-state tuition if they meet certain criteria, such as attending a Colorado high school for at least three years and graduating from a state school.\par \par \uc2 It requires that students sign an affidavit with a college saying they are trying to obtain legal residency, a provision that other states have included in their legislation.\par \par \uc2 The latest Colorado bill is different from past versions because it makes \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students ineligible for a state stipend that in-state tuition students can use at a college of their choice. That means illegal immigrants would still pay more than others who get in-state tuition.\par \par \uc2 Republicans who opposed the bill said taxpayers would still be subsidizing college for illegal immigrants because having additional students will lead to higher operating costs -- an argument Democrats disputed.\par \par \uc2 Republicans also said the proposal would reward illegal behavior.\par \par \uc2 "We typically punish people who break the law," El Paso County Republican Sen. Bill Cadman said. "We're proving a singular exception for those who are breaking the law in this country."\par \par \uc2 Democratic Sen.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) - Neither tears, nor prayer nor opposition from influential business groups could sway a House committee that voted largely along party lines Thursday for a Republican-sponsored bill that would follow Arizona's lead and make illegal immigration a state crime in Florida.\par \par \uc2 That legislation and a similar Senate bill also would require employers to use a federal database to verify the immigration status of new hires.\par \par \uc2 While other opponents, some identifying themselves as undocumented immigrants, knelt in prayer and two young girls burst into tears, business lobbyists argued the legislation would hurt Florida's tourism and agriculture industries while reducing tax revenues.\par \par \uc2 "Just the mere consideration of this bill is causing the image of the state of Florida to be tarnished not only nationally but internationally," said Florida Chamber of Chamber Vice President Adam Babington. He said that "will have economic consequences."\par \par \uc2 It would scare off tourists from Latin American and the Caribbean who contribute billions to Florida's economy and millions to state coffers, Babington argued.\par \par \uc2 "Please do not make Florida employers immigration officials," pleaded Tom Stahl, executive director of Florida United Businesses Association. "We view it as regulation, which is somewhat ironic given the tenor of the Legislature this year."\par \par \uc2 Following the lead of Republican Gov. Rick Scott, the GOP-controlled Legislature has focused heavily making Florida friendlier to business including reductions in government regulations.\par \par \uc2 Others argued that Florida produce would rot in the fields without immigrants to pick the crops and that the bill would be unconstitutional because immigration is controlled by federal law.\par \par \uc2 Supporters said the legislation is needed because the federal government has failed to control the nation's borders and it would put pressure on Washington to fix that problem.\par \par \uc2 "Despite some of the rhetoric and the obfuscation that's gone on here today, the main fear is that businesses will lose their undocumented workers," said Rep. William Snyder, a Stuart Republican sponsoring the House bill.\par \par \uc2 "Somebody came up here and said we won't have tomatoes in our salad," Snyder added. "I would rather eat bread than eat something that was gleaned off the sweat of someone who has less rights than me."\par \par \uc2 The legislation is very personal for some who testified.\par \par \uc2 "I am undocumented, unapologetic and unafraid," said Jose Manuel Godinez-Samperio,\par \par \uc2 Now 24 and set to graduate next month from Florida State University's law school, he said his parents brought him illegally to the United States when he was 9 years old.\par \par \uc2 "This bill would totally shatter may dreams," said Godinez-Samperio. "I've been raised in this country. I speak just like you. I think just like you. I act just like you. Why?"\par \par \uc2 Kevin Lopez Gutierrez, a 17-year-old high school student from Indiantown, said his parents brought him illegally to the United States when he was 5 years old.\par \par \uc2 "I don't want to go back to Mexico cause I was raised here in the U.S.," he told the House panel. "I'm proud to say I'm an American, but I can't be; I'm illegal."\par \par \uc2 "We don't want you guys to separate our families from us," 10-year-old Karla Amaya of Clearwater told lawmakers before she and a young friend broke into tears.\par \par \uc2 Besides up to 20 days in jail and a $100 fine for a first offense, undocumented immigrants would face enhanced penalties if convicted of other crimes. Like Arizona's law, police could check someone's immigration status only if that person is under investigation for another criminal offense if there is a reasonable suspicion they're in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 The Florida legislation does not include Arizona provisions also requiring all immigrants to obtain or carry immigration registration papers and making it a state criminal offense for an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  to seek work or hold a job.\par \par \uc2 A study by the Pew Hispanic Center ranked Florida third among the states with an estimated 825,000 unauthorized immigrants, or 4.5 percent of the state's population, last year.\par \par \uc2 The House Economic Affairs Committee approved the bill (HB 7089) 11-7 with most Republicans in favor and most Democrats against. It next goes to the House floor. The Senate version (SB 2040) is awaiting a final committee hearing.\par \par \uc2 The legislation also has drawn opposition from Associated Industries of Florida, the Florida Fruit and Vegetable Association, farmworker advocates and Christian and Jewish clergy.\par \par \uc2 It's got the support, though, of Scott, who already has issued an executive order requiring state agencies and contractors to use the federal database when hiring.\par \par \uc2 "If people are in our country and violating the law then we ought to be able to ask if they're legal or not," Scott said.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110414e74e001h5\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) - South Carolina budget writers on Thursday turned to tax scofflaws to help patch the state's budget.\par \par \uc2 They've been a repeated target, but the twist this time? The crackdown would aim to collect from out-of-state tax cheats and help generate money to enforce the state's \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  laws and revive a mothballed Statehouse security system.\par \par \uc2 The Senate Finance Committee wrapped up work Thursday on a $5.8 billion spending plan. That includes more than $509 million in cash mostly from unneeded reserves, growing state surpluses, the tax crackdown and the state's increased cigarette tax.\par \par \uc2 The tax crackdown would give the state Department of Revenue $4 million to track down companies and individuals outside the state in an effort that "goes after the tax cheats -- and that's what they are," Senate Finance Committee Chairman Hugh Leatherman said. "I don't think that we've touched those people yet," the Florence Republican said.\par \par \uc2 The agency has promised the campaign would collect $80 million in unpaid tax revenue. Officials with the department did not immediately respond to an interview request to talk about its chances to deliver the amount of money expected by budget writers.\par \par \uc2 Gov. Nikki Haley, was aware of and approved the program, though she's not ready to comment on how the money is spent, Haley spokesman Rob Godfrey said.\par \par \uc2 "The governor has been very involved in the budget process thus far and will continue to be, and, given that the budget has just come out of Senate finance, we look forward to studying it," Godfrey said.\par \par \uc2 The spending plan adds $722,925 to the Department of Public Safety budget to cover 12 positions that will enforce the state's illegal immigration laws. That includes changes the Senate approved earlier this year that now are being discussed in the House Judiciary Committee. The legislation calls for a new "border patrol" unit.\par \par \uc2 The Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation also is directed to put $1.4 million into enforcing illegal immigration laws.\par \par \uc2 Legislators are looking for protection, too. The budget bill, scheduled for debate in two weeks, includes $900,000 to revive a Statehouse security system that Gov. Mark Sanford mothballed in 2009. That cash pays for 12 Department of Public Safety positions.\par \par \uc2 Sanford objected to tighter security at the Capitol, downplaying possible threats that legislators believe exist.\par \par \uc2 "I think we are sitting ducks here," Leatherman said.\par \par \uc2 The spending plan's extra cash is spread throughout state agencies and helps bolster state programs that, among other things, cover cancer screenings, the state's disabled and drugs for AIDS patients. For instance, cancer screenings pick up $2 million and the budget includes $5 million for the AIDS drug assistance program.\par \par \uc2 The largest chunk of the extra cash goes to state Medicaid programs, which pick up $214 million. Most of that comes from the state's increased cigarette tax.\par \par \uc2 Another large piece goes into public education programs. They pick up $128 million, with $97 million used to increase per student spending. The extra cash also includes $20 million used to help shield some school districts from losing money under the state's education funding formula.Major fights loom as the spending plan heads to the floor for debate where tea party-leaning Republicans will have a chance to cut spending.\par \par \uc2 For instance, Sen. Kevin Bryant, an Anderson Republican and pharmacist, said he'll again attempt to require HIV/AIDS and mental health patients on Medicaid to use generic drugs. "My principles have more support on the floor than in this committee," Bryant said. "We can't allow Medicaid to pay for brand names when the generic is available. That is a total, irresponsible worthless waste of money."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110414e74e000p1\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHOENIX (AP) - A federal appeals court on Monday refused to lift a stay blocking major parts of Arizona's immigration law from taking effect and said the federal government is likely to be able to prove the controversial law is unconstitutional.\par \par \uc2 The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals turned down an appeal filed by Gov. Jan Brewer. She had asked the appeals court to lift an injunction imposed by a federal judge in Phoenix the day before the law was to take effect on July 29, 2010.\par \par \uc2 The U.S Justice Department sued to block the law, saying it violates the U.S. Constitution because enforcing immigration law is a federal issue.\par \par \uc2 U.S. District Court Judge Susan Bolton issued an injunction preventing four major parts of the law from going into effect pending a trial. Monday's ruling by the three-judge appeals court panel upheld that injunction.\par \par \uc2 The panel's opinion said the government is likely to succeed in its arguments that Congress has given the federal government sole authority to enforce immigration laws, and that Arizona's law violates the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution. One judge dissented.\par \par \uc2 Brewer's lawyers said the federal government hasn't effectively enforced immigration law and that the state law will assist federal authorities.\par \par \uc2 "I remain steadfast in my belief that Arizona and other states have a sovereign right and obligation to protect their citizens and enforce immigration law in accordance with federal statute," Brewer said in a statement.\par \par \uc2 The governor's office said Brewer, Arizona Attorney General Tom Horne and their legal team -- in conjunction with counsel for the Arizona Legislature -- will be considering their legal options, including appealing to a larger 9th Circuit panel or seeking an immediate petition for the U.S. Supreme Court, to lift the injunction.\par \par \uc2 The bill's author, state Sen. Russell Pearce, issued a statement saying the appeals court ruling was "utterly predictable."\par \par \uc2 "SB 1070 is constitutionally sound, and that will be proven when the U.S. Supreme Court takes up this case and makes the proper ruling," he said. "This battle is a battle of epic proportions. It is about a state's right to enforce the laws of this land and protect its citizens from those who break our laws."\par \par \uc2 "We're obviously pleased with the ruling, but we understand that there could be a long way to go with this litigation," said Robby Sherwood, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney for Arizona.\par \par \uc2 Parts of the law blocked from taking effect while the case works its way through the courts include a provision requiring police to question people's immigration status while enforcing other laws if there is a reasonable suspicion they're in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 Other provisions that are on hold include: requiring all immigrants to obtain or carry immigration registration papers; making it a state criminal offense for an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  to seek work or hold a job; and allowing police to arrest suspected illegal immigrants without a warrant.\par \par \uc2 In a separate opinion concurring with the panel's ruling, Appeals Court Judge John T. Noonan noted the intent of the state statute is clear and goes beyond what federal law allows.\par \par \uc2 "If we read Section 1 of the statute, the statute states the purpose of providing a solution to illegal immigration in the United States. So read, the statute is a singular entry into the foreign policy of the United States by a single state," he wrote.\par \par \uc2 Judge Carlos Bea would uphold two of the provisions -- those allowing police to question people about their immigration status and to make warrantless arrests -- and wrote a pointed dissent.\par \par \uc2 "As I see it, Congress has clearly expressed its intention that state officials should assist federal officials in checking the immigration status of aliens," he wrote. He also included a footnote that quoted Lewis Carroll's "Alice in Wonderland" to criticize what he called the majority's convoluted reasoning.\par \par \uc2 The passage of SB 1070 last year reignited an immigration debate that has simmered in Arizona and across the nation for years.\par \par \uc2 Opponents of the law protested in the streets as it was about to take effect and called for a boycott of the state.\par \par \uc2 Proponents called the law a long-overdue effort by a state that has been overburdened by illegal immigration and a lack of federal action on the issue.\par \par \uc2 Opponents of the law hailed the decision and said other states considering similar legislation should take note.\par \par \uc2 "Today's decision rightly rejects SB 1070's assault on the core American values of fairness and equality," said Omar Jadwat, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union Immigrants' Rights Project. "Legislators in other states should pay close attention to today's ringing condemnation of Arizona's racial profiling law and refrain from going down the same unconstitutional path."\par \par \uc2 5\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110412e74c0004g\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Livingston County Daily Press & Argus. April 11, 2011\par \par \uc2 Corrections spending puts state in a bind\par \par \uc2 Michigan keeps prisoners behind bars longer on average than do neighboring states. We also spend more annually to keep an inmate in prison. This double whammy results in huge corrections spending, representing about one out of four dollars spent from the state's general fund. If Michigan's incarceration data were similar to neighboring states, that would free up money to be spent on public education, roads and social needs.\par \par \uc2 The state started ramping up its corrections spending in the 1970s as part of a "get tough on crime" movement. The spending has been aided by unrealistic drug laws. So the state borders on financial disaster while spending ever more on lengthy prison sentences that don't appear to have a positive effect on public safety.\par \par \uc2 Many think it's time for lawmakers to quit worrying about being painted as "soft on crime," and instead look at reasonable, cost-saving measures that will bring Michigan in line with neighboring states, while freeing up money for better causes.\par \par \uc2 That's the gist of the following editorial, which we are reprinting from the Lansing State Journal.\par \par \uc2 Michigan must start applying reason to its spending on prisoners. There is simply no other option. With a Corrections Department budget of $2 billion -- some 25 percent of the state's general fund -- the problem is too urgent to ignore.\par \par \uc2 The Associated Press reports that 8,000 of the state's 44,000 inmates have served longer than their minimum sentence, costing the state some $280 million per year. In part, that's because Michigan keeps nonviolent offenders behind bars longer than other states. On average, Michigan prisoners serve 140 percent of their minimum sentence.\par \par \uc2 Ultimately, a prisoner here with a five-year sentence is likely to serve seven years, although research shows those extra years don't impact recidivism.\par \par \uc2 Adding to the problem, Michigan's prison costs are $35,000 per inmate per year, while other Great Lakes states spend thousands less.\par \par \uc2 At the same time, other states have similar minimum sentences to those used here, but release inmates at their minimum sentence or sooner because credits are allowed for good behavior.\par \par \uc2 Michigan, in contrast, did away with such "good time" credits years ago, choosing truth-in-sentencing policies that enforce a minimum sentence.\par \par \uc2 The reality is that Michigan chooses to keep prisoners longer than necessary as a matter of politics, not because it's good public policy. It's no longer practical or sustainable to do so.\par \par \uc2 Truly violent offenders do need to stay behind bars longer. But nonviolent offenders need a constructive path back into society, where they can work and contribute taxes rather than draining the state's coffers for an extra year or two because it's politically expedient to be "tough on crime."\par \par \uc2 There are steps that could be taken to get off this expensive and ineffective path.\par \par \uc2 Bills have been introduced in the past that would keep all but violent offenders from serving more than 120 percent of their minimum sentences. Alternately, Rep. Mark Meadows, D-East Lansing, suggests exploring a certain sentence rather than a range of years, a practice he says has been used to control costs elsewhere.\par \par \uc2 Gov. Rick Snyder has focused on taxation and the economy, leaving the Department of Corrections battle for another year. Michigan can't wait much longer. The state can't continue spending $2 billion per year on Corrections while cutting education and other services.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 The Daily Telegram (Adrian). April 10, 2011\par \par \uc2 Transferring K-12 money to colleges is the wrong move\par \par \uc2 With Michigan facing a massive budget shortfall next year, it's no wonder state lawmakers are scrambling for money. But Gov. Rick Snyder's plan to divert $900 million from K-12 education results in too deep a cut, at a time when a good educational system is more important than ever.\par \par \uc2 We have no beef, in principle, with what Snyder plans to do with the money. It would be used for community colleges and state universities, both of which are important -- and using the school aid fund for higher education is perfectly legal. (The state constitution designates it for "aid to school districts, higher education, and school employees' retirement systems.")\par \par \uc2 But there are several important differences between colleges and K-12 schools that we feel make the transfer -- and the $470-per-pupil cut in state aid that it would bring about -- an unwise move at this time.\par \par \uc2 -- First, public school districts are far more dependent on state aid. A chart on the University of Michigan's website shows that, in 2007-08, 62 percent of the school's general fund came from student fees and only 24 percent from the state. By contrast, school districts are almost completely dependent on the state's per-pupil foundation allowance. The only exceptions are categorical money such as special education and at-risk funds, which are extremely limited in how they can be spent, and special millages, which can be used for buses, technology or building projects, but cannot be used to pay teachers or keep the buildings heated.\par \par \uc2 -- Second, while universities and community colleges will play an important role in economic recovery by training people for tomorrow's jobs, adults attending college have more options than K-12 students. Just as colleges can increase fees, students can secure loans to help pay tuition -- or even postpone college while they work and save money. But student loans cannot restore excellence to a school district that's been forced to cut to the bone, and students can't postpone kindergarten. When it comes to giving students a solid K-12 education, we only have one shot.\par \par \uc2 -- Finally, we cannot forget that, as important as a college education is, our K-12 schools are what give students a solid foundation for higher learning. Colleges may have the most immediate impact on our workforce, but if we fail today's kindergartners, we will pay the price down the road.\par \par \uc2 Snyder has noted, correctly, that schools could soften the blow of his proposed cuts if teachers started paying 20 percent of their insurance costs. We suspect there is plenty of room to save money on health care while still providing benefits that most people would consider more than adequate. Similarly, more school boards need to consider the sensible but politically difficult idea of district consolidation. Perhaps Snyder is figuring that deep cuts are the only way to push schools to make unpopular changes to their cost structures.\par \par \uc2 But even if districts share services and switch to less expensive insurance providers, the savings are unlikely to add up to enough to offset the proposed cuts. Even if some money is diverted, Snyder should consider a much smaller shift of funds to minimize cuts that would harm students' educations. We shouldn't fund colleges at the expense of the schools that will prepare students for college in the first place.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 The Grand Rapids Press. April 7, 2011\par \par \uc2 Lawmakers should crack down on Michigan unemployment overpayments, fraud\par \par \uc2 In this economy, or frankly any time, the state can't afford to pass up savings opportunities. Revelations in a report by the auditor general's office that the Unemployment Insurance Agency has shelled out tens of millions in overpayments and failed to assess hundreds of millions in fraud-related claims is unacceptable. Gov. Rick Snyder and lawmakers should see to it that the agency implements the sensible ideas recommended.\par \par \uc2 The agency, part of the Department of Energy, Labor and Economic Growth, is charged with collecting state unemployment taxes from employers and paying state and federal unemployment insurance benefits to "eligible" claimants. The audit, which covers Oct. 1, 2007 to Sept. 20, 2010, concludes agency efforts to prevent, detect and recover unemployment insurance benefit overpayments were not effective.\par \par \uc2 Effectiveness and efficiency are basic to successful management. But the report cites up to $72.5 million in overpayments that the agency failed to identify and pursue recovering. In addition, fraud-related penalties ranging from between $120 million and $236.6 million were not even assessed.\par \par \uc2 Those who receive unemployment benefits through fraud can face restitution penalties of up to 400 percent for overpayments above $500. And they should have to.\par \par \uc2 The unemployment system owes the federal government $3.8 billion in loans it needed to cover jobless benefits. Prolonged high unemployment led to the system depleting its funding reserves. Unemployment, now at 10.7 percent, had soared to its peak of 14.1 percent in August and September 2009. That's why the possible loss of as much as nearly $237 million is so disturbing.\par \par \uc2 This year, the interest on the federal loans is estimated at $117 million. The agency must improve its overpayment identification efforts to help repay the loans.\par \par \uc2 The report also states the agency may have spent up to $1.4 million on payments to workers who had died because it had not established and implemented procedures to identify and recover benefits improperly paid to deceased claimants. And because the agency failed to ensure \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  claimants met federal and state eligibility requirements, it potentially paid up to $7.9 million to 1,201 ineligible illegal claimants.\par \par \uc2 The pursuit of governmental savings and efficiency is paramount for all state agencies. Lawmakers are grappling with yet another budget crisis. Based on Gov. Rick Snyder's proposed budget, the Senate Fiscal Agency projects a $1.4 billion deficit in fiscal year 2012. The state needs to corral every dollar of revenue.\par \par \uc2 The agency agreed with 13 of the audit's recommendations, and partially agreed with one other. The state paid $15.4 billion in unemployment insurance benefits in the three-year period ending Sept. 30, 2010, that was covered by the audit and reported overpayment recoveries totaling $89.7 million from 2007 through 2009.\par \par \uc2 A few of the common sense ideas put forth to the Unemployment Insurance Agency by auditors include:\par \par \uc2 -- Improve controls to help ensure the agency correctly classifies claimants who intentionally misrepresent or conceal facts to obtain unemployment benefits.\par \par \uc2 -- Recover overpayments and associated penalties related to those who receive benefits for which they are ineligible.\par \par \uc2 -- Consistently verify all claimants' identities with the Social Security Administration, and document and timely complete its claimant identify verification efforts.\par \par \uc2 -- Establish and implement procedures to identify and recover benefits improperly paid to the deceased.\par \par \uc2 -- Properly investigate and document investigations of potential false claims identified in cross matches of new hire databases.\par \par \uc2 These suggestions could bring more money into the public coffers. Improving effectiveness and inefficiency and implementing procedures for identifying and fixing errors that cost the state money must be the agency's focus. Lawmakers should see to that on behalf of taxpayers.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Kalamazoo Gazette. April 10, 2011\par \par \uc2 More legislation is not the answer to the growing methamphetamine problem in Michigan\par \par \uc2 Six years ago we reported, wrote and published an eight-part series, "The Menace of Meth." People reacted, new laws were written and funding was found to fight methamphetamine, a drug that had taken hold in southwestern Michigan because of the relative ease and cheapness of its production.\par \par \uc2 For a little while, it looked as though we'd won the war.\par \par \uc2 It was a premature celebration. Today, the drug is easier to manufacture, although no less dangerous, and it has become an even greater problem in Michigan with 756 meth incidents statewide in 2010, according to a report we published recently.\par \par \uc2 Once again, lawmakers and law enforcers are looking for answers. State Rep. Matt Lori, R-Constantine, and a former St. Joseph County sheriff, said he plans to follow the lead of Oregon and Mississippi and introduce legislation that would require a doctor's prescription for anyone who wanted to buy a medicine containing pseudoephedrine, an important ingredient in the production of meth.\par \par \uc2 Several states are looking at similar legislation. Not surprisingly, the pharmaceutical industry is fighting these attempts. Pseudoephedrine is an ingredient in cold and allergy medicines to help relieve congestion. Sales of over-the-counter drugs containing the ingredient exceed $550 million a year. Prescription-only legislation has been defeated in Arkansas, Kansas, Kentucky and West Virginia.\par \par \uc2 But our concern is that more legislation would serve to treat symptoms -- temporarily -- and not the disease.\par \par \uc2 In 2005, Michigan, along with the several other states and the federal government, passed laws restricting the amount of over-the-counter medications containing pseudoephedrine that could be purchased at one time. Efforts were also made to make it harder for meth "cooks" to get another ingredient - anhydrous ammonia.\par \par \uc2 To get around the restrictions, meth users would store hop, buying the legal limit at several stores. A one-pot method of manufacturing the drug was also developed. The one thing that hasn't changed is the volatility of the drug. The manufacturing process can easily go wrong, resulting in explosions, death and injury.\par \par \uc2 And taxpayers are footing the bill for the injuries as makers and users of meth seldom carry health insurance. Bronson Methodist Hospital treated 17 patients burned in meth mishaps last year at an average of $130,000 per patient. Clean-up costs are also a problem. Counties had been using federal funds to get rid of the hazardous waste which results from meth operations, but those funds dried up in February, according to Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller.\par \par \uc2 We all want to see methamphetamine use decrease, but new laws will only deter, not stop, drug seekers. Laws already exist restricting many narcotics to prescription only and yet the illegal trade in pills containing opiates like oxycontin and vicodin is flourishing. So much so that billboards are up all over Kalamazoo warning parents to keep their prescription drugs locked up.\par \par \uc2 The real answer to the meth problem won't be found in a legislative quick fix. Meth use is a sign of addiction. The drug is cheap and easy to make or acquire. It gives the user the ability to feel as if nothing else matters. The reasons people begin using meth and other drugs are many and complicated, but often involve the inability to cope with problems or growing up in an environment where drug use is normal.\par \par \uc2 Solving the meth problem involves working with the mental health, substance abuse and legal system to combat the causes of drug abuse. If legislators want to help, they can make sure funding for treatment programs and drug courts stays intact.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110411e74b0043l\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHOENIX (AP) - A federal appeals court on Monday refused to lift a stay blocking major parts of Arizona's immigration law from taking effect and said the federal government is likely to be able to prove the controversial law is unconstitutional.\par \par \uc2 The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals turned down an appeal filed by Gov. Jan Brewer. She had asked the appeals court to lift an injunction imposed by a federal judge in Phoenix the day before the law was to take effect on July 29, 2010.\par \par \uc2 The U.S Justice Department sued to block the law, saying it violates the U.S. Constitution because enforcing immigration law is a federal issue.\par \par \uc2 U.S. District Court Judge Susan Bolton issued an injunction preventing four major parts of the law from going into effect pending a trial. Monday's ruling by the three-judge appeals court panel upheld that injunction.\par \par \uc2 The panel's opinion said the government is likely to succeed in its arguments that Congress has given the federal government sole authority to enforce immigration laws, and that Arizona's law violates the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution. One judge dissented.\par \par \uc2 Brewer's lawyers said the federal government hasn't effectively enforced immigration law and that the state law will assist federal authorities.\par \par \uc2 "I remain steadfast in my belief that Arizona and other states have a sovereign right and obligation to protect their citizens and enforce immigration law in accordance with federal statute," Brewer said in a statement.\par \par \uc2 The Governor's Office said Brewer, Arizona Attorney General Tom Horne and their legal team -- in conjunction with counsel for the Arizona Legislature -- will be considering their legal options including appealing to a larger 9th Circuit panel or seeking an immediate petition for the U.S. Supreme Court to lift the injunction.\par \par \uc2 The bill's author, state Sen. Russell Pearce, issued a statement saying the appeals court ruling was "utterly predictable."\par \par \uc2 "SB 1070 is constitutionally sound, and that will be proven when the U.S. Supreme Court takes up this case and makes the proper ruling," he said. "This battle is a battle of epic proportions. It is about a state's right to enforce the laws of this land and protect its citizens from those who break our laws."\par \par \uc2 The Justice Department did not immediately comment.\par \par \uc2 Parts of the law blocked from taking effect while the case works its way through the courts include a provision requiring police to question people's immigration status while enforcing other laws if there is a reasonable suspicion they're in the country illegally. Other provisions that are on hold include: requiring all immigrants to obtain or carry immigration registration papers; making it a state criminal offense for an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  to seek work or hold a job; and allowing police to arrest suspected illegal immigrants without a warrant.\par \par \uc2 In a separate opinion concurring with the panel's ruling, Appeals Court Judge John T. Noonan noted the intent of the state statute is clear and goes beyond what federal law allows.\par \par \uc2 "If we read Section 1 of the statute, the statute states the purpose of providing a solution to illegal immigration in the United States. So read, the statute is a singular entry into the foreign policy of the United States by a single state," he wrote.\par \par \uc2 Judge Carlos Bea would uphold two of the provisions -- those allowing police to question people about their immigration status and to make warrantless arrests -- and wrote a pointed dissent.\par \par \uc2 "As I see it, Congress has clearly expressed its intention that state officials should assist federal officials in checking the immigration status of aliens," he wrote. He also included a footnote that quoted Lewis Carroll's "Alice in Wonderland" to criticize what he called the majority's convoluted reasoning.\par \par \uc2 The passage of SB 1070 last year reignited an immigration debate that has simmered in Arizona and across the nation for years.\par \par \uc2 Opponents of the law protested in the streets as it was about to take effect and called for a boycott of the state.\par \par \uc2 Proponents called the law a long-overdue effort by a state that has been overburdened by illegal immigration and a lack of federal action on the issue.\par \par \uc2 Opponents of the law hailed the decision and said other states considering similar legislation should take note.\par \par \uc2 "Today's decision rightly rejects SB 1070's assault on the core American values of fairness and equality," said Omar Jadwat, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union Immigrants' Rights Project. "Legislators in other states should pay close attention to today's ringing condemnation of Arizona's racial profiling law and refrain from going down the same unconstitutional path."\par \par \uc2 5\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110411e74b003ma\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHOENIX (AP) - Armed with a new computer program, the Arizona Department of Revenue is cracking down on tax fraud this year.\par \par \uc2 And although administrators say illegal immigrants aren't the target, they're likely to be the majority of those caught up in the effort.\par \par \uc2 People whose federal tax-identification number doesn't match the information provided on their W-2 form will not get their refund unless they can prove they are the ones who did the work.\par \par \uc2 One tax preparer told The Arizona Republic that the effort will hurt the Hispanic community.\par \par \uc2 "It's money they earned through the sweat of their labor," said Carlos Maldonado, a Phoenix resident who prepares tax forms for Spanish speakers. "The government is keeping money that doesn't belong to it."\par \par \uc2 The state and federal Internal Revenue Service encourage illegal immigrants to file income-tax forms and comply with tax laws, which apply to individuals who earn revenue in the United States regardless of their legal status.\par \par \uc2 In Arizona, where it's a crime to knowingly hire an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , those immigrants will often work using either a fake Social Security number or one that belongs to someone else. Their employer puts that Social Security number on their W-2 form.\par \par \uc2 For tax filing, illegal immigrants -- or anyone in the United States legally who isn't eligible for a Social Security number -- must apply to the IRS for an Individual Tax Identification Number. They then file taxes under that number.\par \par \uc2 The Arizona Department of Revenue's new program will check all tax documents filed with tax ID numbers to make sure any listed Social Security number and the tax ID number both belong to the employee named. If they don't, the state will send out a letter asking the employee to prove he or she is the one who actually did the work.\par \par \uc2 Anthony Forschino, assistant director at the Department of Revenue, said about 60,000 Arizona residents filed taxes last year using a tax ID number, resulting in about $6 million in refunds.\par \par \uc2 He said the state sampled a "pretty good portion" of those returns and found that in 80 to 85 percent of them, the ID number did not match information provided on an associated W-2.\par \par \uc2 This year, the new program will allow them to go through all the returns.\par \par \uc2 "We have a responsibility to try and stop fraudulent returns," Forschino said. "There are people that, and we have found this in the past, who tried to create a W-2 that doesn't even exist or stole somebody's W-2 and tried to get a refund."\par \par \uc2 Forschino said they want to give refunds to those who earned them, regardless of legal status. He said his department is still trying to work out the details of the crackdown, particularly what sort of documentation an individual could show to prove he or she is the one who did the work and paid the taxes.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Information from: The Arizona Republic, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.azcentral.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.azcentral.com}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110409e74900409\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

House passes bill to allow in-state tuition for illegal immigrants who meet conditions\b0\par\par\uc2 By BRIAN WITTE   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 653 \uc2 words\par \uc2 8 April 2011\par 18:57\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2011.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) - As many southern states pass news laws to crack down on illegal immigrants, the Maryland General Assembly on Friday moved toward allowing them to pay in-state college tuition, if they meet certain conditions.\par \par \uc2 The Maryland House voted 74-66 on Friday for the measure after intense debate. The Senate already has passed similar legislation.\par \par \uc2 Democratic supporters say the legislation would create opportunity for people who have lived in Maryland for years and paid state taxes.\par \par \uc2 "It gives them an opportunity to become a productive member of our society, and I believe that's what we all want," said Delegate Aisha Braveboy, D-Prince George's. "There are limitless opportunities in the future, and I want all children to have that."\par \par \uc2 But Republican opponents said the measure rewards illegal behavior at taxpayers' expense, while filling up seats at the state's colleges that could be filled with citizens who are struggling to find work in a tough economy.\par \par \uc2 "I don't think any American should have to compete with someone here illegally for a job, and I don't think we should be offering an enticement for a person to come here illegally, and that's exactly what we're doing," said Delegate Herb McMillan, R-Anne Arundel.\par \par \uc2 Illegal immigrants would have to complete two years at a community college and show that their parents paid state income taxes for the three years before they enrolled to qualify for in-state tuition. The proposal is aimed at those who may have come to the U.S. illegally as children with their parents and may have lived most of their life in the U.S. Someone who is born in the U.S. to illegal immigrants is automatically a citizen.\par \par \uc2 The Legislature adjourns Monday night, and the two chambers will have to work out some differences for the measure to go to Gov. Martin O'Malley, a Democrat who has said he will sign it.\par \par \uc2 The House added an amendment that would require male illegal immigrants to register with the Selective Service, or the draft, before qualifying for the reduced tuition rate. The House also changed the definition of an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  receiving the reduced tuition rate to have him or her count as part of a school's out-of-state student pool, keeping preventing in-state slots for Maryland residents from being unaffected.\par \par \uc2 On Friday, the House also changed the bill so that parents would have to produce evidence they paid Maryland income taxes 90 days out of each of the three years. Delegate Luiz Simmons, D-Montgomery, who offered the amendment, included an exception for parents who were unable to meet the requirement if they experienced "serious and substantial circumstances," such as an injury.\par \par \uc2 Delegate Anthony O'Donnell, R-Calvert, said the change created "substantial loopholes."\par \par \uc2 "All you have to do is say, 'Circumstances beyond my control. I couldn't provide the documentation and I couldn't pay taxes,' and you can drive a Greyhound bus through this loophole," O'Donnell said.\par \par \uc2 The Democrat-controlled House of Delegates rejected a Republican-backed amendment that would have capped the amount of money for illegal immigrants getting the lower tuition rate at $1 million a year. A proposal to cap it at $3 million a year also was rejected. Democrats also shot down an amendment that would have required a one-time $250 fee from a student to receive the reduced benefit.\par \par \uc2 The financial implications for students are significant. In-state tuition is $8,416 annually, and out-of-state students pay $24,831 a year.\par \par \uc2 Since 2001, 10 states have enacted laws to allow illegal immigrants to pay in-state tuition rates at public universities. They are California, Illinois, Kansas, Nebraska, New York, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah and Washington.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110408e748003db\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

(AP) - An Alabama Senate committee has taken a slightly different approach to illegal immigration than the House.\par \par \uc2 The Senate Job Creation and Economic Development Committee voted 9-1 Thursday for an illegal immigration bill sponsored by Republican Sen. Scott Beason of Gardendale. Beason said his bill is similar to one already approved by the House because it makes it a crime to conceal or knowingly transport an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . But the difference is that his bill doesn't require employers to check new employees' legal status through the federal E-Verify computer system. Beason said his bill leaves it up to employers to use whatever method they want to make sure they are hiring legal workers.\par \par \uc2 Beason's bill now goes to the Senate for consideration.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110408e748001rz\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 LOS ANGELES (AP) - The federal government on Thursday agreed to pay $1.95 million to settle a lawsuit with the family of a now-deceased \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who was denied medical care for cancer in detention.\par \par \uc2 Salvadoran immigrant Francisco Castaneda was denied a biopsy for a painful lesion for 11 months while in the custody of federal immigration authorities from March 2006 to February 2007. He was later diagnosed with penile cancer and died in 2008 at age 36.\par \par \uc2 Under the settlement, Castaneda's 18-year-old daughter will receive roughly $550,000. The rest will go to Castaneda's estate and to cover attorneys' fees and costs. The lawsuit filed by his relatives was settled in federal court in Los Angeles.\par \par \uc2 Conal Doyle, the family's attorney, said the settlement is about eight times the cap placed on medical damages in California.\par \par \uc2 "It is certainly a recognition by the federal government that every human life has great value," Doyle said. "It was very significant in light of the limitations we faced if the case went to trial."\par \par \uc2 Immigration and Customs Enforcement said in a statement that the agency deeply regrets that Castaneda was not diagnosed and treated promptly. Officials also said changes have been made to let detainees' doctors make treatment decisions without waiting for approval from headquarters in Washington.\par \par \uc2 Castaneda was convicted of drug possession in 2005 and spent more than a year in state and federal detention facilities. He complained of a painful lesion on his penis but was never given a biopsy, even though it had been ordered by his doctors. He was given pain pills and clean boxer shorts every day, but his condition worsened.\par \par \uc2 Castaneda was released from immigration custody in February 2007, just days before a biopsy was finally scheduled and after the American Civil Liberties Union wrote letters to ICE demanding he be treated, court records show.\par \par \uc2 Castaneda went to the hospital and was diagnosed with cancer. Less than a week later, his penis was amputated. A year later, he died.\par \par \uc2 Castaneda's relatives sued the state and federal government. A jury last year determined state prisons were partly to blame for his death and awarded the family $1.73 million.\par \par \uc2 The federal lawsuit went to the Supreme Court after the family initially sued U.S. medical personnel for denying the biopsy. The government argued its medical personnel are immune from lawsuits, and the Supreme Court agreed last year.\par \par \uc2 The settlement entered into court Thursday ends the family's claims against the federal government. Relatives still have claims pending against two state medical officials, Doyle said.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110407e747003jy\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 KETCHUM, Idaho (AP) - A judge has denied a new trial for a woman convicted of killing her parents when she was a teenager and sentenced to two life terms in prison without the possibility of parole.\par \par \uc2 Fifth District Court Judge G. Richard Bevan on Monday ruled that 24-year-old Sarah Johnson did not have ineffective legal counsel at her 2005 trial.\par \par \uc2 Bevan also ruled in the 94-page decision that new fingerprint evidence brought forward after her conviction wasn't sufficient to order a new trial. The defense had argued that the fingerprint evidence on the rifle used to kill Alan and Diane Johnson suggested Johnson wasn't the killer.\par \par \uc2 "All her claims were denied in total, so it looks like the state and justice prevailed," Blaine County Prosecuting Attorney Jim Thomas told the Idaho Mountain Express.\par \par \uc2 Hailey attorney Christopher Simms has represented Johnson after being appointed by the court in the post-conviction-relief proceedings, and said they'll appeal the ruling.\par \par \uc2 Johnson was convicted in 2005 of pulling the trigger on a .264-caliber rifle, first killing her mother as she lay in bed in the early morning hours, then turning the weapon on her father as he exited the shower in their Bellevue home. Prosecutors said Johnson killed her parents on Sept. 3, 2003, after fighting with them over her boyfriend, Bruno Santos, a 19-year-old \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Mexico who was living in the region.\par \par \uc2 Bevan heard testimony at a four-day court hearing in Twin Falls in December on whether Johnson deserved a new trial. The Idaho attorney general's office represented the state.\par \par \uc2 In previous court action, the Idaho Supreme Court in June 2008 denied Johnson's request for exoneration or a new trail. The U.S. Supreme Court later that year declined to hear the case.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Information from: Idaho Mountain Express, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.mtexpress.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.mtexpress.com}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110406e746002i6\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

(AP) -- After seeing \uc2 Facebook\uc2  pleas and flash mobs, and even cities temporarily renaming themselves "\uc2 Google\uc2 ," the search engine giant said Wednesday it has chosen Kansas City, Kan., as the first place that will get its new ultra-fast broadband network.\par \par \uc2 Google\uc2  announced that the city would be the inaugural site for its "Fiber for Communities" program, which it says will be capable of delivering Internet access more than 100 times faster than the home broadband connections provided by phone and cable companies across the U.S.\par \par \uc2 The company envisions systems that will let consumers to download a high-definition, full-length feature film in less than five minutes, allow rural health clinics to send 3-D medical images over the Internet and let students collaborate with classmates around the world while watching live 3-D video of a university lecture.\par \par \uc2 Google\uc2 's service, which will provide Internet connections of 1 gigabit per second to as many as 500,000 people, will be offered in early 2012 while the company looks at other communities across the country.\par \par \uc2 More than 1,100 cities had made bids to become a test site for the company's fiber-optic network, trying to catch \uc2 Google\uc2 's attention and show their enthusiasm.\par \par \uc2 Milo Medin, \uc2 Google\uc2 's vice president for access services, said Kansas City, Kan., was selected in part because of its solid network infrastructure and because the program would have an impact on the community, one of the poorest in the state.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Kansas City woman accused of running adoption scam\par \par \uc2 KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- A Kansas City woman is accused of faking pregnancy and conning prospective adoptive parents out of thousands of dollars after being secretly videotaped by a national news outlet investigating the apparent scam.\par \par \uc2 Roxanne Janel Jones, 34, is charged in Johnson County, Kan., with two counts of theft and one count of identity theft. She was arrested March 15 after a CBS News producer posing as a mother looking to adopt interviewed her in a Kansas City-area hotel room.\par \par \uc2 Overland Park Police Detective Dennis Reaser, a financial crimes investigator with the department and a member of a Secret Service financial crimes task force, said authorities are looking for others who might have been taken in by Jones' story about being pregnant with twins but unable to afford to raise them.\par \par \uc2 "We are seeking to identify victims or individuals with information pertaining to adoption scams by birth mothers in the Kansas City area," he told The Associated Press. "The big thing is to identify other victims."\par \par \uc2 Jones is accused of scamming more than $1,000 but less than $25,000 from a Leavenworth, Kan., couple and items worth less than $1,000 from Christian Family Services, an Overland Park, Kan., agency that helps women complete their pregnancies or connect with families for legal adoption. She's also charged with obtaining someone else's Social Security number.\par \par \uc2 She was being held in Johnson County Jail on $25,000 bond and was scheduled to for an initial court appearance Thursday. Her public defender could not immediately be reached for comment Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Brownback makes case for Kansas budget\par \par \uc2 TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) -- Gov. Sam Brownback said Republicans need to pass a 2012 Kansas budget now, even if it lacks all the cuts or spending that many would like.\par \par \uc2 During a hastily called meeting Wednesday evening, the GOP governor commended House Republicans for their progress on a host of issues but said they need to move on getting the budget finished. The new fiscal year starts July 1.\par \par \uc2 "I do need your support to get this done now," Brownback said to the 92-member GOP caucus. "We have to do this and we have to show the people of Kansas we can govern. We have to show we can govern as a party."\par \par \uc2 House members are considering a proposed $14 billion budget that would create an ending balance of some $80 million. Senators approved their version Tuesday with about $8 million in reserves.\par \par \uc2 Brownback said he didn't speak to the House caucus out of a sense that the budget process was in trouble. He also said he wasn't picking sides between the House and Senate versions.\par \par \uc2 The Senate plan comes closest to the governor's own proposal, which would eliminate a $493 million budget shortfall and save about $7.5 million. Brownback said Kansas had to get its fiscal affairs in order, and developing the right policies takes time.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Former KU ticket employee sentenced to prison\par \par \uc2 WICHITA, Kan. (AP) -- A former University of Kansas systems analyst was sentenced Wednesday to 37 months in prison for her role in a $2 million ticket scalping conspiracy.\par \par \uc2 Kassie Liebsch broke into tears as the judge handed down the prison term the government had requested, rather than the probationary sentence her defense attorney sought.\par \par \uc2 Attorney David Bell tried to comfort Liebsch as U.S. District Judge Wesley Brown also ordered her to pay, along with her co-conspirators, $2 million in forfeiture and $1.27 million in restitution. Liebsch also was ordered to pay $79,863 to the Internal Revenue Service for the unreported income from the theft.\par \par \uc2 Liebsch pleaded guilty in January to a single count of conspiracy to defraud the United States through wire fraud, tax obstruction and interstate transportation of stolen property.\par \par \uc2 She told the court Wednesday that she began working at the University of Kansas at age 18 and that the first time former assistant athletics director Rodney Jones handed her cash, she tried to justify it as evidence of his generosity. But by the second and third time she got money she knew what was going on.\par \par \uc2 "I am upset with myself I was not stronger," Liebsch said.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Kan. grocer's legal woes compounded by new charges\par \par \uc2 WICHITA, Kan. (AP) -- A Wichita grocery store owner accused of trading cash for customers' food stamps saw his legal woes compounded this week when he was charged with knowingly hiring an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 An indictment made public Wednesday against Ahmed Ajami Al-Maleki, owner of the Kansas Food Market, alleges that he had been paying an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  in cash and began paying her with a business check after he was charged earlier this month in the food stamp fraud case.\par \par \uc2 "The Feds love (to) throw as much limp spaghetti as they can at the wall hoping something will stick," his defense attorney, Kurt Kerns, said in an email. "He is as innocent now as he was when they tossed the first limp noodle."\par \par \uc2 The new indictment alleges that Al-Maleki paid the woman's wages with a check after he was charged in the initial case, and the check had no withholdings for state and federal income taxes or Social Security. Al-Maleki cashed the check after the woman could not do so at a bank without proper identification, according to the indictment.\par \par \uc2 U.S. Attorney's Office spokesman Jim Cross said Al-Maleki has not been arrested on the new charges and prosecutors are working with his attorney to set a date for a court hearing.\par \par \uc2 The 40-year-old Wichita man has been free on bond since he was indicted March 1 on charges of conspiracy to defraud the Department of Agriculture, wire fraud and food stamp fraud. The department runs the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which distributes benefits commonly known as food stamps though they're now distributed through electronic fund transfer cards. The government is also seeking forfeiture of $130,000.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Kan. House advances bill limiting abortion clinics\par \par \uc2 TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) -- Kansas' House gave first-round approval Wednesday to a bill that would impose greater restrictions on abortion clinics -- a move opponents said continues a march toward restricting women's health care choices.\par \par \uc2 The bill imposes specific health and safety standards on abortion clinics, and would require an unannounced inspection by the Kansas Department of Health and Environment.\par \par \uc2 "This is a move to make it harder and more difficult for a woman to obtain a legal medical procedure," said Rep. Judith Loganbill, a Wichita Democrat. "I know this won't fail, but I sure hope you consider long and hard before you push a green button."\par \par \uc2 "It's more a pro-women's health bill," said Rep. Steve Huebert, a Valley Center Republican.\par \par \uc2 The measure is similar to legislation that previous governors, including Democratic Govs. Kathleen Sebelius and Mark Parkinson, have vetoed. This year's version advanced to final House action on a voice vote. Passage Thursday would send the bill to the Senate for consideration.\par \par \uc2 On Tuesday, lawmakers sent Republican Gov. Sam Brownback bills requiring minor girls to get parental consent for abortions, and restricting abortions after the 21st week. He's expected to sign both measures, keeping a promise he made in his State of the State address to approve legislation "establishing a culture of life in Kansas."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Kansas Senate confirms SRS chief despite criticism\par \par \uc2 TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) -- Republican Gov. Sam Brownback's top social services appointee easily won Kansas Senate confirmation Wednesday as a bipartisan majority brushed aside strong criticism from the chamber's top Democrat.\par \par \uc2 The vote was 34-1 on Social and Rehabilitation Services Secretary Rob Siedlecki's appointment and allows him to continue serving in the Cabinet position he's held since January, when Brownback took office.\par \par \uc2 Republicans hold a 32-8 majority in the Senate. As a group, they didn't appear to have serious misgivings about Siedlecki's appointment when Senate Minority Leader Anthony Hensley, a Topeka Democrat, questioned Siedlecki's fitness for the job. Half the Democrats also voted for the SRS secretary.\par \par \uc2 Hensley has alleged that Siedlecki intends to ignore the Legislature's wishes on the budget to finance initiatives he and Brownback favor. Siedlecki insists that's not true and Brownback stands by him.\par \par \uc2 "Thirty-five years of instinct -- you know, being in this process -- tell me that this guy is incapable of being able to run an agency of this size, and I quite frankly will just wait to see what kind of performance he has," said Hensley, the Legislature's longest-serving member. "I think this guy is in over his head."\par \par \uc2 The governor said Siedlecki is fully qualified, having served as a high-ranking Florida Department of Health official and in the U.S. Justice and Health and Human Services departments under Republican President George W. Bush.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110331e73v0023h\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WICHITA, Kan. (AP) - A Wichita grocery store owner accused of trading cash for customers' food stamps saw his legal woes compounded this week when he was charged with knowingly hiring an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 An indictment made public Wednesday against Ahmed Ajami Al-Maleki, owner of the Kansas Food Market, alleges that he had been paying an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  in cash and began paying her with a business check after he was charged earlier this month in the food stamp fraud case.\par \par \uc2 "The Feds love (to) throw as much limp spaghetti as they can at the wall hoping something will stick," his defense attorney, Kurt Kerns, said in an email. "He is as innocent now as he was when they tossed the first limp noodle."\par \par \uc2 The new indictment alleges that Al-Maleki paid the woman's wages with a check after he was charged in the initial case, and the check had no withholdings for state and federal income taxes or Social Security. Al-Maleki cashed the check after the woman could not do so at a bank without proper identification, according to the indictment.\par \par \uc2 U.S. Attorney's Office spokesman Jim Cross said Al-Maleki has not been arrested on the new charges and prosecutors are working with his attorney to set a date for a court hearing.\par \par \uc2 The 40-year-old Wichita man has been free on bond since he was indicted March 1 on charges of conspiracy to defraud the Department of Agriculture, wire fraud and food stamp fraud. The department runs the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which distributes benefits commonly known as food stamps though they're now distributed through electronic fund transfer cards. The government is also seeking forfeiture of $130,000.\par \par \uc2 Kansas Food Market is one of two stores caught up in a government crackdown in Wichita on people who sell their food stamp benefits for cash. The owners of the two stores are accused of paying the same runner to scour homeless shelters and other places looking for people willing to sell their benefits. Thirteen people have been charged in connection with the scheme.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110330e73u002nx\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

COOPER   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 646 \uc2 words\par \uc2 29 March 2011\par 20:53\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2011.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SALEM, Ore. (AP) - The Oregon Senate voted Tuesday to allow some illegal immigrants to pay in-state tuition at Oregon public universities.\par \par \uc2 The Senate's 18-11 vote sends the measure to the House, where two Republicans and six Democrats have already signed onto it.\par \par \uc2 Supporters cheered the vote, saying the Senate's approval gets them one step closer to a long-sought goal.\par \par \uc2 "It's within reach," said Orlando Lopez, a 22-year-old political science student at Western Oregon University who watched the vote from the Senate gallery. He said he got involved with the issue after seeing high school friends who couldn't afford tuition because they were illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Proponents of the legislation say students shouldn't be punished because their parents brought them to the United States illegally. And, the bill's backers say, the state should help students be productive residents after investing in years of public education.\par \par \uc2 "Have these children broken the law when many were carried into this country in the arms of their mother?" asked Sen. Frank Morse, R-Albany, a sponsor of the measure.\par \par \uc2 But opponents say illegal activity should never be excused, and the state should not give illegal immigrants a benefit that isn't available to U.S. citizens who live in other states.\par \par \uc2 Others point out that illegal immigrants can't legally work in the U.S.\par \par \uc2 "Unfortunately, children do pay for the sins of their parents," said Sen. Bruce Starr, R-Hillsboro, an opponent of the bill. "It's unfortunate, but it's reality."\par \par \uc2 Students should go through the legal immigration process before they go to college, not after, Starr said.\par \par \uc2 The measure, SB 742, would require universities to charge in-state tuition to illegal immigrants who attended at least five years of school in the United States, at least three of them in Oregon. They must be dependent on another adult for support and apply to college within three years of receiving a high school or GED diploma.\par \par \uc2 The in-state tuition would be good for up to five years at one of seven universities governed by the State Board of Higher Education. Students would be required to attest that they have applied for legal residency -- a provision aimed at ensuring they're eligible to work in the U.S. after they receive a degree.\par \par \uc2 "This bill does not guarantee a kid admission to any college or university in this state," said Senate President Peter Courtney, D-Salem. "It does not guarantee them a bachelor's degree. It doesn't guarantee their college will be paid for. It doesn't even guarantee them citizenship. It just gives them a path."\par \par \uc2 The difference between resident and nonresident tuition is different at every school but can be significant. At the University of Oregon, in-state tuition this year is $8,190, compared with $25,830 for an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , international student or out-of-state student.\par \par \uc2 Opponents of the bill argued that it would force the universities to give up thousands in lost revenue from students who otherwise would pay nonresident tuition.\par \par \uc2 But the higher education board voted to support the measure, and an analysis by the Oregon University System projected the schools would make money from the arrangement because more students would be able to afford to attend. University analysts projected that no single school would take in enough new students to need to hire more faculty.\par \par \uc2 The measure takes effect beginning in the 2012-2013 school year. University officials project they'd take on three additional students in the first year and 33 additional students the following year.\par \par \uc2 Illegal immigrants would continue to be prohibited from receiving state or federal scholarships.\par \par \uc2 The bill allows opponents to file an appeal directly to the state Supreme Court within 60 days.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110330e73u00044\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ATLANTA (AP) - The sponsor of a crackdown on illegal immigration that was enacted last year in Arizona said Tuesday he endorses a similar bill making its way through the Georgia Legislature.\par \par \uc2 Arizona Senate President Russell Pearce, a Republican, released a statement to "strongly express" his support of legislation proposed by Georgia state Rep. Matt Ramsey, R-Peachtree City.\par \par \uc2 "I have read the very comprehensive bill from Georgia and commend Georgia Representative Matt Ramsey for one of the most well-written, well thought-out pieces of badly needed state enforcement legislation in the nation," Pearce said.\par \par \uc2 Ramsey's bill would reduce the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  population in Georgia, protect jobs for citizens and legal immigrants and lower crime rates, Pearce said.\par \par \uc2 Opponents of Ramsey's bill say it would harm Georgia's economy and lead to racial profiling.\par \par \uc2 "The fact that Rep. Ramsey has been saying this is not an Arizona bill is clearly undermined by this," said Jerry Gonzalez, executive director of the Georgia Association of Latino Elected Officials, which has opposed Ramsey's bill and another sponsored by state Sen. Jack Murphy, R-Cumming.\par \par \uc2 Ramsey has repeatedly said his bill is not an Arizona copycat bill, and that he drew on many sources -- including other states' legislation, consultations with lawyers and comments from constituents -- when writing it.\par \par \uc2 Ramsey's bill would allow law enforcement officers to verify the immigration status of criminal suspects and would penalize people who transport or harbor illegal immigrants, provisions also in Arizona's law. Ramsey's bill also would require employers to verify the immigration status of new hires and would make it a felony to "willfully and fraudulently" present false documentation when applying for a job.\par \par \uc2 Ramsey's bill has passed the House but has not yet been scheduled for a Senate committee hearing. A House committee on Monday gutted Murphy's bill and replaced it with the text of Ramsey's before passing it and sending it to the House Rules Committee, which will decide if and when it gets a full House vote.\par \par \uc2 Illegal immigration has been a hot issue in legislatures around the country this year, with lawmakers in at least 25 states proposing laws that are similar to or at least include several provisions contained in Arizona's laws by mid-March, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110329e73t003qk\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

COOPER   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 703 \uc2 words\par \uc2 29 March 2011\par 16:29\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2011.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SALEM, Ore. (AP) - The Oregon Senate voted Tuesday to allow some illegal immigrants to pay in-state tuition at Oregon public universities.\par \par \uc2 The Senate's 18-11 vote sends the measure to the House, where two Republicans and six Democrats have already signed on to it.\par \par \uc2 Supporters of the legislation say students shouldn't be punished because their parents brought them to the United States illegally. And, the bill's backers say, the state should help students be productive residents after investing in years of public education.\par \par \uc2 Supporters cheered the vote, saying the Senate's approval gets them one step closer to a long-sought goal.\par \par \uc2 "It's within reach," said Orlando Lopez, a 22-year-old political science student at Western Oregon University who watched the vote from the Senate gallery. He said he got involved with the issue after seeing high school friends who couldn't afford tuition because they were illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Proponents of the bill say high school students who are in the country illegally were brought here as minors and shouldn't be punished for their parents' actions. Supporters say the state should encourage students to be productive residents after investing in years of public education through high school -- even if those students are illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 "Have these children broken the law when many were carried into this country in the arms of their mother?" asked Sen. Frank Morse, R-Albany, a sponsor of the measure.\par \par \uc2 But opponents say illegal activity should never be excused, and the state should not give illegal immigrants a benefit that isn't available to U.S. citizens who live in other states.\par \par \uc2 Others point out that illegal immigrants can't legally work in the U.S.\par \par \uc2 "Unfortunately, children do pay for the sins of their parents," said Sen. Bruce Starr, R-Hillsboro, an opponent of the bill. "It's unfortunate, but it's reality."\par \par \uc2 Students should go through the legal immigration process before they go to college, not after, Starr said.\par \par \uc2 The measure, SB 742, would require universities to charge in-state tuition to illegal immigrants who attended at least five years of school in the United States, at least three of them in Oregon. They must be dependent on another adult for support and apply to college within three years of receiving a high school or GED diploma.\par \par \uc2 The in-state tuition would be good for up to five years at one of seven universities governed by the State Board of Higher Education. Students would be required to attest that they have applied for legal residency -- a provision aimed at ensuring they're eligible to work in the U.S. after they receive a degree.\par \par \uc2 "This bill does not guarantee a kid admission to any college or university in this state," said Senate President Peter Courtney, D-Salem. "It does not guarantee them a bachelor's degree. It doesn't guarantee their college will be paid for. It doesn't even guarantee them citizenship. It just gives them a path."\par \par \uc2 The difference between resident and nonresident tuition is different at every school but can be significant. At the University of Oregon, in-state tuition this year is $8,190, compared with $25,830 for an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , international student or out-of-state student.\par \par \uc2 Opponents of the bill argued that it would force the universities to give up thousands in lost revenue from students who otherwise would pay nonresident tuition.\par \par \uc2 But the higher education board voted to support the measure, and an analysis by the Oregon University System projected the schools would make money from the arrangement because more students would be able to afford to attend. University analysts projected that no single school would take in enough new students to need to hire more faculty.\par \par \uc2 The measure takes effect beginning in the 2012-2013 school year. University officials project they'd take on three additional students in the first year and 33 additional students the following year.\par \par \uc2 Illegal immigrants would continue to be prohibited from receiving state or federal scholarships.\par \par \uc2 The bill allows opponents to file an appeal directly to the state Supreme Court within 60 days.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110329e73t002mp\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) - The murder of a prominent Cochise County rancher that triggered a nationwide outcry about border security remains unsolved a year later.\par \par \uc2 Investigators have identified a man who fits the description of the possible killer -- a tall, cross-border smuggler with a violent criminal record. But they don't know for sure if he's in the U.S. or Mexico, or if he's dead or alive.\par \par \uc2 And even if they find him, it won't mean the crime is solved.\par \par \uc2 Authorities haven't found the gun used to kill Robert Krentz on his ranch last March 27 and they have no witnesses, according to documents the Arizona Daily Star obtained through public records requests.\par \par \uc2 Krentz and his dog were gunned down on his property near the Mexico border shortly after he reported spotting someone who appeared to be in trouble.\par \par \uc2 Sheriff's officials said Krentz's all-terrain vehicle was running and his wounded dog was trying to defend him when authorities found his body in the remote area of his sprawling 35,000-acre ranch northeast of Douglas. The dog later died.\par \par \uc2 Krentz, 58, had been on his ATV checking water lines and fencing when he was shot. Neighbors and law enforcement officials later followed tracks apparently belonging to the killer 20 miles south into Mexico.\par \par \uc2 Authorities didn't discover Krentz's body until just before midnight on March 27, giving the killer a nearly 14-hour head start to flee south to Mexico. He was likely long gone by the time they followed his tracks to the border the next afternoon.\par \par \uc2 Sheriff's officials believe Krentz was killed by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who was headed to Mexico and worked as a scout for drug smugglers.\par \par \uc2 The murder became a flash point in the immigration debate. A month after the killing, Arizona lawmakers passed the nation's toughest legislation targeting illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 So far, there's been no closure for Krentz's heartbroken widow, children and grandchildren, and no explanation for shaken ranchers in this remote valley near the Arizona-New Mexico state line.\par \par \uc2 "We would like to know what the heck happened," said Bill McDonald, a fifth-generation rancher east of Douglas. "It doesn't make any sense to us."\par \par \uc2 Sheriff Larry Dever won't answer specific questions about the investigation.\par \par \uc2 "Rob Krentz was killed by a bad person with a bad agenda, and our porous borders continue to contribute to the potential for another event," Dever said. "I will never rest until this killer is brought to justice."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Information from: Arizona Daily Star, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.azstarnet.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.azstarnet.com}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110326e73q003w9\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 EL PASO, Texas (AP) - U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano said Thursday that security on the southern U.S. border "is better now than it ever has been" and that violence from neighboring Mexico hasn't spilled over in a serious way.\par \par \uc2 Napolitano spoke at the Bridge of The Americas border crossing, after a meeting with the mayors of the border towns of El Paso, Nogales, Ariz., and Yuma, Ariz. Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade Francisco Sanchez and U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Alan Bersin also were present.\par \par \uc2 Napolitano said the Department of Homeland Security will deploy 250 more border agents and expects to have 300 more under their next budget if it's approved. She stated that Homeland Security is investing "millions of dollars in the side of commerce and trade" to improve infrastructure and technology along the border.\par \par \uc2 However, she added that there is a need to correct wrong impressions about the border region. Napolitano said border towns are safe for travel, trade and commerce. She noted that the total value of imports crossing the Southwest border was up 22 percent in fiscal year 2010, she said.\par \par \uc2 "There is a perception that the border is worse now than it ever has been. That is wrong. The border is better now than it ever has been," she said.\par \par \uc2 The perception that the violence in Mexico has spilled over to bordering U.S. cities is "wrong again," Napolitano said. Violent crime rates have remained flat or decreased in border communities in the Southwest, she said. However, she recognized that "there is much to do with (their) colleagues in Mexico in respect to the drug cartels" that are largely responsible for the unprecedented wave of violence in that country.\par \par \uc2 El Paso Mayor John Cook said his city has been ranked the safest city in the country of its size, despite being across the border from Ciudad Juarez, which is at the center of Mexico's drug cartel violence.\par \par \uc2 "The lie about border cities being dangerous has been told so many times that people are starting to believe it, but we as border communities have to speak out," Cook sad.\par \par \uc2 Napolitano cited a reduction of 36 percent in the number of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  detentions, a key number to estimate the total of illegal border crossings, and the increase in trade as reasons to believe the situation along the border has improved.\par \par \uc2 "Numbers are in the right direction and dramatically so," she said.\par \par \uc2 Still, she stressed that she didn't come to El Paso "to run a victory lap" and that there "is much work to do."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110325e73p0002x\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

(AP) -- A southeast Kansas legislator's push to lure a state-owned casino to his area became tangled up Thursday with other lawmakers' attempts to intervene in a casino project south of Wichita.\par \par \uc2 Rep. Bob Grant, a Cherokee Democrat, has asked the House to pull a bill he's sponsoring with Rep. Doug Gatewood, a Columbus Democrat, out of its Federal and State Affairs Committee, where it hasn't had a hearing. They want to decrease the legally required minimum investment for a state-owned casino in southeast Kansas to encourage a developer to step forward.\par \par \uc2 The House expects to vote on Grant's request Monday, but leaders of the GOP majority oppose his attempt. Instead, some Republicans back a resolution directing Attorney General Derek Schmidt to file a lawsuit challenging state approval of a contract with the developer of a casino in Mulvane, south of Wichita.\par \par \uc2 The two issues are tied together because Federal and State Affairs Committee Chairman Steve Brunk, a Bel Aire Republican, said he doesn't want to consider any changes to the 2007 law allowing state-owned casinos until questions surrounding the Mulvane project are resolved. The House expects to have a debate Tuesday on the resolution dealing with the Wichita-area casino.\par \par \uc2 "Nobody's trying to stop gambling, but we do want to make sure that if we own and operate this thing, we do it with utmost integrity," Brunk said.\par \par \uc2 The resolution challenges the state Racing and Gaming Commission's decision in January to allow the Wichita-area project to go forward. It suggests local zoning issues weren't properly settled and noting that a misdemeanor campaign finance case against the developer and two top officers is pending in Iowa.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Kan. senator says he'll vote against SRS secretary\par \par \uc2 TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) -- The Kansas Senate's Democratic leader promised Thursday to vote against confirming Republican Gov. Sam Brownback's top social services appointee, accusing him of using intimidation to obtain a public endorsement from a mental health group.\par \par \uc2 Senate Minority Leader Anthony Hensley, of Topeka, also criticized Secretary Rob Siedlecki over the hiring of several new high-ranking aides at the Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services whose salaries are $75,000 or more. Hensley questioned whether the positions are necessary.\par \par \uc2 But the mental health group's executive director said he wasn't intimidated into writing the letter for Siedlecki, and Brownback's administration said the top aides' jobs were financed with savings in personnel costs elsewhere. It also wasn't clear whether Republicans, who hold a 32-8 majority in the Senate, have misgivings about the SRS secretary.\par \par \uc2 Siedlecki became SRS secretary when Brownback took office in January, but if senators didn't confirm the appointment, he'd have to give up the job. His appointment is before the Senate Ways and Means Committee, which had a confirmation hearing this week and plans another Monday.\par \par \uc2 "I don't believe that Secretary Siedlecki is qualified," Hensley said during a Statehouse news conference. "I've just heard from a number of senators that have similar concerns about whether he is really capable of doing the job."\par \par \uc2 Ways and Means Committee Chairwoman Carolyn McGinn, a Sedgwick Republican, said she thinks the committee will endorse Siedlecki's confirmation, but she wouldn't predict how the full Senate would vote.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 New proposal would raise K-State tuition 4 percent\par \par \uc2 MANHATTAN, Kan. (AP) -- If a preliminary proposal for a tuition increase is approved by Kansas State officials and the Board of Regents, the university would for the first time bring in more money from tuition than it receives from state funds.\par \par \uc2 The proposal, which would increase tuition 4 percent for the next academic year, would bring in $165.9 million in tuition revenue to the school, university officials said. Gov. Sam Brownback's fiscal year 2012 budget proposal calls for state funding for the university to remain at $164.9 million.\par \par \uc2 The tuition change would raise in-state undergraduate tuition to $231.30 per hour, an $8.90 increase, and out-of-state undergraduate tuition to $613.60 per hour, a $23.60 increase, the Manhattan Mercury reported Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 If student fees also increase 4 percent, an in-state undergraduate student taking 30 hours would pay $7,670, a $294 increase, during the next academic year, the newspaper said.\par \par \uc2 Bruce Shubert, Kansas State's vice president for administration and finance, said he hopes state funding will start to increase when the state's economy begins to improve, because it would be difficult to meet university needs otherwise.\par \par \uc2 University officials said they need an additional $13.1 million in fiscal year 2012, $9.6 million of which would be required spending increases -- such as $3.8 million to replace stimulus funds, $3.15 million to fund a 15 percent increase in employer group health insurance and $1.5 million to fund increased financial aid costs.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Treece residents to get extra money for buyout\par \par \uc2 TREECE, Kan. (AP) -- Residents of a contaminated southern Kansas town will be receiving more money for their property.\par \par \uc2 The Joplin Globe reports that Gov. Sam Brownback has approved a request to provide between $5,000 and $10,000 more to residents who have accepted buyouts, including those who have already moved.\par \par \uc2 The Treece Relocation Assistance Trust had asked Brownback to approve the increase.\par \par \uc2 Bob Jurgens, who is managing the federal buyout for the Kansas Department of Health and Environment, said Wednesday that the money should be sent to the residents next week.\par \par \uc2 The Environmental Protection Agency allocated $3.5 million to relocate Treece residents who want to leave the town because of contamination from decades of lead and zinc mining.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Immigrant charged in Kan. with assaulting agent\par \par \uc2 WICHITA, Kan. (AP) -- An \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Mexico is accused of using a box cutter to threaten a deportation officer who was questioning him in Wichita.\par \par \uc2 A criminal complaint filed Thursday in federal court charges 31-year-old Jose Luis Ramirez-Rico with assaulting a federal officer with a dangerous weapon.\par \par \uc2 According to court documents, agents from the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement went to Ramirez-Rico's house in Wichita on March 17. He's accused of picking up a box cutter with the blade out and thrusting it toward ICE agent Gregorio Perez when questioned about his immigration status.\par \par \uc2 An affidavit states that Perez yelled at Ramirez Rico to "drop the knife," before agents wrestled him to the floor and disarmed him before anyone was hurt.\par \par \uc2 No defense attorney is yet listed in court records.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Dodge CC appoints Woodburn as president\par \par \uc2 DODGE CITY, Kan.

The previous permanent president, Richard Burke, retired last June.\par \par \uc2 The Dodge City Daily Globe reports the Board of Trustees approved a two-year, three-month contract with Woodburn this week. It takes effect April 1.\par \par \uc2 Woodburn is a former president of Coffeyville Community College, in southeastern Kansas. He's also a former dean of the University of Nebraska College of Technical Agriculture.\par \par \uc2 Dodge City's trustees have called him a good fit for their school because of his background in rural colleges.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Ex-Wichita teacher convicted of sex with student\par \par \uc2 WICHITA, Kan.

He taught vocal music at Wichita Northwest High School.\par \par \uc2 KFDI radio reports Sedgwick County District Judge Gregory Waller found Edwards guilty Thursday of one count of unlawful sex with an 18-year-old female student. The judge dismissed two other counts.\par \par \uc2 Kansas law makes it illegal for a teacher to have sex with any student regardless of age.\par \par \uc2 Edwards is scheduled for sentencing May 16.

In it, Alfaro tells the detectives he slashed one of the victims with a machete on the orders of his half-brother, Rodolfo Godinez, but didn't intend to kill her. Seconds later, the three were each shot in the back of the head as they knelt in front of a wall in a school playground.\par \par \uc2 "My brother was watching me," Alfaro tells the detectives on the tape. "When he saw that I wasn't trying to really kill her, he told Jose (Carranza) to shoot her."\par \par \uc2 Godinez was convicted last year and is serving multiple life sentences for the slayings. Carranza, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Peru, and two other defendants await trial. Melvin Jovel pleaded guilty last fall and also is serving multiple life sentences.\par \par \uc2 In tearful testimony on Thursday, Nancy Ramirez, Alfaro's cousin, described how Alfaro came to her house the night after the attack and told her what happened.\par \par \uc2 "He was weird, like in shock," Ramirez testified. "He told me it was two boys and two girls. He said he had a knife. He just told me that they shot them and the other one was screaming in pain.\par \par \uc2 "I thought he was showing off," she continued. "I didn't want to believe it."\par \par \uc2 Dashon Harvey and Iofemi Hightower, both 20, and Terrance "T.J." Aeriel, 18, were enrolled or about to attend Delaware State University. The fourth victim, who isn't being identified by The Associated Press because of sexual assault charges against other defendants, was shot and slashed but survived and testified against Alfaro.\par \par \uc2 Ramirez also testified Thursday that the then-24-year-old Godinez "controlled" Alfaro and would frequently threaten him if he didn't do as told. Alfaro told police after his arrest that Godinez called him from the playground and told him to come with several others and to bring a machete, which Alfaro did.\par \par \uc2 In a portion of the tape played in court Wednesday, Alfaro said when the three victims had been assembled near the wall, Godinez told him, "You know what you have to do or else you know what's going to happen."\par \par \uc2 After jurors had left the courtroom Thursday, state Superior Court Judge Michael L. Ravin mentioned the possibility of the defense claiming that Alfaro was under duress at the time. Defense attorney Raymond Morasse didn't say whether he would take that tack. Ravin noted that a duress defense would almost certainly require Alfaro to testify.\par \par \uc2 The state is expected to conclude its case when the trial resumes Monday.\par \par \uc2 Three of the defendants, including Alfaro, were under 17 at the time of the murders. All are being tried as adults. Alfaro faces 17 counts including murder, robbery and felony murder.\par \par \uc2 The killings served as a tipping point at a time when Newark was struggling to control a spike in violent crime. Murders in the city had risen 50 percent in the early part of the decade, but the publicity surrounding the slayings was credited with spurring anti-crime measures that helped drive the murder rate down.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110324e73o002m4\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ESCONDIDO, Calif. (AP) - A city that has taken numerous steps to crack down on illegal immigration is now joining a string of Southern California municipalities that are signing up to tap a federal database aimed at tighter scrutiny of employees' immigration status.\par \par \uc2 Escondido's measure is modest compared to how others have embraced the free E-Verify tool, an online federal database now used voluntarily by employers nationwide. The north San Diego suburb's City Council voted 4-1 Wednesday to require all city contractors to use the screening for new hires and earlier this month began doing the same for all new city employees earlier this month.\par \par \uc2 The city will urge -- but not require -- private businesses to perform enhanced checks on new hires. Lancaster, north of Los Angeles, became the first city in Southern California to require private businesses to use E-Verify in January 2010 and was followed by others including Murrieta, Temecula and Lake Elsinore in the economically battered Inland Empire.\par \par \uc2 "We don't really want to be a heavy-handed government," said Escondido Mayor Sam Abed, a Lebanese immigrant and former \uc2 IBM Corp\uc2 . employee who has made illegal immigration a signature issue. "It's in their self-interest. We hope businesses will realize the benefit."\par \par \uc2 The proposal has sparked a familiar, if relatively muted, debate in Escondido, a city of 140,000 people that is about 50 percent Latino. Supporters say tougher immigration enforcement is overdue, while critics worry about fueling anti-immigrant sentiment.\par \par \uc2 In 2006, the City Council voted to require landlords to verify tenants' immigration status. The city dropped the measure before it took effect when a federal judge questioned whether it would survive legal scrutiny.\par \par \uc2 That same year, police introduced drivers' license checkpoints that resulted in seizures of hundreds of cars a year. Illegal immigrants cannot get drivers' licenses in California, so many lose their cars.\par \par \uc2 And last year, the city formed an unusually close alliance with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which has two agents stationed at police headquarters to respond when people who are pulled over a traffic citation or questioned for other violations are found to have deportation orders or criminal records.\par \par \uc2 Police say they have turned over more than 400 illegal immigrants to ICE since the alliance, called Operation Joint Effort, began in May.\par \par \uc2 E-Verify allows employers to run a worker's information against Department of Homeland Security and Social Security databases to check whether the person is permitted to work in the U.S. The Obama administration has made cracking down on employers who hire people here illegally a central part of its immigration enforcement policy.\par \par \uc2 Much of the criticism of E-Verify has focused on whether U.S. citizens and legal immigrants with permission to work were falsely flagged as illegal workers. Immigration officials have been taking steps to improve such inaccuracies.\par \par \uc2 Al's Towing, which has a contract to tow vehicles for the police department, signed up E-Verify when owner Josh Park learned the city might make it mandatory. Previously, he examined a job applicant's documents and gave his blessings as long as they looked legitimate to his naked eye. Now, he says, he has an extra safeguard to ensure his employees are legally entitled to work.\par \par \uc2 "We were required by law to verify to a certain extent, this just allows you to check it," said Park, one of more than 250,000 employers nationwide -- including about 100 in Escondido -- who have enrolled in E-Verify. "Before, there was no tool to use."\par \par \uc2 Juan Gonzalez, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Mexico who makes about $75 a day as a laborer, says the new measure will have limited impact because it is limited to city contractors and doesn't apply to those who hire him.\par \par \uc2 "There is work, but it's on the farms, landscaping, tearing off roofs -- the kind of work that many people won't do for $10 an hour," he said.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110324e73o000d0\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - One of six people charged in the 2007 murders of three college-bound young people at a playground described the attack in chilling detail on a tape played for jurors Wednesday, including the order he got from another suspect to slash the victims with a machete.\par \par \uc2 The taped statement from Alexander Alfaro, who said his half-brother called him to come to the playground that night with the machete, was the most detailed description yet of the crime that made national headlines and prompted numerous anti-crime initiatives in New Jersey's largest city.\par \par \uc2 "My brother tells them to get on the wall, and he looks at me and tells me, `You know what you have to do. You know what's going to happen.' I had to take out the machete and I cut her a couple times."\par \par \uc2 His words were part of a taped statement played by prosecutors at his trial. Alfaro was a 16-year-old at the time of the murders of Dashon Harvey and Iofemi Hightower, both 20, and 18-year-old Terrance "T.J." Aeriel in the playground of Newark's Mount Vernon School on Aug. 4, 2007.\par \par \uc2 Alfaro is the second of the six men and boys charged with the murders to go to trial. Last spring his half-brother, Rodolfo Godinez, was convicted on all counts, and in the fall, Melvin Jovel pleaded guilty. Both men are serving multiple life sentences. Trials for three other defendants have yet to be scheduled.\par \par \uc2 The murders shocked a city where gun violence was commonplace, and the resultant publicity was credited with raising awareness and helping push the murder rate down 40 percent, though it has crept back up in the last two years.\par \par \uc2 Friends and family members of the victims dabbed at tears in the gallery Wednesday as they listened to Alfaro's statement, made after his arrest in Virginia two weeks after the slayings. One remark in particular struck a nerve as Alfaro described the trio's final moments.\par \par \uc2 A detective asks him whether any of the assailants said anything to the victims before they were each shot in the back of the head as they sat facing a wall.\par \par \uc2 "There was something said to them before they were shot," Alfaro says. "`Remember the MS-13.'"\par \par \uc2 MS-13 is the violent street gang that prosecutors contend provided the backdrop for the particularly senseless and savage attack in which two victims were also slashed with a knife and machete. The victims -- including a fourth, a survivor who isn't being named because of sexual assault charges against another defendant -- were headed to Delaware State University in the fall and knew each other from playing in marching bands.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors and police steadfastly had refused to classify the case as gang-related for nearly a year after the murders, partly to avoid racial tensions in Newark. The victims are black, and five of the six defendants are Latino.\par \par \uc2 Jurors listened Wednesday as Alfaro told detectives that Godinez called him from the playground and told him to bring a machete. Alfaro said he found the weapon and went with three others, including Gerardo Gomez, his cousin who had turned 15 that day and who brought a gun that Alfaro said jammed during the attack and wouldn't fire.\par \par \uc2 Alfaro's version of events supports what the state sought to demonstrate at Godinez's trial; namely, that Godinez was the ringleader who assembled the group and orchestrated the attack.\par \par \uc2 In his statement, Alfaro describes how, after Godinez saw he wasn't going to kill Hightower with the machete, Godinez told Carranza to shoot all three. That version is at odds with other evidence, specifically Jovel's admission at his guilty plea that he actually shot them.\par \par \uc2 Alfaro also described being driven from Newark to New York City before returning to Newark. At the same time, police were closing in on the group after first lifting Carranza's prints off a beer bottle at the scene, then arresting Gomez when they found him at an address listed for Carranza.\par \par \uc2 Carranza, a 28-year-old \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Peru at the time, surrendered five days after the murders.\par \par \uc2 Shahid Baskerville, whom Alfaro called his "best friend" on the tape, was arrested the following day in Morristown, N.J. Godinez was arrested two weeks after the murders in Maryland, hours before Alfaro's arrest in Virginia. Jovel was the last one to be arrested, in neighboring Elizabeth, N.J., the next day.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors are expected to finish playing Alfaro's statement Thursday and then call as a witness an aunt whom Alfaro visited after he returned from New York.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110323e73n002ww\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

California city mulls more immigration scrutiny for contractors as new screening takes hold\b0\par\par\uc2 By ELLIOT SPAGAT   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 679 \uc2 words\par \uc2 23 March 2011\par 17:51\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2011.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ESCONDIDO, Calif. (AP) - A city that has taken numerous steps to crack down on illegal immigration is at it again -- this time joining a string of Southern California municipalities that are signing up to tap a federal database aimed at tighter scrutiny of employees' immigration status.\par \par \uc2 Escondido's measure is modest compared to how others have embraced the free E-Verify tool, an online federal database now used voluntarily by employers nationwide. The north San Diego suburb began requiring checks on new city hires earlier this month and would require the same of all city contractors under a proposal before the City Council on Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 The City Council would also urge -- but not require -- private businesses to perform enhanced checks on new hires. Lancaster, north of Los Angeles, became the first city in Southern California to require private businesses to use E-Verify in January 2010 and was followed by others including Murrieta, Temecula and Lake Elsinore in the economically battered Inland Empire.\par \par \uc2 "We don't really want to be a heavy-handed government," said Escondido Mayor Sam Abed, a Lebanese immigrant and former \uc2 IBM Corp\uc2 . employee who has made illegal immigration a signature issue. "It's in their self-interest. We hope businesses will realize the benefit."\par \par \uc2 The proposal has sparked a familiar, if relatively muted, debate in Escondido, a city of 140,000 people that is about 50 percent Latino. Supporters say tougher immigration enforcement is overdue, while critics worry about fueling anti-immigrant sentiment.\par \par \uc2 In 2006, the City Council voted to require landlords to verify tenants' immigration status. The city dropped the measure before it took effect when a federal judge questioned whether it would survive legal scrutiny.\par \par \uc2 That same year, police introduced drivers' license checkpoints that resulted in seizures of hundreds of cars a year. Illegal immigrants cannot get drivers' licenses in California, so many lose their cars.\par \par \uc2 And last year, the city formed an unusually close alliance with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which has two agents stationed at police headquarters to respond when people who are pulled over a traffic citation or questioned for other violations are found to have deportation orders or criminal records.\par \par \uc2 Police say they have turned over more than 400 illegal immigrants to ICE since the alliance, called Operation Joint Effort, began in May.\par \par \uc2 E-Verify allows employers to run a worker's information against Department of Homeland Security and Social Security databases to check whether the person is permitted to work in the U.S. The Obama administration has made cracking down on employers who hire people here illegally a central part of its immigration enforcement policy.\par \par \uc2 Much of the criticism of E-Verify has focused on whether U.S. citizens and legal immigrants with permission to work were falsely flagged as illegal workers. Immigration officials have been taking steps to improve such inaccuracies.\par \par \uc2 Al's Towing, which has a contract to tow vehicles for the police department, signed up E-Verify when owner Josh Park learned the city might make it mandatory. Previously, he examined a job applicant's documents and gave his blessings as long as they looked legitimate to his naked eye. Now, he says, he has an extra safeguard to ensure his employees are legally entitled to work.\par \par \uc2 "We were required by law to verify to a certain extent, this just allows you to check it," said Park, one of more than 250,000 employers nationwide -- including about 100 in Escondido -- who have enrolled in E-Verify. "Before, there was no tool to use."\par \par \uc2 Juan Gonzalez, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Mexico who makes about $75 a day as a laborer, says the new measure will have limited impact because it is limited to city contractors and doesn't apply to those who hire him.\par \par \uc2 "There is work, but it's on the farms, landscaping, tearing off roofs -- the kind of work that many people won't do for $10 an hour," he said.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110323e73n002sm\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WORCESTER, Mass. (AP) - The NAACP's newly revived Worcester chapter elected a 28-year-old openly gay black man as its president this month. In New Jersey, a branch of the organization outside Atlantic City chose a Honduran immigrant to lead it last year. And in Mississippi, the Jackson State University chapter recently turned to a 30-something white man.\par \par \uc2 Founded more than a century ago to promote black equality, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People is seeing remarkable diversity in its leadership ranks -- the result of an aggressive effort over the past four or five years to boost NAACP membership and broaden the civil rights organization's agenda to confront prejudice in its many forms.\par \par \uc2 "This is the new NAACP," said Clark University political science professor Ravi Perry, the new chapter president in Worcester. "This is a human rights organization, and we have an obligation to fight discrimination at all levels."\par \par \uc2 NAACP branches have been recruiting gays, immigrants and young people who grew up in a world far removed from the landmark 1954 Brown vs. Board of Education ruling that outlawed school segregation. Now, leadership positions that were once held only by blacks are being filled by members of other racial or ethnic groups.\par \par \uc2 The group does not keep track of numbers, but in recent years NAACP chapters in New Jersey, Connecticut and Georgia have elected Hispanics as president. A white man was picked to lead the chapter in Aiken, S.C. And two years ago, NAACP members in Hamtramck, Mich., a Detroit suburb, selected a Bangladeshi American to revive their long-dormant chapter.\par \par \uc2 "Some people mentioned that it wouldn't be possible for me to be president," said Victor Diaz, 32, a Dominican American who ran against an incumbent and was elected president of the Waterbury, Conn., branch in November. "But when I ran, I won 3 to 1."\par \par \uc2 The push for diversity troubles some members of the NAACP's old guard, who worry that problems in the black community may get short shrift. But some social scientists say the new diversity is merely a return to the group's roots as a biracial organization.\par \par \uc2 In 1964, the NAACP's membership peaked at 625,000 paid members. By the middle of the past decade, that had dropped to just under 300,000. Now it has reversed course and climbed to more than 525,000, in large part because of an increase in young members, group officials say. The NAACP said it does not keep track of the organization's racial and ethnic breakdown.\par \par \uc2 Stefanie Brown, the NAACP's 30-year-old national field director, said the under-25 crowd is the organization's fastest-growing age group. In fact, the NAACP has slots on its 60-plus member board of directors reserved for people under 25. In addition, Brown said, young professionals under 40 are taking leadership roles -- something that hadn't happened until recently.\par \par \uc2 Some in the group say the diversity push weakens the NAACP's identity. Jamarhl Crawford, editor of the Blackstonian, a Boston website that covers the city's black population, said he fears it could "water down" the focus on problems in the black community.\par \par \uc2 "I think there's going to be some loss there in terms of actual activism, actual protest" on behalf of blacks, said Crawford, a 40-year-old member of the NAACP's Boston branch.\par \par \uc2 The diversity push was started a few years ago under then-NAACP chairman Julian Bond. Later, Benjamin Todd Jealous, who in 2008 became the group's youngest leader at age 35, ramped up the effort and also urged the organization to take up gay rights.\par \par \uc2 "At our core, we want to end discrimination and have equality for all people," Brown said.\par \par \uc2 In a reflection of how it has broadened its agenda, the NAACP came out against California's Proposition 8, the ballot measure banning gay marriage. Last year, it spoke out against Arizona's anti-immigration law. It also strongly supported the federal DREAM Act, a proposal to give \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students a pathway to citizenship through college or military service.\par \par \uc2 Perry, the openly gay chapter president, said: "I'm just one example of younger individuals who find a home in the NAACP for issues that they might represent."\par \par \uc2 Patricia Sullivan, a history professor at the University of South Carolina and author of "Lift Every Voice: The NAACP and the Making of the Civil Rights Movement," called the new push for diversity thrilling and said: "It's really reflecting what the NAACP has represented historically and what its vision has been."\par \par \uc2 Founded in 1909 partly in response to race riots in Springfield, Ill., NAACP begin as a coalition of black and Jewish activists with whites serving in leadership position in many chapters, and it was only later that it became a predominantly black organization. Sullivan also noted that the NAACP spoke out against the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II.\par \par \uc2 Tatcho Mindiola, director of the Center for Mexican American Studies at the University of Houston, said that while some Hispanics were NAACP members during the civil right years, their election to leadership roles is a new phenomenon. Mindiola said the NAACP has won over some Hispanics because of recent positions it has taken on issues important to Latinos.\par \par \uc2 "The group has shown it is fighting for civil rights for all minorities," said David Alcantara, 52, president of the Pleasantville-Mainland chapter in New Jersey. "And it's time that all minorities support the NAACP."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110323e73n001hk\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

COOPER   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 654 \uc2 words\par \uc2 22 March 2011\par 19:24\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2011.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SALEM, Ore. (AP) - The state Senate could vote as soon as next week on a bill that would allow some illegal immigrants to pay in-state tuition at Oregon universities.\par \par \uc2 The measure has ignited a debate about whether any state benefits should extend to young people brought illegally to the United States as children. Supporters say children shouldn't be punished for their parents' actions, and the state should help students be productive residents after investing in years of public education.\par \par \uc2 "We're talking about children who are in a no man's land, not of their choice," said Sen. David Nelson, R-Pendleton, a sponsor of the bill.\par \par \uc2 But opponents say illegal activity should never be excused.\par \par \uc2 "They try to blame sympathy. But the bucket of sympathy from American citizens has dried up," said Jim Ludwig, president of Oregonians for Immigration Reform. "They're tired of people who come here illegally and use those services and want more."\par \par \uc2 Still, the bill has bipartisan support and could fare well in the Senate.\par \par \uc2 The measure, SB 742, passed the Senate Education and Workforce Development Committee on a 4-1 vote last week. It would require universities to charge in-state tuition to illegal immigrants who attended at least three years of school in Oregon and applied to college within three years of receiving a high school or GED diploma. The in-state tuition would be good for up to five years at one of seven universities governed by the State Board of Higher Education.\par \par \uc2 It also would require the students to attest that they have applied for legal residency -- a provision aimed at ensuring students are eligible to work in the U.S. after they receive a degree.\par \par \uc2 Ten states have similar laws, including West Coast neighbors Oregon and California.\par \par \uc2 The difference between resident and nonresident tuition is different at every school but can be significant. At the University of Oregon, in-state tuition this year is $8,190, compared with $25,830 for an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , international student or out-of-state student.\par \par \uc2 Opponents of the bill contend that it would cost the universities thousands in lost revenue from students who would otherwise pay nonresident tuition. But proponents say any lost revenue would be more than made up by increased tuition income from students who couldn't otherwise afford to go to college.\par \par \uc2 Samantha Moreno, a 16-year-old high school student who was brought to the U.S. illegally at age 6, said she's worried about how she'd afford to go to college and help her family with bills if she had to pay nonresident tuition.\par \par \uc2 "My mom is my only supporter right now. I would struggle a lot with money," said Moreno, who has lived in Eugene for 10 years.\par \par \uc2 Illegal immigrants would continue to be prohibited from receiving state or federal scholarships.\par \par \uc2 Oregon University System officials project they'd take on three additional students in the 2012-13 school year and 33 additional students the following year. The analysis also projects that no campus would take on more than 15 additional students or have to add faculty. The higher education board has voted to support the legislation.\par \par \uc2 Sen. Frank Morse, R-Albany, said he has voted against the bill in the past but changed his mind after hearing from a guidance counselor who had an exceptionally talented student who couldn't continue her education because she couldn't afford out-of-state tuition.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) - The Washington state Legislature's key budget writers are heading back to the drawing board after an expected but unwelcome revenue forecast showed the state is projected to lose an additional $780 million in tax collections during the next two years.\par \par \uc2 "Don't ask me about a date," said Sen. Ed Murray, D-Seattle, and chair of the Senate's Ways and Means committee. His House counterpart, Rep. Ross Hunter, D-Medina, echoed Murray's sentiments, saying he had his budget ready to be unveiled next week.\par \par \uc2 Not anymore.\par \par \uc2 Economic recovery has been slow. The state's stubbornly moribund financial shape is the focus of this year's Legislative session. Using projected revenue from tax collections, the key task for lawmakers is to approve a budget for the next two years.\par \par \uc2 Gov. Chris Gregoire's office says the state needs about $37 billion keep up with demands and rising expenses for the next biennium. On Thursday, chief state economist Arun Raha said the expected tax collections for the next two years are going be $32 billion.\par \par \uc2 The difference between those two figures -- about $5 billion -- is what lawmakers and Gregoire are tasked to address.\par \par \uc2 In December, Gregoire proposed nearly an all-cuts budget that trimmed state spending to $32 billion. It eliminated big expensive, programs that provided health care for the poor and financial assistance to disabled adults. It also cut health care for \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  children; raised tuition for universities and community colleges; consolidated state agencies and commissions; established higher rates for state parks; along with a host of minor cuts and money transfers.\par \par \uc2 "The budget process begins in earnest now," Gregoire said after the revenue forecast. "We cannot trim our way out of it. We are going to have to make cuts, and they will be felt everywhere throughout the state."\par \par \uc2 Gregoire also reminded lawmakers that voters rejected taxes in the 2010 election. They shot down taxes to soda and income taxes for the rich. They also reinstated the rule that two-thirds of votes in each chamber are needed to raise taxes and fees.\par \par \uc2 Now it's time for Senate and House lawmakers to present their counterproposals. So far, Democrats have indicated a reluctance to cut as much as Gregoire proposed.\par \par \uc2 "These are hard decisions to do," Hunter said. "The problem has become more daunting."\par \par \uc2 Republicans are pushing for ideas that echo Gregoire's, and they view the bad fiscal shape as an opportunity to reshape the way state government works. Republicans in the Senate are also enjoying a bigger influence on the budget.\par \par \uc2 "Our priority for the several weeks remaining in this session should be clear: Come up with a budget and policy changes that together do what the governor recommended when our session began, which is to recognize that government cannot do it all," said Sen. Joe Zarelli, R-Ridgefield, the Senate GOP's budget chief.\par \par \uc2 The budget gap, though, includes projected costs for two voter-approved initiatives that reduce class sizes and give salary increases to teachers that would cost $1.1 billion. Lawmakers don't plan on funding those initiatives, so shave off $1 billion from the top.\par \par \uc2 This year the House is presenting their budget first, followed by the Senate.\par \par \uc2 Ideas to cut into the deficit abound. A proposal to expand electronic gambling in non-tribal venues has been floated. Supporters say $380 million per biennium could be raised. Another group is pushing for contracting the distribution of liquor to private firms for $300 million in a lump sum payment plus a share of the profits. A coalition of liberal groups have lobbied for ending tax breaks for corporations -- an idea that hasn't gotten much traction.\par \par \uc2 A budget gimmick that would push payments on state programs into the 2013-2015 biennium has also tested the water. The so called 25th-month proposal got a cold reception from Gregoire this past week. It took the state more than 15 years, she noted, to pay off the debt the state racked up the last time lawmakers used the maneuver.\par \par \uc2 Earlier this month, Rep. Kathy Haigh, D-Shelton, confirmed House Democrats are also considering borrowing money, with the interest to be paid by anticipated future revenues. Lawmakers took similar action earlier this decade, bonding against the hundreds of millions of dollars expected from the national tobacco settlement.\par \par \uc2 Gregoire shot that idea down as well, saying that the state ended up paying huge amounts of interest.\par \par \uc2 Conservative lawmakers have proposed re-opening state worker contracts to renegotiation, but Gregoire argues that state workers have already taken a fair share of wage reductions, furloughs and higher health care premiums negotiated last year.\par \par \uc2 "There are a lot of bad ideas in the world. Some are less bad than others. Some are very bad. We're going to try to do the least-bad set of options we can do," Hunter said.\par \par \uc2 But before lawmakers tackle the two-year budget, they still need to close a shortfall estimated to be about $200 million in this fiscal year, which ends in June.\par \par \uc2 Murray and Hunter said they will present another supplemental budget soon.\par \par \uc2 --------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writer Molly Rosbach and Associated Press writer Donna Blankinship in Seattle contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110321e73l0028l\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc74}{\*\bkmkend toc74}\b \uc2 AP Enterprise: People questioned in terror cases seek to clear names as government is silent\b0\par\par\uc2 By CHRIS HAWLEY and JOHN CURRAN   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 2,007 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 March 2011\par 15:29\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2011.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 NEW YORK (AP) - As the U.S. ramps up efforts to root out homegrown terrorism, hundreds of people who have fallen under suspicion are in a state of limbo: Many say they have been singled out unfairly for scrutiny but have been neither charged nor cleared.\par \par \uc2 Some of them, mostly Muslims, have spent weeks in jail; others find it impossible to travel freely. Some say they have had their reputations destroyed by the news coverage. Many were questioned or tracked, and say they felt violated and fearful.\par \par \uc2 Lawsuits filed by suspects since 2006 have pried millions of dollars in settlements from the government. The U.S. Supreme Court this month heard one of the most serious challenges yet, the case of a Kansas man who claims his detention as a "material witness" destroyed his marriage and his career.\par \par \uc2 Many plaintiffs say they recognize the security challenges the government faces after Sept. 11; but in many cases, they complain, the government refuses to reveal why someone has attracted attention. Without that information, they argue, it is impossible to clear their names.\par \par \uc2 "It's a runaround," said Ayman Latif, an American who was stranded in Egypt for six months and questioned by U.S. agents last year after his name appeared on a no-fly list. "Maybe they had a hunch about something and my name came up and they were investigating it. But they wouldn't tell me what that hunch was."\par \par \uc2 The FBI says it needs secrecy to protect sensitive investigations and to avoid giving terrorists clues for avoiding detection.\par \par \uc2 The government does not disclose how many people it investigates, but an Associated Press analysis gives a glimpse of how the number has grown. Federal terrorism referrals -- cases in which investigators have contacted prosecutors for guidance -- have risen 44 percent since 2002, from 864 to 1,249 in 2010, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a research program at Syracuse University.\par \par \uc2 At the same time, the number of people on the FBI's consolidated terrorist watch list stands at 450,000, despite efforts since 2006 to winnow it down. Of those, 18,000 have been flagged for extra screening at airports. About 10,000 people are on the no-fly list, 500 to 1,000 of them U.S. citizens.\par \par \uc2 Some law enforcement experts say agents are simply doing their jobs by investigating leads, some of which pan out and some of which don't.\par \par \uc2 Moreover, police work is full of instances in which investigators know someone is up to no good, but they don't have enough evidence to make an arrest. Charles Strozier, director of the Center on Terrorism at New York's John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said the nature of counterterrorism work means investigators must monitor people for long periods even though they have committed no crime.\par \par \uc2 "Counterterrorism work completely reverses the familiar process of police work, which is, you have a crime, you collect forensic evidence and then you go after the bad guy," Strozier said. "In counterterrorism, everything must come before the crime is committed or you've completely failed at your task."\par \par \uc2 People who say they're caught in limbo include:\par \par \uc2 -- Yasir Afifi, a 20-year-old college student in Santa Monica, Calif., who found a tracking device on his car when he went for an oil change in October. He said he believes he attracted attention because his father was a Muslim cleric, he sends money to Egypt to support his two younger brothers, and he travels to see them about once a year. The FBI would not comment on his case.\par \par \uc2 -- Pascal Abidor, an Islamic studies Ph.D. student at McGill University in Montreal, who said he was frisked, taken off a train in handcuffs, put in a holding cell, fingerprinted and questioned after a border agent found on his laptop a picture of a militant rally he had downloaded for schoolwork. He has sued the Department of Homeland Security, saying the agent had no right to go through his computer without a warrant. In court papers, the government said agents do, in fact, have such a right. The government did not say what raised its suspicions.\par \par \uc2 -- Abe Mashal, a 30-year-old dog trainer and former Marine from St. Charles, Ill., who was not allowed on a Chicago-to-Spokane flight in April because he had sent what he described as innocent e-mails to a Muslim cleric agents were watching. He said he refused to feed authorities information about fellow Muslims, and in June he joined 16 other people in a lawsuit challenging the way the FBI and Transportation Security Administration manage the terrorism watch list and no-fly list.\par \par \uc2 The Justice Department and Homeland Security would not comment on any evidence they may have against Mashal, but in their response to the lawsuit, government lawyers argued that keeping terrorists in the dark about investigators' techniques outweighs citizens' right to know why they have been put on blacklists. In October, Homeland Security sent Mashal a letter saying it had reviewed his file and "it has been determined that no changes or corrections are warranted at this time."\par \par \uc2 The House held hearings this month examining whether American Muslims are becoming "radicalized" to attack the United States. The government has warned that homegrown terrorism plots are on the rise and has redoubled efforts to root them out. Federal investigators note that "lone wolf" attacks such as in the 2009 Fort Hood shooting and the Times Square bombing attempt in May have put a new emphasis on finding radicals before they act.\par \par \uc2 "Beyond the sheer number of disruptions and arrests that have come to light, homegrown extremists are increasingly more savvy, harder to detect and able to connect with other extremists overseas," the Justice Department said in a statement to the AP.\par \par \uc2 But human rights groups say some of the government's favorite investigative tools are prone to abuse: warrantless surveillance, aggressive searches at the border, secretive watch lists, and laws that allow investigators to detain people as "material witnesses" -- people they want to testify at a trial or before a grand jury. In other cases, investigators find immigration violations that allow them to hold suspects for months or years.\par \par \uc2 Authorities should have to explain to suspects why they are on the watch list and notify them if they have been cleared of wrongdoing, said Nusrat Choudhury, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union who is representing people challenging the no-fly list.\par \par \uc2 "Instead, people are kind of left in the dark," Choudhury said.\par \par \uc2 In a statement, the FBI responded: "If the Terrorism Screening Center publicly revealed each person who was on the terrorist watch list, terrorist organizations would be able to circumvent the purpose of the terrorist watch list by determining in advance which of their members are likely to be questioned or detained."\par \par \uc2 This month, the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments in the case of Abdullah Al-Kidd, a Kansas man arrested in 2003 as he tried to board a flight to Saudi Arabia to study Arabic and Islamic law. Al-Kidd was never charged with a crime, but prosecutors wanted him to testify against Sami Omar Al-Hussayen, a man charged with providing material support to terrorists. Like Al-Kidd, Al-Hussayen had attended the University of Idaho.\par \par \uc2 Al-Kidd was strip-searched repeatedly and held for 16 days in high-security cells, court documents show. For the next 15 months he was barred from traveling outside a four-state area and had to make weekly calls to a court officer and submit to a monthly search of his home. Al-Kidd said the stress destroyed his marriage and cost him his job delivering supplies to a store on Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada.\par \par \uc2 In the end, Al-Hussayen was acquitted of the terrorism charges but agreed to be deported for visa fraud. Al-Kidd was never called to testify in any trial. He has sued former Attorney General John Ashcroft, alleging he was deprived of his freedom.\par \par \uc2 The Justice Department says it uses its detention powers carefully and mainly in cases where it fears people will flee the country.\par \par \uc2 Sometimes the government simply gets the wrong suspect. Mistaken-arrest cases are becoming increasingly costly to taxpayers in the form of out-of-court settlements.\par \par \uc2 Since 2006, the government has paid $2 million to an Oregon man jailed after the 2004 train bombings in Madrid, $250,000 to a man detained after an aviation radio was found in his hotel room near New York's ground zero, and $1.8 million to seven men detained shortly after Sept. 11. Another lawsuit moving through a New York court represents 1,200 men rounded up after Sept. 11.\par \par \uc2 Law enforcement experts say such cases are a natural byproduct of aggressive detective work.\par \par \uc2 "Show me any kind of criminal or national security activity where you have no false positives or no false negatives," said James Carafano, a national security expert at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative Washington think tank. "If your metric of success is that no one's ever going to be inconvenienced, ever, then the system is never going to be good enough."\par \par \uc2 Other people have suffered from the publicity surrounding their arrests. Pakistani immigrant Pir Khan spent 76 days in solitary confinement last year after investigators detained him in the wake of the Times Square bombing attempt. Khan's nephew, who was living with him, had once sent money home to Pakistan using a money-transfer system common among Middle Eastern immigrants, in which payments are passed along until they reach an immigrant's family back home, according to investigators and Khan's own lawyer. Attempted bomber Faisal Shahzad was one link in the chain.\par \par \uc2 In jail, other inmates yelled, "Terrorist!" at him, Khan said. His American-born wife received death threats. Reporters interviewed his neighbors, scoured his wife's \uc2 Facebook\uc2  page for information and speculated on whether his marriage was a sham.\par \par \uc2 Khan said his credit rating was ruined after bills and other mail started disappearing, and he lost his taxi. No terrorism charges were ever brought against him. But now he is fighting deportation as an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . He is living in a Boston suburb and working as a mechanic.\par \par \uc2 "I lost a lot of things," Khan said. "I have to put it behind my back and just get on with my life."\par \par \uc2 Though Khan said he was questioned repeatedly about the bombings, the Justice Department said he was jailed solely because of immigration violations. Homeland Security said the decision to keep him in solitary was made by the sheriff's department in Plymouth County, Mass., which runs the jail. A sheriff's spokesman, John Birtwell, said only that detainees who have been in the news are sometimes separated to protect them from other prisoners.\par \par \uc2 Many suspects say they fear their names will forever carry a black mark.\par \par \uc2 Afifi, the California college student who found the tracking device on his car, said agents questioned him in front of his neighbors, hinted they knew about his new job and where he went on dates, and left him feeling frightened.\par \par \uc2 In November, Afifi went to Egypt to visit relatives. When he returned to the U.S., two federal agents were waiting for him at the airport. He was detained and questioned for four hours about his trip, he said. Last week he filed a lawsuit challenging FBI rules allowing agents to track suspects electronically without a warrant.\par \par \uc2 "I understand that maybe they have the right to do that to any American citizen as long as they think they have something against them," Afifi said. "But I don't know what they have against me, and that's the problem."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Curran reported from Montpelier, Vt.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) - The Legislature's key budget writers are heading back to the drawing board after an expected but unwelcome revenue forecast showed the state is projected to lose an additional $780 million in tax collections during the next two years.\par \par \uc2 "Don't ask me about a date," said Sen. Ed Murray, D-Seattle, and chair of the Senate's Ways and Means committee. His House counterpart, Rep. Ross Hunter, D-Medina, echoed Murray's sentiments, saying he had his budget ready to be unveiled next week.\par \par \uc2 Not anymore.\par \par \uc2 Economic recovery has been slow. The state's stubbornly moribund financial shape is the focus of this year's Legislative session. Using projected revenue from tax collections, the key task for lawmakers is to approve a budget for the next two years.\par \par \uc2 Gov. Chris Gregoire's office says the state needs about $37 billion keep up with demands and rising expenses for the next biennium. On Thursday, chief state economist Arun Raha said the expected tax collections for the next two years are going be $32 billion.\par \par \uc2 The difference between those two figures -- about $5 billion -- is what lawmakers and Gregoire are tasked to address.\par \par \uc2 In December, Gregoire proposed nearly an all-cuts budget that trimmed state spending to $32 billion. It eliminated big expensive, programs that provided health care for the poor and financial assistance to disabled adults. It also cut health care for \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  children; raised tuition for universities and community colleges; consolidated state agencies and commissions; established higher rates for state parks; along with a host of minor cuts and money transfers.\par \par \uc2 "The budget process begins in earnest now," Gregoire said after the revenue forecast. "We cannot trim our way out of it. We are going to have to make cuts, and they will be felt everywhere throughout the state."\par \par \uc2 Gregoire also reminded lawmakers that voters rejected taxes in the 2010 election. They shot down taxes to soda and income taxes for the rich. They also reinstated the rule that two-thirds of votes in each chamber are needed to raise taxes and fees.\par \par \uc2 Now it's time for Senate and House lawmakers to present their counterproposals. So far, Democrats have indicated a reluctance to cut as much as Gregoire proposed.\par \par \uc2 "These are hard decisions to do," Hunter said. "The problem has become more daunting."\par \par \uc2 Republicans are pushing for ideas that echo Gregoire's, and they view the bad fiscal shape as an opportunity to reshape the way state government works. Republicans in the Senate are also enjoying a bigger influence on the budget.\par \par \uc2 "Our priority for the several weeks remaining in this session should be clear: Come up with a budget and policy changes that together do what the governor recommended when our session began, which is to recognize that government cannot do it all," said Sen. Joe Zarelli, R-Ridgefield, the Senate GOP's budget chief.\par \par \uc2 The budget gap, though, includes projected costs for two voter-approved initiatives that reduce class sizes and give salary increases to teachers that would cost $1.1 billion. Lawmakers don't plan on funding those initiatives, so shave off $1 billion from the top.\par \par \uc2 This year the House is presenting their budget first, followed by the Senate.\par \par \uc2 Ideas to cut into the deficit abound. A proposal to expand electronic gambling in non-tribal venues has been floated. Supporters say $380 million per biennium could be raised. Another group is pushing for contracting the distribution of liquor to private firms for $300 million in a lump sum payment plus a share of the profits. A coalition of liberal groups have lobbied for ending tax breaks for corporations -- an idea that hasn't gotten much traction.\par \par \uc2 A budget gimmick that would push payments on state programs into the 2013-2015 biennium has also tested the water. The so called 25th-month proposal got a cold reception from Gregoire this past week. It took the state more than 15 years, she noted, to pay off the debt the state racked up the last time lawmakers used the maneuver.\par \par \uc2 Earlier this month, Rep. Kathy Haigh, D-Shelton, confirmed House Democrats are also considering borrowing money, with the interest to be paid by anticipated future revenues. Lawmakers took similar action earlier this decade, bonding against the hundreds of millions of dollars expected from the national tobacco settlement.\par \par \uc2 Gregoire shot that idea down as well, saying that the state ended up paying huge amounts of interest.\par \par \uc2 Conservative lawmakers have proposed re-opening state worker contracts to renegotiation, but Gregoire argues that state workers have already taken a fair share of wage reductions, furloughs and higher health care premiums negotiated last year.\par \par \uc2 "There are a lot of bad ideas in the world. Some are less bad than others. Some are very bad. We're going to try to do the least-bad set of options we can do," Hunter said.\par \par \uc2 But before lawmakers tackle the two-year budget, they still need to close a shortfall estimated to be about $200 million in this fiscal year, which ends in June.\par \par \uc2 Murray and Hunter said they will present another supplemental budget soon.\par \par \uc2 --------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writer Molly Rosbach and Associated Press writer Donna Blankinship in Seattle contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110320e73k002s5\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHOENIX (AP) - Arizona legislators took a timeout from illegal immigration with the Senate easily defeating five related bills, reflecting little appetite for an issue that made the state the focus of national debate and protest last year.\par \par \uc2 Majority Republicans were split Thursday in their votes on the defeated bills, which included two measures intended to force a U.S. Supreme Court ruling against automatic citizenship for U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants. The other three dealt with health care, public services and everyday activities such as driving.\par \par \uc2 Supporters of the measures voiced frustration and said there could be political fallout for lawmakers who voted against them.\par \par \uc2 "The lack of political courage" is the only impediment to step up pressure on illegal immigration, said Republican Sen. Russell Pearce, the sponsor of the 2010 law.\par \par \uc2 But business leaders have been urging lawmakers to put the issue aside to avoid damaging the still-ailing economy.\par \par \uc2 The 2010 law known as SB1070 resulted in protests, boycotts and legal challenges. A federal judge has put key provisions on hold.\par \par \uc2 "It's time for us to take a timeout," said Republican Sen. John McComish of Phoenix. "It's something that the people don't want us to be focusing on."\par \par \uc2 Critics also said the bills rejected Thursday were over-reaching and flawed.\par \par \uc2 The two bills on citizenship were defeated on votes of 12-18 and 11-19 as majority Republicans split on the issue. The chamber's nine Democrats voted against all of the bills.\par \par \uc2 "I'm hopeful that now we can move on and focus on the business of the state," Democratic Minority Leader David Schapira of Tempe said after the three-hour floor session.\par \par \uc2 One of the rejected bills would have required hospitals to contact federal immigration officials or local law enforcement if people being treated lack insurance and can't demonstrate legal status.\par \par \uc2 Critics said that would burden hospitals, but Republican Sen. Steve Smith of Maricopa said his bill didn't require much.\par \par \uc2 "Maybe you forgot it's illegal to be in this country illegally," he said during the vote on his bill. "We just ask them to report the crime, not be the judge and executioner."\par \par \uc2 Also defeated was a bill to require schools to file reports on enrollments of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students.\par \par \uc2 The fifth bill was a sweeping measure sponsored by Pearce. It would have made it a crime for illegal immigrants to drive in Arizona. It also had provisions on registering vehicles, workplace hiring and various public benefits.\par \par \uc2 It would ban illegal immigrants from attending Arizona's public universities and community colleges. The state does not now have a ban but it does require illegal immigrants to pay higher, non-resident tuition rates.\par \par \uc2 Pearce's bill also would have required eviction of public housing tenants who let illegal immigrants live with them and make applicants for vehicle titles and registration prove they are in the country legally.\par \par \uc2 Pearce and other supporters said cracking down on illegal immigration would provide relief to taxpayers by cutting costs for education, health care and other services.\par \par \uc2 Earlier Thursday, Gov. Jan Brewer said she didn't have positions on the bills and she declined to wave off legislators from taking up the issue of illegal immigration again.\par \par \uc2 "I believe that illegal immigration is an important subject to the populace in Arizona and is something that probably needs to be further addressed," said Brewer, a Republican who signed SB1070 into law.\par \par \uc2 Dozens of CEOs of major employers and business groups signed a letter distributed Wednesday by the Greater Phoenix Chamber of Commerce, saying that passage of additional legislation on illegal immigration would damage the economy and tourism.\par \par \uc2 Arizona should instead push for federal action on immigration and border issues, according to the letter signed by heads of construction companies, hospitals, real estate developers and \uc2 US Airways\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "Arizona's lawmakers and citizens are right to be concerned about illegal immigration," the letter said. "But we must acknowledge that when Arizona goes it alone on this issue, unintended consequences inevitably occur."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110318e73i0000c\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHOENIX (AP) - The Arizona Senate on Thursday defeated bills intended to force a Supreme Court ruling against automatic citizenship for U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 The bills were defeated on votes of 12-18 and 11-19 as majority Republicans split on the issue.\par \par \uc2 The Senate also defeated a bill to require hospitals to contact federal immigration officials or local law enforcement if people being treated lack insurance and can't demonstrate legal status. Also defeated was a bill to require schools to file reports on enrollments of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students.\par \par \uc2 The Senate was poised to vote on a sweeping bill dealing with other public services and everyday activities ranging from driving to registering vehicles.\par \par \uc2 Supporters said the measures would provide relief to taxpayers while opponents said passing new laws on the contentious issue would damage the state's still-ailing economy.\par \par \uc2 "If we trying to re-create Arizona's economy and bring jobs, this is not how to do it," said Democratic Sen. Steve Gallard of Phoenix.\par \par \uc2 The legislation is being considered a year after Arizona enacted an illegal immigration law on local enforcement. It resulted in protests, boycotts and legal challenges that caused a federal judge to put key provisions on hold.\par \par \uc2 Earlier Thursday, Gov. Jan Brewer refused to wave off legislators from taking up the contentious issue of illegal immigration again.\par \par \uc2 Dozens of CEOs of major employers and business groups signed a letter distributed Wednesday by the Greater Phoenix Chamber of Commerce, saying that passage of additional legislation on illegal immigration would damage the economy and tourism.\par \par \uc2 Arizona should instead push for federal action on immigration and border issues, according to the letter signed by heads of construction companies, hospitals, real estate developers and \uc2 US Airways\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "Arizona's lawmakers and citizens are right to be concerned about illegal immigration," the letter said. "But we must acknowledge that when Arizona goes it alone on this issue, unintended consequences inevitably occur."\par \par \uc2 One of the new measures is a wide-ranging bill sponsored by Pearce, who sponsored the 2010 law.\par \par \uc2 "Enough is enough," said Republican Sen. Russell Pearce, a supporter of the hospitals bill and the other measures. "Why are we afraid to enforce the law and report criminal activity?"\par \par \uc2 Pearce's new bill would make it harder for illegal immigrants to live, work and get an education in Arizona. It would require the parents of students at K-12 schools to prove the citizenship of their children, bar illegal immigrants from attending public universities and prohibit illegal immigrants from driving in the state.\par \par \uc2 It also would require the eviction of public housing tenants who let illegal immigrants live with them and make applicants for vehicle titles and registration prove they are in the country legally.\par \par \uc2 Under the bill, it would be a crime for illegal immigrants to drive in Arizona, The bill would suspend business licenses of employers who purposely ignore a state mandate to use a federal identification database to check new hires' eligibility.\par \par \uc2 Two bills would set new criteria to get Arizona birth certificates and form a compact with other states, both in an attempt to force a U.S. Supreme Court ruling on whether U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants are entitled to automatic citizenship.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110317e73h0028r\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Houston Chronicle. March 12, 2011\par \par \uc2 Hear ye, hear ye: Public notices regarding public money need to be where we'll see them -- in newspapers\par \par \uc2 Timely access to information: Nothing is more crucial to the smooth functioning of the institutions of our democracy. And nothing is more fundamental to that access than the traditional published public notice in the newspaper. It spreads the word about meeting agendas, bidding processes for contracts and other nuts and bolts of the operation of agencies large and small financed with public dollars.\par \par \uc2 Published notices in newspapers are the time-honored successors to the town criers of old. They get the word out so that voters -- taxpayers -- can be in the know. They do so efficiently, economically and impartially. Importantly in this Internet age, they also do so electronically, via newspaper websites, as well as a statewide newspaper industry website that aggregates all public notices from Texas papers in one place, independently operated and not run by the government ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.txhead"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.txhead}}}\uc2  lines.com/index.php/public--notices).\par \par \uc2 That venerable method of informing the public is being put at risk in Texas by a movement in the Legislature to amend the public notice process for our 1,000-plus school boards and 254 county governments, as well as our municipal governments.\par \par \uc2 Spearheading this ill-advised effort is HB 507, by Rep. Angie Chen Button, (R-Richardson), that would allow school districts, municipalities and counties to move some public notices on bids to the Internet.\par \par \uc2 We acknowledge, up front, our self-interest. Publishing public notices creates a revenue stream for newspapers, albeit a relatively small one in many cases. By law, Texas newspapers must charge their lowest classified rate for public notices.\par \par \uc2 To do the same job newspapers already do, governments would have to spend thousands of additional taxpayer dollars for secure servers, programming, posting and auditing. So much for the cost-benefit argument for changing over.\par \par \uc2 The prospect of posting competitive bidding notices on the websites of the public entities -- school districts, cities and counties -- without some independent oversight is particularly alarming. These are your tax dollars. Competitive bidding notices should be published in a newspaper, where they can be seen by all taxpayers.\par \par \uc2 Newspapers are watchdogs. We routinely monitor and report the acts of government. This is a benefit that no government entity can possibly provide in this important area.\par \par \uc2 We hope state lawmakers will bring discernment and judgment to their review of this issue and continue the requirement that public notices be published in newspapers.\par \par \uc2 A majority of Texans rely on their local newspaper as the primary source of information in their community.\par \par \uc2 This is where such vital information concerning taxpayer dollars should be placed.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 The Dallas Morning News. March 11, 2011\par \par \uc2 Texas should kill its especially bad driver policy\par \par \uc2 The Texas Driver Responsibility Program, passed in 2003 as part of an omnibus legislative bill, was never good public policy. In short, it tacks on surcharges of hundreds or even thousands of dollars for selected driving offenses, including DWI and failure to produce valid insurance.\par \par \uc2 The money was supposed to go to trauma care centers and highways, which would have been fine goals if the state actually collected much of it. Instead, far too many Texas drivers proved too poor or too irresponsible to pay these on-top-of-everything-else penalties.\par \par \uc2 How many? According to the Department of Public Safety -- which receives 1 percent of the surcharge cash to administer the program -- Texas had billed drivers for $2.2 billion in surcharges through January 2010.\par \par \uc2 Amount collected: $871 million. Tap your calculator keys, and you find that's less than 40 percent.\par \par \uc2 And since drivers who refuse to pay lose their licenses, some legislators rightly worry that Texas is "creating a new class of criminals each day" by adding to the state's estimated 1.2 million unlicensed and uninsured drivers.\par \par \uc2 Legislation is moving through both houses to repeal the law, which is a start. The state also put in an amnesty program for drivers cited between 2004 and 2008 to settle their fines at a sharp discount, which sounds good unless you're like Ann Sutter of Waxahachie.\par \par \uc2 She says she paid hundreds of dollars in surcharges to keep her son -- cited for no insurance when driving a friend's car -- street legal. Sutter, a single mother, swallowed hard and followed the law, no matter how difficult. Amnesty obviously does her no good, since she paid up as the state demanded.\par \par \uc2 "I want my money back," she says.\par \par \uc2 On a human level, it's hard to argue with her. She's among the four-in-10 penalized for being law-abiding citizens. It must gall her to see the other six get a sweet deal for refusing to pay. (And it must doubly gall her that fewer than 10 percent of the more than 700,000 eligible drivers have bothered to sign up for amnesty.)\par \par \uc2 We might be inclined to insist the state return all surcharges collected under an obviously flawed statute, except we recognize that this might not be the right time to blow a new $1 billion hole in the state budget. It might be the right thing to do on a simple fairness level, but with Texas grappling with a shortfall up to $20 billion and painful cuts ahead, this isn't the time.\par \par \uc2 What the state could do is immediately stop collecting the surcharges and extend the amnesty to everyone cited, not just those within the 2004-08 window.\par \par \uc2 And it almost goes without saying that the Legislature should kill the Driver Responsibility Program and, hopefully, learn something valuable from the experience. If not, our lawmakers make it increasingly difficult to respect any laws they might pass in the future.\par \par \uc2 The program, passed in 2003, adds surcharges of hundreds or even thousands of dollars to selected driving offenses, including DWI and driving without insurance. Statistics since 2003 (through January 2010):\par \par \uc2 Number of drivers cited for surcharges: 1.8 million\par \par \uc2 Surcharges billed: $2.2 billion\par \par \uc2 Surcharges collected: $871 million\par \par \uc2 Drivers licenses suspended for failure to pay: 1.2\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Star-Telegram. March 12, 2011\par \par \uc2 Texas Gov. Rick Perry's alternate reality: Blame schools for teacher job cuts\par \par \uc2 It was a classic Perry bomb: Officials in Austin aren't to blame if public school teachers lose their jobs amid state budget cuts, Gov. Rick Perry recently said. If you want to blame someone, blame local school boards.\par \par \uc2 "As a matter of fact," he added for emphasis, "the lieutenant governor, the speaker and their colleagues aren't going to hire or fire one teacher, as best I can tell."\par \par \uc2 To keep the record straight, the Texas Constitution puts the burden squarely on the state to create and fund a public education system.\par \par \uc2 But there's no good reason to blame anyone -- yet -- for the sorry funding outlook for school budgets next year. Because of the economic downturn, the initial outlook for state spending over the next two years devotes $9.8 billion less to schools than what current funding formulas would require.\par \par \uc2 That would put the state paying about 42 percent of total state and local school spending, down from 50.1 percent in fiscal 2008.\par \par \uc2 State officials who are working to put together the best budget they can seem to harbor no doubt that the results will be painful.\par \par \uc2 Shortly after the Perry bomb exploded, Education Commissioner Robert Scott testified at a meeting of the House Appropriations Committee. Scott is an appointee and close associate of the governor. He's a devoted administrator who runs a tight ship at the Texas Education Agency, but he's clearly frustrated.\par \par \uc2 There's a "fundamental disconnect" between those initial state budget numbers and the high expectations for students set by the Legislature and TEA in recent years.\par \par \uc2 "You've set us on a goal of college and career readiness (for students)," Scott said. "We are marching toward that goal, and you have set a (spending) bill that is $9.8 billion below what the current law in other statutes says you're supposed to generate."\par \par \uc2 The goals adopted by lawmakers include building better math and science skills and adopting rigorous end-of-course exams for high school students.\par \par \uc2 Texas teachers remain capable of educating the state's young people, Scott said. But "with the resources you have given them, they will not be able to achieve the goals you have set for them."\par \par \uc2 He offered two alternatives: reduce expectations for Texas public education or allocate more money -- about $6.1 billion more -- to schools than the initial budget contemplates.\par \par \uc2 School administrators would still be more than $3 billion shy of what they had expected, but it's certain they'd prefer that to being $9.8 billion in the hole.\par \par \uc2 Perry's suggestion: Cut non-teaching school employees, not teachers.\par \par \uc2 Despite frequent complaints about high-paid superintendents and their staffs, TEA figures show the 25,700 school administrators, superintendents included, earn a total of less than $2 billion a year. The 61,000 school support staff members earn $3.5 billion a year.\par \par \uc2 You'd have to cut almost all of those jobs to reach the $9.8 billion two-year budget cutting goal. No one should believe the schools would operate well without most of those people.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Amarillo Globe-News. March 10, 2011\par \par \uc2 Get serious on immigration\par \par \uc2 State Rep. Debbie Riddle has unveiled one of the most ridiculous pieces of legislation in memory.\par \par \uc2 The Houston -- area Republican wants the Texas Legislature to enact a law that makes it illegal for employers to hire illegal immigrants, unless they are -- and this is no joke, even though it sounds like one -- a maid or a gardener.\par \par \uc2 There's no need here to itemize the ghastly stereotyping examples that this legislation brings to mind.\par \par \uc2 Suffice to say that exempting gardeners or maids falls into the category of gross insult to Texas residents of Hispanic descent, given that virtually all illegal immigrants living in Texas come across the border from Mexico.\par \par \uc2 Riddle's response to the criticism from many quarters is bizarre as well. Homeowners or business owners need not be afraid to hire illegal immigrants to do work around the house, Riddle says.\par \par \uc2 What in the world ... ?\par \par \uc2 Yes, Texas and the three other states -- New Mexico, Arizona and California -- that sit on our nation's border with Mexico have an illegal immigration crisis.\par \par \uc2 Arizona has taken controversial steps to deal with the issue, declaring that if the feds won't solve the problem, it should fall on the states to take matters into their own hands.\par \par \uc2 Texas well could follow suit before the 2011 Legislature adjourns in late May.\par \par \uc2 But the state also has an enormous budget deficit, the size of which has yet to be determined.\par \par \uc2 Both issues -- immigration and the budget -- require serious solutions.\par \par \uc2 Rep. Riddle's goofball \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  hiring bill doesn't even come close to deserving the Legislature's attention.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110317e73h001u1\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 DENVER (AP) - A bill signing turned a bit personal Thursday for Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper. Before signing into law a "Blue Alert" system to help nab people suspected of hurting peace officers, the governor embraced a Denver woman whose husband was killed in 2005 by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  working at a restaurant partly owned by Hickenlooper.\par \par \uc2 The woman was Kelly Young, the widow of Denver Det. Donald "Donnie" Young, who was shot to death in 2005 while working off-duty security for a private baptismal party.\par \par \uc2 The detective's shooter briefly escaped to his native Mexico before being extradited back to Colorado and convicted of murder. At the time of the shooting, Raul Garcia-Gomez was working at the Cherry Cricket restaurant.\par \par \uc2 Hickenlooper was mayor of Denver at the time but had put his portion of the establishment into a blind trust and didn't have any control over hiring.\par \par \uc2 Hickenlooper, who attended Donald Young's funeral, embraced a smiling Kelly Young on Thursday and asked, "How are the kids?" The widow smiled back and the governor turned to sign the bill.\par \par \uc2 Before the ceremony, she praised the governor and state lawmakers for making Colorado the 10th state with Blue Alert notifications.\par \par \uc2 "I think it sends a big message that the killing of police officers is not going to be stood for in Colorado," Kelly Young said.\par \par \uc2 The state's Fraternal Order of Police backed the new law, which takes effect next January.\par \par \uc2 "This is the right thing to do for those who put themselves on the line," Hickenlooper said.\par \par \uc2 The governor also signed into law four other bills Thursday. They included a new requirement that state notifications about ballot initiatives include information about how the initiatives originated, and a bill allowing school clinics to waive co-pay requirement for sick pupils.\par \par \uc2 Hickenlooper was headed to a Denver day-care center Friday morning to sign into law a bill streamlining background-check requirements for child-care facilities with common owners.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110317e73h000ph\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

Senate approves anti-illegal immigration bill that allows police to seize property\b0\par\par\uc2 621 \uc2 words\par \uc2 16 March 2011\par 19:17\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2011.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) - A sweeping anti-illegal immigration bill that gives police broad powers to arrest illegal immigrants and seize property used to commit immigration-related crimes cleared the Oklahoma Senate on Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 The Senate voted 29-15 for the bill by Sen. Ralph Shortey, R-Oklahoma City, over the objections of some members who say the plan is unconstitutional and would be detrimental to Oklahoma's economy.\par \par \uc2 "I believe the language has constitutional problems," said Sen. Clark Jolley, R-Edmond, who tried to remove several sections of the bill he said were problematic. "This puts a burden on legal citizens to carry citizenship papers at all times."\par \par \uc2 The Senate approved a separate bill on Wednesday that denies in-state tuition to illegal immigrants who attended high school in Oklahoma.\par \par \uc2 "There's nothing wrong with coming here legally. We welcome you," said Sen. Anthony Sykes, R-Moore, who wrote the tuition bill. "This is about the people who cut to the front of the line and do it illegally."\par \par \uc2 Illegal immigrants were banned from receiving in-state tuition at state colleges in a tough anti-illegal immigration bill approved several years ago, but an exemption was granted for students seeking citizenship who already were planning to attend college. Sykes' bill eliminates those exemptions.\par \par \uc2 Shortey's measure authorizes law enforcement officers to arrest someone without a warrant if the officer has "probable cause" to believe the person is subject to a removal order by an immigration court, has been charged with a crime, or has failed to register with the federal government. It also allows police to seize property, like homes or vehicles, used to knowingly harbor or transport illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 "This is going to remove an incentive for an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  to come to Oklahoma in the first place," said Shortey, who represents a heavily Hispanic district in south Oklahoma City. "They're going to say: 'Oklahoma doesn't like us. They don't want us there. So we just won't go.'\par \par \uc2 "If they're faced with the possibility of being detained at any moment in Oklahoma, then they'll go someplace else."\par \par \uc2 Another provision of Shortey's bill requires employers who receive any economic incentive from the state to use a federal program called e-verify to confirm the immigration status of their workers.\par \par \uc2 Sen. Charles Wyrick, who represents a rural district in northeast Oklahoma, said he's concerned farmers could risk losing their property and expensive equipment by hiring migrant workers, even if the workers were later determined to be legal.\par \par \uc2 "(A farmer's) entire operation could be shut down until forfeiture is declared or a release is ordered," said Wyrick, D-Fairland. "Do you have any idea how much crop would be lost if an entire harvesting operation were shut down for 30 days?"\par \par \uc2 Patricia Fennell, president and CEO of the Latino Community Development Agency, accused politicians like Shortey of pandering to voters and using controversial issues like immigration to boost their support.\par \par \uc2 "They're using these bills to build political careers," Fennell said. "These people will eventually self-destruct, but they leave a path of destruction in people's lives in the meantime."\par \par \uc2 Although Shortey's bill is expected to be heavily amended during the conference committee process, Fennell said it's irresponsible for Republican leaders in the Senate to allow the bill to come to the floor for a vote.\par \par \uc2 "I think it's incredibly irresponsible when your state is in serious economic crisis, and you pass bills that you know are not good for this state and are going to be legally challenged and result in economic costs," Fennell said.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110316e73g00273\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 FORT BELVOIR, Va. (AP) - This week's arrest of an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  charged in a fatal crash in Fairfax County is again focusing attention on federal efforts to detain aliens accused of drunken driving.\par \par \uc2 Police charged Carlos Sanchez-Ramos, 33, of Springfield with aggravated involuntary manslaughter, driving while intoxicated and other counts.\par \par \uc2 Authorities say he lost control of his car on Richmond Highway on Monday, striking a Ford Fusion and pushing it into oncoming traffic. The Fusion was struck head on, killing 54-year-old Paul Krause of Fairfax Station. Police say Sanchez-Ramos fled the scene with a 3-year-old boy. He was arrested a short distance away.\par \par \uc2 Sanchez-Ramos entered the country illegally and was deported to Honduras in 2004, but returned to the U.S. between his deportation and 2007, according to immigration authorities.\par \par \uc2 In November 2007, Sanchez-Ramos was arrested in Fairfax County and charged with drunken driving. At the time, Fairfax authorities did not check to see if those arrested were illegal immigrants and no effort was made by immigration authorities to detain or deport him.\par \par \uc2 Fairfax has been conducting those checks since March 2009 of virtually all people who are arrested and booked by sheriff's deputies under a partnership with the Bureau of Immigration and Customs enforcement (ICE) called Secure Communities.\par \par \uc2 The case is reminiscent of an August crash in neighboring Prince William county that killed a Benedictine nun. The man accused in that case is 23-year-old Carlos Montano, who arrived in the United States from Bolivia with his family as a 9-year-old boy and was not detained by immigration authorities despite several arrests on drunken driving charges.\par \par \uc2 ICE says it is focusing on detaining and deporting criminal aliens who commit serious crimes. But it is not clear exactly where drunken driving falls on that list of serious crimes.\par \par \uc2 In a report released earlier this month looking into the circumstances of Montano's case, which caused an uproar in Prince William County and among activists nationwide, ICE said that nationally it "simply does not have the funding that would be required to detain all aliens charged with or convicted of DUI offenses."\par \par \uc2 Although the ICE report concluded that Montano would likely have been detained under existing policy because he was a repeat offender and a demonstrated threat to public safety, ICE policy is explicit in focusing attention first on those who commit "aggravated felonies" like murder and rape and then on illegal immigrants convicted of felonies or at least three misdemeanors. In most states, under most circumstances, driving while intoxicated is a misdemeanor offense.\par \par \uc2 ICE spokeswoman Nicole Navas said that "every case is evaluated on its own merits." In Fairfax County, statistics show that since the secure Communities program was implemented, 1,595 illegal aliens have been arrested or booked into custody by administrative authorities as a result of matches found through the program's database. But the numbers also show that an immigration arrest is seven times more likely to occur in cases involving aggravated felonies than with cases involving routine felonies or misdemeanors.\par \par \uc2 Lt. Sonny Cachuela, spokesman for the Fairfax County Sheriff's Department, said anybody who is fingerprinted, regardless of race or ethnicity, is submitted to the national database that allows ICE to lodge a detainer. It is completely up to ICE, though, to decide when it seeks a detainer. It has lodged a detainer for Sanchez-Ramos.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110316e73g001ku\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) - When Alabama legislators return from spring break next week, they could take up a sweeping Republican-backed Arizona-style immigration bill that would make it harder for illegal immigrants to get jobs or apply for government benefits.\par \par \uc2 The bill would cause employers to lose their business licenses if they knowingly hire illegal immigrants and would make it a felony crime for illegal immigrants to register to vote. The bill also requires anyone applying for government benefits to show proof of citizenship or legal residency.\par \par \uc2 The bill's sponsor, Republican Rep. Micky Hammon of Decatur, says it would give Alabama a commonsense law that would allow law enforcement officers to enforce federal immigration laws.\par \par \uc2 Opponents say the bill would encourage police officers to racially profile Hispanics and would make it more difficult for immigrants, even those who are in the country legally, to get jobs.\par \par \uc2 "This is a step backward for Alabama. It's a step back to Jim Crow laws and the Bull Connor fire hoses," said Isabel Rubio, director of The Hispanic Interest Coalition of Alabama, referring to Alabama's past days of segregation and the former Birmingham police commissioner who directed fire hoses to be sprayed at demonstrators.\par \par \uc2 Rubio was one of the speakers last week as about 200 people rallied in front of the Statehouse against the bill.\par \par \uc2 Hammon, the majority leader in the House, said his bill does not allow racial profiling and only allows police officers to check on someone's immigration status after they have been pulled over for a violation such as speeding or running a red light. He said the officer must then suspect that the driver or a passenger if an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "I feel like this bill would solve the problem with illegal immigrants in Alabama," Hammon said.\par \par \uc2 He said the bill is part of the Republican "handshake with Alabama," a list of proposed legislation the GOP promised to make a priority in winning control of the Legislature last year. He said the bill is on the calendar in the House and could come up for a vote next week.\par \par \uc2 The proposed legislation scares Claudia Hendley of Homewood, who moved to the United States 10 years ago from Colombia and currently works with Hispanic women and children who have been the victims of abuse.\par \par \uc2 "It's going to make victims of domestic violence afraid to go to the courthouse. You're going to have more crime happening," Hendley said.\par \par \uc2 Hendley said she came to America after meeting and falling in love with a U.S. citizen who was vacationing in Colombia. But she said immigrants come here for many different reasons.\par \par \uc2 "The come looking for a better life, for better education for their children. They come because they believe this to be a free country where everybody is treated equal," Hendley said.\par \par \uc2 If the immigration bill passes, she said she fears many people will lose their jobs, even those who are in the country legally.\par \par \uc2 The bill is supported by leadership in the Legislature, including House Speaker Mike Hubbard of Auburn.\par \par \uc2 Hubbard disputed claims from critics that the bill unfairly targets Hispanics and would lead to racial profiling. He said the aim of the bill is to crack down on illegal aliens.\par \par \uc2 "The operative word is illegal. We have no problem with people who are here legally," Hubbard said.\par \par \uc2 Hammon's proposed legislation would require employers to use a federal system called "e-verify" to determine if new workers are in the country legally. Employers who then knowingly hire illegal immigrants face having their business licenses suspended for a first offense and can lose their license all together for a second offense.\par \par \uc2 One proponent of tougher immigration laws, Elois Zeanah, president of the Alabama Federation of Republican Women, said she is concerned the bill does not go far enough -- that it should provide stiffer penalties for business owners who knowingly hire illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 "My concern is that those employers who don't use 'e-verify' be punished," said Zeanah of Tuscaloosa. She said she believes controlling access to jobs is the secret to solving the illegal immigration problem.\par \par \uc2 "If you get rid of the jobs then they are going to leave," Zeanah said.\par \par \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110315e73f0037m\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

Hernandez was patrolling the Westlake neighborhood by bicycle at the time and had been flagged down by people concerned about a man wielding a knife.\par \par \uc2 Several witnesses told police they saw a drunken Jaminez holding a knife, but some in the community did not believe the police account. At least one woman who saw the shooting said Jaminez was not holding a weapon.\par \par \uc2 The fatal shooting sparked three successive nights of street protests and angry confrontations between residents and police.\par \par \uc2 Outraged protesters said police should have handled the situation differently, using pepper spray or a Taser to immobilize Jaminez, instead of shooting him in the head.\par \par \uc2 Police Chief Charlie Beck said at the time the shooting was a justifiable use of force by a 13-year department veteran. He and other top brass expressed surprise at the vehement community reaction, but residents said that showed how out of touch police are with the neighborhood.\par \par \uc2 Tension had been simmering over police crackdowns on illegal sidewalk vending, which many immigrants have had to take up to eke out a living in view of the dearth of construction and other jobs.\par \par \uc2 Jaminez was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who hailed from a small village in the highlands of Guatemala and was trying to make money to send back to his wife and three children.\par \par \uc2 Beck and Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa have scheduled a press conference after the report is released by the Police Commission around 12:30 p.m.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110315e73f001kq\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHOENIX (AP) - The Arizona Senate on Monday gave preliminary approval to bills that would make it more difficult for illegal immigrants to find jobs and get public housing in the state.\par \par \uc2 The Senate's action represents a dry run of sorts for wider legislation targeting illegal immigration that could be considered later this week. The broader bill includes versions of both bills considered Monday.\par \par \uc2 One of the bills would require public housing applicants to prove they are U.S citizens or legal residents. It also would require eviction of residents who let an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  live with them in public housing.\par \par \uc2 The second bill bars people who can't prove they are in the U.S. legally from getting a state fingerprint background check card. Those cards are needed for many work permits.\par \par \uc2 Senate President Russell Pearce, the sponsor of the broader bill, said he anticipates Senate passage of it and other pending illegal immigration measures on citizenship and hospital admissions. The Mesa Republican was the sponsor of a controversial illegal immigration bill on local law enforcement that was approved last year, though key provisions have been put on hold by a judge.\par \par \uc2 Republican legislators ran for election or re-election last year on platforms calling for action against illegal immigration, he noted. "It's a critical issue and we intend to perform," Pearce said.\par \par \uc2 The new, broader bill also includes provisions to require parents of K-12 school students to prove the citizenship of their children, to bar illegal immigrants from driving and to bar them from attending public universities and community colleges.\par \par \uc2 Two measures on citizenship are intended to launch a legal challenge to automatic U.S. citizenship for children of illegal immigrants. The bill on hospitals would require them to check the immigration status of patients who can't provide proof of insurance.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110314e73e002qr\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SHOUSHA CAMP, Tunisia (AP) - Thousands of African and Asian migrant workers who fled Libya after years of toil are going home with empty pockets and many vow never to return.\par \par \uc2 Huddling in a sand-swept Tunisian transit camp near the border with Libya, laborers said they were often cheated by their Libyan bosses even before they were stripped of their remaining cash on their way out of the country.\par \par \uc2 Those at Shousha Camp are among hundreds of thousands of foreign workers believed to have left Libya since the start of the uprising against Libyan ruler Moammar Gadhafi a month ago.\par \par \uc2 Their chaotic exodus highlights oil-rich Libya's often problematic role as a regional magnet for migrant workers. In the past, analysts say, Gadhafi often invited or expelled migrants in line with his political needs.\par \par \uc2 Data is sketchy, but according to one estimate, as many as 2.5 million foreigners -- on par with Libya's own domestic labor force -- worked in the North African nation before the current crisis. In recent years, as Libya emerged from crippling international sanctions, the foreigners filled jobs Libyans didn't want or weren't trained for, including in construction, oil and health services.\par \par \uc2 For the most vulnerable Asian and African migrant workers -- those who didn't have the backing of their government or a foreign company or were in Libya illegally -- the hasty departure marks the close of a bitter chapter in their lives.\par \par \uc2 "I am going home with nothing," said John Adjei, a 33-year-old construction worker from Ghana who had just arrived at the transit camp, waiting to be assigned a tent. In eight years in Libya, he said he was robbed twice, most recently en route to the Tunisian border. As an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , he had no recourse, including against bosses who refused to pay him.\par \par \uc2 Many Bangladeshis at the camp said they incurred debt to go to Libya, paying on average $5,000 to a local broker for the plane ticket and visa. Now, some said, they don't know how to pay it back.\par \par \uc2 After the outbreak of fighting, China, Turkey, Egypt and others evacuated their workers from Libya by air and sea. Workers without outside help, including Bangladeshis and many of the Africans, had to organize their own treks to safety in neighboring countries, mainly Tunisia and Egypt.\par \par \uc2 More than 260,000 people crossed into Tunisia and Egypt since the start of the fighting, including nearly 100,000 non-Egyptian foreign workers, according to the International Organization for Migration, which is helping to evacuate stranded laborers. Up to 6,000 people continue leave Libya for Tunisia and Egypt every day, the group said.\par \par \uc2 Many of those who reach Tunisia -- the most hazardous route since it leads through Gadhafi-controlled territory -- find temporary refuge at the 20,000-capacity Shousha Camp, run by the Tunisian army and international aid groups.\par \par \uc2 On Saturday, as a sand storm whipped across the camp, thousands of migrants walked around aimlessly in the garbage-strewn tent city, killing time as aid agencies tried to arrange flights home. Many had already been there for several days. Long lines formed for food, water and free three-minute phone calls.\par \par \uc2 Occasionally, one group would organize a protest to try to speed up the pace of evacuations. On Saturday, several dozen ran up and down the main road next to the camp, shouting "Mali, Mali," the name of their home country, and waving sticks in the air. Tunisian soldiers watched from the sidelines and the group quickly dispersed.\par \par \uc2 Many of the workers said they would never have left home had they known what awaited them. Virtually all said they were robbed by pro-Gadhafi forces en route to the border. Most said they were stiffed at times by their Libyan bosses, and some of the Africans said they had been beaten or detained.\par \par \uc2 Tarun Alam, 22, said his family had sold most of its land in Bangladesh so it could send him to work in Libya. He was promised a salary of $600 a month, or three times what he would make at home. Instead, he was not paid at all on the first job. He quit after three months, found work as a cook and waiter and made between $300 and $400.\par \par \uc2 Earlier this week, he and several Bangladeshi co-workers left the Libyan capital of Tripoli because their company had shut down due to the fighting, leaving them to fend for themselves. On the way to the border, their bus was stopped by security forces who seized cash and phone cards. Alam said he lost his last $100 and his phone.\par \par \uc2 Workers from sub-Saharan Africa, perhaps worst off in Libya because many had entered illegally, started arriving in growing numbers at the camp in recent days. Migration officials said it's impossible to say how many more are on the way, since some might be afraid to make the trip or can't afford it.\par \par \uc2 Adjei, the construction worker, said he entered Libya eight years ago through the Sahara Desert, paying smugglers hundreds of dollars. Without proper papers, he said he had no recourse when cheated by his employers.\par \par \uc2 The Ghanaian said that three years ago, assailants set fire to a small Tripoli apartment he shared with four co-workers and made off with the group's shared earnings of $14,000. Adjei said he didn't leave Libya then because he felt he couldn't go home empty-handed; his income helps support his parents and two high school-age siblings.\par \par \uc2 In December, he was picked up by police for not having a visa and was taken to prison, sleeping on the ground without a mattress and enduring beatings by the guards. He was released 10 weeks later, after friends managed to collect enough money for bribes. When he came out, the fighting had already started.\par \par \uc2 En route to Tunisia, Libyan security forces took his remaining $1,200.\par \par \uc2 Gadhafi, in power since 1969, has in the past used foreign workers for his political objectives.\par \par \uc2 He has alternately championed pan-Arabism and pan-Africanism, opening and closing Libya to workers from those areas in line with Libya's orientation at the time. Different groups of workers could suddenly find themselves targeted for deportation, such as thousands of Sudanese expelled in the mid-1990s.\par \par \uc2 A turning point came in 2003 when Libya accepted responsibility for the 1988 bombing of a U.S. airliner that killed 270 people, mostly Americans, over Lockerbie, Scotland. Libya's change of heart led to a lifting of the sanctions, and in following years, the country moved toward normalizing its relations with the West.\par \par \uc2 Emerging from its isolation, Libya was eager to build its infrastructure and started bringing in more foreign workers since it didn't have the needed manpower, said Laurence Hart of the International Organization for Migration.\par \par \uc2 Hart said that before the fighting, his agency had been trying to work with the Libyan authorities to set up some rules and rights for the foreign workers. While the response was often slow, government officials showed some openness, he said. Some workers were treated well, and others were not, he added.\par \par \uc2 About half a million foreign workers are still in Libya, a country of 6.5 million, Hart estimated.\par \par \uc2 It's not clear if any will eventually return.\par \par \uc2 Adjei, the construction worker from Ghana, said he would try to build a life in his country, despite the economic difficulties. "I'm very tired of hustling in someone else's country. I just want to go home and have some peace," he said.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110314e73e0010d\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) - An anti-illegal immigration bill that requires police officers to try to check suspects' legal status headed Thursday to the South Carolina House, where its GOP majority lists the issue among its top priorities.\par \par \uc2 The South Carolina Senate voted 34-9 to advance the bill, roughly 12 hours after a post-midnight vote of 28-8 gave it provisional approval.\par \par \uc2 Its main sponsor, Sen. Larry Grooms, said the late-night changes strengthened the measure. They included making it a felony to sell or produce fake driver's licenses or other picture IDs for illegal immigrants. Punishment would be a $25,000 fine, up to five years in prison, or both.\par \par \uc2 "Hopefully, we'll lead the nation in illegal immigrants self-deporting," said Grooms, R-Bonneau. He believes that would create job openings in a state struggling with high unemployment.\par \par \uc2 The state leader of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People dismissed the bill as a political stunt to gear for the 2012 elections.\par \par \uc2 "We're doing political things, not human things," Lonnie Randolph said.\par \par \uc2 The bill specifies the status check must follow a traffic stop or arrest for something else. Someone with a valid driver's license, military ID or passport would be presumed a legal resident. If officers suspect someone is in the country illegally, they would have to call Immigrations and Custom Enforcement.\par \par \uc2 But Senate leaders contend the bill makes an important distinction from the Arizona law that's being challenged in court, in that South Carolina officers couldn't hold someone strictly over suspicions about their immigration status.\par \par \uc2 "We didn't cross that line that invites a challenge," said Sen. Larry Martin, R-Pickens, who led a subcommittee on the bill.\par \par \uc2 It specifies that suspicion can't be based on race, color or national origin. But opponents contend that clause is meaningless and, in practice, the bill legalizes racial profiling. They say it's is a waste of time and money in a year when lawmakers are cutting basic services.\par \par \uc2 "We're broke, and the last time I checked, we're not on a border," said Rep. Bakari Sellers, D-Denmark. "I'm tired of conservative Republicans spending money on agenda items when there's no money to spend."\par \par \uc2 In an effort to monitor potential profiling, Sen. Gerald Malloy, D-Hartsville, successfully proposed requiring officers to collect information on vehicle stops that initiate a legal status query, including the driver's age, gender, race and ethnicity.\par \par \uc2 Sen. Robert Ford continued Thursday to argue the bill would hurt the economy, saying immigrants are needed to do the manual labor that citizens won't do.\par \par \uc2 "Everybody in America knows that. The hard work right now in this country is going to be done by Latino or Mexican workers," said Ford, D-Charleston. "It might get my good friends in the Republican Party elected, but then who is going to go do the work?"\par \par \uc2 For days, the debate focused on a proposal by Sen. Jake Knotts to make it a state crime to be an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . His amendment would have required a one-year prison sentence on first offense, and five years on three or more.\par \par \uc2 "People don't understand why it's legal to be in South Carolina illegally," said Knotts, R-West Columbia, who at one point told his colleagues to get some backbone. Voters don't understand that it's a federal issue, he said.\par \par \uc2 He said requiring a phone call to the immigration service is just feel-good legislation.\par \par \uc2 But other Republican senators, including Grooms, argued that would conflict with federal law and open up the state to lawsuits, which would fall to taxpayers to fund. Senate Majority Leader Harvey Peeler, R-Gaffney, said keeping people in prison on such a crime would be expensive, noting the state spends $15,000 a year per prisoner.\par \par \uc2 Martin pleaded with fellow senators not to pass something that would ultimately doom the measure.\par \par \uc2 Knotts eventually withdrew that proposal in favor of a compromise that creates a new unit within the Department of Public Safety to enforce illegal immigration laws, expected to consist of 10 officers. The cost of that is unknown.\par \par \uc2 "The bill has some teeth in it now," Knotts said. "It's going to be hard to stay here illegally."\par \par \uc2 But he added that the downside is that farmers and others do need migrant labor. Congress must come up with a better work permit system, he said. It's the federal government's fault for making the process of coming to America as a legal immigrant so lengthy and complicated, he said.\par \par \uc2 The Senate also added a fee to wire transfers from within South Carolina to outside the country, in an attempt to tax money sent by illegal immigrants back to their relatives. It would tack $5 to a wire transfer of less than $500. Amounts above that would be charged a 1 percent fee. Collections would be used to fund that new immigration enforcement unit.\par \par \uc2 Senators exempted automated clearinghouse transfers, so as not to impose a tax on international business, which Grooms warned would be catastrophic to the state's economy.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110310e73a00034\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 OMAHA, Neb. (AP) - This year's debate over illegal immigration was effectively halted in the Nebraska Legislature on Wednesday when a powerful committee voted not to advance any immigration bills.\par \par \uc2 Among the proposals tabled by the Judiciary Committee was a plan that would require police to confirm the residency status of suspected illegal immigrants. Instead of debating the bill, the committee authorized a study of Nebraska immigration issues.\par \par \uc2 The bill's sponsor, Fremont Sen. Charlie Janssen, said he considered the move a victory because the panel didn't outright kill the legislation.\par \par \uc2 "I feel like all the work I've put into this is starting to pay off," he said, adding that he plans to try again during the next legislative session to address illegal immigration in Nebraska.\par \par \uc2 A message left Wednesday for committee Chairman Sen. Brad Ashford of Omaha wasn't immediately returned.\par \par \uc2 Janssen's bill would require local law enforcement, when enforcing other laws, to question the immigration status of those they suspect are in the country illegally. It also would require non-U.S. citizens to carry documents showing their legal status. Failure to do so would be a misdemeanor.\par \par \uc2 The measure also criminalizes harboring, hiding or transporting an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . Violation of that would be a misdemeanor.\par \par \uc2 Janssen's measure was modeled after Arizona's controversial immigration law that was challenged by the U.S. Justice Department. Parts of the law were blocked by a federal judge in July, including provisions calling for police to check a person's immigration status while enforcing other laws and requiring immigrants to prove they were legally in the U.S.\par \par \uc2 Janssen's measure differed from the Arizona law in that it wouldn't allow law enforcement to make warrantless arrests of suspected illegal immigrants. That provision in Arizona's law has been blocked by the courts.\par \par \uc2 In an effort to prevent racial profiling, the Nebraska measure states that "a peace officer's reasonable suspicion shall not be based solely upon a person's race, color, religion, sex or national origin."\par \par \uc2 Janssen said Ashford told him the Judiciary Committee might be more open to something similar to legislation recently passed in Utah. Utah's measures including allowing illegal immigrants to get a permit to work in Utah, but also require police to check the immigration status of anyone stopped for a felony or serious misdemeanor.\par \par \uc2 Nebraska attracted national attention last year when voters in the city of Fremont approved a ban on hiring or renting to illegal immigrants. The decision was placed on hold pending lawsuits by the American Civil Liberties Union of Nebraska and the Mexican American Legal Defense & Educational Fund. Both cases are scheduled for trial in April 2012.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 The bill is LB48.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writer Margery Beck contributed to this report from Lincoln.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Online:\par \par \uc2 Nebraska Legislature: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.nebraskalegislature.gov"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.nebraskalegislature.gov}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110309e739002e6\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

(AP) - The South Dakota House has rejected a bill that sought to make it a state crime to hire an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The measure failed on a 33-35 vote after opponents said it is an unnecessary duplication of federal law.\par \par \uc2 Supporters argue that federal officials do not do enough to enforce immigration laws, so the state should step up its efforts to prevent the employment of illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 The measure passed the Senate earlier, but was rejected by a House committee. The full House then decided to revive the measure and debate it, but representatives decided Tuesday to kill the bill.\par \par \uc2 The measure would have imposed a civil fine for a first offense of knowingly employing an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . Subsequent offenses would result in harsher penalties.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110309e739000ey\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

House votes to change education budgeting\b0\par\par\uc2 By BOB JOHNSON   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 682 \uc2 words\par \uc2 8 March 2011\par 20:47\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2011.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) - Republicans in the Alabama Legislature got off to a fast start Tuesday as the House and Senate passed bills that were part of the promises the GOP made to voters last year and a House committee passed an Arizona-style immigration bill.\par \par \uc2 The House Public Safety and Homeland Security Committee approved the bill by Rep. Micky Hammon, R-Decatur, that would prohibit employers from knowingly hiring illegal immigrants and would require state and local officials to enforce federal immigration laws.\par \par \uc2 Hammon's bill also makes it a felony crime for an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  to register to vote. Hammon and other Republicans had been pushing for the legislation for several years, but they had trouble moving it before the GOP won control of the Legislature last year.\par \par \uc2 Republican House members completed one of the promises they made to voters last year in passing a bill that would change the way the Legislature prepares the education budget. It calls for using a system that bases the budget on tax revenue over the past 15 years rather than using estimates from legislative and state budget experts.\par \par \uc2 Canfield said basing the budgets on projections has caused governors to order cuts in the education budgets 20 times in the last 60 years. Democrats mostly opposed the bill, saying it would make it difficult to fund new education programs and pay raises for teachers and education workers.\par \par \uc2 The budgeting bill passed the House 67-33 with 65 Republicans and two Democrats voting for it. All 33 "no" votes were by Democrats.\par \par \uc2 "The adoption of this bill proves the Legislature is interested in teachers and that we want to break the cycle of proration," Canfield said, referring to the process governors use to order budget cuts. He said the cycle of past budget cuts has made it difficult for education officials to plan for new programs or teacher pay raises. But Democrats argued that the new system would not work.\par \par \uc2 "Something ought to be in the legislation that would tell us how it's going to compensate teachers," said Rep. James Buskey, D-Mobile.\par \par \uc2 In the Senate Tuesday, the chamber's Republican majority pushed through legislation on a 23-12 vote to end deferred retirement benefits for state employees and school workers.\par \par \uc2 The Senate bill, which still must pass the House, would end the Deferred Retirement Option Program. The program allows public employees who are at least 55 years old and have 25 years of service to continue their state jobs while putting their retirement benefits into a special interest-bearing account for up to five years.\par \par \uc2 The sponsor of the bill, Sen. Del Marsh, R-Anniston, said the state can no longer afford DROP. He said Gov. Robert Bentley's proposed budgets for fiscal 2012 won't balance unless DROP is ended.\par \par \uc2 "The reality is we've got a budget deficit," Marsh said.\par \par \uc2 Sen. Hank Sanders, D-Selma, sponsored the DROP legislation when it was adopted in 1990. He said before DROP was approved good teachers would work for 25 years in Alabama and then go to neighboring states to start second careers in education.\par \par \uc2 The immigration bill, which would prevent illegal immigrants from receiving many public benefits, was approved in committee despite the concerns of the head of the Alabama Coalition Against Domestic Violence, Carol Gundlach. She fears the bill would make criminals of operators of domestic violence shelters who take in abused women and children who are illegal immigrants. Hammon says the bill would be amended to make an exception for the shelters.\par \par \uc2 Hammon said the bill requires employers to use a federal system called "e-verify" to determine if new workers are legal. He said the legislation will take the burden of making that decision off of employers.\par \par \uc2 Rep. Kerry Rich, R-Albertville, who represents an area of north Alabama popular with immigrants mostly from Mexico, said the legislation is badly needed.\par \par \uc2 "We need strong legislation that will prohibit illegal immigrants from driving without licenses or insurance," Rich said.\par \par \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110309e73900017\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

She needs to recognize what's happening in this nation."\par \par \uc2 Washington state is one of two states in the country that still let illegal immigrants obtain driver's licenses. New Mexico is the other state that still allows such practice, but lawmakers there are also considering bills to close the access.\par \par \uc2 Gov. Chris Gregoire has said that if the Legislature passed a bill dealing with driver's licenses, she would sign it.\par \par \uc2 The bill would have required applicants for driver's license to provide proof of residency and a social security number. Supporters had said the bill aimed to stop identification fraud. Haugen said that there are 300,000 more driver's licenses in this state than there are drivers.\par \par \uc2 Opponents, though, had said that it would have led the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  community to drive without licenses and car insurance. They also have said that the estimated cost of the bill -- about $1.5 million in the next two-year budget -- is too expensive in a year that the state faces a deficit.\par \par \uc2 After Monday's defeat, the bill appears dead. No other licenses bill received a vote on the House.\par \par \uc2 Monday's vote was the furthest a bill dealing with the driver's license issue has ever gotten in the Legislature.\par \par \uc2 Haugen, who is the chairwoman of the Senate transportation committee, said that for years she had stopped similar bills because she was worried about the impact on the farm industry, which has a significant number of illegal immigrants working using fake identification.\par \par \uc2 The Senator argued that her bill would have put restrictions on identification fraud by imposing stricter rules on state residency, adding that illegal immigrants currently in the state would have not been affected by the proposed law.\par \par \uc2 She said that she's concerned that if lawmakers don't act, an initiative will be approved in this state with stricter rules affecting farm workers. But attempts at such initiatives have failed in the last half a decade in the state, with organizers failing to get the signatures needed.\par \par \uc2 An attempt to ask Democratic Senate Floor Leader Sen. Tracey Eide why leadership did not support the bill, an aide said she had no time for questions. Through spokesman Jeff Reading, other Senate leadership also declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 Republican Sen. Curtis King, R-Yakima, said he was disappointed that the bill didn't get a vote, adding that he worries the state will attract more identification fraud.\par \par \uc2 "We're probably going to be the only state in the union without restrictions," King said.\par \par \uc2 Late last year, the Department of Licensing tightened rules around obtaining a license, requiring people who can't provide social securities to prove that they have state residency.\par \par \uc2 Craig Keller, organizer for Respect WA, the group that has pushed for initiatives with stricter immigration rules said that it was a shame that the bill didn't get a full vote.\par \par \uc2 "It was a start to bring some sanity to the driver's license issue," Keller said.\par \par \uc2 But Pramila Jayapal, executive director of OneAmerica, whose organization lobbied against the bill, said that state lawmakers are trying to fill the void left by the federal government's lack of action on immigration law, but that restricting driver's licenses does not address immigration issues.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110308e73800061\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHOENIX (AP) - The number of inmates suspected of being illegal immigrants in Arizona's most populous county has dropped by nearly 40 percent, despite an increase in deportations across the country over the same two-year time frame.\par \par \uc2 Just under 10,000 suspected illegal immigrants were housed in Maricopa County jails in 2010, compared with more than 16,000 in 2008.\par \par \uc2 One explanation for the decrease is that fewer people in general are committing crimes that land them in Maricopa County jail. The average number of inmates in county custody fell by 13 percent during the same time period as the 40 percent drop in immigration holds.\par \par \uc2 Also, the number of immigrants living in Arizona without authorization has decreased, meaning police encounter fewer "criminal aliens," or illegal immigrants who have committed serious crimes that would land them in county jail.\par \par \uc2 And even as local police encounter fewer illegal immigrants, federal officials have stepped up immigration-law-enforcement efforts through a variety of programs that can lead to the deportation of illegal immigrants who have not committed serious crimes after crossing the border.\par \par \uc2 Rising deportation figures include all immigrants removed from Arizona by federal agents, a population that includes immigrants from other states who are housed in one of the detention centers U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement operates or leases in Arizona.\par \par \uc2 "ICE is filling just as many detention beds in Arizona as they were three years ago," said Kara Hartzler of the Florence Immigrant and Refugee Rights Project.\par \par \uc2 There are many illegal immigrants in custody from out of state, mostly from California, she said.\par \par \uc2 Explanations for the decline in immigrants in Maricopa County jails generally break along political lines.\par \par \uc2 Immigration-enforcement advocates credit Arizona's track record of controversial legislation, including Senate Bill 1070, and vocal lawmen such as Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio for creating an atmosphere that discourages illegal immigrants from staying in Maricopa County.\par \par \uc2 "It seems like a local government's policies and its positions can cause a real drop in the illegal-immigration population," said Steven Camarota, director of research with the Center for Immigration Studies, a research institute that supports strict immigration enforcement. "With all those caveats of `It's an imperfect measure,' it does seem that the decline in Arizona was much more manifest than elsewhere."\par \par \uc2 But immigrant-rights advocates and others point to the economy as a key factor driving illegal immigrants out of Arizona, just as the recession led to a decline in illegal immigrants across the nation.\par \par \uc2 Many also believe newer ICE programs play a role. For instance, the agency's Secure Communities program shares information with the federal government on every suspect who is fingerprinted by a law-enforcement agency in Arizona, which could contribute to an overall increase in deportations from the state. These immigrants are caught by ICE before they are ever booked into county jail on state charges.\par \par \uc2 More than half of immigrants ICE has deported from Maricopa County through the Secure Communities program either did not commit any serious offenses or did not commit a criminal offense at all, according to the agency's data.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Information from: The
