The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHOENIX (AP) - A claim by Arizona's governor that rising violence along the U.S.-Mexico border has led to headless bodies turning up in the desert came back to haunt her during a stammering debate performance in which she failed to back it up.\par \par \uc2 Gov. Jan Brewer, who gained national attention defending the state's tough new immigration law and warning of increasing border bloodshed, has spent the time since the gubernatorial candidates' debate earlier this week trying to repair the damage done from her cringe-worthy contest against underdog challenger Terry Goddard.\par \par \uc2 "That was an error, if I said that," the Republican told The Associated Press on Friday. "I misspoke, but you know, let me be clear, I am concerned about the border region because it continues to be reported in Mexico that there's a lot of violence going on and we don't want that going into Arizona."\par \par \uc2 She said she was referring to beheadings and other cartel-related violence in Mexico in comments she made earlier this summer about decapitated bodies found in the state's southern region.\par \par \uc2 Brewer's candidacy caught a big break in April, when she signed a controversial new state immigration law that put local police officers on the front lines of enforcing federal immigration law. At the time, Brewer's primary campaign faced serious challenges, but signing the bill cleared her path to what proved to be an easy primary win on Aug. 24.\par \par \uc2 Brewer stumbled through her opening statement of the debate Wednesday. She lost her train of thought for more than 10 painful seconds as she laughed, looked down at the table and finally regained her composure.\par \par \uc2 Goddard, who trailed by 20 points in a July poll, said he brought up the beheadings comments because Brewer hadn't acknowledged she was wrong.\par \par \uc2 "It's a kind of fear-mongering that has hurt our economy. It has driven jobs away," he said. "She wouldn't come off it."\par \par \uc2 Brewer apparently first referred to beheadings during a June 16 interview with Fox News, talking about "the kidnappings and the extortion and the beheadings and the fact that people can't feel safe in their community" in discussing controversy surrounding the immigration law.\par \par \uc2 She went further in a June 27 interview on Phoenix television station KPNX when asked about the earlier beheadings claim.\par \par \uc2 "Oh, our law enforcement agencies have found bodies in the desert, either buried or just lying out there, that have been beheaded," Brewer said.\par \par \uc2 A veteran Arizona political observer said her latest gaffes may not sway many voters but could put a charge into Goddard's campaign.\par \par \uc2 "I think it gave him an opening," said Bruce Merrill, a longtime pollster and retired Arizona State University journalism professor.\par \par \uc2 Goddard can now play the debate clips over and over as he attacks her competence to lead Arizona.\par \par \uc2 In fact, there have been beheadings in Mexico in violence associated with criminal cartels that include those active in cross-border smuggling.\par \par \uc2 And some violence has spilled over the border, including the March slaying of a southern Arizona rancher, Robert Krentz. Law enforcement officials have said they believe Krentz was killed by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , likely a scout for drug smugglers.\par \par \uc2 But none of the southern Arizona coroners who handle immigrant cases have seen headless bodies.\par \par \uc2 Pima County's Dr. Eric Peters said some people might be confused when just skulls are sometimes found in the desert, but that's because of decomposition and animals that feed off bodies. He said it'd be clear if any one of those skulls had been severed from a body.\par \par \uc2 "You would find what we would call tool marks because you need to use some sort of tool to forcibly remove someone's head from the spine," he said. "You'd see saw marks," even on skulls that have long been in the desert.\par \par \uc2 A Republican legislator who was the prime sponsor of Arizona's immigration law said Brewer's critics were just playing games and ignoring the real issue -- violence bleeding across the border into the United States.\par \par \uc2 "I can tell you there's been 300 to 500 beheadings and dismemberments along that border," state Sen. Russell Pearce said Thursday. "It is a national security concern, yet we're worried about this game-playing, this word-smithing."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100904e694000vm\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHOENIX (AP) - Gov. Jan Brewer rose to national fame defending the state's immigration law and warning of rising violence along the U.S.-Mexico border, including a claim that headless bodies were turning up in the Arizona desert.\par \par \uc2 But the claim has come back to haunt her after her stammering debate performance in which she failed to back it up and ignored repeated questions on the issue from a scrum of reporters.\par \par \uc2 Brewer has spent the time since backtracking and trying to repair the damage done from her cringe-worthy debate against underdog challenger Terry Goddard.\par \par \uc2 "That was an error, if I said that," the Republican told The Associated Press on Friday. "I misspoke, but you know, let me be clear, I am concerned about the border region because it continues to be reported in Mexico that there's a lot of violence going on and we don't want that going into Arizona."\par \par \uc2 She said she was referring to beheadings and other cartel-related violence in Mexico in comments she made earlier this summer about decapitated bodies found in the state's southern region.\par \par \uc2 Brewer's candidacy caught a big break in April, when she signed a controversial new state immigration law that put local police officers on the front lines of enforcing federal immigration law. At the time, Brewer's primary campaign faced serious challenges, but signing the bill cleared her path to what proved to be an easy primary win on Aug. 24.\par \par \uc2 A veteran Arizona political observer said her latest gaffes may not sway many voters but could put a charge into Goddard's campaign.\par \par \uc2 "I think it gave him an opening," said Bruce Merrill, a longtime pollster and retired Arizona State University journalism professor.\par \par \uc2 Goddard can now play the debate clips over and over as he attacks her competence to lead Arizona.\par \par \uc2 Brewer stumbled through her opening statement of the debate Wednesday. She lost her train of thought for more than 10 painful seconds as she laughed, looked down at the table and finally regained her composure.\par \par \uc2 Goddard, who trailed by 20 points in a July poll, said he brought up the beheadings comments because Brewer hadn't acknowledged she was wrong.\par \par \uc2 "It's a kind of fear-mongering that has hurt our economy. It has driven jobs away," he said. "She wouldn't come off it."\par \par \uc2 Brewer apparently first referred to beheadings during a June 16 interview with Fox News, talking about "the kidnappings and the extortion and the beheadings and the fact that people can't feel safe in their community" in discussing controversy surrounding the immigration law.\par \par \uc2 She went further in a June 27 interview on Phoenix television station KPNX when asked about the earlier beheadings claim.\par \par \uc2 "Oh, our law enforcement agencies have found bodies in the desert, either buried or just lying out there, that have been beheaded," Brewer said.\par \par \uc2 In fact, there have been beheadings in Mexico in violence associated with criminal cartels that include those active in cross-border smuggling.\par \par \uc2 And some violence has spilled over the border, including the March slaying of a southern Arizona rancher, Robert Krentz. Law enforcement officials have said they believe Krentz was killed by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , likely a scout for drug smugglers.\par \par \uc2 But none of the southern Arizona coroners who handle immigrant cases have seen headless bodies.\par \par \uc2 Pima County's Dr. Eric Peters said some people might be confused when just skulls are sometimes found in the desert, but that's because of decomposition and animals that feed off bodies. He said it'd be clear if any one of those skulls had been severed from a body.\par \par \uc2 "You would find what we would call tool marks because you need to use some sort of tool to forcibly remove someone's head from the spine," he said. "You'd see saw marks," even on skulls that have long been in the desert.\par \par \uc2 It's not the first time the Republican governor, who became governor when Democrat Janet Napolitano resigned to became secretary of U.S. Homeland Security, has drawn criticism for exaggerated remarks. In June, she said most illegal immigrants entering Arizona are being used to transport drugs across the border, an assertion panned by most people who study immigration.\par \par \uc2 A Republican legislator who was the prime sponsor of Arizona's immigration law said Brewer's critics were just playing games and ignoring the real issue -- violence bleeding across the border into the United States.\par \par \uc2 "I can tell you there's been 300 to 500 beheadings and dismemberments along that border," state Sen. Russell Pearce said Thursday. "It is a national security concern, yet we're worried about this game-playing, this word-smithing."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100903e693001s4\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc3}{\*\bkmkend toc3}\b \uc2 Most illegal immigrants who give birth in US have lived here at least 5 years\b0\par\par\uc2 By BOB CHRISTIE and PAUL J. WEBER   \par \uc2 Associated Press Writers\par \uc2 1,037 \uc2 words\par \uc2 3 September 2010\par 17:53\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2010.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SAN JUAN, Texas (AP) - When Ruth Garcia's twins are born in two months, they'll have all the rights of U.S. citizens. They and their six brothers and sisters will be able to vote, apply for federal student loans and even run for president.\par \par \uc2 Garcia is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who crossed into the country about 14 years ago, before her children were born, and the citizenship granted to her children and millions others like them is at the center of a divisive national debate.\par \par \uc2 Republicans are pushing for congressional hearings to consider changing the nation's 14th Amendment to deny such children the automatic citizenship the Constitution guarantees. They say women like Garcia are taking advantage of the constitutional amendment and paint a picture of pregnant women rushing across the border to give birth.\par \par \uc2 While a recent Pew Hispanic Center study shows 8 percent of the 4.3 million babies born in the U.S. in 2008 had at least one illegal parent, a closer examination shows that most children of illegal immigrants are born to parents like Garcia who have made the United States their home for years.\par \par \uc2 Out of 340,000 babies born to illegal immigrants in the United States in 2008, 85 percent of the parents had been in the country for more than a year, and more than half for at least five years, Jeffrey Passel, a senior demographer for Pew, told The Associated Press.\par \par \uc2 And immigration experts say it's extraordinarily rare for immigrants to come to the U.S. just so they can have babies and get citizenship. In most cases, they come for economic reasons and better hospitals, and end up staying and raising families.\par \par \uc2 Garcia's husband has been deported and she earns a living selling tamales to other immigrants who live in fear of being deported from the slapdash, impoverished colonias that dot the Texas-Mexico border.\par \par \uc2 "I think that children aren't at fault for having been born here," Garcia said. "My children always have lived here. They've never gone to another country."\par \par \uc2 Under current immigration law, Garcia and others like her don't get U.S. citizenship even though their children are Americans.\par \par \uc2 With an estimated 11.1 million illegal immigrants living in the United States, the issue strikes a chord with many voters -- people like retired Air Force nurse and pediatric nurse practitioner Susan Struck, 66, of Double \uc2 Adobe\uc2 , Ariz.\par \par \uc2 "People come over ... and they have babies with U.S. birth certificates, then they go back over the border with that Social Security number, with that birth certificate," and have access to public services, she said at a recent event near the border organized by conservative tea party activists.\par \par \uc2 Several prominent Republican leaders share Struck's beliefs on the issue. Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina has been a vocal advocate for changing the Constitution, and he helped the issue gain momentum heading into the midterm elections.\par \par \uc2 "Women have traveled from across the world for the purpose of adding a U.S. passport holder to their family, as far away as China, Turkey and as close as Mexico," said Jon Feere, legal analyst for the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for strict immigration laws.\par \par \uc2 Still, changing the Constitution is highly unlikely, legal scholars say. Measures have been introduced in each two-year congressional session since 2005, but none has made it out of committee. Constitutional changes require approval by two-thirds majorities in both chambers of Congress, an impossibility now because Democrats have the majority in both houses and most oppose such a measure. Even if Republicans gain power in November and legislation is passed, an amendment would still need to be ratified by three-fourths of the states.\par \par \uc2 To be sure, some pregnant Mexican women do come to the United States. In border cities like Nogales, women have been coming to the U.S. for decades to give birth, although the primary reason is better medical care, Santa Cruz County sheriff Tony Estrada said. Billboards advertising birthing services in Arizona line streets across the border in Nogales, Mexico.\par \par \uc2 Tucson Medical Center, 115 miles southeast of Phoenix, offers packages designed to provide inclusive care to new mothers. The program draws some residents of the northern Mexican state of Sonora who can afford its upfront costs and already have U.S. visas, spokesman Michael Letson said.\par \par \uc2 Princeton University demographer Douglas Massey said in 30 years studying Mexican immigration, he's never interviewed a migrant who said they came to the United States just to get citizenship for their children.\par \par \uc2 "Mexicans do not come to have babies in the United States," said Massey, who blames the tightening of the border in the 1990s for cutting off normal migration of men who used to come to work for a year or two and then go home. "They end up having babies in the United States because men can no longer circulate freely back and forth from homes in Mexico to jobs in the United States and husbands and wives quite understandably want to be together."\par \par \uc2 More common, he and other experts says, are families stuck with one child who is legal and others who aren't -- like Beatriz Gomez, a 35-year-old \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who came to Phoenix 11 years ago on a now-expired tourist visa from Arriaga in the Mexican state of Chiapas.\par \par \uc2 Her 12-year-old daughter was born in Mexico and is here illegally, but her two youngest children, ages 8 and 5, were born in the U.S. and are citizens.\par \par \uc2 "It's sad," Gomez said of her oldest daughter, who was only 1 when the family came to the United States and won't qualify for benefits such as in-state college tuition rates or federal student loans. "She studies hard, and she won't be able to go to a university like the other two."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Christie reported from El Mirage, Ariz.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.    \par \par \uc2 PHOENIX (AP) - Oscar Vazquez knew he was taking a risk when he returned to Mexico for the first time in his adult life, starting what could have been a years-long odyssey to earn legal U.S. residency.\par \par \uc2 Turned out the wait was just 361 days, thanks to some political intervention. Vazquez was back in the U.S. Monday, visa in hand.\par \par \uc2 "Even though it took a year, I feel it came out good," Vazquez said Monday.\par \par \uc2 ASU grad returns to Mexico to do the right thing\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , a recent Arizona State University graduate, knew he would need to obtain the necessary documents if he ever wanted to put his hard-earned engineering degree to work.\par \par \uc2 Last year he essentially deported himself, leaving behind his wife and infant daughter to do what he said was the right thing -- obtain legal residency.\par \par \uc2 And as he settled into Mexico after filing all the paperwork, he feared the wait could stretch on for years. But the timely intervention of a U.S. Senator played a key role in Vazquez's return.\par \par \uc2 Vazquez, who received international media attention as a high school student when his robotics team won a collegiate competition, had another splash of publicity with his struggle to reverse his illegal status. His story was told in the The Arizona Republic, on CNN and on the floor of the U.S. Senate.\par \par \uc2 When Vazquez graduated from Arizona State University in 2009, he was one of the featured graduates whose tale was told in front of the stadium, where attendees included commencement speaker President Barack Obama.\par \par \uc2 But Vazquez knew his legal status would prevent him from using his degree. So, he decided to turn himself in at the consulate in Juarez, Mexico, admit his illegal presence, and apply for permission to re-enter.\par \par \uc2 The government initially denied Vazquez's request and asked for additional paperwork, documenting the hardship to his wife and daughter, both U.S. citizens.\par \par \uc2 Officials told him to expect a final answer in March. Meanwhile, Vazquez was living in Magdalena del Kino, a dusty town in Sonora, Mexico, working a night shift at an automobile parts factory.\par \par \uc2 Vazquez said he was contacted by the office of Sen. Dick Dubin, D-Illinois. Durbin, the Senate Majority Whip, is a proponent of the Dream Act, legislation that would grant legal status to illegal immigrants who entered as children and had attended college or joined the military.\par \par \uc2 Vazquez said he once Durbin was involved, "it was fast."\par \par \uc2 A Durbin aide, who would only speak about the case on the condition his name wasn't used, said the office did make the Department of Homeland Security aware of the case.\par \par \uc2 Vazquez's story was told in the Republic on July 4. On July 14, his wife, Karla Vazquez, received the letter saying her husband's visa waiver had been approved.\par \par \uc2 Karla Vazquez, who had been taking regular trips to Mexico, to visit with her husband was about to head down for another trip when she decided to check the mail and saw the letter from the government.\par \par \uc2 "It just said, your waiver was approved," Karla Vazquez said.\par \par \uc2 She didn't tell Oscar the news until she drove down to Magdalena and saw him in person.\par \par \uc2 "We were just looking at it," Oscar said, "just to make sure it was true."\par \par \uc2 Oscar Vazquez had his appointment at the U.S. Consulate on Thursday. He received a packet of paperwork on Friday that allowed him to cross back into the United States.\par \par \uc2 It was a much different entrance than his first one, at age 12. He and his mother dashed across the border near Douglas into a car waiting at a \uc2 Wal-Mart\uc2  parking lot.\par \par \uc2 This entry was short on ceremony. Vazquez, 24, said a nearly emotionless-clerk told him that with his visa he was allowed to live and work in the United States.\par \par \uc2 Vazquez walked out onto American soil and waited to catch a bus into Phoenix. Before then, he had a meal of KFC.\par \par \uc2 His wife met him at the bus station. "It's just hard to describe," Oscar Vazquez said, about seeing his wife and daughter. "It's amazing just to be back home."\par \par \uc2 Vazquez said he realized his was a unique case and that he was aided by political pressure. Had it not been for the publicity and a politician's intervention, he thinks he would have been denied.\par \par \uc2 "A lot of people think that: 'Why don't you do it the right way?'" he said. "But many people can't."\par \par \uc2 Had Vazquez been denied his waiver, he would have been barred from entering the United States for 10 years. He and his wife had discussed plans of moving to Mexico City, Canada or Europe.\par \par \uc2 Vazquez expects to receive his Social Security card in about two weeks and will start looking for work in the engineering field.\par \par \uc2 Vazquez was on the Carl Hayden High School team that beat out several colleges, including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in an underwater robotics competition. The triumph of the four undocumented high school students was featured in Wired magazine. Other national media outlets picked up the story. Movie offers followed.\par \par \uc2 On Monday, Vazquez showed up at Carl Hayden High School to talk with his robotics coach, Faridodin Lajvardi. Two other members of that four-person team also showed up, making for an impromptu reunion of that victorious team from 2007.\par \par \uc2 Lajvardi gathered his current Carl Hayden students around him in the hallway and introduced Vazquez. His students had seen video of Durbin telling Vazquez's story on the Senate floor.\par \par \uc2 "All that time, I kept telling you how you need to fight, fight, fight," he told the students. "It worked."\par \par \uc2 The team gave Vazquez a group hug.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100901e691000v3\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 LOS ANGELES (AP) - Civil rights lawyers filed a federal lawsuit Tuesday against a government contractor that was the target of an immigration raid this summer, accusing the company of bilking illegal workers out of pay and violating their rights.\par \par \uc2 The suit accuses \uc2 Terra Universal Inc\uc2 . and its owner, George Sadaghiani, of denying \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  workers overtime and sick pay and discriminating against them because of their visa status.\par \par \uc2 "Our employment laws provide everyone equal workplace rights regardless of what country you came from, how you got here and your immigration status," said Jennie Pasquarella, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union-Southern California, which is participating in the suit. "A fair day's pay for a fair day's work is a basic American rule, with no exceptions."\par \par \uc2 Immigration agents seized 43 workers in June at Terra Universal's Fullerton factory, where lawyers say the company manufactures laboratory equipment for the U.S. military and other government clients.\par \par \uc2 The lawsuit names four workers, two of whom were seized in the raid. Pasquarella said lawyers would seek class-action status for the suit, which seeks lost wages and other damages for what could eventually include some 300 plaintiffs.\par \par \uc2 The suit alleges that the company put red stickers on \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  workers' personnel files, which marked them for lower pay, longer hours and hostile treatment.\par \par \uc2 It also accuses the company of forcing illegal workers to clock out at the end of their eight-hour work days, then clock back in as a "second job" in order to evade scrutiny of its overtime payments.\par \par \uc2 "The abuse and exploitation are not part of the laws of this country," Carlos Lameli, a former Terra Universal worker, said in Spanish through an interpreter. "The only thing we want is to be recognized for our rights as workers. We want a dignified and fair treatment of our work."\par \par \uc2 Terra Universal Chief Operating Officer Ken Harms said the company values its employees and is sad to hear some may be dissatisfied.\par \par \uc2 The company is also being investigated by the U.S. Department of Labor, Pasquarella said. A Labor Department spokesman did not return a call.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100831e68v0029d\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ATLANTA (AP) - Thirty-eight indigent patients whose dialysis treatment was set to end Tuesday would continue receiving the service under an agreement a hospital is negotiating with several clinics.\par \par \uc2 The Atlanta-area patients -- many of them illegal immigrants -- received dialysis at Grady Memorial Hospital until the Atlanta safety net facility closed its outpatient dialysis clinic in October for financial reasons. The hospital had continued to pay for treatment at private clinics, but that contract was set to expire Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 "We have the framework of an agreement," Grady spokesman Matt Gove said Tuesday. "It's a community issue and the major dialysis providers in the community have stepped up and said they will provide some charity care."\par \par \uc2 The hospital is working with DeKalb County Commissioner Larry Johnson, Emory Healthcare, \uc2 Fresenius Medical Care\uc2  and \uc2 DaVita\uc2  on an agreement. Some critical details, including Grady's portion of the cost and the length of the commitment, are still being worked out, Gove said.\par \par \uc2 "We are in active negotiations and believe this is positive and productive, a good step in the right direction," said Fresenius spokeswoman Rosemary Heinold.\par \par \uc2 "We continue to work constructively with community leaders to develop a solution while the parties involved resolve this issue," \uc2 DaVita\uc2  spokesman Vince Hancock said in an e-mail.\par \par \uc2 Emory Healthcare has accepted three of the patients and will begin treating them in September at a cost of roughly $40,000 per patient per year, the hospital system said in a statement.\par \par \uc2 Bineet Kaur, a 27-year-old Indian native and Grady patient, was overjoyed Tuesday to hear that an agreement was in the works.\par \par \uc2 "The last two weeks have been so stressful, I've been having pains from stress because I didn't know what I would do," she said. "I'm so relieved to hear there's going to be an agreement. Thank you to God."\par \par \uc2 Kaur came to the U.S. on a tourist visa in 2000 and applied for political asylum, saying she didn't feel safe in India as a single woman living alone. Her asylum request was denied, making her an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . She was diagnosed with kidney failure in 2003 and has been doing better since she began treatment at in 2009, but she still relies on an aunt to help care for her.\par \par \uc2 She is one of 33 patients who sued Grady, claiming the hospital is abandoning them. A judge threw out the case in December, but it's set to be heard in state appeals court this fall, said Lindsay Jones, a lawyer for the patients.\par \par \uc2 Since no formal agreement has been signed, the litigation remains in effect, said Dorothy Leone-Glasser, a patient advocate who has been helping the Grady patients.\par \par \uc2 State Sen. Vincent Fort, whose district includes Atlanta, said he planned to hold a candlelight vigil Tuesday evening outside Grady, "in memory of those who have passed, and for the future fatalities that will occur due to the closure of the clinic."\par \par \uc2 Past agreements have led to temporary fixes, he said, and he planned to go ahead with the vigil and a visit to the Fulton County Commission.\par \par \uc2 "We're going to move forward until we are confident those patients are going to continue to receive treatment," he said.\par \par \uc2 Patients who need dialysis cannot survive long without it. If their care were discontinued, advocates have said, many of the patients would likely end up in emergency rooms, where they would only be treated once their condition was life-threatening.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100831e68v00234\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

Paul Edwards says 25-year-old Renee Harris of Alton told police that an oncoming car veered into her lane about 9 a.m. Sunday. She swerved and crash into the custom-made black iron fence.

In 1991, a man broke in while King's wife was home alone. She ran to a neighbor's house and called police.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 NEW YORK (AP) - Don't underestimate her just because she's a little girl. "Dora The Explorer" is a multibillion-dollar franchise that may be creating a more enlightened generation, more open to different people and cultures not their own.\par \par \uc2 Ten years have passed since the Latina Dora became the first bilingual heroine of children's TV and conquered the hearts of kids around the world. Nickelodeon has celebrated the anniversary with a one-hour special that features the voices of Rosie Perez, John Leguizamo and Hector Elizondo, and a documentary with comments from Dora herself, the series' creators, experts from the industry, real-life kids and celebrities such as Salma Hayek and Shakira.\par \par \uc2 "I think that the fact that kids are identifying with a kid with darker color skin that speaks another language (shows they are more open)," said Chris Gifford, one of the show's creators and executive producers. "Kids want their parents to read them the books and watch Dora with them. ... That's what it's about."\par \par \uc2 "Dora The Explorer" is seen today in 151 markets and is translated to 30 languages. In English-speaking countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Ireland, Dora teaches Spanish; in other markets -- including the Hispanic U.S. markets -- the adventurous little girl teaches English.\par \par \uc2 According to Nickelodeon, "Dora" has generated over $11 billion in worldwide sales since 2002, having sold 65 million units of Fisher Price Dora the Explorer toys, 50 million books and over 20 million DVDs worldwide. In France, publishing house \uc2 Albin Michel\uc2  has sold more than 12 million educational Dora books since its launch -- or one Dora book for every child in France, the network points out.\par \par \uc2 Yet, the original idea for the show had nothing to do with a bilingual girl.\par \par \uc2 "She didn't start as a Latina or a heroine -- she was a forest animal," said co-creator and executive producer Valerie Walsh Valdes. "Nickelodeon actually asked us to consider making her a Latina because a recent study said that there were no positive bilingual characters on children's television."\par \par \uc2 So producers turned to such experts as historian Carlos E. Cortes, author of "The Children Are Watching" and "The Making -- and Remaking -- of a Multiculturalist."\par \par \uc2 "He was absolutely instrumental in helping us find the best way to put Dora forward in terms of culture," said Gifford. Cortes advised that Dora should always be inclusive, so producers decided not to give her a particular country of origin.\par \par \uc2 "I am delighted with the way 'Dora' has come out, particularly the impact it seems to be having in young people," said Cortes, professor emeritus of history at the University of California, Riverside. "The Latino kids take pride having Dora as a lead character and non-Latino kids can embrace someone different."\par \par \uc2 "I think that Dora has a very specific special relationship with kids at home, not necessarily for being bilingual but as a powerful character who invites kids on adventures," says Brown Johnson, president, Animation, Nickelodeon and MTVN Kids and Family Group. "Here, Spanish words open doors."\par \par \uc2 In "Dora The Explorer," the Latin flavor is present not only in the language and Dora's features but also in characters such as Isa the Iguana and Tico the Squirrel, scenes, themes and family values. The little star invites her young, preschool viewers to come with her on an adventure, where she usually faces a problem that she cannot resolve by herself.\par \par \uc2 Dora asks her audience to answer questions in an interactive show that includes silences that are long enough for viewers to suggest an answer.\par \par \uc2 "The kids are feeling good about putting together the puzzle bridge (that will solve the problem). ... Dora needs THEIR help!" says Walsh Valdes.\par \par \uc2 Each episode relies on the advice of educators and cultural experts, and can take more than a year to produce, in part because not one gets into the air without first being screened in front of the most honest and feared jury: at least 75 children. "Just the heartbreak to see those kids disappointed! We really take it personally. ... These 3 year olds," Gifford said. They really listen to the children, said Walsh Valdes.\par \par \uc2 Dora's voice has been portrayed the last three years by Caitlin Sanchez. The 14-year-old succeeded the original voice of Dora, Kathleen Herles, when she left to go to college.\par \par \uc2 "It's really an honor to play an icon," said Sanchez, who enjoys making the voice of the Latina idol in front of her little fans, who immediately recognize it: "It's Dora!" "She's got Dora inside her mouth!"\par \par \uc2 "Dora is like the most helping person in the world," the young actress said. "I have learned a lot from her, too. ... She's a great role model."\par \par \uc2 Stars such as Angelina Jolie and Salma Hayek have spoken about the relationship of Dora with their families.\par \par \uc2 "There's a 'Dora The Explorer' (episode) where Dora's mom has twins -- a boy and a girl," Jolie told People magazine in 2008, noting how her older children got ready for the arrival of her own twins. "They watched that a lot."\par \par \uc2 "I love Dora! She's been such a part of my relationship with my child," said Hayek at the show's 10th anniversary press conference in March. "I love that it's bilingual and that she's a heroine who has Latin roots."\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, a Dora balloon made its debut in \uc2 Macy's\uc2  2005 Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York, the first time for a Latino character.\par \par \uc2 "It's flattering, but it also speaks about how Dora has transcended from just being a preschool show. There's something really amazing in her ability to cross over," said Walsh Valdes.\par \par \uc2 "Dora" has aired against the backdrop of the immigration debate. When the new Arizona law was announced, a photo of Dora behind bars as a suspected \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  made the rounds on the Internet.\par \par \uc2 Such is the influence of Dora, Cortes said, that future fans could affect the political future of America. A 5-year-old viewer in 2000 is now 15.\par \par \uc2 "It will be another three years until they go to college and be able to vote, and I think we may see a difference. You can't be certain, but our hope is that young people of all backgrounds will be more open," he said. "If Dora can do that, her impact is unimaginable."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Online:\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.nickjr.com/dora-the-explorer/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.nickjr.com/dora-the-explorer/}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100827e68r001p5\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ATLANTA (AP) - Authorities in Michigan's Genesee County were jubilant when Atlanta police arrested a suspect in a spate of serial stabbings that left five people dead. They weren't so thrilled about picking up the tab to get him back.\par \par \uc2 Extradition has long been a sore spot for sheriffs who contend state and federal authorities should pay more of the costs to return fugitives. Now economic troubles and budget deficits are forcing prosecutors and sheriffs to make tough decisions about who will face prosecution and who will remain free.\par \par \uc2 Returning the stabbing suspect, Elias Abuelazam, to Michigan to face multiple murder charges is expected to cost between $2,000 and $10,000 at a time when Genessee County has an $18 million budget deficit.\par \par \uc2 "We have to juggle with limited resources," said Genesee County Prosecutor David Leyton. "I have to do more with less, but so does just about everybody. We will do the job whether we get the extra help or not."\par \par \uc2 Officials said there was no question it was worth the cost in the case of Abuelazam, who is suspected in a string of 18 attacks in Michigan, Ohio and Virginia. He is expected to be extradited this week after his Aug. 11 arrest at Atlanta's airport.\par \par \uc2 But some authorities are now weighing the costs of extradition with the severity of the crime. Some lower-level offenders and suspects may not be extradited -- which means they're set free.\par \par \uc2 John Morganelli, the district attorney of Pennsylvania's Northampton County, said detectives were once dispatched as far as California to pick up suspects in relatively minor crimes. He still extradites suspects in violent crimes, but he has drawn the line at lower-level misdemeanors such as probation violation or failure to pay fines.\par \par \uc2 "It doesn't make sense to spend more tax dollars to collect tax dollars that are owed," he said. "If it's a misdemeanor charge, a case where no great public harm is involved, we just can't go."\par \par \uc2 The risk is undermining the justice system when the resources don't exist to pursue all criminal offenders.\par \par \uc2 "County sheriffs are suffering immensely with extradition costs. And this isn't something to be taken lightly," said Aaron Kennard, the executive director of the National Sheriffs' Association. "If we don't extradite them, they never pay for the crime. If we don't go get them, we're thumbing our nose at the judicial system."\par \par \uc2 It's hard to quantify how many state or county prisoners are extradited each year from one jurisdiction to another. Federal authorities and the sheriffs association do not track the data, and several departments only ventured a rough guess. But Kennard said even small sheriffs' offices could extradite hundreds of people each year, while larger jurisdictions often ship thousands.\par \par \uc2 Each journey can be costly. Sheriff's offices or prosecutors often send two or three deputies or detectives to pick up suspects. With airfare, lodging and board, shipping a suspect hundreds of miles can cost $4,000 to $5,000. Some jurisdictions hire contractors that charge a per-mile fee.\par \par \uc2 It's typically up to prosecuting agencies to foot the tab to extradite prisoners, but in some cases their counterparts will chip in or offer other help because they are eager to unload suspects -- and the daily costs of housing them.\par \par \uc2 Kennard said some sheriffs are asking their counterparts to ship the prisoner halfway to split costs. His organization is also trying to work out an arrangement with the U.S. Marshals Service to transport more county prisoners along with federal suspects.\par \par \uc2 Federal authorities have a national program that seeks to help counties ship some prisoners at a "minimal cost," said Bill Sorukas, a chief inspector with the U.S. Marshals. In fiscal year 2009, the program moved 1,208 prisoners who weren't in the federal system. That's just a fraction of the 350,000 federal prisoners moved the same time span.\par \par \uc2 Sorukas said there's only so much the system can do without more federal funding. Getting federal inmates to their court appearances remains the top priority.\par \par \uc2 Then-U.S. Sen. Joe Biden introduced legislation in 2008 that would have devoted more federal funding to help regional and local task forces extradite fugitives. But the legislation stalled and has yet to gain widespread support from lawmakers.\par \par \uc2 In the meantime, many sheriffs scramble to find creative solutions.\par \par \uc2 Navarro County Sheriff Les Cotten, for one, shrugged off the decision by the Texas county's lawmakers to slash his extradition budget from $75,000 to $5,000. That's because he's worked out an arrangement with a contractor to ship prisoners to his Texas county at a discount if he allows them to use his jail for other prisoners who stop along the way.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors, too, are trying to rein in costs.\par \par \uc2 Derek Champagne, the district attorney in upstate New York's Franklin County, said his office only extradites smaller-scale white collar suspects if they are caught in neighboring states.\par \par \uc2 "In any crimes we have victims, we absolutely spare no expense," he said. "But if it's welfare fraud or some sort of white collar crime and it's not over $10,000 we will put 'adjoining states only' on the warrant. So if someone's in Florida and it was a $5,000 fraud, we're not spending $3,000 or $4,000 to get him."\par \par \uc2 Every decision not to extradite is risky.\par \par \uc2 One example is the case of Maximiliano Silerio Esparza, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who was captured by U.S. Border Patrol agents in 2002. Oregon officials had an old marijuana charge on Esparza but declined to extradite him. He was driven back to Mexico and released.\par \par \uc2 Seven months later, after he made his way back to Oregon, he raped two nuns and killed one of them as they walked and prayed on a bike path. He pleaded guilty in April 2003 and was sentenced to life without parole.\par \par \uc2 Ed Caleb, the district attorney of Oregon's Klamath County who put Esparza away, said the debate over extraditions puts prosecutors in a bind.\par \par \uc2 "It's a funny way of practicing law," he said. "There's some people that aren't dangerous that you wish would go to another state, and you don't extradite them back on the hopes that you don't have to see them again."\par \par \uc2 Morganelli, the Pennsylvania prosecutor, said he knows there's a chance some suspects could one day commit a more serious offense.\par \par \uc2 "We do worry about it," he said. "But we just don't have the bucks, so we can't go. I try to make sure we're protecting the public the best we can. You just never know what can happen."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press Writer Corey Williams in Detroit contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100824e68o0010c\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.    \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) - Attorneys representing an El Salvadoran man charged in intern Chandra Levy's slaying were dealt multiple blows Friday in their efforts to bolster the number of Hispanics on the jury.\par \par \uc2 Superior Court Judge Gerald Fisher rejected defense attorneys' request to access the names of jurors summoned between 2007 and 2009 as they attempt to prove Hispanics are underrepresented on D.C. juries. Attorneys for Ingmar Guandique can use zip codes to make the same argument, but Fisher said they hadn't proved why it was necessary for them to use the surnames of previously summoned jurors to determine ethnic representation on juries.\par \par \uc2 Fisher also shot down the defense team's claim that the Superior Court employs a defective process of summoning jurors.\par \par \uc2 Defense attorneys Maria Hawilo and Santha Sonenberg had faulted the jury system in court filings for not issuing juror summons in Spanish or making special efforts to increase the participation of Hispanic jurors.\par \par \uc2 Fisher noted jurors are required to be proficient in English, and questioned how Spanish language summons made sense.\par \par \uc2 "It seems a little bit counterintuitive to send out materials in Spanish to attract people who are supposed to be proficient in English," Fisher said.\par \par \uc2 Lawyers for the prosecution and the defense both sparred with the judge over possible questions for a juror questionnaire. Prosecutors said they wanted to know if a juror would be open to finding a defendant guilty without forensic evidence. Defense attorneys indicated they want to know potential jurors' stance on tattoos, gang members and illegal immigrants. Guandique is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  with multiple tattoos, some of which include phrases relating to the MS-13 Salvadoran gang.\par \par \uc2 Fisher said he would not allow potential jurors to be questioned on their race.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100820e68k002ea\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

Burt Solomons, R-Carrollton, the committee chairman. "There's really not a lot of wholly accurate data."\par \par \uc2 Jerry McGinty, the Texas Department of Corrections' chief financial officer, said state prisons held 11,766 offenders who are foreign citizens in July. He said it costs the state about $171 million per year to hold them, although the federal government reimburses about 10 percent of that total.\par \par \uc2 Rick Allgeyer, director of research for the Health and Human Services Commission, said \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  health care - mostly emergency hospital care - cost the state nearly $100 million last year.\par \par \uc2 Rep. Rene Oliveira, D-Brownsville, said an Arizona-type law allowing police to question anyone they stop about their citizenship status could fill every county jail in Texas. "It would bust all our counties," said Oliveira.\par \par \uc2 Rep. Pete Gallego, D-Alpine, told fellow committee members that when making policy, "you always have to be aware of unintended consequences."\par \par \uc2 Gallego said there could be significant effects if law enforcement and other public agencies were asked to reallocate already-sparse resources to check citizenship of people in Texas.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100819e68j002be\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

Burt Solomons, R-Carrollton, the committee chairman. "There's really not a lot of wholly accurate data."\par \par \uc2 Jerry McGinty, the Texas Department of Corrections' chief financial officer, said state prisons held 11,766 offenders who are foreign citizens in July. He said it costs the state about $171 million per year to hold them, although the federal government reimburses about 10 percent of that total.\par \par \uc2 Rick Allgeyer, director of research for the Health and Human Services Commission, said \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  health care -- mostly emergency hospital care -- cost the state nearly $100 million last year.\par \par \uc2 Rep.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Austin American Statesman. Aug. 11, 2010.\par \par \uc2 State adds ammo for bargain hunters\par \par \uc2 Pssst. Hey, you. Yeah you, the Central Texan who likes to save money and hates paying taxes. Want to do both while on a shopping spree?\par \par \uc2 Then don't do any back-to-school shopping ... until the last few days before classes begin the week of Aug. 23 in many local districts.\par \par \uc2 Aug. 20-22 is this year's sales tax holiday period in which many items -- including many the kids need for school and some you want for yourself are free of state and local sales levies. In Austin, we pay 8.25 percent sales tax.\par \par \uc2 In general, the tax-free list for Aug. 20-22 includes many school supplies, as well as clothing or shoes ... priced under $100. Texas has had tax-free weekend since 1999.\par \par \uc2 "As our economy continues to recover, this tax break will help families get more bang for their back-to-school bucks," state Comptroller Susan Combs said in a statement highlighting tax-free weekend.\par \par \uc2 Combs projects shoppers will avoid $59.3 million in state and local sales taxes during tax-free weekend. That's great for shoppers. But is it great for a state government careening toward a multibillion-dollar shortfall for the next two-year budget cycle? ...\par \par \uc2 "States that have implemented sales tax holidays have reported increases in sales during the holiday period," the center reported. "There is reason to suspect, however, that these increases in sales have not translated into overall improvements in state economies."\par \par \uc2 Nicholas Johnson, director of the center's state fiscal project, recently told NPR that states are in no position to forgo sales tax revenues this year. ...\par \par \uc2 Be that as it may, doing away with tax-free weekend would be a political non-starter: Don't mess with Texas tax breaks.\par \par \uc2 We support the concept and hope Texans will take advantage of it this year. And we'd like to see Texas look into the fiscal ramifications of adding items to the list, as it did last year, when lawmakers added school supplies to the list.\par \par \uc2 Several states suspend the sales tax for computer purchases up to a limited amount. For example, Alabama did not collect sales tax on computer purchases up to $750 last weekend. Increasingly, computers are a school supply. Texas should look into adding them to the list. ...\par \par \uc2 The tax-free weekend list includes tennis shoes but not bowling or golf shoes. There's no tax on belts with attached buckles, but there is tax on beltless buckles.\par \par \uc2 We're sure there's some logic there, if not immediately obvious. Head to window.state.tx.us and navigate your way to a list of what's covered and what's not. You'll find, for example, that "backpacks under $100 and used by elementary and secondary students" are tax-free Aug. 20-22.\par \par \uc2 And the comptroller's office adds this handy definition: "A backpack is a pack with straps one wears on the back."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 The Dallas Morning News. Aug. 11, 2010.\par \par \uc2 Bogus 'birthright' battle\par \par \uc2 It's tough enough to pick up the newspaper some days. There you are, minding your own business on a sunny Sunday morning when -- whack! -- right between the eyes: In one year, 60,000 Texas babies born to illegal immigrants, 11,000 right here at Dallas' Parkland Memorial Hospital.\par \par \uc2 And every one of them a U.S. citizen!\par \par \uc2 It's true, Joe Minuteman, but tap the brakes. Yes, it might feel good and righteous to demand that someone change the 14th Amendment to fix this "birthright citizenship" provision. Yes, you know it was a 19th-century amendment meant to override some states' laws that would have denied citizenship to former slaves.\par \par \uc2 At least part of your argument is that illegal immigrants are taking advantage, slipping across the border just to give birth to U.S. citizens, who then complicate matters for federal officials charged with deporting their parents but reluctant to split up families -- or send Americans packing.\par \par \uc2 "Anchor babies," you call them. And then they grow up and go to public school and some end up in county jails or charity hospitals, living on government assistance, all because of a few lines in our Constitution.\par \par \uc2 Except that might not be completely accurate. For one thing, no one really knows how many women slip across the border illegally with the sole intent of giving birth to an American. We do know Parkland is far from the closest public hospital to the Rio Grande, and it delivers far more children to \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  mothers than any other in Texas.\par \par \uc2 Is it possible that some large percentage of them were already here? Current estimates suggest there are 12 million illegal immigrants in the U.S., about 1.5 million in Texas. Compare that last number to 60,000 births in one year. And crossing the border can be a physical challenge for anyone, much less a pregnant woman.\par \par \uc2 It's also worth considering whether this might -- just might -- be an election-year issue ginned up by some GOP senators, including our own John Cornyn, who see political advantage in stoking the base over illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 The next time you hear senators calling for a "birthright citizenship" debate, ask them how likely it is that a constitutional amendment will gain approval in their lifetimes. Remember, it needs two-thirds majorities in both houses and ratification by three-fourths of the states.\par \par \uc2 Think about it, Joe Minuteman. We agree that the nation's immigration system is badly in need of repair, that the feds have proved to be wholly incapable of enforcing the laws we have now. Our belief is that comprehensive reform -- border security, interior enforcement, a realistic guest-worker program and a pathway to legalization for illegal immigrants already here -- is the only logical way to fix what's broken.\par \par \uc2 A divisive charge to spend years sewing up a tiny hole in the net makes far less sense.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Waco Tribune-Herald. Aug. 12, 2010.\par \par \uc2 Feuding over education funds reaches new lows in political hijinks\par \par \uc2 Even before it passed in the U.S. House of Representatives on Aug. 10, the $26 billion state aid bill drew a volley of fire from top Republicans on Capitol Hill who claimed it was another bailout currying Democratic Party favor with teacher unions.\par \par \uc2 Republican leaders back home in Texas are enraged for a quite different reason: A provision in the legislation offers about $830 million to fund between 13,400 and 14,500 teaching jobs in Texas -- but if, and only if, Gov. Rick Perry provides assurance that the money won't be diverted to other expenses.\par \par \uc2 This oddly Texas-specific provision was crafted by U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Austin, in the wake of last year's funding shell game down in Austin. In 2009, some $3.2 billion in education funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act was dispatched to Texas to supplement state funds already set aside for education. Through some accounting maneuvers, state leaders instead used the federal money for other purposes, including plugging a budget shortfall. This left some Texas educators fuming.\par \par \uc2 This time, Doggett added an amendment demanding that Perry leave state education funds at current spending levels through 2013 so extra money for education allotted by the federal government can enhance education across Texas. Various education groups back this.\par \par \uc2 This strikes us as much political meddling. It puts our governor in violation of the Texas Constitution, which prohibits him from committing the Legislature to future spending levels. The Constitution mandates no appropriation of money be made for a longer term than two years. Besides, do we really want Washington telling us how to conduct and plan our state budget?\par \par \uc2 Former state District Judge Scott McCown, executive director of the Center for Public Policy Priorities and an expert on school finance, says enough latitude exists in the law to allow the governor to make a good-faith prognosis on the matter, which ought to be somewhat acceptable to Perry, who has signed such assurances before. Yet it's unfortunate that the debate over school finance has reached this low level of political gamesmanship.\par \par \uc2 Groups ranging from the Texas State Teachers Association to the fairly conservative Texas Association of School Boards are right to be rankled at how the Legislature shortchanged education last year. With extensive membership rolls, such educator groups have enough muscle to make their sentiments known at the ballot box if our leaders in Texas fail them again.\par \par \uc2 But we definitely don't need Washington getting between Texans and the leaders they dispatch to Austin. In the end, that's our business and not the federal government's.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Houston Chronicle. Aug. 10, 2010.\par \par \uc2 Ineffective tutors earning up to $100 an hour? Texas has a lot to learn\par \par \uc2 Here in Texas, we hold teachers, principals and schools accountable for educating students: Bad test scores will land them in a world of hurt. But there's no such accounting for government-funded tutors, some of whom make as much as $100 an hour.\par \par \uc2 As the Chronicle's Ericka Mellon recently reported, school districts across Texas are forced to pay tens of millions of taxpayer dollars to private tutoring firms approved by the state -- never mind that the state's own evaluation found seven of eight firms studied did nothing significant to improve students' test scores. Or that the San Antonio Independent School District found zero evidence that the whole darned program has any measurable effect.\par \par \uc2 The tutoring system, mandated by the federal No Child Left Behind Act, is supposed to help low-income kids attending schools that repeatedly fail to meet academic standards. Parents get to choose a tutoring firm from a list approved by the state, and the school district foots the bill.\par \par \uc2 That might work -- if the state were careful about who it certifies. But observers say that's not the case. Melinda Garrett, the Houston Independent School District's chief financial officer, complains that many of the state-approved tutors have no educational background: "They're doing this because it's an easy way to make money."\par \par \uc2 And once on the list, the tutoring firms stay there whether their students learn anything or not. Since the law went into effect in 2002, Texas has never removed a company from its list, despite protests from some of the state's biggest school districts.\par \par \uc2 Last year, after HISD formally complained to the Texas Education Agency about a tutoring company called Read and Succeed, the agency's investigation confirmed that, in fact, the company did give students $6.50 gift cards to recruit their friends. But it was HISD, not Read and Succeed, that got into trouble: The agency ruled that HISD was wrong not to enroll all students who selected the program, and required the district to pay the company's whopping $75 hourly rate.\par \par \uc2 We think that's outrageous. We ought to hold tutors accountable for their work. And we ought to hold our state's education agency accountable for its work, too.\par \par \uc2 It's not just wasting our money. It's wasting our neediest kids' best shot at getting an education.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100816e68g002p5\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

Guandique is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from El Salvador.\par \par \uc2 But prosecutors maintain that even if the system could be improved, that does not mean the current system excludes Hispanics. They also questioned whether giving the defense access to potential juror names could discourage some people from returning questionnaires.\par \par \uc2 MARYLAND GOVERNOR-MONTGOMERY\par \par \uc2 Md. county is battleground for swing votes\par \par \uc2 BETHESDA, Md. (AP) -- Montgomery County's troubles could be former Republican Gov. Bob Ehrlich's ticket back to the governor's mansion.\par \par \uc2 Ehrlich has made the county a focal point in his campaign. He announced his challenge of Democratic Gov. Martin O'Malley in Rockville, the county seat, and picked a running mate from Potomac.\par \par \uc2 Leaders in the state's largest, wealthiest and arguably most liberal jurisdiction wrestled to plug a roughly $1 billion budget deficit this year. Local council members -- all Democrats -- have routinely accused O'Malley of treating the county like a piggy bank noting that the county gets roughly 17 or 18 cents back in state aid for every tax dollar residents pay.\par \par \uc2 While all say they'll support O'Malley's bid for re-election, several admit they hoped for more from a governor who grew up in their county.\par \par \uc2 INSURANCE OVERSIGHT\par \par \uc2 Feds beef up state oversight of health insurance\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) -- Health insurance premium hikes will get a harder look in most parts of the country, thanks to an infusion of federal cash for state regulators.\par \par \uc2 Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius on Monday announced $46 million in federal grants to help states strengthen their oversight of health insurance rate hikes. It's the first installment of $250 million for state regulators in the new health care law.\par \par \uc2 Forty-five states and Washington, D.C., will get money for a range of projects, including drafting stronger laws, putting proposed rate hikes through close scrutiny, and upgrading their data systems.\par \par \uc2 Five states did not apply for money -- Alaska, Georgia, Iowa, Minnesota, and Wyoming -- but may do so later.\par \par \uc2 FALLS CHURCH-BUS ROUTE\par \par \uc2 Falls Church eliminating George bus service\par \par \uc2 FALLS CHURCH, Va. (AP) -- After eight years, Falls Church is ending its bus service.\par \par \uc2 Facing a tough budget forecast, the City Council voted last week to terminate the George bus service on Sept. 27. The service runs two routes during rush hour between the city and the East Falls Church and West Falls Church Metro stations.\par \par \uc2 George launched in 2002 as a pilot program with four buses that operated on diesel fuel with reduced emissions. Falls Church began funding George in 2005.\par \par \uc2 Now officials say they can't afford to maintain the fleet. The city has transferred operation of the bus service from Metro to Arlington County, raised fares and cut midday service. But if the city dips further into the trust fund that helps pay for the service, it would mean a $347,000 shortfall next year.\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON POST-KAPLAN\par \par \uc2 Washington Post Co\uc2 . warns on Kaplan division\par \par \uc2 NEW YORK (AP) -- \uc2 The Washington Post Co\uc2 . says that newly proposed federal rules could hurt growth at its biggest unit, the Kaplan education division. Its shares fell nearly 10 percent.\par \par \uc2 The government released specific standards last week that for-profit colleges of the kind run by Kaplan must meet. Otherwise, they face restrictions on enrollment and government financial aid.\par \par \uc2 The Post Co. says government data show not every Kaplan program meets those standards.\par \par \uc2 It's a blow for the Post Co. because Kaplan has emerged over the past few years as the company's main source of growth. It now accounts for roughly two-thirds of the Post Co.'s revenue and operating income.\par \par \uc2 Post Co. shares fell $33.48, or 9.8 percent, to $310 in morning trading Monday.\par \par \uc2 OBIT-KILPATRICK\par \par \uc2 Columnist, wordsmith James Kilpatrick dies at 89\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) -- James J.

He was 89.\par \par \uc2 Kilpatrick's wife, Marianne Means, says he died Sunday night at George Washington University Hospital. Means says he was being treated for congestive heart failure.\par \par \uc2 TV watchers in the 1970s knew Kilpatrick as the conservative half of the "Point-Counterpoint" segment of the CBS "60 Minutes."

(AP) - Allen County jail officials have gotten thousands of dollars from the federal government for tracking the number of inmates who are illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 The Allen County Sheriff's Department received $38,500 from the U.S. Department of Justice last year to offset the costs of housing 35 illegal immigrants and 112 people whose immigration could not be determined in 2008. That's up $16,000 from 2007.\par \par \uc2 The money is included in nearly $1.3 million Indiana received last year for housing illegal immigrants.

Marion County received more than $75,000, followed by Allen County.\par \par \uc2 Allen County Sheriff Ken Fries said it costs taxpayers $43 a day to house someone at the jail, not including medical costs. The grant money helps cover some of that amount, he said.\par \par \uc2 Jail officials began tracking the number of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  inmates in 2007 after Fries took office. Inmates entering the jail are asked where they were born and whether they are in the country legally.\par \par \uc2 Inmates who answer no to the second question are questioned by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.\par \par \uc2 Gail Montenegro, a spokeswoman for ICE, said many jails send the agency lists of all inmates born out of the country. Agents visit jails across the country several times a week to interview inmates to determine their legal status, she said.\par \par \uc2 Agents can detain inmates after their jail stays, she said.\par \par \uc2 "The goal is to make sure criminal aliens are not released back into the community," Montenegro said.\par \par \uc2 Fries said inmates from Canada, El Salvador and Mexico admitted to being in the United States illegally last month.\par \par \uc2 "If they are here illegally, they should be shipped back to their country of origin. Period," he said.\par \par \uc2 The Pew Hispanic Center estimates Indiana had an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  population of between 100,000 and 200,000 in 2009.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Information from: The Journal Gazette, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.journalgazette.net"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.journalgazette.net}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100815e68f002e7\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc29}{\*\bkmkend toc29}\b \uc2 AP Enterprise: 3 states that offer licenses to illegal immigrants see surge in applications\b0\par\par\uc2 By TIM KORTE and MANUEL VALDES   \par \uc2 Associated Press Writers\par \uc2 1,097 \uc2 words\par \uc2 13 August 2010\par 23:51\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2010.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 BURIEN, Wash. (AP) - Carlos Hernandez packed up his family and left Arizona after the state passed its sweeping immigration crackdown. The \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 's new home outside Seattle offered something Arizona could not: a driver's license.\par \par \uc2 Three states -- Washington, New Mexico and Utah -- allow illegal immigrants to get licenses because their laws do not require proof of citizenship or legal residency. An Associated Press analysis found that those states have seen a surge in immigrants seeking IDs in recent months, a trend experts attribute to crackdowns on illegal immigration in Arizona and elsewhere.\par \par \uc2 "It's difficult being undocumented and not having an identification," said Hernandez, of Puebla, Mexico. "You can use the Mexican ID, but people look down on it." An American driver's license is also a requirement for many jobs.\par \par \uc2 The immigration debate has thrown a spotlight on the license programs, which supporters say make financial sense because unlicensed drivers typically do not carry car insurance. Opponents insist the laws attract illegal immigrants and criminals.\par \par \uc2 "Washington state and New Mexico have been magnet states for the fraudulent document brokers, human traffickers and alien smugglers for years," said Brian Zimmer, president of the Coalition for a Secure Driver's License, a nonprofit research group in Washington, D.C.\par \par \uc2 State officials in New Mexico dispute that claim.\par \par \uc2 He said there is mounting evidence that the spike in license applications is a result of pressure on immigrants in states such as Arizona and Oklahoma, where police have been authorized to help enforce federal immigration laws.\par \par \uc2 Republican lawmakers in New Mexico and Washington state have pushed to tighten the laws in recent years, only to be thwarted by Democrats. The issue is less heated in Utah, where \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  licenses carry only driving privileges. People cannot use the IDs to board a plane, get a job or buy alcohol, for example.\par \par \uc2 Candidates in New Mexico's governor's race have made the licenses a campaign theme, with the Republican saying she would revoke IDs granted to illegal and legal immigrants since the state enacted the law in 2003. The Democratic candidate opposes \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  licenses but prefers a softer approach.\par \par \uc2 The AP analysis of data in the three states revealed some striking numbers: The rate of licenses issued to immigrants during the 10 weeks that followed approval of the Arizona law reflected a 60 percent increase over the annual average for last year.\par \par \uc2 By comparison, the rate of licenses issued to non-immigrants during the same period increased only modestly.\par \par \uc2 Among the other findings:\par \par \uc2 -- New Mexico issued 10,257 licenses to immigrants through the first six months of 2010, compared with 13,481 for all of 2009. The pace has intensified since April, when neighboring Arizona passed its immigration law. The figures include both illegal immigrants and legal residents from outside the U.S.\par \par \uc2 -- New Mexico issued about 417 licenses a week to immigrants from the day after Arizona passed its law through July 1. That is a big jump from the 323 per week it was issuing from Jan. 1 to the day before the law passed.\par \par \uc2 -- Utah handed out 41,000 \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  licenses for 2010 through June 7, compared with 43,429 for all of 2008. Utah did not provide data for 2009.\par \par \uc2 -- Washington granted 3,200 licenses to people from outside the U.S. through June, exceeding the pace of 5,992 for all of 2009.\par \par \uc2 Hernandez said he and his family moved to Washington because he and his wife were spooked by the Arizona law that requires officers to check a person's immigration status when enforcing other laws. A federal judge has put most of the law on hold, saying it may be unconstitutional.\par \par \uc2 Hernandez said he knows other illegal immigrants who considered New Mexico because of the ease of getting a license without documents. But he and others thought Washington would be safer.\par \par \uc2 "I know that it's not OK for people who come here to cross the border, but there's people that come here that want to contribute ... that want to follow the rules," said Hernandez, 31, who has a 2-year-old daughter.\par \par \uc2 Recent fraud cases in New Mexico and Washington show some people are trying to exploit the rules.\par \par \uc2 An Illinois man is accused of driving two Polish immigrants from Chicago to Albuquerque last month in a scheme to charge them $1,000 each for help getting driver's licenses, according to a criminal complaint.\par \par \uc2 Jaroslaw Kowalczyk of Des Plaines, Ill., allegedly ran an advertisement in a Polish newspaper boasting, "Social security not necessary. 100 percent guarantee."\par \par \uc2 In Washington, the FBI was tipped that people from across the country were coming to the state because of its license law. Three people, including one current and one former state Licensing Department employee, were arrested in June in a case dealing with the sale of identification documents to illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 "We don't think we're asking for much," said Rep. Tom Campbell, sponsor of a bill last year in Washington seeking to require proof of citizenship to get a license. "We have to have a handle of who's in our state."\par \par \uc2 In New Mexico, Motor Vehicle Division Director Michael Sandoval cautioned that it's impossible to identify any specific cause-and-effect linking the Arizona law to illegal immigrants relocating in New Mexico because of the way the licenses are issued.\par \par \uc2 The state does not require clerks to document where immigrants moved from. And clerks cannot ask if someone is in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 As a result, there's no way to distinguish between a license issued to a Swiss chemist employed with a visa at Los Alamos National Laboratory and a license assigned to a Mexican laborer in the U.S. illegally.\par \par \uc2 Washington state immigrant advocate David Ayala said it's better for drivers to have licenses, especially from a public safety standpoint.\par \par \uc2 "The people who are driving in the streets need to be tested that they have the knowledge and ability to be on the highway," said Ayala, organizing director of a group called OneAmerica.\par \par \uc2 People with licenses, he added, "have a more normal life. They can cash a check. They can rent an apartment. They can have insurance for the car."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writers Barry Massey in Santa Fe, Rachel La Corte in Olympia, Wash., and Brock Vergakis in Salt Lake City contributed to this report; Korte contributed from Albuquerque.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100814e68e0009n\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc31}{\*\bkmkend toc31}\b \uc2 AP Enterprise: 3 states that offer licenses to illegal immigrants see surge in applications\b0\par\par\uc2 By TIM KORTE and MANUEL VALDES   \par \uc2 Associated Press Writers\par \uc2 1,090 \uc2 words\par \uc2 13 August 2010\par 18:13\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2010.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 BURIEN, Wash. (AP) - Carlos Hernandez packed up his family and left Arizona after the state passed its sweeping immigration crackdown. The \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 's new home outside Seattle offered something Arizona could not: a driver's license.\par \par \uc2 Three states -- Washington, New Mexico and Utah -- allow illegal immigrants to get licenses because their laws do not require proof of citizenship or legal residency. An Associated Press analysis found that those states have seen a surge in immigrants seeking IDs in recent months, a trend experts attribute to crackdowns on illegal immigration in Arizona and elsewhere.\par \par \uc2 "It's difficult being undocumented and not having an identification," said Hernandez, of Puebla, Mexico. "You can use the Mexican ID, but people look down on it." An American driver's license is also a requirement for many jobs.\par \par \uc2 The immigration debate has thrown a spotlight on the license programs, which supporters say make financial sense because unlicensed drivers typically do not carry car insurance. Opponents insist the laws attract illegal immigrants and criminals.\par \par \uc2 "Washington state and New Mexico have been magnet states for the fraudulent document brokers, human traffickers and alien smugglers for years," said Brian Zimmer, president of the Coalition for a Secure Driver's License, a nonprofit research group in Washington, D.C.\par \par \uc2 State officials in New Mexico dispute that claim.\par \par \uc2 He said there is mounting evidence that the spike in license applications is a result of pressure on immigrants in states such as Arizona and Oklahoma, where police have been authorized to help enforce federal immigration laws.\par \par \uc2 Republican lawmakers in New Mexico and Washington state have pushed to tighten the laws in recent years, only to be thwarted by Democrats. The issue is less heated in Utah, where \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  licenses carry only driving privileges. People cannot use the IDs to board a plane, get a job or buy alcohol, for example.\par \par \uc2 Candidates in New Mexico's governor's race have made the licenses a campaign theme, with the Republican saying she would revoke IDs granted to illegal and legal immigrants since the state enacted the law in 2003. The Democratic candidate opposes \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  licenses but prefers a softer approach.\par \par \uc2 The AP analysis of data in the three states revealed some striking numbers: The rate of licenses issued to immigrants during the 10 weeks that followed approval of the Arizona law reflected a 60 percent increase over the annual average for last year.\par \par \uc2 By comparison, the rate of licenses issued to non-immigrants during the same period increased only modestly.\par \par \uc2 Among the other findings:\par \par \uc2 -- New Mexico issued 10,257 licenses to immigrants through the first six months of 2010, compared with 13,481 for all of 2009. The pace has intensified since April, when neighboring Arizona passed its immigration law. The figures include both illegal immigrants and legal residents from outside the U.S.\par \par \uc2 -- New Mexico issued about 417 licenses a week to immigrants from the day after Arizona passed its law through July 1. That is a big jump from the 323 per week it was issuing from Jan. 1 to the day before the law passed.\par \par \uc2 -- Utah handed out 41,000 \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  licenses for 2010 through June 7, compared with 43,429 for all of 2008.\par \par \uc2 -- Washington granted 3,200 licenses to people from outside the U.S. through June, exceeding the pace of 5,992 for all of 2009.\par \par \uc2 Hernandez said he and his family moved to Washington because he and his wife were spooked by the Arizona law that requires officers to check a person's immigration status when enforcing other laws. A federal judge has put most of the law on hold, saying it may be unconstitutional.\par \par \uc2 Hernandez said he knows other illegal immigrants who considered New Mexico because of the ease of getting a license without documents. But he and others thought Washington would be safer.\par \par \uc2 "I know that it's not OK for people who come here to cross the border, but there's people that come here that want to contribute ... that want to follow the rules," said Hernandez, 31, who has a 2-year-old daughter.\par \par \uc2 Recent fraud cases in New Mexico and Washington show some people are trying to exploit the rules.\par \par \uc2 An Illinois man is accused of driving two Polish immigrants from Chicago to Albuquerque last month in a scheme to charge them $1,000 each for help getting driver's licenses, according to a criminal complaint.\par \par \uc2 Jaroslaw Kowalczyk of Des Plaines, Ill., allegedly ran an advertisement in a Polish newspaper boasting, "Social security not necessary. 100 percent guarantee."\par \par \uc2 In Washington, the FBI was tipped that people from across the country were coming to the state because of its license law. Three people, including one current and one former state Licensing Department employee, were arrested in June in a case dealing with the sale of identification documents to illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 "We don't think we're asking for much," said Rep. Tom Campbell, sponsor of a bill last year in Washington seeking to require proof of citizenship to get a license. "We have to have a handle of who's in our state."\par \par \uc2 In New Mexico, Motor Vehicle Division Director Michael Sandoval cautioned that it's impossible to identify any specific cause-and-effect linking the Arizona law to illegal immigrants relocating in New Mexico because of the way the licenses are issued.\par \par \uc2 The state does not require clerks to document where immigrants moved from. And clerks cannot ask if someone is in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 As a result, there's no way to distinguish between a license issued to a Swiss chemist employed with a visa at Los Alamos National Laboratory and a license assigned to a Mexican laborer in the U.S. illegally.\par \par \uc2 Washington state immigrant advocate David Ayala said it's better for drivers to have licenses, especially from a public safety standpoint.\par \par \uc2 "The people who are driving in the streets need to be tested that they have the knowledge and ability to be on the highway," said Ayala, organizing director of a group called OneAmerica.\par \par \uc2 People with licenses, he added, "have a more normal life. They can cash a check. They can rent an apartment. They can have insurance for the car."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writers Barry Massey in Santa Fe, Rachel La Corte in Olympia, Wash., and Brock Vergakis in Salt Lake City contributed to this report; Korte contributed from Albuquerque.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100813e68d002ad\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 BOSTON (AP) - Minutes after Annetta Luc rose her right hand to take her oath as a United States citizen, she had a pen in hand and was using it to make sure her new country heard her voice.\par \par \uc2 With the help of an immigrant advocacy group, Luc registered to vote following a naturalization ceremony Thursday at Boston's Faneuil Hall, where colonists long ago agitated for their own say in government. Luc, who emigrated from the northern South American country Suriname 15 years ago, was eager to finally be able to cast a U.S. ballot.\par \par \uc2 "That was the main reason I become a U.S. citizen," said Luc, 29. "I think it's important to have that voice, because one person can make a difference, and I think maybe if I be able to vote, maybe I could make a difference."\par \par \uc2 The voter registration drive launched Thursday by the Massachusetts Immigrant & Refugee Advocacy Coalition is part of its larger effort to get immigrants to the polls during elections. It's the first of four voter registration drives at naturalization ceremonies in Boston.\par \par \uc2 Marcony Almeida, director of organizing for the group, said advocates hope to register around 8,000 new voters during the campaign drive.\par \par \uc2 "If we don't do it now, then the outcomes of the elections in 2012 and 2014 are going to be tough for immigrant voters," Almeida said.\par \par \uc2 Advocates also plan to register immigrant voters at ceremonies scheduled for Aug. 26 and Sept. 9 at Faneuil Hall and Sept. 1 at Fenway Park.\par \par \uc2 More than 6,000 new citizens are expected to be sworn in at the Fenway Park ceremony.\par \par \uc2 Typically, there are small voter registration booths at naturalization ceremonies with information about voting. But organizers say this drive will feature more volunteers recruited statewide to get as many immigrant voters registered as possible.\par \par \uc2 Besides the naturalization ceremonies, the group plans to hold registration drives in Lowell, Malden and Marlborough -- municipalities with large immigrant populations but historic low voter turnout among immigrants, Almeida said.\par \par \uc2 "I think with all the talk about immigrants violating the law and other rhetoric surrounding immigration, there's a sense of urgency to register more immigrant voters for the upcoming (state) elections and get their voices heard," said Eva Millona, executive director of the group.\par \par \uc2 Davut Sen, who registered to vote at Faneuil Hall on Thursday, said people who don't vote lose their right to complain about what their representatives do.\par \par \uc2 "(Voting) is a responsibility," said Sen, 57, originally from Turkey.\par \par \uc2 The registration drive comes after immigrant advocates in June helped defeat a state Senate-backed budget amendment aimed at cracking down on illegal immigrants getting public benefits. The amendment also would have created a 24-hour phone line to report suspected \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  workers and required the state attorney general to sign an agreement to enforce federal immigration law.\par \par \uc2 A poll at the time showed that 84 percent of voters recommended that Massachusetts lawmakers require people provide proof of citizenship to receive state benefits.\par \par \uc2 Patricia Montes, executive director of Centro Presente in Somerville, said her group also is being aggressive in registering new immigrant voters in Somerville and East Boston.\par \par \uc2 Earlier this year, a state advisory panel sent Gov. Deval Patrick a report that called for various reforms including more English classes and in-state tuition for undocumented students. Millona was co-chair of the panel.\par \par \uc2 But some immigrant activists have expressed disappointment that Patrick, who is running for a second term, has not acted on some of the recommendations.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, Republican candidate for governor Charles Baker and state treasurer Timothy Cahill, who is running as an independent, have said they favor new immigration restrictions.\par \par \uc2 About 800,000 of the state's 6.6 million residents are foreign born, according U.S. Census estimates. It is the one of the few state population groups to have grown in the last decade, census numbers show.\par \par \uc2 About 300,000 immigrants in Massachusetts are eligible to become U.S. citizens, Millona said.\par \par \uc2 --------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writer Jay Lindsay contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100812e68c001xt\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 JACKSON, Miss. (AP) - Mississippi officials conspired to take the infant of an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Mexico so the girl could be adopted by a white couple, a civil rights group charged Thursday in a federal lawsuit.\par \par \uc2 The Southern Poverty Law Center said Cirila Baltazar Cruz was separated from her daughter, Ruby, for a year before her child was returned to her in 2009 after the intervention of the group.\par \par \uc2 Cruz had the baby at Singing River Hospital in Pascagoula in November 2008. Two days after the child was born she was taken from her mother when the Mississippi Department of Human Services deemed Cruz unfit, according to the lawsuit.\par \par \uc2 Cruz -- who spoke no English and little Spanish and could not read or write -- was interviewed by a hospital interpreter. The interpreter spoke Spanish, not Chatino, a dialect indigenous to Cruz's native Oaxaca in rural Mexico, the group's lawsuit alleges.\par \par \uc2 After talking with Cruz, the interpreter told one of the immigrant's relatives that Cruz was trading sex for housing and wanted to give the child up for adoption, according to the lawsuit. Cruz said in the court filing that she tried to explain to the interpreter she worked in a Chinese restaurant and lived in an apartment.\par \par \uc2 "When they tried to take my baby away I felt that I was done wrong, and I was very angry. It was a very painful experience for me and for my baby. This is why I want other people to know, because I don't want anyone else to go through the same experience," Cruz said in a statement released Thursday by the SPLC. Cruz is back in Mexico with her daughter.\par \par \uc2 The lawsuit, which names MDHS, \uc2 Singing River Health System\uc2  and others, seeks monetary damages and alleges the state officials conspired to deny Cruz and her child their constitutional rights to family integrity, said Mary Bauer, the law center's legal director. It also alleges Cruz was targeted by state officials because of her race and nationality.\par \par \uc2 "It's hard to put a value on losing your daughter for year," Bauer said. "It's one of the most outrageous cases we've ever seen."\par \par \uc2 The child was placed in the home of Wendy and Douglas Tynes, two attorneys who lived in Ocean Springs and were foster parents. The complaint said the Tynes were seeking to adopt. The suit alleges MDHS officials conspired with a youth court judge and the Tynes to keep Cruz from her daughter so she could be adopted by the couple.\par \par \uc2 Messages left at the Tynes' offices weren't immediately returned.\par \par \uc2 Even before the lawsuit, the case had drawn national and international attention, prompting a federal review and an agreement that requires Mississippi to notify the Mexican consulate when similar situations occur.\par \par \uc2 MDHS declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 Hospital spokesman Richard Lucas said he hadn't seen the lawsuit Thursday. He said the hospital followed proper procedures.\par \par \uc2 "For us to be included in such a complaint is frivolous and entirely inappropriate," Lucas said. "Our mission includes providing care for all who come to us in need, and we did exactly that in caring for Ms. Cruz, who came to us in distress ..."\par \par \uc2 Advocates say Cruz's case is an example of a nationwide problem that is hard to document because it involves illegal immigrants who are often deported and most youth proceedings are confidential. Bauer said the law center had received calls for assistance from immigrants in other states.\par \par \uc2 For some immigrants, it's difficult to regain parental rights once they're lost. Language barriers, family court confidentiality laws and deportation are among the obstacles.\par \par \uc2 Immigrants' rights attorneys say the problem is that federal laws govern undocumented immigrants, but their children, who are often U.S. citizens because they were born here, are under state jurisdiction.\par \par \uc2 Richard Rocha, deputy press secretary for ICE, said immigrants who are being deported are supposed to retain their parental rights to make custody decisions for their children.\par \par \uc2 "If custody assistance is required, parents are able to coordinate with the proper state agencies," Rocha said in an e-mail.\par \par \uc2 That may be ICE's policy, but states usually don't adhere to it, said Marcia Zug, an assistant professor at the University of South Carolina School of Law, who has researched the issue for more than a year and documented about 20 cases.\par \par \uc2 "The separation is really the result of policies of state welfare agencies," Zug said. "States are highly skeptical of whether it's in the best interest of these children to leave with deported parents rather than grow up in America."\par \par \uc2 In an October 2009 letter obtained by the Southern Poverty Law Center, U.S. Health and Human Services officials informed Mississippi DHS Executive Director Donald Thompson about the findings of a federal investigation of the Cruz case.\par \par \uc2 Joseph J. Bock, acting associate commissioner for the Administration on Children, Youth and Families, cited a lack of reasonable efforts to prevent the child's removal and that the agency used Spanish interpreters when it was known Cruz spoke Chatino.\par \par \uc2 Bock also said state officials didn't do enough to locate Cruz's relatives to place the child with them.\par \par \uc2 "The MDHS staff interviewed did not see these issues as problematic. This leads us to conclude that this may be how business is conducted and that this is not an isolated incident," Bock wrote.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100812e68c001s0\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHOENIX (AP) - Just a few years ago, when the economy was booming, the area around the \uc2 Home Depot\uc2  on Thomas Road and 36th Street in east Phoenix was packed with a couple of hundred men congregating on sidewalks and street corners soliciting work as day laborers.\par \par \uc2 Day laborers, mostly undocumented Mexican immigrants, also proliferated in other areas around the Valley, places like Avenida del Yaqui in Guadalupe, 43rd Avenue and Camelback Road in west Phoenix and Saguaro Boulevard in Fountain Hills.\par \par \uc2 But drive by any of those locations now, and only a handful of day laborers are left. And no longer do they rush up to vehicles en masse, waving their hands in a desperate bid to get hired. Now, they are more likely to keep a lower profile, leaning against a tree or sitting on a milk crate.\par \par \uc2 There are several reasons for the change. Arizona's slumping economy has dried up the demand for day laborers, who typically are hired for yard cleaning, moving, tree cutting, construction and other jobs. Many have left Arizona to look for work in other states, or they have given up and returned to Mexico.\par \par \uc2 And the state's crackdown on illegal immigration also is taking a toll, including parts of Arizona's tough new immigration law that took effect July 29.\par \par \uc2 A federal judge blocked key parts of the law from taking effect but left in place a provision that makes it a crime in Arizona to stop a motor vehicle to pick up day laborers or for day laborers to get in a motor vehicle if either action impedes traffic. The law also makes it a crime to transport illegal immigrants if another crime is committed.\par \par \uc2 "Things were already terrible. With the law, it's only gotten worse," said Arturo Aguilar, a 29-year-old undocumented immigrant from Mexico City.\par \par \uc2 Aguilar was among the 20 day laborers standing in the \uc2 Home Depot\uc2  parking lot on Thomas Road one recent morning, waiting for work. It had been six days since his last job, he said.\par \par \uc2 State Rep. John Kavanagh, R-Fountain Hills, who sponsored the House version of Senate Bill 1070, said one of the law's intentions was to prevent the "highly disruptive situation that occurred at Pruitt's."\par \par \uc2 In December 2007, day laborers congregating in front of Pruitt's furniture store and other businesses on Thomas Road near the \uc2 Home Depot\uc2  ignited a dispute that dragged on for two months and propelled Arizona's battle over illegal immigration into the national spotlight. The furniture store became a flashpoint in the illegal-immigration debate after it hired off-duty sheriff's deputies to chase away day laborers from its parking lot, leading to demonstrations and counterdemonstrations.\par \par \uc2 Kavanagh said the law is also aimed at cracking down on the hiring of illegal immigrants because most day laborers tend to be undocumented people who work for cash and therefore don't pay income taxes. The people who hire them also skip out on worker's compensation payments, he said.\par \par \uc2 Kavanagh said he has noticed the decrease in the number of day laborers. About 20 to 30 day laborers used to congregate every morning on Saguaro Boulevard near the Red Rock gas station in Fountain Hills. Kavanagh said he hasn't seen any lately.\par \par \uc2 "Perhaps the day-labor law, the decrease in jobs and the message that SB 1070 has sent to the \uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2  community had driven them away for good," he said.\par \par \uc2 Salvador Reza, a day- labor advocate for Puente, a Phoenix human-rights group, said he has been warning day laborers about the law.\par \par \uc2 He says the law is so vague that police could arrest day laborers for impeding traffic just for standing on the corner or raising their hand.\par \par \uc2 "To me, that leaves a huge door open (for le- gal interpretation)," Reza said.\par \par \uc2 But law-enforcement officials say the law is clear. Police can't arrest day laborers just for soliciting work.\par \par \uc2 "The key consideration is they have to be impeding traffic. It is legal for them to solicit work," said Sgt. Tommy Thompson, a spokesman for the Phoenix Police Department.\par \par \uc2 U.S. District Court Judge Susan Bolton's July 28 ruling was in response to a Department of Justice lawsuit that argues that much of the Arizona law is unconstitutional because it infringes on federal authority to enforce immigration laws.\par \par \uc2 Bolton blocked several key provisions, including one that compelled officers engaged in a lawful stop, detention or arrest to, when practicable, ask about a person's legal status when reasonable suspicion exists that the person is in the U.S. illegally.\par \par \uc2 Bolton has not ruled on other lawsuits challenging the law, including one by the National Day Laborer Organizing Network.\par \par \uc2 That lawsuit claims the day-labor provision is unconstitutional because it conflicts with the First Amendment's protection of free speech and expression.\par \par \uc2 "We are confident that that section will ultimately be stricken," said Chris Newman, the legal coordinator for the National Day Laborer Organizing Network. "The act of making oneself available for work is at its core an act of expression."\par \par \uc2 Many of the day laborers interviewed for this story said they previously worked for construction or landscaping companies. They resorted to day-labor work after they lost their jobs, some because of the economy, others after a state law took effect in January 2008 that sanctions employers caught knowingly hiring illegal immigrants and requires them to run Social Security numbers of new employees though a federal electronic worker-verification system.\par \par \uc2 Aguilar, the day laborer in front of the \uc2 Home Depot\uc2  in east Phoenix, said a few years ago he sometimes got hired twice in the same day, once early in the morning and then again in the afternoon. Now, he said, he's lucky if he gets hired twice in one week.\par \par \uc2 Rafael Mejia, a 52-year-old undocumented immigrant from Guadalajara, Mexico, said he thinks the new law has chased away many day laborers.\par \par \uc2 Gov. Jan Brewer signed the law April 23.\par \par \uc2 On a recent morning, Mejia was among only five day laborers sitting on milk crates in the parking lot of the Mercado plaza in Guadalupe, where day laborers used to line the streets.\par \par \uc2 "When they passed the law, a lot of people left," Mejia said. "A lot went to different states. Some went to Mexico."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100811e68b000ux\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) - An Ohio judge released a runaway Christian teenager from state custody on Tuesday, her 18th birthday, ending an ugly legal battle that failed to reunite her with her Muslim parents.\par \par \uc2 Rifqa Bary declined to talk after the short hearing at which Magistrate Mary Goodrich of Franklin County Juvenile Court ended the involvement of the county children's services agency.\par \par \uc2 Bary, who had argued that she feared harm from her parents because of her religious conversion, planned to celebrate her birthday privately with friends, her attorneys said.\par \par \uc2 "She looks forward to preaching the word to all the nations -- and those are her words," said Angela Lloyd, one of her attorneys.\par \par \uc2 Bary ran away from her home in suburban Columbus to Florida shortly before her 17th birthday last year with the help of Christian ministers she met on \uc2 Facebook\uc2 . Police investigations in Florida and Ohio found no evidence she faced harm because of her conversion.\par \par \uc2 Her case has drawn national attention, especially among bloggers, with anti-Islam groups warning she could face death and some Muslim groups saying she's being exploited by outsiders. Dozens of supporters of the girl rallied outside the courthouse this year before a hearing.\par \par \uc2 Her attorneys wouldn't say what she'll do next or where she'll live. They also declined to discuss Bary's attempt to avoid deportation as an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Sri Lanka.\par \par \uc2 Goodrich last week ruled that a reunion with Bary and her parents was not possible before Bary turned 18, allowing her to apply for a special immigration status for underage illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 The immigration status of her parents, who live in the Columbus area, is unclear, although attorneys for them and their daughter have said in court the entire family is seeking legal status here.\par \par \uc2 Bary's attorneys repeated allegations Tuesday that the teenager had concerns for her safety because of her conversion and said her parents didn't accept her new faith.\par \par \uc2 "She has views and she has beliefs, and the sooner the parents come to understand and recognize that, the sooner there could be down the road some reconciliation," Kort Gatterdam, another Bary attorney, said in his first public comments after a gag order dissolved with Bary's birthday.\par \par \uc2 Bary's parents issued a statement blaming "zealot attorneys" for standing between them and their daughter.\par \par \uc2 "The sad reality is that when our daughter's usefulness has been used for the political agenda of xenophobia and religious bigotry, when they have moved on to other ways of putting Islam and immigrants on trial, then they will not care about Rifqa Bary anymore," said the statement from Mohamed and Aysha Bary.\par \par \uc2 They also defended their attempts to require their daughter to complete 45 weeks of chemotherapy following successful surgery for uterine cancer this summer.\par \par \uc2 Doctors have told Bary she is cancer-free but say there is a high risk of cancer recurring without the treatment.\par \par \uc2 Bary's parents said that if their daughter Bary dies, "the responsibility will fall on her attorneys and all the religious fanatics encouraging her to ignore her doctor's orders."\par \par \uc2 Bary made her decision in consultation with her doctor and will continue medical checkups, Gatterdam said.\par \par \uc2 "I don't think it's fair to say she's given up treatment," he said. "That is not the case at all."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100810e68a0023s\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Jackson Citizen Patriot. Aug. 3, 2010.\par \par \uc2 New regulations should not be the first option after Kalamazoo River oil spill\par \par \uc2 With public anger barely subsiding from the BP spill, Michigan on July 26 suffered its own oil-related environmental mess. Somewhere around 1 million gallons of crude oil poured into the Kalamazoo River near Marshall, sparking new calls to tighten rules on the oil industry even before workers scrambled to stop the first wave of pollution.\par \par \uc2 The BP spill and this one are entirely different. One started a mile below the Gulf of Mexico from exploration and has spread across hundreds of miles over months. The latest mishap contaminated 25 miles of river when a pipeline carrying oil from Indiana to Canada broke.\par \par \uc2 One similarity should be the response. We encourage regulators and lawmakers to work swiftly to determine what started this spill -- but not to jump into new regulations that ultimately will drive up costs for the public.\par \par \uc2 Proper regulations have a place and, in fact, have improved pipeline safety in the U.S. As the Detroit Free Press reported ... updated federal rules were put in place in 1999. The number of accidents involving oil pipelines fell from 460 in 2002 to 339 last year. More money is being spent on inspections and the number of inspectors has grown.\par \par \uc2 ... Congress had been looking at the issue of pipeline safety, but not urgently. Coincidentally, the BP spill happened shortly after President Obama announced plans to allow more off-shore oil drilling.\par \par \uc2 The reality with both BP's drilling and this case is that they filled a need. Our society relies on petroleum and expects that companies can explore for and transport oil safely. For the most part, they do.\par \par \uc2 When they don't, as with the Kalamazoo River, federal officials have an obligation to find out what went wrong. In particular, there are complaints that Marshall-area residents reported a smell several hours before the pipeline was shut down. In addition, this is a 41-year-old pipeline, and regulators have raised questions about its durability and that of several other lines.\par \par \uc2 Enbridge, the company that operated this pipeline, should be accountable and pay the cost of a cleanup that will take months. If it broke any laws, there should be civil or even criminal penalties.\par \par \uc2 The biggest issue we hope federal officials can address is this: Is the network of oil pipelines that crisscrosses the nation reliable? Many pipes date back to the 1950s and 1960s and are at risk from corrosion. Is their condition being properly monitored, and are operators like Enbridge keeping up with replacing eroding pipes?\par \par \uc2 Improving this infrastructure, like rebuilding crumbling highways, can be expensive. So can the cost of adding regulators to the federal payroll. We would like to see Congress collaborate with this industry to take on the big picture, instead of merely fitting Enbridge for a black hat.\par \par \uc2 This spill may eventually lead Congress to change the way operators of oil pipelines do business. That, however, should not be the first option.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 The Macomb Daily. Aug. 6, 2010.\par \par \uc2 Meltzer's underhanded campaign tactics backfire in primary\par \par \uc2 Poetic justice: Justice, as in some plays, stories, etc., in which good is rewarded and evil is punished, often in an especially fitting way.\par \par \uc2 Was Kim Meltzer's defeat in the primary election for the Republican nomination in the state Senate's 11th District poetic justice?\par \par \uc2 We're probably not alone in asking, since the once-popular Meltzer apparently, at least in part, caused her own downfall with egregious campaign tactics.\par \par \uc2 Just a few weeks prior to the primary, Meltzer touched off a media frenzy when she announced she would propose Michigan follow in the footsteps of Arizona with laws that would force police to check anyone who could be suspected of being an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Despite the controversy in Arizona, where national organizations threaten to boycott travel in the state and cancel conventions and trade shows, many conservatives jumped on the Meltzer bandwagon.\par \par \uc2 It was an obvious ploy for pre-election publicity and it worked. Meltzer was on television, radio news shows and quoted in virtually every newspaper in southeastern Michigan, including this one.\par \par \uc2 But the state representative was still facing two well-known opponents also seeking the GOP nomination in the 11th Senate District.\par \par \uc2 Jack Brandenburg and Leon Drolet are both former state representatives and, like Meltzer, are pro-business, anti-tax advocates.\par \par \uc2 It was going to be a difficult choice for GOP voters, since the three have similar positions on key issues.\par \par \uc2 That was probably a factor in the candidates turning the campaign into what one publication labeled "the Macomb County Chainsaw Massacre."\par \par \uc2 Like any campaign that hits below the belt, we can't be sure who took the first swing.\par \par \uc2 But we are sure that a late campaign flier from Meltzer set a new low for underhanded tactics.\par \par \uc2 One side of the flier showed an obviously doctored photo of a hitchhiking Brandenburg with the slogan "Hit the road Jack, and don't ya come back no more," a reference to a recording by Ray Charles. It included references to Brandenburg's voting record and an unproven reference to a sexual harassment claim, among other things.\par \par \uc2 But it was the flip-side that was really outlandish.\par \par \uc2 It said that Drolet "cosponsored (a) bill that would have allowed sexual acts between homosexuals in public restrooms, public parks and public restrooms -- exposing our children to that filth."\par \par \uc2 We'll forgive Meltzer mentioning public restrooms twice in the same sentence.\par \par \uc2 But we won't forgive her for setting a new low in trashy campaigning.\par \par \uc2 Oh, and by the way, Jack Brandenburg won the GOP nomination and will face Democrat Jim Ayers in the general election.\par \par \uc2 And Drolet? He has filed a libel lawsuit against Meltzer.\par \par \uc2 And she may also lose in court.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Times Herald. Aug. 3, 2010.\par \par \uc2 Automakers' improvement is good news\par \par \uc2 Critics of big government continue to argue against Washington's financial rescue of Chrysler and General Motors. While the debate about government intervention rages on, there's no question that both auto manufacturers are showing significant signs of recovery.\par \par \uc2 Chrysler LLC\uc2 , the smallest of the Big Three, is the latest domestic automaker to deliver good news. Its Sterling Heights assembly plant, once slated to close in 2012, will add a second shift next year and 900 workers.\par \par \uc2 The announcement came as President Barack Obama visited Chrysler's Jefferson North plant in Detroit. The president was there to defend the government bailout of Chrysler and GM, and the new jobs bolstered his case.\par \par \uc2 Washington's controversial rescue of the ailing automakers was unprecedented. Its managed bankruptcies of Chrysler and GM and mandates for the production of smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles angered big government opponents and raised concerns about the auto industry's future.\par \par \uc2 Without government intervention, however, the nation's auto industry almost certainly would have collapsed, a fact the president didn't understate.\par \par \uc2 "If we had done nothing, not only were your jobs gone, but supplier jobs were gone and dealership jobs were gone, and the communities that depend on them would have been wiped out," Obama said.\par \par \uc2 Thanks to the bailout, the fortunes of the auto industry are showing promise.\par \par \uc2 GM used the president's visit to its Hamtramck factory to announce 45,000 Chevrolet Volt electric vehicles will be built in 2012 instead of the 30,000 it previously planned.\par \par \uc2 Moreover, the automaker is expected to file for approval with the Securities and Exchange Commission this month to become a publicly traded company. GM has repaid almost $7 billion in government loans. It can repay the remaining $43 billion only when it returns to the public market.\par \par \uc2 The growing health of GM and Chrysler is encouraging news for Michigan. Although the auto industry won't be as big as it once was, it still is a leading source of economic development and badly needed jobs.\par \par \uc2 It's also promising news for the Blue Water Area. St. Clair County's manufacturing base is tied to the auto industry through the production of auto parts.\par \par \uc2 County leaders are developing a strategy to create new industries and wean manufacturing from its traditional auto industry dependence. Still, the automakers' recovery promises to be an economic boost.\par \par \uc2 Phil Leonard, a plant manager at Punch Tech in Marysville, a third-tier parts supplier to Chrysler, said for the first time in two years, Punch Tech is running overtime shifts.\par \par \uc2 Leonard is a firm believer in the bailout.\par \par \uc2 Without it, "we wouldn't be here," he said.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 The Oakland Press. Aug. 2, 2010.\par \par \uc2 Crackdown on health care fraud is a must\par \par \uc2 If the congressionally approved health care overhaul has any chance of succeeding, federal agencies will have to figure out how to keep tabs on its expenses.\par \par \uc2 That was made obvious earlier this month when federal authorities announced the largest Medicare fraud bust in history.\par \par \uc2 The numbers are staggering.\par \par \uc2 Ninety-four persons, including many doctors and nurses, were indicted in five states, including Michigan.\par \par \uc2 They are accused of cheating the government out of $251 million by billing Medicare for unnecessary equipment, physical therapy and HIV treatments that patients never received.\par \par \uc2 And in a separate Brooklyn case, authorities indicted six patients who shopped their Medicare numbers to various clinics. More than 3,744 claims were submitted on behalf of one woman in the past six years.\par \par \uc2 We're not private investigators, but how is it possible for our government to approve 3,744 health care claims from the same person? Obviously, there was a major lapse of oversight.\par \par \uc2 As might be expected, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder put a positive spin on the bust.\par \par \uc2 "With today's arrests we're putting would-be criminals on notice: Health care fraud is no longer a safe bet," Holder said in a report by The Associated Press.\par \par \uc2 We're glad to hear that, but the statement begs the question: Why was it ever considered "a safe bet?"\par \par \uc2 Fraud is not new in federal programs and critics for decades have been crying for the government to clamp down on it.\par \par \uc2 News reports said that 360 agents took part in the one-day raids. They arrested a total of 36 people -- or one person for each 10 federal agents.\par \par \uc2 There will always be a certain criminal element -- even licensed doctors -- who see the government as an easy mark for a quick buck. Why not bill Medicare dozens of times for the same wheelchair?\par \par \uc2 Now, however, there are reports organized crime has infiltrated Medicare fraud because it brings in more money than dealing illegal drugs and, if caught, has less severe criminal penalties.\par \par \uc2 We wish Holder, and everyone else in the federal government, good luck on the crackdown.\par \par \uc2 Particularly when it's noted that cleaning up the estimated $60 billion to $90 billion a year in Medicare fraud is a key for paying for President Barack Obama's controversial health care plan.\par \par \uc2 The president worked hard to get Congress to approve his plan -- with all its known and unknown problems. The jury is still out on how successful the plan will be as far as health care costs are concerned. ...\par \par \uc2 There's no doubt we need health care reform. The question is if the current plan is the answer.\par \par \uc2 Common sense tells us no, but instead of throwing it out, use it as a base and then improve upon it.\par \par \uc2 In political Washington, that's going to be difficult, but not impossible.\par \par \uc2 If you have your health, life is good, but a little spending money doesn't hurt either.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100809e689002a8\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) - A former Indiana congressman whose career derailed in an alcohol-related crash in 1982 says he spent four months smuggling Brazilian families across the Canadian border in hopes of finding better lives.\par \par \uc2 In an online book about his experiences, Joel Deckard, 68, calls the eight trips he made into Canada with undocumented Brazilian workers and their families in late 2007 and early 2008 "the most interesting of my life."\par \par \uc2 Canadian officials familiar with the sites described in the book and with \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  crossings say Deckard's accounts are credible. "Incidents like that are a common occurrence," said Kirk Martin, sheriff of the county featured in the book.\par \par \uc2 Deckard, who served four terms in the Indiana House of Representatives and represented the 8th District for two terms, approached The Herald-Times of Bloomington with his story in hopes of drumming up interest in his book, the newspaper reported.\par \par \uc2 Deckard told the newspaper that he got involved in smuggling while working in Jacksonville, Fla., where he ran a transportation company after a serious of professional and personal setbacks following the 1982 crash in Posey County that helped Democrat Frank McCloskey defeat Deckard for the congressional seat.\par \par \uc2 Deckard said a friend in Florida was approached by a man who wanted passage for Brazilians living in the U.S. to Toronto, which is a magnet for immigrants who can find work without government work permits or social security numbers.\par \par \uc2 The idea appealed to Deckard, who said he had helped several people in the Brazilian community fill out immigration forms and get money owed them by a cleaning company, even after learning the workers lacked legal documentation.\par \par \uc2 "Nearly all of these people were family people. They were trying to get to Canada to make a better life for themselves. I was serving, I think, a highly moral purpose at great risk in order to help them make a better life for themselves. It's as simple as that. They were good, honest, hardworking, religious people."\par \par \uc2 Deckard said he charged the immigrants fees for his work.\par \par \uc2 "It was exciting; there is no question about that. It was something that very few people can say that they've done."\par \par \uc2 He said he never asked his passengers' U.S. immigration status, but he said he assumed that what he was doing violated laws in both countries. Canadian and U.S. border officers questioned him about his frequent trips, and he quit after becoming convinced he was about to be arrested.\par \par \uc2 "I knew that I could be taken into custody," Deckard said. "Every trip, I knew it could end up that way. I tried to steel myself to the possibility that I could be apprehended and jailed."\par \par \uc2 Gail Montenegro, a public affairs officer with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency, said people caught transporting illegal aliens for pay within the United States can face up to 10 years in prison.\par \par \uc2 She said a U.S. Attorney's office would have to decide whether someone would be prosecuted for activities years in the past.\par \par \uc2 Deckard said he knows disclosing his activities could have legal consequences but has no regrets about what he did.\par \par \uc2 "I was interested in helping families find a better place and a better life for themselves. This wasn't taking any job away from any American. It was simply a matter of helping people out. It certainly wasn't a matter of getting rich."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Online: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.joeldeckard.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.joeldeckard.com}}}\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Information from: The Herald-Times, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.heraldtimesonline.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.heraldtimesonline.com}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100808e688001xh\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

He said the shutdown was ordered because a backlog of claims was delaying benefits for legal workers.\par \par \uc2 Republicans are calling for a state audit to determine if the department broke laws requiring verification of citizenship before benefits are paid.\par \par \uc2 In its annual report to lawmakers, the department warned it had shut down the computers.\par \par \uc2 "Because of excessive workload and a lack of staff, in February 2009, the Unemployment Insurance Program director elected to disable temporarily the programming that denied unemployment insurance benefit payments when the Verification of Personal Information was not received," the report noted.\par \par \uc2 Deputy executive director Gary Estenson said the data-checking software is still turned off, but state officials have been checking identification of applicants to ensure they are entitled before benefits are authorized.\par \par \uc2 Rep. B.J. Nikkel, a Republican from Loveland who sits on the House State Affairs Committee that received the report, said lawmakers receive a lot of reports and there was no discussion about the issue.\par \par \uc2 "There should have been a discussion about that. This isn't something you slip into a report and don't say anything about it," she said.\par \par \uc2 The department was required to check immigration status to prevent illegal immigrants from obtaining certain forms of government aid under a law passed during a special session on immigration in 2006.\par \par \uc2 State employees objected when they were ordered to turn off the software and warned supervisors they might be breaking the law, according to the Independence Institute, a conservative think tank that got copies of their e-mails.\par \par \uc2 Mares said his office did nothing wrong. He said his office flagged close to 900 illegal immigrants during the first nine months of 2009, despite the shutdown.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100807e6870005g\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) - Passport loopholes offered by three EU nations could be indirectly expanding the boundaries of the bloc -- potentially giving nearly 5 million outsiders, mostly from Europe's poorest countries, the coveted right to live and work in the union.\par \par \uc2 The possible influx represents the most immediate challenge to the European Union, which is grappling with tight labor markets and a wave of anti-immigrant sentiment. But those numbers could be swollen by millions more -- immigrants or their descendants living in other hardship regions who are also eligible for EU citizenship under passport giveaways.\par \par \uc2 No reliable and comprehensive global tally exists of just how many people living elsewhere are eligible for EU passports. But the figures available suggest such passport policies could put a strain on the EU at a time when most of the bloc's nations favor putting enlargement on hold as they try to put their economic houses in order.\par \par \uc2 EU members Romania and Bulgaria already are handing out passports to ethnically linked groups or minorities outside their borders, and Hungary plans to do the same as of January.\par \par \uc2 The main beneficiaries are citizens of Moldova, Macedonia, Serbia, Ukraine and Turkey -- about 4.7 million people with living standards at a fraction of the EU average whose countries are years away from membership.\par \par \uc2 The figure was arrived at by adding up the number of Romanian-speaking Moldovans, Slavic Macedonians, ethnic Hungarians living in Serbia and Ukraine, and the number of Turks who fled Bulgaria to escape a forced assimilation campaign there during the communist era. All are eligible for EU citizenship under passport giveaway programs.\par \par \uc2 Others outside Europe and looking to escape hardship at home also are lining up.\par \par \uc2 Spain enacted legislation in January 2009 giving even the grandchildren of Spaniards whose ancestors left due to political or economic hardship caused by the Civil War the right to obtain passports from Madrid -- and the response has been huge.\par \par \uc2 Spanish foreign ministry figures from January say that over the first full year of the law, there were 161,463 applications -- 95 percent from Latin American countries -- and that 81,715 were granted. Total Latin American numbers are unavailable -- but the ministry has extended the window for applications by another year to December 2011, due to "overwhelming demand."\par \par \uc2 In Cuba alone, nearly 82,000 people have applied for Spanish citizenship and 36,415 have received it as of June 30, clearing the way for the lengthy and expensive process of obtaining permission to travel abroad -- or leave permanently. Venezuela's Spanish consulate has handed out more than 35,000 passports over the past three years, including to those who qualified before the grandparents law was enacted.\par \par \uc2 Spanish and Mexican authorities were unable to meet AP requests for concrete figures on the number of Mexicans who could qualify, but 150,000 are estimated to be eligible. Of those, more than 14,000 people have been given Spanish citizenship and huge lines of passport-seekers form every day.\par \par \uc2 More than 2.6 million people of Italian origin -- most of them also in Latin America -- already hold Italian passports. And, like Spain, Portugal grants passports to children and grandchildren of emigres -- most of them in sprawling Brazil, home to 200 million people.\par \par \uc2 Millions more worldwide are eligible for EU passports due to their origin. But for those in prosperous societies like the U.S., there is often little attraction in relocating. It's the world's have-nots who are drawn to Europe -- and the citizenships offered to outsiders are like winning big at the lottery.\par \par \uc2 European policymakers are attuned to the need to replenish work forces as the population ages rapidly. Most EU nations approved a new "blue card" workers visa program earlier this year to lure highly skilled labor to fill growing job gaps -- and to pay for pension plans -- across the 27-nation bloc.\par \par \uc2 But the fear linked to the passport giveaways is that they will attract people with little or no skills who then will burden the system instead of paying for it.\par \par \uc2 In a reflection of job and social benefits protectionism within the European Union, Romanians and Bulgarians -- generally the poorest of the EU's citizens -- are still required to get work permits in 10 West European EU nations. Austria and Germany have gone even further, placing the same restriction on Czechs, Slovaks, Slovenes, Estonians, Latvians Lithuanians, Hungarians and Poles.\par \par \uc2 While all those limits will expire by 2013 at the latest, they mirror the reluctance of rich EU nations to open up to their poorer neighbors -- some of the very nations that are now swelling the ranks of their citizens by passport giveaways.\par \par \uc2 Even in relatively prosperous Turkey, last year's per capita income was a quarter that in Germany, where the average yearly earnings equaled over $40,000. Moldovans, at the bottom of the scale, earned an average of only $1,500 last year, according to the World Bank.\par \par \uc2 In Moldova, where two-thirds of the population speaks Romanian, approximately 120,000 people now have Romanian passports. And the government in Bucharest says that another 800,000 of the nation's 4 million people have applied since Romanian President Traian Basescu signed a law eight months ago extending Romanian citizenship to Romanian-speaking Moldovans.\par \par \uc2 Romania says it is merely giving back citizenship to people who were part of the country until 1940 when today's Moldova was annexed by Russia.\par \par \uc2 About 15 percent of the country's 4 million people already live elsewhere, according to the International Organization for Migration. And with a Romanian passport in hand, many will be changing their \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  status to legal residency -- in Romania or further afield within the EU.\par \par \uc2 Basescu put that number higher, saying about 1 million Moldovans were working illegally in the EU. "We have an obligation of blood to support them," he told the AP.\par \par \uc2 Other EU countries have been careful not to publicly criticize Basescu and government leaders of other countries extending passports to outsiders.\par \par \uc2 Britain's Foreign Office said the issue of granting citizenship "is a matter for member states." Romanian Foreign Minister Teodor Baconschi told the AP that "no foreign minister has opened this subject."\par \par \uc2 But clearly the prospects of a mass influx is a sensitive issue.\par \par \uc2 Sarah Mulley, of the Institute for Public Policy Research think tank, says that even though passport giveaways are likely to have a limited impact in Britain, they could influence the already heated public debate about immigration and will "raise questions about how the EU coordinates policies between countries."\par \par \uc2 About 1.4 million Slavs in Macedonia -- where the average yearly income is just over $4,500 -- also are eligible for EU passports from neighboring Bulgaria, which considers them Bulgarians with a dialect.\par \par \uc2 And then there are Bulgaria's Turks. Some 300,000 fled or were expelled in the 1980s, under a communist campaign of forced assimilation. Although most remain in Turkey, all have either opened a fast track to the EU by reclaiming their Bulgarian passports or have the right to do so -- even as Ankara continues its struggle with Brussels over EU membership.\par \par \uc2 Budapest, meanwhile, plans to offer dual citizenship -- and passports -- to millions of ethnic Hungarians outside its borders, including 300,000 in Serbia and about 160,000 in Ukraine -- countries with annual per capita incomes of just under $6,000 and $2,500 respectively.\par \par \uc2 But it's the Moldovans who stand to benefit most.\par \par \uc2 With her Romanian passport in hand, Larisa Saptebani is leaving for Italy in 10 days to work as a care giver. She has been promised 1,700 euros -- nearly $2,200 -- a month, a dream wage more than 10 times what her countrywomen earn at home.\par \par \uc2 "I can now work legally," she says, beaming.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Jahn reported from Vienna.

His PMA Group Incorporated was located just outside Washington in Arlington, Virginia, and the indictment was brought in U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Virginia.\par \par \uc2 PMA was closed last year after the FBI raided its offices.

Four to six of those hurricanes could become major storms with sustained winds of at least 111 mph.\par \par \uc2 That's slightly fewer storms than NOAA expected in May.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SALT LAKE CITY (AP) - The attorney for one of the women accused of inappropriately accessing the personal information of 1,300 purported illegal immigrants said Wednesday that his client denies any wrongdoing.\par \par \uc2 Attorney Loni DeLand said Teresa Bassett has told him that she didn't have anything to do with the creation of the list and she doesn't know who did. The list of names was anonymously sent to law enforcement and local media, demanding that those on it be deported. However, some identified on the list have said they're in the country legally.\par \par \uc2 The public release of the list created panic among many in the Hispanic community who feared they would be unfairly targeted by immigration officials.\par \par \uc2 State officials have said nearly all of the information on the list was obtained from state files at the Department of Workforce Services, which administers food stamps and other benefits. The list includes information such as Social Security numbers, birth dates, workplaces, addresses and phone numbers. Names of children are included, along with due dates of pregnant women.\par \par \uc2 DWS collects that information to determine for which benefits a person's family is eligible.\par \par \uc2 Bassett is a computer specialist who is in the process of being fired from the Department of Workforce Services. DeLand said Bassett accessed the files as part of her official duties.\par \par \uc2 "Each case has a file number and apparently they looked at the number of times that she and other employees had accessed those accounts. With her, the number was something like 400. But that's what she does with her job -- access those accounts all the time," DeLand said. "She handles incoming calls and inquiries. ...She needs to look at them and determine whether to forward that file to someone who can deal with that individual."\par \par \uc2 DeLand said Bassett doesn't remember accessing any specific cases on the list.\par \par \uc2 The other person identified in the case is Leah Carson, a temporary worker who worked in the imaging department who has already been fired. It wasn't immediately clear whether Carson had obtained an attorney.\par \par \uc2 DeLand said he has told Bassett not to have any contact with Carson.\par \par \uc2 The Utah Attorney General's Office has launched a criminal investigation into the creation and distribution of the list.\par \par \uc2 Intentionally releasing a private record in Utah is a misdemeanor punishable by up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine. The attorney general's office has also shared information with the U.S. Attorney's Office to determine if any federal laws were broken.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100804e684002tb\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) - Gov. Dave Heineman said Wednesday that he would likely back an Arizona-style immigration law for Nebraska, and Attorney General Jon Bruning said state lawmakers would get to consider such a bill when they convene again in January.\par \par \uc2 Bruning told The Associated Press on Wednesday that he was "100 percent sure" such an immigration bill would be introduced in the next session.\par \par \uc2 Earlier, Heineman said at a news conference that he would likely support such a measure and that he has had several informal conversations with Bruning about how an Arizona-style law might work in Nebraska.\par \par \uc2 A federal judge last week blocked key aspects of the Arizona law from taking effect, including provisions requiring immigrants to carry their papers and banning illegal immigrants from soliciting employment in public places, and one allowing officers to make warrantless arrests of suspected illegal immigrants for crimes that can lead to deportation.\par \par \uc2 Critics of the law argued that it would lead to widespread racial profiling by law enforcement.\par \par \uc2 Bruning said Nebraska's bill would include a provision similar to Arizona's that requires law enforcement to check people's immigration status while enforcing other laws, because he thinks there's a good chance the provision will ultimately be upheld by the courts.\par \par \uc2 He declined to specify what parts of the Arizona law he thought were unconstitutional, but he said they wouldn't be included in the Nebraska bill.\par \par \uc2 Heineman's likely support of such a measure doesn't come as a surprise -- he is a conservative Republican who often speaks out against illegal immigration. But he previously indicated that he wasn't sure an Arizona-style law would work in his state.\par \par \uc2 On Wednesday, he said he believes most Nebraskans support such a law.\par \par \uc2 "Conceptually, there is a lot about the Arizona law that has strong support in our state," Heineman said.\par \par \uc2 His Democratic opponent in the governor's race, Mike Meister, criticized Heineman's support of an Arizona-style bill in Nebraska.\par \par \uc2 "He would rather waste your money on a political sideshow than talk about the real problems in Nebraska, " Meister said in a statement. "An Arizona-style law would incite an instant lawsuit taking needed funds away from health and human services and education."\par \par \uc2 There are an estimated 45,000 illegal immigrants in Nebraska, which is about one-tenth the number in Arizona, according to the Pew Hispanic Center.\par \par \uc2 Nebraska isn't alone in pursuing an Arizona-type law even though it doesn't have a huge \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  population and is far from the border with Mexico. Conservative lawmakers in nearly 20 other states have said they hoped to follow in Arizona's footsteps.\par \par \uc2 Sen. Chris Langemeier, of Schuyler, who is a registered Republican, said he doubted that Heineman's support of an Arizona-style law would influence lawmakers' positions on a similar bill.\par \par \uc2 "On other issues his support makes a difference, but on this issue, deep down in everyone's mind they have an opinion so I don't think his weight behind it would make a difference," Langemeier said. He added that budget problems would likely consume lawmakers during the upcoming session and that "there will be a limited group that wants to tackle" an Arizona-style bill.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Online:\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.governor.nebraska.gov/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.governor.nebraska.gov/}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100804e68400284\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc49}{\*\bkmkend toc49}\b \uc2 Va. police: \uc2 Illegal immigrant\uc2  charged with killing nun and injuring 2 others in car crash\b0\par\par\uc2 By KATHLEEN MILLER   \par \uc2 Associated Press Writer\par \uc2 730 \uc2 words\par \uc2 3 August 2010\par 18:54\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2010.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) - An \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  awaiting a deportation ruling has been charged with killing a nun and critically injuring two others in a drunken driving crash that has sparked criticism of how immigration enforcement is handled.\par \par \uc2 A local official in the Virginia suburb where the crash happened and a congressman from another state have criticized federal officials for not removing the suspect from the country after previous arrests, and even U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano questioned why his deportation was taking so long. A spokeswoman for the nuns' order, meanwhile, said they're upset that the tragedy is being politicized.\par \par \uc2 Twenty-three-year-old Carlos Martinelly Montano, who police say is illegally in the country, is charged with drunken driving, involuntary manslaughter and felony driving on a revoked license after the accident on Sunday in Virginia's Prince William County. Montano was arrested two times before and charged with drunken driving, according to county police, and has also been arrested in separate incidents for other traffic-related offenses. Police say Montano, who is from Bolivia, was turned over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement after at least one arrest, and a prosecutor said he knew of at least one other occasion he'd been referred to immigration officials.\par \par \uc2 The Department of Homeland Security said Tuesday that Montano was released in 2008, pending an immigration judge's review of his case. As of August 2010, a judge had not ruled on his deportation.\par \par \uc2 U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano called the crash a "terrible thing" when asked about the incident during an unrelated news conference at D.C. police headquarters Tuesday. Napolitano said she immediately asked officials to look into the situation.\par \par \uc2 "This is a horrible case," said Napolitano, whose department includes ICE. "Why is it that this individual was still out driving? He was in removal proceedings. Why were the removal proceedings taking so long?"\par \par \uc2 Prince William County's top elected leader and a Kentucky congressman, both Republicans, criticized federal immigration officials for not deporting Montano.\par \par \uc2 "As the facts surrounding this tragic case continue to come to light, I think it demonstrates the need for ICE to be more efficient and effective in their deportation duties," Kentucky Congressman Hal Rogers said in an e-mailed statement.\par \par \uc2 Corey Stewart, the chairman of Prince William County's Board of Supervisors, says the accident highlights the need for federal immigration reform. Stewart championed and implemented one of the nation's strictest county-level anti-illegal immigration policies. The local law requires that police inquire about the immigration status of all people arrested on suspicion of violating a state or local law. He says it's "extremely frustrating" that even with the county's policy, not all those turned over to ICE are removed from the country.\par \par \uc2 "We handed him over to the feds assuming he would be deported, but instead federal authorities released him back into the neighborhood and he killed a nun," Stewart said. "We feel like we are beating our heads against the wall."\par \par \uc2 A Catholic nun and spokeswoman for the Benedictine Sisters of Virginia says sisters of the three nuns involved in the accident have always stayed out of the debate over immigration. Sister Glenna Smith says the Catholic nuns have always provided social services -- including adult literacy courses and counseling -- regardless of immigration status, and they are upset the tragedy has become fodder for policy debate.\par \par \uc2 "The Benedictine Sisters are dismayed and saddened that this tragedy has been politicized and become an apparent forum for the illegal immigration agenda," Smith said. "It is not optional for us to choose mercy and forgiveness. We know this young man will be brought to justice, that's appropriate, and we hope he will learn to make better choices."\par \par \uc2 Montano's car crossed a median Sunday morning when it hit the car carrying three nuns, police said. Sixty-six-year-old Sister Denise Mosier was pronounced dead on the scene, and two other nuns -- Sister Charlotte Lange and Sister Connie Ruth Lupton -- were critically injured and remained in a hospital on respirators Tuesday, according to Smith.\par \par \uc2 It wasn't clear from jail records if Montano had an attorney.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press Writer Nafeesa Syeed in Washington contributed to this article.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100803e683003d8\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc50}{\*\bkmkend toc50}\b \uc2 Utah lawmaker says his immigration bill lacks some of the provisions a judge blocked in Ariz.\b0\par\par\uc2 By BROCK VERGAKIS   \par \uc2 Associated Press Writer\par \uc2 635 \uc2 words\par \uc2 3 August 2010\par 17:55\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2010.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SALT LAKE CITY (AP) - A Utah lawmaker writing an immigration bill inspired by Arizona's tough new law said Tuesday he is omitting many of the provisions a federal judge blocked last week that were considered the heart of the law.\par \par \uc2 Rep. Stephen Sandstrom told The Associated Press his bill won't make it illegal to solicit employment in public places. That was a major component of the Arizona law aimed at day laborers that U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton blocked.\par \par \uc2 Sandstrom, R-Orem, also said his bill would clarify that the only person police could question about immigration status during traffic stops is the person who committed the infraction - not other vehicle occupants.\par \par \uc2 "I think it still has the same goals - to let people know in Utah we enforce the law - but we're not going to do so in a punitive way," he said.\par \par \uc2 The Arizona law doesn't specify who could be questioned when police are enforcing other laws. That part of the law also was put on hold.\par \par \uc2 Sandstrom said his bill leaves out what he considers some of the most onerous portions of the Arizona law. That includes a provision left intact that requires the impoundment of vehicles when the driver is furthering the illegal presence of an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "Really, as I looked it over, I almost want to stop calling it the Arizona-style bill. I want to start calling it the Utah immigration enforcement bill," he said.\par \par \uc2 The text of Sandstrom's bill has been a closely guarded secret, but Sandstrom said he's close to finalizing it. He plans to meet with legislative attorneys in the next few days to see if any other changes are needed in light of Bolton's ruling.\par \par \uc2 Sandstrom said the heart of his bill is still a provision that makes it a state crime to be in the country illegally. He said his bill just goes about enforcing that differently than Arizona.\par \par \uc2 "Basically, if you're here legally and never commit a crime and you didn't get pulled over for any type of traffic stop, you pretty much wouldn't have a lot to worry about," he said. "It will not just allow for (police) to talk to people and start asking them for papers. There's some significant differences."\par \par \uc2 Other parts of the Arizona law that Bolton blocked include requiring authorities to verify the status of all arrested people before releasing them from jail, and requiring immigrants to obtain or carry immigration registration papers. Sandstrom said his bill wouldn't require people to carry registration papers. But he said immigrants would probably want to do so to prove they're in the country legally should they be detained for another crime.\par \par \uc2 The Arizona law also includes a blocked provision that allows for warrantless arrests when people commit crimes that can result in their deportation.\par \par \uc2 Sandstrom said his bill would not permit warrantless arrests, but those in the country illegally would be prohibited from posting bail.\par \par \uc2 Sandstrom said he wants to make his bill public in the next few weeks and would ideally have it aired during a committee hearing Aug. 18. But he said it may have to wait until September.\par \par \uc2 Sandstrom plans to meet with Republican Utah Gov. Gary Herbert to discuss his bill next week. Herbert has said he will sign an immigration bill into law if he's still governor when the Legislature convenes in January. But he has not said how closely he would like any bill to mirror Arizona's law.\par \par \uc2 Some conservative Utah lawmakers say they see no reason to let Bolton's ruling affect immigration proposals here.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100803e68300356\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The Wichita Eagle. July 28, 2010.\par \par \uc2 Voter fraud not a significant problem\par \par \uc2 Issues often are exaggerated during political campaigns. That's certainly the case with voter fraud.\par \par \uc2 Republican Kris Kobach is making voter fraud a central part of his campaign for Kansas secretary of state. He contends that it is "a very real problem in Kansas," and he wants to take the lead in prosecuting violators. He also wants to require proof of citizenship in order to register to vote.\par \par \uc2 "We must act immediately to protect the integrity of our elections," he wrote in an Eagle letter to the editor earlier this month.\par \par \uc2 But there is no evidence that fraud is a significant problem. In fact, records in the Secretary of State's Office show that June 2009, there had been only seven cases of alleged fraud referred to local, state or federal authorities in five years, and only one of those cases was prosecuted.\par \par \uc2 "Voter fraud is not a major problem in this state," said current Secretary of State Chris Biggs. Former Secretary of State Ron Thornburgh agreed. So do the other candidates in this race.\par \par \uc2 "I'm not going to say there is a whole bunch of fraud when I don't have proof of it," said GOP candidate J.R. Claeys.\par \par \uc2 People can argue that even one case of fraud is too many. There also may be some fraud that officials don't know about. So it is important to be vigilant about protecting the voting system, enforcing laws and investigating reports of possible fraud -- as all the candidates have pledged to do.\par \par \uc2 An ugly undercurrent of this debate is the allegation that illegal immigrants are voting. But there is no evidence this is occurring -- nor does it make much sense. Why would an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , who is trying to keep a low profile, vote in an election? Why would he risk imprisonment for something that offers no personal gain, and when the odds are so slim that his vote would make a difference in an election?\par \par \uc2 A more probable concern about fraud -- or at least about potential errors that might alter an election's outcome -- is electronic voting. Some systems don't provide paper backups to document that a person's vote was accurately recorded and tabulated. That's a better issue for debate and possible reform.\par \par \uc2 All the GOP candidates support requiring voter identification in order to cast a vote. This is based more on fear and politics than any real problem. But as long as the state makes sure it doesn't disenfranchise people who are poor or old and don't have a driver's license or other official form of identification, it could be a reasonable requirement.\par \par \uc2 Though voter fraud is not a major problem, it is a serious issue. It shouldn't be exaggerated and exploited to try to win an election.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Lawrence Journal-World. July 29, 2010.\par \par \uc2 Bioscience momentum\par \par \uc2 A ranking released this week by a national site selection publication is great news for people who envision a bright future for Kansas in bioscience research and industry.\par \par \uc2 Business Facilities magazine called Kansas' jump into fifth place in the magazine's rankings for biotechnology strength "one of the most significant improvements" in its annual rankings. Kansas was ranked ninth last year.\par \par \uc2 "Kansas clearly has shown that it is a biotech force to be reckoned with," said Business Facilities editor Jack Rogers, "and it has staked a claim to a leadership position for years to come."\par \par \uc2 We like the way this magazine thinks.\par \par \uc2 Business Facilities focused on the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility and other animal health efforts under way in Manhattan, which it also has ranked as No. 2 among its top 10 metro areas for economic growth potential. The magazine also cited the Kansas Bioscience Authority for its "impressive and expanding program ... that brings together industry, higher education and government in a coordinated targeted effort."\par \par \uc2 That's all good news for Kansas. The KBA, meeting in Overland Park this week, took steps to push two major bioscience efforts in the state: agricultural research and the drive to obtain National Cancer Center status for the Kansas University Cancer Center. On the agriculture front, Kansas will become one of nine partners in a new U.S. Department of Agriculture network designed to connect research to potential commercial products.\par \par \uc2 For the KU effort, KBA approved spending $1.6 million to hire two top researchers, who are bringing large research grants with them and are expected to attract $8.2 million in additional grants in the next decade. Hiring top researchers not only brings millions of dollars into the state, it also is a key component in bolstering the application KU plans to submit in about a year to become a National Cancer Center.\par \par \uc2 Success breeds success, and the national attention Kansas is receiving for its efforts in biosciences certainly has the potential to open new doors for the state. The new NBAF facility and other animal health research programs at Kansas State University are setting the pace. Hopefully, KU and its cancer center won't be far behind.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 The Topeka Capital-Journal. July 30, 2010.\par \par \uc2 Studying history\par \par \uc2 Tales from Topeka's past are earning the city some new fans, and perhaps greater exposure of its historical sites and their significance.\par \par \uc2 Granted, the stories are from some of the darker days in the history of Topeka and Kansas, even in its territorial days, but that does nothing to detract from their importance. In fact, it only adds more drama to those events, especially if there is more to learn.\par \par \uc2 Historians, professors and authors who gathered in Topeka for the 2010 National Underground Railroad to Freedom Program Conference have been pleased with what they've learned about the role of Topeka and northeast Kansas in the widespread but loose-knit conspiracy to move slaves from the south to Canada and free states in the north before the Civil War.\par \par \uc2 The visitors also have explored the Brown v. Board of Education National Historic Site and the story behind its significance and delved into the fighting between the free state and slave state forces that spawned the term "Bloody Kansas."\par \par \uc2 None of those events are recent news, but walking through the sites and poking into the local history has meaning to those who attended the conference, which ends today. Some of the visitors are well-versed in Topeka and Kansas history, but many are more familiar with events that occurred in their states or communities and seek a greater understanding of what was happening elsewhere during those periods.\par \par \uc2 Carol Mull has spent 10 years researching the history of the Underground Railroad in Michigan but knew little about Kansas' involvement in the route to freedom for escaping slaves. "In order to understand the Underground Railroad, you need to have the experience from every location," she said.\par \par \uc2 "All these places in the Midwest have been neglected for a very long time and now they're a part of this whole story that is coming out, and that's wonderful," Mull said.\par \par \uc2 Actually, the local stories haven't been neglected by local historians or others who have heard them and taken the time to research them. But the story of the Underground Railroad obviously has captivated many people who began their research closer to their own backyards -- such as Mull, who has published a book, "The Underground Railroad in Michigan."\par \par \uc2 We're glad that Mull and others who attended the conference found so much to interest them, and hope they're inspired to mention Topeka and northeast Kansas in their next book, article or lecture.\par \par \uc2 Publicity about Topeka's history and many historical sites can only be a good thing for the community. Mull, her colleagues and their readers are welcome any time.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Kansas City Star. Aug. 1, 2010.\par \par \uc2 KC has work to do on trade\par \par \uc2 President Barack Obama would like to double the nation's exports in five years. Too optimistic? Maybe. But it's impressive that several cities, including Wichita, doubled their export performance between 2003 and 2008.\par \par \uc2 Yes, that was back when the economy was much more robust. But boosting exports is an important contributor to economic growth, and in that area Kansas City has work to do.\par \par \uc2 A recent report by the Brookings Institution says our area ranks 26th of 100 metros in export-related jobs. A total of 77,465 jobs are export-related, a respectable showing.\par \par \uc2 But in the five-year period ending in 2008, the Kansas City area ranked 63rd in the annual growth rate of its export sector. We ranked even worse -- 69th -- in exports as a share of the entire metropolitan economy, meaning we're not as internationally connected as many of our peer cities.\par \par \uc2 One thing that would help would be a bigger push from the Obama administration on the trade front. Consider the Colombian free trade agreement, negotiated years ago.\par \par \uc2 U.S. barriers to Colombian goods have already been lowered. The pending agreement would open the markets of Colombia to more U.S. products. What's not to like? Yet Congress, which must approve the accord, refuses to act.\par \par \uc2 The White House says it's ready to move ahead on these pacts, but so far the rhetoric hasn't been backed with political muscle. Promoting exports means opening markets.\par \par \uc2 For area companies, one place to prospect for overseas opportunities is the Kansas City Marriott Downtown, where the ninth annual African Growth and Opportunity Act Forum will be held Wednesday through Friday.\par \par \uc2 Attending will be trade, agriculture and transportation ministers from 30 African countries, along with scores of African and American business-people.\par \par \uc2 This conference represents a potentially lucrative source of contacts for area companies involved in transportation and farm products.\par \par \uc2 Foreign markets present an opportunity not yet tapped by Kansas City area businesses to the same degree as many other metro areas.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100803e6830032z\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) - Leading Republicans are joining a push to reconsider the constitutional amendment that grants automatic citizenship to people born in the United States.\par \par \uc2 Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said Tuesday he supports holding hearings on the 14th Amendment right, although he emphasized that Washington's immigration focus should remain on border security.\par \par \uc2 His comments came as other Republicans in recent days have questioned or challenged birthright citizenship, embracing a cause that had largely been confined to the far right.\par \par \uc2 The senators include Arizona's John McCain, the party's 2008 presidential nominee; Arizona's Jon Kyl, the Republicans' second-ranking senator; Alabama's Jeff Sessions, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a leading negotiator on immigration legislation.\par \par \uc2 "I'm not sure exactly what the drafters of the (14th) amendment had in mind, but I doubt it was that somebody could fly in from Brazil and have a child and fly back home with that child, and that child is forever an American citizen," Sessions said.\par \par \uc2 Legal experts say repealing the citizenship right can be done only through constitutional amendment, which would require approval by two-thirds majorities in both chambers of Congress and by three-fourths of the states. Legislation to amend the right, introduced previously in the House, has stalled.\par \par \uc2 The proposals are sure to appeal to conservative voters as immigration so far is playing a central role in November's elections. They also could carry risks by alienating Hispanic voters and alarming moderates who could view constitutional challenges as extreme. Hispanics have become the largest minority group in the United States, and many are highly driven by the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  debate.\par \par \uc2 McConnell and McCain seemed to recognize the risk by offering guarded statements Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 McCain, who faces a challenge from the right in his re-election bid, said he supports reviewing citizenship rights. He emphasized, however, that amending the Constitution is a serious matter.\par \par \uc2 "I believe that the Constitution is a strong, complete and carefully crafted document that has successfully governed our nation for centuries and any proposal to amend the Constitution should receive extensive and thoughtful consideration," he said.\par \par \uc2 At a news conference, McConnell refused to endorse Graham's suggestion that citizenship rights be repealed for children of illegal immigrants. While refusing to take questions, he suggested instead that he would look narrowly into reports of businesses that help immigrants arrange to have babies in the United States in order to win their children U.S. citizenship.\par \par \uc2 The 14th Amendment, adopted in 1868 in the aftermath of the Civil War, granted citizenship to "all persons born or naturalized in the United States," including recently freed slaves.\par \par \uc2 Defenders of the amendment say altering it would weaken a fundamental American value while doing little to deter illegal immigration. They also say it would create bureaucratic hardships for parents giving birth.\par \par \uc2 Quoting a newspaper columnist, Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid of Nevada said Republicans were "either taking leave of their senses or their principles" in advocating repeal.\par \par \uc2 An estimated 10.8 million illegal immigrants were living in the U.S. as of January 2009, according to the Homeland Security Department. The Pew Hispanic Center estimates that as of 2008, there were 3.8 million illegal immigrants in this country whose children are U.S. citizens.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100803e683002vh\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SALT LAKE CITY (AP) - A Utah lawmaker writing an immigration bill inspired by Arizona's tough new law said Tuesday he is omitting many of the provisions a federal judge blocked last week that were considered the heart of the law.\par \par \uc2 Rep. Stephen Sandstrom told The Associated Press his bill won't make it illegal to solicit employment in public places. That was a major component of the Arizona law aimed at day laborers that U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton blocked.\par \par \uc2 Sandstrom, R-Orem, also said his bill would clarify that the only person police could question about immigration status during traffic stops is the person who committed the infraction -- not other vehicle occupants.\par \par \uc2 "I think it still has the same goals -- to let people know in Utah we enforce the law -- but we're not going to do so in a punitive way," he said.\par \par \uc2 The Arizona law doesn't specify who could be questioned when police are enforcing other laws. That part of the law also was put on hold.\par \par \uc2 Sandstrom said his bill leaves out what he considers some of the most onerous portions of the Arizona law. That includes a provision left intact that requires the impoundment of vehicles when the driver is furthering the illegal presence of an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "Really, as I looked it over, I almost want to stop calling it the Arizona-style bill. I want to start calling it the Utah immigration enforcement bill," he said.\par \par \uc2 The text of Sandstrom's bill has been a closely guarded secret, but Sandstrom said he's close to finalizing it. He plans to meet with legislative attorneys in the next few days to see if any other changes are needed in light of Bolton's ruling.\par \par \uc2 Sandstrom said the heart of his bill is still a provision that makes it a state crime to be in the country illegally. He said his bill just goes about enforcing that differently than Arizona.\par \par \uc2 "Basically, if you're here legally and never commit a crime and you didn't get pulled over for any type of traffic stop, you pretty much wouldn't have a lot to worry about," he said. "It will not just allow for (police) to talk to people and start asking them for papers. There's some significant differences."\par \par \uc2 Other parts of the Arizona law that Bolton blocked include requiring authorities to verify the status of all arrested people before releasing them from jail, and requiring immigrants to obtain or carry immigration registration papers. Sandstrom said his bill wouldn't require people to carry registration papers. But he said immigrants would probably want to do so to prove they're in the country legally should they be detained for another crime.\par \par \uc2 The Arizona law also includes a blocked provision that allows for warrantless arrests when people commit crimes that can result in their deportation.\par \par \uc2 Sandstrom said his bill would not permit warrantless arrests, but those in the country illegally would be prohibited from posting bail.\par \par \uc2 Sandstrom said he wants to make his bill public in the next few weeks and would ideally have it aired during a committee hearing Aug. 18. But he said it may have to wait until September.\par \par \uc2 Sandstrom plans to meet with Republican Utah Gov. Gary Herbert to discuss his bill next week. Herbert has said he will sign an immigration bill into law if he's still governor when the Legislature convenes in January. But he has not said how closely he would like any bill to mirror Arizona's law.\par \par \uc2 Some conservative Utah lawmakers say they see no reason to let Bolton's ruling affect immigration proposals here.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100803e683002rt\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

(AP) - The case against a Mexican man working illegally in the U.S. and accused of killing a South Dakota teenager could be complicated because his consulate was not consulted before the prosecution sought the death penalty.\par \par \uc2 Alexander Salgado, 21, and a teenage girl are accused in the Nov. 10 slaying of 16-year-old Jasmine Guevara of Mitchell.\par \par \uc2 "After consultation with Jasmine's family and a review of the evidence, the decision was made to request the death penalty," South Dakota Attorney General Marty Jackley said.

The U.S. Supreme Court has since ruled that the International Court can't dictate terms of U.S. law in death penalty cases, but the issue continues to simmer.\par \par \uc2 News releases and communications from prosecutors consistently have steered clear of mentioning Salgado's citizenship, or his alleged criminal background.\par \par \uc2 "It's not my responsibility as a prosecutor to use the media to beat up on someone," Jackley said.\par \par \uc2 Salgado and the teenage girl are accused of slitting Guevara's throat last Nov. 10, putting her body in the trunk of a car and setting it on fire.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) - A year-old state law is saving Oklahomans millions of dollars by deporting \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  criminals back to their home countries.\par \par \uc2 Oklahoma is one of about five states using similar methods to ease inmate overcrowding in prison systems, federal immigration officials say.\par \par \uc2 "It's working," said Jerry Massie, state Corrections Department spokesman. "They're not in the system and taking up bed space anymore."\par \par \uc2 Bed space is valuable in a system that has nearly 1,300 inmates waiting to enter it from county jails.\par \par \uc2 Of the approximately 25,000 inmates in state Department of Corrections custody, about 560 are suspected to be in the country illegally. About 385 of those are eligible for transfer and deportation based on their crimes.\par \par \uc2 But corrections officials admit some deportees are likely to break their agreements and come back.\par \par \uc2 "If they've got a lot of family ties here, the likelihood of them trying to slip back in and be with their families increases," Massie said.\par \par \uc2 Border agents arrested 27-year-old Sanchez Leborio less than three weeks after he was deported to Mexico from Oklahoma in October. Leborio had returned over the southern U.S. border and was picked up in Yuma, Ariz.\par \par \uc2 He's one of eight known to have returned to the U.S. of the 185 individuals deported in the year since the Oklahoma Criminal Illegal Alien Rapid Repatriation Act went into effect.\par \par \uc2 All of the returnees face federal penalties. After that time is served, state law requires offenders be returned here to complete the remainder of the Oklahoma sentence they were serving at the time of their deportation.\par \par \uc2 Leborio, who was incarcerated in Oklahoma under the name Ricardo Sanchez Rosales, is in custody less than a mile from the Mexico border. He's charged with the federal crime of illegal entry after removal and faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted.\par \par \uc2 Afterward, Leborio must serve the remainder of his 13-year sentence in Oklahoma for possession of marijuana with intent to distribute.\par \par \uc2 Most individuals deported under the state's rapid repatriation program had been convicted of drug and alcohol offenses.\par \par \uc2 There are 136 inmates awaiting pickup and removal by federal officials.\par \par \uc2 Eligible inmates must have served a third of their sentence and have a deportation order issued by a federal immigration judge.\par \par \uc2 They cannot be serving time for violent crimes, such as murder and first-degree rape, which require 85 percent of their sentence be served.\par \par \uc2 "If they're nonviolent, this is a great program that can get criminals out of the state and into federal custody," said Douglas Stump, an Oklahoma City immigration attorney and second vice president for the American Immigration Lawyers Association.\par \par \uc2 Violent criminals who plead to a lesser charge could be eligible for deportation under the law.\par \par \uc2 Criminals who were previously convicted of violent crimes but served those sentences could be as well.\par \par \uc2 Pedro Tavares, 51, who was serving time on a drug conviction but had previously served his sentence on a second-degree murder conviction, was deported last year and arrested two months later near Laredo, Texas.\par \par \uc2 Miguel Pu, 22, was serving time for rape by instrumentation, not considered a violent crime, when he was deported to Guatemala last year and arrested five months later in Arizona.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Information from: The Oklahoman, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.newsok.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.newsok.com}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100802e682001sy\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 CHICAGO (AP) - Guillermo Campos Ojeda stares blankly at the clouds from the jetliner's window, mentally retracing the 22 years that he lived in the United States as an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 His odyssey began in 1988 with an illegal border crossing and ended in May when he was pulled over for driving without a license. In between were double shifts at a Chicago factory, a string of run-ins with the law, a marriage and his ultimate joy: the birth of his daughter, now 2, who is a U.S. citizen.\par \par \uc2 But on this flight arranged by the federal government, his journey takes a new turn: Ojeda is being deported along with 52 other illegal immigrants. Their day starts at a suburban Chicago processing center and ends with a lonely walk across a bridge from Brownsville, Texas, into Mexico.\par \par \uc2 "For 10 years, I worked two jobs. I didn't ask the government for anything, not welfare, nothing," he said in Spanish, awkwardly wiping away tears with the backs of his hands, which are shackled like those of all the passengers. "I'm not perfect, but there are consequences, and I have to pay."\par \par \uc2 Flights like this one leave from some 40 U.S. cities, sometimes on a daily basis. In the last year, more than 350,000 illegal immigrants have been deported -- about 220,000 by plane. The number of immigrants sent back to their homelands has more than tripled in the last decade and is expected to continue soaring.\par \par \uc2 An Associated Press reporter was permitted to go on a recent flight, obtaining a rare glimpse into the emotional final hours of illegal immigrants who are leaving their American lives for uncertain futures in Mexico.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 The day starts before sunrise for each of the 53 deportees brought from area prisons to a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement center in Broadview, Ill.\par \par \uc2 In large holding cells, many of the immigrants wait wrapped in scratchy brown blankets as Mexican consulate officials review their papers and give each $20 to use on the other side of the border.\par \par \uc2 Ojeda says goodbye to his wife and child over a phone in a room where glass separates visitors. Speaking into the telephone, he looks intently at his wife and baby girl. Nearby a sign reads, "No touching allowed."\par \par \uc2 Most of those aboard the flight came to authorities' attention after being convicted of a crime in the U.S. One was convicted of murder, 16 for assault, 11 for driving under the influence, nine for drug charges and six for theft. Another six had no criminal background.\par \par \uc2 By 9 a.m., they are lined up, searched and shackled -- no matter the crime. The sound of chains and handcuffs echoes down the hallway.\par \par \uc2 "I'll be on my way back, man!" a man yells at a guard as he's being cuffed.\par \par \uc2 Among the group is 24-year-old Alberto Ortiz Hernandez, who came to the U.S. as a teenager, speaks better English than Spanish and has a wife who is a U.S. citizen.\par \par \uc2 The baby-faced resident of Appleton, Wis., missed an important 2009 hearing in his immigration case and was immediately ordered deported. Hernandez didn't leave, but lived as covertly as possible until he was picked up in March for driving without a license.\par \par \uc2 He has a shot at coming back to the U.S. legally but will have to wait for several years in Mexico City with his mother and two sisters.\par \par \uc2 "I want to do the right thing," he says.\par \par \uc2 His wife, Farrah Hernandez, who's expecting a child, worries about paying bills without her husband's income.\par \par \uc2 "If he comes back the wrong way, he'll never be able to apply for residency," she said in a phone interview. "The only thing you can do is wait."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 At a quiet terminal away from the hustle of the nation's second-busiest airport, deportation flights leave \uc2 O'Hare International\uc2  Airport twice a week. They are chartered either by ICE or the U.S. Marshals Service.\par \par \uc2 As passengers are patted down and searched, security officers lay out the immigrants' bags on the tarmac, each one marked with a mug shot. One beat-up black duffel bag was filled with clothes. A green barracks bag is topped with socks. One clear plastic bag has two Spanish Bibles in it.\par \par \uc2 Moises Calvillo, a Los Angeles man with a shaved head and goatee, has one of the longest rap sheets in the group -- weapons charges, battery, immigration offenses. This is his third deportation from the U.S.\par \par \uc2 The 46-year-old arrived in 1979 from Tijuana and started making jewelry at a shop in southern California. The next few decades were laden with arrests and convictions.\par \par \uc2 He expects this to be his final trip back to Mexico. The jewelry business had been declining and communication with his eight children had been minimal. They are all U.S. citizens, including a probation officer, a soldier stationed in Iraq and a deputy for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Office.\par \par \uc2 "I can't complain," he says while awaiting the flight. "Nobody mistreated me."\par \par \uc2 ----\par \par \uc2 Some of the immigrants sent away on these flights will be back, perhaps soon. Authorities at ICE say they must carry out the law, even when that means returning the same people repeatedly at an average cost of $650 per person for the one-way flight.\par \par \uc2 "It's a fact of life. They're the border crossers, that's what they do," said ICE's chief of flight operations, Craig Charles. "They live there. They come across, and they'll get caught. It is a revolving door."\par \par \uc2 Later this year, the agency is set to start a tactic aimed at deterring immediate re-crossings. Flights will be taken to the interior of Mexico, which will make it harder for immigrants to return right away.\par \par \uc2 Even so, experts are doubtful illegal immigration will decline without economic incentives or a significant change in the law.\par \par \uc2 Most people, including the estimated 12 million illegal immigrants living in the U.S., are waiting to hear more from President Barack Obama, who so far has addressed immigration reform by amping up border security and challenging Arizona's controversial immigration law, the toughest in the nation.\par \par \uc2 "He's talked a lot," said Rene Roman Navarrete, a 36-year-old \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Acapulco aboard the flight who's crossed illegally at least twice. "But nothing has been done."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Aboard the plane, the journey feels similar to a commercial flight, except for the nearly two dozen armed guards and the soft clinking of handcuff chains that can sometimes be heard amid the roar of the jet engines.\par \par \uc2 Sitting in 9A -- a few rows away from the male passengers -- is 28-year-old Yesenia Pereyda Martinez, the sole woman in the group.\par \par \uc2 The suburban Chicago mother of three crossed illegally into the U.S. in 2000 by walking for two days through the desert. She carries a painful reminder of the journey every day: her toes are deformed and stubby from the shoes she wore. Now wearing anything but open-toed shoes is painful. On the day of the deportation flight, she wears fuzzy black flip-flops.\par \par \uc2 Martinez sits still nearly the entire three-hour flight. Her brown-bag lunch of a bologna sandwich, vanilla cake and apple goes untouched.\par \par \uc2 "I am scared," she says.\par \par \uc2 She spends the flight thinking of her children: 8-year-old Julianna, who loves to draw and do homework; 6-year-old Guadalupe, who rebels against homework; and their 1-year-old baby brother.\par \par \uc2 Martinez took a risky trip back to Mexico earlier this year to see an ailing family member for the last time. Then the smuggling van that was returning her to the U.S. was pulled over by an Illinois state trooper just hours from her home in the Chicago suburb of Cicero.\par \par \uc2 While she waits in a holding cell on the day of the flight, a guard hands her a cell phone to make a final call to Luis, a man she calls her husband, though they have no legal union.\par \par \uc2 "I don't have a lot of time, Luis," she says in Spanish before telling him she has $200 to take to the home of her father, a man she hardly knows. "I'll talk to you later. Cuidate. Gracias. Bye."\par \par \uc2 Her future plans are murky. But she knows her mother, sister and Luis will take care of the children. She wants them to finish their education. The children think their mom is just on a trip to see family.\par \par \uc2 "They don't want to leave," she said.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 When the plane lands in Harlingen, Texas, the immigrants are loaded on a bus that drives by fields of tall sorghum on the way to the border.\par \par \uc2 In Brownsville, officers unshackle each of the detainees, hand them their belongings and walk them across the high-traffic bridge.\par \par \uc2 As the group crosses, one pedestrian spots them, throws his hands up and mutters, "It's a revolving door!"\par \par \uc2 Waiting on the other side are smugglers on the lookout for deported immigrants, who are easily spotted by the bags of belongings that bear their names and mugshots.\par \par \uc2 Ojeda was among the last people released. In 1998, he tried to cross and was apprehended by border agents who sent him back the same day. He made another attempt shortly thereafter.\par \par \uc2 But this time, he says, he won't try to come back. The consequences are too great: an increased jail sentence and the threat to his health, especially because of his diabetes.\par \par \uc2 Carrying a small bag of clothes, a little cash and a two-week supply of insulin, the 40-year-old man walks over the bridge. Despite the hardship of separation, he won't consider asking his family to join him in Mexico.\par \par \uc2 "There isn't work. There aren't resources. There are a lot of drugs. There's a lot of violence," Ojeda says. "I wouldn't bring my daughter into that."\par \par \uc2 (This version CORRECTS Yesenia Pereyda Martinez's last name to Martinez on all references.)\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100801e6810003l\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc58}{\*\bkmkend toc58}\b \uc2 Regrets and defiance aboard government flight that takes illegal immigrants back to Mexico\b0\par\par\uc2 By SOPHIA TAREEN   \par \uc2 Associated Press Writer\par \uc2 1,698 \uc2 words\par \uc2 31 July 2010\par 18:17\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2010.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 CHICAGO (AP) - Guillermo Campos Ojeda stares blankly at the clouds from the jetliner's window, mentally retracing the 22 years that he lived in the United States as an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 His odyssey began in 1988 with an illegal border crossing and ended in May when he was pulled over for driving without a license. In between were double shifts at a Chicago factory, a string of run-ins with the law, a marriage and his ultimate joy: the birth of his daughter, now 2, who is a U.S. citizen.\par \par \uc2 But on this flight arranged by the federal government, his journey takes a new turn: Ojeda is being deported along with 52 other illegal immigrants. Their day starts at a suburban Chicago processing center and ends with a lonely walk across a bridge from Brownsville, Texas, into Mexico.\par \par \uc2 "For 10 years, I worked two jobs. I didn't ask the government for anything, not welfare, nothing," he said in Spanish, awkwardly wiping away tears with the backs of his hands, which are shackled like those of all the passengers. "I'm not perfect, but there are consequences, and I have to pay."\par \par \uc2 Flights like this one leave from some 40 U.S. cities, sometimes on a daily basis. In the last year, more than 350,000 illegal immigrants have been deported -- about 220,000 by plane. The number of immigrants sent back to their homelands has more than tripled in the last decade and is expected to continue soaring.\par \par \uc2 An Associated Press reporter was permitted to go on a recent flight, obtaining a rare glimpse into the emotional final hours of illegal immigrants who are leaving their American lives for uncertain futures in Mexico.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 The day starts before sunrise for each of the 53 deportees brought from area prisons to a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement center in Broadview, Ill.\par \par \uc2 In large holding cells, many of the immigrants wait wrapped in scratchy brown blankets as Mexican consulate officials review their papers and give each $20 to use on the other side of the border.\par \par \uc2 Ojeda says goodbye to his wife and child over a phone in a room where glass separates visitors. Speaking into the telephone, he looks intently at his wife and baby girl. Nearby a sign reads, "No touching allowed."\par \par \uc2 Most of those aboard the flight came to authorities' attention after being convicted of a crime in the U.S. One was convicted of murder, 16 for assault, 11 for driving under the influence, nine for drug charges and six for theft. Another six had no criminal background.\par \par \uc2 By 9 a.m., they are lined up, searched and shackled -- no matter the crime. The sound of chains and handcuffs echoes down the hallway.\par \par \uc2 "I'll be on my way back, man!" a man yells at a guard as he's being cuffed.\par \par \uc2 Among the group is 24-year-old Alberto Ortiz Hernandez, who came to the U.S. as a teenager, speaks better English than Spanish and has a wife who is a U.S. citizen.\par \par \uc2 The baby-faced resident of Appleton, Wis., missed an important 2009 hearing in his immigration case and was immediately ordered deported. Hernandez didn't leave, but lived as covertly as possible until he was picked up in March for driving without a license.\par \par \uc2 He has a shot at coming back to the U.S. legally but will have to wait for several years in Mexico City with his mother and two sisters.\par \par \uc2 "I want to do the right thing," he says.\par \par \uc2 His wife, Farrah Hernandez, who's expecting a child, worries about paying bills without her husband's income.\par \par \uc2 "If he comes back the wrong way, he'll never be able to apply for residency," she said in a phone interview. "The only thing you can do is wait."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 At a quiet terminal away from the hustle of the nation's second-busiest airport, deportation flights leave \uc2 O'Hare International\uc2  Airport twice a week. They are chartered either by ICE or the U.S. Marshals Service.\par \par \uc2 As passengers are patted down and searched, security officers lay out the immigrants' bags on the tarmac, each one marked with a mug shot. One beat-up black duffel bag was filled with clothes. A green barracks bag is topped with socks. One clear plastic bag has two Spanish Bibles in it.\par \par \uc2 Moises Calvillo, a Los Angeles man with a shaved head and goatee, has one of the longest rap sheets in the group -- weapons charges, battery, immigration offenses. This is his third deportation from the U.S.\par \par \uc2 The 46-year-old arrived in 1979 from Tijuana and started making jewelry at a shop in southern California. The next few decades were laden with arrests and convictions.\par \par \uc2 He expects this to be his final trip back to Mexico. The jewelry business had been declining and communication with his eight children had been minimal. They are all U.S. citizens, including a probation officer, a soldier stationed in Iraq and a deputy for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Office.\par \par \uc2 "I can't complain," he says while awaiting the flight. "Nobody mistreated me."\par \par \uc2 ----\par \par \uc2 Some of the immigrants sent away on these flights will be back, perhaps soon. Authorities at ICE say they must carry out the law, even when that means returning the same people repeatedly at an average cost of $650 per person for the one-way flight.\par \par \uc2 "It's a fact of life. They're the border crossers, that's what they do," said ICE's chief of flight operations, Craig Charles. "They live there. They come across, and they'll get caught. It is a revolving door."\par \par \uc2 Later this year, the agency is set to start a tactic aimed at deterring immediate re-crossings. Flights will be taken to the interior of Mexico, which will make it harder for immigrants to return right away.\par \par \uc2 Even so, experts are doubtful illegal immigration will decline without economic incentives or a significant change in the law.\par \par \uc2 Most people, including the estimated 12 million illegal immigrants living in the U.S., are waiting to hear more from President Barack Obama, who so far has addressed immigration reform by amping up border security and challenging Arizona's controversial immigration law, the toughest in the nation.\par \par \uc2 "He's talked a lot," said Rene Roman Navarrete, a 36-year-old \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Acapulco aboard the flight who's crossed illegally at least twice. "But nothing has been done."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Aboard the plane, the journey feels similar to a commercial flight, except for the nearly two dozen armed guards and the soft clinking of handcuff chains that can sometimes be heard amid the roar of the jet engines.\par \par \uc2 Sitting in 9A -- a few rows away from the male passengers -- is 28-year-old Yesenia Pereyda Martinez, the sole woman in the group.\par \par \uc2 The suburban Chicago mother of three crossed illegally into the U.S. in 2000 by walking for two days through the desert. She carries a painful reminder of the journey every day: her toes are deformed and stubby from the shoes she wore. Now wearing anything but open-toed shoes is painful. On the day of the deportation flight, she wears fuzzy black flip-flops.\par \par \uc2 Montez sits still nearly the entire three-hour flight. Her brown-bag lunch of a bologna sandwich, vanilla cake and apple goes untouched.\par \par \uc2 "I am scared," she says.\par \par \uc2 She spends the flight thinking of her children: 8-year-old Julianna, who loves to draw and do homework; 6-year-old Guadalupe, who rebels against homework; and their 1-year-old baby brother.\par \par \uc2 Montez took a risky trip back to Mexico earlier this year to see an ailing family member for the last time. Then the smuggling van that was returning her to the U.S. was pulled over by an Illinois state trooper just hours from her home in the Chicago suburb of Cicero.\par \par \uc2 While she waits in a holding cell on the day of the flight, a guard hands her a cell phone to make a final call to Luis, a man she calls her husband, though they have no legal union.\par \par \uc2 "I don't have a lot of time, Luis," she says in Spanish before telling him she has $200 to take to the home of her father, a man she hardly knows. "I'll talk to you later. Cuidate. Gracias. Bye."\par \par \uc2 Her future plans are murky. But she knows her mother, sister and Luis will take care of the children. She wants them to finish their education. The children think their mom is just on a trip to see family.\par \par \uc2 "They don't want to leave," she said.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 When the plane lands in Harlingen, Texas, the immigrants are loaded on a bus that drives by fields of tall sorghum on the way to the border.\par \par \uc2 In Brownsville, officers unshackle each of the detainees, hand them their belongings and walk them across the high-traffic bridge.\par \par \uc2 As the group crosses, one pedestrian spots them, throws his hands up and mutters, "It's a revolving door!"\par \par \uc2 Waiting on the other side are smugglers on the lookout for deported immigrants, who are easily spotted by the bags of belongings that bear their names and mugshots.\par \par \uc2 Ojeda was among the last people released. In 1998, he tried to cross and was apprehended by border agents who sent him back the same day. He made another attempt shortly thereafter.\par \par \uc2 But this time, he says, he won't try to come back. The consequences are too great: an increased jail sentence and the threat to his health, especially because of his diabetes.\par \par \uc2 Carrying a small bag of clothes, a little cash and a two-week supply of insulin, the 40-year-old man walks over the bridge. Despite the hardship of separation, he won't consider asking his family to join him in Mexico.\par \par \uc2 "There isn't work. There aren't resources. There are a lot of drugs. There's a lot of violence," Ojeda says. "I wouldn't bring my daughter into that."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100731e67v003eo\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) - The Obama administration, unable to push an immigration overhaul through Congress, is considering ways it could go around lawmakers to let undocumented immigrants stay in the United States, according to an agency memo.\par \par \uc2 The internal draft written by officials at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services outlines ways the government could provide "relief" to illegal immigrants -- including delaying deportation for some, perhaps indefinitely, or granting green cards to others -- in the absence of legislation revamping the system.\par \par \uc2 It's emerging as chances fade in this election year for a measure President Barack Obama favors to put the nation's estimated 12 million undocumented immigrants on a path to legal status, and as debate rages over an Arizona law targeting people suspected of being in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 The 11-page internal memo, written in April to the agency's director, says: "This memorandum offers administrative relief options to promote family unity, foster economic growth, achieve significant process improvements and reduce the threat of removal for certain individuals present in the United States without authorization."\par \par \uc2 It goes on: "In the absence of comprehensive immigration reform, USCIS can extend benefits and/or protections to many individuals or groups."\par \par \uc2 The memo drew a backlash by Republicans who called it evidence that Obama is looking for ways of relaxing immigration policies without political consensus to enact a new law.\par \par \uc2 "The document provides an additional basis for our concerns that the administration will go to great lengths to circumvent Congress and unilaterally execute a backdoor amnesty plan," said Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, who obtained and circulated the memo. "The problem remains that if you reward illegality, you get more of it."\par \par \uc2 Grassley led a group of conservative GOP senators who wrote to Obama in June asking him to promise that the administration wouldn't use its authority to "change the current position of a large group of illegal aliens already in the United States."\par \par \uc2 The Iowan's staff said the group has not received a response.\par \par \uc2 "Now we find out the truth: While saying one thing to the public, the Obama administration is scheming to ensure that immigration laws are not enforced," said Rep. Lamar Smith of Texas, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee.\par \par \uc2 Administration officials sought to downplay the memo's significance, saying it was merely the product of brainstorming sessions and noting that many of the ideas it suggests were first discussed when George W. Bush was president, after his immigration overhaul died in Congress in 2007.\par \par \uc2 Agency spokesman Christopher Bentley said the internal document "should not be equated with official action or policy," and represented only "deliberation and exchange of ideas."\par \par \uc2 "We continue to maintain that comprehensive bipartisan legislation, coupled with smart, effective enforcement, is the only solution to our nation's immigration challenges," he said in a statement.\par \par \uc2 Still, the memo makes clear that even without such a bill, immigration officials have identified a variety of ways to relax U.S. policy to let more undocumented immigrants who might otherwise face deportation stay in the country. Among the options outlined is expanding the use of "deferred action" -- in which the government can use its discretion to halt a deportation indefinitely, usually for an urgent humanitarian reason.\par \par \uc2 "While it is theoretically possible to grant deferred action to an unrestricted number of unlawfully present individuals, doing so would likely be controversial, not to mention expensive," the memo says. Instead, officials suggest using the option for certain groups, such as tens of thousands of high school graduates who have been brought up in the U.S. and plan to attend college or serve in the military.\par \par \uc2 Democrats and Republicans have repeatedly tried to push through legislation -- known as the "Dream Act" -- to cover those students.\par \par \uc2 "To be clear," Bentley said, the government "will not grant deferred action or humanitarian parole to the nation's entire \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  population."\par \par \uc2 Another option included in the document is to allow more illegal immigrants to receive "parole-in-place" status. This would let them stay in the United States while they seek legal status.\par \par \uc2 The document discusses applying both those options to spouses of active duty military personnel, for instance.\par \par \uc2 It also suggests expanding the definition of "extreme hardship" for exceptions in immigration cases -- a prospect that alarmed critics who said it could lower the bar so virtually any undocumented person could meet it.\par \par \uc2 And the memo suggests allowing people who entered the United States illegally and were granted "Temporary Protected Status" because of a crisis in their home countries to stay and get permanent legal residency.\par \par \uc2 The memo notes that this would be a change in long-standing policy, and says, "Opening this pathway will help thousands of applicants obtain lawful permanent residence without having to leave the U.S."\par \par \uc2 Some proponents of revamping the immigration system said the document simply points out ways the agency can fix old and outdated practices that separate families and hurt workers and employers.\par \par \uc2 Writing on the Immigration Policy Center's blog, Director Mary Giovagnoli, a former immigration official, said, "Good for you, USCIS, for trying to do what it can within that broken system."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100730e67u002jr\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

Any Arizonan can file a lawsuit to challenge agencies that have a policy of restricting such enforcement.\par \par \uc2 -- A ban on state and local from restricting the sharing of information on people's immigration status for determining eligibility of a public benefit, verifying a claim of residence and determining whether an immigrant has complied with federal registration laws.\par \par \uc2 -- A new addition to Arizona's nearly 5-year-old ban on immigrant smuggling that lets officers pull over drivers if officers have reasonable suspicion they have broken traffic laws.\par \par \uc2 -- A ban on blocking traffic when people seek or offer day-labor services on streets.\par \par \uc2 -- A prohibition on driving or harboring illegal immigrants in furtherance of their illegal presence. It also requires impoundment of vehicles when the driver is furthering the illegal presence of an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 -- Two additions to a 2007 state law prohibiting employers from knowingly hiring illegal immigrants. Although one change established an entrapment defense for employers accused of knowingly hiring illegal immigrants, it opens up the door for police to use stings to catch violators. The other change requires employers to retain records of employment eligibility checks that state law already requires of new hires.\par \par \uc2 -- The creation of a new state fund for the state police's immigrant squad and for reimbursing county jails for the costs of incarcerating illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100729e67t0004a\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) - Officers from a single Arizona county helped deport more than 26,000 immigrants from the U.S. through a federal-local partnership program that has been roundly criticized as fraught with problems.\par \par \uc2 Statistics obtained by The Associated Press show that the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office was responsible for the deportation or forced departure of 26,146 immigrants since 2007.\par \par \uc2 That's about a quarter of the national total of 115,841 sent out of the U.S. by officers in 64 law enforcement agencies deputized to help enforce immigration laws, some since 2006, under the so-called 287(g) program.\par \par \uc2 The tens of thousands of immigrant arrests show local officials already have a significant amount of authority to enforce immigration laws and help remove illegal immigrants from the country.\par \par \uc2 Arizona wanted more of its officers to be able to ask people to prove they are legally in the U.S. under its law that was to take effect Thursday. But a U.S. district court judge on Wednesday blocked the most controversial parts of the law from taking effect.\par \par \uc2 Among parts of the law blocked is the a section requiring officers to ask for a driver's license, passport or other identity document if they reasonably suspect a person is not allowed to be in the U.S. The immigration checks were to be made by officers while enforcing other laws or ordinances.\par \par \uc2 The federal government already is under fire for doing a poor job of keeping watch on local officers enforcing immigration laws and ensuring safeguards for protecting civil rights are in place. Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio is the top law officer among all those deputized. He is under federal investigation on allegations of civil rights violations, which he denies.\par \par \uc2 The government had argued that the Arizona law usurps its authority. The Justice Department said in its suit challenging the law that the 287(g) federal-local partnerships are one way Congress allowed states to assist in enforcing immigration laws.\par \par \uc2 "At the pragmatic level, if local police are already allowed to do this and are allowed to do this with federal cooperation with the state, then why do they need the (new Arizona) law?" said Muzaffar Chishti, director of the New York office of the Migration Policy Institute, an immigration think tank.\par \par \uc2 There are several other ways local officials can assist, including Secure Communities, a more widely used program that allows local officials to check the fingerprints of anyone they book into their jails against FBI and Homeland Security Department databases.\par \par \uc2 But the 287(g) program gives officers the most direct authority to stop people on the street, in their cars or in their communities and check whether they are in the country illegally. Federal watchdogs have been critical of the job the Homeland Security Department has been doing in running the program.\par \par \uc2 The department's inspector general reported in March that the 287(g) program was poorly supervised and provided insufficient training to officers, including on civil rights law.\par \par \uc2 Local officers have operated outside their agreements dictating the limits of their authority, the report said. In all, the inspector general made 33 recommendations for overhauling the program, some of which have not yet been resolved. It was the second critical report for the program. The Government Accountability Office had criticized the program in July 2009.\par \par \uc2 Complaints about Arpaio's immigration enforcement tactics led the federal government last October to yank his authority to enforce immigration laws during patrols. That month, the Obama administration rewrote all agreements with local partners in attempt to address complaints of racial profiling and civil rights violations.\par \par \uc2 Even so, the federal government continues to allow the sheriff and deputies to check their jails for deportable inmates.\par \par \uc2 Arpaio has denied the allegations and says he is a target because of his tough immigration enforcement. His office has continued to do immigration sweeps. Arpaio said he is enforcing state anti-smuggling and anti-\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  hiring laws.\par \par \uc2 Arpaio said about 100 of his deputies were trained over five weeks to act as federal agents under the 287(g) program. They were trained on racial profiling and other civil rights laws, he said.\par \par \uc2 The federal government does not pay for local officers to participate in the 287(g) program. U.S. taxpayers pay the federal cost, which has grown from $5 million in 2006 to $68 million in 2010, according to the DHS inspector general. Immigration and Customs Enforcement reimburses some of the local agencies for housing immigrants in their jails. The immigrants can be in the country illegally or legally present but have committed a crime that makes them eligible for deportation.\par \par \uc2 Joanne Lin, legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, said it is alarming that one Arizona county is responsible for a disproportionate share of deportations.\par \par \uc2 The Los Angeles County's Sheriff's Office, a distant second to Maricopa, helped find 13,784 immigrants who were later deported or left the country. The Sheriff's Office's agreement with the federal government allows it to check its jails for deportable immigrants, but not to enforce immigration laws during street patrols. A renewal of the agreement is under negotiation.\par \par \uc2 An estimated 10.8 million people, about 26 percent of the state's population, are living illegally in California, compared with 460,000, about 12 percent, in Arizona.\par \par \uc2 "These statistics bear out that you have rogue sheriffs in certain counties that are bent on targeting immigrants," Lin said.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Online:\par \par \uc2 Immigration and Customs Enforcement, 287(g): {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.ice.gov/pi/news/factsheets/section287--g.htm"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.ice.gov/pi/news/factsheets/section287--g.htm}}}\par \par \uc2 DHS Inspector General 287(g): {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://tinyurl.com/yknnfyk"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://tinyurl.com/yknnfyk}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100728e67s000uq\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHOENIX (AP) - A federal judge stepped into the fight over Arizona's immigration law at the last minute Wednesday, blocking the heart of the measure and defusing a confrontation between police and thousands of activists that had been building for months.\par \par \uc2 Coming just hours before the law was to take effect, the ruling isn't the end.\par \par \uc2 It sets up a lengthy legal battle that could end up before the Supreme Court -- ensuring that a law that reignited the immigration debate, inspired similar measures nationwide, created fodder for political campaigns and raised tensions with Mexico will stay in the spotlight.\par \par \uc2 Protesters who gathered at the state Capitol and outside the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City cheered when they heard the news. The governor, the law's authors and anti-illegal immigration groups vowed to fight on.\par \par \uc2 "It's a temporary bump in the road," Gov. Jan Brewer said.\par \par \uc2 The key issue before U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton in the case is as old as the nation itself: Does federal law trump state law? She indicated in her ruling that the federal government's case has a good chance at succeeding.\par \par \uc2 The Clinton appointee said the controversial sections should be put on hold until the courts resolve the issues, including parts that required officers to check a person's immigration status while enforcing other laws.\par \par \uc2 In her temporary injunction, Boltondelayed provisions that required immigrants to carry their papers and banned illegal immigrants from soliciting employment in public places -- a move aimed at day laborers.\par \par \uc2 The judge also blocked officers from making warrantless arrests of suspected illegal immigrants for crimes that can lead to deportation.\par \par \uc2 "Requiring Arizona law enforcement officials and agencies to determine the immigration status of every person who is arrested burdens lawfully present aliens because their liberty will be restricted while their status is checked," Bolton wrote.\par \par \uc2 The ruling came just as police were making last-minute preparations to begin enforcement of the law and protesters, many of whom said they would not bring identification, were planning large demonstrations against the measure.\par \par \uc2 At least one group had planned to block access to federal offices, daring officers to ask them about their immigration status.\par \par \uc2 "I knew the judge would say that part of the law was just not right," said Gisela Diaz, 50, from Mexico City, who came to Arizona on a since-expired tourist visa in 1989 and who waited with her family early Wednesday at the Mexican Consulate to get advice about the law.\par \par \uc2 "It's the part we were worried about. This is a big relief for us," she said.\par \par \uc2 At a \uc2 Home Depot\uc2  in west Phoenix, where day-laborers gather to look for work, Carlos Gutierrez said he was elated when a stranger drove by and yelled the news: "They threw out the law! You guys can work!"\par \par \uc2 "I felt good inside" said the 32-year-old \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , who came here six years ago from Sonora, Mexico, and supports his wife and three children. "Now there's a way to stay here with less problems."\par \par \uc2 Opponents argued the law will lead to racial profiling, conflict with federal immigration law and distract local police from fighting more serious crimes. The U.S. Justice Department, civil rights groups and a Phoenix police officer asked for Wednesday's injunction.\par \par \uc2 Lawyers for the state contend the law was a constitutionally sound attempt by Arizona to assist federal immigration agents and lessen border woes, such as the heavy costs for educating, jailing and providing health care for illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 They said Arizona shouldn't have to suffer from a broken immigration system when it has 15,000 officers who can arrest illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 In her ruling, Bolton said the interests of Arizona, the busiest U.S. gateway for illegal immigrants, match those of the federal government. But, she wrote, that the federal government must take the lead on deciding how to enforce immigration laws.\par \par \uc2 The core of the government's case is that federal immigration law trumps state law -- an issue known as "pre-emption" in legal circles. In her ruling, Bolton pointed out five portions of the law where she believed the federal government would likely succeed on its claims.\par \par \uc2 Justice Department spokeswoman Hannah August said the agency understands the frustration of Arizona residents with the immigration system, but added that a patchwork of state and local policies would seriously disrupt federal immigration enforcement.\par \par \uc2 Federal authorities have argued that letting the Arizona law stand would create a patchwork of immigration laws nationwide that would needlessly complicate foreign relations. They said the law is disrupting U.S. relations with Mexico and other countries.\par \par \uc2 About 100 protesters in Mexico City who had gathered in front of the U.S. Embassy broke into cheers when they learned of Bolton's ruling. They had been monitoring the news on a laptop computer.\par \par \uc2 "Migrants, hang on, the people are rising up!" they chanted.\par \par \uc2 Mexico's Foreign Secretary Patricia Espinoza called the ruling "a first step in the right direction" and said staff at the five Mexican consulates in Arizona will work extra hours in coming weeks to educate migrants about the law.\par \par \uc2 "None of this is very surprising," said Kevin R. Johnson, an immigration expert and the law school dean at University of California at Davis. "This is all very much within the constitutional mainstream."\par \par \uc2 The federal government has exclusive powers over immigration to ensure a uniform national policy that aids in commerce and relations with other countries, Johnson said.\par \par \uc2 A century ago, differing policies among states led to problems that prompted the federal government to adopt a comprehensive immigration policy for the country, Johnson said.\par \par \uc2 Supporters took solace that the judge kept portions of the law intact, including a section that bars local governments from limiting enforcement of federal immigration laws. Those jurisdictions are commonly known as "sanctuary cities."\par \par \uc2 "Striking down these sanctuary city policies has always been the No. 1 priority," said Republican Sen. Russell Pearce, the law's chief author.\par \par \uc2 The remaining provisions, many of them revisions to an Arizona immigration statute, will take effect at 12:01 a.m. Thursday.\par \par \uc2 The state can appeal Bolton's ruling to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco. Whatever way that court rules, Bolton will eventually hold a trial and issue a final ruling.\par \par \uc2 Wednesday's decision was seen as a defeat for Brewer, who is running for another term in November and has seen her political fortunes rise because of the law's popularity among conservatives.\par \par \uc2 Her opponent, state Attorney General Terry Goddard, pounced.\par \par \uc2 "Jan Brewer played politics with immigration, and she lost," the Democrat said. "It is time to look beyond election-year grandstanding and begin to repair the damage to Arizona's image and economy."\par \par \uc2 Some residents in Phoenix agreed.\par \par \uc2 "A lot of people don't understand the connection between, 'Yes, we have a problem with illegal immigration' and 'We need immigration reform,' which is not just asking people for their papers," said Kimber Lanning, a 43-year-old Phoenix music store owner.\par \par \uc2 "It was never a solution to begin with."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writers Bob Christie, Paul Davenport and Michelle Price in Phoenix, Felicia Fonseca in Flagstaff, Ariz., and Olga R. Rodriguez in Mexico City contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 5\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100728e67s0007x\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

COOPER and MICHELLE PRICE   \par \uc2 Associated Press Writers\par \uc2 786 \uc2 words\par \uc2 27 July 2010\par 19:19\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2010.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHOENIX (AP) - The sheriff of Arizona's most populous county is making room in a vast outdoor jail and determined to round up illegal immigrants to fill it. Police from the U.S.-Mexico border to the Grand Canyon are getting last-minute training. And protests and marches are planned throughout Phoenix.\par \par \uc2 Arizona's new immigration law takes effect Thursday, creating a potentially volatile mix of police, illegal immigrants and thousands of activists, many planning to show up without identification as a show of solidarity.\par \par \uc2 At least one group plans to block access to federal offices, daring officers to ask them their immigration status.\par \par \uc2 "Our message for that day is: 'Don't comply, don't buy,'" said activist Liz Hourican, whose group, CodePink, plans to block the driveway for immigration offices in downtown Phoenix.\par \par \uc2 As both sides prepare, a federal judge is deciding whether to step in and block the law. It requires officers enforcing other laws to check a person's immigration status if they suspect the person is in the country illegally. It also bans illegal immigrants from soliciting work in a public place.\par \par \uc2 Police across the state scrambled on Tuesday to train officers, including on how to avoid racial profiling, and plan for a potential influx of detainees.\par \par \uc2 The hardest-line approach is expected in the Phoenix area, where Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio plans his 17th crime and immigration sweep. He plans to hold the sweep, regardless of any ruling by U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton.\par \par \uc2 Arpaio, known for his tough stance against illegal immigration, plans to send about 200 deputies and volunteers out, looking for traffic violators, people wanted on criminal warrants and others. He's used that tactic before to arrest dozens of people, many of them illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 "We don't wait. We just do it," he said. "If there's a new law out, we're going to enforce it."\par \par \uc2 He said that the space he made in the complex of military surplus tents can handle 100 people, and that he will find room for more if necessary.\par \par \uc2 Elsewhere in the state, police officials said they didn't expect any dramatic events. They were busy wrapping up training sessions this week, with some agencies saying that untrained officers will not be allowed on the streets.\par \par \uc2 Many of the state's 15,000 police officers have been watching a DVD released this month that signs that might indicate a person is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  are speaking poor English, looking nervous or traveling in an overcrowded vehicle. It warned that race and ethnicity do not.\par \par \uc2 Some agencies added extra materials, including a test, a role-playing exercise or a question-and-answer session with prosecutors.\par \par \uc2 Critics of the law among police chiefs remain, saying that the law is so vague that no amount of training could eliminate potential confusion.\par \par \uc2 "Am I going to sit here and say I think every officer has a clear understanding of the law when they leave the training?" Tucson Police Chief Roberto Villasenor said. "No, because I think the law is poorly constructed."\par \par \uc2 Arizona's law gives police two options to confirm whether a detainee is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Virginia Kice, a spokeswoman for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, declined to comment on preparations or the role federal authorities would play in enforcing the law, except to say ICE "focuses first on criminal aliens who pose a threat to our communities."\par \par \uc2 Arpaio vowed to arrest all illegal immigrants and make them spend time in his jail. Other police officials said they'd try to get the Border Patrol involved as often as possible to avoid the time and cost of booking the detainees into jail.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors are also preparing for a potential influx of cases. They are reminding officers that they are required to explain the circumstances of the original stop, why they suspected the person was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  and any comments made by the suspect.\par \par \uc2 A march from the state Capitol is planned at 4:30 a.m., followed by a prayer service, a rally outside Arpaio's office and later that afternoon a concert outside a Maricopa County jail, according to the Los Angeles-based National Day Laborer Organizing Network.\par \par \uc2 The protesters both from Arizona and elsewhere plan to show up without identification and hold peaceful rallies.\par \par \uc2 "It's defiance, to see if they want to come and arrest those people," said Pablo Alvarado, the executive director of the NDLON. "We dare them to come and ask."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writer Jacques Billeaud contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100727e67r002io\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 DENVER (AP) - The federal government is rapidly expanding a program to identify illegal immigrants using fingerprints from arrests, drawing opposition from local authorities and advocates who argue the initiative amounts to an excessive dragnet.\par \par \uc2 The program has gotten less attention than Arizona's new immigration law, but it may end up having a bigger impact because of its potential to round up and deport so many immigrants nationwide.\par \par \uc2 The San Francisco sheriff wanted nothing to do with the program, and the City Council in Washington, D.C., blocked use of the fingerprint plan in the nation's capital. Colorado is the latest to debate the program, called Secure Communities, and immigrant groups have begun to speak up, telling the governor in a letter last week that the initiative will make crime victims reluctant to cooperate with police "due to fear of being drawn into the immigration regime."\par \par \uc2 Under the program, the fingerprints of everyone who is booked into jail for any crime are run against FBI criminal history records and Department of Homeland Security immigration records to determine who is in the country illegally and whether they've been arrested previously. Most jurisdictions are not included in the program, but Immigration and Customs Enforcement has been expanding the initiative.\par \par \uc2 Since 2007, 467 jurisdictions in 26 states have joined. ICE has said it plans to have it in every jail in the country by 2013. Secure Communities is currently being phased into the places where the government sees as having the greatest need for it based on population estimates of illegal immigrants and crime statistics.\par \par \uc2 Since everyone arrested would be screened, the program could easily deport more people than Arizona's new law, said Sunita Patel, an attorney who filed a lawsuit in New York against the federal government on behalf of a group worried about the program. Patel said that because illegal immigrants could be referred to ICE at the point of arrest, even before a conviction, the program can create an incentive for profiling and create a pipeline to deport more people.\par \par \uc2 "It has the potential to revolutionize immigration enforcement," said Patel.\par \par \uc2 Patel filed the lawsuit on behalf of the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, which is concerned the program could soon come to New York. The lawsuit seeks, among other things, statistical information about who has been deported as a result of the program and what they were arrested for.\par \par \uc2 Supporters of the program argue it is helping identify dangerous criminals that would otherwise go undetected. Since Oct. 27, 2008 through the end of May, almost 2.6 million people have been screened with Secure Communities. Of those, almost 35,000 were identified as illegal immigrants previously arrested or convicted for the most serious crimes, including murder and rape, ICE said Thursday. More than 205,000 who were identified as illegal immigrants had arrest records for less serious crimes.\par \par \uc2 In Ohio, Butler County Sheriff Rick Jones praised the program, which was implemented in his jurisdiction earlier this month.\par \par \uc2 "It's really a heaven-sent for us," Jones said. He said the program helps solve the problem police often have of not knowing whether someone they arrested has a criminal history and is in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 "I don't want them in my community," Jones said. "I've got enough homegrown criminals here."\par \par \uc2 Carl Rusnok, an ICE spokesman, said Secure Communities is a way for law enforcement to identify illegal immigrants after their arrest at no additional cost to local jurisdictions. Jones agreed.\par \par \uc2 "We arrest these people anyway," he said. "All it does is help us deport people who shouldn't be here."\par \par \uc2 Rusnok said ICE created the program after Congress directed the agency to improve the way it identifies and deports illegal immigrants with criminal backgrounds. ICE has gotten $550 million for the program since 2008, Rusnok said.\par \par \uc2 Rusnok said the only place he knows of that has requested not to be a part of Secure Communities is San Francisco, which began the program June 8. Eileen Hirst, the chief of staff for San Francisco Sheriff Michael Hennessey, said it happened "without our input or approval."\par \par \uc2 Hirst said the sheriff thought Secure Communities cast too wide a net and worried that it would sweep up U.S. citizens and minor offenders, such as people who commit traffic infractions but miss their court hearings. Hirst also said the program goes against San Francisco's sanctuary city policy that calls for authorities to only report foreign-born suspects booked for felonies.\par \par \uc2 "Now, we're reporting every single individual who comes into our custody and gets fingerprinted," Hirst said.\par \par \uc2 California Attorney General Jerry Brown denied Hennessey's request to opt out. Brown said that prior to Secure Communities, illegal immigrants with criminal histories were often released before their status was discovered.\par \par \uc2 This month, Washington, D.C., police decided not to pursue the program because the City Council introduced a bill that would prohibit authorities from sharing arrest data with ICE out of concern for immigrants' civil rights. Matthew Bromeland, special assistant to the police chief, said police wanted the program and were talking with ICE about how address concerns from immigrant advocates before the bill forced them to halt negotiations.\par \par \uc2 Colorado officials became interested in the program after an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Guatemala with a long criminal record was accused of causing a car crash at a suburban Denver ice-cream shop, killing two women in a truck and a 3-year-old inside the store. Authorities say the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , Francis M. Hernandez, stayed off ICE's radar because he conned police with 12 aliases and two different dates of birth.\par \par \uc2 A task-force assembled after the crash recommended Secure Communities as a solution.\par \par \uc2 Evan Dreyer, a spokesman for Colorado Gov. Bill Ritter, said Ritter recognizes that other states have had issues with the program and he wants to take time to consider the concerns raised by immigrant rights groups before deciding "how or if to move forward."\par \par \uc2 The Colorado Immigrant Rights Coalition said in its letter to the governor that the Secure Communities is "inherently flawed and should not be implemented." CIRC said one of its main concerns is that in cases of domestic violence, where both parties may be taken into custody while authorities investigate a case, victims may feel reluctant to report a crime out of fear that their illegal status will be discovered.\par \par \uc2 ICE maintains that only suspects arrested for crimes -- and not the people reporting them -- will be screened for their legal status.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Online:\par \par \uc2 Secure Communities: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.ice.gov/secure--communities/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.ice.gov/secure--communities/}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100726e67q0024s\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc71}{\*\bkmkend toc71}\b \uc2 New Arizona law casts spotlight on state's years of anger over illegal immigration\b0\par\par\uc2 By JACQUES BILLEAUD and AMANDA LEE MYERS   \par \uc2 Associated Press Writers\par \uc2 1,494 \uc2 words\par \uc2 25 July 2010\par 16:54\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2010.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHOENIX (AP) - As the days tick down until the Arizona immigration law takes effect, the state stands as a monument to the anger over illegal immigration that is present in so many places.\par \par \uc2 The anger has been simmering for years, and erupted into a full-blown fury with the murder of a prominent rancher on the border earlier this year. The killing became a powerful rallying cry for immigration reform and the sweeping new law set to take effect Thursday, barring any last-minute legal action.\par \par \uc2 But it does not tell the whole story about how Arizona got to this point.\par \par \uc2 Turn on the evening news in Arizona and some report reflecting the state's battle with illegal immigration will likely flash across the screen.\par \par \uc2 A drop house crammed with illegal border-crossers smack in the middle of a suburban neighborhood. Traffic patrols and workplace raids that net the arrest of dozens of illegal immigrants, often in heavily Hispanic communities. Politicians speaking venomously about border violence and the leech of immigration costs on the state treasury.\par \par \uc2 Along the streets, Arizonans see day laborers near \uc2 Wal-Mart\uc2  and \uc2 Home Depot\uc2  parking lots, waiting for work. In some Phoenix-area neighborhoods, Spanish is so predominant both in spoken word and signage that residents complain they feel like they're in a foreign country.\par \par \uc2 Then rancher Robert Krentz was gunned down in March while checking water lines on his property near the border. Authorities believe -- but have never produced substantive proof -- that an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , likely a scout for drug smugglers, was to blame.\par \par \uc2 Almost immediately Krentz came to symbolize what's at stake with illegal immigration. Politicians quickly connected the dots, but everyday folks also spoke with anger and fear about the rancher's death.\par \par \uc2 "You can't ignore the damage and the costs to the taxpayers and the disrespect that comes with it and those who think they have a right to break our laws," says Russell Pearce, the fiery state senator who wrote Arizona's new immigration law.\par \par \uc2 Pearce, in fact, is the godfather of anti-illegal immigration sentiment in Arizona and author of many of the tough laws.\par \par \uc2 He regularly depicts illegal immigration as an "invasion." He can tick off the names of police officers killed or wounded by criminals in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 One of those names is that of his son, Maricopa County Sheriff's Deputy Sean Pearce, who survived a gunshot wound to the abdomen from an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  in 2004 while serving a search warrant in a homicide case.\par \par \uc2 That might explain Pearce's indefatigable effort against those entering the country illegally, but he says he held tough views before his son was shot. He insists that his frustration centers more broadly on the crime that immigrant smugglers bring into the country and the financial stress that illegal border-crossers put on communities.\par \par \uc2 Between 40 percent and 50 percent of all immigrant arrests each year on the U.S.-Mexico border are made in Arizona, according to the U.S. Border Patrol.\par \par \uc2 And the annual costs? About $600 million for educating illegal immigrants at K-12 schools, more than $120 million for jailing illegal immigrants convicted of state crimes and as much as $50 million that hospitals have to eat for treating illegal border-crossers, according to figures provided by Superintendent of Public Instruction Tom Horne, Gov. Jan Brewer's office and the Arizona Hospital and Healthcare Association.\par \par \uc2 At Copper Queen Community Hospital, 4 miles north of the border in Bisbee, the emergency room sees one or two illegal immigrants every shift. Dr. Daniel Roe, the emergency-room medical director, says many come in with broken bones from jumping the 15-foot-tall border fence, others suffer from walking for days in the desert with little to no water, and others have been involved in car accidents.\par \par \uc2 "It's very much part of our normal flow," he says. "But it demands resources. So it affects the operating budget."\par \par \uc2 Immigrant medical costs led the hospital to shutter a skilled nursing facility and its maternity ward several years ago, according to the hospital's top administrator.\par \par \uc2 John Leopard, who camped out with Minuteman Project volunteers during a 2005 patrol north of the border, says he's not as irritated by seeing day laborers lining street corners as he is the federal government's inactions and the Justice Department's lawsuit against Arizona's new immigration law.\par \par \uc2 The law requires police who are enforcing other laws to check a person's immigration status if officers reasonably suspect the person is in the country illegally. It also requires that people carry and produce their immigration papers, while making it a crime for illegal immigrants to solicit work in a public place.\par \par \uc2 "We have policies that are injurious to our well-being," says Leopard, a retired computer scientist whose housekeeper was in the country illegally before she was able to obtain U.S. citizenship.\par \par \uc2 Don Sorchych, editor and publisher of a small local newspaper called the Sonoran News, says over the past 20 years his quaint Phoenix-area town of Cave Creek has seen illegal immigrants set up "villages" made of scrap lumber and canvas.\par \par \uc2 "I think people confuse racial profiling and being a racist," Sorchych says. "I'm not saying you should, but if you could profile, you'd be right 95 percent of the time. They wear a certain uniform, certain shoes, gloves in their back pockets, clothes from Goodwill."\par \par \uc2 Sorchych got so fired up about illegal immigration that he took photos of people who picked up day laborers and published them.\par \par \uc2 "I am not so sure it's the media and politicians who are whipping this up as much as the public," said Rick Van Schoik, director of Arizona State University's North American Center for Transborder Studies. "In election years, people who tend toward either extreme want to find passions that their cause would win the election."\par \par \uc2 The immigration anger has led the state to pass at least seven laws cracking down on illegal immigration in as many years. Those laws made English the state's official language, denied bail to illegal immigrants charged with serious crimes and prohibited them from being awarded punitive damages in civil cases.\par \par \uc2 Opponents of the law say illegal immigrants are being scapegoated and wrongly characterized as freeloaders, pointing out that they pay sales taxes and put money into Social Security that they will never be able to take out.\par \par \uc2 They say the state's rapid growth over the last decade couldn't have happened without immigrant labor, that housing prices have been kept reasonable by those who did work that U.S. citizens wouldn't -- like roofing a new subdivision in Arizona's 110-degree summer heat.\par \par \uc2 As Joy Williams of Tucson sees it, immigrants add to the melting pot that is Arizona and are doing jobs Americans don't want.\par \par \uc2 Williams, who works as a research clerk in the Pima County Legal Defender's Office, is also angry -- but about what she says is the open racism she's seen and heard in recent months.\par \par \uc2 "What is so shocking is people can be so openly verbal about it now and not even flinch," she says.\par \par \uc2 Since Arizona passed its new immigration law, immigrant rights groups say Hispanics are seeing more open hostility.\par \par \uc2 Lydia Guzman, president of the Phoenix-based Hispanic civil rights group Somos America, says community members are reporting racial slurs like never before. She says she experienced it herself in May while waiting in line at a grocery store, when one woman looked at Guzman's cart and whispered to another, "I wonder how much this is going to cost us?'"\par \par \uc2 Another group, Puente, said its calls complaining of racial incidents have jumped from about two calls a week to five to six a week.\par \par \uc2 Lilia Ramos, a 46-year-old \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Acapulco, lodged a complaint with Puente against the Arizona Humane Society in a dispute involving a dog found on her daughter's property.\par \par \uc2 Ramos says that when she called the Humane Society to report that the dog didn't belong to her family, the woman on the other end of the line became angry when Ramos asked if she could speak to someone in Spanish.\par \par \uc2 "She said, 'There's no one. Are you an American citizen?'" Ramos said in Spanish. "I said no, and then she asked if I had a green card, and 'if you don't cooperate, we'll arrest you.' I was quiet and it really scared me."\par \par \uc2 Ramos wonders what her papers had to do with an animal seizure and feels the incident wouldn't have happened if not for Arizona's new law.\par \par \uc2 "I like the United States, but I don't like Arizona anymore," she says.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100725e67p002pj\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc73}{\*\bkmkend toc73}\b \uc2 Judge hears arguments over Ariz immigration law, feds seek to have measure put on hold\b0\par\par\uc2 By JACQUES BILLEAUD and PAUL DAVENPORT   \par \uc2 Associated Press Writers\par \uc2 908 \uc2 words\par \uc2 22 July 2010\par 19:43\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2010.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHOENIX (AP) - The Arizona immigration law came under new legal scrutiny in a packed courtroom Thursday as a federal judge considered whether the crackdown should take effect next week amid a flurry of legal challenges.\par \par \uc2 Judge Susan Bolton did not issue a ruling after two court hearings stemming from lawsuits brought against the law, which has reignited the national immigration debate.\par \par \uc2 The hearings drew considerable interest as Republican Gov. Jan Brewer and the Justice Department's top lawyer in Arizona both attended, along with dozens of spectators.\par \par \uc2 Seven opponents of the law were arrested after they sat in the middle of a busy thoroughfare outside the courthouse and unfurled a massive banner that said "We will not comply."\par \par \uc2 Bolton has been asked to block the law from taking effect as she hears several lawsuits that question the constitutionality of the measure.\par \par \uc2 Opponents say the law will lead to racial profiling and trample on the rights of the hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants in Arizona. Supporters say the law is a necessary response to combat the litany of problems brought on by illegal immigration and the federal government's inability to secure the border.\par \par \uc2 Bolton, an appointee of former President Bill Clinton, repeatedly questioned Justice Department attorney Edwin Kneedler to explain how specific provisions of the law intruded on federal authority as he had argued.\par \par \uc2 "Why can't Arizona be as inhospitable as they wish to people who have entered the United States illegally?" she said.\par \par \uc2 Without prodding from attorneys, the judge also pointed out to lawyers the everyday realities of Arizona's immigration woes, such as signs that the federal government erected in a wilderness area south of Phoenix that warns visitors about drug and immigrant traffickers passing through public lands.\par \par \uc2 She also noted the immigrant smuggling stash houses that are a fixture on the news in Arizona. "You can barely go a day without a location being found in Phoenix where there are numerous people being harbored," Bolton said.\par \par \uc2 Kneedler said the law's requirements that law enforcement check on people's immigration status set a mandatory policy that goes beyond what the federal government requires and would burden the federal agency that responds to immigration-status inquiries.\par \par \uc2 Attorney John Bouma, who represents Brewer, said the federal government wants to keep its authority while turning a blind eye to illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 "You can't catch them if you don't know about them. They don't want to know about them," he said.\par \par \uc2 Brewer said she's confident the state will prevail, adding that Bolton "certainly understands the dangers that Arizonans face in regards to harboring illegals."\par \par \uc2 During the morning hearing, Bolton told lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union that she's required to consider blocking only parts of the law, not the entire statute as they had requested.\par \par \uc2 ACLU attorney Omar Jadwat said the law's provisions are supposed to work together to achieve a goal of prodding illegal immigrants to leave the state. He called it unconstitutional and dangerous.\par \par \uc2 Most of the controversy about the law centers on provisions related to stops and arrests of people, new crimes related to illegal immigrants, and a requirement that immigrants carry and produce their immigration papers.\par \par \uc2 Other parts of the law getting little attention deal with impoundment of vehicles and sanctions against employment of illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Bouma told Bolton that those challenging the law haven't demonstrated that anyone would suffer actual harm if it takes effect, and that facts -- not conjecture -- must be shown.\par \par \uc2 "In Arizona we have a tremendous Hispanic heritage. To think that everybody that's Hispanic is going to be stopped and questioned ... defies reality," Bouma said. "All this hypothetical that we're going to go out and arrest everybody that's Hispanic, look around. That's impossible."\par \par \uc2 Defendants include various county officials from throughout the state, most of whom sent lawyers to the hearing. Cochise County Sheriff Larry Dever was there in person, sitting at the front of the courtroom.\par \par \uc2 Dever's county is on the Arizona-Mexico border and he knew a rancher who was killed in March on his sprawling border property by a suspected \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , possibly a scout for drug smugglers.\par \par \uc2 The killing of Robert Krentz in many ways set the stage for the new Arizona law to pass, with politicians calling for action amid border violence.\par \par \uc2 Before the hearings, opponents gathered in prayer and carried paper doves attached to plants representing olive branches, a symbol of peace.\par \par \uc2 The law requires officers, while enforcing other laws, to check a person's immigration status if there's a reasonable suspicion that the person is here illegally. It also bans people from blocking traffic when they seek or offer day-labor services on streets and prohibits illegal immigrants from soliciting work in public places.\par \par \uc2 Since Brewer signed the measure into law in April, it has inspired rallies in Arizona and elsewhere by advocates on both sides of the immigration debate. Some opponents have advocated a tourism boycott of Arizona.\par \par \uc2 It also led an unknown number of illegal immigrants to leave Arizona for other U.S. states or their home countries and prompted seven challenges by the Justice Department, civil rights groups, two Arizona police officers, a Latino clergy group and a researcher from Washington.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100722e67m0010z\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 FREMONT, Neb. (AP) - The two lawsuits filed Wednesday against a small Nebraska city for its ban on hiring and renting to illegal immigrants worried some in the community that it would only worsen tensions over the new ordinance.\par \par \uc2 The American Civil Liberties Union and the Mexican American Legal Defense & Educational Fund, also known as MALDEF, filed lawsuits against Fremont, saying the voter-approved ordinance amounted to discrimination.\par \par \uc2 "I'm so disappointed that a law like this could have passed here. I always thought in this day and age laws are meant to prevent discrimination, not encourage it," said Mario Martinez, a Mexican American who lives in Fremont with his wife and young child.\par \par \uc2 The ordinance has divided much of the town.

Both lawsuits filed Wednesday may not quell the debate, but the civil-rights groups hope they will end the ban.\par \par \uc2 "This law encourages discrimination and racial profiling against Latinos and others who appear to be foreign-born, including U.S. citizens," said Amy Miller, legal director of ACLU Nebraska. "We're going to do all we can to make sure this extreme law, which would lead to individuals losing housing and jobs because of their appearance and language ability, never goes into effect."\par \par \uc2 Fremont City Attorney Dean Skokan said early Wednesday he couldn't comment on the lawsuits because he hadn't seen them. He did not return later telephone calls. Officials, though, anticipated challenges to the ban.\par \par \uc2 "We expect a minimum of about three lawsuits," Skokan said. He did not elaborate.\par \par \uc2 The ordinance is to go into effect July 29. It put Fremont on the list with Arizona and other cities in the national debate over immigration regulations. Arizona's sweeping law also takes effect July 29 and requires police who stop people suspected of violating a law to check the immigration status of anyone they think is in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 Fremont's ban worries Martinez.\par \par \uc2 At one time the city was a nice place, he said, but he's noticed more hostility toward Latinos in the past dozen years. And recently, it's gotten worse.\par \par \uc2 "Fremont feels like a completely different town now," Martinez said. "I'm as much a part of this community as anyone, but now I get hostile looks from people like they want me to get out, and my wife has been told to go back to Mexico because of her accent."\par \par \uc2 The ban requires employers in the city to use the federal E-Verify database to ensure employees are allowed to work. It also requires potential renters to apply for a license to rent. The application process will force Fremont officials to check whether the renters are in the country legally. If they are found to be illegal, they will not be issued a rent license.\par \par \uc2 Both lawsuits charge that Fremont's law is at odds with the constitutional mandate imposing a uniform federal immigration enforcement system. The lawsuits also contend the ordinance violates the federal Fair Housing Act and the equal protection and due process clauses of the U.S. Constitution, among other things.\par \par \uc2 "The Fremont ordinance is so vague, they actually are talking about people like me," said Shirley Mora James of Lincoln, the attorney who filed the MALDEF lawsuit and is a third-generation Mexican American. "If I want to live in Fremont, and I want to rent, I will have to prove my citizenship. I believe that's a violation of my civil rights. I don't think after two generations in this country that I have to prove I am a U.S. citizen."\par \par \uc2 Fremont, which lies about 35 miles northwest of Omaha, has seen its Hispanic population surge in the past two decades, largely due to the jobs available at the Fremont Beef and Hormel plants, which are just outside of city limits. Both plants say they already use the E-Verify system.\par \par \uc2 Hormel officials have said there have been no federal immigration investigations at the Fremont plant. In March, federal authorities indicted more than a dozen people on immigration violations after an investigation at the Fremont Beef plant. Fremont Beef did not immediately return a message left Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 Communities that have passed laws like Fremont's have struggled to enforce them because of legal challenges and faced expensive legal bills. Hazleton, Pa., passed an ordinance in 2006 to fine landlords who rent to illegal immigrants and deny permits to businesses hiring them. The Dallas suburb of Farmers Branch also has tried for years to enforce a ban on landlords renting to illegal immigrants. Federal judges struck down both ordinances, but both are on appeal.\par \par \uc2 Fremont officials have been watching those towns and others that have passed similar bans. City officials have estimated that Fremont's costs of implementing the ordinance -- including the legal fees, employee overtime and improved computer software -- will average $1 million a year.\par \par \uc2 Ken Ewald, 62, is white and has lived in Fremont for three decades. He said he doesn't understand why the city is getting such a hard time and that the federal government is failing to enforce immigration laws, so the city is stepping up.\par \par \uc2 "The law is the law," he said. "There shouldn't be a fight about it."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100722e67m000a9\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

"If I want to live in Fremont, and I want to rent, I will have to prove my citizenship. I believe that's a violation of my civil rights. I don't think after two generations in this country that I have to prove I am a U.S. citizen."\par \par \uc2 Fremont, which lies about 35 miles northwest of Omaha, has seen its Hispanic population surge in the past two decades, largely due to the jobs available at the Fremont Beef and Hormel plants, which are just outside of city limits. Both plants say they already use the E-Verify system.\par \par \uc2 Hormel officials have said there have been no federal immigration investigations at the Fremont plant. In March, federal authorities indicted more than a dozen people on immigration violations after an investigation at the Fremont Beef plant. Fremont Beef did not immediately return a message left Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 Communities that have passed laws like Fremont's have struggled to enforce them because of legal challenges and faced expensive legal bills. Hazleton, Pa., passed an ordinance in 2006 to fine landlords who rent to illegal immigrants and deny permits to businesses hiring them. The Dallas suburb of Farmers Branch also has tried for years to enforce a ban on landlords renting to illegal immigrants. Federal judges struck down both ordinances, but both are on appeal.\par \par \uc2 Fremont officials have been watching those towns and others that have passed similar bans. City officials have estimated that Fremont's costs of implementing the ordinance -- including the legal fees, employee overtime and improved computer software -- will average $1 million a year.\par \par \uc2 Ken Ewald, 62, is white and has lived in Fremont for three decades. He said he doesn't understand why the city is getting such a hard time and that the federal government is failing to enforce immigration laws, so the city is stepping up.\par \par \uc2 "The law is the law," he said. "There shouldn't be a fight about it."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100721e67l001r1\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.    \par \par \uc2 SAN DIEGO (AP) - An attorney for a Mexican man who died after being shocked with a stun gun by a U.S. Customs and Border Protection officer said Monday the sequence of events described in an autopsy report bolsters his case that the officer used excessive force.\par \par \uc2 The autopsy released Friday confirmed preliminary findings that Anastasio Hernandez died of a heart attack, with a heart condition and methamphetamine use listed as contributing factors.\par \par \uc2 It offered the most detailed account yet of how the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  died May 29, a day after agents were returning him to Tijuana, Mexico, at San Diego's San Ysidro border crossing.\par \par \uc2 The report by the San Diego County medical examiner's office said Hernandez, 42, became unresponsive shortly after he was shot by the Taser, apparently three or four times. He had Taser marks on his right side and left buttock, the report said.\par \par \uc2 "It appears to me that the use of the Taser caused the heart attack, which caused him to stop breathing," said Eugene Iredale, an attorney for the Hernandez family.\par \par \uc2 Dr. Zeev Kain, chairman of the anesthesiology and perioperative care department at University of California, Irvine School of Medicine, questioned why the officer shot Hernandez three or four times but said there was no doubt that methamphetamine use -- and apparently related heart and liver problems -- played a part in the death.\par \par \uc2 Hernandez had 0.16 milligrams of methamphetamine per liter of blood, which the autopsy characterized as acute. He also had an enlarged heart and fatty liver, which, according to Kain, suggest methamphetamine use.\par \par \uc2 "It's not that straightforward a case," said Kain, who reviewed the report at the request of The Associated Press.\par \par \uc2 Iredale, the Hernandez family attorney, characterized the methamphetamine levels as "relatively small."\par \par \uc2 The coroner has ruled the death a homicide.\par \par \uc2 The report said Hernandez was "agitated and confrontational" after he was detained by Border Patrol agents crossing the border illegally and became "suddenly violent" when his handcuffs were removed at the border crossing.\par \par \uc2 The report does not say if Hernandez was handcuffed and face down when he was shot, as Iredale says one witness has described. Each shot, Iredale said, would have paralyzed him for several seconds.\par \par \uc2 "I don't understand why, if he was handcuffed and face down, there would be a need for any Taser at all," he said.\par \par \uc2 Customs and Border Protection declined to comment on the autopsy findings, saying a thorough investigation should be done before any conclusions are reached.\par \par \uc2 San Diego police have finished its investigation and will share the results with federal prosecutors, who will decide whether to pursue criminal charges, Lt. Kevin Rooney said last week.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100720e67k0003k\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc79}{\*\bkmkend toc79}\b \uc2 Arizona and RI immigration measures similar in spirit but separated by key differences\b0\par\par\uc2 By ERIC TUCKER   \par \uc2 Associated Press Writer\par \uc2 917 \uc2 words\par \uc2 19 July 2010\par 20:34\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2010.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) - Supporters of Arizona's new illegal-immigration law have in recent weeks cited Rhode Island as a state where police have been quietly carrying out comparably tough enforcement without a court challenge from the Obama administration.\par \par \uc2 But in Rhode Island, both sides of the debate agree that the executive order issued by Gov. Don Carcieri in 2008 is far less sweeping than the Arizona law, which takes effect this month.\par \par \uc2 Comparisons of the two approaches are intended to rationalize the law in Arizona, generally more conservative than Rhode Island, by suggesting it's already more or less in place in a heavily Democratic state, said Steven Brown, a leading critic of the governor's order and executive director of the Rhode Island affiliate of the American Civil Liberties Union.\par \par \uc2 "The only reason I can see individuals focusing on Rhode Island is for political purposes and stretching what's happened here as a way to try and compare a largely Democratic state -- a blue state -- with a red state and somehow claim that Rhode Island should be looked at similarly," Brown said.\par \par \uc2 The Arizona law makes it a state crime for immigrants to not carry immigration documents; Rhode Island's executive order has no such provision.\par \par \uc2 Arizona's law generally requires local police officers, while enforcing other laws, to question a person's immigration status if there is a "reasonable suspicion" that the individual is in the country illegally. Rhode Island's order directs the State Police to help with immigration enforcement and encourages -- but, importantly, does not require -- local police to seek a suspect's immigration status.\par \par \uc2 State troopers in Rhode Island routinely check the immigration status of crime suspects, as well as people pulled over for traffic violations, if they have reasonable suspicion and will alert federal immigration authorities if they believe or can determine that someone is in the country illegally, said State Police Superintendent Brendan Doherty.\par \par \uc2 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement will then decide whether the person should be immediately taken into custody or can be released pending a court appearance, Doherty said.\par \par \uc2 The ACLU has received complaints since the executive order from people who say they were unfairly pulled over or interrogated, Brown said, but such accusations can be hard to prove in court. A Boston-based federal appeals court this year upheld a Rhode Island trooper's decision during a 2006 traffic stop to seek immigration documents from passengers in a van carrying about a dozen Guatemalans who mostly admitted to being in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 Commentators on blogs and television have seized this month on the State Police protocol to draw parallels to the Arizona law, asking why Rhode Island has not received attention for similar immigration enforcement.\par \par \uc2 In a July 7 post on the National Review website titled "United States v. Arizona -- How 'Bout United States v. Rhode Island?", commentator Andrew McCarthy, a former federal prosecutor in New York, asked why the Obama administration had not already sued Rhode Island for "carrying out the procedures at issue in the Arizona immigration statute."\par \par \uc2 William Jacobson, an associate clinical law professor at Cornell University, wrote this month on his blog, Legal Insurrection, that "Arizona is the new Rhode Island" and said it was ironic that strict enforcement practices would be carried out in the "state of Sheldon Whitehouse," a Democratic senator.\par \par \uc2 And an Internet post this month by columnist and blogger Ed Morrissey said Rhode Island has been doing for years what Arizona now wants to do -- but "without a peep" from the U.S. Department of Justice.\par \par \uc2 But those comparisons don't mention that local police in Rhode Island are under no legal obligation to determine a suspect's immigration status and that some specifically choose not to. That distinction is critical because city and town police officers are directly responsible for investigating neighborhood crime and would presumably have greater opportunity to encounter illegal immigrants than state troopers.\par \par \uc2 In Providence, home to the state's largest police department, officers wary of rupturing community ties or scaring off potential witnesses generally will not check a suspect's immigration status or involve U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement unless a search for criminal history or outstanding warrants reveals the individual is wanted for an immigration violation, said Police Chief Dean Esserman.\par \par \uc2 "Our focus is public safety and crime and building trust in the community for people to come forward and speak to us," Esserman said. "We do not take the role of the federal immigration authorities."\par \par \uc2 The Justice Department did not return an e-mail seeking comment Monday on whether it had considered challenging laws in states other than Arizona.\par \par \uc2 Carcieri imposed the executive order in March 2008, blaming illegal immigrants for using up state resources and, like Arizona officials, faulting the federal government for failing to control the problem. The Pew Hispanic Center has estimated Rhode Island's \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  population as between 20,000 and 40,000.\par \par \uc2 The executive order in Rhode Island, as well as Arizona's law, prompted an outcry from civil rights groups and immigrant advocates who feared it could lead to racial profiling. Some in Rhode Island who support the order say they don't think it goes far enough and prefer the Arizona law, which is the target of a Justice Department lawsuit and is set to take effect July 29.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100720e67k0002i\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc80}{\*\bkmkend toc80}\b \uc2 Arizona and RI immigration measures similar in spirit but separated by key differences\b0\par\par\uc2 By ERIC TUCKER   \par \uc2 Associated Press Writer\par \uc2 905 \uc2 words\par \uc2 19 July 2010\par 17:38\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2010.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) - Supporters of Arizona's new illegal immigration law have in recent weeks cited Rhode Island as a state where police have been quietly carrying out comparably tough enforcement without a court challenge from the Obama administration.\par \par \uc2 But in Rhode Island, both sides of the debate agree that the executive order issued by Gov. Don Carcieri in 2008 is far less sweeping than the Arizona law, which takes effect this month.\par \par \uc2 Comparisons of the two approaches are intended to rationalize the law in Arizona, generally more conservative than Rhode Island, by suggesting it's already more or less in place in a heavily Democratic state, said Steven Brown, a leading critic of the governor's order and executive director of the Rhode Island affiliate of the American Civil Liberties Union.\par \par \uc2 "The only reason I can see individuals focusing on Rhode Island is for political purposes and stretching what's happened here as a way to try and compare a largely Democratic state -- a blue state -- with a red state and somehow claim that Rhode Island should be looked at similarly," Brown said.\par \par \uc2 The Arizona law also makes it a state crime for immigrants to not carry immigration documents; Rhode Island's executive order has no such provision.\par \par \uc2 Arizona's law generally requires local police officers, while enforcing other laws, to question a person's immigration status if there is a "reasonable suspicion" that the individual is in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 Rhode Island's order directs the State Police to help with immigration enforcement and encourages -- but, importantly, does not require -- local police to seek a suspect's immigration status.\par \par \uc2 State troopers in Rhode Island routinely check the immigration status of crime suspects, as well as people pulled over for traffic violations, if they have reasonable suspicion and will alert federal immigration authorities if they believe or can determine that someone is in the country illegally, said State Police Superintendent Brendan Doherty.\par \par \uc2 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement will then decide whether the person should be immediately taken into custody or can be released pending a court hearing, Doherty said.\par \par \uc2 The ACLU has received complaints since the executive order from people who say they were unfairly pulled over or interrogated, Brown said, but such accusations can be hard to prove in court. A Boston-based federal appeals court this year upheld a Rhode Island trooper's decision during a 2006 traffic stop to seek immigration documents from passengers in a van carrying about a dozen Guatemalans who admitted to being in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 Commentators on blogs and television have seized this month on the State Police protocol to draw parallels to the Arizona law.\par \par \uc2 In a July 7 post on the National Review website titled "United States v. Arizona -- How 'Bout United States v. Rhode Island?", commentator Andrew McCarthy, a former federal prosecutor in New York, asked why the Obama administration had not already sued Rhode Island for "carrying out the procedures at issue in the Arizona immigration statute."\par \par \uc2 William Jacobson, an associate clinical law professor at Cornell University, wrote this month on his blog, Legal Insurrection, that "Arizona is the new Rhode Island" and said it was ironic that strict enforcement practices would be carried out in the "state of Sheldon Whitehouse," a Democratic senator.\par \par \uc2 And an Internet post this month by columnist and blogger Ed Morrissey said Rhode Island has been doing for years what Arizona now wants to do -- but "without a peep" from the U.S. Department of Justice.\par \par \uc2 But those comparisons don't mention that local police in Rhode Island are under no legal obligation to determine a suspect's immigration status and that some specifically choose not to. That distinction is critical because city and town police officers are directly responsible for investigating neighborhood crime and would presumably have greater opportunity to encounter illegal immigrants than state troopers.\par \par \uc2 In Providence, home to the state's largest police department, officers wary of rupturing community ties or scaring off potential witnesses generally will not check a suspect's immigration status or involve U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement unless a search for criminal history or outstanding warrants reveals the individual is wanted for an immigration violation.\par \par \uc2 "Our focus is public safety and crime and building trust in the community for people to come forward and speak to us," said Providence Police Chief Dean Esserman. "We do not take the role of the federal immigration authorities."\par \par \uc2 The Justice Department did not immediately return an e-mail seeking comment Monday on whether it had considered challenging laws in states other than Arizona.\par \par \uc2 Carcieri imposed the executive order in March 2008, blaming illegal immigrants for using up state resources and, like Arizona officials, faulting the federal government for failing to control the problem. The Pew Hispanic Center has estimated Rhode Island's \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  population as between 20,000 and 40,000.\par \par \uc2 The executive order in Rhode Island, as well as Arizona's law, prompted an outcry from civil rights groups and immigrant advocates who feared it could lead to racial profiling. Some in Rhode Island who support the order say they don't think it goes far enough and prefer the Arizona law, which is the target of a Justice Department lawsuit and is set to take effect July 29.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100719e67j002g4\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) - Four people who have served prison sentences with the man charged in federal intern Chandra Levy's slaying may be called to testify against him at his trial, prosecutors told a D.C. Superior Court judge on Friday.\par \par \uc2 But Assistant U.S. Attorney Fernando Campoamor told Judge Gerald Fisher that he did not want to reveal to the defense certain details about the witnesses until two weeks before the October trial. Campoamor cited safety concerns.\par \par \uc2 "We have reason to believe that witnesses have been threatened and intimidated," he said.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors have said they have notes or letters that they believe were written by defendant Ingmar Guandique (gwan-DEE'-kay) that contain threats to witnesses and admissions about Levy's slaying.\par \par \uc2 Guandique has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder and other counts filed in Levy's death. Levy vanished in 2001 after completing an internship with the U.S. Bureau of Prisons. Her body was found a year later in Rock Creek Park.\par \par \uc2 He also pleaded not guilty in December to additional charges that he threatened a witness in the case.\par \par \uc2 Defense attorneys said they need access to information about the potential witnesses much sooner than the prosecutors wish to divulge. They said they need to review the potential witnesses' criminal backgrounds, whether they have issues with honesty, have used aliases or have mental health issues that affect their ability to tell the truth.\par \par \uc2 "We're talking about going to courthouses all across the country," Guandique's attorney Santha Sonenberg said.\par \par \uc2 Judge Gerald Fisher agreed with the prosecution's timeline, saying they only need to provide the defense information, including whether the witnesses provided inconsistent statements, two weeks before trial.\par \par \uc2 Attorneys also began discussions with the judge about selecting a jury in the high-profile case that involves a defendant who is a Salvadoran \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Defense attorneys have expressed concerns about the under-representation of Latinos in juries. But Fisher said Friday that many factors, including a person's residency status, their citizenship and their ability to read and write in English, could result in a smaller proportion of Latinos serving on D.C. juries than those in the city's population.\par \par \uc2 According to the latest Census data, roughly 40 percent of D.C. residents are white, about 54 percent are black, 8.6 percent are Hispanic or Latino and 3.4 percent are Asian.\par \par \uc2 Fisher said he worries about finding jurors who are prepared to deal with the "hardship" of serving on a trial that's expected to last five to six weeks. He told attorneys Friday there likely will be a questionnaire for potential jurors that includes issues such as ethnicity, gang membership and exposure to pretrial publicity.\par \par \uc2 Guandique has been serving a 10-year prison sentence for separate attacks in the same park around the same time as Levy's disappearance and where her remains were found.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100717e67h0003e\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) - They can't get citizenship or in-state tuition rates, so they're taking the next steps -- the Capitol and White House steps, that is.\par \par \uc2 A coalition of student immigrant advocacy groups in Massachusetts, Colorado and California on Wednesday launched a makeshift school in the nation's capital, reminiscent of the "teach-ins" of the 1960s, to encourage a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants through college enrollment.\par \par \uc2 The first class at "Dream University" -- a school with informal classes and volunteer professors and instructors from around the country -- was held Wednesday outside the White House, with more planned in the weeks ahead. Students don't get credit for the classes, but they're free.\par \par \uc2 The first class of about 27 students, several wearing white DREAM University T-shirts, gathered at Lafayette Park, across from the White House.\par \par \uc2 Cady Landa, a former Boston public schoolteacher, led the students in a discussion of a report recently released by the Migration Policy Institute, a Washington think tank.\par \par \uc2 "It's not only an education," Landa said about the protest classes, "it's turning around a terrible situation and making it a positive situation."\par \par \uc2 Pedro Perez, who is attending college in Wisconsin, said being in the country illegally forced him to turn down a private school scholarship. Because they are in the country illegally, the students can't work to pay their way through school.\par \par \uc2 "It's hard to go back to Mexico. It's like an unknown country to me. I've been here since I was 3," Perez said.\par \par \uc2 The classes could allow undocumented students who can't afford tuition rates in some states a chance to attend classes, said Carlos Saavedra, national coordinator for a Washington-based group called United We Dream.\par \par \uc2 The Dream University plan calls for students, regardless of immigration status, to attend classes of 20 in history, civil rights, science, music and other subjects taught by professors from Washington's Georgetown and American universities. The '60s "teach-ins" took a similar approach in mobilizing opposition to the Vietnam War.\par \par \uc2 Tom Shields, a doctoral student at Brandeis University in Waltham, Mass., said he and two of his colleagues also have agreed to teach classes soon, and organizers say more professors from elsewhere will join.\par \par \uc2 The idea for the school came about after the Massachusetts-based Student Immigrant Movement group held a 19-day around-the-clock vigil outside of the Massachusetts Statehouse to protest a measure that would have imposed greater restrictions on illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 That vigil drew support from activists around the state and ended after the amendment failed.\par \par \uc2 "We got really inspired by what happened in Massachusetts ... and how successful it was," Saavedra said. "We brainstorm that if we really wanted to make a point about education ... we needed to literally build a university in different parts of D.C."\par \par \uc2 Dream University also acts as a vigil of sorts to push a federal bill, known as the DREAM Act -- standing for Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors -- that could grant legal status to some immigrants who attend college or serve in the military.\par \par \uc2 On Tuesday, Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., chief sponsor of the bill, said it was "very unlikely" the DREAM Act would pass in Congress before the fall elections.\par \par \uc2 State laws vary on allowing illegal immigrants access to in-state tuition rates. California, Illinois, Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico, New York, Texas, Utah, Washington and Wisconsin allow it, but others, such as Massachusetts, require out-of-state rates -- something a number of \uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2  students say they can't afford.\par \par \uc2 Groups of students in Denver and Los Angeles have announced plans to attend Dream University. But among the most vocal student activists have been those in Massachusetts, which so far has sent 10 students.\par \par \uc2 "Another 55 are scheduled to leave July 21," said Jose Palma, 33, of the Student Immigrant Movement group.\par \par \uc2 Students nationwide have signed up for the classes and word is spreading through \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , Saavedra said.\par \par \uc2 The school even has a "financial aid adviser" and a "residential hall:\par \par \uc2 Renata Teodoro, 22, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  in Boston, said she was working with undocumented students in Oklahoma, North Carolina and Kansas to raise money so students could travel to Washington to attend classes.\par \par \uc2 Once students arrive, Teodoro said, they will be housed in tents set up along the Capitol grounds.\par \par \uc2 "This school sustains our momentum," said Teodoro. "We're not going to give up."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Contreras reported from Boston.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100715e67f000cv\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

Dick Durbin, D-Ill., chief sponsor of the bill, said it was "very unlikely" the DREAM Act would pass in Congress before the fall elections.\par \par \uc2 State laws vary on allowing illegal immigrants access to in-state tuition rates. California, Illinois, Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico, New York, Texas, Utah, Washington and Wisconsin allow it, but others, such as Massachusetts, require out-of-state rates -- something a number of \uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2  students say they can't afford.\par \par \uc2 Groups of students in Denver and Los Angeles have announced plans to attend Dream University. But among the most vocal student activists have been those in Massachusetts, which so far has sent 10 students.\par \par \uc2 "Another 55 are scheduled to leave July 21," said Jose Palma, 33, of the Student Immigrant Movement group.\par \par \uc2 Students nationwide have signed up for the classes and word is spreading through \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , Saavedra said.\par \par \uc2 The school even has a "financial aid adviser" and a "residential hall:\par \par \uc2 Renato Teodoro, 22, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  in Boston, said she was working with undocumented students in Oklahoma, North Carolina and Kansas to raise money so students could travel to Washington to attend classes.\par \par \uc2 Once students arrive, Teodoro said, they will be housed in tents set up along the Capitol grounds.\par \par \uc2 "This school sustains our momentum," said Teodoro. "We're not going to give up."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Contreras reported from Boston.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100714e67e001vp\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 DALLAS (AP) - Maria Elvia Ross was a Dallas County jail guard assigned to the sheriff department's respected quality assurance team, considered an elite unit within the jails. She also, allegedly, is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Now Ross, who resigned Tuesday, faces deportation and Dallas County officials say they are writing new policies to make sure there are periodic checks of the legal status of non-U.S. citizens working as jailers and deputies for the sheriff's department.\par \par \uc2 The policy change is in response to Ross' arrest Friday. The 34-year-old Irving resident was arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers on civil immigration violations. She was released the same day. A court hearing has not been scheduled.\par \par \uc2 No one answered the door at her home Tuesday, and The Associated Press could not find a current phone number.\par \par \uc2 Ross was deported from the United States in 1998, ICE spokesman Carl Rusnok said Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 But by 2001, Ross had a temporary work permit and was hired by the county, said Mattye Mauldin-Taylor, Dallas County's human resources director. That was two years before a rule took effect requiring deputies and jail guards to be U.S. citizens, according to a story Tuesday in The Dallas Morning News.\par \par \uc2 Ross provided the sheriff's department with documents showing she was eligible to work in the United States each year until 2005. No one checked for additional documentation in subsequent years, Mauldin-Taylor said.\par \par \uc2 "There's not really any follow-up once they produce the documentation" when applying for a job, Mauldin-Taylor said.\par \par \uc2 Ross' immigration status was discovered recently when she underwent a background check after applying to become a deputy sheriff, County Commissioner John Wiley Price said.\par \par \uc2 The county's human resources department is creating a rule to check the work eligibility of non-U.S. citizens every year, Mauldin-Taylor told the newspaper. Frequent work-eligibility checks now will be required by the sheriff's department as well, department spokeswoman Kim Leach said.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Information from: The Dallas Morning News, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.dallasnews.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.dallasnews.com}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100713e67d001gd\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - A federal appeals court ruling Monday created the possibility that Guatemalan women could qualify for political asylum in the U.S. because of the high female murder rate in the Central American country.\par \par \uc2 The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued a strongly worded ruling reversing the deportation orders of two immigration courts that such a claim applies too broadly. The San Francisco-based court ordered the immigration judges, who work in the U.S. Department of Justice, to reconsider granting asylum to Lesly Yajayra Perdomo, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  in her mid-30s who settled in Reno, Nev.\par \par \uc2 Most important, the court ordered the Board of Immigration to determine whether all Guatemalan women can qualify -- a decision that could open the door to similar claims from other countries such as El Salvador, Honduras and others with history of widespread gender abuse.\par \par \uc2 More than 3,800 Guatemalan women have been murdered since 2000 and fewer than 2 percent of the crimes have been solved, according to the Center for Gender and Refugee Studies at the University of California, San Francisco's law school.\par \par \uc2 "This is not a phenomena limited to Guatemala," said Karen Musalo, head of the center.\par \par \uc2 This is the first such case to reach this high in the United States' court system, which has grappled with determining gender-based claims for asylum, she said.\par \par \uc2 The timeline for resolving the issue is unclear because the courts aren't under any deadlines to act.\par \par \uc2 The U.S. Department of Justice said it received 3,250 asylum applications from Guatemalans in fiscal year 2009 and granted 155. Only natives of China and El Salvador made more asylum claims -- 9,336 and 3,458, respectively. The DOJ received a total of 39,279 applications and granted 10,186 asylum requests in the same period.\par \par \uc2 The DOJ doesn't keep track of the number of gender-based claims.\par \par \uc2 Advocates for Guatemalan refugees hailed the ruling as long overdue and a recognition of how violent and chaotic that country has become since a ruinous civil war in the 1990s.\par \par \uc2 "The problems in Guatemala are getting worse and not better," said Kelsey Alford-Jones of the Washington D.C.-based Guatemala Human Right Commission. "This will be a very important tool for women seeking to escape violence in Guatemala."\par \par \uc2 Alford-Jones said there are an estimated 1.5 million Guatemalans in the United States and that migration makes it one of the highest undocumented populations. Alford-Jones said it is unclear how many other Guatemalan woman have made similar asylum claims as Perdomo.\par \par \uc2 Perdomo followed her mother to the U.S. in 1991 when she was 15 and settled in Reno, where she graduated high school and found work in the health care industry.\par \par \uc2 In 2003, the Immigration and Naturalization Service began deportation proceedings and she applied for asylum the next year citing Guatemala's poor record of investigating and solving the hundreds of murders of women annually. The appeals court noted that the Board of Immigration, which rejected Perdomo's asylum petition, has never addressed whether gender itself could be the basis for an asylum claim.\par \par \uc2 Perdomo is single, fluent in English and graduated high school in Reno. She is a Medicaid account executive for a health care company in Reno and is an active member of a Pentecostal church, according to the court.\par \par \uc2 On Monday, the appeals court said past decisions suggest that women in Guatemala may qualify for asylum, which includes citizenship and is granted to those showing they were persecuted because of religion, political beliefs, race, nationality or membership in a particular social group.\par \par \uc2 Perdomo asked the court to include Guatemalan women as a "particular social group" eligible for asylum.\par \par \uc2 "While we have not held expressly that females, without other defining characteristics, constitute a particular social group, we have concluded that females, or young girls of a particular clan, met our definition of a particular social group," Judge Richard Paez wrote for the unanimous three-judge panel.\par \par \uc2 Unless there is an appeal, the case goes back to the Board of Immigration to determine if Perdomo should be granted asylum. Perdomo's attorney is optimistic that the board will adopt the appeals courts findings and expand asylum to Guatemalan women in the United States who prove a legitimate fear of murder.\par \par \uc2 "Sending these girls back is a death sentence," said Alan Hutchison, Perdomo's lawyer.\par \par \uc2 The Department of Justice didn't return a telephone call.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100712e67c002vf\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

BECK   \par \uc2 Associated Press Writer\par \uc2 683 \uc2 words\par \uc2 8 July 2010\par 17:12\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2010.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 FREMONT, Neb. (AP) - The Fremont City Council is set to vote next week on whether to approve election officials' certification of a measure approved by voters that would ban the hiring or renting of housing to illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 If the council approves the certification Tuesday night, the law could go into effect this summer -- but only if it survives a promised legal challenge by the American Civil Liberties Union.\par \par \uc2 Voters approved the measure June 21 by a 4-to-3 ratio, according to a report from Dodge County Clerk Fred Mytty attached to the council agenda released Thursday. Mytty certified the vote June 29.\par \par \uc2 With the vote, the community of 25,000 about 35 miles northwest of Omaha joined the national debate over immigration laws.\par \par \uc2 Supporters say the measure needs to compensate for what they see as lax federal enforcement in dealing with a surge of illegal immigrants in Fremont. Opponents contend it could fuel discrimination.\par \par \uc2 Discussion of the ordinance before the vote Tuesday is unlikely, said City Council President Scott Getzschman.\par \par \uc2 "I don't know that there's anything to discuss," he said. "All we can do is ratify and certify the information given to us by the voting board. They say the votes are what they are, and we certify them, and that's it."\par \par \uc2 While the council has discretion to vote against recognizing the certified vote, that "most certainly will not happen," Getzschman said.\par \par \uc2 "It'd be definitely a legal can of worms if we said no," he said.\par \par \uc2 Once approved by the council, the ordinance will be posted by the city clerk and will go into effect 15 days later, Getzschman said.\par \par \uc2 The Nebraska ACLU will try to ensure that doesn't happen. Amy Miller, the group's legal director, said the ACLU will file a lawsuit and an injunction to block enforcement of the ordinance before it can take effect.\par \par \uc2 "We don't want this law to be in effect for even one day," Miller said Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 The legal fight could drag on for years, as it has in Hazleton, Pa., which in 2006 became one of the first U.S. cities to pass an ordinance targeting illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 The Fremont measure, which requires city officials and employers to ensure job and housing applicants are in the country legally, was modeled after Hazleton's ordinance. But that law has been tied up in court and has never been enacted. A federal judge struck down the ordinance, but it is on appeal.\par \par \uc2 Fremont officials seem well aware of the potential price tag of such court battles, having distributed before the June vote a list of estimated legal costs that other towns have incurred in recent years over immigration ordinances. The list included about $5 million for Hazleton, more than $3 million for Farmers Branch, Texas, and close to $300,000 for Valley Park, Mo.\par \par \uc2 Officials have said Fremont is assuming the ordinance's costs -- which includes legal fees, employee overtime and improved computer software -- will average $1 million a year.\par \par \uc2 The ordinance requires people seeking to rent property to first apply for a $5 permit at City Hall. Those who declare they are U.S. citizens will have their application approved on the spot, without further questions or documents proving legal status. Those who say they aren't citizens will also immediately receive a permit, but will have their legal status checked. If that check doesn't show an applicant to be in the country legally, the applicant will have 60 days to determine status. If they fail to do so, police will give notice that the applicant has 45 days to leave the property.\par \par \uc2 Only new renters -- not current tenants -- are affected by the ordinance, and landlords who knowingly rent to an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  could be subject to a $100 fine.\par \par \uc2 The ordinance also requires employers to use the federal online E-Verify system that checks whether a person is permitted to work in the United States.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100708e678002p9\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc91}{\*\bkmkend toc91}\b \uc2 At heart of Arizona lawsuit: Should gov't deport all illegal immigrants or just criminals?\b0\par\par\uc2 By BOB CHRISTIE   \par \uc2 Associated Press Writer\par \uc2 894 \uc2 words\par \uc2 7 July 2010\par 21:22\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2010.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHOENIX (AP) - On paper, Arizona's controversial new immigration law is not that different from the federal version.\par \par \uc2 But the key difference is this: Arizona wants every \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  caught and deported. The federal government says treating all 11 million of the nation's illegal immigrants as criminals would overwhelm the system.\par \par \uc2 In its lawsuit challenging the Arizona law, the Justice Department says its policy is to focus on dangerous immigrants: gang members, drug traffickers, threats to national security. Otherwise law-abiding immigrants without documentation would largely be left alone.\par \par \uc2 Homeland Security officials say the government cannot possibly find, arrest and deport everyone who is here illegally. And trying to do so would also upset a balance crafted by Congress that takes into account humanitarian interests and foreign relations.\par \par \uc2 But proponents of the Arizona solution insist that's no reason not to try. And they say the state's toughest-in-the-nation law is a reasonable way to start.\par \par \uc2 "If it's really the case that they don't have enough resources to enforce the laws that Congress has passed, it would seem it's incumbent on them to go back to Congress and ask for more resources," said Steven Camarota, research director at the center for Immigration Studies, a group that favors stricter enforcement of immigration laws. "But since they don't do that, it sort of undermines the argument."\par \par \uc2 Arizona's new law is nearly identical to federal immigration law. At issue is how it is enforced. The federal government says the state law is unconstitutional because it usurps federal authority to protect U.S. borders and American citizens. Arizona counters that the federal government is not doing its job, which forces state officials to step in.\par \par \uc2 State lawmakers argue that the federal government already enlists local authorities to identify illegal immigrants who have been arrested for other crimes. The new law, they say, just extends that to police patrols.\par \par \uc2 The federal government says the law goes too far by making it a state crime to be in Arizona illegally and requiring police to question the immigration status of anyone they encounter who is believed to be undocumented.\par \par \uc2 The furor over the Arizona law is overblown, Camarota said Wednesday. It does not envision mass deportations or roundups, just a slow but steady pressure on illegal immigrants to leave Arizona -- either for their home countries or for another state.\par \par \uc2 The number of illegal immigrants in the country fell for the first time this decade in 2007, and dropped another 800,000 between 2008 and 2009, primarily due to the recession and increased enforcement efforts.\par \par \uc2 As of January 2009, an estimated 10.8 million people were in the country illegally, 1 million less than the 2007 peak, according to the Department of Homeland Security.\par \par \uc2 Deportations have been increasing, climbing from 185,944 in 2007 to 387,790 last year.\par \par \uc2 Many critics argue the federal government cannot selectively enforce immigration law, but it's common for law enforcement at all levels to prioritize. Small-time pot dealers do not receive the same level of investigation or prosecution as big-time heroin traffickers. The government has also tolerated medical marijuana in 14 states.\par \par \uc2 But Arizona's law has brought selective enforcement -- and the differences that exist even among police agencies -- into clearer focus.\par \par \uc2 Those differences are stark, even in the Phoenix metro area. Phoenix Police Chief Jack Harris says in an affidavit supporting the federal suit that he will probably have to move detectives focused on violent crime to street patrol because regular officers will be busy enforcing Arizona's new law.\par \par \uc2 But Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who has been at the forefront of the effort to empower local authorities to enforce immigration laws, routinely assigns deputies to crime sweeps where they target illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 The federal government is worried that other states will follow Arizona's lead, overwhelming federal agencies with non-criminal illegal immigrants who will cost the government millions to deport.\par \par \uc2 A March study by the liberal Center for American Progress estimated that deporting the entire illegal immigration population and securing the borders would cost $285 billion over five years.\par \par \uc2 In the government lawsuit, officials with Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection declared they will be forced to shift resources from major cases to minor ones if the law goes into effect as scheduled on July 29.\par \par \uc2 The government wants a federal judge hearing the lawsuit and five others filed over the law to grant an injunction blocking the measure from taking effect. At a hearing Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton said she intended to take whatever time is needed to make a sound legal decision, suggesting there's no guarantee she'll rule on a possible injunction before July 29.\par \par \uc2 The federal lawsuit focuses on a core constitutional concern -- balancing power between the states and the federal government. More specifically, the issue centers on the long-running "pre-emption" legal argument that says federal law trumps state law.\par \par \uc2 The government sidestepped concerns about the potential for racial profiling and civil rights violations most often raised by immigration advocates. Experts said those are weaker arguments that do not belong in a federal legal challenge.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100708e6780001k\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 In Cold War remix, accused spies readied for possible exchange in round of US-Russia intrigue\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. and Russian officials met secretively on two continents Wednesday in a likely prelude to one of the largest swaps of accused spies in decades, a Cold War remix showing the high-stakes race for covert intelligence between East and West endures in the new century.\par \par \uc2 Five suspects charged with spying in the U.S. were hurriedly ordered to New York, joining five others already behind bars there, after a Russian arms-control researcher convicted of spying for the West came out of the cold of his forlorn penal colony by the Arctic Circle and was transferred to Moscow.\par \par \uc2 Researcher Igor Sutyagin signed a confession even while continuing to assert his innocence, his brother said, describing that event as one in a series laying the groundwork for Russia to release him and others accused of espionage in exchange for members of an alleged spy ring broken in the U.S.\par \par \uc2 Officials in neither country would confirm a swap was in the works. But the machinations -- including a meeting in Washington between U.S. officials and the Russian ambassador -- had all the hallmarks as the two former Cold War antagonists moved to tamp down tensions stirred by the U.S. arrests.\par \par \uc2 The trade could be the largest since 25 prisoners in Poland and East Germany and four in the United States were exchanged in 1985, the convicted or accused spies leaving their captors on the Glienecke Bridge between East Germany and West Berlin in the waning years of the Soviet Bloc.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Obama uses recess appointment to put a new director in place for Medicare and Medicaid\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Barack Obama bypassed the Senate Wednesday and appointed Dr. Donald Berwick, a Harvard professor and patient care specialist, to run Medicare and Medicaid.\par \par \uc2 The decision to use a so-called recess appointment to install Berwick as administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services drew immediate fire from the GOP. Republicans have raised concerns about Berwick's views on rationing of care and other matters and said it was wrong for Obama to go around the normal Senate confirmation process. That view was echoed by a key Democratic committee chairman, although the recess appointment is a tool used by presidents of both parties.\par \par \uc2 Berwick has wide support in the medical community but some Democrats feared the GOP would use his confirmation hearings as an opportunity to reopen last year's divisive health care debate. Obama defended the decision to appoint Berwick and two other officials, one to a pension board and the other to a White House science post.\par \par \uc2 "It's unfortunate that at a time when our nation is facing enormous challenges, many in Congress have decided to delay critical nominations for political purposes," Obama said in a statement Wednesday. "These recess appointments will allow three extremely qualified candidates to get to work on behalf of the American people right away."\par \par \uc2 Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell accused Obama of trying to "arrogantly circumvent the American people" with Congress out of town for its annual July Fourth break. Berwick could serve through next year without Senate confirmation.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 More triple-digit heat brings misery to East; city dwellers try to survive the concrete jungle\par \par \uc2 NEW YORK (AP) -- It's blistering. Scorching. Steamy. Brutal. Baking. Torrid. Ovenlike. It's run-out-of-adjectives hot.\par \par \uc2 "A volcano -- that's what it feels like to me," said Wayne Reid, mopping his brow and swigging bottled water after walking three blocks to a New York subway station Wednesday morning. He was dressed for the heat -- already a sticky 90 degrees and headed into triple digits -- in shorts and a tank top, but it didn't matter.\par \par \uc2 "You could run butt-naked out there, and it would still be hot," he said.\par \par \uc2 Heat waves are more oppressive in big cities, because concrete, asphalt and steel absorb more solar energy during the day and are slow to release it after the sun goes down, offering people little relief at night.\par \par \uc2 In the nation's biggest city of them all, Wall Streeters are sweltering in business suits on subway platforms, senior citizens are schlepping to the grocery store on streets that seem like frying pans, and New Yorkers overall are handling it by doing what they do best: coping, with a little complaining thrown in.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Some Gulf beaches may look clean, but buried BP oil still sticks to toes, complicates cleanup\par \par \uc2 GULF SHORES, Ala. (AP) -- There's a dirty secret buried under Gulf of Mexico beaches after cleanup workers scrape away the oil washing ashore.\par \par \uc2 Walk to a seemingly pristine patch of sand, plop down in a chair and start digging with your bare feet, like everyone does at the beach. Chances are you'll walk away with gooey tar between your toes.\par \par \uc2 So far, cleanup workers hired by BP have skimmed only the surface, using shovels or sifting machines to remove oil. The company is planning a deeper cleaning program that could include washing or incinerating sand once the leak is stopped off the coast of Louisiana.\par \par \uc2 Some experts question whether it's better to just leave it alone and let nature run its course, in part because oil that weathers on beaches isn't considered as much of a health hazard as fresh crude. Some environmentalists and local officials fret about harm to the ecosystem and tourism.\par \par \uc2 "We have to have sand that is just as clean as it was before the spill," said Tony Kennon, the mayor of Orange Beach, a popular tourist stretch reaching to the Florida state line.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 At heart of Arizona lawsuit: Should gov't deport all illegal immigrants or just criminals?\par \par \uc2 PHOENIX (AP) -- On paper, Arizona's controversial new immigration law is not that different from the federal version.\par \par \uc2 But the key difference is this: Arizona wants every \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  caught and deported. The federal government says treating all 11 million of the nation's illegal immigrants as criminals would overwhelm the system.\par \par \uc2 In its lawsuit challenging the Arizona law, the Justice Department says its policy is to focus on dangerous immigrants: gang members, drug traffickers, threats to national security. Law-abiding immigrants without documentation would largely be left alone.\par \par \uc2 Homeland Security officials say the government cannot possibly find, arrest and deport everyone who is here illegally. And trying to do so would also upset a balance crafted by Congress that takes into account humanitarian interests and foreign relations.\par \par \uc2 But proponents of the Arizona solution insist that's no reason not to try. And they say the state's toughest-in-the-nation law is a reasonable way to start.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Barge hits tourist boat on Delaware River in Philadelphia; 2 unaccounted for, 35 rescued\par \par \uc2 PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A disabled sightseeing boat adrift in the Delaware River with at least 37 people aboard was struck by a barge and capsized Wednesday, spilling passengers into the water and leaving two people unaccounted for after a frantic rescue effort.\par \par \uc2 The amphibious "duck boat" had gone into the water just after 2:30 p.m. and suffered a mechanical problem and a small fire, officials said. It was struck about 10 minutes later, then sank.\par \par \uc2 Searchers were looking for a 16-year-old girl and a 20-year-old man believed to have been aboard the vessel, which has wheels and can travel seamlessly on land and water, police Lt. Frank Vanore said. Several people went to hospitals, but there were no immediate reports of serious injuries.\par \par \uc2 There were 35 passengers and two crew members aboard the boat, said Coast Guard Senior Chief Bud Holden. Coast Guard boats assisted by police and fire crews worked to rescue people from the water, he said. A spokeswoman for the duck boat company says 39 people were aboard, and the reason for the discrepancy wasn't clear.\par \par \uc2 Bystanders along the waterfront screamed as the barge hit the boat, said a security guard who was patrolling the waterfront.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Los Angeles police make arrest in decades-long 'Grim Sleeper' serial killings\par \par \uc2 LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Police charged a man Wednesday in the city's "Grim Sleeper" serial killings after decades of frustrated investigations into at least 11 slayings dating back 25 years, authorities said.\par \par \uc2 Lonnie Franklin Jr., 57, was charged with 10 counts of murder, one count of attempted murder and special circumstance allegations of multiple murders that could make him eligible for the death penalty if convicted, District Attorney Steve Cooley said.\par \par \uc2 "Today is a good day," Donnell Alexander, the brother of victim Monique Alexander, said as he watched police activity outside the South Los Angeles house where the arrest was made earlier in the day.\par \par \uc2 Detectives have spent years probing slayings between 1985 and 2007 in which the killer targeted young black women and one man. The attacker was dubbed the "Grim Sleeper" because he apparently took a 14-year hiatus from his crimes.\par \par \uc2 Dozens of police officials closed off a block around the 81st Street house where the arrest was made.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Scientists: In colonizing Europe, humans braved northern climes earlier than first thought\par \par \uc2 LONDON (AP) -- Ancient man ventured into northern Europe far earlier than previously thought, settling on England's east coast more than 800,000 years ago, scientists said.\par \par \uc2 It had been assumed that humans -- thought to have emerged from Africa around 1.75 million years ago -- kept mostly to relatively warm tropical forests, steppes and Mediterranean areas as they spread across Eurasia.\par \par \uc2 But the discovery of a collection of flint tools some 135 miles (220 kilometers) northeast of London shows that quite early on man braved colder climes.\par \par \uc2 "What we found really undermines traditional views about how humans spread and reacted to climate change," said Simon Parfitt, a University College London researcher. "It just shows how little we know about the movement out of Africa."\par \par \uc2 About 75 flint tools have been found at the site near Happisburgh, a seaside hamlet in Norfolk, Parfitt and colleagues report in Thursday's issue of the journal Nature.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Stocks leap after traders snap up banks, materials shares; Dow gains 275 to top 10,000\par \par \uc2 NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrials climbed back above 10,000 Wednesday after investors had second thoughts about the heavy selling in the stock market during the last two weeks.\par \par \uc2 Stocks soared and the Dow rose 275 points after a modest gain Tuesday. It was the market's first back-to-back advance since mid-June and the first close above psychological benchmark of 10,000 since June 28. But analysts warn that the buying doesn't mean that investors are more optimistic. They said there wasn't a single catalyst behind the move and that it looked like a case of investors scooping up stocks that had become cheaper after heavy losses. The Dow had fallen 7.3 percent over two weeks.\par \par \uc2 "It's just more of a reaction to a little bit too much negativity," said Marc Harris, co-head of global research for \uc2 RBC Capital Markets\uc2  in New York.\par \par \uc2 The Dow and broader indexes gained more than 2 percent. Trading volume was light, however, signaling that many skeptical investors were staying out of the market. Interest rates rose as some investors dumped Treasurys in favor of riskier assets like stocks.\par \par \uc2 Financial stocks rose on an upbeat profit forecast from \uc2 State Street Corp\uc2 . The stock gained 9.9 percent. Materials stocks rose after having logged steep drops over worries about the economy. Aluminum producer \uc2 Alcoa Inc\uc2 . climbed 3.3 percent, while \uc2 U.S. Steel\uc2  rose 5.7 percent.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Fiesta! Spain defeats Germany 1-0, advances to World Cup final against the Netherlands\par \par \uc2 DURBAN, South Africa (AP) -- Spain outplayed Germany yet again.\par \par \uc2 And now the Spanish have the biggest prize of all within their sights.\par \par \uc2 Spain will play for the World Cup title for the very first time, thanks to Carles Puyol's goal on a powerful header in the second half Wednesday night. The 1-0 victory over Germany was a repeat of the teams' meeting in the European Championship final two years ago, which gave Spain its first major title in 44 years.\par \par \uc2 "This is one of the greatest moments for Spain, for us to be in the final of the World Cup, it's history," said David Villa, who remains tied with the Netherlands Wesley Sneijder for tournament scoring leader at five goals. "And we want to make more history in the final."\par \par \uc2 Somebody will.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100707e67700110\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.

Five suspects charged with spying in the U.S. were hurriedly ordered to New York, joining five others already behind bars there, after a Russian arms-control researcher convicted of spying for the West came out of the cold of his forlorn penal colony by the Arctic Circle and was transferred to Moscow.\par \par \uc2 Obama bypasses Senate for new Medicare chief\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Barack Obama bypassed the Senate Wednesday and appointed Dr. Donald Berwick, a Harvard professor and patient care specialist, to run Medicare and Medicaid. The decision to use a so-called recess appointment to install Berwick as administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services drew immediate fire from the GOP. Republicans have raised concerns about Berwick's views on rationing of care and other matters and said it was wrong for Obama to go around the normal Senate confirmation process. That view was echoed by a key Democratic committee chairman, although the recess appointment is a tool used by presidents of both parties.\par \par \uc2 More triple-digit heat brings misery to the East\par \par \uc2 NEW YORK (AP) -- It's blistering. Scorching. Steamy. Brutal. Baking. Torrid. Ovenlike. It's run-out-of-adjectives hot. "A volcano -- that's what it feels like to me," said Wayne Reid, mopping his brow and swigging bottled water after walking three blocks to a New York subway station Wednesday morning. He was dressed for the heat -- already a sticky 90 degrees and headed into triple digits -- in shorts and a tank top, but it didn't matter. "You could run butt-naked out there and still be hot," he said.\par \par \uc2 Enviro groups stunned that govt ignoring 27K wells\par \par \uc2 Leading environmental groups and a U.S. senator on Wednesday called on the government to pay closer attention to more than 27,000 abandoned oil and gas wells in the Gulf of Mexico and take action to keep them from leaking even more crude into water already tainted by the massive BP spill. The calls for action follow an Associated Press investigation that found federal regulators do not typically inspect plugging of these offshore wells or monitor for leaks afterward. Yet tens of thousands of oil and gas wells are improperly plugged on land, and abandoned wells have sometimes leaked offshore too, state and federal regulators acknowledge.\par \par \uc2 Enforcement at heart of Ariz. immigration lawsuit\par \par \uc2 PHOENIX (AP) -- On paper, Arizona's controversial new immigration law is not that different from the federal version. But the key difference is this: Arizona wants every \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  caught and deported. The federal government says treating all 11 million of the nation's illegal immigrants as criminals would overwhelm the system.\par \par \uc2 Barge hits tourist duck boat in Philly; 2 missing\par \par \uc2 PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- An amphibious sightseeing boat that stalled in the Delaware River was knocked over by an oncoming barge Wednesday, spilling 37 people overboard and leaving two passengers unaccounted for after a frantic rescue effort. The six-wheeled "duck boat" had driven into the water just after 2:30 p.m. and suffered a mechanical problem and a small fire, officials said. It was struck about 10 minutes later by a barge used to transport sludge, then sank.\par \par \uc2 Arrest made in LA serial killing of 10 people\par \par \uc2 LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A former police mechanic suspected of killing 10 people and stumping detectives for more than two decades was finally arrested Wednesday after police used DNA from his son to track him down. Lonnie Franklin Jr., 57, was charged with 10 counts of murder, one count of attempted murder and special circumstance allegations of multiple murders that could make him eligible for the death penalty if convicted, District Attorney Steve Cooley said.\par \par \uc2 Solar-powered Swiss plane gets its day in the sun\par \par \uc2 GENEVA (AP) -- An experimental solar-powered plane whose Swiss makers hope someday to fly around the globe soared into uncharted territory Wednesday -- the cold, dark night. The team of adventurers and engineers behind the Solar Impulse project are already celebrating an aviation milestone for the longest solar flight after keeping the single-seat prototype aloft for almost 15 hours.\par \par \uc2 Cops: Man holds his mom hostage for not ironing\par \par \uc2 VILLA RICA, Ga. (AP) -- Authorities have charged a 29-year-old man with aggravated assault and false imprisonment after they allege he held his mother hostage for failing to iron his clothes. Carroll County Sheriff's Office Sgt. Marc Griffith said the man remained in jail Wednesday without bond. The unidentified woman was not harmed in the June 30 incident. Griffith said the man, who lives with his parents, wanted his mother to do some ironing because it was "woman's work." When she refused, authorities allege he pulled out a gun, and took his 51-year-old mother's keys and cellphones and refused to let her leave for at least six hours.\par \par \uc2 Spain beats Germany 1-0 in World Cup semifinal\par \par \uc2 DURBAN, South Africa (AP) -- They pressured Germany the entire match and peppered its goalkeeper so many times a score seemed inevitable.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHOENIX (AP) - On paper, Arizona's controversial new immigration law is not that different from the federal version.\par \par \uc2 But the key difference is this: Arizona wants every \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  caught and deported. The federal government says treating all 11 million of America's illegal immigrants as criminals would overwhelm the system.\par \par \uc2 In its lawsuit challenging the Arizona law, the Justice Department says its policy is to focus on dangerous immigrants: gang members, drug traffickers, threats to national security. Otherwise law-abiding immigrants without documentation would largely be left alone.\par \par \uc2 Federal Homeland Security officials say the government cannot possibly find, arrest and deport everyone who is in America illegally. And trying to do so would also upset a balance crafted by Congress that takes into account humanitarian interests and foreign relations.\par \par \uc2 But proponents of the Arizona solution insist that's no reason not to try. And they say the state's toughest-in-the-nation law is a reasonable way to start.\par \par \uc2 "If it's really the case that they don't have enough resources to enforce the laws that Congress has passed, it would seem it's incumbent on them to go back to Congress and ask for more resources," said Steven Camarota, research director at the center for Immigration Studies, a group that favors stricter enforcement of immigration laws. "But since they don't do that, it sort of undermines the argument."\par \par \uc2 Arizona's new law is nearly identical to federal immigration law. At issue is how it is enforced. The federal government says the state law is unconstitutional because it usurps federal authority to protect U.S. borders and American citizens. Arizona counters that the federal government is not doing its job, which forces state officials to step in.\par \par \uc2 State lawmakers argue that the federal government already enlists local authorities to identify illegal immigrants who have been arrested for other crimes. The new law, they say, just extends that to police patrols.\par \par \uc2 The federal government says the law goes too far by making it a state crime to be in Arizona illegally and requiring police to question the immigration status of anyone they encounter who is believed to be undocumented.\par \par \uc2 The furor over the Arizona law is overblown, Camarota said Wednesday. It does not envision mass deportations or roundups, just a slow but steady pressure on illegal immigrants to leave Arizona -- either for their home countries or for another state.\par \par \uc2 The number of illegal immigrants in America fell for the first time this decade in 2007, and dropped another 800,000 between 2008 and 2009, primarily due to the recession and increased enforcement efforts.\par \par \uc2 As of January 2009, an estimated 10.8 million people were in America illegally, 1 million less than the 2007 peak, according to the Department of Homeland Security.\par \par \uc2 Deportations have been increasing, climbing from 185,944 in 2007 to 387,790 last year.\par \par \uc2 Many critics argue the federal government cannot selectively enforce immigration law, but it is common for law enforcement at all levels to prioritize. Small-time pot dealers do not receive the same level of investigation or prosecution as big-time heroin traffickers. The government has also tolerated medical marijuana in 14 states.\par \par \uc2 But Arizona's law has brought selective enforcement -- and the differences that exist even among police agencies -- into clearer focus.\par \par \uc2 Those differences are stark, even in the Phoenix metro area. Phoenix Police Chief Jack Harris says in an affidavit supporting the federal suit that he will probably have to move detectives focused on violent crime to street patrol because regular officers will be busy enforcing Arizona's new law.\par \par \uc2 But Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who has been at the forefront of the effort to empower local authorities to enforce immigration laws, routinely assigns deputies to crime sweeps where they target illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 The federal government is worried that other U.S. states will follow Arizona's lead, overwhelming federal agencies with non-criminal illegal immigrants who will cost the government millions to deport.\par \par \uc2 A March study by the liberal Center for American Progress estimated that deporting the entire illegal immigration population and securing the borders would cost $285 billion over five years.\par \par \uc2 In the government lawsuit, officials with Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection declared they will be forced to shift resources from major cases to minor ones if the law goes into effect as scheduled on July 29.\par \par \uc2 The government wants a federal judge hearing the lawsuit and five others filed over the law to grant an injunction blocking the measure from taking effect. At a hearing Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton said she intended to take whatever time is needed to make a sound legal decision, suggesting there's no guarantee she'll rule on a possible injunction before July 29.\par \par \uc2 The federal lawsuit focuses on a core constitutional concern -- balancing power between the states and the federal government. More specifically, the issue centers on the long-running "pre-emption" legal argument that says federal law trumps state law.\par \par \uc2 The government sidestepped concerns about the potential for racial profiling and civil rights violations most often raised by immigration advocates. Experts said those are weaker arguments that do not belong in a federal legal challenge.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100707e6770000m\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc96}{\*\bkmkend toc96}\b \uc2 AZ cops expect scrutiny of immigration enforcement\b0\par\par\uc2 By JONATHAN J. COOPER   \par \uc2 Associated Press Writer\par \uc2 866 \uc2 words\par \uc2 2 July 2010\par 04:44\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2010.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHOENIX (AP) - A new training video is too superficial to teach Arizona police officers how to enforce the state's tough crackdown on illegal immigrants, a lawyer for officers trying to block the law said.\par \par \uc2 "I thought it would be more detailed. I thought it would be more thorough. I thought it would be more expansive," said Phoenix attorney Stephen Montoya.\par \par \uc2 In the video released Thursday, Arizona police officials warned officers not to use race or ethnicity when enforcing the state's new toughest-in-the-nation immigration law, saying "the whole country is watching."\par \par \uc2 But officers were told they are allowed to consider if a person speaks poor English, looks nervous or is traveling in an overcrowded vehicle. They can even take into account whether someone is wearing several layers of clothing in a hot climate, or hanging out in an area where illegal immigrants are known to look for work.\par \par \uc2 Police officials cautioned that opponents of the law may secretly videotape police making traffic stops, trying to prove that they are racially profiling Hispanics.\par \par \uc2 "Nothing about the new law makes racial profiling acceptible," Gerald Richard, a special policy adviser at the Arizona Attorney General's Office, says in the video.\par \par \uc2 Law enforcement officials around the state said they were reviewing the training materials. Most hadn't decided yet how to use them.\par \par \uc2 "We feel this is serious enough that it needs to be a hands-on training, not just watching a video," said Yuma County Sheriff Ralph Ogden.\par \par \uc2 Arizona's law, sparked by anger over a surging population of illegal immigrants in the border state, generally requires officers enforcing another law -- like speeding or jaywalking -- to question a person's immigration status if there's a reasonable suspicion that the person is in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 Under the law, officers are also allowed to consider if a person does not have identification or tried to run away. But the stakes for making a mistake are high: Officers can be fired if they start asking questions because of a person's race, then lie about it later, the video warns.\par \par \uc2 "It is also clear that the actions of Arizona officers will never come under this level of scrutiny again," said Lyle Mann, executive director of the state agency that trains police. "Each and every one of you will now carry the reputation for the entire Arizona law enforcement community with you every day."\par \par \uc2 The law applies only to a traffic stop, a person who is detained or an arrest -- not when a person flags down an officer. Police are not required to ask crime victims or witnesses about their immigration status, and anyone who shows a valid Arizona driver's license is presumed to be in the country legally.\par \par \uc2 The law restricts the use of race, color or national origin as the basis for triggering immigration questions. But civil rights groups and some police officials argue that officers will still assume that illegal immigrants look Hispanic.\par \par \uc2 Arizona's 460,000 illegal immigrants are almost all Hispanic. Yet Arizona also has nearly 2 million Hispanics who are U.S. citizens or legal residents, about 30 percent of the state's population.\par \par \uc2 In the training video, an expert advises officers to ask themselves whether they would reach the same conclusion about a Hispanic person's immigration status if the subject were white or black.\par \par \uc2 To determine whether the person is legally in the United States, officers dealing with a suspected \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  are told to call the Border Patrol, a police officer certified to enforce immigration laws or a federal immigration hotline.\par \par \uc2 They are supposed to ask federal immigration authorities to come pick up illegal immigrants. If the feds refuse, officers can arrest immigrants or take them to a federal detention center.\par \par \uc2 The instructional video and supporting paperwork will be sent to all 170 Arizona police agencies.\par \par \uc2 Police departments will decide the best way to teach their forces. There is no requirement that all 15,000 Arizona police officers complete the training before the law takes effect July 29.\par \par \uc2 Gov. Jan Brewer ordered the Arizona Peace Officer Standards and Training Board to develop the training program when she signed the law April 23.\par \par \uc2 Opponents have challenged the measure as unconstitutional and have asked that a federal court block it from taking effect. U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton plans to hear arguments on the request later this month.\par \par \uc2 President Barack Obama on Thursday called the law an understandable byproduct of public frustration with the government's inability to tighten the immigration system. But he also said it is ill-conceived, divisive and would put undue pressure on local authorities.\par \par \uc2 The law was passed in part with the lobbying muscle of unions representing rank-and-file police officers who argued that they should be allowed to arrest illegal immigrants they come across.\par \par \uc2 It was opposed by police chiefs who worried it would be expensive to implement and would destroy the trust they have developed in Hispanic neighborhoods.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press video producer Yvonne Leow contributed.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Online\par \par \uc2 Training materials: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.azpost.gov/SB1070infocenter.htm"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.azpost.gov/SB1070infocenter.htm}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100702e6720000c\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHOENIX (AP) - Police enforcing Arizona's toughest-in-the-nation immigration law are allowed to consider if a person speaks poor English, looks nervous or is traveling in an overcrowded vehicle.\par \par \uc2 They can even take into account whether someone is wearing several layers of clothing in a hot climate, or hanging out in an area where illegal immigrants are known to look for work.\par \par \uc2 But top police officials issued a stern warning to officers Thursday, telling them in a training video not to consider race or ethnicity and emphasizing that "the entire country is watching."\par \par \uc2 The officials cautioned that opponents of the law may secretly videotape police making traffic stops in an effort to prove that they are racially profiling Hispanics.\par \par \uc2 "Without a doubt, we're going to be accused of racial profiling no matter what we do on this," Tucson Police Chief Roberto Villasenor tells officers on the video, which was posted online. The recording demonstrates how officers should determine when they can ask someone for proof they are in the country legally.\par \par \uc2 Arizona's law, sparked by anger over a surging population of illegal immigrants in the border state, generally requires officers enforcing another law -- like speeding or jaywalking -- to question a person's immigration status if there's a reasonable suspicion that the person is in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 Under the law, officers are also allowed to consider if a person does not have identification or tried to run away. But the stakes for making a mistake are high: Officers can be fired if they start asking questions because of a person's race, then lie about it later, the video warns.\par \par \uc2 "It is also clear that the actions of Arizona officers will never come under this level of scrutiny again," said Lyle Mann, executive director of the state agency that trains police. "Each and every one of you will now carry the reputation for the entire Arizona law enforcement community with you every day."\par \par \uc2 The law applies only to a traffic stop, a person who is detained or an arrest -- not when a person flags down an officer. Police are not required to ask crime victims or witnesses about their immigration status, and anyone who shows a valid Arizona driver's license is presumed to be in the country legally.\par \par \uc2 "The entire country is watching to see how Arizona and in particular Arizona law enforcement responds," Mann said.\par \par \uc2 The law restricts the use of race, color or national origin as the basis for triggering immigration questions. But civil rights groups and some police officials argue that officers will still assume that illegal immigrants look Hispanic.\par \par \uc2 Arizona's 460,000 illegal immigrants are almost all Hispanic. Yet Arizona also has nearly 2 million Hispanics who are U.S. citizens or legal residents, about 30 percent of the state's population.\par \par \uc2 In the training video, an expert advises officers to ask themselves whether they would reach the same conclusion about a Hispanic person's immigration status if the subject were white or black.\par \par \uc2 "If any officer goes into a situation with a previous mindset that one race or one ethnicity is not equal to another's, then they have no business being a law enforcement officer in this state," Arizona Police Association President Brian Livingston said in the video.\par \par \uc2 To determine whether the person is legally in the United States, officers dealing with a suspected \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  are told to call the Border Patrol, a police officer certified to enforce immigration laws or a federal immigration hotline.\par \par \uc2 They are supposed to ask federal immigration authorities to come pick up illegal immigrants. If the feds refuse, officers can arrest immigrants or take them to a federal detention center.\par \par \uc2 The instructional video and supporting paperwork will be sent to all 170 Arizona police agencies.\par \par \uc2 Police departments will decide the best way to teach their forces. There is no requirement that all 15,000 Arizona police officers complete the training before the law takes effect July 29.\par \par \uc2 Gov. Jan Brewer ordered the Arizona Peace Officer Standards and Training Board to develop the training program when she signed the law April 23.\par \par \uc2 Opponents have challenged the measure as unconstitutional and have asked that a federal court block it from taking effect. U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton plans to hear arguments on the request later this month.\par \par \uc2 President Barack Obama on Thursday called the law an understandable byproduct of public frustration with the government's inability to tighten the immigration system. But he also said it is ill-conceived, divisive and would put undue pressure on local authorities.\par \par \uc2 The law was passed in part with the lobbying muscle of unions representing rank-and-file police officers who argued that they should be allowed to arrest illegal immigrants they come across.\par \par \uc2 It was opposed by police chiefs who worried it would be expensive to implement and would destroy the trust they have developed in Hispanic neighborhoods.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Online\par \par \uc2 Training materials: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK
