The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) - Bowing to political pressure from Republican Gov. Susana Martinez, the House approved a proposal on Friday to stop New Mexico from granting driver's licenses to illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 The 42-28 vote by the House represented a victory for Martinez and a mostly Republican coalition in reviving legislation that had been bottled up by the Democratic-controlled House.\par \par \uc2 The bill goes to the Senate, where it faces difficulty. Senators rejected proposals last month to end the licensing policy implemented when Democrat Bill Richardson was governor.\par \par \uc2 The House-passed bill by Rep. Andy Nunez, a Hatch independent, will overturn a 2003 law that has allowed more than 80,000 driver's licenses to be issued to foreign nationals, including those living illegally in the country. State officials, however, say they don't know how many licenses went to illegal immigrants because people aren't asked for their immigration status when they apply for a license.\par \par \uc2 Eight Democrats joined with Nunez and the 33 Republicans in the House in supporting the legislation.\par \par \uc2 "Today the will of the people was heard in the House of Representatives," Martinez said in a statement. "I hope the Senate will also listen to the people of New Mexico and give this bill an up-or-down vote."\par \par \uc2 Martinez vowed during her gubernatorial campaign to repeal the licensing law and to cancel licenses already issued under its provisions. Nunez's bill, however, will not revoke existing licenses.\par \par \uc2 The legislation will prohibit the state from granting licenses to anyone living in the country illegally. However, it continues to allow foreign nationals in the country legally, such as students with visas, to get a license if they submit certain identification such as a passport.\par \par \uc2 Nunez and other supporters say public opinion polling has shown a majority of New Mexicans favor scrapping the state's license policy for illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 By issuing licenses, "we are sitting here aiding and abetting people that are breaking federal law," said Nunez, a conservative who switched his party affiliation from Democrat to independent earlier this year.\par \par \uc2 But House Majority Leader Ken Martinez, D-Grants, said polls shouldn't drive the Legislature's policy decisions. Many immigrants came to the U.S. legally, raised families and remained after the expiration of their immigration papers, he said.\par \par \uc2 "This is not a political issue and it's not an issue for campaign fodder. It's an issue to do the right thing for New Mexico. Let's make sure our roads are safe. Let's make sure people that drive on our roads are registered and let's make sure they are paying the insurance," said Martinez, the No. 2 Democratic leader.\par \par \uc2 Since taking office in January, the governor has pressured lawmakers to act on license legislation, rather than letting it languish in committees where proposals were bottled by Democrats and left to die when the session ends this month. She's used campaign money to pay for radio ads on the issue and legislators have been flooded with automated phone calls arranged by the GOP. The governor's staff videotaped Friday's debate in the House. The governor's website features footage from legislative hearings on issues advocated by her administration.\par \par \uc2 Several Democrats complained about the governor's tactics.\par \par \uc2 "The governor has stood up ... and waved her hands at the people and said, 'Let's take the driver's license away from this \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . We aren't taking licenses away from illegal immigrants. We're taking licenses away from foreign nationals," said Rep. Eliseo Alcon, D-Milan. "But they're using the words '\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 ' because this is the way that we can make the boogeyman sound bad."\par \par \uc2 The governor and her supporters contend it's a security risk to give driver's licenses to illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 But supporters of the policy say it's helped improve public safety, lessening fear among immigrants to cooperate with police in reporting crimes and has improved compliance with insurance requirements for motorists.\par \par \uc2 Rep. Miguel Garcia, D-Albuquerque, said he had received hateful messages over the legislation including one that described him as a traitor and said "we will not rest until you and your illegal friends are driven from our country."\par \par \uc2 "By denying driver's licenses to our foreign national immigrant community ... we give these fanatic extremists the upper hand in establishing the tone of our daily politics," said Garcia.\par \par \uc2 Maria Cristina Lopez of Somos Un Pueblo Unido, an immigrant rights group, said, "Legislators' refusal to even consider a 'compromise' bill that attempted to address specific concerns about fraud show that this debate isn't about sound public policy, it's about politics and re-election campaigns," she said.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110305e7350000s\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 McLEAN, Va. (AP) - An Immigration and Customs Enforcement report made public Friday concludes that new federal immigration policies would have prevented the release of an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who was subsequently charged with killing a nun in an alleged drunken driving accident.\par \par \uc2 Carlos Montano, 23, who arrived in the United States from Bolivia with his family as a 9-year-old boy, is awaiting trial in Prince William County for involuntary manslaughter. Authorities say he was drunk and caused the August 2010 crash that killed Denise Mosier, a Benedictine nun, and injured two other sisters.\par \par \uc2 The case fueled nationwide debate over the ICE bureau's immigration policy, especially in Prince William County, where immigration has become a flashpoint. Activists who support strict enforcement of immigration laws wanted to know why Montano hadn't been detained or deported for previous drunken-driving arrests in 2007 and 2008 and a reckless driving conviction earlier in 2010.\par \par \uc2 According to the report, federal policy at the time of Montano's first arrest was to avoid detaining illegal immigrants whenever possible because of a lack of existing beds.\par \par \uc2 Current policy calls for ICE to focus on detaining illegal immigrants with a criminal record who pose a threat to public safety.\par \par \uc2 "Under the priorities outlined in this memorandum, Montano likely would have been detained for three reasons, namely that he was: (1) a convict; (2) a repeat offender; and (3) a demonstrated danger to public safety," according to the report.\par \par \uc2 ICE says it has dramatically increased the number of beds dedicated to holding immigration detainees, especially in the Washington area, where 500 beds were added last year.\par \par \uc2 Still, ICE says it can't hold every \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  charged with a crime, even potentially dangerous crimes like drunken driving.\par \par \uc2 "Nationwide, however, ICE simply does not have the funding that would be required to detain all aliens charged with or convicted of DUI offenses," according to the report.\par \par \uc2 Prince William County officials and the conservative legal group Judicial watch had been waiting for months to see the ICE report. Each filed a lawsuit demanding access to the report after Freedom of Information Act requests were unsuccessful.\par \par \uc2 Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton said Friday he believes the publicly released report was scrubbed to remove passages that would prove embarrassing to the Obama administration.\par \par \uc2 "Most Americans expect illegal aliens to be caught and deported. To use the excuse that 'We don't have enough beds' is so pathetic," said Fitton, who accused the Obama administration has a "neverending supply of reasons" it won't detain illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 The report, though, indicates that ICE agents initially decided not to detain Montano in 2008, when George W. Bush was still president.\par \par \uc2 Fitton allowed that the Bush administration "has got some answering to do, too."\par \par \uc2 Calls seeking comment from ICE were not immediately returned Friday afternoon.\par \par \uc2 Prince William County Executive Corey Stewart, who has criticized what he perceives as lax federal immigration enforcement, said in a statement Friday night the report leaves many unanswered questions.\par \par \uc2 Stewart said the report "... indicates that ICE is, in fact, releasing dangerous criminal illegal aliens instead of deporting them."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110304e734002r0\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - Officials in a New Jersey county are urging the local community college to reconsider a recent decision to allow illegal immigrants to enroll as students and pay in-county tuition rates.\par \par \uc2 Morris County Freeholder Thomas Mastrangelo said Friday that the freeholders feel the money they give the County College of Morris -- which he says accounts for about 20 percent of the school's budget -- should only be used to subsidize tuition rates for students born in the United States or living in the U.S. legally.\par \par \uc2 "We're subsidizing it for citizens," Mastrangelo said. "Let's say you have a veteran coming back from Afghanistan or Iraq and they want to register for a class and that class is filled, and you have a percentage of undocumenteds in there, what do you tell the citizens?"\par \par \uc2 The college's board of trustees voted in February to overturn a policy that was passed in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and had barred illegal immigrants from taking classes. Starting in May with the summer semester, illegal immigrants will be allowed to enroll if they can prove they came to the United States before age 16, have been living in the U.S. for at least five years and graduated from a U.S. high school or with an equivalency diploma, among other criteria. Those who can prove residence in Morris County will be allowed to pay in-county tuition rates of about $130 per credit, compared to about $250 per credit for out-of-county residents and about $350 per credit for out-of-state students.\par \par \uc2 Mastrangelo, who is the freeholder liaison to the CCM board, said the freeholders may ask the college to at least rescind in-county rates for illegal immigrants. He said next week they plan to give the college a written proposal with suggestions on modifying its policy.\par \par \uc2 College officials would not comment further on the issue until they received a formal written proposal from the freeholders for consideration by the board, college spokeswoman Kathleen Brunet Eagan said.\par \par \uc2 The college's president, Edward Yaw, told the Daily Record newspaper of Parsippany at a meeting of school officials and freeholders Wednesday that the board still supported the position on which it had recently voted.\par \par \uc2 "It's the only position we have at this point," Yaw told the newspaper.\par \par \uc2 The issue of whether illegal immigrants should be allowed to enroll in post-secondary institutions is an ongoing debate at the federal and local levels across the United States.\par \par \uc2 Opponents say allowing illegal immigrants to enroll in college takes seats away from legal residents, usurps scarce resources and taxpayer money to subsidize the undocumented and encourages illegal immigration. Supporters, including many \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students, say those who are brought to the United States as children and work hard, grow up in the local school systems and graduate from U.S. high schools are faced with dead ends after their senior years -- regardless of how hard they work. They say getting a college education and entering the workforce would make them less of a burden on taxpayers.\par \par \uc2 Several of New Jersey's community colleges, and some private colleges, currently allow illegal immigrants to enroll or don't ask for immigration status on school applications.\par \par \uc2 The presidents of more than half the state's 19 community colleges, in consultation with their boards of trustees, in December signed a letter urging the state's congressional delegation to help pass the Dream Act, federal legislation that would have allowed immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally before the age of 16 the chance to legalize their statuses by completing at least two years of college or military service if they satisfied certain criteria.\par \par \uc2 The bill, which did not pass, also would have granted states the power to decide whether to allow students covered by the Dream Act to pay in-state tuition rates.\par \par \uc2 Mastrangelo said that since the Dream Act failed, and in the absence of any new federal legislation, he and the freeholders believe the issue shouldn't be decided at the local level.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110304e734002pr\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

(AP) -- A 12-year-old boy accused of killing his parents and wounding two of his younger siblings is a "good kid" who is active in his church, often volunteering to hand out bulletins, work audio and video equipment and help other children learn Bible verses, friends and relatives said.\par \par \uc2 The boy is suspected of fatally shooting his parents and wounding his 5-year-old sister and 9-year-old brother Tuesday evening at the family's home in Burlington, near the Kansas border.\par \par \uc2 Police say they discovered the attacks after the boy called 911 to report a shooting.\par \par \uc2 District attorney Robert Watson said Thursday he plans to file two counts of first-degree murder and other charges against the boy by the end of Friday. He hasn't decided whether to try to prosecute the boy as an adult.\par \par \uc2 Tom Ward, a public defender representing the boy, declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 News of Charles and Marilyn Long's deaths spread quickly through this rural community of 3,700, where residents held a vigil Wednesday night. Friends and family members said there were no signs of trouble at the Longs' home.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Kan. Hispanic population surges 59 pct. in decade\par \par \uc2 WICHITA, Kan. (AP) -- Kansas saw its Hispanic population surge over the past decade, according to census figures released Thursday, but advocates warned it will lose many of those new residents should the Legislature approve a tough illegal immigration crackdown they say has driven many legal U.S. citizens out of other states.\par \par \uc2 The local figures released by the U.S. Census Bureau show the number of Hispanics in Kansas surged by 59 percent since 2000 and now represents more than one in every 10 residents.\par \par \uc2 Sharon Spauth, a Hispanic resident of Wichita who moved with her family in 1970 from Colorado, said part of the reason Kansas has experienced so much growth is the economic downturn in other states. That has driven new immigrant workers to meatpacking plants in western Kansas, she said.\par \par \uc2 "When other states have a lack of prosperity, we have waves of (Hispanics) who come into Kansas," said Spauth, who works as a tax preparer.\par \par \uc2 The Kansas House is considering a bill that includes a provision similar to an Arizona law enacted last year that requires law enforcement officers to check the status of people they stop who are suspected of being illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 That, Spauth said, would halt the population growth among Latinos. Kansas had an influx of Hispanic residents come into the state when Oklahoma passed a restrictive law against illegal immigrants, she said three \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  families at her church moved in December from Arizona.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Census shows most Kansas counties losing residents\par \par \uc2 TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) -- Nearly three-quarters of Kansas' counties lost residents over the past decade, continuing a trend that has left dying towns in rural areas even as other regions see greater suburban sprawl, according to figures released Thursday by the U.S. Census Bureau.\par \par \uc2 Declining rural populations have become a compelling issue this year for new Gov. Sam Brownback and legislators. Brownback is pushing a plan to lure people from other states to struggling counties by promising that they won't have to pay individual income taxes for five years.\par \par \uc2 The census figures showed that 77 of the state's 105 counties had fewer residents in 2010 than in 2000, and 23 of the counties saw their populations drop by more than 10 percent.\par \par \uc2 Yet Kansas' overall population grew by 6 percent over the decade, allowing the state to avoid losing representation in Congress. The state's population exceeded 2.85 million, up nearly 165,000 from the 2000 figure of 2.69 million.\par \par \uc2 In the state's portion of the Kansas City metro area, Johnson County saw its population grow nearly 21 percent and had the census confirm its status as the state's most populous county. There's also a cluster of growing counties in the Wichita metropolitan area, and the counties around Fort Riley in northeast Kansas also saw significant growth, thanks to an expansion on the Army post.\par \par \uc2 "It's always good to see growth, but I'd like to see more balanced growth across more of the state," Brownback said in a statement.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Kansas district gets waiver from education law\par \par \uc2 School Superintendent Randy Watson has been flooded with phone calls from other school leaders since his central Kansas district received a waiver from the federal No Child Left Behind education law.\par \par \uc2 Forget state tests for sixth-graders through high-school students in the McPherson School District. They don't have to take them anymore to prove that the district is making annual progress toward having 100 percent of its students meet grade-level expectations by 2014.\par \par \uc2 Instead, the 2,400-student district will track student achievement for its older students with standardized tests developed by the same group that administers the ACT college entrance exams. The elementary students will continue to take state tests.\par \par \uc2 Watson said this week that the ACT-developed tests are more rigorous and do a better job of preparing students for college and careers -- the latest federal push. The change also means the district will be able to bypass the 100-percent goal with its older students, although they still will be required to show progress on the alternative exams.\par \par \uc2 The district petitioned the federal government for a waiver in September and learned last week that it had been granted. Since Monday, Watson has gotten calls from a couple dozen Kansas school districts congratulating him and asking him how he did it.\par \par \uc2 Kansas Department of Education spokeswoman Kathy Toelkes said it's the first waiver of its kind to be granted in the state. Watson said federal education officials told him it's the first of its kind nationally, but the U.S. Education Department wasn't immediately able to confirm that.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 SW Kan. officials may challenge census figures\par \par \uc2 GARDEN CITY, Kan. (AP) -- A Garden City official says the southwest Kansas community is likely to challenge new federal census figures showing its population declined by 1,800 people over the past decade.\par \par \uc2 Director of planning and development Kaleb Kentner says the figures released Thursday don't square with what local officials have seen.\par \par \uc2 The census report says Garden City's population declined 6 percent, from more than 28,000 people in 2000 to fewer than 27,000 last year.\par \par \uc2 But local officials believe the city's population exceeds 30,000.\par \par \uc2 They also doubt the census numbers on surrounding Finney County. The census says the county's population fell about 9 percent, from more than 40,000 in 2000 to fewer than 37,000 in 2010. Local officials believe the more accurate count is about 43,000.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Mo. House approves funeral protest restrictions\par \par \uc2 JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) -- The Missouri House pressed forward Thursday to put new restrictions on funeral protests, despite a U.S. Supreme Court ruling earlier this week affirming the First Amendment right of groups such as Westboro Baptist Church to hold demonstrations.\par \par \uc2 State lawmakers said they want to keep protesters away from funerals to protect mourners from intrusions and because of fears that violence could be directed at demonstrators.\par \par \uc2 The House voted 142-15 on Thursday to approve legislation that would make it a misdemeanor to protest within 500 feet of a cemetery, mortuary, church or other house of worship from two hours before a funeral to two hours after the ceremony. Violators would face up to six months in jail. The legislation also would make it easier for people to file lawsuits for the infliction of emotional distress against protesters who violate those restrictions.\par \par \uc2 That bill -- now moving to the state Senate -- comes after a federal judge declared last year that two Missouri funeral protest laws approved in 2006 were unconstitutional.\par \par \uc2 The legislative efforts are aimed at members of the Topeka, Kan.-based Westboro Baptist Church, who hold funeral demonstrations across the country while contending that the deaths are God's punishment for the nation's tolerance of homosexuality. Many of the protests have been at funerals for members of the military.\par \par \uc2 On Wednesday, the U.S. Supreme Court sided with Westboro and ended a lawsuit brought by Albert Snyder, who sued church members for the emotional pain caused by a demonstration at his son Matthew's funeral in Maryland. Chief Justice John Roberts said in his opinion for the court that the First Amendment protects "even hurtful speech on public issues to ensure that we do not stifle public debate."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Kan. businessman sentenced for not paying taxes\par \par \uc2 LEAWOOD, Kan. (AP) -- A Leawood man has been sentenced to more than three years in federal prison and ordered to pay $5.8 million in restitution for not paying employment taxes for workers at companies he owned.\par \par \uc2 The U.S. Attorney's office in Kansas announced Thursday that 41-year-old Jeffrey Phillips was sentenced to 3 1/2 years in federal prison.\par \par \uc2 He admitted last December that he had not paid employment taxes from 2001 to 2005. He said he withheld tax payments from workers' checks but did not make about $4 million in payments to the IRS.\par \par \uc2 Phillips owned JP Holdings, LLC, in Shawnee and a dozen other companies in Kansas and Missouri.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110304e734001i8\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WICHITA, Kan. (AP) - Kansas saw its Hispanic population surge over the past decade, according to census figures released Thursday, but advocates warned it will lose many of those new residents should the Legislature approve a tough illegal immigration crackdown they say has driven many legal U.S. citizens out of other states.\par \par \uc2 The local figures released by the U.S. Census Bureau show the number of Hispanics in Kansas surged by 59 percent since 2000 and now represents more than one in every 10 residents.\par \par \uc2 Sharon Spauth, a Hispanic resident of Wichita who moved with her family in 1970 from Colorado, said part of the reason Kansas has experienced so much growth is the economic downturn in other states. That has driven new immigrant workers to meatpacking plants in western Kansas, she said.\par \par \uc2 "When other states have a lack of prosperity, we have waves of (Hispanics) who come into Kansas," said Spauth, who works as a tax preparer.\par \par \uc2 The Kansas House is considering a bill that includes a provision similar to an Arizona law enacted last year that requires law enforcement officers to check the status of people they stop who are suspected of being illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 That, Spauth said, would halt the population growth among Latinos. Kansas had an influx of Hispanic residents come into the state when Oklahoma passed a restrictive law against illegal immigrants, she said three \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  families at her church moved in December from Arizona.\par \par \uc2 "Whenever you pass anti-immigrant legislation, even though you may have a green card, you are threatening the whole family," she said.\par \par \uc2 Figures provided to state officials and obtained by The Associated Press Thursday prior to their public release counted 300,042 Hispanic residents in 2010, representing 10.5 percent of the Kansas population. The 2000 Census found there were 188,252 Hispanic residents, 7 percent of the population.\par \par \uc2 The architects of this year's bill on illegal immigration, Secretary of State Kris Kobach and state Rep. Lance Kinzer, of Olathe, both Republicans, wouldn't speculate about whether part of the increase could be due to illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 "It's just really dicey to try to draw any conclusions in that regard from the census data itself," Kinzer said.\par \par \uc2 Among the new Kansas residents is Juan Alejandre, the 36-year-old owner of one of Wichita's Poblano Mexican Grill restaurants. He moved in 2002 from Colorado to Kansas, where he bought out his partner's share in the restaurant.\par \par \uc2 "The opportunity here is a little bit better than the big cities," Alejandre said. "The schools are better for the kids, and also the work that we have. We don't have very much competition versus the big places."\par \par \uc2 The state's total population grew about 6 percent over the decade, to 2.85 million residents, up about 165,000 from the 2000 figure of 2.69 million. But Kansas continued to see a decline in rural areas, with 77 of its 105 counties losing residents since 2000.\par \par \uc2 In the isolated counties that have seen population growth, much of that can be attributed to the increase in the Hispanic population.\par \par \uc2 For example, Crawford County in southeast Kansas saw an increase of 892 residents and an increase in the Hispanic population of 852. The count went from 910 Hispanic residents in 2000 to 1,762 in 2010, a 94 percent increase.\par \par \uc2 In Seward County, the total population increased by 442 residents, but the Hispanic population grew by 37 percent, from 9,486 in 2000 to 12,990 in 2010. Next door in Stevens, the county increased by 261 residents overall, while the Hispanic population grew by 57 percent, from 1,187 in 2000 to 1,866 in 2010.\par \par \uc2 The same trend holds true in Cowley, Ford, Gray, Hamilton, Pratt, and Saline counties.\par \par \uc2 Mario Lopez, a lifelong Hispanic resident of Garden City who runs an insurance agency, said many of the new immigrants are coming to western Kansas to take jobs at the meatpacking plants.\par \par \uc2 "We, along with the cities of Dodge City and Liberal, are pretty much the beef triangle of the world," Lopez said. "There is a lot of processing, cattle raising, things like that that go on in our community."\par \par \uc2 Emira Palacios, immigrant rights initiative coordinator at Sunflower Community Action in Wichita, said she moved to Wichita in 1985 because she had a couple of brothers that lived there. She became a naturalized citizen in 2005 and came to Kansas to "look for the American dream."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press Writer John Milburn in Topeka contributed to this report.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) - The Democratic-controlled House wrestled Friday with a politically charged proposal sought by Republican Gov. Susana Martinez to stop New Mexico from granting driver's licenses to illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Legislation by Rep. Andy Nunez, a Hatch independent, would prohibit the state from granting licenses to anyone without a Social Security number, which is unavailable to an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Nunez predicts a coalition of Democrats and Republicans will approve the bill Friday after debate that's expected to last for several hours. He and other supporters say public opinion polling has shown a majority of New Mexicans favor scrapping the license policy for illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 "I have over 70 percent of the people in my district and in my southern part of the state that want this bill," said Nunez, a conservative who switched his party affiliation from Democrat to independent earlier this year.\par \par \uc2 A 2003 law signed by former Democratic Gov. Bill Richardson has allowed more than 80,000 driver's licenses to be issued to foreign nationals, including those living illegally in the country. State officials, however, say they don't know how many licenses went to illegal immigrants because people aren't asked for their immigration status when they apply for a license.\par \par \uc2 Martinez vowed during her gubernatorial campaign to repeal the licensing law and to cancel licenses already issued under its provisions. Nunez's bill, however, will not revoke existing licenses.\par \par \uc2 Since taking office in January, Martinez has pressured lawmakers to act on license legislation, rather than letting it languish in committees where proposals were bottled by Democrats and left to die when the session ends this month. The governor has used campaign money to pay for radio ads on the issue and legislators have been flooded with automated phone calls arranged by the GOP.\par \par \uc2 Opponents of the legislation complained about the governor's tactics.\par \par \uc2 "The governor has stood up ... and waved her hands at the people and said, 'Let's take the driver's license away from this \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . We aren't taking licenses away from illegal immigrants. We're taking licenses away from foreign nationals," said Rep. Eliseo Alcon, D-Milan. "But they're using the words '\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 ' because this is the way that we can make the boogeyman sound bad."\par \par \uc2 On Thursday, Martinez and her allies used a parliamentary maneuver to bypass committees and force the 70-member House to debate Nunez's bill.\par \par \uc2 Martinez contends it's a security risk to give driver's licenses to illegal immigrants. Supporters of the policy say it's helped improve public safety, lessening fear among immigrants to report crimes to police and improving compliance with insurance requirements for motorists.\par \par \uc2 Regardless of the outcome of the vote, Republicans and Martinez will have campaign fodder for the 2012 elections, when the state House and Senate are up for election.\par \par \uc2 If the House approves Nunez's bill, it faces difficulty in the Senate. Two GOP-backed immigrant license bills failed in the Senate last month, and the Senate Public Affairs Committee shelved another proposal on Thursday on a party-line vote.\par \par \uc2 The New Mexico Conference of Catholic Bishops is lobbying against the House bill.\par \par \uc2 "This bill lacks compromise, and it lacks compassion for all those children who are brought to our state of no fault of their own, become part of our society and graduate from our high schools. They will not be able to get a driver's license. You need a compromise bill," said Allen Sanchez, conference executive director.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110304e7340000q\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

(AP) - Border Patrol agents shot beanbags at a group of suspected bandits in southern Arizona before the men returned fire and killed an agent late last year, according to court records documents obtained by The Associated Press on Thursday.\par \par \uc2 The FBI search warrant requests that were filed in U.S. District Court in Tucson provide the most detailed version yet of what happened in the Dec. 14 gun battle northwest of Nogales that left agent Brian Terry dead.\par \par \uc2 On the night of the deadly encounter, agents were trying to apprehend at least five suspected illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 The records, first obtained by the Arizona Daily Star, also show that an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  wounded in the shootout -- who's now the only person in custody linked to the slaying -- contends he never fired a shot.\par \par \uc2 The man hasn't been charged in connection with the fatal shooting -- only with illegal re-entry after deportation -- and is awaiting a May 10 trial, according to newspaper.\par \par \uc2 He was one of four people arrested near the scene on the night of the shooting, authorities said. The other three were illegal immigrants from Mexico and they were cleared and deported back to their home countries.\par \par \uc2 An FBI spokesman in Phoenix said the agency's investigation remains ongoing. No arrests have been made, but the U.S. Attorney's Office in Arizona said investigators and prosecutors aim to bring criminal charges against the people responsible for Terry's murder.\par \par \uc2 Terry, 40, was the 10th agent to die on duty in the Border Patrol's Tucson Sector since 1926 and the first agent shot to death since 1998. He was buried in his hometown of Detroit on Dec. 22.\par \par \uc2 The documents show the group of illegal border entrants refused commands to drop their weapons after agents confronted them.\par \par \uc2 Two agents fired beanbags at the migrants, who responded with gunfire. Two agents returned fire, but Terry was mortally wounded in the shootout.\par \par \uc2 Border Patrol officials declined to answer questions about protocol for use of force, citing the ongoing investigation.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Information from: Arizona Daily Star, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.azstarnet.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.azstarnet.com}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110303e733002xg\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - A day after a young woman described being slashed by a machete in a schoolyard while three friends were fatally shot nearby, jurors were shown the knife Thursday and were given details of the curious path that landed it in the hands of investigators.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors contend the rusty, 15-inch-long machete was used by defendant Alexander Alfaro to slash two of the four college-bound friends who had met to listen to music and hang out in the Mount Vernon School playground on the night of Aug. 4, 2007. The survivor isn't being named by The Associated Press because of sexual assault charges against two other defendants.\par \par \uc2 Alfaro, among six defendants in the case, faces 17 counts including murder, felony murder, robbery and weapons offenses. He's not believed to have participated in the execution-style shootings of Dashon Harvey and Iofemi Hightower, both 20, and Terrance Aeriel, 18.\par \par \uc2 Melvin Jovel, who confessed to being the shooter, and Rodolfo Godinez, convicted last year, are serving multiple life sentences for the crimes.\par \par \uc2 Connecting Alfaro to the machete will have to wait until at least next week when the trial resumes and possibly longer. Forensic evidence doesn't tie him to it, and the survivor was unable to identify him as her attacker or even as being present that night at the playground in Newark, the state's biggest city and historically one of its deadliest. Instead, prosecutors are likely to rely heavily on videotaped statements made by Alfaro after his arrest in Virginia two weeks after the murders.\par \par \uc2 In a March 2009 hearing to determine whether Alfaro's statements were made voluntarily, a Newark detective testified that the then-16-year-old was eager to "tell my side of the story."\par \par \uc2 Alfaro was arrested around the same time Godinez, his half-brother, was arrested in Maryland. It was revealed at the same hearing that another juvenile defendant, Shahid Baskerville, gave police information that helped lead to Alfaro's arrest.\par \par \uc2 The machete wasn't discovered until six days after the murders, during a nighttime memorial service at the playground and under murky circumstances. Newark police Capt. Derek Glenn testified Thursday that two people came up to him and told him that they had seen a knife lying on the ground near several television trucks gathered to film the memorial.\par \par \uc2 Glenn discovered the machete between two trucks, about 50 yards from where the four friends were attacked and in a spot where crime scene investigators couldn't have missed it in the hours following the killings. Glenn said he didn't ask for the names of the two men who told him where to look for the knife and couldn't remember what they looked like.\par \par \uc2 "So as we sit here today, it's fair to say we'll never know who those individuals were?" defense attorney Raymond Morasse asked on cross-examination.\par \par \uc2 "True," Glenn responded.\par \par \uc2 Alfaro lived with Godinez about two blocks from the school. Five of the six defendants had addresses listed in that neighborhood. A cousin, then-15-year-old Gerardo Gomez, was arrested four days after the murders, and Peruvian \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  Jose Carranza, then 28, turned himself in the next day. Baskerville was arrested in Morristown the day after that.\par \par \uc2 Each of the defendants, including Jovel and Godinez, initially pleaded not guilty to the charges against them. Trials for Gomez, Carranza and Baskerville haven't been scheduled.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110303e733002nl\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) - Allies of Republican Gov. Susana Martinez pressed the Democratic-controlled House for a politically charged vote on a proposal to stop New Mexico from issuing driver's licenses to illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Rep. Andy Nunez, a Hatch independent, maneuvered to try to force a debate on his license measure that is bottled up in a committee. Lawmakers could spend hours debating procedural matters before lawmakers focus on the underlying issue of licenses for illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Martinez vowed during last year's campaign to repeal a 2003 law that has allowed more than 80,000 driver's licenses to be issued to foreign nationals. State officials say they don't know how many went to illegal immigrants because people aren't asked for their immigration status when they apply for a license.\par \par \uc2 The governor contends it's a security risk to give driver's licenses to those living illegally in the country. Supporters of the state's policy say it's helped improve public safety by lessening fear among immigrants to report crimes to police and has improved compliance with requirements for motorists to have insurance.\par \par \uc2 Three states -- New Mexico, Washington and Utah -- allow illegal immigrants to get licenses because their laws do not require proof of citizenship. Utah issues driving privilege cards to immigrants, but the cards can't be used as government identification, unlike a driver's license in New Mexico.\par \par \uc2 Nunez said a five-member committee shouldn't decide the state's license policy. The House Consumer and Public Affairs Committee shelved his legislation last month on a 3-2 vote split along party lines, with Democrats opposing the measure.\par \par \uc2 "In this case it was three people who made the decision out of 70," said Nunez, a conservative who switched his party affiliation from Democrat to independent earlier this year.\par \par \uc2 With the one independent, Democrats cling to a narrow 36-33 majority in the House. Republicans picked up eight seats in last year's elections, eliminating the ability of Democrats to easily push aside GOP attempts to influence legislation.\par \par \uc2 Nunez used a parliamentary move to try to bring the bill to the House for a vote. But Democrats countered by requiring the House to debate and vote on separate procedural questions, such as whether the bill should be advanced to another committee and then whether to bring it to the floor. While they were dealing with those questions, House rules prevent lawmakers from debating the pros and cons of the immigrant license proposal. Up to three hours of debate is allowed on each procedural issue.\par \par \uc2 House Majority Leader Ken Martinez, D-Grants, said lawmakers shouldn't short-circuit the traditional practice of committees deciding the merits of legislation. Nunez's bill was subject to a more than four-hour hearing before a committee tabled it.\par \par \uc2 "It's been a long-standing tradition in this House that we work through the committee process. It's not to effect advantage," he said. "It's to allow the citizens to come before this Legislature and state their case."\par \par \uc2 But Nunez and Republicans said their constituents support an end to licenses for illegal immigrants and all House members should consider the issue.\par \par \uc2 "There are passionately held beliefs on both sides of the issue and they need to be respected, but they also need to be debated," said Rep. Dennis Kintigh, a Roswell Republican. "And that has not happened and it needs to happen for the good of this state and for our constituents. They need to know where we stand."\par \par \uc2 Forcing a House vote will provide Republicans with campaign fodder for the 2012 elections, when the House and Senate are up for election.\par \par \uc2 "This is a political maneuver, done for political purposes, organized for purely political reasons and it's going to do nothing to solve the problems before the state of New Mexico and get New Mexicans back to work and to help our economy get moving again," said Rep. Brian Egolf, D-Santa Fe.\par \par \uc2 If the House approves Nunez's bill, it faces trouble in the Senate, which rejected two GOP-backed bills on the issue last month. On Thursday, the Senate Public Affairs Committee voted 4-2 to shelve a bill to stop granting licenses to anyone without a Social Security number, which is unavailable to an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110303e733002h5\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 HATTIESBURG, Miss. (AP) - The former human resources manager of a Mississippi company was sentenced Thursday to six months house arrest for hiring hundreds of illegal immigrants who were rounded up in the largest workplace immigration raid in U.S. history.\par \par \uc2 Jose Humberto Gonzalez pleaded guilty in December 2009 to conspiracy and admitted hiring people he knew were in the country illegally to work at \uc2 Howard Industries\uc2  electrical transformer plant in Laurel. Immigration agents detained nearly 600 illegal immigrants during a raid at the plant on Aug. 25, 2008.\par \par \uc2 Gonzalez is the only company official charged in the case, but the privately owned Howard pleaded guilty to conspiracy Feb. 24. It was fined $2.5 million.\par \par \uc2 U.S. District Judge Keith Starrett also sentenced Gonzalez to five years probation and fined him $4,000. Starrett told Gonzalez that he's getting credit off his probation for the 15 months he spent waiting to be sentenced because it was delayed at the request of the prosecution due to its investigation. He was not jailed while he awaited sentencing.\par \par \uc2 In a lengthy statement he read to the court, Gonzalez said he is a classical violinist who came to the United States from Mexico City to study English at the University of Southern Mississippi.\par \par \uc2 That's where he met his wife, Amy, and started a family. He later coached soccer and taught school in Laurel before taking the job at \uc2 Howard Industries\uc2  in hopes of providing a better life for his children, he said.\par \par \uc2 "I will work everyday to improve as an individual. I admit my guilt," Gonzalez said. "I'm deeply sorry for the actions that brought me to this day. I'm asking the court for mercy."\par \par \uc2 But the judge pressed for an explanation.\par \par \uc2 Gonzalez said he didn't set out to hire illegal workers, but didn't do enough to stop it, either. He said he tried to get the company to implement more stringent safeguards like fingerprinting its employees, but it didn't.\par \par \uc2 "I knew it was happening, but I didn't have enough tools and courage to stand up and say, 'those are illegals,'" he said.\par \par \uc2 Gonzalez's attorney, Tim Holleman, said many illegal immigrants worked at the company before Gonzalez was hired. Then, the attorney said, Gonzalez was pressured to hire Latino workers, many of whom were illegal.\par \par \uc2 The illegal immigrants wouldn't have been working there "without people higher up being involved," Holleman said.\par \par \uc2 Starrett said there had been no proof of that entered into evidence.\par \par \uc2 "The common sense question would be: How could they not know," the judge said. "But there's been no proof."\par \par \uc2 Still, the judge said later that he hoped the $2.5 million fine will keep the company from hiring illegal immigrants in the future.\par \par \uc2 As for Gonzalez, the judge said the letters he received about Gonzalez's contributions to his family and the community were "refreshing." He also praised Gonzalez for his cooperation in the investigation.\par \par \uc2 "I think to incarcerate you would be a waste of resources," the judge said.\par \par \uc2 Gonzalez, wearing a dark suit, remained composed throughout the hearing, but his wife began to cry and had to sit down for a time when she tried to ask the court for mercy.\par \par \uc2 Most of the workers detained in the raid were deported, though Starrett said nine were convicted on illegal re-entry or identity theft charges for using fraudulent documents.\par \par \uc2 After pleading guilty last month, \uc2 Howard Industries\uc2  released a statement saying illegal workers used fraudulent documents to "circumvent the numerous identification checks" the company used.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) - Kansas saw its Hispanic population grow by 59 percent over the past decade but continued to see a decline in rural areas, with 77 of its 105 counties losing residents since 2000, the U.S. Census Bureau reported Thursday.\par \par \uc2 Figures provided to state officials and obtained by The Associated Press prior to their public release counted 300,042 Hispanic residents in 2010, representing 10.5 percent of the state's population. The 2000 Census found there were 188,252 Hispanic residents, 7 percent of the population.\par \par \uc2 Among those new residents is Juan Alejandre, the 36-year-old owner of one of Wichita's Poblano Mexican Grill restaurants. He moved in 2002 from Colorado to Kansas, where he bought out his partner's share in the restaurant.\par \par \uc2 "The opportunity here is a little bit better than the big cities," Alejandre said. "The schools are better for the kids, and also the work that we have. We don't have very much competition versus the big places."\par \par \uc2 The state's total population grew about 6 percent over the decade, to 2.85 million residents, up about 165,000 from the 2000 figure of 2.69 million\par \par \uc2 The continued growth in the Hispanic population comes as legislators are debating immigration issues. The Kansas House has a bill that includes a provision similar to an Arizona law enacted last year that requires law enforcement officers to check the status of people they stop who are suspected of being illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Sharon Spauth, a Hispanic resident of Wichita who moved with her family in 1970 from Colorado, said that as other states pass anti-immigrant legislation more Hispanics are moving into Kansas. Many of these new Kansas residents are legal immigrants, but feel such state laws are a "slap in the face" to Hispanics and jeopardize their undocumented family members.\par \par \uc2 Spauth, who workers as a tax preparer, said she worries about similar efforts now underway in the Kansas Legislature.\par \par \uc2 "Whenever you pass anti-immigrant legislation, even though you may have a green card, you are threatening the whole family," she said.\par \par \uc2 Kansas had an influx of Hispanic residents come into the state when Oklahoma passed restrictive anti-immigrant laws, and now people are coming in as Arizona, she said, noting three \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  families who attend her church moved in December to Kansas from Arizona as that state clamped down on illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 Also driving the population boost is the economic downturn in other states. Kansas for decades has drawn new immigrant workers to its meatpacking plants in western Kansas.\par \par \uc2 "When other states have a lack of prosperity, we have waves of them that come into Kansas," Spauth said.\par \par \uc2 In the isolated counties that have seen population growth, much of that can be attributed to the increase in the Hispanic population.\par \par \uc2 For example, Crawford County in southeast Kansas saw an increase of 892 residents and an increase in the Hispanic population of 852. The count went from 910 Hispanic residents in 2000 to 1,762 in 2010, a 94 percent increase.\par \par \uc2 In Seward County, the total population increased by 442 residents, but the Hispanic population grew by 37 percent, from 9,486 in 2000 to 12,990 in 2010. Next door in Stevens, the county increased by 261 residents overall, while the Hispanic population grew by 57 percent, from 1,187 in 2000 to 1,866 in 2010.\par \par \uc2 The same trend holds true in Cowley, Ford, Gray, Hamilton, Pratt, and Saline counties.\par \par \uc2 Mario Lopez, a lifelong Hispanic resident of Garden City who runs an insurance agency, said many of the new immigrants are coming to western Kansas to take jobs at the meatpacking plants located in the region.\par \par \uc2 "We, along with the cities of Dodge City and Liberal, are pretty much the beef triangle of the world," Lopez said. "There is a lot of processing, cattle raising, things like that that go on in our community."\par \par \uc2 Emira Palacios, immigrant rights initiative coordinator at Sunflower Community Action in Wichita, said she moved to Wichita in 1985 because she had a couple of brothers that lived there. She became a naturalized citizen in 2005. She came to Kansas to "look for the American dream, to look for better opportunities."\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, most Kansas counties saw their populations drop, continuing a trend seen in past decades as a state known for its agriculture becomes more urban and suburban.\par \par \uc2 Gov. Sam Brownback is proposing to create rural enterprise zones in counties that have seen a population decline of 10 percent or more over the past decade. People who move into those counties from outside Kansas wouldn't have to pay individual income taxes for five years.\par \par \uc2 The proposal also includes a county option to help repay college loans of new residents, splitting the cost with the state.\par \par \uc2 The Senate has approved both proposals, though its version of the rural enterprise zones plan is more generous than Brownback's proposal.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press Writer Roxana Hegeman in Wichita contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 5\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110303e733001a1\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) - Nebraska could save money by requiring local law enforcement to check the residency status of suspected illegal immigrants, the lawmaker behind the plan argued Wednesday. But opponents warned it could do just the opposite and said the issue should be left to Congress.\par \par \uc2 The bill would force suspected illegal immigrants to prove their legal status when stopped, detained or arrested for another offense, and legal immigrants who fail to carry a residency card could face a misdemeanor charge. The measure borrows heavily from Arizona's controversial law, much of which has been put on hold by the courts.\par \par \uc2 Sen. Charlie Janssen, of Fremont, pitched his bill to the Legislature's Judiciary Committee as a cost-saving plan, saying it would help lower the state's health care and education expenses. Opponents said the loss of immigrant workers would hurt businesses that use their labor, shatter families and impose additional costs on law enforcement.\par \par \uc2 The packed hearing drew strong responses from advocates on both sides of the nation's immigration debate. A retired federal magistrate testified that the bill would trigger lawsuits.\par \par \uc2 Sen. Brenda Council, of Omaha, said a mass exodus of immigrants could cost the state as much as $152 million a year through production losses. Council also said the bill would face an expensive constitutional challenge if passed that the state would likely lose.\par \par \uc2 "I think all of us are frustrated over the fact that the federal government has failed in its obligation to enact appropriate immigration reform," Council said. "But in terms of how do we as a state respond to that, I don't believe that under our constitution, and our constitutional form of government, that we have the authority" to regulate immigration.\par \par \uc2 Council introduced a counter measure that urges Nebraska's congressional delegation to reform the nation's immigration system at the federal level.\par \par \uc2 But Janssen said waiting for Congress to act is unrealistic.\par \par \uc2 The Nebraska measure addresses racial profiling by specifying that "a peace officer's reasonable suspicion shall not be based solely upon a person's race, color, religion, sex or national origin."\par \par \uc2 Janssen's measure differs from the Arizona law in some aspects but still drew criticism from immigration advocates that opposed Arizona's law.\par \par \uc2 John Freudenberg, chief of the Nebraska Attorney General's criminal bureau, acknowledged that officers could use a person's race, accent, English language skills or lack of a driver's license as factors that could lead to the needed "reasonable suspicion." Freudenberg said officers also would need to question a suspected \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  before they could check his or her immigration status.\par \par \uc2 Nebraska attracted national attention last year when voters in the city of Fremont approved a ban on hiring or renting to illegal immigrants. The decision was placed on hold pending lawsuits by the American Civil Liberties Union of Nebraska and the Mexican American Legal Defense & Educational Fund. Both cases are scheduled for trial in April 2012.\par \par \uc2 The Judiciary Committee's chairman, state Sen. Brad Ashford of Omaha, said the immigration debate was important but shouldn't occupy the state legislature's time. Ashford said he supported Council's effort to press Congress for reform.\par \par \uc2 "We can have all these hearings until the cows come home," Ashford said, adding that "it's not going to make any difference" until Congress takes action.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Immigration bill is LB48.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110303e733000g3\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc18}{\*\bkmkend toc18}\b \uc2 Texas mulls Arizona-style illegal immigration law\b0\par\par\uc2 By JAY ROOT   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 753 \uc2 words\par \uc2 2 March 2011\par 23:55\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2011.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 AUSTIN, Texas (AP) - State and local police officers would be allowed -- but not required -- to help enforce federal immigration laws under a compromise plan working its way through the Texas Legislature.\par \par \uc2 The bill is a far cry from some of the harsh crackdowns some lawmakers proposed, but it still sparked often emotional testimony in a House committee Wednesday night. Dozens of supporters and detractors packed a hearing room outside the Texas Capitol, eager for a chance to air their views despite the late hour.\par \par \uc2 Supporters generally said the legislation would help police identify illegal immigrants who commit crimes in Texas. Critics said it would lead to racial profiling, detract from real police work and give license to rogue agents who want to harass immigrants.\par \par \uc2 The bill's author, Republican Rep. Burt Solomons, said it would prohibit so-called "sanctuary cities" and law enforcement entities from adopting policies that keep police and criminal investigators from providing immigration enforcement assistance. Republican Gov. Rick Perry put the issue on the fast track at the Capitol after making it a major theme of his 2010 re-election campaign.\par \par \uc2 Unlike Arizona's new immigration law, parts of which are being challenged in court, the legislation known as House Bill 12 does not require police officers to inquire about immigration status or enforce federal laws when people are detained. But the bill would not allow any law enforcement agency from adopting policies that prohibit them from doing so. Solomons said his proposal would establish a "uniform consistent policy" across the state.\par \par \uc2 "There's nothing in this bill that requires a police officer to ask one question that they don't think they need to ask," Solomons said. "We're not mandating anything."\par \par \uc2 It would allow police to ask about immigration status, maintain records of it and work with federal agents on immigration matters when people are "lawfully detained for the investigation of a criminal offense or arrested." Other legislation similar to the Arizona law was also proposed, but Perry's office has been working with Solomons on the compromise bill. The legislation was left pending in a House committee Wednesday night, but other bills were being debated, including one that would make English the official language and create a state database of illegal immigrants arrested in Texas.\par \par \uc2 An estimated 1.6 million illegal immigrants are in Texas, according to the Pew Hispanic Center in Washington. Nationwide, their numbers declined between 2007 and 2009, from 12 million to 11.1 million, the first significant drop after two decades of growth. But their combined population in Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana went up by a statistically significant 240,000, the center reported last month.\par \par \uc2 Immigration curbs have caught fire nationwide. In 2010, a record number of laws and resolutions were passed by state legislatures, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, which calculated that 46 states and the District of Columbia had passed 346 measures, with an additional 10 having fallen from gubernatorial vetoes.\par \par \uc2 Former Houston police officer Rick Salter, who was shot in the face by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  in 2009 and who now speaks through paralyzed vocal chords, was among those urging lawmakers to pass HB 12 Wednesday night.

"You won't know that until you're slapped in the face by something that happens to you by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 ."\par \par \uc2 Austin Police Chief Art Acevedo, arguing against the legislation, said he sympathized with victims of crime by illegal immigrants. But he said local police already are helping federal officials prosecute and deport illegal immigrants without getting mandates from the state.\par \par \uc2 "We are leading through emotion and politics instead of good public policy," Acevedo said.\par \par \uc2 Other critics said the bill could allow local police agencies, including those run by school districts and college campuses, to become de-facto immigration enforcement agents. Rep. Sylvester Turner, D-Houston, said the legislation would let rank-and-file police officers spend all the time they want enforcing immigration laws even if their supervisors don't want them to.\par \par \uc2 "This officer ... is given the authority to say to the police chief, to the mayor, to the City Council: I don't care how much time it takes, you can't stop me from doing this," Turner said.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110303e7330001e\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 LANSING, Mich. (AP) - A proposal that would get police more involved in checking the immigration status of people they pull over sparked criticism Tuesday at the Michigan Capitol, with an immigrant rights group and some pastors saying it would create a climate of fear and division.\par \par \uc2 Republican Rep. Dave Agema of Grandville said the bill he introduced last week was a "common sense" measure to help ensure that federal immigration law is enforced in Michigan.\par \par \uc2 The measure would require law enforcement officers to make a "complete, full and appropriate attempt" to verify a person's immigration status after the person is stopped for another offense and officers have probable cause to suspect the person is in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 People who don't have a driver's license or other documentation and are suspected to be illegal immigrants could be turned over to federal custody. Agencies or officials that adopt policies limiting or restricting the enforcement of federal immigration law could face fines.\par \par \uc2 The Alliance for Immigrants Rights and Reform Michigan said the proposal would allow police to stop and arrest people solely on the suspicion they may be in the U.S. illegally and deportable.\par \par \uc2 Agema said that wouldn't be the case, and that the immigration status check would come only after someone had been arrested or stopped on suspicion of violating state or local law and didn't have proper identification.\par \par \uc2 "If they were drunk driving or they were caught stealing, that's when they'd do it," Agema said. "They don't just pull them over because `hey, that guy looks like he's an illegal.' No. That's not in the bill."\par \par \uc2 Agema said illegal immigration is costly to Michigan through higher costs for health care, education and human services.\par \par \uc2 Opponents say the bill would hurt Michigan's business climate and reputation by creating an atmosphere where even legal immigrants feel unwelcome. Opponents said the Michigan bill is patterned after one in Arizona that sparked national criticism.\par \par \uc2 "The future of Michigan's economy relies on attracting the best and brightest from across the world," Rev. Fred Thelen, pastor of Cristo Rey Catholic Church in Lansing, said in a statement. "It would be foolish to pass this law and signal to the world that Michigan does not welcome the world, but treats it with suspicion."\par \par \uc2 Opponents said the bill "virtually mandates" racial profiling, but bill supporters said protections against racial profiling are in place. The proposal states that it would be enforced in a manner consistent with federal immigration laws and "protecting the civil rights of all persons."\par \par \uc2 Michigan's law enforcement officers already have the power to contact federal immigration officials if they've stopped someone that they have probable cause to believe is in the country illegally. But Michigan State Police say there's no state immigration law that makes that a requirement or spells out procedures to follow if they suspect they've stopped an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ----\par \par \uc2 The bill is House Bill 4305.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110301e7310025c\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 MIAMI (AP) - Tallahassee lawmakers are pushing for a watered-down version of Arizona's tough illegal immigration laws, saying it's part of a broad effort by states to enact laws that will force Washington to create a uniform set of immigration reforms.\par \par \uc2 Florida Senate President Pro Tem Mike Bennett, R-Bradenton, calls the latest proposals "immigration light." They will be considered during the upcoming 60-day legislative session, which begins March 8.\par \par \uc2 "Nothing out of Florida is going to resemble Arizona," he recently told The Associated Press. "A lot of it is to get the federal government to take notice and take action."\par \par \uc2 Immigrant rights groups say the state should be passing bills that are good for Florida, not to make political statements. They remain worried some of the proposals could lead to racial profiling.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, some law enforcement agencies say the measures could create unfunded burdens on them, while business groups say it may scare off foreign investment, immigrant entrepreneurs and tourism.\par \par \uc2 Bennett's initial bill, a placeholder filed last fall to accompany one filed by State Rep. William Snyder, R-Stuart, did resemble the Arizona law.\par \par \uc2 That bill made it a misdemeanor not to carry proof of citizenship or valid immigration papers but made no mention of tourist or temporary work visas, both of which are far more common in Florida than Arizona. Bennett said he didn't read the bill before putting his name on it. He has since filed another that focuses on early release and deportation of immigrants convicted of certain crimes.\par \par \uc2 Other bills being considered in the House and Senate would require local law enforcement to check the immigration status of anyone they arrest; require all Florida employers to use the federal work eligibility database known as E-verify; and allow private citizens to sue local law enforcement agencies for failing to enforce state immigration laws. Another provision would require local law enforcement to be trained in immigration enforcement, but only if the federal government provides funding.\par \par \uc2 Bennett predicted similar legislation will be passed in more than a dozen states around the country this year and has been in contact with counterparts in Arkansas, Missouri, California and Texas, though in states like Arkansas and California, the chances for such proposals are looking dim.\par \par \uc2 Another bill, unlikely to gain much traction this year, would allow \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students living in Florida to pay in-state tuition to the University of Florida College System.\par \par \uc2 State Sen. Anitere Flores, R-Westchester and chairwoman of the Judiciary Committee, says the majority of her colleagues now agree "the Florida bill will not be as far reaching as the Arizona bill."\par \par \uc2 She seconded Bennett's notion the final legislation should "send a strong message to the federal government," without hurting Florida's tourism industry.\par \par \uc2 A revised Senate bill is expected Friday. Snyder's office did not have a date for a revised House version.\par \par \uc2 Maria Rodriguez, executive director of the Florida Immigrant Coalition, said she is relieved lawmakers are backing off the Arizona-style proposals. But she said even the latest bills "divert time and energy from what really ails us. These are not going to get us more jobs. They're not going to cut down on foreclosures."\par \par \uc2 She is also concerned that some of the initial provisions from the Arizona bill will make their way into the final version.\par \par \uc2 Bennett says the problems related to the influx of illegal immigration in the state must be addressed. He connected the rise of gang activity in Manatee County to the influx of illegal immigrants. He said the state is housing an estimated 5,600 illegal immigrants in its jails and prisons, about 5 percent of the inmate population.\par \par \uc2 Last year, the Department of Justice authorized $13.8 million for Florida to cover the cost of housing \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  inmates. Manatee County was among the 10 counties receiving the largest amount.\par \par \uc2 The Florida Chamber of Commerce, which has expressed concern about the proposals, says that while incarceration of immigrants costs Florida more than $90 million a year even with the federal aid, immigrants contribute an average 50 times that in state taxes. The chamber has urged lawmakers to work with the federal government on the issue.\par \par \uc2 In Martin County, which has seen a significant rise in immigrants in recent decades, Sheriff Robert Crowder said his deputies regularly check the immigration status of those arrested.\par \par \uc2 "But if they start requiring us to do things we can't do because of manpower, that's a problem," he said, referring to the cost of having to drop inmates of at federal immigration facilities, more than a two-hour drive from his county.\par \par \uc2 Crowder also fears that if federal immigration violations become state crimes, Florida will lose the federal funds that help cover immigrant inmates. And he is concerned about frivolous lawsuits against his agency.\par \par \uc2 "If we don't just go out there and get people who look Mexican and bring them in for checking, the radicals accuse us of being sanctuary cities," he said.\par \par \uc2 Bennett say he recognizes the issue is more complicated than he first thought.\par \par \uc2 For example, he says, "I did not think about the number of people who are serving in our military who are not citizens of our country, who are out there fighting for our family, to protect our country" -- some of whom also have relatives facing deportation.\par \par \uc2 "The whole immigration problem is truly a heart-wrenching problem because a lot of those people who came here illegally were doing the exact same thing I would do if I would have to feed my family," he said. "But it's still against the law."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110301e731001ux\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

Latino population surges 77 percent\b0\par\par\uc2 By JOSH FUNK   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 691 \uc2 words\par \uc2 1 March 2011\par 18:20\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2011.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 OMAHA, Neb. (AP) - Nebraska's population became more diverse over the past decade, particularly among Latinos whose numbers surged more than 77 percent, the U.S. Census Bureau reported Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 What the local population count doesn't reveal is how many of the state's 167,405 Hispanics, now accounting for more than 9 percent of Nebraska's population, are illegal immigrants. The Legislature plans to hold a hearing Wednesday on a bill that would require police officers, when enforcing other laws, to question the immigration status of those they suspect are in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 Although the Latino population represented the biggest surge from 2000 to 2010, other minority groups also became larger, accounting for an overall growth rate of 6.7 percent for the state. The black population grew 20 percent to 80,959, and the Asian population grew 47 percent to 31,919.\par \par \uc2 The number of white residents grew nearly 3 percent to 1,572,838 in 2010 from 1,533,261 in 2000. Their percentage of the population declined from 90 percent to 86 percent.\par \par \uc2 As Nebraska has become more diverse in recent years, conflict over illegal immigration has emerged in several parts of the state.\par \par \uc2 State lawmakers are considering several bills related to illegal immigration this year, and last year voters in the city of Fremont approved a measure that prohibits hiring or renting to illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Lourdes Gouveia, director of the University of Nebraska at Omaha's Latino/Latin American Studies Department, says many immigrants in Nebraska feel ignored or neglected by the state's policymakers. The state's overall climate has become increasingly hostile toward immigrants, Gouveia said.\par \par \uc2 Gouveia said the state should be finding ways to help immigrants settle in Nebraska because of the potential long-term benefits to the state's economy.\par \par \uc2 "Immigrants and the children of immigrants continue to be the motor of economic development in this state," Gouveia said\par \par \uc2 The police questioning measure being considered Wednesday also would require non-U.S. citizens to carry documents showing their legal status. Failure to do so would be a misdemeanor. The measure criminalizes harboring, hiding or transporting an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . Violation of that would be a misdemeanor.\par \par \uc2 The bill from Fremont Sen. Charlie Janssen is similar to a controversial Arizona law. Janssen said his proposal deals with the legal status of immigrants, not their race, so the Census numbers aren't likely to affect it.\par \par \uc2 "I think if people are immigrating here legally, that's great," Janssen said. "This isn't about the increasing Latino population in Nebraska."\par \par \uc2 Critics say the Arizona law encourages racial profiling. A federal judge blocked sections of the law in July, including provisions calling for police to check a person's immigration status while enforcing other laws and requiring immigrants to prove they are in the United States legally.\par \par \uc2 Janssen's measure differs from the Arizona law in that it does not allow law enforcement to make warrantless arrests of suspected illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 The Census numbers also show that urban areas of the state grew at a faster pace than rural areas, so more of Nebraska's population is now on the eastern end of the state.\par \par \uc2 Only 24 of Nebraska's 93 counties gained population between 2000 and 2010 while the rest of the counties lost population. Most of the counties that gained population are in eastern Nebraska near the state's two largest cities of Omaha and Lincoln.\par \par \uc2 The eastward population shift is partly why state lawmakers must redraw the lines for the state's three congressional districts and 49 state legislative districts this year. But Nebraska won't lose any of its three U.S. House seats.\par \par \uc2 Douglas County's population grew nearly 12 percent to remain the largest, with 517,110 residents. Lancaster County grew 14 percent to remain second at 285,407. Sarpy County, home to the Omaha suburbs of La Vista and Bellevue, grew nearly 30 percent, and is home to 158,840 people.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Online:\par \par \uc2 U.S. Census: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.census.gov"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.census.gov}}}\par \par \uc2 Nebraska Legislature: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.nebraskalegislature.gov"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.nebraskalegislature.gov}}}\par \par \uc2 5\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110301e731001ep\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) - A Senate panel voted Monday to subpoena a construction company that helped renovate a building on the state Capitol grounds after a lawmaker claimed that the business had hired illegal immigrants for some work.\par \par \uc2 The Senate State Agencies and Governmental Affairs committee issued the subpoena to S&G Construction, which is based in Beebe, for a May 11 joint hearing. The move came days after a lawmaker told the panel that the company used \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  workers on part of the renovation of a room in the Multi-Agency Complex, located adjacent to the state Capitol.\par \par \uc2 "If there's some flaw in the system here because we had a person who may have been undocumented working on a state project, and it's clear there are supposed to be steps to go through to make sure this doesn't happen and we have this side issue of someone not being paid, someone needs to be held responsible," Sen. Sue Madison, the committee's chairwoman, told reporters after the vote.\par \par \uc2 Rep. Jim Nickels told the panel last week that S&G Construction hired the illegal immigrants while it worked as a subcontractor for VCC, which was the lead contractor on the project. The phone number listed for S&G was disconnected.\par \par \uc2 Brad Davis, VCC's chief financial officer, said last week that the first time he had heard of the complaint was when he was asked to appear before the panel last week. Davis said his business relies on its subcontractors to follow all state and federal laws for hiring.\par \par \uc2 Nickels, D-Sherwood, made the claim as he presented legislation that would allow the state to revoke the licenses of contractors that knowingly hire illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Anne Laidlaw, director of the Arkansas Building Authority, said her committee was not investigating the claim because it had not received any complaint. S&G's workers were on the job site for only three days and did not return to work, so the firm's contract was terminated, Laidlaw said. The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported last week that Manuel Damacho, who said he is in the country illegally, told the newspaper that S&G hired him to frame some rooms for the project and that he was never paid the $7,000 he was promised.\par \par \uc2 Nickels used the claim as an example of why his legislation is needed.\par \par \uc2 "I think what it shows is the inadequacy of the current law," Nickels said.\par \par \uc2 Nickels' proposal would allow the state Contractors Licensing Board to revoke or suspend the licenses of contractors found to knowingly hire illegal immigrants. He pulled his proposal down to look at changes to the measure after officials with the board questioned how the new restrictions could be enforced.\par \par \uc2 Scott Copas, the board's chairman, said one problem is that the board only licenses about 40 percent of contractors in the state.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 H.B.1013: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/assembly/2011/2011R/Bills/HB1013.pdf"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/assembly/2011/2011R/Bills/HB1013.pdf}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110301e7310002q\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 HEADLINES\par \par \uc2 A proposal to make cuts to the HOPE scholarship is moving rapidly through the Georgia Legislature. The House Appropriations Committee approved the measure just two days after Gov. Nathan Deal and Republican legislative leaders introduced the bill. Under the proposal, HOPE would pay for full public college tuition for students who earn a 3.7 grade point average or better, who also receive at least a 1200 on the SAT. That represents roughly 10 percent of current HOPE recipients. For years, HOPE has provided free public college tuition to those students with a 3.0 grade point average or better. Under the GOP plan, students with at least a 3.0 grade point average would receive 90 percent of their tuition. HOPE would no longer pay for books, fees or remedial classes, under the plan. Pre-kindergarten programs would also see deep cuts. Deal's plan would reduce pre-k to a half-day program -- down from 6 1/2 hours a day to four. The change would allow him to add 5,000 more slots to continue to make the program -- which has a waiting list of some 10,000 4-year-olds -- available to as many as possible.\par \par \uc2 ODDS & ENDS\par \par \uc2 --The House has voted 98-69 to approve legislation that would allow billboard owners to clear-cut trees blocking motorists from seeing their signs, a battle that has been fought for years at the state Capitol. Supporters say it's needed to protect economic development and jobs. Opponents say it would allow for the removal of old-growth trees and greenways that are now protected.\par \par \uc2 --The Senate has approved the $18 billion amended budget for the remainder of the fiscal year in a plan that includes more money for hospitals serving poor patients. The spending plan was approved 46-4. It must now be reconciled with a version approved earlier this month in the House. The amended budget covers the fiscal year that ends June 30.\par \par \uc2 --The Senate voted 32-16 to create a 16-member panel to weigh issues related to state health insurance benefits. The Special Advisory Commission on Mandated Health Insurance Benefits would take effect on Feb. 1, 2012. Most members would be appointed by the governor and would include doctors and health care professionals and representatives from the small business and medical ethics industries. The House and Senate would each appoint two members from committees.\par \par \uc2 --The Georgia House has moved to shorten the early voting period to three weeks and has added a Saturday for casting ballots. Approved 148-20, the bill sets a statewide start date for in-person, no-excuse early voting. Under the bill, advance voting would begin the fourth Monday preceding a primary and general election and as soon as possible before a runoff. Early voting would end the Friday immediately prior to each election.\par \par \uc2 --The Senate has again signaled its support for a constitutional amendment that would fix state spending and use any surplus to pay down debt or go toward a rainy day fund. The Senate approved the proposal 42-7. Senate Majority Leader Chip Rogers says the resolution would restrict the state from spending money in excess of the previous year's budget adjusted for inflation and population. If approved by the Legislature, the amendment would be on the 2012 general election ballot.\par \par \uc2 --Nathan Deal has signed his first piece of legislation as governor. The legislation allows renewal of a voter-approved tax for Carroll County. Without action by March 15, it would have expired this year. State Rep. Tim Bearden, a Villa Rica Republican, requested the expedited review by the governor. Early voting on the tax has already begun in Carroll County.\par \par \uc2 --A Georgia lawmaker is proposing that the state track and report the number of students and medical patients who are illegal immigrants or unable to prove their citizenship. The bill would require the Board of Education and Department of Community Health to publish their findings on their websites by Jan. 1 of each year.\par \par \uc2 --A key Republican senator wants public utilities and their employees to be able to contribute to political campaigns. State Sen. Don Balfour introduced legislation that would permit the donations to political action committees. Utilities and their employees would still be barred from contributing to members of the state Public Service Commission. Balfour said the current law is "blatantly unconstitutional" because it prevents some 41,000 utility employees in Georgia from making political contributions.\par \par \uc2 --Supporters of legislation that would let local communities vote on whether to have Sunday alcohol sales say the issue is still alive and that lawmakers should let voters weigh in on the issue. About 75 people gathered at the Georgia Capitol for a rally prompted by a \uc2 Facebook\uc2  group called Georgians for Sunday Alcohol Sales. Several legislators joined the rally, including Sen. John Bulloch and Rep. Roger Williams, the bill's sponsors.\par \par \uc2 -- Deal says he is committed to helping disabled Georgians who want to remain independent in their communities and improve their quality of life. Deal spoke to hundreds gathered at the Capitol for Disability Day and was praised as a champion for disabled rights during his four decades as a public servant. He told the crowd he plans to create at least 1,000 waivers during his time in office to help people transitioning out of hospitals and nursing homes.\par \par \uc2 --Georgia lawmakers moved one step closer toward banning a new brand of synthetic drug that is marketed as bath salts and sold legally under brand names like "Ivory Wave" and "Cloud Nine." The House Judiciary Non-Civil Committee voted to outlaw the five main chemicals used to create "bath salts," which are drugs usually snorted like cocaine but also can be smoked and injected. It was adopted by a 7-1 vote.\par \par \uc2 --Georgia may be making budget cuts, but a bipartisan group of House legislators wants to extend a tax break on jet fuel that saves \uc2 Delta Air Lines\uc2  and other carriers about $25 million a year in state taxes. The tax break is set to expire on July 1. The bill would extend it until 2013.\par \par \uc2 --Deal says he's not interested in a war of words with neighboring South Carolina but he recognizes the tremendous competition among ports along the East Coast. Deal says the two states should work together for the good of both economies. The expansion of the Panama Canal is pitting seaports up and down the Atlantic coast in a race to dig deeper harbors.\par \par \uc2 --Civil and human rights activists are opposing bills that they say are anti-immigrant and encourage racial profiling. Two of the bills would require law officers, when enforcing other laws, to try to determine an individual's immigration status if an officer "develops reasonable suspicion" that the person is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 QUOTE\par \par \uc2 "I'm really disappointed in all of you," -- Rose Dasher, a 19-year-old freshman at the University of Georgia, speaking to lawmakers about cuts to the HOPE scholarship.\par \par \uc2 DAYS IN SESSION\par \par \uc2 21 days remain in the 40-day legislative session.\par \par \uc2 LOOK AHEAD\par \par \uc2 The House is expected to vote on legislation making cuts to the HOPE scholarship program. A House committee is expected to vote on a sweeping immigration bill.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110225e72p002qb\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 DENVER (AP) - Colorado law enforcement would have to alert prosecutors if they suspect a person in their custody is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  under a bill tentatively approved Thursday by House lawmakers.\par \par \uc2 The bill would also force bail bond agents to forfeit a bond if a client is deported, a move meant to make the businesses more diligent about their transactions.\par \par \uc2 Legislators approved House Bill 1088 on a voice vote without any lawmakers speaking against it, but several yelled "No!" during the vote call. The proposal still faces another vote before it heads to the Senate.\par \par \uc2 Immigrant advocates say they're worried the bill will lead to discrimination but supporters argue the proposal is needed to make prosecutors aware of a suspect's immigration status and whether he or she is a flight risk.\par \par \uc2 "This bill is about ensuring that the parties who are charged with crimes appear in Colorado court to face justice," said Republican Rep. Mark Barker, the bill's prime sponsor. "That's all it does."\par \par \uc2 Barker made substantial changes to his bill to appease concerns from opponents before his colleagues voted on the House floor. When Barker first introduced it, his bill sought to lower the legal standard of "probable cause" to "reasonable grounds" for believing someone was in the country illegally when determining bail. His bill also would have required judge's to consider a person's immigration status when setting bail.\par \par \uc2 Barker's bill now contains the existing standard of probable cause and he eliminated the language about judge's needing to consider immigration status on bail hearings. That's something that's already allowed under current statutes, said Tom Raynes, executive director of the Colorado District Attorneys' Council, which supports Barker's bill.\par \par \uc2 Raynes said some opponents of the measure worried that lowering the probable cause standard at bail hearings and on whether to alert prosecutors about a suspect's immigration status would lead to a "witch hunt."\par \par \uc2 "And I said, you know what? I don't want to have that argument. I don't believe law enforcement will do that but if it makes folks more comfortable to leave (the probable cause standard) the way it is, let's leave it the way it is," he said.\par \par \uc2 The modified bill still concerns immigrant advocates. Hans Meyer, policy director of the Colorado Immigrant Rights Coalition, said the group is "encouraged by the fact that some of the more noxious provisions were stripped out," but that they still believe it will have negative impacts.\par \par \uc2 "Furthermore, the bill would create an environment that incentivizes the use of inappropriate factors such as race, ethnicity, national origin, and language skills in the setting of a reasonable bail," he said.\par \par \uc2 Dennis Barlett, executive director of the American Bail Coalition, said the bail industry opposes the bill.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110224e72o002mu\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHOENIX (AP) - Fatigue with the illegal immigration issue could stand in the way of new legislation being considered by Arizona lawmakers, including a sweeping bill championed by the same senator whose law last year prompted nationwide protests.\par \par \uc2 The many provisions of Senate President Russell Pearce's latest bill target education and other public services as well as activities ranging from hiring to driving.\par \par \uc2 Pearce's late-emerging bill and other proposals sponsored by fellow Republicans cleared a Senate committee dominated by conservatives late Tuesday. But two committee Republicans voted against Pearce's bill, and a GOP senator who's not on the committee said Wednesday that full Senate votes on the measures will be close.\par \par \uc2 Minority Democrats regularly vote against most Republican hard-liners' illegal immigration bills, "and there are other Republicans besides me that have concerns with them," said Sen. John McComish of Phoenix. "We need a timeout on immigration bills."\par \par \uc2 Pearce drafted his bill Friday and introduced it Monday, past the normal deadline.\par \par \uc2 "This was a very quick fix (at the) last minute to make sure that we did not ignore the voters of this state," he said, referring to provisions that would tighten illegal immigration laws approved by voters in the last decade.\par \par \uc2 However, Alessandra Soler Meetze, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Arizona, said, "This bill is miles beyond SB1070 in terms of its potential to roll back the rights and fundamental freedoms of both citizens and non-citizens alike."\par \par \uc2 Opponents also said fallout would damage the state's economy just as businesses are poised to regain lost ground. Passage of SB1070 last year touched off calls for boycotts and a national debate on whether states can enforce federal immigration laws. Key portions of the law have been put on hold by a court pending outcome of legal challenges.\par \par \uc2 The Senate Appropriations Committee that narrowly endorsed Pearce's latest bill on a 7-6 vote also approved others targeting automatic citizenship for U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants and requiring hospitals to report patients who cannot show they're in the country legally.\par \par \uc2 The measures now face a legal review and discussions by party caucuses before being considered by the full Senate. Passage would send them to the House.\par \par \uc2 Two committee Republicans joined four Democrats in voting against Pearce's bill.\par \par \uc2 It would make it a state crime with a 30-day minimum jail sentence to drive a vehicle while in the country illegally, and Republican Rick Crandall of Mesa said a provision allowing forfeiture of vehicles driven by illegal immigrants could prompt car rental companies to demand proof of legal status from tourists and other visitors.\par \par \uc2 "It's the type of thing that completely undoes" a recently unveiled campaign to promote the state's tourism industry, Crandall said.\par \par \uc2 The measure allows for business licenses to be suspended if an employer doesn't use the federal E-Verify system to check the work eligibility of new hires. Workers caught using a false identity to get a job would face mandatory six-month jail sentences.\par \par \uc2 It also requires schools to collect information on the legal status of students and report them to law enforcement if their parents don't provide the necessary documents or the documents appear false.\par \par \uc2 Public universities and community colleges would be barred from admitting students who cannot demonstrate legal status.\par \par \uc2 In housing, the bill requires public agencies to verify the immigration status of renters and to evict everyone living in a unit if one is found to be an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . For health care, the bill changes some of the document requirements for the state's Medicaid program.\par \par \uc2 The bill turns public officials into immigration officers and "launches an unprecedented attack on minorities and people of color," said Jaime Farrant of the Border Action Network, an advisory group.\par \par \uc2 But the Appropriations Committee chairman, Republican Sen. Andy Biggs, said the bill was a response "to economic and social costs that we face with the onslaught of illegal aliens in our state."\par \par \uc2 "We need to have the moral courage to deal with this issue when there is a vacuum at the federal level," he said.\par \par \uc2 Democrats said Republicans should be focused on the state's ailing economy, not taking steps that would hurt it.\par \par \uc2 "This is totally the wrong time for the leader of our Senate to throw our state into another state of chaos," said Democratic Sen. Paula Aboud of Tucson.\par \par \uc2 Sponsors of the automatic citizenship bill hope it will prompt a court interpretation on an element of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which guarantees citizenship to people born in the country and who are "subject to the jurisdiction" of the U.S.\par \par \uc2 Bill proponents said the amendment shouldn't apply to the children of illegal immigrants because such families don't owe sole allegiance to the U.S.\par \par \uc2 The committee also approved an accompanying proposal that would establish an interstate compact that defines who is a U.S. citizen and asks states to issue separate birth certificates for those who are citizens and those who are designated as not citizens.\par \par \uc2 Similar proposals defining who would get automatic citizenship have been introduced in Indiana, Mississippi, Texas, Oklahoma and South Dakota. Backers expect another dozen states will take up the issue this year.\par \par \uc2 The other bill originally barred nonemergency treatment without proof of legal status but was amended to only require hospitals to report patients who lack valid health insurance and who cannot show they're in the country legally.\par \par \uc2 Supporters said it still would help reduce health care costs and burdens on taxpayers. Critics said it could deter some people from seeking needed care.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press reporter Bob Christie contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110223e72n000am\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) - An Arizona jury on Tuesday sentenced the leader of an anti-\uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2  group to death in the 2009 murder of a young girl and her father in what prosecutors said was an attempt to steal drug money to fund the group's operations.\par \par \uc2 Shawna Forde, the leader of the Minutemen American Defense, a small border watch group, becomes the third woman on Arizona's death row, the Pima County Attorney's Office said.\par \par \uc2 The 43-year-old Forde was convicted Feb. 14 of first-degree murder and other charges in the May 2009 home invasion in Arivaca, a desert community about 10 miles north of Mexico. Raul Flores, 29, and his 9-year-old daughter, Brisenia, were killed in the robbery.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors alleged Forde and her co-defendants, Jason Eugene Bush and Albert Robert Gaxiola, dressed as law enforcement officers and forced their way into the home, then shot Flores, his daughter and his wife, Gina Gonzalez, who survived her injuries after getting into a gun battle with the attackers.\par \par \uc2 Flores was believed to be involved with drug trafficking, police said, but officers don't think the assailants found much cash or drugs in the home.\par \par \uc2 A 911 recording released by the Pima County sheriff's office captured Gonzalez pleading for help after her husband and daughter were shot. She was heard crying out in pain from a gunshot wound then becoming frantic as the attackers returned. The sound of nine gunshots was heard as Gonzalez engaged the intruders.\par \par \uc2 Bush and Gaxiola will be tried in the case at a later date.\par \par \uc2 Forde, of Everett, Wash., had pleaded not guilty to two counts of first-degree murder and other charges stemming from the home invasion.\par \par \uc2 Forde's attorney, Eric Larsen, argued during the trial that Forde was never inside the home. Prosecutors disputed that contention, saying Forde was the ringleader of the operation and the law is clear.\par \par \uc2 "She didn't put a gun to Brisenia's head ... but she was the one in charge," Pima County prosecutor Rick Unklesbay told jurors. "Because of that you must hold her accountable."\par \par \uc2 Larsen said Forde talked big, but "frankly just didn't have the wherewithal to do this."\par \par \uc2 Pima County prosecutors would not comment Tuesday on the jury verdicts because of two pending trials.\par \par \uc2 Larsen would not comment when contacted Tuesday by The Associated Press.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110223e72n000ab\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHOENIX (AP) - A sweeping bill that targets illegal immigrants in public housing, public benefits and the workplace drew vocal opposition Tuesday from Democrats who say its sponsor is plotting his political strategy and not focused on Republicans' stated top priority, the economy.\par \par \uc2 "We should be thinking about turning around Arizona's economy, not running for higher office," said Sen. Richard Miranda of Tolleson, taking a swipe at what many believe is Republican Senate President Russell Pearce's interest when he leaves the Legislature. "Is this about fighting the drug cartels at the border or is it about blaming a group for all the state's problems?"\par \par \uc2 The Senate Appropriations Committee was considering the 29-page bill Tuesday, a day after it was introduced by Pearce, who authored last year's controversial SB 1070. That law touched off a nationwide debate on whether states can enforce federal immigration laws.\par \par \uc2 Democrats don't have the votes to block the measure, but the topic brought out supporters on both sides and security at the Senate was heightened, with about a dozen uniformed police officers deployed in and around the building.\par \par \uc2 Two other bills set for hearings Tuesday would challenge automatic U.S. citizenship for the children of illegal immigrants and require hospitals to confirm whether nonemergency patients are in the country legally.\par \par \uc2 Before the Appropriations Committee meeting, some of the officers outside the building stood between small groups of people who exchanged catcalls and jeers.\par \par \uc2 Police said four people were arrested and cited for disorderly conduct after disrupting a Democratic senator's news conference about her bill stiffening penalties for a human smuggling crime. Inside, officers cleared a packed hallway, directing people to a large room to watch a video feed of the hearing.\par \par \uc2 Pearce's bill toughens requirements that employers check work eligibility of new hires, allowing for their business licenses to be suspended it they don't use the federal E-Verify system. Workers caught using a false identity to get a job would face mandatory six-month jail sentences.\par \par \uc2 It also requires schools to collect information on the legal status of students and report them to law enforcement if their parents don't provide the necessary documents or the documents appear false.\par \par \uc2 The bill also makes it illegal for an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  to drive in the state, providing for a 30-day minimum jail sentence and the seizure of their vehicles if they are convicted.\par \par \uc2 In housing, it requires public agencies to verify the immigration status of renters and to evict everyone living in a unit if one was found to be an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . For health care, the bill changes some of the document requirements for the state's Medicaid program.\par \par \uc2 The medical industry opposes the hospital bill, arguing that immigrants with contagious diseases such as tuberculosis would avoid going to hospitals or clinic, putting themselves and the public at a grave health risk.\par \par \uc2 Sponsors of the citizenship bill hope it will prompt a court interpretation on an element of the 14th Amendment which guarantees citizenship to people born in the U.S. who are "subject to the jurisdiction" of this country. Supporters of the bill the amendment doesn't apply to the children of illegal immigrants because such families don't owe sole allegiance to the U.S.\par \par \uc2 Similar proposals have been introduced by lawmakers in Indiana, Mississippi, Texas, Oklahoma and South Dakota.\par \par \uc2 An accompanying proposal is an interstate compact that defines who is a U.S. citizen and asks states to issue separate birth certificates for those who are U.S. citizens and those who are not. Such a compact would have to be approved by Congress, but they do not require the president's signature.\par \par \uc2 Another Senate committee failed to advance the measure two weeks ago, and Pearce pulled the bill for a hearing in the Appropriations Committee, where it is more likely to win passage.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110222e72m002ce\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

To his surprise, Latino immigrants in New Bedford and across the state rallied to raise the other half.\par \par \uc2 Hildreth thought: Could Latino immigrant families also be inspired to raise money for college?\par \par \uc2 The result was the Boston-based group he founded: Families in Educational Leadership, or FUEL. For more than a year, his group has held "savings circles" in Chelsea, Lynn, and parts of Boston with the goal of training low-income immigrant families on financial literacy so they can put away money for college. The group promises that if families save $1,500 by the time a child graduates from high school, it will match that amount.\par \par \uc2 "I acted viscerally, from the gut," said Hildreth, now 60, who sold bonds in Latin America in the 1980s and 1990s. "I saw that these immigrants could raise money for bail, that they sent billions of dollars a year in remittances. Why not do the same for college?"\par \par \uc2 So far, according to FUEL officials, the group has signed up 260 immigrant families and hopes to expand to other Massachusetts cities. One of those to join was Felix Mendoza Chavez, a 57-year-old part-time janitor at Boston's Logan International Airport who used to believe college tuition would be forever out of reach for his two daughters.\par \par \uc2 But after joining Hildreth's program, the Salvadoran-born Chelsea resident said he "saves every extra dime that falls in front" of him. He attends workshops on saving, drops in on community meetings about scholarships, and has no problem pressing counselors about various colleges.\par \par \uc2 "He doesn't stop," said his 14-year-old daughter Carolina Aleman, a student at Northeast Metropolitan Regional Vocational School in Wakefield. "He's really hard on us now because he really believes we can do it."\par \par \uc2 In addition, the group brings to meetings college counselors, financial experts and current college students who are children of immigrants to speak about private and public money. "In a lot of cases, we can get them a full ride with money that is already out there," said Gene Miller, FUEL Chief Operating Officer.\par \par \uc2 Hildreth began his idea with a pilot program in Lynn for 12 students. The high school students, who went through workshops about looking for scholarships and family financial planning, earned 61 college acceptances and $2.6 million in local and national scholarships.\par \par \uc2 Since then, FUEL opened programs in Chelsea and Boston targeting low-income Latino, Haitian and Chinese immigrant families. The group also persuaded local business, banks and foundations to help fund its matched savings program for first-generation-to-college families.\par \par \uc2 Patricia Gandara, co-director of the Civil Rights Project at UCLA and co-author of "The Latino Education Crisis: The Consequences of Failed Social Policies," said she has heard of a number of programs across the country aimed at helping Latino immigrants get into college, but nothing like FUEL's matched savings program.\par \par \uc2 "There are many programs where funders step up and say, 'I'm going to pay for college tuition and tutoring.' that kind of thing," said Gandara. "But a match program like this is pretty unique."\par \par \uc2 Gandara said many Latino immigrant families know the importance of a U.S. college education, however, it is sometimes hard for the families to grasp how to plan for it financially because the educational systems in Latin America are so different. For example, she said in Mexico most stop their education at eighth grade because high schools charge tuition.\par \par \uc2 Hildreth said the belief that college is unobtainable is an idea he wants to change with the match program. He said he believes an expanded version of it, with federal Pell Grants, will do for recent Latino immigrants across the country what the G.I. Bill did for the education of Mexican Americans in Texas and California after World War II.\par \par \uc2 Hildreth said the group also is looking beyond Massachusetts. "I have a 10-year plan," said Hildreth. "And I plan to be in L.A. one day."\par \par \uc2 But for now FUEL officials were putting resources in Chelsea, a city of 37,000 next to Boston, where Latino students make up around 80 percent of the student population. More than 85 percent of the city's students are classified as "economically disadvantaged," according to schoolmatters.com, a website that lists education data from across the country.\par \par \uc2 During a recent workshop on scholarships, a Chelsea High School graduate spoke to parents about her experience at UMass-Boston and private scholarships. Parents closely listened and whispered to their children to translate.\par \par \uc2 "I don't like to miss out on anything," Chelsea resident Encarnacio Landaverde, 47, a mother of two college students and one in high school, said in Spanish. "Every bit of information is important."\par \par \uc2 Her son, Oscar Lainez, a 15-year-old Chelsea High School student, sat next to her and translated speeches.\par \par \uc2 Also attending was Chavez. After his first meeting, Chavez immediately put away $28 for daughter Carolina and $12 for his nine-year-old, Eileen Aleman. He vowed to put at least $25 a month in each account with the hopes of saving $1,500 for each when the girls graduate from high school.\par \par \uc2 Eileen, who wants to a teacher or a doctor, said he can't stop talking about it. "He wants us to become something in life," Eileen said. "Not a bathroom cleaner."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110220e72k001dy\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 DENVER (AP) - A Democratic proposal to let illegal immigrants pay in-state tuition at Colorado colleges received initial approval Thursday, but it still faces many hurdles before it becomes law, including a strong opposition in the Republican controlled House.\par \par \uc2 This is the fifth time Democrats have proposed letting \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students qualify for the lower-priced in-state tuition that Colorado residents receive, arguing that it will boost higher education coffers and help the state's economy over the long run.\par \par \uc2 "You have an investment in these young people," said Stephen Jordan, the president of the Metropolitan State College of Denver. "We need to stop thinking about what we have been spending on these children in grades K-12 as an expense, and rather think of it as an investment -- an investment in intellectual capital which will provide a return to our economy into the future."\par \par \uc2 The Senate Education committee approved the proposal on a 5-2 vote, with Republicans voting against it. While most testimony supported the bill, there were two organizations that voiced opposition. A representative of a group that opposes illegal immigration called for the committee's sergeants-at-arms to "clear the room of everyone but the public."\par \par \uc2 "I contend that the public would not include someone who is unauthorized to be in the state," said Stan Weekes, state director for Colorado Alliance for Immigration Reform, which opposes Senate Bill 126. Weekes said the bill would only benefit a small number of "unauthorized individuals."\par \par \uc2 Democrats say they've modified their proposal this year to make it more appealing to opponents, who argue illegal immigrants should not be getting state benefits.\par \par \uc2 Illegal immigrant\uc2  students would qualify for in-state tuition if they met certain criteria, such as attending a Colorado high school for at least three years and graduating from a state school. Sen. Angela Giron, a first-year lawmaker from Pueblo, said her proposal this year is different from previous bills because it requires that students sign an affidavit with a college saying they are trying to obtain legal residency, a provision that other states have included in their legislation.\par \par \uc2 California, Illinois, Kansas and Texas are among 11 states that grant in-state tuition to illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Giron's bill is also different from past attempts because it makes \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students ineligible for a state stipend that in-state tuition students can use at a college of their choice. That means illegal immigrants would still pay more than others who get in-state tuition. For example, illegal immigrants getting in-state tuition would pay $2,297 per semester for 12 credits at Metropolitan State College of Denver. But in-state students who get the state stipend, known as the College Opportunity Fund, pay $1,553. The rate for out-of-state students at the college is $6,727.\par \par \uc2 Republican Sen. Nancy Spence said she opposed the bill because of the false hope it would give to students with documentation who would not be able to get a job after graduating.\par \par \uc2 "Until they're legal in this country, I don't see what the advantage is to offering them false hope," she said.\par \par \uc2 The bill now goes to another Senate committee where Democrats have control but it will likely face a stiffer challenge in the House where Republicans have a majority. While Colorado Republicans have historically opposed the bill, the proposal has also failed in the past with help from Democrats.\par \par \uc2 Opponents of the legislation say providing in-state tuition to illegal immigrants will lead to higher operating costs at colleges and that it rewards illegal behavior.\par \par \uc2 Aminta Menjivar, a graduate of Littleton High School and a college student in Colorado, spoke to the committee Thursday, saying she was there on behalf of other undocumented students who could not attend. She said she spends times in high schools to encourage illegal immigrants to graduate from high school and attend college.\par \par \uc2 "Because I want to them to achieve their dreams and to contribute positively to our economy and our society," she said.\par \par \uc2 Democratic Sen. Michael Johnston, the measure's co-sponsor, said Menjivar was the only student to speak over fears that other students could be reported to immigration authorities if they signed up to testify. Johnston said that happened two years ago when another version of the in-state tuition bill was in the Legislature.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110218e72i0008z\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PIERRE, S.D. (AP) - A South Dakota legislative panel Thursday passed a proposal to make it a crime to hire an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , one of several state bills this year stemming from the national immigration debate.\par \par \uc2 If the bill becomes law, anyone who knowingly employs an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  would face a fine up to $1,000 for the first offense, with possible jail time for future offenses.\par \par \uc2 The Senate Judiciary Committee voted 4-3 to approve the measure. It now moves to the full Senate.\par \par \uc2 Supporters say South Dakota -- which by one estimate has about 2,000 illegal immigrants -- should take action now to avoid problems caused by immigration in the future.\par \par \uc2 "Should we wait until there is a big problem?" asked Sen. Tim Begalka, R-Clear Lake. "The time to shut the door is before the horse gets out."\par \par \uc2 Others said they weren't convinced the bill was necessary and didn't have enough information to support it.\par \par \uc2 "We're controlling their destiny," said Sen. Jean Hunhoff, R-Yankton. "We don't know what's going on."\par \par \uc2 The committee removed sections from the bill that would have forbidden state residents from transporting or helping to conceal someone they knew was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . Another part that was removed would have made it a crime to "encourage or induce an unauthorized alien to come to or reside in this state."\par \par \uc2 The bill exempts employers who attempt to check an employee's immigration status by filing federal forms or using the federal E-Verify program.\par \par \uc2 The bill's sponsor, Sen. Craig Tieszen, R-Rapid City, said it would not hurt businesses "who are doing their best work, trying hard to follow the law, to employ legal citizens and legal immigrants."\par \par \uc2 South Dakota joins other states in considering bills this year that deal with illegal immigrants. A bill that failed this week would have directed police to check a suspect's immigration status if they have reason to believe that person is here illegally, a bill emulating laws passed by Arizona last year.\par \par \uc2 Lawmakers have also defeated another bill that would have required that a child born in the United States is a citizen only if at least one parent is a U.S. citizen or legal immigrant. Opponents say such a bill would violate the U.S. Constitution's 14th Amendment.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110217e72h001pu\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 NEW YORK (AP) - In a film where sound is central, Alexandre Desplat's score to "The King's Speech" enters subtly.\par \par \uc2 A simple melody slinks in, a soft, demure line of hopeful piano notes, fittingly repetitive, like the stuttering speech of the film's main character, George VI (Colin Firth).\par \par \uc2 "You have to respect the silence," says Desplat, speaking from London where he's working on the score to "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2." "It's quite a challenge to be able to come in in such a delicate way that you're not noticed. I think great scores have to be noticed, but they're wrong when you hear the music come in."\par \par \uc2 The score, partly recorded with a vintage microphone of George VI's, has earned Desplat his fourth Academy Award nomination. He's regarded as the front-runner in the category ahead of the Feb. 27 Oscars.\par \par \uc2 A win would be something of a belated coronation for Desplat. Though it wasn't until 2003 that he broke through to Hollywood, the 49-year-old Frenchman has already established himself as one of the most sought after composers in movies.\par \par \uc2 His scores are remarkably varied, veering from grandly epic to minimalist and intimate, from 80-piece orchestras to lone whistling. He's worked with Stephen Frears, Roman Polanski, David Fincher, Wes Anderson and Jacques Audiard.\par \par \uc2 "The sound of the music and the images, to me, is something intangible and magical," says Desplat. "I try to sneak into the film with the music, so that it belongs to the film totally."\par \par \uc2 The son of a French father and Greek mother who met in the U.S. but raised him in France, Desplat was classically trained on piano from age 5. He also became proficient on the flute and trumpet.\par \par \uc2 He was a young cinephile. At age 6, he recalls being struck by Alex North's score to "Spartacus."\par \par \uc2 "I never dreamed of writing for concert or opera," says Desplat. "I always dreamed, if I was a composer, to write music for films."\par \par \uc2 He was particularly moved by scores by Nino Rota, Bernard Herrmann, fellow Frenchman Maurice Jarre ("Lawrence of Arabia") and John Williams, whose "Star Wars" score -- its double album poured over -- prompted a resolution in Desplat.\par \par \uc2 "I remember saying to my friends: `That's what I want to do,'" says Desplat.\par \par \uc2 He began scoring film and television around 1990, working mainly in France. Dialogue-heavy French films, Desplat says, didn't give him the room he craved. 2003's "Girl with a Pearl Earring" introduced him to Hollywood.\par \par \uc2 Jonathan Glazer's "Birth" (2004) bent yet more ears to Desplat, particularly its magnificent opening scene: An overhead shot of a jogger running through a snowy Central Park, who eventually collapses and dies. Paced by flute, Desplat's score is lush and stirring -- somewhat like minimalist John Adams, a distinct influence on Desplat.\par \par \uc2 Anderson was blown away by the "Birth" score and sought out Desplat for his stop-motion animated "Fantastic Mr. Fox." Desplat's whimsical score has bluegrass influences and pieces like "Whack-Bat Majorette."\par \par \uc2 "Alexandre is a French movie star who happens to be one of the world's pre-eminent composers," Anderson said by e-mail. "I do not know if he can act. Also, I feel he may be the flute-playing equivalent of Jimi Hendrix, and he is a great whistler."\par \par \uc2 For Desplat, scoring a film is a deeply personal task. He holes himself away "like a monk" when writing, pushing himself into "a very obsessive trance." Watching footage from the film endlessly, inspiration can come from anything: the storyline, an actor's face, a camera angle, a lighting style.\par \par \uc2 "When I think I have found what the music should be, I can feel a vibration as I'm playing the music and watching at the same time," Desplat says. "If you change the music of `Vertigo,' I'm sure the vibration would go away."\par \par \uc2 For "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," a film in which the main character ages backward, he created musical palindromes. In "New Moon," he reflected Bella's indecision between her two suitors (Edward and Jacob) by blending their themes.\par \par \uc2 Chris Weitz has worked with Desplat on three very different films: "New Moon," the fantasy epic "The Golden Compass" and the upcoming \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  drama "A Better Life." He convenes with Desplat at his Montparnasse apartment in Paris, which includes a studio.\par \par \uc2 "It's kind of sinfully fun," says Weitz. "You're sitting around, every once in a while a cat will wander in and take a seat on the couch. You sit around and talk about the day and life and eat biscuits and sip coffee."\par \par \uc2 "You get the sense that you're both trying to improve the movie, rather than just knocking around notes," says Weitz.\par \par \uc2 Desplat was particularly challenged in scoring the much-anticipated "The Tree of Life" (out in May), by the rarely active Terrence Malick. On Malick's wishes, Desplat composed the score without seeing any of the footage, providing music to the director for several years.\par \par \uc2 It's all an incredible load for any composer, especially one as dedicated as Desplat.\par \par \uc2 "It's a very, very lucky moment and I don't want to stop that moment," says Desplat. "It's what I dreamed to do, and I want to keep the dream going."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110217e72h001if\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The Argus Leader. Feb. 15, 2011\par \par \uc2 It's time for conversation about priorities\par \par \uc2 For decades, the Dakotas have received more money from the federal government than it has contributed, especially compared to more densely populated areas of the country.\par \par \uc2 That largesse, particularly in South Dakota's case, partly reflects the strength of congressional representation throughout the years by delegations who have worked diligently to direct money here.\par \par \uc2 However, changing times indicate that South Dakotans no longer can expect the same level of federal money to reach this state. The intensifying push to reduce federal spending means that deep cuts in the federal budget could come, and the state's reliance on federal money indicates that those cuts will hit particularly hard here.\par \par \uc2 South Dakotans must begin prioritizing which federally assisted projects and services are best to keep - and which we are willing to concede.\par \par \uc2 As the national budget debate unfolds, some funding issues that are important to the state, but vulnerable to cuts, already are rising to the top. Farm and ethanol subsidies, an assortment of money that goes to Indian Country, the Lewis & Clark Regional Water System, and the DUSEL project at the former \uc2 Homestake Gold\uc2  Mine are in that mix, among others.\par \par \uc2 It's safe to say that not everything will make the cut. Still, choices must be made judiciously.\par \par \uc2 South Dakota's most critical needs must not be swept away in a political frenzy that could eliminate the right kind of spending.\par \par \uc2 To that end, the state's residents will be the ones who must set South Dakota's new federal funding priorities.\par \par \uc2 And that conversation needs to happen sooner rather than later so that our congressional delegation can advocate for them as the national debate continues.\par \par \uc2 --------\par \par \uc2 Aberdeen American News. Feb. 10, 2011\par \par \uc2 Early voting should be encouraged\par \par \uc2 We all agree that voting is one of the essential ingredients for our democracy.\par \par \uc2 We also are aware that voter turnout is never as high as it could or should be.\par \par \uc2 That's why we think the recent trend toward early voting is so important, and why government should encourage it as much as possible.\par \par \uc2 South Dakota's Legislature is wrestling with this issue right now. The idea of defining a period for voting for the whole state is a good one. Now, early voting can vary by county, which can make the system confusing for voters and possibly unfair for candidates running state- or district-wide.\par \par \uc2 The House is in favor of legislation that would start early voting 46 days before the primary or general election. The Senate, instead, is looking at beginning 29 days prior to the election.\par \par \uc2 Either solution is appropriate, though we lean toward a longer voting period.\par \par \uc2 Too often, citizens find excuses to avoid voting. It might be work, or school, or the weather. Sadly, during "off-year" elections, many residents feel that voting might even be a waste of time.\par \par \uc2 Having more options to vote can only increase engagement. Absentee voting has long been a great way to be sure everyone eligible has a chance to vote, no matter the circumstances. Early voting is an extension of that service.\par \par \uc2 Making voting more local and more available is a great way to go. Rather than forced into long lines at a designated precinct in November, we think more folks would be apt to vote at their convenience, perhaps even at satellite voting centers set up in stores or the mall.\par \par \uc2 As the world is becoming more user-friendly -- on-demand, when you want it -- our system of elections should take note.\par \par \uc2 Sen. Tim Begalka, R-Clear Lake, one of the sponsors of the Senate bill, would like to tighten the voting period.\par \par \uc2 "My contention is it's gotten too long," he was quoted as saying in the American News. "Election Day used to be a big deal ... It's kind of gotten cheapened."\par \par \uc2 Though we can sympathize with Begalka's concern, we don't see this as a "cheapening" of Election Day. That is still the day most will cast their votes, and the day when the important task of counting all votes actually takes place.\par \par \uc2 More at issue for us is access to the actual process of voting.\par \par \uc2 Of course, with early voting comes more responsibility. A lot can happen in a campaign over the course of a month, so voters will need to make themselves even more informed if they choose to vote early.\par \par \uc2 In addition, laws should be clear about what happens if an early voter tries to vote twice, or if a voter casts their ballot and passes away before Election Day proper.\par \par \uc2 Most importantly, as voters cast their ballots in the weeks leading up to the count, we must guard against any results being released early, as that could have a devastating impact on the election if voters knew which way the election was going before the race was finished.\par \par \uc2 --------------------\par \par \uc2 Rapid City Journal. Feb. 13, 2011\par \par \uc2 Wilder's bison have suffered enough\par \par \uc2 As home to one of the few genetically pure herds of bison at Wind Cave National Park, and one of the largest publicly-owned herds at Custer State Park, South Dakota has an affection for the animal that borders on reverence.\par \par \uc2 That's why it's sickening to hear about the herd of more than 4,000 bison apparently left to starve on Maurice Wilder's ranch headquartered in Corson County, S.D.\par \par \uc2 Even more sickening is the fact that Wilder -- a wealthy Florida real estate mogul -- has received more than $2.3 million in farm subsidies since 2005 for various land holdings, including $108,000 for the Corson County ranch.\par \par \uc2 This isn't the first time Wilder's neglect has gotten him into trouble with government authorities. Two years ago the ranch was monitored to make sure Wilder was properly caring for the bison after starving animals were found roaming in search of food.\par \par \uc2 This year, the situation is worse, according to Corson County Sheriff Keith Gall, who has been visiting the ranch every day to make sure the bison have adequate hay and water.\par \par \uc2 More than a dozen bison have been found dead. Others have broken legs.\par \par \uc2 The animals have been impounded pending a court decision to return the bison to Wilder, reassign ownership, or sell them at a public auction.\par \par \uc2 Any leniency Wilder was shown in the past should not be repeated. This is not a case of a man of modest means struggling to maintain a ranch in tough times.\par \par \uc2 It can better be described as a man of means walking off with public tax dollars meant to feed the animals he left to starve.\par \par \uc2 Just because the bison weren't under Wilder's direct care is no excuse.\par \par \uc2 It's his ranch. They're his animals. He's ultimately responsible for their proper care.\par \par \uc2 Wilder is a repeat offender who had ample warning and opportunity to properly care for the bison. His failure to do that makes returning them to his care an option that should be ruled out.\par \par \uc2 He also should be required to cover the state's costs for stepping in to do a job he should have done himself.\par \par \uc2 The state should do everything within its power to make sure this never happens again.\par \par \uc2 Wilder has proven -- not once, but twice -- that he's not fit for the job.\par \par \uc2 His animals have suffered enough and should be turned over to people who can properly care for them.\par \par \uc2 Some of the government officials involved in this case also let the animals down.\par \par \uc2 The sheriff described it as a "bad situation that should have been corrected a long time ago."\par \par \uc2 Stronger laws, strict enforcement and tougher judges could have avoided a replay of this tragedy.\par \par \uc2 The case also highlights a need for better oversight of how farm subsidies are used.\par \par \uc2 Wilder's reprehensible abuse of the system reflects poorly on others who deserve farm subsidies and spend the money wisely.\par \par \uc2 ------------------\par \par \uc2 Watertown Public Opinion. Feb. 14, 2011\par \par \uc2 Cell phones have a place\par \par \uc2 Last Thursday (Feb. 10), the South Dakota Senate passed a bill that would ban motorists from texting while driving. The bill, however, does allow drivers to continue using cell phones while behind the wheel of a car.\par \par \uc2 Sen. Craig Tieszen, R-Rapid City, the prime sponsor of the bill, said the average amount of distraction time for a driver while texting is four seconds. He said the legislation he proposed is needed because doing nothing will not make the problem any better.\par \par \uc2 Many companies, the Public Opinion included, have a policy against texting while driving. There is also a policy against operating a cell phone while driving unless it employs a hands-free device. While we agree with Tieszen's bill, we can't help but wonder why it didn't include language prohibiting using a hand-held cell phone while driving. Dialing a phone number, or looking for one in a contact list, can be just as distracting as texting.\par \par \uc2 We're not against cell phone use in a car by any means. On the contrary, considering some of the lonely stretches of road in South Dakota and the distances between communities, they are valuable safety devices. But like most things, there is a time and a place to use them.\par \par \uc2 A driver's main responsibility while behind the wheel of a moving vehicle is to operate it safely and pay attention to not only what he or she is doing but also to what other drivers are doing. Fumbling with a cell phone, even for a second, hampers that effort.\par \par \uc2 There are plenty of ways cell phones can be used in a moving car. Like we said, a hands-free device is one way and so is having a passenger place the call. If the driver must talk to the other person, the call can be put on speaker phone. If a driver is alone and needs to make a call, simply pull over, make the call and remain there until it is completed.\par \par \uc2 Cell phones are valuable tools for business and personal use. The key is to use them properly and safely. If texting while driving is considered too much of a distraction, then shouldn't dialing a cell phone or searching for a contact number fall into that same category?\par \par \uc2 Like we said, cell phones are a valuable tool for motorists. They're best used, however, when done so safely and texting or calling while behind the wheel of a moving vehicle does not fall into that category.\par \par \uc2 ------------------\par \par \uc2 The Madison Daily Leader. Feb. 10, 2011\par \par \uc2 Compelling testimony may help pass no-texting bill\par \par \uc2 After listening to legislative testimony by Miss South Dakota Loren Vaillancourt, we believe a bill that would outlaw texting while driving will pass without much resistance.\par \par \uc2 Vaillancourt has made the prevention of distracted driving her platform during her reign as Miss South Dakota. Her brother was killed in a car crash caused by a texting driver.\par \par \uc2 Her testimony, which is still available for viewing on the South Dakota Public Broadcasting website, was powerful, and we believe legislators were swayed. The bill moved out of the Senate Judiciary Committee by a 6-1 vote. It now goes to the full Senate.\par \par \uc2 Others testified in favor of the bill and also influenced legislators. But Vaillancourt's choice of words and passion were extremely effective. "I hope you understand the magnitude of this issue and the lives that could be saved if this bill is passed," she said.\par \par \uc2 Only one person testified against the bill, a representative of the South Dakota Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. He said the measure would not stop all distracted driving. Rather than making texting while driving a crime, the Legislature should instead encourage parents to use programs that would prevent their kids' phones from texting while moving more than 10 mph. His testimony was not compelling.\par \par \uc2 The measure would make it a Class 2 misdemeanor, carrying a penalty of up to 30 days in jail and a $500 fine, for a driver to compose, read or send an electronic text message while operating a vehicle. The ban also would apply when someone is stopped at an intersection.\par \par \uc2 The bill would not prohibit the use of cell phones for voice calls. Exemptions are allowed for texting in an emergency, while legally parked or while using voice-operated or hands-free technology.\par \par \uc2 At least 30 states have already banned texting while driving, and we believe more are to come. We're eager to see South Dakota pass this measure.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 The Daily Republic. Feb. 16, 2011\par \par \uc2 Immigration bill deserved support from legislators\par \par \uc2 South Dakota lawmakers this week missed an opportunity to make a statement about illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 A bill by Rep. Manny Steele, R-Sioux Falls, would have directed law officers enforcing other laws to make reasonable attempts to ascertain a suspect's immigration status, if there is reason to believe that person is in the United States illegally. The bill also would have made it illegal to transport or hide an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  or to encourage an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  to come to South Dakota.\par \par \uc2 Steele's reasoning was sound. He said he wants to protect South Dakotans from crimes committed by illegal aliens. He also worries about the costs that result from processing crimes committed by those who are in the state illegally.\par \par \uc2 The bill was the subject of rather passionate debate before being voted down 11-2 by the House State Affairs Committee. Among those arguing against the proposal was Mike Levsen, the mayor of Aberdeen, who said the plan would divert police from other duties.\par \par \uc2 We don't get it. Illegal immigrants are just that -- illegal. Why not make relatively simple efforts to try to curb their law breaking?\par \par \uc2 According to some estimates, there are between 10 million and 20 million people in this country illegally. Their presence can drain public funds, since they sometimes cannot pay for health care or for court costs that arise if they break the law.\par \par \uc2 While we have no problem with legal immigration, we grow frustrated that few people want to really get to the root of the problems associated with illegal entry into this country.\par \par \uc2 The way we understand it, the proposed bill this week before the South Dakota Legislature only would have directed officers to ask a person suspected of breaking a law about his immigration status. That doesn't seem like much of a drain on public resources, especially considering the money it could save taxpayers in the long run.\par \par \uc2 Laws that focus on illegal immigration are touchy, and we acknowledge that. But as people tend to throw about accusations of racism, it's a simple fact that illegal immigrants are flowing into the United States and nobody seems to be doing anything about it.\par \par \uc2 We appreciate Steele's proposal and those who testified in favor of it. They are realists who want to help solve a real problem in this country.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110217e72h001hm\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 RICHMOND, Va. (AP) - Bills to ban illegal immigrants from entering Virginia's colleges and universities or receiving public aid and to crack down on those who commit crimes met swift defeat Wednesday in a Senate subcommittee.\par \par \uc2 A handful of legislators on the Senate Courts of Justice subcommittee rushed through a dozen anti-\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  bills passed by the House of Delegates, killing all but two. Most died without a motion, while others were defeated on 3-2 votes.\par \par \uc2 Impassioned pleas on both sides were cut short as legislators hurried to return to floor sessions on the deadline to get bills with impacts on revenue into conference.\par \par \uc2 The outcome of most of the bills went as it has for several years.\par \par \uc2 Del. Christopher Peace's bill to require colleges to have written policies explicitly denying enrollment to people who are in the United States illegally is identical to measures that have failed before the committee for several years.\par \par \uc2 "Unlike wine, it isn't getting any better with age," Senate Majority Leader Richard Saslaw, D-Fairfax, said of the proposal.\par \par \uc2 Federal law prohibits undocumented students from paying in-state tuition or receiving federal aid, but they can still pursue a public college education. Virginia's public institutions have varying policies regarding whether to admit illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 "At the end of the day, it's a decision between whether you want people to have jobs at Waffle House or as a scientist or a biologist," said Joshua Collins, a lobbyist for the Laborers' International Union of North America.\par \par \uc2 Del. Jackson Miller, R-Manassas, countered that they wouldn't be able to get either job because they are in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 "Why are we giving them the education if they can't get the jobs anyway?" Miller asked.\par \par \uc2 The panel also killed Del. Todd Gilbert's bill that would have required local school divisions to collect data on the number of students enrolled in English as a Second Language courses and report such data to the state Board of Education. The bill also would require school divisions to report the number of students whose parents are unable to provide their children's birth certificates when they enroll.\par \par \uc2 Although Gilbert said the figures might not give the exact number of children of illegal immigrants who are being educated in Virginia's schools, but it would arm lawmakers with data regarding "the exact degree to which that is impacting the taxpayers of Virginia."\par \par \uc2 "We just want to be able to make the case to the feds that they are costing us a whole bunch of money and they need to fix their system," said Gilbert, R-Shenandoah.\par \par \uc2 The U.S. Supreme Court has said children must be given K-12 education regardless of their residency status.\par \par \uc2 Another bill that was defeated would have required localities to verify that people are legal U.S. residents before providing them state or local public assistance, except for what is mandated by federal law. The legislation also allowed for withholding state funding to agencies or localities that fail to do so.\par \par \uc2 Several bills requiring state or local police to collect data on those who are arrested or perform federal immigration law enforcement duties also failed.\par \par \uc2 "Today has been a great day for us," said Edgar Aranda-Yanoc, chairman of the Virginia Coalition of Latino Organizations. "We are relieved, but of course we have to work more to get good legislation."\par \par \uc2 The panel approved bills to revoke the driver's licenses of those who are deported and require state contractors to check workers residency status through the free federal e-Verify system.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110217e72h0002k\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 A couple of years ago, Liam Neeson starred as a former CIA agent in "Taken," searching for his kidnapped daughter and kicking as much butt as necessary to find her.\par \par \uc2 Now, he's continuing this fascinating late-career path, remaining in action-star mode as he creeps ever closer to 60, in "Unknown." It's a chilly little thriller about amnesia, mistrust and lost identity, with the kinds of chases and explosions you've seen countless times before. Interchangeable Euro baddies lurk in the shadows, seemingly omniscient and omnipresent, waiting to strike. Nothing and no one is what it seems, which makes the unpredictability somewhat more predictable.\par \par \uc2 Still, Neeson's always-intelligent screen presence, his nuance and gravitas, help elevate "Unknown" beyond its preposterous elements. And he gets great help from a classy supporting cast, including Frank Langella, Bruno Ganz and Sebastian Koch.\par \par \uc2 And, to be fair, the film from Spanish director Jaume Collet-Serra has its suspenseful moments, including the startling, precisely staged car accident that sends Neeson's character on his dangerous journey. Collet-Serra's last film was "Orphan," about a creepy 9-year-old girl who wreaks havoc on her unsuspecting adoptive family. "Unknown," which Oliver Butcher and Stephen Cornwell wrote based on a novel by Didier van Cauwelaert, doesn't have anything even remotely resembling the gnarly, jaw-dropping twist of that earlier film, but it's got some surprises here and there, and it ought to keep you guessing for a while.\par \par \uc2 Neeson's character, botanist Dr. Martin Harris, has plenty of his own guessing to do. He's traveled to Berlin for a scientific conference with his beautiful wife, Elizabeth (January Jones), but soon after they arrive at their luxurious hotel, he realizes he's left his briefcase -- with their passports -- at the airport. When he hops in a cab and dashes back to retrieve it, a chain-reaction crash sends the car skidding through the streets and off a bridge into a river. The driver (Diane Kruger, vaguely de-glammed) pulls him from the vehicle, saves his life, then runs off. Martin, meanwhile, is taken to a hospital, where he lies in a coma for four days.\par \par \uc2 When he awakens, he has only vague memories of who he is; against a doctor's orders, he hurries back to the hotel to find Elizabeth. Not only does she look him in the eye and insist she has no idea who he is, but she's there with an entirely different man (Aidan Quinn) who says he's Dr. Martin Harris -- and he has the passport to prove it. (Then again, Jones has the kind of icy, blonde good looks that Hitchcock often favored, so you know there's more to her than meets the eye.)\par \par \uc2 From here, Martin goes on a quest to piece together what happened. He seeks out the cab driver, whom he learns is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  named Gina, hoping she can provide some clues as to who he is and where he was going. Ganz, the veteran star of such films as "Nosferatu the Vampyre" and "Wings of Desire," is deeply eerie as a former Stasi agent Martin hires to help him investigate his identity. He adds a feeling of menace even though he's a good guy, and his confrontation with Langella, as a colleague of Martin's who's come to Berlin supposedly to help, crackles with tension.\par \par \uc2 As Martin and Gina evade one attack after another from the mysterious people who are out to get them, he discovers all kinds of useful skills he never knew he had. And as "Unknown" reveals itself, you may discover that it reminds you of another, superior movie -- one that we will not name here for fear of giving away the twist. But Collet-Serra makes the story move with enough style and energy that you also may not care.\par \par \uc2 "Unknown," a Warner Bros. Pictures release, is rated PG-13 for some intense sequences of violence and action, and brief sexual content. Running time: 106 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Motion Picture Association of America rating definitions:\par \par \uc2 G -- General audiences.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 BROCKTON, Mass. (AP) - Investigators want to question an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  with a violent criminal record who fled the United States for his native Ecuador just hours after the bodies of a woman and her toddler son were found in a trash bin near their home, prosecutors said Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 Luis Guaman, who also went by the names Antonio Castro and Segundo Castro, was one of the last people seen with the victims before they were found dead in Brockton, a city of about 100,000 residents just south of Boston, prosecutors said.\par \par \uc2 Ecuadorean immigrant Maria Avelina Palaguachi-Cela, 25, and her son, Brian Palaguachi, 2, were killed by blows to the head. Police found the mother's body stuffed in a duffel bag in the trash container on Sunday night after receiving an anonymous tip. The boy's body was found near hers.\par \par \uc2 The mother and son were killed near the trash bin, Plymouth District Attorney Timothy Cruz said. No one has been charged with the killings.\par \par \uc2 Witnesses told investigators that Guaman took his belongings and left the apartment building he shared with the victims and another tenant over the weekend, before the bodies were discovered, Cruz said.\par \par \uc2 Investigators believe Guaman bought a ticket for a Monday morning flight to Ecuador on Friday or Saturday. Authorities do not believe that the woman and her son were alive at that time, Cruz said.\par \par \uc2 "We have information that only 2 1/2 hours after the bodies of Maria and her son were discovered in a Dumpster, a man using the name of Segundo Castro left this country on a flight from JFK Airport to Ecuador," Cruz said.\par \par \uc2 The U.S. has no extradition treaty with Ecuador, Cruz said.\par \par \uc2 "We intend to reach out to anybody that we possibly can to help us to talk to the Ecuadorean authorities, especially in light of the fact that the people who were murdered in this case are Ecuadorean themselves," he said.\par \par \uc2 Cruz declined to confirm reports that a love triangle involving the woman, the father of her son and Guaman might have complicated relationships in the apartment.\par \par \uc2 "All I can say is a 2-year-old boy is dead," Cruz said. "What's that got to do with a love triangle?"\par \par \uc2 Efforts to track down Guaman have been complicated by the fact that there are no records of him entering the United States legally, Cruz said.\par \par \uc2 "This has been, to some extent, like chasing ghosts," Cruz said. "You are trying to find people who don't have the appropriate paperwork here."\par \par \uc2 Still, investigators have determined that Guaman has a violent criminal history in the United States under the three aliases authorities are aware of. This includes a pending warrant out of Milford for a 2007 assault and battery and two felony warrants out of New York for kidnapping with malice and assault, Cruz said.\par \par \uc2 Guaman also has a pending case in the Brockton District Court for assault with a dangerous weapon, Cruz said.\par \par \uc2 The FBI has been involved in the investigation.\par \par \uc2 In a related development, a judge ordered a man who lives in the apartment building be held on $50,000 cash bail on a charge of misleading police investigating the killings.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110216e72g0023r\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ATLANTA (AP) - A legislative committee in Georgia voted Tuesday to approve a bill that would bar illegal immigrants from attending its state colleges or universities.\par \par \uc2 The House Higher Education committee, in a voice vote with no roll call, approved the bill proposed by Rep. Tom Rice, a Norcross Republican. The bill now moves to the House Rules committee, which will decide when and if it gets a full House vote.\par \par \uc2 Rice said the legislation is necessary to keep an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from taking the place of any citizen or legal resident.\par \par \uc2 "That's the real issue, should somebody really be here to take the spot of somebody who is here legally in the university system?" Rice said.\par \par \uc2 University System of Georgia Chancellor Erroll Davis testified that the system isn't overrun by illegal immigrants and such students aren't taking the place of citizens and legal residents. He also said that \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students more than pay for the cost of their education because they are required to pay out-of-state tuition.\par \par \uc2 The Regents examined the issue last summer in the wake of concerns voiced over a high-profile case involving an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  and Kennesaw State University student threatened with deportation after an arrest in March. Ultimately, federal immigration authorities delayed action on her case for a year to allow her to finish her education.\par \par \uc2 The Regents found that, out of about 311,000 students enrolled in the systems 35 colleges and universities in the fall, 501 were "undocumented students." That's less than two-tenths of a percent. Davis stressed that "undocumented" does not necessarily mean illegal, it could also mean someone who doesn't have their proper papers in order.\par \par \uc2 Davis said a new rule adopted in October that prohibits University System of Georgia schools that have rejected any academically qualified applicants in the two most recent academic years from accepting \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  applicants means that illegal immigrants aren't taking spots from citizens and legal residents.\par \par \uc2 Rice said the bill is merely adding postsecondary education to a list of public benefits that illegal immigrants are not entitled to receive.\par \par \uc2 D.A. King, founder of the Dustin Inman Society, which advocates tougher immigration enforcement measures, said that federal law already classifies postsecondary education as a public benefit that illegal immigrants are ineligible for.\par \par \uc2 Davis, the university system chancellor, said federal officials have told him that's not the case and that he is using that and the policy of 48 other states as a guideline. South Carolina is the only state that currently bars illegal immigrants from attending state colleges and universities.\par \par \uc2 Tonna Harris-Bosselmann, who teaches English as a second language at Gainesville State College, was one of several speakers who urged the committee not to pass the bill.\par \par \uc2 "When you academically disenfranchise a segment of the population, who wins? Nobody does," she said.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110216e72g0007b\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

They now will hear several days of mitigating evidence from defense attorneys on why Shawna Forde's life should be spared.\par \par \uc2 The 42-year-old Forde was convicted Monday on two counts of first-degree murder and other charges in the May 2009 home invasion in Arivaca (ayr-uh-VAH'-kuh), a desert community about 10 miles north of Mexico. Killed in the robbery were 29-year-old Raul Flores and his 9-year-old daughter Brisenia.\par \par \uc2 Forde is the leader of the Minutemen American Defense, a small border watch group. Prosecutors say she planned the attack to help fund its anti-immigrant operations.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110215e72f002x5\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ATLANTA (AP) - A legislative committee in Georgia voted Tuesday to approve a bill that would bar illegal immigrants from attending its state college or universities.\par \par \uc2 The House Higher Education committee, in a voice vote with no roll call, approved the bill proposed by Rep. Tom Rice, a Norcross Republican. The bill now moves to the House Rules committee, which will decide when and if it gets a full House vote.\par \par \uc2 Rice said the legislation is necessary to keep an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from taking the place of any citizen or legal resident.\par \par \uc2 "That's the real issue, should somebody really be here to take the spot of somebody who is here legally in the university system?" Rice said.\par \par \uc2 University System of Georgia Chancellor Erroll Davis testified that the system isn't overrun by illegal immigrants and such students aren't taking the place of citizens and legal residents. He also said that \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students more than pay for the cost of their education because they are required to pay out-of-state tuition.\par \par \uc2 The Regents examined the issue last summer in the wake of concerns voiced over a high-profile case involving an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  and Kennesaw State University student threatened with deportation after an arrest in March. Ultimately, federal immigration authorities delayed action on her case for a year to allow her to finish her education.\par \par \uc2 The Regents found that, out of about 311,000 students enrolled in the systems 35 colleges and universities in the fall, 501 were "undocumented students." That's less than two-tenths of a percent. Davis stressed that "undocumented" does not necessarily mean illegal, it could also mean someone who doesn't have their proper papers in order.\par \par \uc2 Davis said a new rule adopted in October that prohibits University System of Georgia schools that have rejected any academically qualified applicants in the two most recent academic years from accepting \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  applicants means that illegal immigrants aren't taking spots from citizens and legal residents.\par \par \uc2 Rice said the bill is merely adding postsecondary education to a list of public benefits that illegal immigrants are not entitled to receive.\par \par \uc2 D.A. King, founder of the Dustin Inman Society, which advocates tougher immigration enforcement measures, said that federal law already classifies postsecondary education as a public benefit that illegal immigrants are ineligible for.\par \par \uc2 Davis, the university system chancellor, said federal officials have told him that's not the case and that he is using that and the policy of 48 other states as a guideline. South Carolina is the only state that currently bars illegal immigrants from attending state colleges and universities.\par \par \uc2 Tonna Harris-Bosselmann, who teaches English as a second language at Gainesville State College, was one of several speakers who urged the committee not to pass the bill.\par \par \uc2 "When you academically disenfranchise a segment of the population, who wins? Nobody does," she said.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110215e72f002sr\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 HELENA, Mont. (AP) - Legislative committees heard several more Republican-sponsored bills Tuesday that aim to keep illegal immigrants out of the state.\par \par \uc2 One bill would require employers to check workers' immigration status. Another tries to prevent Montana cities from becoming \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  sanctuaries. They are among several policies being endorsed by lawmakers who say they need to protect employers and stop illegal immigrants from taking Montanans' jobs.\par \par \uc2 Opponents, however, say the measures are burdensome and unnecessary because Montana doesn't have the same immigrant population issues as other areas of the country.\par \par \uc2 The House Business and Labor Committee heard a bill that would require employers to check workers' status through a federal database. House Bill 440 would suspend business licenses for businesses that don't use the database called E-Verify. Another bill would require the use of E-Verify before issuing a driver's license.\par \par \uc2 Supporters said illegal aliens are a growing problem in Montana and the E-Verify system would deter illegal immigrants from applying for jobs and make it easier for businesses to employ legal workers.\par \par \uc2 "This to me is a way to level the playing field for all employers," said Bob Winger, president of the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers in Helena.\par \par \uc2 Those opposed to the E-Verify requirement said the system is an unnecessary government regulation of businesses. Critics also said the database subjects Montanans to undue federal scrutiny.\par \par \uc2 "It poses unacceptable threats to American workers' privacy rights by increasing the risk of data surveillance and identify theft," said Scott Crichton, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Montana.\par \par \uc2 Another opponent included an E-Verify user who said the database is cumbersome and difficult to use.\par \par \uc2 "I can tell you from experience this system is not user-friendly," said Willie Duffield, who runs a Montana trucking company.\par \par \uc2 Also Tuesday, House Bill 492 was proposed in the House Judiciary Committee as an effort to ensure local governments don't mimic policies in other states where police don't report illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 A number of cities such as San Francisco and Los Angeles have such sanctuary policies, which protect illegal immigrants by not funding or allowing enforcement of federal immigration laws.\par \par \uc2 Republican Rep. David Howard of Park City, who is carrying the bill, said states with sanctuary policies are violating the rule of law and discriminating against legal citizens. He said Montanans will lose jobs to illegal immigrants if they aren't reported to the federal government, and it's important to block such problems ahead of time.\par \par \uc2 "The trouble is when you know you have a problem it's too late," Howard said.\par \par \uc2 Those opposing the measure said the issue isn't a pertinent one in Montana, which doesn't have such sanctuary cities and doesn't have the same immigrant population issues as other areas of the country.\par \par \uc2 The Legislature is considering several other immigration bills, including one by Howard to make the employment of an unauthorized alien illegal.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110215e72f002ao\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PIERRE, S.D. (AP) - South Dakota should crack down on businesses that hire illegal immigrants as a way to minimize problems until Congress finally comes up with a national solution, a state senator said Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 Sen. Craig Tieszen, R-Rapid City, said he decided to stay away from measures that seek to increase state law enforcement directly against illegal immigrants because such proposals lead to worries about discrimination and racial profiling. If employers understand they will be penalized for hiring illegal immigrants, the decrease in available jobs will mean fewer illegal immigrants come to the state, he said.\par \par \uc2 "That's the main reason illegal immigrants would come to South Dakota, probably not for the weather but for work," Tieszen said.\par \par \uc2 Tieszen presented his bill to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday, but the panel delayed a vote until Thursday because it ran out of time to hear all the people who wanted to testify on the measure.\par \par \uc2 Opponents thanked Tieszen for focusing on businesses instead of on illegal immigrants directly. But they said the state should leave immigration enforcement up to federal officials.\par \par \uc2 Sam Ellingson of the American Civil Liberties Union of South Dakota said the bill could send a message that South Dakota does not welcome any immigrants, even skilled legal immigrants who are needed to fill jobs.\par \par \uc2 "Policies like this ultimately present South Dakota as an unfriendly environment to immigrants," Ellingson said.\par \par \uc2 Tieszen said federal law already makes it illegal for businesses or people to hire illegal immigrants, but federal officials do little to enforce immigration laws because the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement now spends much of its time fighting illegal drugs, computer crimes and terrorism.\par \par \uc2 ICE deals mainly with illegal immigrants who commit violent crimes and those who have returned to the U.S. after being deported, Tieszen said. ICE officials have told state lawmakers they have no idea how many illegal immigrants are in South Dakota, he said.\par \par \uc2 South Dakota probably has more illegal immigrants than most people suspect, Tieszen said, but added, "I also believe it's not an overwhelming problem at this time."\par \par \uc2 The bill would provide that any employer caught hiring illegal immigrants the first time would be subject to a civil fine of up to $1,000, regardless of the number of illegal workers. A second or subsequent conviction could be a Class 2 misdemeanor, carrying a maximum penalty of 30 days in jail and a $500 fine, for hiring each \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Rachelle Hartze of Rapid City said she supports the bill because South Dakota needs to reduce the number of illegal immigrants in the state. Illegal immigrants increase costs to the federal, state and local governments for schools, health care and other services, she said.\par \par \uc2 The state and nation should encourage legal immigrants who want to become citizens and pay taxes, Hartze said.\par \par \uc2 But Karl Kroger, pastor of the Southeast United Methodist Church in Pierre, said he opposes the bill because illegal immigrants come to the U.S. to get jobs and provide their families with better lives. If workers are deported, parents are sometimes taken away from their children or entire families are sent back to bad conditions in their native countries, he said.\par \par \uc2 "I know if I were in their shoes and I had a family to take care of, I would take my chances to come here," \uc2 Kroger\uc2  said. "I don't think we need to make these people's lives more difficult than they already are."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110215e72f0028p\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

It's usually just summarized best by just explaining about how it's a product of living in the Bible belt. Kansans accept the laws and know that they just need to plan ahead when they want to purchase alcohol. ...\par \par \uc2 The tentative proposal would allow major retailers, grocery stores, convenience stores and other businesses to sell strong beer, wine and hard liquor. Currently those businesses are limited to just selling 3.2 beer.\par \par \uc2 While the debate will center on convenience, the battle is really about money and that is why both sides have high-paid lobbyists hard at work.\par \par \uc2 From a consumers point of view most would support this proposal. In the age of convenience, most consumers would prefer to just buy their alcohol at the supermarket instead of making an extra stop at the liquor store. In an emporiagazette.com online poll - 58 percent were in favor of changing the liquor laws and 39 percent weren't.\par \par \uc2 But convenience will come at a cost which would mean hurting the independent liquor stores.\par \par \uc2 Over the last several decades retailing has changed. One stop shopping at major retailers has closed many of the independently owned business that dotted main streets. For the most part, liquor stores have survived the retailing changes since state law limited competition.\par \par \uc2 If the liquor laws are changed the impact will vary depending on the size of a community.\par \par \uc2 For Emporia more liberal liquor laws would be devastating to the independent liquor stores. It would pit the mom and pop liquor stores against the major retailers. Since so much is purchased at the major retailers in our community the independent liquor stores would lose out.\par \par \uc2 But for the small rural communities who have no liquor stores or major retailers but cling to the one grocery store this change could give those stores extra income to help their community grocery store in business.\par \par \uc2 This debate in Topeka will be interesting to watch and it will be interesting to see how legislators handle the issue since they represent all sizes of communities where some of their constituents would benefit from the legislation and others would be hurt by it.\par \par \uc2 For Emporia, it's in the community's best interest to keep the liquor laws the same in an effort to keep as many businesses operating as possible. ...\par \par \uc2 The Hutchinson News, Feb. 14\par \par \uc2 Voter ID bill\par \par \uc2 Leaving aside Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach's exaggeration of fraudulent voting, it is worth having a discussion about how to do elections better in Kansas.\par \par \uc2 Voter ID isn't a bad idea, and neither is requiring proof of citizenship for registration. But these surely can be accomplished in a way that doesn't hurt citizen participation in our democracy.\par \par \uc2 A Kansas House committee last week heard testimony on Kobach's Secure and Fair Elections Act. Action is delayed at least until Feb. 21. The bill would require voters to show photo identification when they go to vote. It also would require people who register to vote for the first time in Kansas to provide proof of citizenship, such as a birth certificate or passport. And it increases the penalties for election crimes and allows the secretary of state to prosecute election fraud cases.\par \par \uc2 The problem is that while Kobach seeks a name for himself by trying to give Kansas the toughest laws against voter fraud in the nation, he might also succeed in giving Kansas the lowest voter participation rate in the country.\par \par \uc2 It is important to establish, first, that election fraud is not a big problem in Kansas. Kobach has documented just 59 reports of alleged irregularities among millions of votes casts on ballots since 1997.\par \par \uc2 That said, there are ways to vote more than once in Kansas. The system hardly is fool-proof.\par \par \uc2 There must be ways to verify citizenship and voter authenticity without it being too onerous or scaring off legitimate voters. Instead of requiring someone to dig up a birth certificate or produce a passport when registering to vote, why not just provide a social security number - something most everyone knows - along with one or more other pieces of personal information and let the elections office verify citizenship? And in lieu of a driver's license or some other ID that not everyone might have, how about allowing voters to use the county-issued voter registration card at the polls?\par \par \uc2 The point is that Kobach's bill puts the burden on the voter to prove he is a citizen and may be allowed to vote, when the burden should be on the government to prove otherwise and not to infringe on American citizens' fundamental right to vote. In his zeal to make sure not a single \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  ever goes near a voting booth, Kobach seems willing to impair the rights of legal citizens. ...\par \par \uc2 The Lawrence Journal-World, Feb. 13\par \par \uc2 Budget strings\par \par \uc2 Kansans understand that state lawmakers face a difficult budget challenge this year.\par \par \uc2 Most Kansans also would applaud efforts to place a lid on spending in the state budget.\par \par \uc2 What many Kansans would object to, however, is bypassing the democratic legislative process to achieve those goals.\par \par \uc2 Rules passed by the Kansas House earlier this month give the House Appropriations Committee exclusive power for setting the total of the body's proposed state budget. That means that as few as 12 House members -- a majority of the 23-member Appropriations Committee -- will set a budget limit that can't be exceeded even by a majority vote of the entire House.\par \par \uc2 The rule change is being portrayed as a "pay-go" provision, which would require any spending increase to be offset by a spending cut elsewhere in the budget. On some level, that seems like a reasonable approach, but, in practice, it hamstrings any effort to make significant changes in the budget after it has come out of the Appropriations Committee. That committee always has been one of the most powerful in the House; now it's power is almost absolute.\par \par \uc2 An example of how the provision will affect budget consideration played out last week when the House approved a bill to cut state spending for the current fiscal year. Among other things, the bill approved 7.5 percent salary cuts for state employees making more than $100,000 per year. The bill also cut state spending on special education to a level that some legislators contend will cost Kansas between $16 million and $25 million in federal education funds in future years.\par \par \uc2 Democrats proposed several unsuccessful amendments to restore some of that funding. Trying to accommodate the pay-go provision, Rep. Jerry Henry, Cummings, proposed raising funds by forcing the sale of excess state property. Members of the House Rules Committee wouldn't allow that move because the budget had no line item for selling property and the funding was uncertain.\par \par \uc2 This situation illustrates just how difficult it will be to make any significant changes to the House budget proposal after it leaves Appropriations Committee. Giving the budget-writing committee so much control over the budget stifles the kind of give-and-take that should be part of the legislative process.\par \par \uc2 The rules also may widen the disparities between budget proposals passed in the House and in the Senate. Many constituents already are looking to the Senate to be a more moderate voice on some budget issues. If the House Appropriations Committee draws severe or unreasonable lines on state spending, negotiations with the Senate will become more difficult.\par \par \uc2 When Kansas voters elect their state legislators, they expect those people to be able to represent their constituents in all important matters facing the Legislature. Unfortunately, the new Kansas House rules severely limit the ability of the vast majority of House members to have any influence over the Legislature's most important business: the state budget. ...\par \par \uc2 The Hays Daily News, Feb. 13\par \par \uc2 High cost of cutting costs\par \par \uc2 As the state of Kansas embarks on its right-sizing journey to only providing core services, the number of casualties is mounting. And we're just barely one month into the new legislative session and Gov. Sam Brownback's administration.\par \par \uc2 Through a series of executive orders not likely to be undone by the Legislature, Brownback's streamlining plan is steaming forward. Gone by gubernatorial fiat are the state's Animal Health Department, Livestock Commission, Conservation Commission, Agriculture Products Development Division, Arts Commission, Health Policy Authority, Kansas Inc. (an economic development agency), Parole Board, Commission on Disability Concerns, and the Department of Travel and Tourism.\par \par \uc2 Nobody should be surprised by the governor's moves. He vowed to move or abolish many agencies in his State of the State address. Nor should anybody be surprised when the Legislature starts moving to reduce or abolish funding in any number of other sectors. Voters, after all, indicated they wanted less spending and less government.\par \par \uc2 Absent much if any debate or discussion, the repercussions of such scorched-earth reductions shouldn't surprise anybody down the road either. Affected agencies and programs already are sounding the alarm.\par \par \uc2 The mental health community, for example, which already has seen in excess of $20 million cut from its programs since 2008, is bracing for even starker times. Brownback's proposed budget eliminates $10.2 million in grants used by community mental health centers to care for the uninsured. An additional $5 million will be saved by axing another program used to help severely emotionally disturbed children and their families.\par \par \uc2 "We've cut to the bone and gone into the bone, and I am not sure how we respond to another 12-percent cut," said Walt Hill, executive director of Hays-based High Plains Mental Health Center. "I think it's going to take redefining the public mental health system."\par \par \uc2 Without the aforementioned debate, such a redefinition will not take place. Or at least not until after the funding is gone. Yet state law still states community centers such as High Plains are required to provide care regardless of an ability to pay for services.\par \par \uc2 The need for services is not going to go away, even if mental health centers are forced to scale back, said Sheli Sweeney, advocacy and member services coordinator for the Association of Community Mental Health Centers of Kansas.\par \par \uc2 "Someone who is mentally ill and having a crisis ... they will get help somewhere," Sweeney said. "If they can't come to community mental health centers and get treated before the crisis or to deter them from the crisis, then they will end up in the emergency room. And they will end up in touch with law enforcement."\par \par \uc2 This strikes us as creating bigger problems down the road that will cost even more. With a $550 million deficit facing the state, short-term solutions are rising to the top.\par \par \uc2 The governor's spokeswoman, Sherriene Jones-Sontag, had this to say: "With that budget deficit, (Brownback) had to set priorities in state funding, those being the core services provided by the state: Education, social services like Medicaid, public safety."\par \par \uc2 It's not as if we weren't warned beforehand. Then-candidate Brownback repeatedly said the state shouldn't be in the business of picking winners and losers.\par \par \uc2 We didn't pick up on the nuance of his words, however. It's apparent he believes the state merely should be in the business of picking losers. And we haven't yet heard how the Medicaid program is going to be reformed.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110215e72f001yl\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHOENIX (AP) - Republican lawmakers want to widen Arizona's illegal immigration crackdown with a proposal to require hospitals to check on whether patients are in the country legally, causing outrage among medical professionals who fear becoming de facto immigration agents under the law.\par \par \uc2 The medical industry ripped the bill Monday as it was scheduled for a hearing by the Senate Judiciary Committee. Doctors envisioned scenarios in which immigrants with contagious diseases such as tuberculosis would stay home from the clinic or hospital and put themselves and the public at a grave health risk.\par \par \uc2 "This is making us into a police state that will try to catch people when they are sick," said George Pauk, a retired doctor with an organization called Physicians for a National Health Program. "Do we want to stop sick people from coming in for health care?"\par \par \uc2 Arizona is the first Legislature to take up such a measure amid a national push in conservative states to crack down on illegal immigration, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Arizona lawmakers ignited the debate a year ago when they passed a bill that required local police, while enforcing other laws, to question the immigration status of those they suspect are in the country illegally. A judge later put that provision on hold.\par \par \uc2 The discussion about the bill comes just days after an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  in Texas with a banana-size tumor in her spine said she was ousted from her hospital because of her immigration status. She later found another hospital to get treatment.\par \par \uc2 Supporters say the hospital bill is necessary tool to fight illegal immigration at a time when hospitals lose tens of millions of dollars treating illegal immigrants in emergency rooms.\par \par \uc2 Senate President Russell Pearce, a Mesa Republican who was chief sponsor of last year's immigration law, says the hospitals bill is part of a broader effort to crack down on illegal immigration. The hospitals bill wouldn't bar people from getting care, but it would put the onus on hospitals to "do due diligence," Pearce said. "We're going to enforce our laws without apology."\par \par \uc2 Added Pearce: "It's the law. It's a felony to (aid and) abet. We're going to enforce the law without apology."\par \par \uc2 Other sponsors of the bill did not immediately return calls seeking comment. Discussion of the bill in the committee was put on hold late Monday until a later date.\par \par \uc2 The legislation, known as Senate Bill 1405, would require hospitals, when admitting nonemergency cases, to confirm that a person seeking care is a U.S. citizen or in the country legally. In emergency cases where the patient isn't here legally, the hospital would be required to call immigration authorities after the treatment is done. Hospitals in non-emergency situations would also be required to contact federal immigration authorities, but they would have more apparent discretion about whether to treat illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Opponents say the bill could pose serious health risks to those here legally and illegally. They believe the threat of deportation would keep some people from seeking health care for everything from emergency situations to measures such as vaccinations, potentially leading to preventable deaths. They also said it would increase hospitals' already-strained workload.\par \par \uc2 "You are now turning medical professionals into full-time INS agents," said Democratic state Sen. Steve Gallardo, speaking at a news conference Monday. "Doctors that should be working to help treat ill patients are now turning into ICE agents."\par \par \uc2 Nicole Russell is the mother of a 3-year-old daughter named Kira, and she could not envision what it would be like for a parent to decide whether or not to take their child to the hospital for fear of being reported to the authorities.\par \par \uc2 "I can't imagine putting the health care of my daughter in the hands of politicians," she said.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110215e72f0003l\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

Senate panel OKs bills targeting birthright citizenship, allowing seizure from illegals\b0\par\par\uc2 By SEAN MURPHY   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 674 \uc2 words\par \uc2 15 February 2011\par 18:17\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2011.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) - A Senate committee on Monday easily approved a pair of Republican-sponsored bills designed to crack down on illegal immigration, despite concerns from Democrats that the bills were an example of "mean-spirited" political pandering.\par \par \uc2 The Senate Judiciary Committee approved both measures on party-line votes. One would deny Oklahoma citizenship to babies born to illegal immigrants, while the other, dubbed "Arizona-plus" by its author, would allow police to not only question people about their immigration status, but also to confiscate property -- including homes and vehicles -- belonging to those in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 Both measures now advance to the Senate Appropriations Committee.\par \par \uc2 Republican Sen. Ralph Shortey, who wrote the immigration bills and represents a heavily Hispanic district in south Oklahoma City, said he disagrees with the current interpretation of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution that babies born in this country automatically become American citizens. He said his bill on asset forfeiture would give law enforcement an incentive to capture and jail illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 "Legal Hispanics in my district are very supportive of these laws," Shortey said. "Illegal Hispanics are not, and to be quite honest, I really don't care what they think."\par \par \uc2 Shortey's bill includes language similar to an Arizona law that allows police conducting traffic stops or questioning people about other possible legal violations to ask them about their immigration status if there is reasonable suspicion that they're in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 Arizona's law ignited protests over whether it would lead to racial profiling, and prompted lawsuits by the Justice Department, civil rights groups and other opponents seeking to have it thrown out. A federal judge has ordered some of the Arizona law placed on hold.\par \par \uc2 The Oklahoma bill would go a step further by allowing police to confiscate vehicles or property used to transport or house illegal immigrants, Shortey said. The money from the sale of such property would help pay to incarcerate the illegal immigrants in county jails and for their prosecution.\par \par \uc2 "We're one-upping the Arizona legislation. We're making it better," Shortey said. "If you give (law enforcement) a fiscal reason why they should do it, then they're going to enforce these laws."\par \par \uc2 Sen. Judy Eason-McIntyre, D-Tulsa, described both measures as a "mean-spirited" political ploy to distract voters from more important issues, such as the state budget and Oklahoma's economy. She voiced concern that such a law encourages discrimination against both illegal immigrants and Hispanic Americans.\par \par \uc2 "I gave the example of Nazi Germany," Eason-McIntyre said after the meeting. "You start defining people, saying who's worthy and who's not worthy, and it leads to a lot of negative things directed at people who are very vulnerable.\par \par \uc2 "It becomes easier to mistreat people when they become, in your mind, sub-humans."\par \par \uc2 Nationwide, state lawmakers introduced more than 1,400 bills and resolutions related to immigrants or immigration in 2010, including six states in which bills similar to Arizona's were introduced, according to the National Conference on State Legislatures.\par \par \uc2 None of the Arizona-style bills was enacted.\par \par \uc2 Targeting birthright citizenship appears to be the latest pet project of anti-\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  lawmakers across the country, said Michele Waslin, a policy analyst for the Washington, D.C.-based Immigration Policy Center.\par \par \uc2 "It's kind of an idea that's always been around with the extreme anti-immigrant folks," Waslin said. "This year it seems to be more popular as more people try to be tough on illegal immigration."\par \par \uc2 Waslin said Oklahoma risks expensive court costs trying to defend such laws and being alienated by businesses and industry who view such measures as extreme.\par \par \uc2 "Arizona has lost millions of dollars from people who have boycotted tourism there and withdrew conferences," she said. "If police are going to be arresting people for their immigration violations, that means an increase costs to detain and prosecute these people."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110215e72f0002w\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) - The leader of an anti-\uc2 illegal-immigrant\uc2  group was convicted Monday in a home invasion robbery that left a 9-year-old girl and her father dead in what prosecutors said was an attempt to steal drug money to fund the group's operations.\par \par \uc2 A Tucson jury found Shawna Forde, 42, guilty of murder in the May 2009 killings of Raul Flores, 29, and his daughter Brisenia at their home in Arivaca, a desert community 10 miles north of Mexico.\par \par \uc2 The jury deliberated for seven hours over two days. Forde was convicted on two counts of first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder for the shooting of Flores' wife and related aggravated assault and robbery counts.\par \par \uc2 The jury will return to Pima County Superior Court on Tuesday to decide if the death penalty should be considered.\par \par \uc2 Forde had pleaded not guilty.\par \par \uc2 Her attorney, Eric Larsen, argued that Forde was never inside the home. Prosecutors disputed that contention, saying Forde was the ringleader if the operation and the law is clear.\par \par \uc2 "She didn't put a gun to Brisenia's head ... but she was the one in charge," prosecutor Rick Unklesbay told jurors. "Because of that you must hold her accountable."\par \par \uc2 Larsen said Forde talked a big game, but "she frankly just didn't have the wherewithal to do this."\par \par \uc2 Calls seeking comment from Larsen on Monday were not immediately returned.\par \par \uc2 Forde is the leader of the Minutemen American Defense, a small border watch group. Prosecutors argued that she planned the attack to help fund its anti-immigrant operations.\par \par \uc2 Authorities said Forde and two men dressed as law enforcement officers, forced their way into Flores' home then shot him, his daughter and wife, Gina Gonzalez, who survived her injuries after getting into a gun battle with the attackers.\par \par \uc2 Flores was believed to be involved with drug trafficking, police said, but officers don't think the assailants found much cash or drugs in the home.\par \par \uc2 A 911 recording released by the Pima County sheriff's office captured Gonzalez pleading for help after her husband and daughter were shot. She was heard crying out in pain from a gunshot wound then becoming frantic as the attackers returned.\par \par \uc2 The sound of nine gunshots was heard as Gonzalez engaged the intruders.\par \par \uc2 "Oh my God, I can't believe they killed my family," Gonzalez said on the recording.\par \par \uc2 Police said Gonzalez shot and wounded one of her attackers, Jason Eugene Bush, who officers believe was the gunman.\par \par \uc2 Another man, Albert Robert Gaxiola, is accused of providing information about the area.\par \par \uc2 Bush and Gaxiola go on trial in the spring.\par \par \uc2 Before coming to Arizona, Forde lived in Everett, Wash., where she ran for the City Council in 2007, promising to allow police to check the immigration status of suspects, according to news accounts.\par \par \uc2 Chris Simcox, founder of the Minuteman Civil Defense Corps, said his group expelled Forde in 2007 amid allegations of lying and pretending to be a senior leader. Forde began her own group, bragging that it would be going after drug cartels, he said.\par \par \uc2 "We knew that Shawna Forde was not just an unsavory character but pretty unbalanced, as well," Simcox said.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110214e72e00312\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (AP) - A South Dakota legislative committee rejected a bid Monday to establish immigration laws in the state that mimic the ones passed by Arizona last year.\par \par \uc2 Rep. Manny Steele, R-Sioux Falls, introduced a bill to direct law officers enforcing other laws to make reasonable attempts to ask about a suspect's immigration status if there's reason to believe that person is in the U.S. illegally.\par \par \uc2 He's said he wants to protect the public from crimes committed by illegal immigrants and the resulting costs.\par \par \uc2 "These people who are here legally are part of our society. I welcome them. They belong here," Steele previously told The Associated Press. "I'm glad they're here. They are helping our economy grow. As far as I'm concerned, they're needed."\par \par \uc2 The bill would have directed law enforcement officers to find out a suspect's immigration status if they have a reason to suspect that person is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . It also would have made it illegal for anyone to transport or hide an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  or to encourage an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  to come to South Dakota.\par \par \uc2 Steele's bill drew impassioned arguments from both supporters and opponents during Monday's House State Affairs Committee hearing. But the committee voted 11-2 to reject the bill.\par \par \uc2 Aberdeen Mayor Mike Levsen said the "reasonable suspicion" requirement would divert city police from other duties. Investigating the status of a single person could take hours, he said.\par \par \uc2 "To put it bluntly, we just don't have the time," he said.\par \par \uc2 Sister Janet Horstman of Aberdeen's Presentation Sisters said she thought the bill "opens the door to racial profiling." Tom Barnett, executive director of the State Bar of South Dakota, said he opposed the bill "if for no other reason, then from a taxpayers' standpoint."\par \par \uc2 "We will get sued, and we will lose," he said.\par \par \uc2 Arguing in support of the bill, Rep. Stace Nelson, R-Fulton, said he understood people questioned whether South Dakota had an immigration problem. Steele has previously estimated about 2,000 illegal immigrants live in the state.\par \par \uc2 "If we did not have an illegal immigration problem, there would be no opponents to this bill," Nelson said.\par \par \uc2 But after co-sponsoring the bill, Rep. Charles Hoffman, R-Eureka, said he had changed his mind.\par \par \uc2 "After listening to testimony today, I think it's clear we need to rethink this," Hoffman said.\par \par \uc2 Part of Steele's proposal comes directly from Arizona Senate Bill 1070, which has become a flashpoint in the national immigration debate.\par \par \uc2 Both bills describe "reasonable suspicion" with the same words: "For any lawful contact made by a law enforcement official or agency of this state or a county, city, town, or other political subdivision of this state where reasonable suspicion exists that the person is an alien who is unlawfully present in the United States, a reasonable attempt shall be made, when practicable, to determine the immigration status of the person."\par \par \uc2 After the federal government sued to stop the Arizona law, that requirement was put on hold by U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton. Bolton also stopped a mandate that immigrants obtain or carry immigration registration papers, which Steele's proposal would not have required.\par \par \uc2 Bolton allowed other parts of Arizona's bill to take effect. The lawsuit remains in federal appeals court.\par \par \uc2 South Dakota Attorney General Marty Jackley has signed a legal brief in the case arguing against the federal government's position that states don't have the authority to enforce U.S. immigration laws.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110214e72e002rv\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

(AP) - A Cobb County grand jury has indicted a Georgia college student and \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  on a felony charge of making a false statement.\par \par \uc2 The Marietta Daily Journal reports that Kennesaw State University student Jessica Colotl was indicted Thursday. Sheriff's office officials said Colotl gave deputies a false address and telephone number when she was being booked after an arrest.\par \par \uc2 Colotl's case sparked a larger debate on illegal immigration in the state after she was stopped for a minor traffic violation last spring, arrested for driving without a license and nearly deported.\par \par \uc2 District Attorney Pat Head said his office pursued the indictment "because we believe the evidence was sufficient to present to a grand jury."\par \par \uc2 The case has been assigned to Cobb County superior court judge Mary Staley, but no trial date has been set.\par \par \uc2 Two lawyers who are representing Colotl in her traffic violation case, Chris Taylor and Jerome Lee, did not respond to an e-mail seeking comment Saturday.\par \par \uc2 If Colotl is convicted, she likely won't get a harsh sentence. Probation is common in such cases, Head said.\par \par \uc2 Colotl was arrested March 30, a day after her traffic stop, when she still could not produce a driver's license. The Cobb County jail participates in a federal-local partnership program, called 287(g), that allows trained deputies to check an inmate's immigration status and flag them for federal authorities if they are in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 She was handed over to federal immigration authorities on April 1 and sent to a detention center in Alabama.\par \par \uc2 Her case got media after members of her sorority from different universities wore their Lambda Theta Alpha gear and carried signs saying they were marching to support Colotl at an immigration rally at the state Capitol May 1.\par \par \uc2 The ACLU said it contacted DHS on her behalf and Kennesaw State said it was "actively engaged in intervening on her behalf on several fronts."\par \par \uc2 ICE released Colotl a few days later and deferred action on her case for a year, allowing her to complete her classes.\par \par \uc2 She was convicted in November of driving without a license, but she has appealed her case to the Georgia Court of Appeals. She was acquitted at the same time of the initial charge of impeding the flow of traffic.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Information from: Marietta Daily Journal, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://mdjonline.com/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://mdjonline.com/}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110212e72c003k4\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 MANASSAS, Va. (AP) - A Salvadoran man who was ordered deported nearly a decade ago but never left has been charged with three counts of first-degree murder in a series of shootings and a knife attack in a Virginia suburb of Washington, authorities said Friday.\par \par \uc2 Jose Oswaldo Reyes Alfaro, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , was charged in the pair of attacks blocks apart Thursday night that left three people dead and three others injured, Manassas Police Chief Doug Keen said.\par \par \uc2 Reyes Alfaro knew all of the victims, he said, but police were still sorting out the exact relationships. The county's chief prosecutor said he'll likely seek to upgrade the charges to capital murder, which could carry the death penalty.\par \par \uc2 The killings touched off further discussion of illegal immigration in Manassas and surrounding Prince William County, which was one of the early flashpoints in the national debate over whether local authorities should play a role in enforcing the nation's immigration laws.\par \par \uc2 "It's another abject failure of the federal government," said state Delegate Jackson Miller, R-Manassas, a former city council member and police officer. "Now we have three innocent victims in my city -- about a mile from my house there's a murderous rampage. I am furious. ... Yet it happens over and over and over again, and then we have to hear all of these apologetic excuses as to why we shouldn't be addressing criminal illegal aliens on the state or local level. It's just disgusting."\par \par \uc2 A similar uproar ensued in August when an allegedly drunken driver struck a car carrying three nuns, killing Sister Denise Mosier, 66. The man charged in that crash, 23-year-old Carlos Martinelly Montano, had been turned over to immigration authorities but was released pending a deportation hearing.\par \par \uc2 Nancy Lyall of the immigrant advocacy group Mexicans Without Borders said it was misleading to link an isolated criminal case with the issue of illegal immigration. In Prince William County, she said, "the undocumented population is a very, very low percentage of those who are accused of violent crimes."\par \par \uc2 She predicted that advocates of tougher immigration enforcement would use the Alfaro case to "stereotype every person that's here without documentation."\par \par \uc2 Chief Keen said that an immigration judge ordered that Reyes Alfaro be deported in 2002 after he failed to show up for a hearing. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokeswoman Cori Bassett said in a statement that Reyes Alfaro officially was classified as a fugitive in 2006 and that the agency placed a detainer on him Friday, after his arrest on the murder charges.\par \par \uc2 While the Georgetown South development where the killings happened has been plagued with crime and some gang activity, Keen said the slayings were not gang-related.\par \par \uc2 Brenda Ashcraft, 56, and her son William Ashcraft, 37, were shot and killed in the first attack, which was called into police shortly after 7 p.m. Thursday. A 34-year-old woman was injured and remains hospitalized, and a 15-year-old girl was treated and released.\par \par \uc2 In the second attack, Keen said 48-year-old Julio Cesar Ulloa was shot and killed, and a 77-year-old woman suffered head wounds from a large knife.\par \par \uc2 Brenda Ashcraft's niece, Melissa King, said Friday that her aunt had been a victim of domestic violence by her boyfriend, whom she only knew as "Jose."\par \par \uc2 "He'd been causing trouble but she was too afraid to call police," King said, standing a few doors outside Ashcraft's home.\par \par \uc2 "They were good, good family, just full of love and support. This was not drug-related. This was not gang-related ... It was just domestic violence."\par \par \uc2 King said she has lived in the same neighborhood as her aunt her entire life.\par \par \uc2 "I know it's a bad neighborhood with crime, but so many people came out last night to offer us support. It was really like one big family," she said. She called her aunt "one of the rocks in our family. She'd give you her last piece of bread, her last dollar."\par \par \uc2 Reyes Alfaro made an initial appearance Friday morning in Prince William General District Court, and was ordered held without bond. His court-appointed lawyer, Kimberly Irving, declined to comment Friday except to say that she had only spoken with her client briefly.\par \par \uc2 Prince William Commonwealth's Attorney Paul Ebert said Friday that it's likely the charges will eventually be upgraded to capital murder -- which would make Reyes Alfaro eligible for the death penalty -- but a final decision has not been made because the investigation is still ongoing.\par \par \uc2 "Of course it's a very heinous crime," Ebert said.\par \par \uc2 Manassas, a city of nearly 37,000 about 30 miles west of the nation's capital, has averaged about two homicides a year since 2005, according to annual crime reports through 2009.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writers Dena Potter in Richmond and Ben Nuckols in Washington contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110212e72c000h9\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 BOSTON (AP) - When the U.S. Senate failed to pass the federal DREAM Act, Deivid Ribeiro and other undocumented student immigrants in Boston watched the voting on TV in silence. Some cried while others vowed to continue to press for a bill that would grant conditional legal status to young illegal immigrants who enroll in college or join the military.\par \par \uc2 Now, student immigrant advocates in Massachusetts say after the defeat of the DREAM Act they are shifting their efforts to an old fight -- state legislation that would allow undocumented students to attend Massachusetts public colleges at in-state tuition rates.\par \par \uc2 "Passing the Dream Act is going to take time," said Ribeiro, 22, an undocumented immigrant from Brazil and an aspiring astronaut. "In the meantime, people like myself can't afford to go to college and pay out-of-state tuition, even though we've lived here most of our lives."\par \par \uc2 Under the state proposal co-sponsored by Rep. Alice Wolf, D-Cambridge, and Sen. Sonia Chang-Diaz, D-Boston, \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students who graduated from a Massachusetts high school and have lived in the state for at least three years would be eligible for in-state tuition rates at state colleges. They would not be eligible for federal financial aid.\par \par \uc2 Similar laws have been adopted in at least 10 other states, including Texas, California and New York. Meanwhile, four states -- Arizona, Colorado, Georgia and South Carolina -- have passed laws specifically banning illegal immigrants from being eligible for in-state tuition.\par \par \uc2 The move to push Massachusetts lawmakers comes after a broad national coalition of undocumented students, or DREAMers, agreed to all work on local issues around education while they wait to see what direction the new Congress goes on immigration reform. Groups like the Student Immigrant Movement plan to launch a long campaign over the proposal, but also say they will hold workshops for immigrant students on how to apply to college.\par \par \uc2 Immigrant advocates have long wondered why a state like Massachusetts, dominated by Democratic lawmakers, has failed to pass an in-state tuition proposal a number of times.\par \par \uc2 "It doesn't make sense," said Ribeiro of the Boston-based Student Immigrant Movement. "But we are hoping to convince some lawmakers who have been on the fence by sharing our stories. We want to work and contribute." He said the group plans to lobby lawmakers and hold rallies.\par \par \uc2 Advocates said they also feel like they are in better position this session than in previous ones after Gov. Deval Patrick said in November he would work to adopt all of an immigrant advisory panel's recommendations, which included the in-state tuition proposal.\par \par \uc2 However, House Minority Leader Bradley Jones, R-North Reading, has vowed to oppose the measure on in-state tuition and predicted it would fail again. Some Democrats also have expressed concerns over costs and the need to address more pressing issues, like the state's budget.\par \par \uc2 Chang-Diaz said in order for the bill to pass this time, advocates and students will have to help bring attention to the bill and debunk "myths" surrounding the proposal.\par \par \uc2 "We have the facts on our side," said Chang-Diaz. "It's a revenue generator."\par \par \uc2 Chang-Diaz pointed to a study by the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation that estimates that 400 to 600 students might enter Massachusetts schools as a result of the bill and that it likely would result in $2.5 million of extra revenue.\par \par \uc2 Wolf said Massachusetts lawmakers have an obligation to tackle the issue of in-state tuition since the federal government has failed to address immigration reform. She said the immigrant students were going to continue to live in the Bay State and lawmakers might as well allow them to become productive.\par \par \uc2 "This is an emotional issue," said Wolf. "I hope what will move some of my colleagues is to understand how important it is that we support our economy and we support our kids and we not leave people hanging on the street corners or, if they are very lucky, maybe flipping hamburgers."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110211e72b002sq\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) - The man convicted of killing Washington intern Chandra Levy nearly a decade ago was sentenced Friday to 60 years in prison, a term that could keep him behind bars the rest of his life.\par \par \uc2 Ingmar Guandique would not be released from prison until he was at least about 80 years old, assuming he lives that long, said District of Columbia Superior Court Judge Gerald Fisher. The judge, who called Guandique a dangerous person and sexual predator, said the sentence would ensure he was not a danger to the community if he is released.\par \par \uc2 Guandique was convicted in November of first-degree murder in Levy's 2001 disappearance and death, despite a lack of witnesses and no DNA evidence linking him to the crime.\par \par \uc2 During Friday's sentencing hearing, Levy's mother, Susan Levy, asked Guandique directly if he had been responsible for her daughter's death. He looked her in the eyes and shook his head.\par \par \uc2 "Mr. Guandique, you are lower than a cockroach," Susan Levy told Guandique, calling him a "hideous creature" before closing her statement with: "F--- you."\par \par \uc2 She also read statements from her son, who urged the judge to impose a life sentence, and from her husband, who said Guandique should "rot in hell."\par \par \uc2 Guandique, wearing an orange jumpsuit, said in a brief statement in Spanish that he was sorry for what happened to Levy. But, he added, "I had nothing to do with it. I am innocent."\par \par \uc2 Levy's disappearance became a national sensation after she was romantically linked to then-California Rep. Gary Condit. Police initially focused on Condit as a suspect. Levy's remains were found in Rock Creek Park a year after she disappeared. Police eventually shifted their focus to Guandique, who was already serving a prison sentence for attacking female joggers in the park in the same time frame Levy disappeared.\par \par \uc2 Guandique is expected to serve about 50 years of his sentence.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors had asked for a life prison sentence, arguing that Guandique showed no remorse and had a history of violence toward women. They said Guandique, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from El Salvador, fled his village in that country as a teenager because he was suspected of attacking a woman at knifepoint.\par \par \uc2 Guandique's lawyers, however, argued for the minimum possible sentence of 30 years in prison. They pointed to his suffering as a child, including the severe poverty in which he was raised.\par \par \uc2 The judge said Guandique committed a "truly horrible crime" that came close to warranting a life sentence. Guandique's lawyers have 30 days to appeal.\par \par \uc2 Lawyers for the prosecution and defense declined to comment after the trial, but U.S. Attorney Ronald Machen said in a statement that he hopes the sentence "provides some measure of closure to the Levy family."\par \par \uc2 Also on Friday, the judge rejected Guandique's request for a new trial. Guandique's lawyers argued he should be granted a new trial because jurors improperly shared notes in reaching a verdict. They also argued prosecutors improperly appealed to the jury's emotions and facts that weren't part of trial evidence in making a graphic closing argument. But the judge rejected the argument about sharing notes and said he found the vast majority of the closing argument acceptable.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110211e72b001ir\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 MANASSAS, Va. (AP) - A Salvadoran man who was ordered deported nearly a decade ago but never left has been charged with three counts of first-degree murder in a series of shootings and a knife attack in a Virginia suburb of Washington, authorities said Friday.\par \par \uc2 Jose Oswaldo Reyes Alfaro, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , was charged in the pair of attacks blocks apart Thursday night that left three people dead and three others injured, Manassas Police Chief Doug Keen said.\par \par \uc2 Reyes Alfaro knew all of the victims, he said, but police were still sorting out the exact relationships.\par \par \uc2 The killings touched off further discussion of illegal immigration in Manassas and surrounding Prince William County, which was one of the early flashpoints in the national debate over whether local authorities should play a role in enforcing the nation's immigration laws.\par \par \uc2 "It's another abject failure of the federal government," said state Delegate Jackson Miller, R-Manassas, a former city council member and police officer. "Now we have three innocent victims in my city, about a mile from my house there's a murderous rampage. I am furious. ... Yet it happens over and over and over again, and then we have to hear all of these apologetic excuses as to why we shouldn't be addressing criminal illegal aliens on the state or local level. It's just disgusting."\par \par \uc2 A similar uproar ensued in August when an allegedly drunken driver struck a car carrying three nuns, killing Sister Denise Mosier, 66. The man charged in that crash, 23-year-old Carlos Martinelly Montano, had been turned over to immigration authorities but was released pending a deportation hearing.\par \par \uc2 Nancy Lyall of the immigrant advocacy group Mexicans Without Borders said it was misleading to link an isolated criminal case with the issue of illegal immigration. In Prince William County, she said, "the undocumented population is a very, very low percentage of those who are accused of violent crimes."\par \par \uc2 She predicted that advocates of tougher immigration enforcement would use the Alfaro case to "stereotype every person that's here without documentation."\par \par \uc2 While the Georgetown South development where the killings happened has been plagued with crime and some gang activity, Keen said they were not gang-related.\par \par \uc2 Brenda Ashcraft, 56, and her son William Ashcraft, 37, were shot and killed in the first attack called into police shortly after 7 p.m. Thursday. A 34-year-old woman was injured and remains hospitalized, and a 15-year-old girl was treated and released.\par \par \uc2 In the second attack, Keen said 48-year-old Julio Cesar Ulloa was shot and killed, and a 77-year-old woman suffered head wounds from a large knife.\par \par \uc2 Brenda Ashcraft's niece, Melissa King, said Friday that her aunt had been a victim of domestic violence by her boyfriend, whom she only knew as "Jose."\par \par \uc2 "He'd been causing trouble but she was too afraid to call police," King said, standing a few doors outside Ashcraft's home.\par \par \uc2 "They were good, good family, just full of love and support. This was not drug-related. This was not gang-related ... It was just domestic violence."\par \par \uc2 King said she has lived in the same neighborhood as her aunt her entire life.\par \par \uc2 "I know it's a bad neighborhood with crime, but so many people came out last night to offer us support.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) - Attorneys finished closing arguments Thursday in the murder case against an anti-\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  group leader who is accused of gunning down a 9-year-old girl and her father in what prosecutors say was an attempt to steal drug money to fund border operations.\par \par \uc2 Shawna Forde pleaded not guilty to two counts of first-degree murder in the May 2009 killings of 29-year-old Raul Flores and his 9-year-old daughter at their home in Arivaca, a desert community about 50 miles southwest of Tucson and 10 miles north of the Mexican border.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutor Rick Unklesbay argued that phone calls and text messages sent by Forde clearly show she was responsible, while defense attorney Eric Larsen said they proved she had nothing to hide and should be found not guilty.\par \par \uc2 The jury could begin deliberations Thursday or Friday and could make a decision as early as Friday. If the jury convicts Forde, prosecutors plan to seek the death penalty.\par \par \uc2 The 42-year-old Forde is the leader of the Minutemen American Defense, a small border watch group, and prosecutors contend that she planned the attack to help fund her anti-immigrant operations.\par \par \uc2 Authorities allege that she and two men dressed as law enforcement officers forced their way into Flores' home, and then shot him, his daughter Brisenia and his wife, Gina Gonzalez, who survived her injuries.\par \par \uc2 Flores was believed to be involved with drug trafficking, police say, but officers don't think the assailants found much cash or drugs in the home.\par \par \uc2 Forde sat quietly in court Thursday, but smiled and joked with others during a break. Just after the closing arguments wrapped up, she turned to a man sitting in the courtroom and put her hand up to her forehead and mouthed, "Phew."\par \par \uc2 Larsen told jurors that the prosecution made his closing argument for him.\par \par \uc2 "The first words they said: `Taken in the context ...'" he said. "The only way that you get beyond a reasonable doubt is if there's only one context."\par \par \uc2 Larsen said a recorded phone conversation following the killings with a friend of Forde's who was cooperating with the FBI shows she wasn't involved in the home invasion.\par \par \uc2 She said "I don't know anything other than I'm trying to chase the cartels and the illegals, but home invasions and (stuff) like that, sorry -- that's not up my alley," Forde said during the call, according to Larsen.\par \par \uc2 "This is a woman with something to hide from the police?" Larsen said\par \par \uc2 Larsen also tried to cast doubt about whether Forde was in the home at the time of the killings, pointing the blame at the girlfriend of another man accused in the crime.\par \par \uc2 "The state's hour-and-10-minute argument to you was about everything in the doughnut, but not what fills the doughnut hole," he said. "The state did not meet its burden."\par \par \uc2 Unklesbay said text messages sent by Forde show she's guilty, pointing to a message sent to her daughter five hours after the killings that said: "I am knee-deep. Make something of your life and make me proud."\par \par \uc2 He said Forde also was recorded talking about how she was with fellow suspect Jason Bush when he was shot, only making up another story about how he was injured, saying: "We were running through the bush being chased by cartels."\par \par \uc2 "It's the words of the defendant herself," Unklesbay said.\par \par \uc2 He referred to another recorded conversation in which Forde says to a friend that they can't stay in Arivaca, "because that's where the targets are."\par \par \uc2 "The law is clear," Unklesbay told jurors. "She didn't put a gun to Brisenia's head ... but she was the one in charge. Because of that you must hold her accountable."\par \par \uc2 A 911 recording released by the Pima County Sheriff's Office in 2009 captures Gonzalez pleading for help after her husband and daughter were shot. She is heard crying out in pain from a gunshot wound and then becoming frantic as the attackers return.\par \par \uc2 The sound of nine gunshot wounds is heard as Gonzalez engages in a gunbattle with the intruders. "Oh my God, I can't believe they killed my family," Gonzalez says on the recording.\par \par \uc2 Police say Gonzalez shot and wounded one of her alleged attackers, Jason Eugene Bush, who officers believe was the gunman.\par \par \uc2 Forde is accused of being the ringleader, and another man, Albert Robert Gaxiola, allegedly provided information about the local area. Bush and Gaxiola go on trial in the spring.\par \par \uc2 Before coming to Arizona, Forde lived in Everett, Wash., where she ran for the city council in 2007, promising to allow police to check the immigration status of suspects, according to local news accounts.\par \par \uc2 Chris Simcox, founder of the Minuteman Civil Defense Corps, previously told The Associated Press that his group kicked Forde out in 2007 amid allegations of lying and pretending to be a senior leader, and that Forde began her own group, bragging that it would be going after drug cartels. That claim made him worry about the safety of other Minutemen, he said.\par \par \uc2 "We knew that Shawna Forde was not just an unsavory character but pretty unbalanced, as well," Simcox said.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110210e72a002ew\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 INDIANAPOLIS (AP) - An Indiana Senate committee approved a bill Wednesday night that its sponsor says would lead to an Arizona-style crackdown on illegal immigration in the state.\par \par \uc2 The Senate Pensions and Labor Committee voted 8-1 to advance the proposal, which opponents attacked during a four-hour public hearing as opening the door for legitimizing racial profiling.\par \par \uc2 Dozens of people lined up to testify on the bill, just hours after Indiana's Republican attorney general said he had reservations about the state inserting itself into what is a federal responsibility.\par \par \uc2 The bill proposed by Sen. Mike Delph, R-Carmel, would require police to ask for proof of citizenship or immigration status if they had a reasonable suspicion that a person is illegally in the country.\par \par \uc2 Delph told the committee that the bill was aimed at putting teeth into existing laws.\par \par \uc2 "We say `no more' to illegal immigration," he said. "We want the rule of law restored, period."\par \par \uc2 Sen. Mike Young, R-Indianapolis, said he didn't believe any committee members wanted to harm anyone's rights, but that legislators had a duty to uphold the laws that are in place and protect residents.\par \par \uc2 "I just think it is the right thing to do at this time," he said.\par \par \uc2 The only committee member to vote against the bill -- Democratic Sen. Karen Tallian of Portage -- said its proposals go to "ridiculous lengths" and were a "bazillion lawsuits waiting to happen."\par \par \uc2 Opponents outside the Senate chamber during the hearing held signs such as "Welcome to Indiana ... where you will be racially profiled."\par \par \uc2 Jose Salinas, a Marion County criminal court judge, challenged legislators who support the bill on whether they could understand being forced to prove their nationality.\par \par \uc2 Salinas said he feared police officers would rely on race, English fluency and last names to determine whom to question.\par \par \uc2 "Whether we want to believe it or not, human nature is what it is and the envelope is pushed all the time," Salinas said. "That always happens when these kind of laws are put forth."\par \par \uc2 Delph's original bill included a proposal that could have stripped companies who knowingly hire illegal immigrants of their business licenses after a third offense. That penalty had drawn opposition from business groups and the committee amended the bill to, instead, strip from offending companies whatever tax deductions were associated with each \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Kevin Brinegar, president of the Indiana Chamber of Commerce, told the committee that the organization doesn't condone any improper hiring and that the revised penalty was far superior in that it wouldn't shut down businesses. He was still concerned an immigration crackdown could hurt the state's business climate.\par \par \uc2 "We have concerns in terms of economic development and the projection of an air of intolerance," Brinegar said.\par \par \uc2 Earlier Wednesday, state Attorney General Greg Zoeller joined business, religious and other leaders at a Statehouse event announcing support for what they called rational immigration reform principles.\par \par \uc2 That group's statement said immigration is a matter for the federal government. It calls for border security and respect for laws, but said that "law enforcement should focus on criminal activities, not civil violations of federal code."\par \par \uc2 Zoeller said taking on immigration enforcement might be "constitutionally suspect or fiscally impractical."\par \par \uc2 "It is a federal responsibility," he said. "It does us no good to try to assume the federal authority."\par \par \uc2 Bob Schrameyer, a leader of the Goshen group Citizens for Immigration Law Enforcement, told the Senate committee that illegal immigration was at least partly to blame for Elkhart County's double-digit unemployment rate.\par \par \uc2 "Employers have found it far too easy to hire illegal workers, which not only drives down wages to improve their bottom line, but take unfair advantage of a minority group," Schrameyer said. "We are tired of the lawbreakers thumbing their proverbial noses at our system and we tire of the opponents of state immigration legislation continuing their lame claim that it's a federal problem."\par \par \uc2 Goshen police Chief Wade Branson described the immigration proposal as an unfunded mandate on police agencies by piling more responsibilities on them. He also said it might discourage some people from reporting crimes or cooperating with police for fear of facing deportation.\par \par \uc2 "This adds another layer of work, detracting from the officers available to investigate and solve other crimes and provide security for the neighborhoods," Branson said.\par \par \uc2 The bill now goes to the Senate Appropriations Committee for consideration of its financial costs.\par \par \uc2 5\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110210e72a0008e\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

He faces a minimum of 30 years in prison and a maximum sentence of life.\par \par \uc2 In November, a jury convicted Guandique of first-degree murder in Levy's May 2001 disappearance and death, despite a lack of witnesses and no DNA evidence linking Guandique to the crime.\par \par \uc2 Levy's disappearance became a national sensation in 2001 after she was romantically linked to then Rep. Gary Condit, D-Calif. Police initially focused on Condit as a suspect. But after Levy's remains were found in a heavily wooded area of Rock Creek Park in May 2002, police slowly shifted their focus to Guandique, who was already serving a 10-year prison sentence for attacking female joggers in the park in the same time frame that Levy went missing.\par \par \uc2 In a sentencing memo Tuesday, prosecutors say that Guandique's history of violence against women goes back to his teenage years in El Salvador. In fact, they say he fled to the United States as a teenager because he was suspected of attacking a woman at knifepoint in his village.\par \par \uc2 And they say his history of improper, impulsive behavior toward women has continued in prison, where he has masturbated in front of female guards and propositioned a staff nurse. Prosecutors say he also sent sexually vulgar drawings to a woman whose address he found from an insurance advertisement.\par \par \uc2 Guandique "is unable to control himself and thus, will always remain a danger to women," prosecutors Amanda Haines, Fernando Campoamor-Sanchez and Chris Kavanaugh wrote in their sentencing memo.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors also cite Guandique's lack of remorse.\par \par \uc2 "Not once has defendant expressed any concern or sympathy for the victim and her family," the prosecutors wrote. "It is this lack of remorse or empathy for his fellow man that makes defendant such a danger to society."\par \par \uc2 Guandique's lawyers are asking the judge to set aside the verdict and order a new trial. They argue that prosecutors improperly played on jurors' emotions in their closing argument, and they cited a juror's comment to a newspaper reporter that some jurors shared notes, which the defense argues is evidence of juror misconduct.\par \par \uc2 In a reply brief filed Tuesday, the government argues that a new trial is not warranted. The sharing of juror notes, if it occurred, is at most a technical violation that had no substantive effect on the trial's outcome, prosecutors argued.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110208e728002aq\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 RICHMOND, Va. (AP) - The House of Delegates has advanced a slate of anti-\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  bills, including one that would require Virginia's public colleges to bar undocumented students from enrolling and another that would deny public benefits to people in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 The House voted 75-24 Tuesday to approve Del. Christopher Peace's bill, which would amend state law to require colleges to have written policies explicitly denying enrollment to people who are in the United States illegally. Federal law prohibits undocumented students from paying in-state tuition or receiving federal aid, but they can still pursue a public college education.\par \par \uc2 Virginia's public two- and four-year institutions currently have the discretion to decide whether to admit illegal aliens as long as they charge them out-of-state tuition. Policies vary from school to school.\par \par \uc2 Opponents of the bills, which passed largely along party lines, said they would unfairly penalize children of immigrants, and would deny them a path to a productive life.\par \par \uc2 "The bill is punishing children for what their parents did," Del. Mark Sickles, D-Fairfax County, said of the higher-education legislation Tuesday on the House floor. "Clear and simple, that is what it does."\par \par \uc2 The House voted 83-16 to approve Del. David Albo's bill requiring localities to verify that people are legal U.S. residents before providing them state or local public assistance, except for assistance mandated by federal law. The legislation also allows for withholding state funding to agencies or localities that fail to do so.\par \par \uc2 Also approved Tuesday was a bill that would allow Virginia State Police to perform certain immigration law-enforcement functions, including arresting and detaining criminal aliens, under an agreement with federal authorities.\par \par \uc2 "This does not deal with laborers, it does not deal with schoolchildren," bill sponsor Del. Jackson Miller, R-Manassas, said before his legislation passed 78-20. "It deals with criminals and criminals only."\par \par \uc2 Other legislation approved Tuesday would require local law-enforcement officers to ask about a person's immigration status when making an arrest, and would require increased use of e-Verify, the federal system that checks new hires' immigration status.\par \par \uc2 The House also approved a bill that would require local school divisions to collect data on the number of students enrolled in English as a Second Language courses and report such data to the state Board of Education. The bill also would require school divisions to report the number of students whose parents are unable to provide their children's birth certificates when they enroll.\par \par \uc2 "The bill assumes that collecting this information will yield some information relevant to the cost of educating undocumented students by accepting the mythology and stereotype that most (or almost all) students enrolled in classes for English language learners or who don't have birth certificates are undocumented," Claire Guthrie Gastanaga, a lobbyist for the Virginia Coalition of Latino Organizations, said in a statement. "This is nothing more than invidious racial and ethnic stereotyping."\par \par \uc2 Several House Republicans have said such legislation is needed to address the problems and costs of illegal immigration, which they say is a result of a broken federal immigration system.\par \par \uc2 The bills face an uphill battle in the Democrat-controlled Senate.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110208e7280027r\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PIERRE, S.D. (AP) - An attempt to challenge automatic U.S. citizenship for children born in the country of illegal immigrants was rejected Monday by a South Dakota legislative panel.\par \par \uc2 The House Judiciary Committee voted 8-5 to kill the bill after opponents said it attempted to solve the problem the wrong way and would violate rights guaranteed by the South Dakota Constitution.\par \par \uc2 The bill called for South Dakota to join a compact with other states in an attempt to require that a child born in the U.S. qualify as a citizen only if at least one parent is a U.S. citizen or a legal immigrant. States in the compact would issue different birth certificates for those who are citizens and those who are not, but such compacts would have to be approved by Congress.\par \par \uc2 The bill's sponsor, Rep. Manny Steele, R-Sioux Falls, said the bill was intended to prompt Congress to propose a change in the 14th Amendment, which now guarantees citizenship to anyone born in the country. He said Congress could propose a constitutional amendment preventing citizenship for any baby without at least one parent who is a citizen or legal immigrant.\par \par \uc2 Steele said many people enter the U.S. illegally to give birth so their babies will be citizens.\par \par \uc2 "Our system is being abused, and this state compact is a method to correct this abuse," Steele said.\par \par \uc2 However, lawyers said provisions in the state Constitution guarantee equal treatment for citizens and resident aliens and prohibit granting rights only to certain classes of people.\par \par \uc2 Tom Barnett, executive director of the State Bar of South Dakota, said Steele's bill would be unconstitutional, but the Legislature could approve a resolution urging Congress to propose a constitutional amendment on citizenship.\par \par \uc2 Sister Myra Remily, of Aberdeen, representing the Presentation Sisters, said the organization of nuns opposes the bill because it would create a class of people with fewer rights than others. Children of illegal immigrants would belong to no country and would be punished because of their parents' actions, she said.\par \par \uc2 "Remember the innocent children," Remily said.\par \par \uc2 Sam Ellingson, program coordinator for the American Civil Liberties Union of South Dakota, said the U.S. Supreme Court has already ruled that all children born in the U.S. are citizens regardless of their parents' status. A state legislature cannot decide which people are citizens, she said.\par \par \uc2 Steele said South Dakota needs to deal with the issue of illegal immigrants because they can cause expensive problems. One \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  convicted of murder has been sentenced to life in prison, which could cost the state up to $750,000 if he lives 50 years behind bars, he said.\par \par \uc2 Rep. Stace Nelson, R-Fulton, said his wife is a legal immigrant and he supports people who enter the U.S. legally. However, the Legislature should not support illegal immigrants, he said.\par \par \uc2 "It is not my job under the Constitution to aid and abet these people," Nelson said.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110208e7280004z\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 HELENA, Mont. (AP) - Gov. Brian Schweitzer issued a stern warning Monday that he will veto a growing list of bills he says are unconstitutional, frivolous or don't deal with jobs.\par \par \uc2 Schweitzer, a Democrat, said the Legislature's own lawyers have warned that at least 20 Republican-backed bills could be unconstitutional. The governor said he thinks that list is conservative -- making it clear there could be a lot of vetoes.\par \par \uc2 Republicans said they are moving ahead with their legislative plans and will deal with the vetoes individually when they come. The GOP has a big majority but doesn't have enough votes in the Senate to override vetoes.\par \par \uc2 "It's still early in the process. Let the Legislature do its work here for a little bit," said Senate President Jim Peterson, a rancher from Buffalo. "I don't think the governor has any special license to tell citizen legislators whey they can and can't do on behalf of their constituents."\par \par \uc2 Schweitzer said the list of unconstitutional bills includes anti-\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  measures like one heard Monday that attempts to interpret the U.S. Constitution with a new state law clarifying who gets citizenship. Other GOP measures would attempt to nullify federal laws like the Endangered Species Act, or proclaim state eminent domain authority over federal lands.\par \par \uc2 Other examples that attempt to undermine the federal health care law that lawyers have warned could run up against the supremacy clause, which says the Constitution and federal law is "the supreme law of the land," or separation of powers concerns at the state level for ordering the attorney general to take action in a lawsuit.\par \par \uc2 Schweitzer said his failed lawsuit last year challenging the constitutionality of a spending measure is prompting him to consider many more vetoes since the judge in the case told the governor he should veto those he views as unconstitutional rather than sue over them.\par \par \uc2 "We are sworn to uphold the Constitution. And I will uphold my part of it," Schweitzer said. "I am not a lawyer but i can read the Constitution."\par \par \uc2 Schweitzer said frivolous bills include one allowing spear hunting and another where lawmakers adopt an author's Code of the West as the Code of Montana. The governor the said Montana families can set their own codes to live by, and under the Montana Constitution they have "an opportunity to live a life of freedom as they choose."\par \par \uc2 Schweitzer said he thinks he has talked to a lot of concerned citizens in his years travelling the state.\par \par \uc2 "In seven years, in all those conversations there have been thousands of good ideas," Schweitzer said. "But I never had a single person in all that time suggest that what we really need to do is have the right to hunt with a spear."\par \par \uc2 The governor also castigated as ineffective the GOP rewrite of what previously had been a bipartisan measure to decrease worker's compensation rates -- sending a strong message he prefers the original joint labor-business offering. The Republican plan instead better rewards doctors and others, saving more of its money by cutting payments to workers.\par \par \uc2 The governor said he thinks the original, which is favored by labor interests, does a better job.\par \par \uc2 Peterson pointed out that the GOP plan has been independently scored to save state businesses $180 million a year.\par \par \uc2 "That could create as many jobs as anything we do here," the Republican leader said. "That should be a signature bill for him."\par \par \uc2 And the governor said he views attempts to undermine his "clean and green" tax incentives for alternative energy an attempt to kill jobs in a sector he has wooed for transmission lines and wind farms. Supporters argue it is unfair to give the incentives to certain types of energy.\par \par \uc2 "Those are under assault by the Legislature right now -- those are job killing bills," Schweitzer said.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110208e7280001f\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

Monday, Jan. 31, 2011\par \par \uc2 Temporary freeze on economic incentives is called for\par \par \uc2 Back when the national economy was robust, many states including Texas got into the incentives game to lure businesses, and the jobs they brought, across state lines.\par \par \uc2 Texas and other states also have used state money to help jump-start high-tech start-ups that carried the promise of jobs.\par \par \uc2 It was a battle to behold, state versus state versus state, as businesses could pick and choose among incentive packages.\par \par \uc2 This peaked when the national economy was robust. And though there are positive economic indicators out there, robust is a memory and a goal. All states are dealing with having to try to do more with less. The reality, of course, is that -- barring tax hikes -- many states will do less with less.\par \par \uc2 Texas, regardless of what Republican candidates told you last fall, is in that category. And, for that reason, we believe it is time for a hiatus on the two main state-funded economic development programs -- the Emerging Technology Fund and the Enterprise Fund.\par \par \uc2 "We want Texas to grow, but we don't have the money," House Appropriations Committee Chairman Jim Pitts, R-Waxahachie, told the American-Statesman.\par \par \uc2 Senate Finance Committee Chairman Steve Ogden, R-Bryan, never a big fan of the funds, said finding any money for them in the 2012-13 budget will be "a tough sale."\par \par \uc2 We believe it's a tough sale for the right reason: Facing a massive projected shortfall, Texas has better things on which to spend money at this point. We're not talking about a lot of money (hundreds of millions of dollars out of a projected $79 billion in tax revenue) in the grand scheme of things, but a wide variety of relatively small cuts could reduce the pain of the large cuts to come.\par \par \uc2 House and Senate budget writers are at the starting point of what will be a lengthy process. The House's initial plan includes no new money for the Emerging Technology Fund or Enterprise Fund, leaving only unspent money still available. The Senate's starting-point budget diverts a third of the $151 million balance in the Enterprise Fund to job training programs.\par \par \uc2 Separate legislation has been filed to eliminate both funds. We don't see that as the way to go. Properly administered and funded, both funds -- or something like them -- remain part of a solid concept aimed at making Texas as attractive as possible to employers.\par \par \uc2 But the current money woes make this a good time to make sure the funds are properly administered when the state can resume funding them. The current setup places too much discretion in the governor's office, a fact hammered home by Gov. Rick Perry's heavy involvement in steering money to political allies. We're with those -- including Rep. Mark Strama, D-Austin -- who believe the process could stand some more sunshine.\par \par \uc2 Another thing that caught our eye about the funds was contained in a report by Comptroller Susan Combs, who concluded that only about 1 percent of Texas job growth resulted from incentives.\par \par \uc2 Back during robust economic times, we believed it would have been foolish for Texas to unilaterally disarm while other states were offering attractive incentive packages. But now, a temporary shutdown (accompanied by a comprehensive review of the process) would not amount to unilateral disarmament as many states, faced with shortfalls, potentially cut their economic incentives.\par \par \uc2 In Texas, cutting these incentives falls in a growing category as lawmakers try to do as little harm as possible to functions such as education: We hate to do it, but we have to do it.\par \par \uc2 --(equals)\par \par \uc2 The Dallas Morning News. Friday, Feb. 4, 2011\par \par \uc2 No easy economic fix for illegal immigration\par \par \uc2 The latest estimates of America's \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  population should come as a jolt to anyone who thinks bad economic conditions somehow offer a quick fix to the nation's immigration problems. Figures from the Pew Hispanic Center indicate the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  population started growing again even before the nation's economy started showing small signs of recovery.\par \par \uc2 The Obama administration, which pledged last year to redouble the effort for comprehensive immigration reform, gave the issue back-burner status as the recession and growing joblessness caused immigrants to leave. The \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  population peaked at around 12 million in 2007, leveling at around 11.1 million by 2009.\par \par \uc2 But illegal immigration is back on the rise, according to the Pew estimates, just as U.S. unemployment shows signs of dropping and the Dow hovers at 12,000. Last year saw the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  population rise by an estimated 100,000. We shudder to imagine what these numbers will look like next year if economic improvement continues.\par \par \uc2 While other states lost illegal immigrants, Texas, Louisiana and Oklahoma saw an increase of about 240,000 from 2007 to 2010, the Pew study said. If anything, the Texas delegation to Congress should be hopping angry for something to be done -- now -- at the federal level.\par \par \uc2 These dramatic population fluctuations are costly to Americans, particularly at the local level, where school districts, public hospitals and service-oriented businesses must plan their budgets based on immigrant populations that may or may not be there from one year to the next.\par \par \uc2 It's no secret that Texas businesses, especially in the construction and food-service sectors, are heavily reliant on low-cost \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  labor. They know it's wrong, but employers are willing to take the risk of breaking the law in order to keep their businesses afloat. They need a steady, reliable stream of low-cost labor.\par \par \uc2 This situation poses a particular conundrum for conservative politicians who campaigned on get-tough policies toward illegal immigrants, only to find that many of their biggest business contributors do not want the harsh crackdown measures currently being proposed by Texas state legislators.\par \par \uc2 Bill Hammond, who heads the Texas Association of Business, warns that Texas risks attaining Arizona's pariah status if it proceeds with legislation designed to empower local law enforcers to go after suspected illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 "We oppose any state laws on immigration," he told us. "It would be disastrous for Texas. Look at Arizona. Their law has dried up their convention business."\par \par \uc2 Hammond says comprehensive immigration reform is the answer, and this newspaper agrees.\par \par \uc2 The Pew numbers make clear that Texas taxpayers and businesses need a federal response to a federal problem. The worst response is a state legislative package that will drive migrants deeper into the shadows.\par \par \uc2 --(equals)\par \par \uc2 San Antonio Express-News. Wednesday, Feb. 2, 2011\par \par \uc2 Legislature must tackle perpetual deficit\par \par \uc2 If there is any silver lining in the state's budget shortfall, it is that the proposed drastic cuts are focusing the attention of lawmakers and the public on essential government functions and the ways Texas funds them.\par \par \uc2 At the top of the list is the structural shortfall created in 2006 when the Legislature instituted a new business tax to replace revenue lost to a court-ordered restructuring of public school finance that required a reduction in property taxes.\par \par \uc2 The Associated Press reported that John Heleman, the state's chief revenue estimator, told the Senate Finance Committee that while the tax swap was supposed to be revenue neutral, the revenue estimates were faulty. The property tax cuts cost more than anticipated, while the business tax is bringing in one-third less than projected -- only $4 billion annually, versus a projected $6 billion.\par \par \uc2 Part of the overall shortfall can be attributed to the economic downturn since 2008. But even before the recession began, there was good reason to believe the state had created a perpetual revenue shortfall.\par \par \uc2 This structural deficit means the state starts each biennium with a revenue shortfall, which puts pressure on the entire budget.\par \par \uc2 Nowhere is the pressure more evident than in the area of transportation.\par \par \uc2 The state motor fuels tax goes into a supposedly dedicated highway fund. But 25 percent of the highway fund is allocated to shore up funding for public education. Of the remaining balance, lawmakers diverted another $1.15 billion during the current biennium for non-transportation related purposes.\par \par \uc2 The diversions have exacerbated a squeeze on revenue resulting from the fact that the gas tax hasn't been raised in 20 years. With the highway fund strained, Texas has resorted to financing more road projects with bonds.\par \par \uc2 As Gary Scharrer, a veteran in the Express-News Austin bureau reported, the proposed budget for the next biennium will for the first time spend more money for debt service than it does for new road construction. Interest and payments will total $800 million annually, while only $600 million will be available for new roads. That's less money for the entire state than is needed for individual projects in Bexar County.\par \par \uc2 Republican leaders in Austin seem intent on focusing only on the spending side of the ledger in dealing with the budget shortfall. But cuts alone won't address the needs of a growing, vibrant state -- not in public education, and not in transportation infrastructure.\par \par \uc2 --(equals)\par \par \uc2 San Angelo Standard-Times. Saturday, Feb. 5, 2011\par \par \uc2 Thanks for symbolism; now get back to work\par \par \uc2 In a brief glimpse of what the Senate is capable of last week, it voted 81-17 to remove from the health care law an excessively burdensome reporting requirement on business that many realized was a mistake almost as soon as it was enacted.\par \par \uc2 The vote proved that, in a better world, the two parties could work together to improve a needed overhaul of health care.\par \par \uc2 Unfortunately, that vote followed one to repeal the health care law that was doomed from the start and failed on a party-line vote. The Republicans said the vote had symbolic importance and they wanted to get the Democrats on record.\par \par \uc2 That would be fine, except we now face more of the same, and too much symbolism can get in the way of important work.\par \par \uc2 Republicans' best course would be to wait until the challenges to the health care law reach the Supreme Court and hope the justices rule their way. Or they could hope the voters give them control of the Senate with a veto-proof margin in 2012.\par \par \uc2 Instead the Republicans are talking about nickel-and-diming the law to death by blocking the funds needed to implement it, a time-consuming tactic. The Democrats will respond by forcing votes on the law's most popular provisions, just to get the Republicans on record, etc., etc.\par \par \uc2 Here's a better idea: Just do your work. The last Congress, when the Democrats were in full control, didn't. It never passed a budget or the requisite spending bills to run the government, all of which was supposed to have been done by Sept. 30 at the latest.\par \par \uc2 Congress will have to deal with that pile of unfinished business when the last of its temporary measures expires next month. And then comes a critical and contentious vote on raising the debt ceiling.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, Congress should be prepared to go to work on its own budget and readying the 12 spending bills that run the government rather than puttering about with health care because this year they don't have much time to do their regular business.\par \par \uc2 The legislative calendar calls for the House to be in session 123 days over 32 weeks. That doesn't leave a lot of room for doomed "symbolic" votes.\par \par \uc2 --(equals)\par \par \uc2 Lubbock Avalanche-Journal. Sunday, Feb. 6, 2011\par \par \uc2 Obama, Congress need to make call on EPA's expanding its regulating\par \par \uc2 Whether one accepts as fact global warming or is suspect of the science underpinning the position of those certain mankind is about to bake itself, it is difficult to accept federal bureaucrats' deciding sans Congressional directive to start regulating the supposed global warming culprit -- greenhouse gases.\par \par \uc2 The Environmental Protection Agency decided in December 2009 the Clean Air Act of 1972 also covers those greenhouse gases -- specifically carbon dioxide.\par \par \uc2 Interestingly, the Clean Air Act was enacted at a time when scientists were conflicted as to whether the earth was cooling or warming. The concern around 1970 was of global cooling, which was supported by a 35-year trend of cooler temperatures. Scientists then said a culprit in global cooling was smog -- particulate pollution which blocks sunlight. The primary purpose of the Clean Air Act -- aside from preventing us all from choking to death on the smog -- was to clean up the air by reducing particulate pollution.\par \par \uc2 Nearly 40 years later, the pendulum has swung from cooling to warming. The air is cleaner due to the Clean Air Act. Since it did such a good job scrubbing the particulate pollution from smokestacks and automobile exhaust pipes, the EPA has decided it is going to add carbon dioxide to the list of emissions over which it claims dominion.\par \par \uc2 Texas, however, isn't dancing with the bureaucrats this time.\par \par \uc2 There are six legal challenges filed by Texas over the EPA's efforts to force the state to add greenhouse gases to the permitting process. At the heart of those challenges is the state's contention EPA is making up the rules without being authorized to do so by law.\par \par \uc2 Attorney General Greg Abbott, in a letter to President Obama and top Congressional leaders, notes: "on six separate occasions the EPA issued legally flawed regulations based on its misguided claim of authority to unilaterally regulate carbon dioxide."\par \par \uc2 Abbott points out the need for job creation to help turn the dour economy around and questions why EPA is being permitted to chart a regulatory course which both kills jobs and increases consumer and business costs.\par \par \uc2 While legal experts put Texas' odds of winning its war with EPA somewhere close to nil, Abbott hopes the elected folks in D.C. will put the hired guns back in their place.\par \par \uc2 "Under our constitutional system, it is Congress -- not unelected bureaucrats in the EPA -- that should decide whether and how the federal government regulates carbon dioxide emissions," Abbott wrote in his letter to Obama, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and House Speaker John Boehner.\par \par \uc2 If Congress or Obama will rein in the EPA, Abbott wrote, Texas will dismiss its legal challenges, allowing both EPA and Texas to refocus their efforts on what they're supposed to be doing.\par \par \uc2 Regardless of who's right and who's wrong in the debate over global warming, the country's response or absence thereof is the responsibility of its elected leaders. It's about time those who were elected to lead remind the EPA its job is to follow, not strike out on its own.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110207e727002mf\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) - A former state police chief said Friday that Gov. Susana Martinez's directive for immigration checks of criminal suspects shouldn't mean much change for officers who for years have asked about a person's immigration status if there was reason to believe a crime was committed and the information could help in an investigation.\par \par \uc2 During Democratic Gov. Bill Richardson's administration, the state police often would ask about the immigration status of those arrested for crimes and even of some people stopped for traffic violations if they believed a crime had been committed, former chief Faron Segotta told The Associated Press.\par \par \uc2 Segotta, a 28-year state police veteran who retired at the end of December, said he "didn't see a whole lot of change" in the executive order Martinez issued this week requiring state agency law enforcement officers to ask about the immigration status of those arrested for crimes.\par \par \uc2 Some Democratic lawmakers have criticized the governor's directive, saying it could lead to racial profiling.\par \par \uc2 An immigrant rights group plans a rally at the Capitol next week to protest the governor's policy.\par \par \uc2 Martinez, in issuing her directive, rescinded a 2005 executive order by Richardson that she described as a "sanctuary" policy for illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Richardson's executive order barred state law enforcement from asking about the immigration status of someone solely to determine if they were in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 Richardson's directive also prohibited an immigration check of crime victims, witnesses or others seeking assistance or reporting crimes. Martinez's executive order does the same.\par \par \uc2 Segotta said state police "weren't really hamstrung at all" with Richardson's executive order.\par \par \uc2 Segotta was appointed state police chief in 2006 by Richardson and he helped implement the former governor's executive order as adjutant chief.\par \par \uc2 "The executive order didn't really change the way at all the state police did business," said Segotta.\par \par \uc2 He said state police generally wouldn't ask about the immigration status of someone during a routine traffic stop or at the scene of a traffic accident, unless the officer suspected there might be some illegal activity, such as drug trafficking, and the immigration information could be pertinent to the officer's investigation.\par \par \uc2 If a person was arrested, Segotta said, state police would determine an individual's place of birth. If they were a foreign national, he said, they likely would be asked why they were in the United States and the officer would determine whether the person was a fugitive wanted for a crime. When arresting a foreign national, Segotta said, state police would notify the person's consulate.\par \par \uc2 Public Safety Secretary Gorden Eden, who was appointed by Martinez, said an immigration check will be required by state agency law enforcement when someone is booked into a jail after being arrested, usually for a felony.\par \par \uc2 "All we will be doing is adding an additional element to the booking process where we inquire about their immigration status," said Eden.\par \par \uc2 Federal immigration authorities will be notified if the person arrested is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110205e7250002s\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) - Lawmakers in Washington state -- one of two states in the country that still let illegal immigrants obtain driver's licenses -- are moving forward with bills that would ask for proof of legal residency.\par \par \uc2 About half a dozen bills have been introduced in the current session to attempt changes to driver's license requirements. Lawmakers held a hearing on one of the bills Thursday -- the first time that has happened in years.\par \par \uc2 The unprecedented traction has sparked an immigration debate in Olympia -- hitting a high point Thursday when a committee hearing was adjourned early after protesters began yelling that "brown" people were being targeted.\par \par \uc2 Supporters of the stricter immigration rules applauded the lawmakers' efforts, saying that closing access to licenses would stop a magnet for illegal immigrants to move to Washington. Others say Washington's rules allow for identity fraud and other public safety concerns.\par \par \uc2 "Not all illegals come here just to work and look for a better life. Some come here to destroy us and our way of life. Driver's licenses give legitimacy," said Bob West, a man from Yakima, Wash., who testified at the Senate Transportation Committee.\par \par \uc2 Immigrant advocates, meanwhile, say that cutting access to driver's licenses will raise insurance costs because illegal immigrants will be unable to obtain insurance, creating a larger pool of uninsured drivers.\par \par \uc2 They also said that the estimated cost of the bill -- about $1.5 million in the next two-year budget -- is too expensive in a year that the state faces a deficit.\par \par \uc2 "This bill causes terror and a climate of fear in our immigrant members across the state. These are hardworking, tax paying Washington residents who are working the fields every day to support one of our largest industries in the state and many other industries our state desperately needs," said Pramila Jayapal, executive director of OneAmerica. "This bill, we think, represents a misguided attempt to address issues related to our broken immigration system."\par \par \uc2 Jayapal said lawmakers should focus on keeping roads safe.\par \par \uc2 The bill heard Thursday was sponsored by Sen. Mary Margaret Haugen, D-Camano Island. It would require people applying for a driver's license to show proof of Washington residency and a valid Social Security number. If the person does not have a Social Security number, proof of legal residency is required. Under the proposal, the Department of Licensing also is required to verify that a person's address and Social Security numbers are valid.\par \par \uc2 "In order to work in this country you have to have a Social Security number, and we're just asking for the Social Security number," Haugen said at the hearing. "I would hope people aren't working without Social Security numbers. Because if you are, you're part of the underground network, which really creates a lot of problem for a lot of workers."\par \par \uc2 Another bill introduced this year establishes a two-tier system in which illegal immigrants would be able to get a driver's license but couldn't use it as identification. A similar system has been put in place in Utah.\par \par \uc2 New Mexico is the only other state in the country where driver's licenses are available to illegal immigrants. The Associated Press reported last summer that three states -- Washington, New Mexico and Utah -- were seeing surges in the number of immigrants seeking IDs, a trend experts attributed to crackdowns on illegal immigration in Arizona and elsewhere.\par \par \uc2 According to a 2010 Pew Hispanic Center study, estimates of the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  population in Washington state range from 140,000 to 325,000. The state's population is 6.7 million residents.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110204e72400066\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 DENVER (AP) - A fifth effort to grant in-state tuition to illegal immigrants in Colorado is under way in the Legislature, and supporters said Wednesday they've tweaked the proposal so it won't cost the state anything.\par \par \uc2 One Republican lawmaker, however, challenged the no-cost assessment, saying the bill would lead to higher operating costs for colleges.\par \par \uc2 Angela Giron, a first-year Democratic senator from Pueblo, is sponsoring the bill, which she said would dump an estimated $1.7 million to $4.2 million into colleges in the state, depending on how many of the 900 currently eligible \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students enroll in schools.\par \par \uc2 Giron said one of the reasons she ran for office is because she was disappointed that similar legislation failed in 2009.\par \par \uc2 "This legislation holds a huge piece of our future economic success. And finally students (can) dream big dreams and have the chance to make it happen," she said.\par \par \uc2 Eleven states have passed legislation to grant in-state tuition for illegal immigrants, including California, Illinois, Kansas, New York and Texas.\par \par \uc2 Giron said her bill is different than 2009 because it requires students to sign an affidavit with a college saying they are trying to get legal residency, a provision that other states have included in their legislation.\par \par \uc2 Giron said another difference is her bill makes illegal immigrants ineligible for a state stipend that in-state tuition students can use at a college of their choice.\par \par \uc2 To qualify for in-state tuition under the Senate bill, students must graduate or get a GED from a Colorado school and have attended a public or private state school for at least three years.\par \par \uc2 Supporters of the bill, including Rep. Diana DeGette, said during a news conference at the state Capitol that granting in-state tuition to illegal immigrants is a long-term investment for Colorado.\par \par \uc2 High-school students also spoke in favor of the bill, identifying themselves only by their first names because they are in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 Sen. Ted Harvey, a Republican from Highlands Ranch, said the bill rewards illegal behavior and will cost taxpayers, who will pay more for rising operating costs at colleges.\par \par \uc2 "People coming here illegally to take advantage of those programs, we need to stop that," he said.\par \par \uc2 Harvey said the testimony from students was heartbreaking, but he doesn't believe they should be given in-state tuition.\par \par \uc2 "I think we should stop incentivizing more generations of people to cross our borders illegally," he said. "They should come here legally."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Online:\par \par \uc2 Senate Bill 126: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://tinyurl.com/6bey9zd"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://tinyurl.com/6bey9zd}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110203e723000a1\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) - Enlisting Kentucky police in a crackdown on illegal immigrants could cost taxpayers $89 million a year, raising additional objections Wednesday from critics of a proposal that is halfway through the legislative process.\par \par \uc2 Staffers in the Kentucky Legislative Research Commission posted the cost estimate. The legislation would give local and state police agencies broad authority under federal law to check the immigration status of people they stop.\par \par \uc2 State Sen. John Schickel, R-Union, warned that Kentucky may face an even higher cost if it does nothing while other states pass laws that end up forcing illegal aliens to move.\par \par \uc2 "If we do nothing, we risk the danger of becoming a sanctuary state for illegal immigrants," he told the House Local Government Committee.\par \par \uc2 The latest cost estimate is more fodder for critics that say the bill is even tougher than a similar Arizona immigration law that has drawn boycotts and legal challenges.\par \par \uc2 The Kentucky proposal cleared the Senate on a 24-14 vote last month. Supporters argued illegal immigrants, estimated at between 30,000 and 50,000 in Kentucky, sap government services, and using local and state authorities to enforce federal laws could save the state government's social programs some $50 million.\par \par \uc2 House Speaker Greg Stumbo, D-Prestonsburg, and other Democratic leaders have questioned the bill, leaving it to face a dim future.\par \par \uc2 The measure would allow Kentucky law enforcement officers to determine the immigration status of someone who is stopped for another reason, such as a traffic offense, and who is suspected of being an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . The proposal also would allow police to arrest illegal immigrants on trespassing charges for simply setting foot in Kentucky.\par \par \uc2 Richard Tanner, executive director of the Kentucky Magistrates and Commissioners Association, said the legislation would place an unfunded mandate on county governments who would have to pay the cost of holding illegal immigrants in jail until they would get reimbursement from the federal government.\par \par \uc2 State Rep. Jim Wayne, D-Louisville, said the LRC estimated the additional cost to county jails at $26 million a year. Wayne, a critical of the legislation, urged his colleagues in the House to closely review the costs before voting on the measure.\par \par \uc2 "I'm really concerned about the numbers I'm seeing before us today," Wayne said.\par \par \uc2 The LRC staff concluded that, with the estimated $50 million in savings to social programs, the actual costs to state and local governments for implementing the bill may be closer to $40 million a year.\par \par \uc2 Schickel dismissed the cost estimates as unreliable.\par \par \uc2 "The cost is indeterminable," he said. "They really don't know."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 The legislation is Senate Bill 6.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110202e72200262\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 LAS VEGAS (AP) - Nevada has the largest share of illegal workers in the nation, with roughly 10 percent of its work force not authorized by the federal government, according to the Pew Hispanic Center, a nonpartisan research group.\par \par \uc2 The report published Tuesday shows a slight jump in illegal workers as Nevada's job market has shrunk amid record unemployment. Nevada's population of illegal workers was 9.4 percent in 2009. The Silver State's unemployment rate has since climbed to 14.5 percent, the highest in the nation.\par \par \uc2 Nevada also has the largest share of illegal immigrants at 7.2 percent. Only 3.7 percent of people in the United States are illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 The Pew Hispanic Center report comes as Nevada lawmakers from both political parties call for legislation that would require employers to verify the immigration status of all job applicants.\par \par \uc2 Assemblyman Pat Hickey, a Reno Republican, said businesses who hire illegal immigrants should be fined. He said his proposed legislation would help replenish the state's diminished coffers and put Nevadans back to work.\par \par \uc2 "I challenge the notion that those are jobs Nevadans wouldn't do anyway," he said. "I think that doesn't necessarily apply anymore."\par \par \uc2 Nevada's tourism-rich economy lured foreign workers for years with promises of plentiful jobs in its construction and service industries. Immigrants urged friends and relatives to relocate to Nevada with their stories of fair wages. Employers fueled the migration, sometimes sending headhunters to Mexico and other Latin American nations to recruit affordable laborers.\par \par \uc2 "They help to put people in contact with landlords and others, where sometimes immigrant workers or migrants could share rent and make living situations affordable," said John Tuman, director of the Latin American Studies Program at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.\par \par \uc2 The density of illegal immigrants in Nevada could stifle serious debate on immigration legislation as Republicans and Democrats try to court Hispanic voters to prepare for the 2012 presidential election, Tuman said.\par \par \uc2 Nevada's illegal immigrants are far from the mightiest immigrant community in the United States. California's 1.85 million illegal workers, for example, are the largest in the nation. But they represent only 9.7 percent of the Golden State's work force.\par \par \uc2 Nevada's illegal workers soared in 2007 before the recession hit, climbing to 240,000 employees. That number dropped to 190,000 in 2010.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110202e722001hn\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

That's down 10,000 from a 2007 count.\par \par \uc2 Pew researchers did not specify a reason for the drop but suggested that the economy and immigration enforcement were factors.\par \par \uc2 An economist at the University of Utah says she's not surprised. Pam Perlich says the end of the construction boom led to job losses in an industry that employed many in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Information from: The Salt Lake Tribune, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.sltrib.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.sltrib.com}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110202e722000f8\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 HOUSTON (AP) - A U.S. Customs and Border Protection agent appeared in a Maine courtroom on Tuesday to hear charges alleging he lied to investigators over his role in a 2005 incident along Texas' border with Mexico in which a would-be \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  drowned.\par \par \uc2 James Peters, 41, was arrested Tuesday in Houlton, Maine, where he is now stationed. He made an initial appearance in a Bangor, Maine, courtroom on a federal indictment charging him with four counts of making false statements to an investigator. A judge allowed Peters to be released on his own recognizance and set his next court date for Feb. 15 in Houston, where he will be tried.\par \par \uc2 A Houston grand jury handed up the indictment last month, but the indictment wasn't unsealed until Tuesday, after Peters' arrest.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors accuse Peters of lying about what led up to the Dec. 14, 2005, drowning death of Carlos Delgadillo Martinez, a Mexican national who was trying to illegally cross into the U.S. with another person on inner tubes near the international bridge in Laredo.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors contend that Peters deliberately flew his helicopter too close to the pair in an attempt to force them back to Mexico using the turbulence from his chopper. They say Delgadillo lost contact with the inner tube he was holding, and that he drowned.\par \par \uc2 A federal public defender who represented Peters at his court appearance Tuesday did not immediately return a call seeking comment.\par \par \uc2 If convicted, Peters faces up to five years in prison. He has worked for Homeland Security since 1997, becoming a helicopter pilot in 2003.\par \par \uc2 A spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorneys' Office in Houston did not immediately return a call on why prosecutors charged him with making false statements, as opposed to a more serious charge.\par \par \uc2 According to the indictment, Border Patrol agents witnessed the alleged incident involving Peters and the pair trying to cross the river. The agents said they saw the helicopter hover at a low altitude over the individuals, coming close to the bridge.\par \par \uc2 Internal radio transmissions indicate Peters told an agent he was going to try to make the individuals "go back," according to the indictment.\par \par \uc2 A Border Patrol agent told investigators the force of the air turbulence from the low flying helicopter's rotor made Delgadillo lose his grip on the flotation device. The body of the Mexican citizen was found later that day near the bridge.\par \par \uc2 When questioned about the incident, Peters told an agent investigating the drowning death that he hadn't come across any illegal immigrants near the bridge, that he never hovered over the immigrants at a low altitude and he had never brought his helicopter to the level of the bridge or below it because of dangers associated with flying at such a low altitude in that area.\par \par \uc2 But a video from a Border Patrol pole camera as well as the helicopter's internal records showed Peters' aircraft was hovering over the river near the bridge at the time the two individuals were in the river, according to the indictment.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writer Clarke Canfield in Portland, Maine, contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110201e721002fa\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) - After a dropoff during the recession, illegal immigrants seeking to sneak across the U.S. border may be ready to move again.\par \par \uc2 A new study released Tuesday finds the number of illegal immigrants living in the U.S. last year was roughly 11.2 million, a number virtually unchanged from 2009. In that year, the level of illegal immigration declined for the first time in two decades, dropping 8 percent from 2007, as a sour economy and stepped-up border enforcement made it harder or less desirable for undocumented workers to enter from Mexico.\par \par \uc2 The number of illegal immigrants in the U.S. labor force also was unchanged last year at 8 million, representing about 5 percent of workers in the U.S., after hitting a peak of 8.4 million in 2007, according to the nonpartisan Pew Hispanic Center, which based its analysis on census survey data.\par \par \uc2 States posting some of the biggest declines in the number of illegal immigrants since 2007 included Florida, New York, Colorado and Virginia. Unauthorized immigrants in three Mountain West states -- Arizona, Nevada and Utah -- also edged lower.\par \par \uc2 In contrast, illegal immigration was on the rise in Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas, with the combined populations of these states increasing from 1.6 million in 2007 to 1.8 million last year, according to the study.\par \par \uc2 Jeffrey S. Passel, a senior demographer at Pew who co-wrote the report, said it was difficult to discern whether the latest numbers were a sign that illegal immigration was back on the upswing. But he noted that over the last two decades, illegal immigration in the U.S. has steadily increased or remained flat during economic downturns -- with the decline in illegal immigrants in 2009 being the exception.\par \par \uc2 "It's still expensive and dangerous to sneak across the border, and the likelihood of being able to find a job in the U.S. is not very good. But things are still better here than in Mexico," Passel said.\par \par \uc2 According to the Pew study, the number of illegal immigrants has risen from roughly 8.4 million estimated in 2000. After the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, illegal immigration was largely unchanged before spiking higher during the mid-decade housing boom. The level of illegal immigrants reached a peak of 12 million in 2007, experts say.\par \par \uc2 Currently, illegal immigrants make up roughly 4 percent of the U.S. population -- a number largely unchanged from previous years.\par \par \uc2 Steve A. Camarota, director of research at the Center for Immigration Studies, a Washington group that advocates tighter immigration policies, said it wasn't surprising that illegal immigration had stopped declining. He predicted the numbers will soon pick up, citing some improvement in the U.S. economy as well as the Obama administration's "promise of legalization to undocumented workers."\par \par \uc2 "There's no reason for these numbers to go down," Camarota said. "Our legal policy remains very permissive, and we're not enforcing the law."\par \par \uc2 Other Pew findings:\par \par \uc2 --Mexicans make up the majority of the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  population at 58 percent, or 6.5 million. They are followed by people from other Latin American countries at 23 percent, or 2.6 million; Asia at 11 percent or 1.3 million; Europe and Canada at 4 percent or 500,000; and African countries and other nations at 3 percent, or 400,000.\par \par \uc2 --The states with the highest percentage of illegal immigrants were Nevada (7.2 percent), California (6.8 percent), Texas (6.7 percent) and New Jersey (6.2 percent).\par \par \uc2 --About 350,000 newborns last year had at least one \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  parent, representing 8 percent of all births. That share is largely unchanged from 2009.\par \par \uc2 The Pew analysis is based on the Census Bureau's Current Population Survey through March 2010. Because the Census Bureau does not ask people about their immigration status, the estimate on illegal immigrants is derived largely by subtracting the estimated legal immigrant population from the total foreign-born population. It is a method that has been used by the government and Pew for many years and is generally accepted.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110201e721001vt\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The decision upholds a February 2010 superior court decision.\par \par \uc2 Police believe Ramos mistook Tony Bologna and his sons, Michael and Matthew, for gang members and then fatally shot them near their San Francisco home in June 2008.\par \par \uc2 Relatives say the victims might be alive if Ramos had been turned over to immigration authorities after earlier arrests when he was a juvenile.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Information from: San Francisco Chronicle, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.sfgate.com/chronicle"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.sfgate.com/chronicle}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110201e721000p2\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Austin American-Statesman. Tuesday, Jan. 25, 2011\par \par \uc2 A union challenged\par \par \uc2 President Barack Obama's second State of the Union address, offered last night to a predictably mixed reaction from a mixed Congress, was not unlike his first State of the Union address, and that means the same old problems are in need of some new solutions.\par \par \uc2 America still is not back to work at adequate levels, and the president knows his nation's future and his political future could depend on progress on that demoralizing issue. The economic challenges remain dire enough to keep two ongoing wars on something of a back burner. Think about it: It's an issue perhaps more defining to America's future than two wars.\par \par \uc2 Such is the state of our union.\par \par \uc2 Obama offered an optimistic vision -- if somewhat short on specifics -- for the next steps in recovering from a recession that ruined many Americans and came close to ruining America.\par \par \uc2 "At stake right now is not who wins the next election -- after all, we just had an election," he said. "At stake is whether new jobs and industries take root in this country, or somewhere else."\par \par \uc2 That's a lot at stake for a nation the president reminded us is in need of one of its periodic economic overhauls.\par \par \uc2 "That's what Americans have done for over 200 years: reinvented ourselves," he said, calling on Congress to scrap billions of dollars "we currently give to oil companies ... (that are) doing just fine on their own. So instead of subsidizing yesterday's energy, let's invest in tomorrow's."\par \par \uc2 Among the issues that got a wave without specifics was illegal immigration, a topic on which Obama went no further than asking for effort. Ditto for a much-needed tax code revision. "I'm asking Democrats and Republicans to simplify the system," he said. "Level the playing field." And he asked for a five-year freeze on non-defense spending, requiring "painful cuts."\par \par \uc2 Peculiarly, his call for a freeze sparked a lukewarm response in the House chamber.\par \par \uc2 Obama acknowledged the new political reality in which he works. Last year's State of the Union address came in the wake of a shocking GOP win in the special election to replace Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy. Last night's speech came in the wake of a November election in which in which voters handed control of the U.S. House to the GOP, forcing Obama to recalculate as he works toward a 2012 re-election campaign.\par \par \uc2 "With their votes, the American people determined that governing will now be a shared responsibility between parties," Obama noted. "New laws will only pass with support from Democrats and Republicans."\par \par \uc2 Perhaps we are best served by laws that pass with bipartisan backing, rather than laws muscled through by the party in power.\par \par \uc2 Overall, Obama offered a reasonable blueprint for progress. All sides should take a critical -- not political -- look at it.\par \par \uc2 "We will move forward together, or not at all," he said, "for the challenges we face are bigger than party and bigger than politics."\par \par \uc2 We give Obama credit for keeping his focus where it should be -- a still-struggling national economy. Even the bright points -- including a Dow Jones Industrial Average now near 12,000 (up from its 10,236 close on the day Obama delivered his 2010 State of the Union address) -- have a dark overtone.\par \par \uc2 Obama nodded to a stock market that "has come roaring back," corporate profits that have increased and an economy in growth mode. But jobs, declared last year's No. 1 focus, must also be this year's top priority.\par \par \uc2 "We measure progress by the success of our people," Obama said, "by the jobs they can find and the quality of life those jobs offer. ... That's the project the American people want us to work on, together."\par \par \uc2 We had a glimpse of that during the recent lame-duck session. More, please.\par \par \uc2 --(equals)\par \par \uc2 Houston Chronicle. Wednesday, Jan. 26, 2011\par \par \uc2 Perry's priorities: While Texas faces draconian budget cuts, Gov. Perry fixates on partisan issues\par \par \uc2 As the 82nd Texas Legislature convened Jan. 11, Gov. Rick Perry wasted no time in identifying the "pressing issues" that face the state. These are areas that deserve the classification of "emergency" items, which means they are a priority for lawmakers to consider during the session's first 30 days.\par \par \uc2 We were prepared for tough austerity measures, since Perry had already vowed to balance the state's budget deficit -- estimated at anywhere from $15 billion to $27 billion -- without raising taxes or dipping into the state's rainy day fund.\par \par \uc2 So we expected our governor to address this sickening shortfall and its implications for education, health care, human services, infrastructure, jobs . in effect, all the areas that determine the quality of our lives.\par \par \uc2 Here's what we heard from Perry that day: "As we tackle pressing issues, such as strengthening private property rights and abolishing sanctuary cities.." Well, not exactly the emergency issues we had in mind. But he was just warming up.\par \par \uc2 In the next several days, he came up with more emergencies: legislation to require a voter to present proof of identification when voting and legislation to provide for a balanced budget amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Then, last Saturday, he added one more -- legislation that would require a woman to undergo a sonogram before electing to have an abortion. "Now our legislature can take fast action on this important bill," he said, "because we all know when it comes to saving lives, every second counts."\par \par \uc2 But where is Perry's sense of urgency when it comes to the thousands of lives that will be adversely affected by his 10 percent across-the-board cuts in essential services and his breezy assurances that "Texans understand the realities of these tight budgetary times"?\par \par \uc2 It comes as no surprise that all of these emergency issues are dear to the hearts of Perry's loyal conservative base, and have little to do with most people's immediate concerns. And most of them would not make for sound legislation even in a robust economy.\par \par \uc2 Sanctuary cities are hard to even define, let alone legislate -- a bad platform for meaningful immigration discussion. Voter identification fraud at polling booths is apparently rare, with most prosecutions the result of mail-in discrepancies, and it hardly qualifies as an urgent issue. Private property rights are certainly important, but hardly an emergency in the next 30 days, and abortion rights are a constant concern, but always good fodder for energizing the base.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, preliminary Senate and House budgets for the next two years call for draconian measures.\par \par \uc2 Both bodies would cut health and human services programs by almost 25 percent. All public education funds would be cut 10 percent by the Senate, 11.5 percent by the House. Public safety and criminal justice would be cut 11 percent by the Senate, 12.7 percent by the House.\par \par \uc2 These are the real emergencies. Shame on Perry, and shame on the majority of legislators who are aiding and abetting him in pushing his cynical priorities yet again instead of tending to the current crisis.\par \par \uc2 --(equals)\par \par \uc2 The Dallas Morning News. Wednesday, Jan. 26, 2011\par \par \uc2 Perry should temper debate over 'sanctuary cities'\par \par \uc2 Gov. Rick Perry has helped ratchet up emotions over illegal immigration by condemning "sanctuary cities" and placing the issue on the emergency legislative agenda. There's no emergency here, but for all the bluster this issue likely will generate, Texas risks gaining the same pariah status as Arizona if radical voices hold sway.\par \par \uc2 Perry understands this issue's divisiveness and should do what he can to ensure that lawmakers don't go overboard in their zeal for a hard-line crackdown.\par \par \uc2 He has warned against going the way of Arizona, which last year gave police broad new powers to detain suspected illegal immigrants and made it a crime not to carry immigration documents at all times.\par \par \uc2 Still, the problem is worthy of the Legislature's attention because many Texans are rightly frustrated by Washington's inaction on comprehensive immigration reform. But whatever law the Legislature passes, it must be carefully considered to ensure that Texas doesn't go off the deep end or usurp federal immigration-enforcement authority.\par \par \uc2 At least one bill before the Legislature seeks harsh, Arizona-style measures, including authorizing police to arrest anyone who merely arouses suspicions of being here illegally. The risk of racial profiling is high.\par \par \uc2 The governor can and should put the brakes on such legislation and exercise a tempering influence. He can start by defining exactly what he means by "sanctuary cities," which implies that some cities are knowingly providing cover for illegal immigrants. If so, he should name them. Illegal immigrants shouldn't enjoy any city-provided legal umbrella.\par \par \uc2 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement already offers programs designed specifically for local law enforcers to assist in identifying illegal immigrants and placing them in federal custody. In fact, all Texas counties currently participate in the federal Secure Communities program, which gives them the power to process arrested suspects' names through a federal database to legally identify illegal immigrants with criminal records. The goal is to have all U.S. cities participating, as well, by 2013.\par \par \uc2 Once the arrest-and-booking process confirms illegal status, ICE takes over. Cities like Irving participate in the Criminal Alien Program, which makes federal officials available on a 24-hour basis to assist local agencies with illegal immigrants identified after committing misdemeanor offenses.\par \par \uc2 It's unrealistic and counterproductive to seek laws aimed at capturing and deporting every \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  in our midst. Texas should make clear, however, that there is no welcome mat here for illegal immigrants. Sanctuary should be reserved for those who respect the law and immigrate legally. Federal law needs to change to make that legal route more accessible.\par \par \uc2 The long-term solution lies in Washington, but until Congress gets serious about comprehensive immigration reform, the Legislature's only realistic option is to make existing federal programs work better for Texas.\par \par \uc2 --(equals)\par \par \uc2 Tyler Courier-Times-Telegraph. Sunday, Jan. 23, 2011\par \par \uc2 Everything's On Table During Crunch Times\par \par \uc2 Sure, it's going to be tough. But Texans have been experiencing tough times for more than two years now, as the Great Recession has forced families and businesses to make harder decisions than they imagined.\par \par \uc2 It's now the Texas Legislature's turn to make the gut-wrenching decisions the private sector -- including families -- have been making. The budget on the table (HB1) includes more than $13.7 billion in spending cuts without increasing taxes or dipping into the Rainy Day Fund.\par \par \uc2 Within House Bill 1, the proposed state budget for the next two years, cuts to public education accounted for about $10 billion. More than $1 billion are reduced for higher education scholarship programs and Medicaid support for seniors in nursing homes or receiving home health care.\par \par \uc2 About 9,600 state employees could lose their jobs within the initial budget.\par \par \uc2 It also would cut community college funding, including funding to four colleges entirely.\par \par \uc2 Those are hard realities. But as we've said in these pages before, welcome to our world.\par \par \uc2 Everything must be on the table for review in a budget crunch like this one, in which the state faces a still-undetermined budget shortfall that state Rep. Chuck Hopson says could range from $15 to $27 billion.\par \par \uc2 That includes promises made to retirees years ago by legislators who are long gone. It may be that the state simply can't afford to maintain the generous retiree programs, which represent checks written by lawmakers who are no longer around to cash them. It's a harsh reality many in the private sector have had to face. Those left standing after these months of hardship believe it's time for government to follow suit and live within its means -- not force us to limit ours even more.\par \par \uc2 Democrats have criticized the budget as "devastating to Texas families and future generations of Texans." But promising entitlements that we can't afford -- and that will eventually break the state, as Medicaid alone will (see Saturday's editorial) -- is as fraudulent as offering stone soup. You remember the story -- only none of the villagers has anything left to add to the pot.\par \par \uc2 It's a new day, a new economy and a new time for Texans. Families who mere months ago were thriving have found themselves in assistance lines, or seeking assistance, hats in hands, from parents and grandparents.\par \par \uc2 Our public servants must take this opportunity not to protect their empires, but to streamline their operations and become more efficient -- just as the private sector, including families, have done.\par \par \uc2 At the state level, we know that efficiencies must be found, cuts must be made, and at the end of the day, it will be ingenuity and creative solutions that will come to the rescue of those families.\par \par \uc2 Yet this is the moment when we have to remind ourselves that government is not the solution to everything. We have seen, and continue to see, churches step in to help not only their own congregations, but those outside their flocks. We've seen neighbors helping neighbors in ways reminiscent of the Great Depression.\par \par \uc2 These are the qualities that define a community - which determine whether a community is mediocre or great. We believe Tyler and East Texas are poised to make a future that generations past and present can be proud of, by reaching out to our fellow man, without looking to government largesse to fix everything.\par \par \uc2 --(equals)\par \par \uc2 Fort Worth Star-Telegram. Tuesday, Jan. 25, 2011\par \par \uc2 David Dewhurst's delusional call for a constitutional convention\par \par \uc2 It looks like Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst intends to prove there is one thing more perilous for good government in Texas than a legislative session, and that is a Legislature with time on its hands.\par \par \uc2 "To use our time efficiently this week, I have asked the Senate to take up SB 14, Voter ID, to protect the integrity of our elections process," Dewhurst said in a Tuesday news release. "Next week, I plan to bring up a resolution calling on Congress to convene a constitutional convention to pass a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution."\par \par \uc2 When he says "use our time efficiently," he means that he and House Speaker Joe Straus have not yet announced their committee assignments, so lawmakers don't really have much to do but sit around dreaming up new laws to make.\par \par \uc2 So this week the Senate has been debating a Voter ID bill, despite not having demonstrated the need or outlined how it will do more good than harm. Still, this one was expected, given that there has been much stir among Republicans and Tea Party members because no Voter ID bill made it out of the Legislature in the last regular session.\par \par \uc2 The call for a national convention to propose amendments to the Constitution is a new one, at least in the last three decades. And in that time, it surely must rank near the top of the worst ideas anyone in any Legislature has conjured up.\par \par \uc2 Article V of the Constitution sets out how that magnificent document can be amended, and state legislatures are allowed to petition Congress to call a national convention for that purpose. If 34 states sign on, Congress has to call the convention.\par \par \uc2 The fact that it hasn't been done -- hasn't even come close -- in well over two centuries has to be testament to the wisdom of such a move.\par \par \uc2 To call a constitutional convention for the purpose of requiring a balanced federal budget seems to some people like a necessary and conservative thing to do, given the $1.3 trillion deficit for the 2010 fiscal year. But some staunch conservatives have protested.\par \par \uc2 Take Eagle Forum founder Phyllis Schlafly (regular readers will note that it is somewhat rare that the Star-Telegram Editorial Board sides with her), who has called the idea "delusionary."\par \par \uc2 "I don't see any James Madisons, George Washingtons, Ben Franklins or Alexander Hamiltons around today who could do as good a job as was done in 1787," Schlafly wrote in 2008, "and I'm very concerned about the politicians who think they can improve on our Founding Fathers."\par \par \uc2 Even people who believe Congress should be required to balance the budget each year should want to avoid attempting to do that through the mechanism of a constitutional convention.\par \par \uc2 Even if another Madison, Washington, Franklin or Hamilton should emerge, other people would raise havoc at the convention for a long list of other causes. That's because Article V places no restrictions on what the convention could propose, saying only "amendments" (plural).\par \par \uc2 The late Supreme Court Chief Justice Warren Burger said it well in a 1988 letter to Schlafly: "Our 1787 Constitution was referred to by several of its authors as a `miracle.' Whatever gain might be hoped for from a new Constitutional Convention could not be worth the risks involved. A new Convention could plunge our Nation into constitutional confusion and confrontation at every turn, with no assurance that focus would be on the subjects needing attention."\par \par \uc2 Dewhurst should drop this turkey and focus on the state's significant needs.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110201e72100087\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) - For the third year in a row, Washington state officials want to save money by putting some inmates who are illegally in the country in federal custody -- essentially speeding up their deportation.\par \par \uc2 Lawmakers on Monday heard a proposal from the Department of Corrections that eases the way prisoners convicted of non-violent crimes are transferred to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody.\par \par \uc2 But immigrant advocates warned that the way the bill is written now may net immigrants who are legally in the country and immigrants who may be able to contest deportation.\par \par \uc2 The proposal, which was part of Gov. Chris Gregoire's budget, is estimated to save about $3 million in the next two-year budget. Lawmakers face a $4.6 billion deficit in that budget.\par \par \uc2 The department's savings estimate was based on an average of about 150 inmates who would qualify under the bill and the time they would serve in the state system.\par \par \uc2 "The policy behind it is that if this individual is going to be deported anyway, and presumably not in our community, the question remains whether it's good expenditure of state funds. to spend funds incarcerating them until they can serve their sentences," said Scott Blonien, assistant secretary at the corrections department.\par \par \uc2 He added that the bill only affects immigrants who have been served a "final order of deportation," which is when a federal immigration judge orders a person removed from the country.\par \par \uc2 Under the bill, Blonien said, an arrest warrant is issued against the inmate shortly after custody is switched to ICE; that way, if the person comes back to the country and is arrested again, they would be flown back to Washington to serve what remains of their sentence.\par \par \uc2 The measure removes part of existing law that requires judges and prosecutors to sign off on the transfer. To underscore his point, Blonien said in a House Ways & Means committee hearing that out of 30 letters asking for a transfer this past year, only once did the prosecutor and judge agree.\par \par \uc2 Jorge Baron, executive director of the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project, an organization that provides legal services to immigrants at the Tacoma detention center, said the scope of the bill is not limited to illegal immigrants, but could affect refugees and lawful permanent residents who may be deportable after a conviction.\par \par \uc2 "Our concern we have with this bill is that it does not include any protections for individuals who may be able to contest deportation even after a final order of deportation has been entered," Baron said, adding that sometimes people are ordered a final order of deportation in absentia.\par \par \uc2 Baron was working with lawmakers to introduce an amendment that would add a 30-day notice before the transfer, to allow inmates to find out if they can fight deportation. He said that the 30-day notice may only cause a small decrease in the targeted savings.\par \par \uc2 Similar efforts to transfer custody of inmates who are illegal immigrants to the federal government failed during the past two years.\par \par \uc2 --------\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  inmates bill is House Bill 1547\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Online:\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.leg.wa.gov"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.leg.wa.gov}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110201e7210007u\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

Only 3.7 percent of people in the United States are illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Nevada's population of illegal workers was 9.4 percent in 2009.\par \par \uc2 The Silver State's unemployment rate has since climbed to 14.5 percent, the highest in the nation.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020110131e71v003fk\par }\par \b \uc2 Search Summary\b0\par \par
