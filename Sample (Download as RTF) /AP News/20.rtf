The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 A sampling of recent editorials from Colorado newspapers:\par \par \uc2 NATIONAL:\par \par \uc2 The Aurora Sentinel, May 3, on how late changes to Arizona immigration bill will have little impact:\par \par \uc2 After-the-fact modifications made to an alarming Arizona immigration law are little more than window dressing tacked on by politicians rightfully worried about what they have unleashed in that state.\par \par \uc2 Amid a growing riot of national and even international protest of the package of measures that seek to expel that state's illegal immigrants, Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer signed amendments to the law requiring police to have reasons other than immigration status for detaining a suspected \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . The law as it was written and signed a few days earlier not only allowed, but required, that police officers question anyone they suspect might be an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . The law still requires all of the state civilian police to seek out and jail anyone who cannot prove their citizenship, but it now states that in doing so, suspects must be exhibiting some behavior that would require the attention of police.\par \par \uc2 It's far too little, too late. The law and all of its worrisome components weren't drafted in a day. That state's Legislature worked for weeks on this onerous measure, purposefully setting civilian police out on a hunt for illegal immigrants whether they encountered them during their normal duties or not. After seeing the astounding international backlash this measure has created, shaken and mistaken Arizona lawmakers and the governor are trying to backpedal on the law by adjusting the packaging.\par \par \uc2 Don't be fooled. This measure requires civilian police to ferret out those in the country illegally, setting up a state where proof of citizenship is required at all times for those who look, speak or act as if they have a family tree with roots in Mexico, Central America, South America, Cuba or even Spain.\par \par \uc2 White Canadians skirting the immigration law have little or nothing to fret. But it still means that if you're in a car pulled over for having a tail light out, and children or anyone else inside the car cannot prove they are U.S. citizens, the law requires that they be confiscated by police and jailed.\par \par \uc2 Clearly, those police with level heads won't regularly be dragging Hispanic children out of cars, but there isn't a scrap of doubt that there will be plenty of police doing just that.\par \par \uc2 The intent of the law is as clear today as it was when it was first signed. State officials believe they have created legislation allowing civilian police to round up illegal immigrants and scare away others as well as future prospects, and they're willing to step all over the rights of every Hispanic citizen in the state to do it.\par \par \uc2 No one has argued that Congress has been remiss in ignoring the immigration problem for far too long, but what Arizona has done is not the answer.\par \par \uc2 While we often speak out against large-scale boycotts because they unintentionally hurt those the boycotts are intended to help, in this case we support that and any effort to drive quickly home to lawmakers everywhere that what Arizona has done is completely unacceptable.\par \par \uc2 Such a strong and unified message makes it clear that this sanctioned racial profiling and civilian police directions harkens to some of the darkest days in U.S. history, days when Jim Crow laws were celebrated ways of alienating blacks and a time during World War II when Japanese-Americans were callously abused by pandemic racism, even while German-Americans went unscathed.\par \par \uc2 Congress must act swiftly to answer the many difficult questions the country's \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  problems have posed, and Arizona officials must act just as swiftly to set this law aside until Congress acts.\par \par \uc2 Editorial: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.aurorasentinel.com/articles/2010/05/03/opinion/editor"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.aurorasentinel.com/articles/2010/05/03/opinion/editor}}}\uc2  als /doc4bddf831f0e0d054862802.txt\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 The Denver Post, April 30, on need for more exploration of clean energy:\par \par \uc2 While crews continued to clean up a nasty, massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, and families mourned the loss of 29 coal miners, the federal government last week took a bold, albeit small, step toward ensuring a cleaner and safer U.S. energy supply.\par \par \uc2 Interior Secretary and former Colorado Sen. Ken Salazar gave the final go ahead, after nine years of rigorous regulatory review, to the nation's first offshore wind farm off the coast of Cape Cod.\par \par \uc2 Even though it's been met with fierce opposition, notably from the late Sen. Edward Kennedy, it's a necessary move as the U.S. weans itself from fossil fuels and foreign oil imports.\par \par \uc2 Known as Cape Wind, it would sprawl across 25 square miles of Nantucket Sound, and developers say the turning turbines will provide 75 percent of the power for Cape Cod, Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard. That's the equivalent of the energy produced by a medium-size coal-fired plant and would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by the equivalent of taking 175,000 cars off the road, The New York Times reported.\par \par \uc2 Salazar's announcement should buoy the country's nascent offshore wind industry, which trails countries in Europe and China that already capture ocean breezes to power homes and businesses.\par \par \uc2 As with any energy exploration, steps must be taken to mitigate environmental impacts, and Salazar promised that would happen.\par \par \uc2 We've supported opening offshore water to oil exploration, especially given the new techniques that allow for it to be done in environmentally friendly ways, but as the oil spill reminds us, extracting fossil fuels can be a dirty, and potentially environmentally devastating, business.\par \par \uc2 Harnessing the power created by strong ocean winds is not only good for the environment, it helps strengthen our national security as we send less money to those hostile countries dripping with oil.\par \par \uc2 Editorial: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.denverpost.com/editorials/ci--14986796"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.denverpost.com/editorials/ci--14986796}}}\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 STATE:\par \par \uc2 The (Grand Junction) Daily Sentinel, May 3, on bill that would revise state's campaign finance law:\par \par \uc2 We have no problem with key provisions of a bill now in the Colorado Senate that attempts to redraw Colorado's campaign finance law in light of a U.S. Supreme Court decision early this year that overturned many limitations on corporate and labor-union campaign spending.\par \par \uc2 Those key provisions in Senate Bill 203 would require corporations or unions to register with the Secretary of State's office within 48 hours of any independent expenditures in excess of $1,000 they have that are used to advocate in behalf of or against a political candidate in this state.\par \par \uc2 That makes a great deal of sense. We have long argued that maximum disclosure should be the main tool in campaign-finance reform. Since the U.S. Supreme Court said labor unions and corporations can legally spend unlimited amounts in elections so long as they don't give directly to candidates' campaigns, it makes sense to establish disclosure rules for that sort of spending.\par \par \uc2 Where we have a problem is with another provision that seeks to prohibit spending by corporations which are more than 50 percent owned by foreign investors. It's far from certain that measure will hold up to Supreme Court scrutiny. Furthermore, as The Denver Post noted, there are any number of corporations with a significant presence in Colorado and an interest in its political future, for which majority ownership is by citizens of other countries.\par \par \uc2 Lose the foreign-ownership provision -- and examine the issue further over the next year -- and SB 203 could be passed before the end of the legislative session this month.\par \par \uc2 Editorial: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.gjsentinel.com/opinion/articles/disclosure(underscore"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.gjsentinel.com/opinion/articles/disclosure(underscore}}}\uc2  not (underscore)new(underscore)restriction\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 The Colorado Springs Gazette, May 1, on some schools' rejection of copies of the Constitution as gifts for students:\par \par \uc2 Douglas Bruce, author of the Taxpayer's Bill of Rights, is a hero to some and a villain to others.\par \par \uc2 At least one Bruce endeavor should get support from friends and detractors. For each of the past four years, Bruce has spent his income from service as a county commissioner, and his short stint as a state representative, to buy copies of the Constitution for each graduating senior in Colorado. He distributes them through a nonprofit he established called Active Citizens Together. Considering the various surveys that show widespread constitutional ignorance among high school students, this can only be good. But when Bruce offers the gift, it is sometimes declined or brushed aside.\par \par \uc2 "They are rude with a capital 'R'. They stall in getting back to us, and they make up excuses," Bruce said.\par \par \uc2 Bruce asks districts to hand out the constitutions to each senior sometime before graduation, and often, he's ignored.\par \par \uc2 "It is against our policy to hand out materials from outside groups," said Robin Adair, community-relations manager for Lewis-Palmer District 38. "These say 'a gift by Active Citizens Together' on the back. That makes it marketing material, which violates our policy."\par \par \uc2 The district has refused to deliver materials for other nonprofits, including the Girls Scouts and Boy Scouts. Adair said the district also balked because the constitutions contain quotes from founders -- including George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, Samuel Adams and John Adams -- that speak about morality, God and religion. Examples supplied by Adair include: "Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people." -- John Adams; "Only a virtuous people are capable of freedom." -- Franklin; "Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports." -- Washington.\par \par \uc2 Adair said district officials offered to make the booklets available on a table of free literature, but Bruce declined.\par \par \uc2 "They need to be put in the hands of seniors before they graduate and leave the school for good," Bruce said.\par \par \uc2 Cherry Creek School District also refused to distribute the booklets. Like D-38, the district has a policy against handing outside materials directly to students.\par \par \uc2 "We would be filling back packs all the time," said Tustin Amole, director of communications for the district.\par \par \uc2 A variety of other districts have been less than enthusiastic about the constitution copies. Bruce ordered 40,000 this year for the roughly 50,000 high school seniors in Colorado. He anticipates having 4,000 copies left over.\par \par \uc2 "They don't want to distribute constitutions, and then they make up a bunch of excuses," Bruce said.\par \par \uc2 Amole insists her district isn't anti-Constitution, or anti-Bruce.\par \par \uc2 "We really don't have time for a conspiracy," Amole said.\par \par \uc2 Probably not. But the gift should be welcomed warmly and handed to each senior. If policies prohibit that, the policies should change. A Constitution, interspersed with quotes from the founders, is not marketing material.\par \par \uc2 Editorial: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.gazette.com/opinion/bruce-97998-taxpayer-author.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.gazette.com/opinion/bruce-97998-taxpayer-author.html}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100504e654002t5\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) - Republican gubernatorial candidates confronted questions Monday about how the GOP has lost eight years of opportunity as the dominant party in a state that now faces deep financial problems. The four candidates debated on South Carolina public television as the party's June 8 primary approaches.\par \par \uc2 All of them pledged to sign tough \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  legislation similar to a new Arizona law that's facing major challenges.\par \par \uc2 "The national government has completely abdicated its responsibility in keeping our borders safe," Attorney General Henry McMaster said. "If we can't keep our borders safe, we're asking for all kinds of problems."\par \par \uc2 U.S. Rep. Gresham Barrett said he would support a similar tough law and state Rep. Nikki Haley noted that she was a co-sponsor of the South Carolina House's version of the Arizona law.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, Lt. Gov. Andre Bauer repeated a claim he made two weeks ago that immigration problems have increased with people living off the government dole. "We have now made it so that their benefits are better than a lot of these labor-intensive jobs and they're not going to do these jobs," Bauer said.\par \par \uc2 When asked to tell voters why the GOP deserves another chance, most of the candidates criticized disgraced Republican Gov. Mark Sanford and said they would do better.\par \par \uc2 Voters "have to understand that for the past eight years we've seen a lot of Republicans that have learned the talking points, but haven't learned the conservative actions associated with those talking points," Haley said. "This is not about how Republicans act, it's about how conservatives act."\par \par \uc2 She said Sanford has spent his time reacting to the Legislature and that the next governor instead must lay out an agenda and persuade legislators to go along with it.\par \par \uc2 McMaster said "the missed opportunities have been abundant in the last eight years, but they also have been missed in the four years prior to that." McMaster pointed to the single term of Democrat Gov. Jim Hodges, who lost a re-election bid to Sanford in 2002. Sanford, limited by law to two terms, leaves office in January.\par \par \uc2 Barrett said he'd do better using personal relationships with lawmakers. Sanford has persistently been criticized for not working with legislators and creating problems for his agenda with stunts.\par \par \uc2 "You can have the best ideas and the most innovative solutions, but if you can't work with people to accomplish that, it's all for naught," Barrett said.\par \par \uc2 Bauer, however, defended Sanford. He's been a frequent Sanford critic and even offered not to run for governor if Sanford would resign in the wake of travel investigations sparked by his tearful admission of a yearlong extramarital affair with an Argentine woman last year. "I don't think the entire eight years under the governor's watch have been a waste. I think he actually had some very valid points," Bauer said. That included efforts to cut taxes, reduce spending and make government run more efficiently, he said.\par \par \uc2 Sanford was in the news again Monday. McMaster released results of a five-month investigation into State Ethics Commission charges involving Sanford's travel and campaign spending practices. McMaster said he didn't find evidence to warrant criminal charges against Sanford.\par \par \uc2 The candidates also were asked about offshore drilling for oil and gas in the wake of the Gulf Coast oil spill. Democrats faced the same question Sunday night in their debate from the same studio with two of three saying they were leery of offshore drilling. The GOP candidates were all decidedly in favor of offshore drilling.\par \par \uc2 "We've got to proceed with caution," Bauer said. The companies operating offshore drilling, he said, would have to use the best technology, head off problems and be held accountable.\par \par \uc2 Haley said an accident shouldn't stop the drive for drilling. If "there's a plane crash, we don't stop all the planes from flying," Haley said.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100504e65400059\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHOENIX (AP) - A proposed legal challenge to Arizona's new immigration law took a hit Monday when the Phoenix city attorney said Mayor Phil Gordon doesn't have the power to challenge it without the support of the City Council.\par \par \uc2 Gordon was hoping to challenge the law requiring local and state law enforcement officers to question people about their immigration status if there's reason to suspect they're in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 After failing to gather enough support from City Council members, Gordon had claimed he could file a lawsuit without their approval.\par \par \uc2 But the legal opinion by City Attorney Gary Verburg said only the City Council has the power to authorize lawsuits.\par \par \uc2 "I just don't think we should be dragging the city of Phoenix and the taxpayers into this when they say they don't want us to file a lawsuit," said Sal DiCiccio, a City Council member who supports the law.\par \par \uc2 Three lawsuits challenging the law were filed last week by the National Coalition of Latino Clergy and Christian Leaders and two police officers, one from Phoenix and the other from Tucson.\par \par \uc2 The officers filed the lawsuit as individuals and weren't challenging the law on behalf of their employers.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, a delegation of local officials from Arizona planned to meet Tuesday in Washington, D.C., with a representative of he U.S. Justice Department's civil rights division to discuss the impact that law will have on the Latino community.\par \par \uc2 Arizonans who plan to attend include Maricopa County Supervisor Mary Rose Wilcox, state Rep. Kyrsten Sinema and the Rev. Saul Montiel of Epworth United Methodist Church in Phoenix.\par \par \uc2 U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder has said the federal government may go to court to challenge the new law.\par \par \uc2 Eliseo Medina, international executive vice president at Service Employees International Union, said the Arizona delegation asked for the meeting to convey a sense of urgency about the need for legal action.\par \par \uc2 State lawmakers who pushed for the new law had cited the fatal shooting of a cattle rancher near the Arizona-Mexico as evidence that border security must be strengthened.\par \par \uc2 A law enforcement official said Monday that a man suspected of killing rancher Robert Krentz more than a month ago was a Mexican who was recently in the U.S.\par \par \uc2 The official said it's not known if the suspect was still in the U.S. and noted the person who killed rancher Robert Krentz more than a month ago wasn't believed to be a U.S. citizen. The official works for an agency that isn't leading the investigation and requested anonymity.\par \par \uc2 Carol Capas, spokeswoman for the Cochise County Sheriff's Office, which is leading the investigation, declined to confirm the account.\par \par \uc2 Krentz was on his all-terrain vehicle checking water lines and fencing when he was shot March 27 on his 35,000-acre ranch northeast of Douglas, Ariz. The wounded rancher managed to speed away before he lost consciousness and died.\par \par \uc2 At a congressional hearing last month, Cochise County Sheriff Larry Dever said the rancher was believed to have been killed by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who was headed to Mexico and worked as a scout for drug smugglers.\par \par \uc2 Scouts generally serve as mountaintop lookouts for drug smugglers, instructing the drivers for smuggling rings to pull over and hide when authorities are nearby.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100503e653003a3\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ROGERS, Ark. (AP) - Another state's controversial law cracking down on illegal immigrants is renewing a familiar debate in Arkansas about what the state should do with those who are here illegally.\par \par \uc2 The issue is an attractive one for election-year politics, but whether it will translate into a major policy shift in Arkansas is a cloudier question.\par \par \uc2 A group of Arkansas lawmakers is looking at proposing an anti-illegal immigration law similar to one that was just enacted in Arizona. The Arizona law requires local and state law enforcement to question people about their immigration status if there's reason to suspect they're in the country illegally. It also makes it a state crime to be in the United States illegally.\par \par \uc2 The law already faces legal challenges and a backlash from opponents who claim it is unconstitutional and will lead to racial profiling of Hispanics. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder has said the federal government may challenge the law, and President Barack Obama has called the law misguided.\par \par \uc2 The measure has emboldened Republicans in Arkansas to push for more stringent immigration measures. That's especially true in the 3rd congressional district in northwest Arkansas, where eight candidates are vying for the GOP nomination.\par \par \uc2 The one who may benefit the most from the immigration debate is Rogers Mayor Steve Womack, who has made immigration enforcement part of his focus as the top elected official in his northwest Arkansas city.\par \par \uc2 "The immigration phenomenon here is the direct result of the federal government, a Congress and a president -- and it goes back to Bush and Clinton -- that failed in their capacity to uphold the laws of this country and to secure this border," Womack said in interview in his office last week.\par \par \uc2 Womack said the shooting of an undercover Rogers police officer while serving a warrant on an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  spurred him to push for the city's inclusion in a U.S. Immigration and Custom Enforcement program that allows local and state police officers to perform immigration checks and take part in operations in the field.\par \par \uc2 But the city's focus on immigration enforcement has also faced racial profiling concerns. In 2003, Hispanic motorists sued the city claiming police racially profiled them. A settlement required police to form a committee that would meet at least twice a year to discuss efforts to improve relations with the Hispanic community.\par \par \uc2 Womack and the other Republicans running for the 3rd District seat say they want immigration reform that focuses first on securing the borders and enforcing the country's immigration laws. Chances that the federal government will step in anytime soon seem slim, with Obama saying lawmakers may lack the "appetite" to take on immigration while they are up for re-election.\par \par \uc2 At the state level, the appetite among Republican lawmakers isn't the problem. It's the political clout.\par \par \uc2 Rep. John Burris, who said he's working with a group of lawmakers on a potential proposal, said he's not sure how much the measure they're crafting will look like Arizona's law. He said that one concern is addressing the racial profiling questions that have been raised by Arizona's law.\par \par \uc2 "We've got to do something. Anybody looking at the problems we're facing as a state right now has to understand that we've got to do something," said Burris, R-Harrison. "What we're doing right now isn't working."\par \par \uc2 Efforts to push for stricter immigration measures have mostly fizzled in the Legislature and among voters. Secure Arkansas, a grass-roots organization, couldn't gather enough votes in 2008 to place on the ballot a measure that would have required state government agencies to verify that all those seeking benefits are legal U.S. residents.\par \par \uc2 The measure faced opposition from Gov. Mike Beebe, who said it would duplicate laws that are already on the books.\par \par \uc2 The group, which is trying again to get the same measure on this fall's ballot, won a small victory last year with its opposition to legislation would have granted the children of illegal immigrants in-state tuition rates at Arkansas colleges and universities. The state Senate ultimately rejected the proposal, which had also faced opposition from Beebe and the state's higher education director.\par \par \uc2 Beebe has taken a different approach from his predecessor, Republican Mike Huckabee, on immigration. While Huckabee championed the idea of in-state tuition -- as well as scholarships -- for the children of illegal immigrants, Beebe was a vocal opponent.\par \par \uc2 But Beebe's been unwilling to push for the strict measures that Secure Arkansas and conservative Republicans in the Legislature want, saying it would be too much of a financial burden.\par \par \uc2 "The first questions remain -- if you want the state to take a bigger role in doing the federal government's job, how do you want to pay for it; and what taxes do you want to raise? We hope that any proposals we see contain those answers," Beebe spokesman Matt DeCample said.\par \par \uc2 Opponents of laws like Arizona's say they do agree that it's a signal that the federal government needs to take up immigration, but they say it's dangerous to view the measure as one that could gain support in Arkansas.\par \par \uc2 "I'm not sure the climates of the two states are the same," said Steve Copley, a Methodist minister and activist on immigration issues. "I'm not sure that the people of this state are willing to be that punitive to people at this point."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 DeMillo covers Arkansas government and politics for The Associated Press.\par \par \uc2 9\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100502e652000hl\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc5}{\*\bkmkend toc5}\b \uc2 Fresh out of prison, will former congressman Traficant try to make a run for his old seat?\b0\par\par\uc2 By MEGHAN BARR   \par \uc2 Associated Press Writer\par \uc2 1,566 \uc2 words\par \uc2 2 May 2010\par 00:01\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2010.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 BOARDMAN, Ohio (AP) - A hero of the tea party movement is seated in a corner booth at his favorite diner, his famous toupee sticking out above the wooden slats like a warning. That mop of hair, possibly more famous than the man himself, tells the regulars bent over coffee mugs all they need to know: Jimbo has entered the building.\par \par \uc2 He has arrived, as usual, with an entourage. But ever since he was released from prison last fall, Jim Traficant's entourage is more befitting of an elderly grandparent being eased to and from doctor's appointments than the blustering politician he once was. His assistants are old friends whose loyalty he has counted on over the years, as he tumbled from the House floor on Capitol Hill to the sports room at a prison in Minnesota, where he bided his time cheering on the Los Angeles Lakers with his buddies and painting watercolor landscapes of barns beneath full-mooned skies.\par \par \uc2 Anxiously, the entourage watches as their leader doodles all over a piece of loose-leaf paper, then folds the paper twice and abruptly shoves it under a place mat. Traficant is liable to storm out of here at any moment, as every beating heart in this eggs-and-bacon place knows. Patience is not one of his strong suits.\par \par \uc2 This is the man who once compared the U.S. Congress to a bunch of prostitutes -- then publicly apologized to prostitutes for comparing them to the U.S. Congress. This is the man who, while defending himself against a House ethics committee, told lawmakers that he would like to "kick them in the crotch." This is a man who, according to his friends, claims that his ancestors are from Transylvania, making him a distant relation of Dracula.\par \par \uc2 Above all, though, this is the man who will decide, come Monday, whether he will yet again make a run for Congress, this time as a felon who was convicted of racketeering and bribery and as an independent proudly bearing the mantle of the tea party. The notion of a convicted felon running for Congress might seem slightly preposterous. But here, in the gloomy ruins of shuttered steel mills, the name Traficant reminds people of better times.\par \par \uc2 And weird times.\par \par \uc2 The man has a gift, if you can call it that, for one-liners. And on this morning he fires off more than a few, if only to prove that after seven years of confinement, Jimbo's still Jimbo.\par \par \uc2 "I don't know how many years it's gonna take," he says, "but America will implode similar to the Soviet Union. Stevie Wonder could see it coming."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 During the 17 years that Traficant represented northeast Ohio, his penchant for outlandish outfits irked his fellow lawmakers almost as much as the speeches he gave about everything from cow manure to Janet Reno. For this trip to the diner, just minutes from his home, he has selected a white turtleneck, his trademark yellow-tinted glasses and a pair of baggy sweat pants held up by a brown leather belt.\par \par \uc2 He talks for nearly two hours in stream-of-consciousness fashion, hardly stopping to take a breath, repeatedly referring to himself in the third person.\par \par \uc2 In his own mind, at least, Jim Traficant is still on trial.\par \par \uc2 "They had no physical evidence against Traficant," he says, leaning over the table. "Seven people said they bribed him. They had no crime against Traficant. They taped every phone call he ever made, probably. Since 1983."\par \par \uc2 He ticks off names and dates and federal dollars down to the decimal point, boasting about his accomplishments. But mostly, he rails against the panoply of people and institutions he's mad at: the IRS, primarily, but also the federal government in general, Democrats, Republicans, the Department of Energy, Communists, illegal immigrants, Socialists, the tax code, the Justice Department, the media and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi.\par \par \uc2 All of which makes him a natural fit for the tea party, which was just getting started when Traficant emerged from prison to a "Jimbo"-themed welcome, replete with Elvis impersonators. Since then, he's been a frequent keynote speaker at tea party town hall events throughout his old stomping grounds.\par \par \uc2 His former congressional district has been split in two, both currently represented by Democrats up for re-election: Rep. Tim Ryan, a homegrown congressman who worked for Traficant many years ago, and Rep. John Boccieri. If he does run, Traficant must decide which district would pose a less insurmountable race.\par \par \uc2 "I don't have a dime, don't even have a campaign account," he admits. "I haven't run no polls. And most of the people who have money are probably afraid to give me money. Damn IRS will probably audit them."\par \par \uc2 So why run? Traficant may have been sidelined for a while, but he still knows how to play the game. Besides, he already ran for Congress from prison once -- and managed to win nearly 20 percent of the vote.\par \par \uc2 Oh, and he's got a platform, too.\par \par \uc2 "Repeal the 16th amendment, abolish the Internal Revenue Service," he declares. "No more corporation tax, no more Social Security, no more Medicare taxes. No more audits. No more deadlines. No more tax courts. And everybody pays."\par \par \uc2 In a nation under The Traficant Plan, as he calls it, every \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  would be thrown out and troops would be stationed at the border. A flat 25 percent consumption tax would be instituted. The Department of Energy and the Department of Education would go the way of the Confederate dollar.\par \par \uc2 And finally -- and here the bravado falls away, and suddenly there's anguish in his eyes -- something must be done about America's prisons. Where he spent the better part of a decade, refusing to accept visitors or a reduced sentence. Where he made many friends, one of whom called him from Haiti after the earthquake.\par \par \uc2 "He says, 'I can't talk long, I just wanna let you know I'm OK,'" Traficant says with a bit of pride. "Just a friend. And I was glad to hear from him."\par \par \uc2 Technically, he's not supposed to keep in touch with pals who are still behind bars, but he admits that he does hear -- "occasionally, circuitously" -- from certain ones.\par \par \uc2 "I met some great people," he says. "And they're doing much more time than they should've got."\par \par \uc2 And so the final tenet of the Traficant platform is rather stark in its simplicity, and surprising even for a man of many polarizing ideas: Let them go home.\par \par \uc2 "These nonviolent offenders," he says, "instead of spending all that money in prison, send 'em home. You don't need to be in prison in America like this."\par \par \uc2 But that, of course, won't interfere with his plan to punish every last person who helped put him away.\par \par \uc2 "I'm going after a few people that perpetrated a crime against me and before it's over that's gonna be resolved," he says. "See and these sons of bitches gotta pay for that. You understand?"\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Daylight is fading fast outside an auction barn in the tiny town of Rogers, Ohio, where about 150 people on folding chairs are listening raptly to Traficant as he hits the sweet spot in his speech, the part where he really lets the government have it.\par \par \uc2 In the throes of a speech, Traficant is many things all at once: Traficant The Victim. Traficant The Congressman. Traficant The Sage.\par \par \uc2 "The missiles are all that's keeping us together," he warns. "So help me God, if the dollar fails."\par \par \uc2 He points at his audience accusingly. He growls into the microphone.\par \par \uc2 "God Almighty, the corporation tax!" he shouts. "Get rid of the IRS!"\par \par \uc2 There is spontaneous applause. A cell phone rings and someone scrambles to shut it off.\par \par \uc2 "That's probably the IRS now," Traficant says. Everybody laughs.\par \par \uc2 "I hope not, Jim!" a man yells out.\par \par \uc2 In Youngstown, some would like to see Traficant quietly disappear, says William Binning, a professor of political science at Youngstown State University. They believe he is an embarrassment to a rough-and-tumble place that's trying to plant fledgling shoots of prosperity in the ground. To them, he is an unsightly splotch on an already stained past.\par \par \uc2 "But I run into lots of people -- they're Jim fans," Binning says. "And they want him to run. And they're going to vote for him."\par \par \uc2 Behind the podium, a woman named Anita Fraser glows as she watches Traficant on the microphone. Fraser is the tea party's head organizer for several counties in northeast Ohio and eastern Pennsylvania. Shyly, she points to a brightly colored poster laying on a table.\par \par \uc2 "Did I show you the painting Jim gave me?" she says.\par \par \uc2 The subject of the piece is a curvaceous cartoon woman in a formfitting tank top and cowboy hat, a muscular arm hugging her hip. Her eyes are heavy, blue-lidded. Her lips are dark and garish. Her chest is huge.\par \par \uc2 There's something familiar about her face. A satiric rendering of a female politician whom Traficant reviles? A lighthearted sendup of a staff member?\par \par \uc2 "Oh," Fraser says. "Can't you tell? It's Madonna."\par \par \uc2 9\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100502e652000b3\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ATLANTA (AP) - Jessica Colotl studied hard and dreamed of becoming a lawyer but her plans were put on hold about a month ago when she was arrested for driving without a license and sent to an immigration detention center.\par \par \uc2 Colotl, a 21-year-old senior at Kennesaw State University in suburban Atlanta, was pulled over for a minor traffic violation. After her arrest, she was taken to an immigration detention center in Alabama and on Tuesday a judge denied her bond, said sorority sister Lila Parra.\par \par \uc2 "My heart just breaks," Parra said. "She fought so hard and did so well academically and to get shut down in her senior year, it's just not fair."\par \par \uc2 Colotl's parents brought her to the U.S. when she was 10. Two of her three younger siblings were born here and are American citizens, Parra said.\par \par \uc2 Parra and about 30 other Lambda Theta Alpha sorority members from several different universities joined a rally at the Georgia Capitol Saturday to march and rally in favor of federal immigration reform. The event was one of many planned around the country to protest a strict new immigration law in Arizona and to call on lawmakers to reform federal immigration laws. The rallies were held May 1 because it's a traditional day of protest and International Workers Day.\par \par \uc2 Police and organizers estimated that about 5,000 people participated. Protesters carried American flags and signs demanding legalization for the estimated 12 million illegal immigrants living in the U.S. and an end to deportations.\par \par \uc2 State Rep. Pedro Marin, one of a handful of Hispanic members of the Georgia Legislature, addressed the rally Saturday, calling on the crowd to register to vote and to actually cast ballots to ensure that lawmakers hear their voices.\par \par \uc2 "We cannot allow Georgia to turn into Arizona," Marin said, referring to the new law in Arizona that makes it a state crime to be in the U.S. illegally and lets police question anyone they suspect of being an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The Arizona law's passage has galvanized immigrant rights groups across the country, prompting calls to boycott Arizona businesses and protests outside Arizona Diamondbacks baseball games.\par \par \uc2 Many in Arizona support the law amid growing anger over the federal government's failure to secure the border. The state has become a major gateway for drug smuggling and human trafficking from Mexico.\par \par \uc2 In the final days of the legislative session this week, the Georgia Senate passed a resolution to urge Washington to secure the borders because Georgia "is unable to withstand the financial burden created by illegal immigration." The resolution urges President Barack Obama and Congress to devote more resources to tightening immigration control.\par \par \uc2 Cabinet maker Fernando Baltazar, 25, came to the Atlanta rally with his wife, Evelina. He arrived in the U.S. 10 years ago on a work visa but didn't leave after it expired.\par \par \uc2 "I think the marches are very important because we want the people in Congress to hear us," Baltazar said in Spanish. "We need immigration reform because there are so many of us here who just want to work and want to be able to do that legally."\par \par \uc2 Coral Aguirre, 32, was born in the U.S. after her mother crossed the border illegally from Mexico so her children would have a better life. She lives in Woodstock in suburban Atlanta, and attended the Saturday rally at the Capitol as she has in past years.\par \par \uc2 "My mother came here illegally and is now legal, so I wanted to come out and support those who don't have a voice," she said.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100502e652000ah\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 LOS ANGELES (AP) - Tens of thousands of demonstrators galvanized by opposition to Arizona's tough law marched through the streets of downtown Los Angeles to demand an overhaul of immigration laws, some holding signs calling for a boycott of the Grand Canyon State.\par \par \uc2 Singer Gloria Estefan kicked off the march by climbing on a flatbed truck to say that illegal immigrants should not be considered criminals. She said the United States was a nation of immigrants.\par \par \uc2 "We're honest people, we're good people," the Cuban-born singer said. "We've given a lot to this country. This country has given a lot to us."\par \par \uc2 Cardinal Roger Mahony stood on the truck and joined the crowd in chanting, "Si, se puede," or "Yes, we can," in Spanish. Streets and sidewalks were packed with tens of thousands of people as horns blared.\par \par \uc2 The march ended nearly five hours later after a steady stream of politicians and labor leaders stepped on stage on a perfect spring afternoon to denounce the Arizona law and insist that President Barack Obama tackle immigration reform.\par \par \uc2 "We say no to Arizona, no to racism, no to hate," said Janice Hahn, a Los Angeles city councilwoman and Democratic candidate for California lieutenant governor.\par \par \uc2 Police officials estimated about 50,000 demonstrators took to the streets at the rally's peak in the early afternoon.\par \par \uc2 Police had prepared for an anticipated 100,000 people, and a ground force of officers on foot, bicycles and motorcycles were making patrols.\par \par \uc2 Two people were arrested near the march route, one for vandalism and one for public drunkenness, but Officer Karen Rayner said neither suspect seemed to have been connected to the rally.\par \par \uc2 She said shouting matches broke out between the marchers and a small group of counterprotesters, but none of them led to violence.\par \par \uc2 "It was a peaceful event today," Rayner said.\par \par \uc2 Organizers handed out T-shirts that read, "Legalize Arizona" and "Boycott Arizona." Marchers waved American flags, along with flags from other countries, including Mexico, the Philippines, Nicaragua and Guatemala. Hot dog and ice cream vendors wheeled carts along with the crowd.\par \par \uc2 David Cho, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Korea and a student at University of California, Los Angeles, drew loud cheers when he said he dreamed of joining the Air Force and becoming a U.S. senator.\par \par \uc2 "I feel like I'm living inside an invisible prison cell," he said.\par \par \uc2 Many came to protest Arizona's new law requiring local and state law enforcement officers to question people about their immigration status if there's reason to suspect they're in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 "If they see someone with black hair and Latino face, they're going to stop you without any reason and ask for your papers," said Eleazar Cruz, 37, a Los Angeles bartender from Mexico who paid a smuggler $300 to cross the border illegally in San Diego in 1985 and later became a legal resident. "It's crazy."\par \par \uc2 Cruz participated in a massive May 1 pro-immigration march in 2006 -- upset at the time by a proposed federal crackdown on illegal immigration -- but was too busy to attend the annual marches since then. The Arizona law brought him back.\par \par \uc2 "We're angry," he said.\par \par \uc2 Oswaldo Osorio, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Mexico who paid his smuggler $150 to cross the border in San Diego 18 years ago, turned out with his wife, also in the U.S. illegally, and their two U.S.-born daughters. All four waved American flags.\par \par \uc2 Osorio, 38, said his family wanted to make a statement for giving immigrants legal status and protesting Arizona's law.\par \par \uc2 Benjamin Hernandez, 44, attended his first political rally since coming to the United States illegally 10 years ago. He lived in Arizona for two years after paying a smuggler $1,200 to walk across the desert, then moved to Ventura to join his father, where he works construction jobs.\par \par \uc2 Hernandez said his nephews in Arizona are upset by the law but won't leave the state.\par \par \uc2 "I won't go visit them," he said. "They can come visit me. After working so hard, why would I want to lose everything?"\par \par \uc2 There were few dissenting voices. Demonstrators ignored a man who stood silently on a sidewalk as they walked past him with a sign that read, "Balance the Budget. Deport Illegal Aliens."\par \par \uc2 In San Francisco, about two dozen counterprotesters stood behind a barricade at the city's Civic Center, separated from pro-immigration rights supporters across the street by a line of officers.\par \par \uc2 The counterprotesters carried signs that read, "We Support Arizona" and "We Need More Ice At This Fiesta," an apparent reference to the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.\par \par \uc2 Art Brown, 68, a member of the tea party movement, said illegal immigrants were undercutting his pool service business.\par \par \uc2 "They're not paying income tax. They're not paying business licenses, so it's an uneven playing field," the Redwood City resident said.\par \par \uc2 Gary Wade, 60, and his wife, Lynette, said they supported Arizona's law. The Oakland couple said illegal immigrants were using services that should be going to legal residents.\par \par \uc2 "If they want to ask me to show a driver's license, I'm fine with it," Lynette, referring to the Arizona law, said.\par \par \uc2 "A criminal would not want that," her husband, Gary, added.\par \par \uc2 Police were out in force, lining the route as the loud pro-immigration rights crowd chanted and carried signs reading "Full Rights For All Immigrants" and "Arizona's Racist Law, We Say No!"\par \par \uc2 Juan Carlos Esteban, 37, a member of the United Service Workers West union, said he felt the need to protest the Arizona legislation.\par \par \uc2 "That's a step backward for the whole nation," he said of the law. "It's a human rights issue."\par \par \uc2 Noe Madrigal, 32, came out with 15 friends. He said only two of them were in the country legally.\par \par \uc2 "That new law in Arizona is very unfair," Madrigal said. "That's racism."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writer Sudhin Thanawala contributed to this report from San Francisco.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100502e65200032\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc8}{\*\bkmkend toc8}\b \uc2 Arizona law sparks calls for action on immigration\b0\par\par\uc2 By SOPHIA TAREEN   \par \uc2 Associated Press Writer\par \uc2 1,023 \uc2 words\par \uc2 2 May 2010\par 07:52\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2010.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 CHICAGO (AP) - Protesters across the United States vented their anger over a new Arizona law to crack down on illegal immigrants, calling on President Barack Obama to immediately take up their cause for federal immigration reform.\par \par \uc2 From Los Angeles to Washington D.C., activists, families, students and even politicians marched, practiced civil disobedience and "came out" about their citizenship status in the name of rights for immigrants, including the estimated 12 million living illegally in the U.S.\par \par \uc2 Obama once promised to tackle immigration reform in his first 100 days, but has pushed back that timetable several times. He said this week that Congress may lack the "appetite" to take on immigration after going through a tough legislative year. However, Obama and Congress could address related issues, like boosting personnel and resources for border security, in spending bills this year.\par \par \uc2 A congressman was among 35 people arrested during a protest at the White House. U.S. Rep. Luis Gutierrez, a Democrat from Illinois, was taking part in a civil disobedience demonstration.\par \par \uc2 Protests elsewhere were largely peaceful. No arrests were reported at most demonstrations; two were arrested near the march route in Los Angeles, but police said neither suspect appeared to be connected to the rally.\par \par \uc2 Police said 50,000 rallied in Los Angeles, where singer Gloria Estefan kicked off a massive downtown march. Estefan spoke in Spanish and English, proclaiming the United States is a nation of immigrants.\par \par \uc2 "We're good people," the Cuban-born singer said atop a flatbed truck. "We've given a lot to this country. This country has given a lot to us."\par \par \uc2 Anger, particularly among immigrant rights activists, has been building since last week when Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer signed the legislation. The law requires local and state law enforcement to question people about their immigration status if there's reason to suspect they're in the country illegally. It also makes it a state crime to be in the United States illegally.\par \par \uc2 The law's supporters say it's necessary because of the federal government's failure to secure the border, but critics contend it encourages racial profiling and is unconstitutional.\par \par \uc2 "It's racist," said Donna Sanchez, a 22-year-old U.S. citizen living in Chicago whose parents illegally crossed the Mexican border. "I have papers, but I want to help those who don't."\par \par \uc2 Organizers estimated about 20,000 gathered at a park on Chicago's West Side and marched, but police said about 8,000 turned out.\par \par \uc2 "I want to thank the governor of Arizona because she's awakened a sleeping giant," said labor organizer John Delgado, who attended a rally in New York where authorities estimated 6,500 gathered.\par \par \uc2 Chicago's event resembled something between a family festival -- food vendors strolled through with pushcarts -- and a political demonstration with protesters chanting "Si se puede," Spanish for "Yes we can." A group of undocumented students stood on a stage at the park and "came out" regarding their immigration status.\par \par \uc2 Juan Baca was among those students. Baca, 19, whose parents brought him from Mexico illegally when he was 4 months old, said he has had to drop out of college and work several times already because he can't qualify for financial aid.\par \par \uc2 "It's been a struggle," he said. "I missed the mark by four months."\par \par \uc2 In Dallas, police estimated at least 20,000 people turned out. About a dozen people carried signs depicting the Arizona governor as a Nazi and Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his tough illegal immigration stance, as a Klansman. Organizers were asking sign holders to discard those placards.\par \par \uc2 Juan Hernandez, the Hispanic outreach coordinator for Arizona Sen. John McCain's unsuccessful presidential run, attended the Dallas rally. He said Arizona was once considered by those south of the border to be a model state with particularly close ties to Mexico.\par \par \uc2 "It went beyond what most states do," he said. "Now they are a state that goes beyond what the Constitution says you should do."\par \par \uc2 Juan Haro, 80, was born and raised in Denver, where about 3,000 people rallied. He said he thinks Arizona's new law targets Mexicans.\par \par \uc2 "This country doesn't seem to be anti-immigrant," said Haro, whose family is originally from Mexico. "It seems to be anti-Mexican."\par \par \uc2 In downtown Miami, several hundred flag-waving demonstrators -- many with Cuban and Honduran flags, but mostly American ones -- called for reforms.\par \par \uc2 Elsewhere, an estimated 7,000 protesters rallied in Houston, about 5,000 gathered at the Georgia state Capitol in Atlanta and at least 5,000 marched in Milwaukee. About 3,000 attended a Boston-area march.\par \par \uc2 And in Ann Arbor, Michigan, more than 500 people held a mock graduation ceremony for undocumented immigrant students near the site of Obama's University of Michigan graduation speech.\par \par \uc2 In Arizona, police in Tucson said an immigrant rights rally there drew at least 5,000 people. Several thousand people gathered in Phoenix for a demonstration Saturday evening.\par \par \uc2 A smattering of counterprotesters showed up at rallies. In Tucson, a few dozen people showed up in support of the new law and Brewer. A barricade separated about two dozen counterprotesters from a pro-immigrant rights rally in San Francisco.\par \par \uc2 Counterprotesters there carried signs that read, "We Support Arizona" and "We Need More Ice At This Fiesta," an apparent reference to the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.\par \par \uc2 May 1 -- International Workers Day -- is a traditional date for political demonstrations. Immigration advocates latched onto that tradition in 2006, when more than 1 million people across the country -- half a million alone in Chicago -- protested federal legislation that would have made being an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  a felony. That legislation ultimately failed.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writers Samantha Abernethy in Denver, Christine Armario in Miami, Kate Brumback in Atlanta, Mark Carlson in Phoenix, Russell Contreras in Chelsea, Massachusetts, Kathleen Miller in Washington, Danny Robbins in Dallas, Ula Ilnytzky in New York, Dinesh Ramde in Milwaukee, Elliot Spagat in Los Angeles and Sudhin Thanawala in San Francisco contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100502e6520001f\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 CHICAGO (AP) - His surgically repaired knee finally healed, Alfonso Soriano no longer worries when he steps to the plate.\par \par \uc2 Now, the burden is on opposing pitchers.\par \par \uc2 Soriano homered, Derrek Lee delivered the go-ahead two-run single and the Chicago Cubs rallied from three down again to beat the Arizona Diamondbacks 7-5 on Saturday.\par \par \uc2 Soriano's two-run shot off former Cubs pitcher Bob Howry in the seventh tied it at 5, and Lee made it 7-5 with a two-run bases-loaded single in the eighth off Juan Gutierrez (0-3).\par \par \uc2 "I'm working hard to make the fans happy," said Soriano, who's often booed at home.\par \par \uc2 Not this time, though.\par \par \uc2 Not after his second big homer in the past two days. His drive and Lee's big hit made a winner of Sean Marshall (1-1), who pitched two scoreless innings before Carlos Marmol escaped a tense ninth with his fourth save in five chances.\par \par \uc2 He caught his right ankle on a small hole throwing his first pitch to Cole Gillespie and walked him to lead off the inning. Justin Upton singled with one out and Mark Reynolds -- who hit two solo homers -- walked with two out to load the bases, but Marmol struck Adam LaRoche.\par \par \uc2 "Marmol's got exceptional stuff, and he's got a big, big heart and pitches with confidence to go along with good stuff," manager Lou Piniella said. "He makes it a little difficult on himself at times."\par \par \uc2 To that, Marmol said, "I don't want to make it exciting."\par \par \uc2 There was enough excitement before he stepped on the mound.\par \par \uc2 Early on, about a dozen protesters outside Wrigley Field handed out leaflets blasting Arizona's new immigration law that makes it a state crime to be in the U.S. illegally and lets police question anyone they suspect of being an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . The protesters were headed to a larger rally in downtown Chicago.\par \par \uc2 Inside the old ballpark, the Diamondbacks were making plenty of noise with their bats before the Cubs rallied.\par \par \uc2 Cubs starter Carlos Silva allowed eight hits over five innings in his shortest outing of the year. His ERA rose from 1.73 to 2.90.\par \par \uc2 Reynolds hit his eighth and ninth homers, tying teammate Kelly Johnson for the league lead. Upton went deep, but Arizona blew a three-run lead for the second straight day, the bullpen again breaking down and the surging Soriano coming up with another big blow.\par \par \uc2 Afterward, manager J.J. Hinch laid into his bullpen, saying, "It's a collective group that needs to regain their competitive edge."\par \par \uc2 Reynolds didn't hold back, either.\par \par \uc2 "We've got some guys who've proven themselves, veterans," he said. "I keep saying I hope they snap out of it. I hope they do for the sake of the team and for the sanity of a lot of guys in here."\par \par \uc2 Soriano's tying shot off Howry in the seventh came after he hit the go-ahead three-run homer in Friday's 11-5 win. He also singled and is now 20 for 55 over his last 17 games.\par \par \uc2 Soriano's homer came after a 3-1 pitch on the outside corner that he thought was ball four. Instead, it was strike two, but no problem.\par \par \uc2 He knocked the ball deep into the left-center bleachers for his fourth homer.\par \par \uc2 "People don't realize how hurt he was last year," Lee said.\par \par \uc2 Soriano batted .241 a year ago before missing the final month and having knee surgery, but he's feeling better.\par \par \uc2 "That's the most important thing," he said. "I don't think about the knee."\par \par \uc2 Arizona would just as soon forget about this.\par \par \uc2 In the eighth, Gutierrez walked Ryan Theriot and Kosuke Fukudome as a wave swept through the stands to load the bases before Lee, who came in with a .205 average, singled past a diving Reynolds at third to make it 7-5.\par \par \uc2 Arizona starter Dan Haren allowed 10 hits -- the most for him since Aug. 30, 2008 -- over six innings. Haren also had two hits, leading off the third with a double and scoring the game's first run.\par \par \uc2 NOTES: Theriot had two singles to extend his hitting streak to 11 games. ... RHP Esmailin Caridad, on the 15-day disabled list with a strained right forearm, could rejoin the Cubs by next weekend "if everything is right," manager Lou Piniella said. Caridad was scheduled to pitch Saturday in Arizona and would likely make several appearances for Triple-A Iowa. When he's activated, he'll replace one of the Cubs' younger relievers, Piniella said, meaning Carlos Zambrano will remain in the bullpen for now.\par \par \uc2 5\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100501e651003sf\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 LOS ANGELES (AP) - Tens of thousands of demonstrators galvanized by opposition to Arizona's tough law marched through the streets of downtown Los Angeles to demand an overhaul of immigration laws, some holding signs calling for a boycott of the Grand Canyon State.\par \par \uc2 Singer Gloria Estefan kicked off the march by climbing on a flatbed truck to say that illegal immigrants should not be considered criminals. She said the United States was a nation of immigrants.\par \par \uc2 "We're honest people, we're good people," the Cuban-born singer said. "We've given a lot to this country. This country has given a lot to us."\par \par \uc2 Cardinal Roger Mahony stood on the truck and joined the crowd in chanting, "Si, se puede," or "Yes, we can," in Spanish. Streets and sidewalks were packed with tens of thousands of people as horns blared.\par \par \uc2 The march ended nearly five hours later after a steady stream of politicians and labor leaders stepped on stage on a perfect spring afternoon to denounce the Arizona law and insist that President Barack Obama tackle immigration reform.\par \par \uc2 "We say no to Arizona, no to racism, no to hate," said Janice Hahn, a Los Angeles city councilwoman and Democratic candidate for California lieutenant governor.\par \par \uc2 Police officials estimated about 50,000 demonstrators took to the streets at the rally's peak in the early afternoon.\par \par \uc2 Police had prepared for an anticipated 100,000 people, and a ground force of officers on foot, bicycles and motorcycles were making patrols.\par \par \uc2 Two people were arrested, one for vandalism and one for public drunkenness, Los Angeles Police Officer Cleon Joseph said.\par \par \uc2 "Overall everything was extremely peaceful," Joseph said. "Very well done by everybody."\par \par \uc2 Organizers handed out T-shirts that read, "Legalize Arizona" and "Boycott Arizona." Marchers waved American flags, along with many from other countries, including Mexico, the Philippines, Nicaragua and Guatemala. Hot dog and ice cream vendors wheeled carts along with the crowd.\par \par \uc2 David Cho, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Korea and a student at University of California, Los Angeles, drew loud cheers when he said he dreamed of joining the Air Force and becoming a U.S. senator.\par \par \uc2 "I feel like I'm living inside an invisible prison cell," he said.\par \par \uc2 Many came to protest Arizona's new law requiring local and state law enforcement officers to question people about their immigration status if there's reason to suspect they're in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 "If they see someone with black hair and Latino face, they're going to stop you without any reason and ask for your papers," said Eleazar Cruz, 37, a Los Angeles bartender from Mexico who paid a smuggler $300 to cross the border illegally in San Diego in 1985 and later became a legal resident. "It's crazy."\par \par \uc2 Cruz participated in a massive May 1 pro-immigration march in 2006 -- upset at the time by a proposed federal crackdown on illegal immigration -- but was too busy to attend the annual marches since then. The Arizona law brought him back.\par \par \uc2 "We're angry," he said.\par \par \uc2 Oswaldo Osorio, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Mexico who paid his smuggler $150 to cross the border in San Diego 18 years ago, turned out with his wife, also in the U.S. illegally, and their two U.S.-born daughters. All four waved American flags.\par \par \uc2 Osorio, 38, said his family wanted to make a statement for giving immigrants legal status and protesting Arizona's law.\par \par \uc2 Benjamin Hernandez, 44, attended his first political rally since coming to the United States illegally 10 years ago. He lived in Arizona for two years after paying a smuggler $1,200 to walk across the desert, then moved to Ventura to join his father, where he works construction jobs.\par \par \uc2 Hernandez said his nephews in Arizona are upset by the law but won't leave the state.\par \par \uc2 "I won't go visit them," he said. "They can come visit me. After working so hard, why would I want to lose everything?"\par \par \uc2 There were few dissenting voices. Demonstrators ignored a man who stood silently on a sidewalk as they walked past him with a sign that read, "Balance the Budget. Deport Illegal Aliens."\par \par \uc2 In San Francisco, about two dozen counterprotesters stood behind a barricade at the city's Civic Center, separated from pro-immigration rights supporters across the street by a line of officers.\par \par \uc2 The counterprotesters carried signs that read, "We Support Arizona" and "We Need More Ice At This Fiesta," an apparent reference to the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.\par \par \uc2 Art Brown, 68, a member of the tea party movement, said illegal immigrants were undercutting his pool service business.\par \par \uc2 "They're not paying income tax. They're not paying business licenses, so it's an uneven playing field," the Redwood City resident said.\par \par \uc2 Gary Wade, 60, and his wife, Lynette, said they supported Arizona's law. The Oakland couple said illegal immigrants were using services that should be going to legal residents.\par \par \uc2 "If they want to ask me to show a driver's license, I'm fine with it," Lynette, referring to the Arizona law, said.\par \par \uc2 "A criminal would not want that," her husband, Gary, added.\par \par \uc2 Police were out in force, lining the route as the loud pro-immigration rights crowd chanted and carried signs reading "Full Rights For All Immigrants" and "Arizona's Racist Law, We Say No!"\par \par \uc2 Juan Carlos Esteban, 37, a member of the United Service Workers West union, said he felt the need to protest the Arizona legislation.\par \par \uc2 "That's a step backward for the whole nation," he said of the law. "It's a human rights issue."\par \par \uc2 Noe Madrigal, 32, came out with 15 friends. He said only two of them were in the country legally.\par \par \uc2 "That new law in Arizona is very unfair," Madrigal said. "That's racism."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writer Sudhin Thanawala contributed to this report from San Francisco.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100501e651003kt\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ATLANTA (AP) - Jessica Coltl studied hard and dreamed of becoming a lawyer but her plans were put on hold about a month ago when she was arrested for driving without a license and sent to an immigration detention center.\par \par \uc2 Coltl, a 21-year-old senior at Kennesaw State University in suburban Atlanta, was pulled over for a minor traffic violation. After her arrest, she was taken to an immigration detention center in Alabama and on Tuesday a judge denied her bond, said sorority sister Lila Parra.\par \par \uc2 "My heart just breaks," Parra said. "She fought so hard and did so well academically and to get shut down in her senior year, it's just not fair."\par \par \uc2 Coltl's parents brought her to the U.S. when she was 10. Two of her three younger siblings were born here and are American citizens, Parra said.\par \par \uc2 Parra and about 30 other Lambda Theta Alpha sorority members from several different universities joined a rally at the Georgia Capitol Saturday to march and rally in favor of federal immigration reform. The event was one of many planned around the country to protest a strict new immigration law in Arizona and to call on lawmakers to reform federal immigration laws. The rallies were held May 1 because it's a traditional day of protest and International Workers Day.\par \par \uc2 Police and organizers estimated that about 5,000 people participated. Protesters carried American flags and signs demanding legalization for the estimated 12 million illegal immigrants living in the U.S. and an end to deportations.\par \par \uc2 State Rep. Pedro Marin, one of a handful of Hispanic members of the Georgia Legislature, addressed the rally Saturday, calling on the crowd to register to vote and to actually cast ballots to ensure that lawmakers hear their voices.\par \par \uc2 "We cannot allow Georgia to turn into Arizona," Marin said, referring to the new law in Arizona that makes it a state crime to be in the U.S. illegally and lets police question anyone they suspect of being an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The Arizona law's passage has galvanized immigrant rights groups across the country, prompting calls to boycott Arizona businesses and protests outside Arizona Diamondbacks baseball games.\par \par \uc2 Many in Arizona support the law amid growing anger over the federal government's failure to secure the border. The state has become a major gateway for drug smuggling and human trafficking from Mexico.\par \par \uc2 In the final days of the legislative session this week, the Georgia Senate passed a resolution to urge Washington to secure the borders because Georgia "is unable to withstand the financial burden created by illegal immigration." The resolution urges President Barack Obama and Congress to devote more resources to tightening immigration control.\par \par \uc2 Cabinet maker Fernando Baltazar, 25, came to the Atlanta rally with his wife, Evelina. He arrived in the U.S. 10 years ago on a work visa but didn't leave after it expired.\par \par \uc2 "I think the marches are very important because we want the people in Congress to hear us," Baltazar said in Spanish. "We need immigration reform because there are so many of us here who just want to work and want to be able to do that legally."\par \par \uc2 Coral Aguirre, 32, was born in the U.S. after her mother crossed the border illegally from Mexico so her children would have a better life. She lives in Woodstock in suburban Atlanta, and attended the Saturday rally at the Capitol as she has in past years.\par \par \uc2 "My mother came here illegally and is now legal, so I wanted to come out and support those who don't have a voice," she said.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100501e651003k3\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc13}{\*\bkmkend toc13}\b \uc2 Fresh out of prison, will former congressman Traficant try to make a run for his old seat?\b0\par\par\uc2 By MEGHAN BARR   \par \uc2 Associated Press Writer\par \uc2 1,583 \uc2 words\par \uc2 1 May 2010\par 12:16\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2010.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 BOARDMAN, Ohio (AP) - A hero of the tea party movement is seated in a corner booth at his favorite diner, his famous toupee sticking out above the wooden slats like a warning. That mop of hair, possibly more famous than the man himself, tells the regulars bent over coffee mugs all they need to know: Jimbo has entered the building.\par \par \uc2 He has arrived, as usual, with an entourage. But ever since he was released from prison last fall, Jim Traficant's entourage is more befitting of an elderly grandparent being eased to and from doctor's appointments than the blustering politician he once was. His assistants are old friends whose loyalty he has counted on over the years, as he tumbled from the House floor on Capitol Hill to the sports room at a prison in Minnesota, where he bided his time cheering on the Los Angeles Lakers with his buddies and painting watercolor landscapes of barns beneath full-mooned skies.\par \par \uc2 Anxiously, the entourage watches as their leader doodles all over a piece of loose-leaf paper, then folds the paper twice and abruptly shoves it under a place mat. Traficant is liable to storm out of here at any moment, as every beating heart in this eggs-and-bacon place knows. Patience is not one of his strong suits.\par \par \uc2 This is the man who once compared the U.S. Congress to a bunch of prostitutes -- then publicly apologized to prostitutes for comparing them to the U.S. Congress. This is the man who, while defending himself against a House ethics committee, told lawmakers that he would like to "kick them in the crotch." This is a man who, according to his friends, claims that his ancestors are from Transylvania, making him a distant relation of Dracula.\par \par \uc2 Above all, though, this is the man who will decide, come Monday, whether he will yet again make a run for Congress, this time as a felon who was convicted of racketeering and bribery and as an independent proudly bearing the mantle of the tea party. The notion of a convicted felon running for Congress might seem slightly preposterous. But here, in the gloomy ruins of shuttered steel mills, the name Traficant reminds people of better times.\par \par \uc2 And weird times.\par \par \uc2 The man has a gift, if you can call it that, for one-liners. And on this morning he fires off more than a few, if only to prove that after seven years of confinement, Jimbo's still Jimbo.\par \par \uc2 "I don't know how many years it's gonna take," he says, "but America will implode similar to the Soviet Union. Stevie Wonder could see it coming."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 During the 17 years that Traficant represented northeast Ohio, his penchant for outlandish outfits irked his fellow lawmakers almost as much as the speeches he gave about everything from cow manure to Janet Reno. For this trip to the diner, just minutes from his home, he has selected a white turtleneck, his trademark yellow-tinted glasses and a pair of baggy sweat pants held up by a brown leather belt.\par \par \uc2 He talks for nearly two hours in stream-of-consciousness fashion, hardly stopping to take a breath, repeatedly referring to himself in the third person.\par \par \uc2 In his own mind, at least, Jim Traficant is still on trial.\par \par \uc2 "They had no physical evidence against Traficant," he says, leaning over the table. "Seven people said they bribed him. They had no crime against Traficant. They taped every phone call he ever made, probably. Since 1983."\par \par \uc2 He ticks off names and dates and federal dollars down to the decimal point, boasting about his accomplishments. But mostly, he rails against the panoply of people and institutions he's mad at: the IRS, primarily, but also the federal government in general, Democrats, Republicans, the Department of Energy, Communists, illegal immigrants, Socialists, the tax code, the Justice Department, the media and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi.\par \par \uc2 All of which makes him a natural fit for the tea party, which was just getting started when Traficant emerged from prison to a "Jimbo"-themed welcome, replete with Elvis impersonators. Since then, he's been a frequent keynote speaker at tea party town hall events throughout his old stomping grounds.\par \par \uc2 His former congressional district has been split in two, both currently represented by Democrats up for re-election: Rep. Tim Ryan, a homegrown congressman who worked for Traficant many years ago, and Rep. Charlie Wilson. He has also weighed running against Rep. John Boccieri, who represents a neighboring district to the west. If he does run, Traficant must decide which district would pose a less insurmountable race.\par \par \uc2 "I don't have a dime, don't even have a campaign account," he admits. "I haven't run no polls. And most of the people who have money are probably afraid to give me money. Damn IRS will probably audit them."\par \par \uc2 So why run? Traficant may have been sidelined for a while, but he still knows how to play the game. Besides, he already ran for Congress from prison once -- and managed to win nearly 20 percent of the vote.\par \par \uc2 Oh, and he's got a platform, too.\par \par \uc2 "Repeal the 16th amendment, abolish the Internal Revenue Service," he declares. "No more corporation tax, no more Social Security, no more Medicare taxes. No more audits. No more deadlines. No more tax courts. And everybody pays."\par \par \uc2 In a nation under The Traficant Plan, as he calls it, every \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  would be thrown out and troops would be stationed at the border. A flat 25 percent consumption tax would be instituted. The Department of Energy and the Department of Education would go the way of the Confederate dollar.\par \par \uc2 And finally -- and here the bravado falls away, and suddenly there's anguish in his eyes -- something must be done about America's prisons. Where he spent the better part of a decade, refusing to accept visitors or a reduced sentence. Where he made many friends, one of whom called him from Haiti after the earthquake.\par \par \uc2 "He says, 'I can't talk long, I just wanna let you know I'm OK,'" Traficant says with a bit of pride. "Just a friend. And I was glad to hear from him."\par \par \uc2 Technically, he's not supposed to keep in touch with pals who are still behind bars, but he admits that he does hear -- "occasionally, circuitously" -- from certain ones.\par \par \uc2 "I met some great people," he says. "And they're doing much more time than they should've got."\par \par \uc2 And so the final tenet of the Traficant platform is rather stark in its simplicity, and surprising even for a man of many polarizing ideas: Let them go home.\par \par \uc2 "These nonviolent offenders," he says, "instead of spending all that money in prison, send 'em home. You don't need to be in prison in America like this."\par \par \uc2 But that, of course, won't interfere with his plan to punish every last person who helped put him away.\par \par \uc2 "I'm going after a few people that perpetrated a crime against me and before it's over that's gonna be resolved," he says. "See and these sons of bitches gotta pay for that. You understand?"\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Daylight is fading fast outside an auction barn in the tiny town of Rogers, Ohio, where about 150 people on folding chairs are listening raptly to Traficant as he hits the sweet spot in his speech, the part where he really lets the government have it.\par \par \uc2 In the throes of a speech, Traficant is many things all at once: Traficant The Victim. Traficant The Congressman. Traficant The Sage.\par \par \uc2 "The missiles are all that's keeping us together," he warns. "So help me God, if the dollar fails."\par \par \uc2 He points at his audience accusingly. He growls into the microphone.\par \par \uc2 "God Almighty, the corporation tax!" he shouts. "Get rid of the IRS!"\par \par \uc2 There is spontaneous applause. A cell phone rings and someone scrambles to shut it off.\par \par \uc2 "That's probably the IRS now," Traficant says. Everybody laughs.\par \par \uc2 "I hope not, Jim!" a man yells out.\par \par \uc2 In Youngstown, some would like to see Traficant quietly disappear, says William Binning, a professor of political science at Youngstown State University. They believe he is an embarrassment to a rough-and-tumble place that's trying to plant fledgling shoots of prosperity in the ground. To them, he is an unsightly splotch on an already stained past.\par \par \uc2 "But I run into lots of people -- they're Jim fans," Binning says. "And they want him to run. And they're going to vote for him."\par \par \uc2 Behind the podium, a woman named Anita Fraser glows as she watches Traficant on the microphone. Fraser is the tea party's head organizer for several counties in northeast Ohio and western Pennsylvania. Shyly, she points to a brightly colored poster laying on a table.\par \par \uc2 "Did I show you the painting Jim gave me?" she says.\par \par \uc2 The subject of the piece is a curvaceous cartoon woman in a formfitting tank top and cowboy hat, a muscular arm hugging her hip. Her eyes are heavy, blue-lidded. Her lips are dark and garish. Her chest is huge.\par \par \uc2 There's something familiar about her face. A satiric rendering of a female politician whom Traficant reviles? A lighthearted sendup of a staff member?\par \par \uc2 "Oh," Fraser says. "Can't you tell? It's Madonna."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100501e65100315\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 MONTGOMERY, Alabama (AP) - An "English-only" ad by a candidate in the Alabama governor's race has drawn the state into the national debate over immigration stoked by a tough new Arizona law and generated an Internet crowd for the political scion running in a crowded Republican field.\par \par \uc2 The ad by construction business owner and candidate Tim James -- viewed more than 500,000 times on \uc2 YouTube\uc2  since its release last week -- is also generating criticism from rivals and advocates that it could reverse years of economic development based on luring foreign companies, including carmakers from Germany, Japan and South Korea.\par \par \uc2 James, son of former two-term Alabama governor Fob James Jr., says in the ad that he would drop the practice of giving the state drivers license exam in 12 languages other than English.\par \par \uc2 "This is Alabama. We speak English. If you want to live here, learn it," James says.\par \par \uc2 In James' view, it will make highways safer, save the state money, and hasten the assimilation of legal immigrants into Alabama society.\par \par \uc2 The ad comes as members of both parties in Congress maneuver to either add or duck immigration as a midterm election issue and as immigration advocates file legal challenges a new Arizona law that makes being an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  a state crime enforced by police.\par \par \uc2 Critics say James' idea is counterproductive in a state that has received substantial help from 358 foreign businesses to build a manufacturing base that includes Mercedes-Benz, Hyundai and Honda auto assembly plants. They point to 40 other states -- including every one in the Southeast -- that compete with Alabama for new industry give the test in multiple languages.\par \par \uc2 State officials don't have numbers tracking how many foreigners work in the state. Many of them are managers, engineers and other high-salary employees who may have non-English speaking spouses. In 2000, according to the last U.S. Census, there were 108,000 people in Alabama, or 2.9 percent of the state's population, who spoke a language other than English at home.\par \par \uc2 Bill Johnson, a Republican rival of James in the June 1 primary, said his opponent's ad is not good for business development.\par \par \uc2 "If Tim wanted to attack illegal immigration, I wish he would have just said so," said Johnson, who as a member of he current governor's Cabinet helped put together Alabama's industrial recruitment program. "Instead, I believe his ad sent the wrong signal and possibly insulted thousands of our legal international citizens and business partners." Johnson said.\par \par \uc2 Isabel Rubio, executive director of the Hispanic Interest Coalition of Alabama, says the change would reduce safety because people will continue to drive whether they pass the exam in English or not. It's in the best interest of all motorists for the state to license as many safe drivers as possible, regardless of their primary language, she said.\par \par \uc2 ProEnglish, an organization from Arlington, Virginia, that advocates English-only exams, sued the state three years ago to end the exam in multiple languages. Alabama's current governor and attorney general, Republicans Bob Riley and Troy King, successfully defended the state against the suit.\par \par \uc2 James' ad has resonated with voters concerned about illegal immigration and stood him apart from a crowded Republican field where all seven candidates are running on a standard Republican platform of low taxes and less government.\par \par \uc2 "We have definitely hit a nerve with Alabamians and people across the country," James said. "What's happening in Washington and Arizona has only amplified the people's awareness of the issue and their wariness of government to make the right decisions."\par \par \uc2 James did not originate the idea. A Republican legislator tried to pass an English-only bill in Alabama in 2008, but was blocked by Senate Democrats. Similar legislation is pending in Tennessee and Georgia, where the state Senate has already passed the measure.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100501e651002ql\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 CHICAGO (AP) - Angered by a controversial Arizona immigration law, tens of thousands of protesters -- including 50,000 alone in Los Angeles -- rallied in cities across America demanding that President Barack Obama tackle immigration reform immediately.\par \par \uc2 "I want to thank the governor of Arizona because she's awakened a sleeping giant," said labor organizer John Delgado who attended a rally in New York where authorities estimated 6,500 gathered.\par \par \uc2 From Los Angeles to Washington D.C., activists, families, students and even politicians marched, practiced civil disobedience and "came out" about their citizenship status in the name of rights for immigrants, including the estimated 12 million living illegally in the U.S.\par \par \uc2 Police said 50,000 rallied in Los Angeles, where singer Gloria Estefan kicked off a massive downtown march. Estefan spoke in Spanish and English, proclaiming the United States is a nation of immigrants.\par \par \uc2 "We're good people," the Cuban-born singer said atop a flatbed truck. "We've given a lot to this country. This country has given a lot to us."\par \par \uc2 Public outcry, particularly among immigrant rights activists, has been building since last week when Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer signed the legislation last week. Supporters say the law is necessary because of the federal government's failure to secure the border, but critics contend it encourages racial profiling and is unconstitutional.\par \par \uc2 "It's racist," said Donna Sanchez, a 22-year-old U.S. citizen living in Chicago whose parents illegally crossed the Mexican border. "I have papers, but I want to help those who don't."\par \par \uc2 Organizers estimated about 20,000 gathered at a park on Chicago's West Side and marched, but police said about 8,000 turned out.\par \par \uc2 The event resembled something between a family festival -- with food vendors pushing carts through the grass -- and a political demonstration with protesters chanting "Si se puede," Spanish for "Yes we can." A group of undocumented students stood on a stage at the Chicago park and "came out" regarding their immigration status.\par \par \uc2 Juan Baca was among those students. Baca, 19, whose parents brought him from Mexico illegally when he was 4 months old, said he has had to drop out of college and work several times already because he can't qualify for financial aid.\par \par \uc2 "It's been a struggle," he said. "I missed the mark by four months. A lot of times you feel like you're not good enough."\par \par \uc2 Obama once promised to tackle immigration reform in his first 100 days, but has pushed back that timetable several times. He said this week that Congress may lack the "appetite" to take on immigration after going through a tough legislative year. However, Obama and Congress could address related issues, like boosting personnel and resources for border security, in spending bills this year.\par \par \uc2 "Obama promised legalization in the first 100 days," said Jesus Garzas, a 43-year-old Chicagoan with legal status who wore an Obama mask with a Pinocchio-like nose. "He lied."\par \par \uc2 Juan Haro, 80, was born and raised in Denver, where about 3,000 people rallied. He said his family is originally from Mexico and thinks Arizona's new law is targeting Mexicans specifically.\par \par \uc2 "This country doesn't seem to be anti-immigrant," he said. "It seems to be anti-Mexican."\par \par \uc2 At the White House, U.S. Rep. Luis Gutierrez, an Illinois Democrat, was arrested with several others in a demonstration of civil disobedience against the Arizona law.\par \par \uc2 In Dallas, police estimated at least 20,000 attended a Saturday rally.\par \par \uc2 Among them was Juan Hernandez, the Hispanic outreach coordinator for Sen. John McCain's unsuccessful presidential run. He said Arizona was once considered by those south of the border to be a model state with particularly close ties to Mexico.\par \par \uc2 "It went beyond what most states do," he said. "Now they are a state that goes beyond what the Constitution says you should do."\par \par \uc2 About a dozen people at the Dallas event carried signs depicting Brewer as a Nazi and Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his tough illegal immigration stance, as a Klansman. Organizers were asking sign holders to discard the placards.\par \par \uc2 In Ann Arbor, Michigan, more than 500 people held a mock graduation ceremony for undocumented immigrant students near the site of Obama's University of Michigan commencement speech.\par \par \uc2 A smattering of counterprotesters showed up at rallies. In Tucson, Arizona, a few dozen people from the group Arizonans For Immigration Control showed up in support of the new law and Brewer.\par \par \uc2 May 1, also International Workers Day, is a traditional date for political demonstrations. Immigration advocates latched onto that tradition in 2006, when more than 1 million people across the country -- half a million alone in Chicago -- protested federal legislation that would have made being an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  a felony. That legislation ultimately failed.\par \par \uc2 At Saturday's rallies, activists from organizations supporting other groups -- including Muslims, gays and youth advocacy -- marched in support of immigrant rights.\par \par \uc2 "It affects everyone," said Paulie Sabol, 38, who traveled from Indiana to march in Chicago. His partner is a Mexican immigrant who is a legal resident but doesn't have U.S. citizenship. "I can't sponsor him because same sex marriage isn't recognized in Indiana."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writers contributing to this report include Elliot Spagat in Los Angeles, Danny Robbins in Dallas, Ula Ilnytzky in New York and Samantha Abernethy in Denver.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100501e651001ef\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 CHICAGO (AP) - Immigrant rights activists hope Arizona's controversial immigration law will spark enormous crowds of people to protest in rallies nationwide and add urgency to pleas for federal immigration reform.\par \par \uc2 Dozens of marches are planned for Saturday in cities across the country from Los Angeles to Dallas to New York.\par \par \uc2 "What happened in Arizona proves that racism and anti-immigrant hysteria across the country still exists. We need to continue to fight," said Lee Siu Hin, a coordinator with the Washington, D.C.-based National Immigrant Solidarity Network.\par \par \uc2 Activists believe opposition to Arizona's new law -- which requires authorities to question people about immigration status if there's reason to suspect they're in the country illegally -- could be the catalyst needed to draw record-breaking crowds similar to those four years ago.\par \par \uc2 That's when more than a million people across the country united to fight federal legislation considered anti-immigrant. Though the bill, which would have made being an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  a felony, was unsuccessful, it triggered massive marches across the nation.\par \par \uc2 Since then, the movement has fractured and attendance has dropped sharply as attempts to reform federal immigration policy fizzled. In 2006, nearly half a million people took to Chicago's streets. Last year, fewer than 15,000 participated in the rallies, held annually on May 1 because it's a traditional day of protest and International Workers Day.\par \par \uc2 But after the Arizona law was signed into law last week, immigration reform advocates have seen a flurry of activity.\par \par \uc2 Relying on online social networking, churches and ethnic media to mobilize, activists have called for a boycott of Arizona businesses and protested outside Arizona Diamondbacks baseball games. Earlier in the week, two dozen activists chanting "Illinois is not Arizona" were arrested for blocking traffic outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in suburban Chicago.\par \par \uc2 While supporters say the law is necessary because of the federal government's failure to secure the border and growing anxiety over crime related to illegal immigration, critics say it's unconstitutional and encourages racial profiling and discrimination against immigrants or anyone thought to be an immigrant.\par \par \uc2 Activists fear that without federal legislation in place to address the estimated 12 million illegal immigrants living in the U.S., other states will follow Arizona's lead and pass similar legislation.\par \par \uc2 "If Republicans and Democrats do not take care of this albatross around our necks, this will in fact be the undoing of many, many years of civil rights struggle in this country," said Jorge-Mario Cabrera, a spokesman for the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles, where a downtown march is planned on Saturday. "I'm hoping that there is enough fire in people's hearts and minds to urge them to be mobilized."\par \par \uc2 But the chances that the federal government will step in this year with a comprehensive immigration reform bill seem slim.\par \par \uc2 President Barack Obama had once promised to tackle immigration reform in his first 100 days, but has pushed back that timetable several times. He said this week that Congress may lack the "appetite" to take on immigration after going through a tough legislative year.\par \par \uc2 However, the president and Congress could address related issues, like boosting personnel and resources for border security, in spending bills this year.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, activists say problems with a broken immigration system continue to affect millions -- raids on workplaces create mistrust of authorities and separate families with mixed immigration status, employers take advantage of immigrant labor and thousands of college students are left in limbo.\par \par \uc2 That includes 19-year-old Patricio Gonzalez, who immigrated to the U.S. from Argentina at age five with his family on a tourist visa. It expired and his family wasn't able to gain legal status. They stayed anyway.\par \par \uc2 The Memphis teen said he couldn't attend college because he couldn't afford tuition and wasn't eligible for most student aid.\par \par \uc2 "Do you know how difficult it is to see all your friends getting their education, and you've grown up with these people for years, they're part of your family?" he said. "We're creating lost generations -- kids who grow up hopeless with no sense of betterment."\par \par \uc2 Activists aren't alone in their opposition, a fact May 1 organizers hope will draw out even more people to rallies on Saturday.\par \par \uc2 California legislators have mulled canceling contracts with Arizona in protest. Denver Public Schools has banned work-related travel to Arizona. And several legal challenges, preventing the bill from going into effect this summer, are in the works.\par \par \uc2 Immigrant rights activists and politicians also say they're stepping up other forms of action. U.S. Rep. Luis Gutierrez, a Chicago Democrat who has sponsored a House immigration bill, said he plans to participate in civil disobedience at the White House on Saturday. In Chicago, several college students plan to publicly "come out" as illegal immigrants on a downtown stage.\par \par \uc2 "It's time to come together and show that undocumenteds have dignity. They're human," said Douglas Interiano, a spokesman of Reform Immigration for Texas Alliance, which is helping plan Saturday's march in Dallas.\par \par \uc2 He projected up to 100,000 could march in Texas with similar events planned in El Paso, Houston, Austin and San Juan. Organizers in California predicted up to 100,000 marching in downtown Los Angeles, too.\par \par \uc2 "Given what's happening in Arizona now it's crucial for us to speak out and denounce what's happening," said Veronica Mendez, an organizer with the Workers Interfaith Network in Minneapolis, where there's a Saturday rally. "We all have the same hopes and goals."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press Writers Steve Karnowski in Minneapolis and Travis Loller in Nashville, Tenn., contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100430e64u001rz\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

(AP) -- The son of a Democratic Tennessee lawmaker was convicted Friday on two charges in the hacking of Sarah Palin's e-mail account while she campaigned on the Republican presidential ticket in 2008.\par \par \uc2 The federal court jury reached its verdict against David Kernell, 22, after four days of deliberation. He was found guilty of obstruction of justice and unauthorized access to a computer, but was acquitted on a charge of wire fraud.\par \par \uc2 The jury deadlocked on a charge of identify theft. Prosecutors reserve the right to have a new trial on that charge. The charge of obstructing an investigation carries a maximum 20-year prison sentence and unauthorized access to a computer is a misdemeanor that carries a maximum one-year sentence.\par \par \uc2 Kernell's defense attorney maintained the hack amounted to college prank, not a crime. Kernell was a student at the University of Tennessee at the time. Prosecutors argued it was a more serious effort to damage Palin's political campaign.\par \par \uc2 Knoxville Assistant U.S. Attorney Greg Weddle, the chief prosecutor in the case, said they had not decided whether to try Kernell again on the identity theft charge.\par \par \uc2 Thomas van Flein, Sarah Palin's personal attorney, said he has been involved in the case from the morning they learned of the hacking in 2008.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 596 immigrants convicted of crimes nabbed in South\par \par \uc2 ATLANTA (AP) -- Federal agents arrested 596 immigrants with criminal records during a three-day immigration enforcement sweep across the Southeast, authorities announced Friday in what they described as their biggest operation yet.\par \par \uc2 The three-day sweep -- dubbed Operation Cross Check by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials -- was the largest the agency has ever conducted targeting foreign nationals convicted of crimes. The convicted criminals have already served their sentences and authorities will now work to deport them.\par \par \uc2 "As a result of the operation, communities around the Southeast are safer than they were before," said Felicia Skinner, an ICE field director.\par \par \uc2 The sting involved nearly 400 federal and local law enforcement officers who sought out convicted criminals in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Arkansas, Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee and Puerto Rico.\par \par \uc2 Authorities say they didn't single out a specific nationality -- those arrested came from at least 60 nations in Latin America, Asia, Europe, Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa.\par \par \uc2 The immigrants will likely face immediate deportation or an immigration hearing, although at least 12 of those arrested during the surge may also be charged by prosecutors because of prior immigration arrest records. Those offenders could face up to 20 years in prison if convicted of felony re-entry.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Activists hope Ariz. law opposition boosts rallies\par \par \uc2 CHICAGO (AP) -- Immigrant rights activists hope Arizona's controversial immigration law will spark scores of people to protest in rallies nationwide and add urgency to pleas for federal immigration reform.\par \par \uc2 Dozens of marches are planned for Saturday in cities across the country from Los Angeles to Dallas to New York.\par \par \uc2 "What happened in Arizona proves that racism and anti-immigrant hysteria across the country still exists.

(AP) -- Republican candidates in the 8th Congressional District made candid comments about gays during a recent Tea Party forum that included discussion about the military's "don't ask don't tell" policy.\par \par \uc2 Physicians Ron Kirkland of Jackson and George Flinn of Memphis were among the candidates Thursday night who talked largely about how they're against the Obama administration and its policies, according to The Jackson Sun.\par \par \uc2 The candidates criticized the administration for wanting to overturn the gay policy, which prevents gays from serving openly in the military. President Barack Obama has called on Congress to lift the ban, and military officials are examining how to do that.\par \par \uc2 The candidates said ending the policy is "political correctness" that adds an unnecessary stress on the military.\par \par \uc2 Kirkland, a Vietnam veteran, said of his time in the military: "I can tell you if there were any homosexuals in that group, they were taken care of in ways I can't describe to you."\par \par \uc2 Smith, who served in the first Iraqi war, added: "I definitely wouldn't want to share a shower with a homosexual. We took care of that kind of stuff, just like (Kirkland) said."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100430e64u000uv\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 CHICAGO (AP) - Immigrant rights activists chanting "Boycott Arizona" and "Reform, Not Racism" demonstrated Thursday outside Chicago's Wrigley Field as the Cubs opened a four-game series against the Arizona Diamondbacks.\par \par \uc2 Protesters are upset over Arizona's new immigration law that makes it a state crime to be in the U.S. illegally and lets police question anyone they suspect of being an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . Activists nationwide have called for a boycott of Arizona tourism and businesses, including its athletic teams.\par \par \uc2 "We are here today to send a clear message to the state of Arizona that we are going to boycott" until lawmakers repeal the immigration law and stop criminalizing immigrants, said Pastor Jose Landaverde of Our Lady of Guadalupe Anglican Church in Chicago, who was among the more than three dozen protesters outside Wrigley Field. A small plane carrying a banner criticizing the law also circled over Wrigley.\par \par \uc2 Protesters said they've faxed a letter to Cubs management asking that the team's spring training be moved out of Arizona. Cubs spokesman Peter Chase said the team was declining comment.\par \par \uc2 Immigration reform groups said they targeted the Diamondbacks, in part, because the team's owners have supported Republican politicians who backed the Arizona law. The team said in a statement that isn't the case.\par \par \uc2 "Although D-backs' Managing General Partner Ken Kendrick has donated to Republican political candidates in the past ... Kendrick personally opposes State Bill 1070," the team said. "The D-backs have never supported State Bill 1070 and have never taken political stances."\par \par \uc2 Diamondbacks players and coaches had little to say about the issue Thursday beyond a few wisecracks. Backup infielder Augie Ojeda, who was born in Los Angeles, joked about changing his last name to Jones.\par \par \uc2 "We're here to play baseball. I'm going to stay out of the political arena," said Arizona manager A.J. Hinch.\par \par \uc2 Most fans filing into the stadium Thursday seemed bewildered by the protest, and others said they opposed the mixing of sports and politics.\par \par \uc2 "I think it makes their cause look silly," Cubs fan Tom McGrath said. "Our economy is in a recession, boycotting states doesn't seem very good."\par \par \uc2 Protesters said they plan to return to Wrigley Field for the rest of the series.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100429e64t001v6\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

Amy Klobuchar is proposing legislation aimed at improving teen driver safety after a recent rash of accidents around Minnesota left 16 people dead.\par \par \uc2 The Minnesota Democrat plans to introduce a bill that would require all states to implement gradual drivers license programs that phase in full driving privileges over time. Every state has some version of gradual license programs, but the requirements vary.\par \par \uc2 Klobuchar's bill would enforce minimum requirements for all states. In Minnesota, it would bump up the age drivers could get their learners permit to 16 and non-restricted licenses to 18.\par \par \uc2 Seven of the dead in the recent crashes were teenagers.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 GOP candidate: Ariz. immigration law 'wonderful'\par \par \uc2 ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- One of Minnesota's leading GOP candidates for governor applauded Arizona's strict new law against illegal immigration on Wednesday, calling the crackdown "a wonderful first step."\par \par \uc2 State Rep. Tom Emmer said he supports Arizona's efforts to make immigrants prove their immigration status and require police to probe if they have "reasonable suspicion" a person is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . He made the comments in a debate with his chief rival, Rep. Marty Seifert, broadcast on Minnesota Public Radio.\par \par \uc2 "We have certain immigration laws in this country, and when you have laws and you have a civil society that is based on the rule of law, you enforce the law," Emmer said.\par \par \uc2 The immigration issue flared up two days before about 2,000 Republican activists meet to decide whether to endorse Seifert or Emmer. Both men have promised to drop out if they're not endorsed. The contest is expected to be close and the candidates have been searching for any edge they can find. Until now, immigration has not been a major issue in the governor's race.\par \par \uc2 Seifert didn't directly endorse Arizona's law but said that state is moving in the right direction.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Lynx welcome Whalen back to her Minnesota home\par \par \uc2 MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Lindsay Whalen is home again, and the Minnesota Lynx are giving her an eager welcome.\par \par \uc2 They've got a lot of work for her to do, too.\par \par \uc2 Whalen was formally introduced at a news conference on Wednesday at Target Center, where the Lynx are hoping fans will gather in greater numbers than ever in the team's unspectacular history to watch the smooth shooting and passing flair from this tough-minded former Gophers star.\par \par \uc2 "I'm just thrilled to be back," Whalen said. "It's just cool to see that people still are excited, and care."\par \par \uc2 The Lynx now have an All-Star player at every position, making this Whalen addition just as important to the roster as to the ticket office.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Ad campaign targets meth use in Indian Country\par \par \uc2 ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- Federal officials on Wednesday launched an advertising campaign aimed at curbing methamphetamine use in American Indian communities throughout New Mexico and in more than a dozen other states.\par \par \uc2 The three-month campaign expands on a series of radio ads and billboards that were tested in recent years in a handful of states. The new effort includes nearly $2 million worth of television and radio air time as well as print and billboard space.\par \par \uc2 "There are a lot of cool things about being native. Meth isn't one of them," says a voice at the end of one of the new commercials. Indian youth painting a mural, playing basketball and practicing kicks in karate class are used during the 30-second spot to send the message that meth destroys creativity and health.\par \par \uc2 Gil Kerlikowske, the director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, and other officials gathered in Albuquerque to unveil the campaign.\par \par \uc2 "We know that people fall through the cracks on the reservation and fall through the cracks in other places on tribal land. We have to work hard to change that," he said after citing what he called "troubling" data about meth use rates in tribal communities.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100429e64t0009j\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHOENIX (AP) - Many of the cars that once stopped in the \uc2 Home Depot\uc2  parking lot to pick up day laborers to hang drywall or do landscaping now just drive on by.\par \par \uc2 Arizona's sweeping immigration bill allows police to arrest \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  day laborers seeking work on the street or anyone trying to hire them. It won't take effect until summer but it is already having an effect on the state's underground economy.\par \par \uc2 "Nobody wants to pick us up," Julio Loyola Diaz says in Spanish as he and dozens of other men wait under the shade of palo verde trees and lean against a low brick wall outside the east Phoenix home improvement store.\par \par \uc2 Many day laborers like Diaz say they will leave Arizona because of the law, which also makes it a state crime to be in the U.S. illegally and directs police to question people about their immigration status if there is reason to suspect they are illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Supporters of the law hope it creates jobs for thousands of Americans.\par \par \uc2 "We want to drive day labor away," says Republican state Rep. John Kavanagh, one of the law's sponsors.\par \par \uc2 An estimated 100,000 illegal immigrants have left Arizona in the past two years as it cracked down on illegal immigration and its economy was especially hard hit by the Great Recession. A Department of Homeland Security report on illegal immigrants estimates Arizona's \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  population peaked in 2008 at 560,000, and a year later dipped to 460,000.\par \par \uc2 The law's supporters hope the departure of illegal immigrants will help dismantle part of the underground economy here and create jobs for thousands of legal residents in a state with a 9.6 percent unemployment rate.\par \par \uc2 Kavanagh says day labor is generally off the books, and that deprives the state of much-needed tax dollars. "We'll never eliminate it, just like laws against street prostitution," he says. "But we can greatly reduce the prevalence."\par \par \uc2 Day laborers do jobs including construction, landscaping and household work for cash paid under the table. Those jobs have been harder to find since the housing industry collapsed here several years ago.\par \par \uc2 Standing near potted trees and bushes for sale at a \uc2 Home Depot\uc2  in east Phoenix, Diaz, 35, says he may follow three families in his neighborhood who moved to New Mexico because of the law. He says a friend is finding plenty of work in Dallas.\par \par \uc2 Diaz says he has too much to lose by staying -- he's supporting a wife and infant son back home in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, across the border from El Paso, Texas.\par \par \uc2 "They depend on me to survive," he says. "I'm not going to wait for police to come and arrest me."\par \par \uc2 Jose Armenta, a 33-year-old \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Mexico's western coast, is already planning to move to Utah within the next 20 days because of a combination of the economy and the new law.\par \par \uc2 "A lot of people drive by," he says as he watched nearby cars speeding past, "and they yell, 'Hey, go back to Mexico!'"\par \par \uc2 Analysts say it's too soon to tell what lasting effects the law will have on the state's underground work force, which also includes baby sitters, maids and cooks.\par \par \uc2 A study of immigrants in Arizona published in 2008 found that non-citizens, mostly in the country illegally, held an estimated 280,000 full-time jobs. The study by researcher Judith Gans at the University of Arizona examined 2004 data, finding that they contributed about 8 percent of the state's economic output, or $29 billion.\par \par \uc2 Losing hundreds of thousands of unskilled laborers wouldn't hurt the state's economy in the short term, but it could limit the economy's ability to grow once it recovers, says Marshall Vest, director of the Economic and Business Research Center at the University of Arizona's Eller College of Management.\par \par \uc2 Legal workers who are willing to take any available job now will become more choosy if the unemployment rate falls back to low levels seen before the recession hit.\par \par \uc2 "That's really the question, as to whether the existing population is willing to work those (low-level) jobs," Vest says. "I think economics provides the answer. If job openings have no applicants, then businesses need to address that by raising the offered wage."\par \par \uc2 Some illegal immigrants, however, intended to stick around.\par \par \uc2 Natalia Garcia, 35, from Mexico City, says she and her husband -- a day laborer -- will stay so their daughters -- both born in the U.S. -- can get a good education and learn English. The couple have been living in Arizona illegally for the last 10 years.\par \par \uc2 "Mexico doesn't have a lot of opportunities," she says. "Here, we work honestly, and we have a better life."\par \par \uc2 Olga Sanchez, 32, from southern Mexico, lives in Phoenix illegally with her two brothers, who are 21 and 17. Although the youngest boy is in high school, all three work and send money back home to their parents.\par \par \uc2 "This law is very bad for us," says Sanchez, who gets about $250 a week cleaning three houses. "I'm afraid of what's going to happen."\par \par \uc2 She says the family is going to wait and see if the law takes effect and what the fallout will be before deciding whether to leave. The law is certain to be challenged in court; Phoenix, Tucson and Flagstaff already are considering lawsuits.\par \par \uc2 "All I ask from God is a miracle for us to stay here and work," she says.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writer Bob Christie contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100429e64t00053\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 MEXICO CITY (AP) - Amnesty International called the abuse of migrants in Mexico a major human rights crisis Wednesday, and accused some officials of turning a blind eye or even participating in the kidnapping, rape and murder of migrants.\par \par \uc2 The group's report comes at a sensitive time for Mexico, which is protesting the passage of a law in Arizona that criminalizes undocumented migrants.\par \par \uc2 The Interior Department acknowledged in a statement that the mainly Central American migrants who pass through Mexico on their way to the United States suffer abuses, but attributed the problem to criminal gangs branching out into kidnapping and extortion of migrants.\par \par \uc2 Rupert Knox, Amnesty's Mexico researcher, said in the report that the failure by authorities to tackle abuses against migrants has made their trip through Mexico one of the most dangerous in the world.\par \par \uc2 "Migrants in Mexico are facing a major human rights crisis leaving them with virtually no access to justice, fearing reprisals and deportation if they complain of abuses," Knox said.\par \par \uc2 Central American migrants are frequently pulled off trains, kidnapped en masse, held at gang hideouts and forced to call relatives in the U.S. to pay off the kidnappers. Such kidnappings affect thousands of migrants each year in Mexico, the report says.\par \par \uc2 Many are beaten, raped or killed in the process.\par \par \uc2 One of the main issues, Amnesty says, is that migrants fear they will be deported if they complain to Mexican authorities about abuses.\par \par \uc2 At present, Article 67 of Mexico's Population Law says, "Authorities, whether federal, state or municipal ... are required to demand that foreigners prove their legal presence in the country, before attending to any issues."\par \par \uc2 The Interior Department said the government has taken some steps to combat abuses and Mexico's legislature is working to repeal Article 67 "so that no one can deny or restrict foreigners' access to justice and human rights, whatever their migratory status."\par \par \uc2 The Amnesty report said one female migrant told researchers that Mexican federal police had forced her group off a train and stolen their belongings. Forced to walk, she said, she was subsequently attacked by a gang and raped.\par \par \uc2 The Interior Department said it shares Amnesty's concern, and called the report "a valuable contribution."\par \par \uc2 Mexico has long been offended by mistreatment of its own migrants in the United States.\par \par \uc2 The Arizona law -- slated to take effect in late July or early August -- makes it a state crime to be in the U.S. illegally and allows police to question anyone they suspect of being an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . Mexico has complained that the law would lend itself to racial profiling and discrimination.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100429e64t0000h\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHOENIX (AP) - Many of the cars that once stopped in the \uc2 Home Depot\uc2  parking lot to pick up day laborers to hang drywall or do landscaping now just drive on by.\par \par \uc2 Arizona's sweeping immigration bill allows police to arrest \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  day laborers seeking work on the street or anyone trying to hire them. It won't take effect until summer but it is already having an effect on the state's underground economy.\par \par \uc2 "Nobody wants to pick us up," Julio Loyola Diaz says in Spanish as he and dozens of other men wait under the shade of palo verde trees and lean against a low brick wall outside the east Phoenix home improvement store.\par \par \uc2 Many day laborers like Diaz say they will leave Arizona because of the law, which also makes it a crime to be in the U.S. illegally and directs police to question people about their immigration status if there is reason to suspect they are illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Supporters of the law hope it creates jobs for thousands of Americans.\par \par \uc2 "We want to drive day labor away," says Republican Rep. John Kavanagh, one of the law's sponsors.\par \par \uc2 An estimated 100,000 illegal immigrants have left Arizona in the past two years as it cracked down on illegal immigration and its economy was especially hard hit by the Great Recession. A Department of Homeland Security report on illegal immigrants estimates Arizona's \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  population peaked in 2008 at 560,000, and a year later dipped to 460,000.\par \par \uc2 The law's supporters hope the departure of illegal immigrants will help dismantle part of the underground economy here and create jobs for thousands of legal residents in a state with a 9.6 percent unemployment rate.\par \par \uc2 Kavanagh says day labor is generally off the books, and that deprives the state of much-needed tax dollars. "We'll never eliminate it, just like laws against street prostitution," he says. "But we can greatly reduce the prevalence."\par \par \uc2 Day laborers do jobs including construction, landscaping and household work for cash paid under the table. Those jobs have been harder to find since the housing industry collapsed here several years ago.\par \par \uc2 Standing near potted trees and bushes for sale at a \uc2 Home Depot\uc2  in east Phoenix, Diaz, 35, says he may follow three families in his neighborhood who moved to New Mexico because of the law. He says a friend is finding plenty of work in Dallas.\par \par \uc2 Diaz says he has too much to lose by staying -- he's supporting a wife and infant son back home in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, across the border from El Paso, Texas.\par \par \uc2 "They depend on me to survive," he says. "I'm not going to wait for police to come and arrest me."\par \par \uc2 Jose Armenta, a 33-year-old \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Mexico's western coast, is already planning to move to Utah within the next 20 days because of a combination of the economy and the new law.\par \par \uc2 "A lot of people drive by," he says as he watched nearby cars speeding past, "and they yell, 'Hey, go back to Mexico!'"\par \par \uc2 Analysts say it's too soon to tell what lasting effects the law will have on the state's underground work force, which also includes baby sitters, maids and cooks.\par \par \uc2 A study of immigrants in Arizona published in 2008 found that non-citizens, mostly in the country illegally, held an estimated 280,000 full-time jobs. The study by researcher Judith Gans at the University of Arizona examined 2004 data, finding that they contributed about 8 percent of the state's economic output, or $29 billion.\par \par \uc2 Losing hundreds of thousands of unskilled laborers wouldn't hurt the state's economy in the short term, but it could limit the economy's ability to grow once it recovers, says Marshall Vest, director of the Economic and Business Research Center at the University of Arizona's Eller College of Management.\par \par \uc2 Legal workers who are willing to take any available job now will become more choosy if the unemployment rate falls back to low levels seen before the recession hit.\par \par \uc2 "That's really the question, as to whether the existing population is willing to work those (low-level) jobs," Vest says. "I think economics provides the answer. If job openings have no applicants, then businesses need to address that by raising the offered wage."\par \par \uc2 Some illegal immigrants, however, intended to stick around.\par \par \uc2 Natalia Garcia, 35, from Mexico City, says she and her husband -- a day laborer -- will stay so their daughters -- both born in the U.S. -- can get a good education and learn English. The couple have been living in Arizona illegally for the last 10 years.\par \par \uc2 "Mexico doesn't have a lot of opportunities," she says. "Here, we work honestly, and we have a better life."\par \par \uc2 Olga Sanchez, 32, from southern Mexico, lives in Phoenix illegally with her two brothers, who are 21 and 17. While the youngest boy is in high school, all three work and send money back home to their parents.\par \par \uc2 "This law is very bad for us," says Sanchez, who gets about $250 a week cleaning three houses. "I'm afraid of what's going to happen."\par \par \uc2 She says the family is going to wait and see if the law takes effect and what the fallout will be before deciding whether to leave. The law is certain to be challenged in court; Phoenix, Tucson and Flagstaff already are considering lawsuits.\par \par \uc2 "All I ask from God is a miracle for us to stay here and work," she says.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writer Bob Christie contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100428e64s002k3\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

John Cornyn is proposing new border security legislation that would give local and state police access to about $300 million in federal grants.\par \par \uc2 Cornyn, a Texas Republican, told reporters Wednesday that his Southern Border Security Assistance Act would give law enforcement within 100 miles of the Mexican border a shot at millions for extra equipment, overtime and new hires.\par \par \uc2 The announcement of the fast-track legislation comes just days after Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer signed into law one the nation's strictest local immigration laws. That law makes it a state crime to be in the country illegally and requires police to question people about their immigration status if they suspect they are an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Cornyn insisted Wednesday this his bill, which would fast-track security money to local and state authorities, has been in the works for some time and was prompted by the federal government's failure to adequately secure the border.\par \par \uc2 "This is something that has been a long-standing problem," Cornyn said of security issues.\par \par \uc2 The senator also said he was working with the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Defense to get more equipment, including unmanned aerial vehicles, to federal agents on the border.\par \par \uc2 "We need to do everything in our capacity to bring security to our border," Cornyn said.\par \par \uc2 He said he has long supported comprehensive immigration reform but insisted that border security had to come first.\par \par \uc2 Three Democratic senators -- Harry Reid of Nevada, Charles Schumer of New York and Robert Menendez of New Jersey -- are developing an immigration proposal that would call for more federal agents and other border security measures to be implemented before illegal immigrants could gain legal status in the U.S.\par \par \uc2 The security goals "must be met before action can be taken to adjust the status of people already in the United States illegally," according to a copy of the draft legislation, obtained Wednesday by The Associated Press.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press Writer Suzanne Gamboa, in Washington, D.C., contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100428e64s0029f\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) - One of Minnesota's leading GOP candidates for governor applauded Arizona's strict new law against illegal immigration on Wednesday, calling the crackdown "a wonderful first step."\par \par \uc2 State Rep. Tom Emmer said he supports Arizona's efforts to make immigrants prove their immigration status and require police to probe if they have "reasonable suspicion" a person is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . He made the comments in a debate with his chief rival, Rep. Marty Seifert, broadcast on Minnesota Public Radio.\par \par \uc2 "We have certain immigration laws in this country, and when you have laws and you have a civil society that is based on the rule of law, you enforce the law," Emmer said.\par \par \uc2 The immigration issue flared up two days before about 2,000 Republican activists meet to decide whether to endorse Seifert or Emmer. Both men have promised to drop out if they're not endorsed. The contest is expected to be close and the candidates have been searching for any edge they can find. Until now, immigration has not been a major issue in the governor's race.\par \par \uc2 Seifert didn't directly endorse Arizona's law but said that state is moving in the right direction.\par \par \uc2 "In concept, I think that they're moving in the right direction of trying to get control of the situation, which is out of control," Seifert said of the Arizona law after the debate. "I think most people agree with that."\par \par \uc2 Later Wednesday, he unveiled a list of immigration positions that stopped short of Arizona-style measures. It said he would work to end local policies barring police from inquiring about immigration status, let local law enforcement get training to enforce immigration laws, work with federal authorities to deport illegal aliens who are caught and require government agencies to check the immigration status of welfare recipients.\par \par \uc2 Seifert said he modeled his proposal on laws in Oklahoma, which passed a tough immigration law in 2007, and other states.\par \par \uc2 Outgoing GOP Gov. Tim Pawlenty has pushed for tougher immigration laws with little success since 2006. Minnesota's Democratic-controlled Legislature has rejected proposals to require police to turn over illegal immigrants to federal authorities and other measures.\par \par \uc2 Both Emmer and Seifert said they would like to make driver's licenses and state identification cards display a person's citizenship status.\par \par \uc2 Emmer said he has tried for five years to pass bills that would require voters to show photo IDs before voting. One of the earlier versions would have made candidates for office provide proof of citizenship. Emmer also introduced a bill in 2006 that would have prevented pregnant illegal immigrants from getting subsidized health care for anything but labor and delivery.\par \par \uc2 Seifert sponsored legislation to block illegal immigrants from getting college aid. He said he also voted in a transportation committee against a bill that would have allowed illegal immigrants to get state driver's licenses and would veto such a bill if it came to his desk as governor.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100428e64s001w5\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

COOPER and AMANDA LEE MYERS   \par \uc2 Associated Press Writers\par \uc2 1,028 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 April 2010\par 01:12\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2010.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHOENIX (AP) - The frustration had been building for years in Arizona with every drug-related kidnapping, every home invasion, every "safe house" discovered crammed with illegal immigrants from Mexico.\par \par \uc2 The tensions finally spilled over this month with passage of America's toughest law against illegal immigration, a measure that has put Arizona at the center of the heated debate over how to deal with the millions of people who sneak into the U.S. every year.\par \par \uc2 A number of factors combined to produce the law: a heavily conservative Legislature, the ascent of a Republican governor, anger over the federal government's failure to secure the border, and growing anxiety over crime that reached a fever pitch last month with the slaying of an Arizona rancher, apparently by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "The public wants something done. They're tired of it," said state Sen. Russell Pearce, who sponsored the legislation. "They've seen the ineptness and the malfeasance on the part of the government, and they're frustrated."\par \par \uc2 The new law makes it a state crime to be in the U.S. illegally and directs police to question people about their immigration status if there is reason to suspect they are illegal.\par \par \uc2 Critics warned that the law could result in racial profiling and other abuses, and they are planning a legal challenge and a November referendum to overturn the measure. Supporters of the law say it is a commendable effort to combat what is fast becoming a scourge in the U.S.\par \par \uc2 Arizona is the biggest gateway into the U.S. for illegal immigrants. The state is home to an estimated 460,000 illegal immigrants -- a population larger than that of entire cities such as Cleveland, St. Louis and New Orleans.\par \par \uc2 The Republican-dominated Legislature has backed a series of tough immigration measures in the past decade, only to have the most aggressive efforts thwarted by then-Gov. Janet Napolitano, a Democrat.\par \par \uc2 But the political stars aligned this year for the Republicans. President Barack Obama appointed Napolitano to his Cabinet, clearing the way for Republican Secretary of State Jan Brewer to take over as governor. The Republicans made a headlong rush back into the immigration debate, and Brewer signed the bill last week.\par \par \uc2 The law reflects frustration with what many lawmakers see as inaction by the federal government.\par \par \uc2 "While the Bush administration dropped the ball on border security and illegal immigration, the Obama administration can't even find it," said Republican state Rep. John Kavanagh.\par \par \uc2 He said lawmakers also felt compelled to act because more immigrants will come to the U.S. as the economy improves and there is a "smell of amnesty in the air" under the Obama administration.\par \par \uc2 Over the past three years, Border Patrol agents have made 990,000 arrests of immigrants crossing the border illegally in Arizona, or an average of 900 a day. The figures represent 45 percent of all arrests of illegal immigrants along U.S. borders.\par \par \uc2 Authorities routinely come across safe houses and vehicles jammed with immigrants across the vast Arizona desert. Last week, 67 illegal immigrants were found crammed inside a U-Haul truck -- a fairly typical scenario in the state.\par \par \uc2 "We're on a hamster wheel here. We're chasing our tail until that border is secured," said Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu, whose territory includes busy smuggling corridors.\par \par \uc2 The volume of drugs coming through the Arizona border is also eye-popping. Federal agents seized 1.2 million pounds (540,000 kilograms) of marijuana last year in Arizona. That amounts to an average of 1.5 tons per day.\par \par \uc2 Pot busts have become so common that until recently federal prosecutors in Arizona generally declined to press charges against marijuana smugglers caught with less than 500 pounds (227 kilograms).\par \par \uc2 Phoenix has also been dubbed the kidnapping capital of the U.S. amid a surge of extortion-related abductions tied to drugs and human smuggling. The city has averaged about a kidnapping a day in recent years -- some resulting in torture and death. Victims' legs have been burned with irons, their arms have been tied to the ceiling, their fingers broken with bricks.\par \par \uc2 The anger over immigration-related violence reached a boiling point in late March when a popular cattle rancher named Rob Krentz was gunned down along with his dog on his property near the border. With authorities suspecting an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , politicians seized on the killing to argue that border security is dangerously weak.\par \par \uc2 "It's something that should have been taken care of for years. It's not something we can keep slacking on," said Thomas Fitch, whose neighborhood near the Arizona Cardinals stadium was the site of a raid last month that netted 11 illegal immigrants in a safe house. "At the rate we're going now, it's going to get a lot worse."\par \par \uc2 There has long been strong public support in Arizona for a crackdown.\par \par \uc2 In 2004, Arizona voters easily approved a law that denies some welfare benefits to illegal immigrants. It passed with 55 percent of the vote. In 2006, lawmakers put four immigration measures on the ballot, including ones that would deny other government benefits to illegal immigrants and make English the official language. Each measure passed with at least 70 percent.\par \par \uc2 At the same time, Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio carved out a reputation as a national leader on illegal immigration, routinely carrying out raids in Hispanic neighborhoods that have prompted a federal investigation. He was elected to a fifth term in 2008.\par \par \uc2 As the backlash grows over the law, people like Natalia Garcia are closely watching to see how it plays out. She and her husband are illegal immigrants and are afraid that they will get swept up.\par \par \uc2 "It's taking away our human rights because we have brown skin," she said in Spanish while shopping at a Phoenix grocery store, adding that they will move their family back to Mexico if arrested. "Although we'll live poor, it's better to be together."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press Writer Jacques Billeaud contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100428e64s000p6\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 MEXICO CITY (AP) - The Mexican government warned its citizens Tuesday to use extreme caution if visiting Arizona because of a tough new law that requires all immigrants and visitors to carry U.S.-issued documents or risk arrest.\par \par \uc2 President Barack Obama also criticized the law, saying it could lead to harassment of Hispanics, and he called for bipartisan support to fix America's broken immigration system. Two senior officials in his government said the Arizona law may face a legal challenge by federal authorities.\par \par \uc2 "Now suddenly if you don't have your papers, and you took your kid out to get ice cream, you're going to get harassed -- that's something that could potentially happen," the U.S. president said of the measure. "That's not the right way to go."\par \par \uc2 Arizona's law -- slated to take effect in late July or early August -- makes it a state crime to be in the U.S. illegally and allows police to question anyone they suspect of being an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . Lawmakers said the legislation, which has sparked huge protests and litigation, was needed because the Obama administration is failing to enforce existing federal laws.\par \par \uc2 Mexico's Foreign Ministry issued a travel alert for Arizona after the law was signed, warning that its passage shows "an adverse political atmosphere for migrant communities and for all Mexican visitors."\par \par \uc2 The alert said that once the law takes effect, foreigners can be questioned at any moment and detained if they fail to carry immigration documents. And it warns that the law will also make it illegal to hire or be hired from a vehicle stopped on the street.\par \par \uc2 A Mexican government-affiliated agency that supports Mexicans living and working in the United States called for boycotts of Tempe, Ariz.-based \uc2 US Airways\uc2 , the Arizona Diamondbacks and the Phoenix Suns until those organizations rebuke the law.\par \par \uc2 "We are making a strong call to the Arizona government to retract this regressive and racist law that's impacting not only residents of Arizona, but people in all 50 states and in Mexico as well," said Raul Murillo, who works with the Institute for Mexicans Abroad, an autonomous agency of Mexico's Foreign Ministry.\par \par \uc2 US Airways spokesman Jim Olson\uc2  said "we have had absolutely no customers who have canceled flights" as a result of the controversy. Calls to the Diamondbacks and the Suns were not immediately returned.\par \par \uc2 In Washington, Attorney General Eric Holder and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano criticized the law, with Holder saying the federal government may challenge it.\par \par \uc2 A number of options are under consideration, including "the possibility of a court challenge," Holder said.\par \par \uc2 A citizen effort to repeal the law also is expected. Jon Garrido, who produces a Hispanic website and ran unsuccessfully last year for the Phoenix City Council, said he plans to begin gathering signatures next week to get a repeal referendum on the November ballot. If successful, the effort would block the law from taking effect until the vote.\par \par \uc2 Obama said Tuesday that "poorly conceived" measures such as Arizona's can be halted if the federal government fixes the U.S. immigration system for good.\par \par \uc2 Obama pledged to bring his own party along, pleading with Republicans to join in as the only realistic hope to solve a politically volatile problem and get an immigration deal done.\par \par \uc2 "I will bring the majority of Democrats to the table in getting this done," Obama said in response to a question at a town hall in south-central Iowa. "But I've got to have some help from the other side."\par \par \uc2 U.S. politicians also weighed in on the growing controversy, with election season looming.\par \par \uc2 In California, Meg Whitman, the Republican front-runner in the California gubernatorial primary, said Arizona is taking the wrong approach.\par \par \uc2 "I think there's just better ways to solve this problem," Whitman said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press.\par \par \uc2 California state Sen. President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg said the law attempts to legalize racial profiling and called on Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger to review the state's contracts with Arizona and cancel them if legally possible.\par \par \uc2 Schwarzenegger has not yet replied, but told reporters that immigration matters are the responsibility of the federal government.\par \par \uc2 Arizona Sen. John McCain, seeking re-election, told CBS's "The Early Show" that his state needed such a law because the Obama administration has failed to secure the borders, resulting in drugs pouring into the southwestern United States from Mexico.\par \par \uc2 Each day, more than 65,000 Mexican residents are in Arizona to work, visit friends and relatives and shop, according to a University of Arizona study sponsored by the Arizona Office of Tourism. While there, the Mexican visitors spend more than $7.35 million daily in Arizona's stores, restaurants, hotels and other businesses, the researchers found.\par \par \uc2 Bimbo Bakeries\uc2 , one of many Mexican companies operating in Arizona, said Tuesday it doesn't expect Arizona's new immigration law to affect its employees.\par \par \uc2 "We carefully screen all associates to ensure they are authorized to work in the United States," Bimbo spokesman David Margulies said.\par \par \uc2 At the Mexico City airport Tuesday, Mexicans heading for the U.S. said they were very troubled by the new law.\par \par \uc2 "It's humiliating," said Modesto Perez, who lives in Illinois. "It's really ugly."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press Writer Jonathan Cooper in Phoenix contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100428e64s0006d\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 DENVER (AP) - Former Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge said Tuesday he's uncomfortable with Arizona's new immigration law, saying it allows police to question people without probable cause.\par \par \uc2 But he also faulted the Democratic and Republican parties for failing to come up with a national policy and opening the door for laws like Arizona's, which makes it a state crime to be in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 "A pox on both parties," Ridge, a Republican, said in an interview with The Associated Press.\par \par \uc2 He was in Denver for a discussion of terrorism at the Center for Empowered Living and Learning, which organizes educational events and maintains a permanent exhibit on terrorism.\par \par \uc2 The law, signed by Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer on Friday, takes effect this summer. It requires police to try to determine someone's immigration status if there is a "reasonable suspicion" that he or she is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Ridge said he hadn't read the law, but said "I'm uncomfortable with it from what I've seen and heard."\par \par \uc2 He singled out the lack of a tougher requirement for probable cause before police question someone's status.\par \par \uc2 Ridge was the first secretary of the Homeland Security Department, whose responsibilities include immigration.\par \par \uc2 Ridge was governor of Pennsylvania in 2003 when he was nominated by then-President George W. Bush to be the first Homeland Security secretary, whose repsonsibilities include immigration. He resigned in 2005.\par \par \uc2 Ridge said Congress should "legitimize" the status of the 12 million illegal immigrants in the country but not grant them citizenship.\par \par \uc2 "It's ridiculous to think ... we're going to identify 12 million to 14 million people and send them back," he said.\par \par \uc2 Ridge also advocated ID cards with biometric identifiers for immigrant workers and tough penalties for employers who hire illegal workers.\par \par \uc2 Once those measures were in place, the U.S. could push Mexico to help control immigration, he said.\par \par \uc2 But Ridge said the odds are against Congress passing such an overhaul.\par \par \uc2 "I'm not optimistic, and I feel bad about that," he said.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100428e64s00026\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

Senate leader wants to sever economic ties with Arizona, end contracts between states\b0\par\par\uc2 By CATHY BUSSEWITZ   \par \uc2 Associated Press Writer\par \uc2 426 \uc2 words\par \uc2 27 April 2010\par 22:29\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2010.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) - One of California's top legislative leaders called on Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger Tuesday to review the state's contracts with Arizona and cancel them if legally possible, as a protest against that state's new immigration law.\par \par \uc2 In a letter to the governor, state Sen. President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg said the recently signed law attempts to legalize racial profiling.\par \par \uc2 "I think we have a moral obligation to deliver an unequivocal message to lawmakers in Arizona that California does not condone its conduct," Steinberg wrote.\par \par \uc2 The law allows police officers to question anyone they suspect of being an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , and makes it a state crime to be in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 Steinberg asked Schwarzenegger to provide details about California's contracts with any business or government in Arizona. He wrote that he doubts that the state law is constitutional, but it could take years for courts to resolve that question.\par \par \uc2 Schwarzenegger has not yet replied but told reporters that immigration matters are the responsibility of the federal government.\par \par \uc2 "I urge the federal government to get their act together," the governor said in a news conference.\par \par \uc2 Schwarzenegger spokesman Aaron McLear added that the administration received the letter but does not yet have an opinion.\par \par \uc2 "We need to determine how this idea would affect our budget and job-creation efforts," McLear said in an e-mail. "The governor does not support the Arizona law, but the only real solution is for the federal government to produce a comprehensive immigration policy for the entire country."\par \par \uc2 California and Arizona have extensive interaction.\par \par \uc2 The state Department of General Services, the state's main procurement arm, identified 73 private companies based in Arizona to which California has awarded contracts. Those contracts were worth a combined $10.3 million in the past year and included computer manufacturers, human resources companies, a fertilizer maker, a publishing house, janitorial suppliers and others.\par \par \uc2 However, they do not represent all of California's contracts with Arizona, department spokesman Jeffrey Young said.\par \par \uc2 Some departments, such as the California Department of Transportation and the Department of Water Resources, can enter contracts without approval from the Department of General Services, he said.\par \par \uc2 The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation said Arizona houses 4,124 of the state's inmates in private prisons operated by \uc2 Corrections Corporation of America\uc2 . Because the company is based in Nashville, Tenn., it's unclear whether the inmates would be affected.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100428e64s0001j\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) - A Texas inmate was executed Tuesday evening for fatally stabbing an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  during an attempted robbery a dozen years ago.\par \par \uc2 Samuel Bustamante, 40, said nothing, shaking his head when asked by the warden if he wanted to make a final statement. He took several nearly inaudible breaths as the lethal drugs took effect, then slipped into unconsciousness as four female friends he invited to the death chamber watched.\par \par \uc2 Eight minutes later, at 6:22 p.m. CDT, he was pronounced dead, making him the seventh prisoner executed this year in the nation's most active death penalty state.\par \par \uc2 No friends or relatives of his victim were present.\par \par \uc2 Bustamante was convicted of the 1998 slaying of Rafael Alvarado, 27, a Mexican national in Fort Bend County, southwest of Houston, who became a target of what Bustamante and some of his friends called "shopping trips" where they would hunt illegal immigrants, then beat and rob them.\par \par \uc2 The punishment came about 90 minutes after the U.S. Supreme Court rejected a last-ditch appeal from Bustamante's attorneys. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, the state's highest criminal court, had refused a similar appeal Monday. The Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles also declined a clemency request.\par \par \uc2 In a taped confession to detectives, Bustamante said he and three friends -- Dedrick Depriest and brothers Walter and Arthur Escamilla, all from El Campo, about 70 miles southwest of Houston -- spent the day in January 1998 eating and drinking. He said they decided to go "shopping" in Rosenberg, 40 miles to the northeast, as bars were closing at 2 a.m.\par \par \uc2 Alvarado, after leaving a Rosenberg bar, approached the pickup driven by Arthur Escamilla and offered to pay for a ride home to nearby Richmond.\par \par \uc2 Alvarado joined Walter Escamilla and Bustamante in the bed of the truck and they drove off. After a few minutes, Bustamante told officers, he pulled a knife and began stabbing Alvarado as Escamilla held him down. Alvarado managed to break free and bail out of the speeding truck.\par \par \uc2 Police following a trail of blood the next morning found Alvarado's body in a ditch. He'd been stabbed at least 10 times.\par \par \uc2 Two months later, with Bustamante jailed on an unrelated charge in Wharton County, authorities notified Rosenberg police after receiving a tip he was involved in Alvarado's slaying.\par \par \uc2 "I don't need a judge and I don't need a jury to tell me I'm guilty," Bustamante, a former oil field worker, told detectives.\par \par \uc2 At least nine other condemned Texas prisoners have execution dates approaching soon.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100428e64s0000t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. April 23, 2010.\par \par \uc2 What a comedown sad days for a county judge\par \par \uc2 These are difficult days for Dave Bisbee, the Benton County judge and former state senator who is accused of committing five misdemeanors in his first term of office. They're not exactly great days for Benton County, either. It's a safe bet that, when he took his oath of office, the 63-year-old Mr. Bisbee never envisioned that his long years as a public servant would lead to such ugly headlines.\par \par \uc2 Judge Bisbee was arrested Wednesday on ethics-related charges connected with the way he awarded (or failed to properly award) competitive bids on three separate county projects. They involve: (1) His decision last December to hire his own company, Valley Homes, to perform county remodeling work; (2) the way in which he awarded bids for the clean-up of the debris left by the countywide ice-storm in January of 2009; and (3) his decision last June to throw out the bids for work on a health department office in Siloam Springs.\par \par \uc2 If the humiliation of this high-profile arrest weren't enough, Van Stone, the prosecutor in Benton County, says he's preparing to ask that the county judge be removed from office.\par \par \uc2 Judge Bisbee called a news conference to say he wouldn't resign and will continue his bid for a second term. But a conviction on any of these specific statutes would force him out of office, according to Mr. Stone. His arraignment is set for June 7th in the courtroom of Circuit Judge Robin Green, although the prosecutor says he will ask that the date be moved up if possible. For the moment, the county judge still faces three Republican opponents in the primary come May 18th.\par \par \uc2 The Hon. Dave Bisbee is now accused of violating five separate laws, which involve either using undue influence for gain or privileges; failing to follow bidding requirements; or being an interested party to a county contract. ...\par \par \uc2 After turning himself in at the sheriff's office, the county judge headed home with nothing to say. Calls from the media went unanswered. He did tell one reporter over the phone that he had no statement before hanging up.\par \par \uc2 It is Dave Bisbee's every right not to answer questions, but his declining to comment on charges that have captured the attention of people in Benton County and beyond is still a disappointment. His constituents deserve something more than No Comment.\par \par \uc2 Dave Bisbee's biggest threat has never come from Prosecutor Stone or from political rivals. He's been a victim of his own bad decisions. And arrogance. Pride still goeth before the usual fall.\par \par \uc2 Throughout the scandals that have enveloped his office, Tabatha Hunter of the Benton County Daily Record has regularly turned the spotlight on the county judge's dubious decisions, which led to two state investigations and now to these formal charges being filed. One consolation in the midst of all this scandalous news is that conscientious journalists can still play a valuable role as public watchdogs.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 The Jonesboro Sun. April 23, 2010.\par \par \uc2 Corruption hurts border security\par \par \uc2 Saying the United States should close off its borders and stop illegal immigrants and illicit drugs is easy for our political leaders and would-be political leaders. Making it happen has proven quite difficult and frustrating. ...\par \par \uc2 If our only challenge was stopping illegal immigration, we might be able to deal with the problem more effectively. But we are also battling Mexican drug cartels that are smuggling billions and billions of dollars' worth of illegal drugs into the country. They can afford to carry the battle to us. ...\par \par \uc2 Pryor said he is particularly concerned about problems within the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), which is growing fast as we try to get more agents into border protection. Along with growth, though, comes the potential for more corruption. In 2009 there were 576 allegations of corruption in the CBP, 164 in Immigration and Customs Enforcement, 64 in the U.S. Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services and 25 in the Transportation Security Administration.\par \par \uc2 During a hearing in March Pryor voiced concern that the CBP is not adequately screening job applicants. One internal affairs witness testified that only about 15 percent of applicants receive a polygraph test during the hiring process but that 60 percent of those are found to be unsuitable. That could mean about half of the others may also be unsuitable, but they evade detection. CBP employees are required to undergo a background check every five years, but the process is currently backlogged by 10,000 cases.\par \par \uc2 Other witnesses cited cases of corruption, including one border inspector who pleaded guilty to smuggling more than 1,000 kilograms of marijuana in the United States and receiving more than $5 million in bribe payments. Quite a salary supplement, huh? Two CBP agents were caught in Brownsville, Texas, assisting an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  and narcotics smuggling organization. A TSA supervisor was accused of participating in the smuggling of narcotics through a checkpoint at a major U.S. airport.\par \par \uc2 As a result of the hearing and other information he gathered, Pryor this week introduced legislation aimed at preventing corruption of border agents. The proposed bill would require a more vigorous hiring process and regular background checks. Of course, that's going to take more money.\par \par \uc2 Pryor also joined with several other senators in sending a letter to Janet Napolitano, secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, demanding immediate action to address the problem.\par \par \uc2 "My message to DHS is clear: Either fix your problems voluntarily, or I will make sure you do it by law," Pryor said. "The stakes are too high to let these problems mount. Drugs smuggled in today could be dirty bombs tomorrow. I refuse to wait for a tragedy to strike before we take action."\par \par \uc2 Surely, that's a message that can gain bipartisan support.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Harrison Daily Times. April 21, 2010.\par \par \uc2 Feel the wind generate the power\par \par \uc2 Jeopardy! fans know that the show's format consists of Alex Trebek reading the answers and the contestants having to supply the questions.\par \par \uc2 Today's category is pop songs and energy concerns. "The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind. The answer is blowing in the wind."\par \par \uc2 The question is, "Where can we find an alternative source of power, one that occurs naturally, one that does not cause pollution, does not consume non-renewable resources like coal or petroleum, one that will help the United States reduce its dependence on foreign sources of energy?\par \par \uc2 Yes, the answer to some of our energy concerns is blowing in the wind and it's the wind in the hills southwest of Marshall in Searcy County.\par \par \uc2 A Lenexa, Kan., company, TradeWind Energy, has proposed building a windfarm to be called the Star Mountain Wind Project. About 100 towers could dot the landscape, cranking out electricity with the help of the wind.\par \par \uc2 The energy situation in this country is no game show, where the losing contestants get a lovely parting gift of higher costs, tighter supplies and increased international tensions over oil.\par \par \uc2 We need to find ways of finding cheaper, more efficient means of supplying our country's ever expanding energy demands. Wind power could be one of those means, and we're happy that TradeWind Energy has chosen Searcy County as the location for one of their wind farms.\par \par \uc2 TradeWind Energy said they study an area thoroughly before they make a selection, so the decision to build in Searcy County did not come lightly.\par \par \uc2 Sure, wind power is not perfect. There are many disadvantages, as its opponents will point out. There's the noise, the threat to wildlife, the claim that wind power is not very efficient and, of course, there's the contention that all those whirling turbines will spoil the breathtaking Ozark scenery.\par \par \uc2 However, we think the advantages will outweigh the disadvantages. With improvements in technology going on constantly, wind power can only get better.\par \par \uc2 And the distressed Searcy County economy, which has been like "Dust in the Wind," will benefit greatly from jobs and sales connected with the project.\par \par \uc2 Next question. "Everyone knows it's windy."\par \par \uc2 Answer is, "What do all those workers, suppliers and consumers connected with the Star Mountain Wind Project hope to say about the area?"\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Texarkana Gazette. April 24, 2010.\par \par \uc2 Derivative Dangers\par \par \uc2 The Senate Agriculture Committee on Wednesday voted 13-8 in favor of new rules restricting commercial banks from trading in derivatives.\par \par \uc2 The legislation was introduced by U.S. Sen. Blanche Lincoln, D-Ark., the committee's chairman, and approved by all the panel's 12 Democrats and one of the nine Republican members. The rules will likely be included in a broader financial regulation bill that the Senate could start debating next week.\par \par \uc2 The main thrust of the legislation is to restrict banks that receive federal guarantees such as deposit insurance from the \uc2 Federal Deposit Insurance Corp\uc2 . From trading in the exotic and often risky financial instruments.\par \par \uc2 Derivatives are, in their most basic form, a bet on the price of some other security or commodity. An option on a stock or a futures contract on the price of oil or corn or some other commodity are the most easily understandable examples. There are also a wide array of exotic derivatives that banks, institutional and private investors and speculators use to increase leverage, ensure against a loss in an underlying investment, reduce risk of loss or simply broaden investment options.\par \par \uc2 Wall Street banks can even tailor derivatives to the needs of individual clients. And all that's fine. When they use their own money.\par \par \uc2 And that's what this legislation proposes. Banks would have to spin off their derivatives trading operations into separate firms.\par \par \uc2 These separate firms would have their own capital base, but could not leverage the capital of their much larger parent firms.\par \par \uc2 The idea is to eliminate the "too big to fail" scenario. If these smaller firms go under, then let them fall.\par \par \uc2 Naturally, large banks such as \uc2 J.P. Morgan\uc2 /Chase and \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2  oppose the bill.\par \par \uc2 They make a lot of money from derivatives, and the larger the capital base they can leverage, the better. And because these financial behemoths have a lot of power in Washington, they may succeed in getting the provision nixed from the final overhaul bill.\par \par \uc2 But we think it's a good idea. If the banks want to play in the derivatives casino, fine. But they shouldn't be able to call on federal funds when their bets go south.\par \par \uc2 We've already been down that road. We don't want to see it happen again.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100427e64r002v4\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

COOPER and AMANDA LEE MYERS   \par \uc2 Associated Press Writers\par \uc2 1,030 \uc2 words\par \uc2 27 April 2010\par 19:33\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2010.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHOENIX (AP) - The frustration had been building for years in Arizona with every drug-related kidnapping, every home invasion, every "safe house" discovered crammed with illegal immigrants from Mexico.\par \par \uc2 The tensions finally spilled over this month with passage of the nation's toughest law against illegal immigration, a measure that has put Arizona at the center of the heated debate over how to deal with the millions of people who sneak into the U.S. every year.\par \par \uc2 A number of factors combined to produce the law: a heavily conservative Legislature, the ascent of a Republican governor, anger over the federal government's failure to secure the border, and growing anxiety over crime that reached a fever pitch last month with the slaying of an Arizona rancher, apparently by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "The public wants something done. They're tired of it," said state Sen. Russell Pearce, who sponsored the legislation. "They've seen the ineptness and the malfeasance on the part of the government, and they're frustrated."\par \par \uc2 The new law makes it a state crime to be in the U.S. illegally and directs police to question people about their immigration status if there is reason to suspect they are illegal.\par \par \uc2 Critics warned that the law could result in racial profiling and other abuses, and they are planning a legal challenge and a November referendum to overturn the measure. Supporters of the law say it is a commendable effort to combat what is fast becoming a scourge in the U.S.\par \par \uc2 Arizona is the biggest gateway into the U.S. for illegal immigrants. The state is home to an estimated 460,000 illegal immigrants -- a population larger than that of entire cities such as Cleveland, St. Louis and New Orleans.\par \par \uc2 The Republican-dominated Legislature has backed a series of tough immigration measures in the past decade, only to have the most aggressive efforts thwarted by then-Gov. Janet Napolitano, a Democrat.\par \par \uc2 But the political stars aligned this year for the GOP. President Barack Obama appointed Napolitano to his Cabinet, clearing the way for Republican Secretary of State Jan Brewer to take over as governor. The GOP made a headlong rush back into the immigration debate, and Brewer signed the bill last week.\par \par \uc2 The law reflects frustration with what many lawmakers see as inaction by the federal government.\par \par \uc2 "While the Bush administration dropped the ball on border security and illegal immigration, the Obama administration can't even find it," said GOP state Rep. John Kavanagh.\par \par \uc2 He said lawmakers also felt compelled to act because more immigrants will come to the U.S. as the economy improves and there is a "smell of amnesty in the air" under the Obama administration.\par \par \uc2 Over the past three years, Border Patrol agents have made 990,000 arrests of immigrants crossing the border illegally in Arizona, or an average of 900 a day. The figures represent 45 percent of all arrests of illegal immigrants along U.S. borders.\par \par \uc2 Authorities routinely come across safe houses and vehicles jammed with immigrants across the vast Arizona desert. Last week, 67 illegal immigrants were found crammed inside a U-Haul truck -- a fairly typical scenario in the state.\par \par \uc2 "We're on a hamster wheel here. We're chasing our tail until that border is secured," said Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu, whose territory includes busy smuggling corridors.\par \par \uc2 The volume of drugs coming through the Arizona border is also eye-popping. Federal agents seized 1.2 million pounds of marijuana last year in Arizona. That amounts to an average of 1.5 tons per day.\par \par \uc2 Pot busts have become so common that until recently federal prosecutors in Arizona generally declined to press charges against marijuana smugglers caught with less than 500 pounds.\par \par \uc2 Phoenix has also been dubbed the kidnapping capital of the U.S. amid a surge of extortion-related abductions tied to drugs and human smuggling. The city has averaged about a kidnapping a day in recent years -- some resulting in torture and death. Victims' legs have been burned with irons, their arms have been tied to the ceiling, their fingers broken with bricks.\par \par \uc2 The anger over immigration-related violence reached a boiling point in late March when a popular cattle rancher named Rob Krentz was gunned down along with his dog on his property near the border. With authorities suspecting an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , politicians seized on the killing to argue that border security is dangerously weak.\par \par \uc2 "It's something that should have been taken care of for years. It's not something we can keep slacking on," said Thomas Fitch, whose neighborhood near the Arizona Cardinals stadium was the site of a raid last month that netted 11 illegal immigrants in a safe house. "At the rate we're going now, it's going to get a lot worse."\par \par \uc2 There has long been strong public support in Arizona for a crackdown.\par \par \uc2 In 2004, Arizona voters easily approved a law that denies some welfare benefits to illegal immigrants. It passed with 55 percent of the vote. In 2006, lawmakers put four immigration measures on the ballot, including ones that would deny other government benefits to illegal immigrants and make English the official language. Each measure passed with at least 70 percent.\par \par \uc2 At the same time, Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio carved out a reputation as a national leader on illegal immigration, routinely carrying out raids in Hispanic neighborhoods that have prompted a federal investigation. He was elected to a fifth term in 2008.\par \par \uc2 As the backlash grows over the law, people like Natalia Garcia are closely watching to see how it plays out. She and her husband are illegal immigrants and are afraid that they will get swept up.\par \par \uc2 "It's taking away our human rights because we have brown skin," she said in Spanish while shopping at a Phoenix grocery store, adding that they will move their family back to Mexico if arrested.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHOENIX (AP) - A drug trafficking ring that used truck-mounted ramps to get smuggling vehicles over border fences, sophisticated counter-surveillance to avoid detection and hidden compartments in vehicles to bring at least 40,000 pounds of marijuana into the southern Arizona has been broken up, authorities said Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 The three-year investigation by federal, state and local law enforcement into the Mexican ring led to 26 suspects indicted on federal charges and 13 on state charges, said Dennis Burke, the U.S. Attorney for Arizona.\par \par \uc2 Among those arrested was an employee of the prosecutor's office in Cochise County, Ariz., who allegedly took money to feed confidential information to the ring.\par \par \uc2 The smuggling organization was likely connected to the Sinaloa Drug Cartel, Burke said. The investigation was dubbed "Operation Vaqueros" because of the cowboy attire worn the smugglers. Such clothing is typical of the Sinaloa cartel's members.\par \par \uc2 "They figured out several ways to breach the border fence," Burke said. "They were also smuggling marijuana via backpackers, so if they needed to hop (the fence) in certain places they would. They were using stolen vehicles, they were using ... ramping trucks. Their only limitation was their own creativity."\par \par \uc2 Twelve people identified as key players in the ring were indicted on charges of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute more than 1,000 kilograms of marijuana, a charge which carries a potential life sentence. Six of those suspects are still at large and believed to be in Mexico. The others indicted were lesser figures, typically drivers.\par \par \uc2 Federal agents obtained warrants to conduct seven wiretaps, which led to the arrest of the Cochise County Attorney's Office employee.\par \par \uc2 County Attorney Ed Rheinheimer said he was contacted by the DEA about 18 months ago telling him they had a wiretap showing a secretary in his office passing information to drug smugglers in the northern Mexican state of Sonora. The employee was a longtime resident of Naco, Ariz., who had been with the county for only a short time. He said the secretary was passing information about drug smuggling cases. She was allowed to keep working until her arrest in January as the investigation progressed.\par \par \uc2 Keeping employees from being corrupted by smugglers is a major worry, Rheinheimer said.\par \par \uc2 "It's a concern within the police departments, it's a concern among the municipalities, at the county level, at the state and at the federal, because the financial stakes are so high in both the drug smuggling trade and the people smuggling trade that the temptations can be overwhelming," Rheinheimer said. "We know that occasionally someone will succumb to the temptation."\par \par \uc2 Most of the pot was brought into Cochise County, which is a hub for drug and human smuggling. The slaying of a local rancher in March, possibly by a drug smuggler or an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , brought nationwide attention to the area and helped spur the passage of a tough new Arizona law cracking down on illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 The investigation began in 2007 after U.S. Border Patrol agents became aware of the sophisticated smuggling efforts employed by the ring in southeastern Arizona's Cochise County, which has a long border with Mexico. Eventually, the investigation also involved officers from the DEA, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, FBI, Arizona Department of Public Safety, Cochise County Sheriff and local police in Bisbee, Douglas, and Sierra Vista.\par \par \uc2 Such coordinated efforts are critical because it allows more officers to be brought to bear on large, sophisticated smuggling rings, Burke said.\par \par \uc2 "It took us time to break down all their tactics and strategies, their techniques," Burke said. "And it's going to have a ripple effect on other drug trafficking organizations, because now they know we've figured out many of their methods."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100427e64r0025i\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - A San Francisco lawmaker who came to the United States as an undocumented teenager plans to introduce legislation Tuesday calling for a citywide economic boycott of Arizona to protest the state's strict new immigration law.\par \par \uc2 "We are not going to use our city resources to support that law," said Supervisor David Campos, who is himself an immigrant from Guatemala and became a U.S. citizen in 1997.\par \par \uc2 Arizona's new legislation, signed into law Friday, makes being in the country illegally a crime punishable by up to six months in jail and a $2,500 fine.\par \par \uc2 City Attorney Dennis Herrera said Monday that his office already has started investigating if any contracts between San Francisco and Arizona could be severed without penalty. It is unclear how many businesses that could affect.\par \par \uc2 Herrera compared San Francisco's opposition to the measure to its stance against apartheid in South Africa, the oppression of Catholics in Northern Ireland, and discrimination against the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community.\par \par \uc2 "San Francisco has always taken a leadership role in issues of moral importance," Herrera said.\par \par \uc2 This tactic has been used against Arizona before with success, he said.\par \par \uc2 Arizona was one of the last states to adopt a holiday honoring Martin Luther King -- a reluctance that led to a boycott in the 1980s that cost the city hundreds of conventions and Super Bowl XXVII in 1993. The pressure, and the financial pinch, led the state to put the holiday on the ballot. Voters approved the measure, making Martin Luther King Day a holiday.\par \par \uc2 Steps like the one proposed by San Francisco would remind the state's lawmakers their decision could have economic and political consequences, Herrera said.\par \par \uc2 Campos said he also plans to sponsor a resolution calling on the federal government to stop auditing San Francisco businesses for \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  workers.\par \par \uc2 Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon, who has opposed the Arizona law, asked San Francisco supervisors to wait before taking such drastic steps.\par \par \uc2 "Calling for a boycott now would hurt immigrants and residents who depend on the revenue for their own employment," said Gordon. "We are fighting it in court and are confident it will never be implemented."\par \par \uc2 U.S. Rep. Raul Grijalva, a Tucson Democrat, has called for a boycott of convention business for the state and other calls have come for a boycott of Arizona goods, services and tourism because of the immigration law.\par \par \uc2 The measure -- set to take effect in late July or early August -- would make it a crime under state law to be in the U.S. illegally. It directs state and local police to question people about their immigration status if there is reason to suspect they are undocumented.\par \par \uc2 Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer, who signed the law last week, on Monday dismissed the economic boycott threats.\par \par \uc2 Appearing at an Arizona Town Hall in Tucson, Brewer said she doesn't believe the law is "going to have the kind of economic impact that some people think it might."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 AP videographer Haven Daley contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100427e64r001ho\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) - Condemned Texas inmate Samuel Bustamante was executed Tuesday evening for fatally stabbing an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Mexico during an attempted robbery a dozen years ago.\par \par \uc2 Bustamante, 40, said nothing, shaking his head when asked by the warden if wanted to make a final statement. He took several nearly inaudible breaths as the lethal drugs took effect, then slipped into unconsciousness as four female friends he invited to the death chamber watched.\par \par \uc2 Eight minutes later, at 6:22 p.m. CDT, he was pronounced dead, making him the seventh prisoner executed this year in the nation's most active death penalty state.\par \par \uc2 No friends or relatives of his victim were present.\par \par \uc2 Bustamante was convicted of the 1998 slaying of Rafael Alvarado, 27, a Mexican national in Fort Bend County, southwest of Houston, who became a target on what Bustamante and some of his friends called "shopping trips" where they would hunt illegal immigrants, then beat and rob them.\par \par \uc2 The punishment came about 90 minutes after the U.S. Supreme Court rejected a last-ditch appeal from Bustamante's attorneys. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, the state's highest criminal court, had refused a similar appeal Monday. The Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles also declined a clemency request.\par \par \uc2 In their appeal, attorneys said Bustamante "clearly suffers from mental retardation" and should be spared under a Supreme Court ruling that bars execution of the mentally impaired. They also argued that earlier appeals lawyers were unconstitutionally deficient in not raising the claim.\par \par \uc2 State attorneys disputed the arguments, saying the evidence didn't support the claims and there was no legal reason to delay the punishment.\par \par \uc2 "We are all human, and make mistakes, yet do we not deserve the benefit of the doubt?" Bustamante, who declined to speak with reporters, said on a website where prisoners seek pen pals.\par \par \uc2 Fred Felcman, a Fort Bend County assistant district attorney who was the lead prosecutor at Bustamante's trial in 2001, said the condemned killer's sentiment was "a classic thing."\par \par \uc2 "I'm thinking: 'You killed who you wanted to kill,'" he said. "There's no mistake here."\par \par \uc2 In a taped confession to detectives, Bustamante said he and three friends -- Dedrick Depriest and brothers Walter and Arthur Escamilla, all from El Campo -- spent the day in January 1998 eating and drinking and then decided to go "shopping" in Rosenberg, 40 miles to the northeast, as bars were closing at 2 a.m. Alvarado, after leaving a Rosenberg bar, approached the pickup driven by Arthur Escamilla and offered to pay for a ride home to nearby Richmond.\par \par \uc2 Alvarado joined Walter Escamilla and Bustamante in the bed of the truck and they drove off. After a few minutes, Bustamante told officers, he pulled a knife and began stabbing Alvarado as Escamilla held him down. Alvarado managed to break free and bail out of the speeding truck. Bustamante ordered the truck stopped so he could steal Alvarado's boots, but they couldn't find the victim in the dark.\par \par \uc2 Police following a trail of blood the next morning found Alvarado's body in a ditch. He'd been stabbed at least 10 times.\par \par \uc2 Two months later, with Bustamante jailed on an unrelated charge in Wharton County, authorities notified Rosenberg police after receiving a tip he was involved in Alvarado's slaying.\par \par \uc2 "I don't need a judge and I don't need a jury to tell me I'm guilty," Bustamante, a former oil field worker, told detectives.\par \par \uc2 Sid Crowley, one of his trial lawyers, said there never was a question about his guilt.\par \par \uc2 "He confessed to it," Crowley said.\par \par \uc2 Felcman said he remembered Bustamante telling authorities how his brother would use a baseball bat to beat victims but that he was "the one who stabs the guy."\par \par \uc2 "Bustamante liked killing," Felcman said. "He enjoyed it. He bragged about it ... He meets all the qualifications of a classic serial killer."\par \par \uc2 At the time of his arrest for Alvarado's murder, Bustamante and his brother, Bill, were charged with the beating and stabbing death of Lloyd Harold Turner, a 63-year-old man who lived under a highway overpass near El Campo. Bill Bustamante told authorities of other "shopping trips" and took a 40-year prison term in a plea deal in the Turner case.\par \par \uc2 Depriest and the Escamilla brothers each received eight-year prison terms for aggravated robbery related to Alvarado's death.\par \par \uc2 At least nine other condemned Texas prisoners have execution dates approaching soon.\par \par \uc2 Up next is Kevin Varga, 41, a Michigan native and South Dakota ex-con set to die May 12 for fatally beating a North Carolina man with a hammer and tree limb. One of his accomplices, Billy Galloway, 41, is scheduled to die the following day.\par \par \uc2 5\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100427e64r001ce\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

Day laborers can be arrested for soliciting work if they are in the U.S. illegally, and police departments can be sued if they don't carry out the law.\par \par \uc2 The chief of the Organization of American States also criticized the legislation.\par \par \uc2 "We consider the bill clearly discriminatory against immigrants, and especially against immigrants from Latin America," Jose Miguel Insulza said during a visit to El Salvador.\par \par \uc2 Calderon said trade and political ties with Arizona will be "seriously affected," although he announced no concrete measures.\par \par \uc2 Mexican politicians, church leaders and others have criticized Calderon for not taking a tougher stance against the law.\par \par \uc2 Some Mexican legislators have urged a trade boycott against Arizona, and several called the federal government's response lukewarm.\par \par \uc2 "In Congress, we support any trade and transport boycott necessary to reverse this law," said Oscar Martin Arce, a lawmaker from the president's National Action Party.\par \par \uc2 Mexico is Arizona's largest foreign market. The U.S. state sent $4.5 billion in exports to Mexico in 2009 -- nearly a third of its total exports, according to the U.S. International Trade Administration.\par \par \uc2 Andres Ibarra, president of the chamber of commerce in Nogales, a Mexican city across the border from Nogales, Arizona, said he doubted the government would impose a formal trade boycott, saying it would hurt Mexico most.\par \par \uc2 Even so, he warned the immigration law would harm Arizona economically. Ibarra said the U.S. state depends heavily on cheap labor from Mexican immigrants and any surge in deportations would make the state less competitive.\par \par \uc2 Arizona is home to an estimated 460,000 illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 "It's regrettable. I think this was a hasty decision that did not consider the consequences, not only for Mexicans and undocumented people from other countries, but also for the Arizona economy," Ibarra said. "Immigrants, as everyone knows, do the work that Americans don't want to do.\par \par \uc2 "This campaign is completely based on racism. It's a xenophobic campaign," he added.\par \par \uc2 Calderon said he would raise his concerns with President Barack Obama and U.S. lawmakers during a visit to Washington in May.\par \par \uc2 Obama has called the Arizona law misguided and instructed the U.S. Justice Department to examine it to see if it's legal.\par \par \uc2 Supporters of the law say it is necessary to protect Arizonans from a litany of crimes that they contend are committed by illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 The law comes as relations between Mexico and the U.S. had been steadily warming.\par \par \uc2 Washington is a strong supporter of Calderon's military-led offensive against drug cartels, providing training and equipment under the $1.3 billion Merida Initiative. The Obama administration has earned praise from Mexico for repeatedly acknowledging that U.S. drug consumption is a large part of the problem.\par \par \uc2 Two weeks ago, Michelle Obama chose Haiti and Mexico for her first solo trip abroad as U.S. first lady. She nurtured a friendship with Mexican first lady Margarita Zavala, a vocal advocate for thousands of Mexican children who immigrate alone to the U.S. in search of their parents and are often deported unaccompanied.\par \par \uc2 The cooperation in the drug war had largely overshadowed lingering tensions between the two countries over immigration.\par \par \uc2 The Calderon government expressed disappointment when U.S. lawmakers failed to agree in 2007 on an overhaul to the U.S. immigration system.\par \par \uc2 The Obama administration has promised to make immigration reform a priority, but the issue has taken a back seat amid the U.S. economic crisis.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press Writer E.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) - For Samuel Bustamante and his buddies, shopping did not mean a trip to the mall. It meant hunting illegal immigrants, then beating and robbing them.\par \par \uc2 Bustamante, 40, was set to be executed Tuesday for one such "shopping trip" 12 years ago that left 27-year-old Rafael Alvarado dead of stab wounds in Fort Bend County, southwest of Houston.\par \par \uc2 "I did do wrong, yet there is a lot more good in me than bad," Bustamante, who declined to speak with reporters, said on a website where death row inmates seek pen pals. "My wish is to show and prove that not everyone on death row is a bad person. Punish me yes, yet killing me is not the answer."\par \par \uc2 Bustamante's lawyers lost an appeal Monday at the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, the state's highest criminal court, and took their effort to stop the execution to the U.S. Supreme Court. Attorneys contended Bustamante should be spared because his school records show he is mildly mentally impaired. The Supreme Court has barred the execution of mentally impaired people.\par \par \uc2 In a taped confession to detectives, Bustamante said he and three friends -- Dedrick Depriest and brothers Walter and Arthur Escamilla, all from El Campo -- spent the day in January 1998 eating and drinking and then decided to go "shopping" in Rosenberg, 40 miles to the northeast, to pick up an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  about 2 a.m. as bars were closing. Alvarado emerged from a Rosenberg bar, approached the pickup driven by Arthur Escamilla and offered to pay for a ride home to nearby Richmond.\par \par \uc2 Alvarado joined Walter Escamilla and Bustamante in the bed of the truck and they drove off. After a few minutes and along a deserted Fort Bend County road, Bustamante told officers that he pulled a knife and began stabbing Alvarado as Escamilla held him down. Alvarado managed to break free and bail out of the speeding truck into the nighttime darkness.\par \par \uc2 Bustamante ordered the truck stopped so he could steal Alvarado's boots, but they couldn't find the victim in the dark and eventually left.\par \par \uc2 Police following a trail of blood the next morning found Alvarado's body in a ditch. The Mexican man had been stabbed at least 10 times, including wounds to his heart and liver.\par \par \uc2 Two months later, with Bustamante jailed on an unrelated charge in his home Wharton County, authorities notified Rosenberg police after receiving a tip he was involved in Alvarado's slaying.\par \par \uc2 "I don't need a judge and I don't need a jury to tell me I'm guilty," Bustamante, a former oil field worker, told detectives on the tape.\par \par \uc2 At the time, he and his brother, Bill, were charged with the beating and stabbing death of Lloyd Harold Turner, a 63-year-old man who lived under a highway overpass near El Campo. Bill Bustamante, who told authorities of other "shopping trips," took a 40-year prison term in a plea agreement in the Turner case.\par \par \uc2 Like the Alvarado slaying, Samuel Bustamante said he stabbed the homeless man. His brother beat the victim with a baseball bat in an attack spurred by a desire to "workout some aggravation," according to their confession.\par \par \uc2 "That was pretty bad evidence right there," Sid Crowley, Bustamante's trial lawyer, recalled. Crowley said he focused on trying to keep his client from being sent to death row.\par \par \uc2 "There never was any question about guilt-innocence," Crowley said. "He confessed to it."\par \par \uc2 Jim McAlister, a former assistant district attorney who handled Bustamante's case, said he remembered Bustamante for his brutality.\par \par \uc2 "Anybody can pull a trigger," McAlister, now a federal prosecutor, said. "But stabbing somebody, it's a whole different deal. And in the back of a truck? Moving?"\par \par \uc2 Depriest and the Escamilla brothers each received eight-year prison terms for aggravated robbery related to the Alvarado case.\par \par \uc2 Bustamante was listed in prison records as 5-foot-7 and 264 pounds. Known as "Fat Boy," he had at least three earlier convictions -- one in North Carolina for forgery and two others in Texas, one in Wharton County for burglary and one in Dallas for possession of a prohibited weapon while on parole.\par \par \uc2 Bustamante's execution, by lethal injection, would Texas' seventh this year. At least nine others are scheduled over the next three months in the nation's most active capital punishment state.\par \par \uc2 Kevin Varga, a 41-year-old inmate from Michigan, is scheduled to be executed in Texas on May 12 for fatally beating a North Carolina man with a hammer and tree limb. One of his accomplices, 41-year-old Billy Galloway, is scheduled for lethal injection the following day.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100426e64q0028n\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc45}{\*\bkmkend toc45}\b \uc2 Fairfax County puts jail inmates to work outside\b0\par\par\uc2 By DEREK KRAVITZ    \par \uc2 1,107 \uc2 words\par \uc2 26 April 2010\par 13:02\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2010.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.    \par \par \uc2 FAIRFAX, Va. (AP) - The vest-wearing, lawn-mower-pushing members of Fairfax County's modern chain gang don't look like jail inmates. Well-disciplined landscapers, yes. Orderly weed-whackers, perhaps. But not convicts. There are no chains, no handcuffs, no black-and-white striped jumpsuits. Just a handful of suntanned men wearing gray-and-orange uniforms.\par \par \uc2 But take a closer look, and you'll see the telltale signs that these aren't your normal grass cutters -- the faded gang tattoos, the jail-issued plastic ID bracelets, the armed sheriff's deputy patrolling nearby. Still, confusion is inevitable.\par \par \uc2 "We get a lot of people asking us for business cards, and we have to point to our sheriff's office logo and say, 'Sorry,' " said Sheriff's Deputy Michael Pence, as he watched a handful of inmates mow grass on a recent Friday near a county office building in McLean.\par \par \uc2 The inmates assigned to the 40-person crew on the Fairfax County Jail's Community Labor Force take care of lawns, pick up trash and paint over graffiti at roughly 50 county facilities, 300 bus shelters and nearly a dozen park-and-ride Metro stations.\par \par \uc2 The roadside chain gangs of the early 20th century, known through Sam Cooke's song and images of shackled, segregated work crews in the South, fell out of favor in the 1930s. But many local governments and states, including Maryland and Virginia, employ inmates to work in a host of money-earning public and private services. About 2,000 inmates in Maryland make everything from furniture and license plates to food products, and Virginia prison crews maintain rural highways through a contract. Revenue made through the program helps offset what it costs to feed inmates.\par \par \uc2 But over the past two years, Fairfax's quickly expanding program has taken on a new role: that of an unofficial complement to the cash-strapped Virginia Department of Transportation. County officials, facing an increasing number of phone calls from constituents upset about overgrown highway medians and poorly kept roads, have tasked the sheriff's office with a new variety of jobs.\par \par \uc2 The Great Depression forced many governments to turn over road construction projects to the rising number of jobless, said Alex Lichtenstein, an associate professor of history at Florida International University and author of "Twice the Work of Free Labor," which chronicles the history of prison labor in the South. "It's interesting to see the trend reversing," he said.\par \par \uc2 Nearly half of Fairfax's landscaping contracts go to the jail program. In fairly visible portions of Baileys Crossroads and downtown McLean, groups of about six inmates are noticeable enough to warrant the occasional honk from motorists and "thank-you"s from passersby.\par \par \uc2 During the February snowstorms, many parents saw the inmates working to remove several feet of snow from school sidewalks and offered their thanks by delivering coffee and doughnuts.\par \par \uc2 "It makes you feel good, like you're doing something positive," said Howard Fritts, 43, who was released this month after serving five months in the Fairfax jail for a parole violation stemming from a bad-check conviction in 2003.\par \par \uc2 Fritts, who is from Purcellville, said the tangible benefits don't hurt, either. Aside from getting a month off his sentence, he wrote a 50-page business plan for a new interior design company while in jail -- an idea he dreamed up while working outside -- after meeting a white-collar criminal in a nearby cell.\par \par \uc2 "It doesn't pay, but you could say it pays in other ways," Fritts said. Inmates who have met each other through the program have also been known to form informal networks after their release.\par \par \uc2 For every 30 days of work, participating county inmates get five days off their sentences. Those selected for the program are all volunteers, and inmates are screened to avoid putting any violent offenders back on the streets.\par \par \uc2 Fairfax Board of Supervisors Chairman Sharon Bulova (D) said the program, which was started more than a decade ago after a successful pilot project that used inmates to clean public parks, has been crucial in picking up where VDOT has left off, most recently in removing large mounds of dirt and trash that had piled up after the snowstorms.\par \par \uc2 "This is a creative use of resources, and it is encouraging," said Bulova, noting that civic associations and homeowners' groups can ask for the program's help.\par \par \uc2 The prisoners are county inmates, typically serving sentences of a year or less for a hodgepodge of crimes, including writing bad checks, drug offenses and failing to pay child support. A few are convicted felons serving state time, and they do not get the five days off for every month of work for good behavior, or "good time." Those felons say they work for free just to get the fresh air and avoid the almost inescapable boredom of watching TV and playing card games.\par \par \uc2 "I just wanted to be outside. It keeps me busy," said Loc Nguyen, 41, who emigrated from Saigon to Fairfax with his nine sisters in 1981 and is serving his second sentence for possession of crack cocaine. "I feel free out here."\par \par \uc2 Lt. Doug Byrd, supervisor of the county's chain gang unit, said calls from county officials and agencies have grown as VDOT's reach has lessened. In July, his team will begin maintaining 150 acres of public land near redeveloped Laurel Hill, the site of the former Lorton prison. Hiring private contractors to take care of the grass there would cost $130,000 per year, he said.\par \par \uc2 "These are guys just trying to repay their debts, and it helps us, too," he said.\par \par \uc2 State transportation officials say they appreciate the assistance, especially given the budget constraints that have befallen the state agency over the past two years.\par \par \uc2 "In these tough economic times, we absolutely welcome this sort of help," said Joan Morris, a VDOT spokeswoman.\par \par \uc2 Pence, the sheriff's deputy, said that in his eight years as a supervisor on the chain gang, he has heard of only one incident involving an inmate. That prisoner, a suspected \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , had asked a deputy whether he would be shot if he tried to escape. The answer was yes. Inmates on federal immigration detainers are no longer allowed to serve on the unit, Pence said.\par \par \uc2 "These aren't violent guys," he said. "They know what they're doing." Only one female inmate is involved with the program, and she works on a contract with the local animal shelter.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Information from: The Washington Post, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.washingtonpost.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.washingtonpost.com}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100426e64q00216\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

COOPER   \par \uc2 Associated Press Writers\par \uc2 986 \uc2 words\par \uc2 24 April 2010\par 19:46\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2010.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHOENIX (AP) - Arodi Berrelleza isn't one of the targets of Arizona's new law cracking down on illegal immigration -- he's a U.S. citizen, a student from Phoenix.\par \par \uc2 But the 18-year-old said he's afraid he'll be arrested anyway if police see him driving around with friends and relatives, some of them illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 "If a cop sees them and they look Mexican, he's going to stop me," Berrelleza said. "What if people are U.S. citizens? They're going to be asking them if they have papers because of the color of their skin."\par \par \uc2 Berrelleza's concerns were echoed by Hispanics across the state Saturday, a day after Gov. Jan Brewer signed a bill that requires police to question people about their immigration status -- including asking for identification -- if they suspect someone is in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 The new law, which will take effect in late July or early August, was cheered by many, including Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, whose tough crackdowns have made him a hero in the anti-illegal immigration community. He said it gives him new authority to detain undocumented migrants who aren't accused of committing any other crimes.\par \par \uc2 "Now if we show they're illegal, we can actually arrest them and put them in our jails," Arpaio said.\par \par \uc2 Current law in Arizona and most states doesn't require police to ask about the immigration status of those they come across, and many departments prohibit officers from inquiring out of fear immigrants won't report crime or cooperate in other investigations.\par \par \uc2 Now, police departments seen as weak on illegal immigration could face lawsuits. The new measure also toughens restrictions on hiring illegal immigrants for day labor and knowingly transporting them.\par \par \uc2 Arizona has an estimated 460,000 illegal immigrants and is the state with the most illegal border crossings, with the harsh, remote desert serving as the gateway for thousands of Mexicans and Central Americans.\par \par \uc2 Arpaio said he hoped Arizona's example coerces the federal government into acting to seal the border. President Barack Obama called the new law "misguided" Friday and instructed the Justice Department to examine it to see if it's legal, but also allowed that the failure to enact immigration reform at the national level left the door open to "irresponsibility by others."\par \par \uc2 "You're going to see a lot of interest with the politicians in Washington to get something done," Arpaio said. "Because I think they'll be afraid that other states will follow this new law that's now been passed."\par \par \uc2 Mexican President Felipe Calderon's office said in a statement Saturday that "the Mexican government condemns the approval of the law" and "the criminalization of migration, far from contributing to collaboration and cooperation between Mexico and the state of Arizona, represents an obstacle to solving the shared problems of the border region."\par \par \uc2 Mona Patton, a 58-year-old real estate agent from Prescott, said she's proud of Brewer and the Legislature for trying to protect people from violent drug cartels.\par \par \uc2 "When Arizonans aren't safe then something has to be done. We've got to let law enforcement handle things," Patton said.\par \par \uc2 A handful of protesters lingered at the state Capitol Saturday morning, with a bigger rally expected to draw hundreds on Sunday afternoon. Opponents of the law also gathered in Tucson outside the campaign headquarters of U.S. Rep. Raul Grijalva, a Democrat who opposes the measure and said his staff has been flooded with phone calls, some from people threatening violence and shouting racial slurs.\par \par \uc2 Brewer has ordered state officials to develop a training course for officers to learn what constitutes reasonable suspicion someone is in the U.S. illegally.\par \par \uc2 Civil rights advocates vowed to challenge the law in court, saying it would undoubtedly lead to racial profiling despite Brewer's assurances.\par \par \uc2 Supporters dismiss concerns about racial profiling, saying the law prohibits the use of race or nationality as the sole basis for an immigration check. The measure's sponsor, Republican Sen. Russell Pearce, said opponents are using racial profiling as a cover for their true concern -- deportation.\par \par \uc2 "This is not about profiling. They're worried about the laws being enforced," Pearce said.\par \par \uc2 Largely because of Arpaio's policies, Arizona was known for tough illegal immigration crackdowns even before Brewer signed the bill into law.\par \par \uc2 But Arpaio's jurisdiction is limited, and the new law will have its biggest impact in the rest of the state, where many police bosses have long resisted suggestions that their officers conduct day-to-day immigration enforcement, saying it would distract them from investigating other crimes and sow distrust among immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Immigrant advocates say the bill could worsen an already tenuous relationship between law enforcement and Hispanics in Arizona.\par \par \uc2 State Sen. Rebecca Rios, a Phoenix Democrat and fourth-generation Arizonan, said she's concerned about her 14-year-old son being harassed by police because of his brown skin, black hair and dark-brown eyes.\par \par \uc2 "I don't want my son or anyone else's son targeted simply because of their physical characteristics," Rios said. "There's no reason I should have to carry around any proof of citizenship, nor my son."\par \par \uc2 After Brewer signed the bill, a reporter asked if she knew what an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  looks like.\par \par \uc2 "I do not know what an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  looks like," Brewer said. "I can tell you there are people in Arizona who assume they know what an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  looks like. I don't know if they know that for a fact or not."\par \par \uc2 But she said with the training being developed for police officers, "the law will be enforced civilly, fairly and without discriminatory points to it."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writers Paul Davenport in Phoenix and Mark Stevenson in Mexico City contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100424e64o0004c\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Key provisions of Arizona's immigration legislation, signed into law by Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer on Friday:\par \par \uc2 -- Makes it a crime under state law to be in the country illegally by specifically requiring immigrants to have proof of their immigration status. Violations are a misdemeanor punishable by up to six months in jail and a fine of up to $2,500. Repeat offenses would be a felony.\par \par \uc2 -- Requires police officers to "make a reasonable attempt" to determine the immigration status of a person if there is a "reasonable suspicion" that he or she is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . Race, color or national origin may not be the only things considered in implementation. Exceptions can be made if the attempt would hinder an investigation.\par \par \uc2 -- Allow lawsuits against local or state government agencies that have policies that hinder enforcement of immigration laws. Would impose daily civil fines of $1,000-$5,000. There is pending follow-up legislation to halve the minimum to $500.\par \par \uc2 -- Targets hiring of illegal immigrants as day laborers by prohibiting people from stopping a vehicle on a road to offer employment and by prohibiting a person from getting into a stopped vehicle on a street to be hired for work if it impedes traffic.\par \par \uc2 -- The law will take effect by late July or early August.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100423e64n0027a\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

Jan Brewer ignored criticism from President Barack Obama on Friday and signed into law a bill supporters said would take handcuffs off police in dealing with illegal immigration in Arizona, the nation's busiest gateway for human and drug smuggling from Mexico.\par \par \uc2 With hundreds of protesters outside the state Capitol shouting that the bill would lead to civil rights abuses, Brewer said critics were "overreacting" and that she wouldn't tolerate racial profiling.\par \par \uc2 "We in Arizona have been more than patient waiting for Washington to act," Brewer said after signing the law. "But decades of inaction and misguided policy have created a dangerous and unacceptable situation."\par \par \uc2 Earlier Friday, Obama called the Arizona bill "misguided" and instructed the Justice Department to examine it to see if it's legal. He also said the federal government must enact immigration reform at the national level -- or leave the door open to "irresponsibility by others."\par \par \uc2 "That includes, for example, the recent efforts in Arizona, which threaten to undermine basic notions of fairness that we cherish as Americans, as well as the trust between police and their communities that is so crucial to keeping us safe," Obama said.\par \par \uc2 The legislation, sent to the Republican governor by the GOP-led Legislature, makes it a crime under state law to be in the country illegally. It also requires local police officers to question people about their immigration status if there is reason to suspect they are illegal immigrants; allows lawsuits against government agencies that hinder enforcement of immigration laws; and makes it illegal to hire illegal immigrants for day labor or knowingly transport them.\par \par \uc2 The law sends "a clear message that Arizona is unfriendly to undocumented aliens," said Peter Spiro, a Temple University law professor and author of the book "Beyond Citizenship: American Identity After Globalization."\par \par \uc2 Brewer signed the bill in a state auditorium about a mile from the Capitol complex where some 2,000 demonstrators booed county Supervisor Mary Rose Wilcox when she announced that "the governor did not listen to our prayers."\par \par \uc2 "It's going to change our lives," said Emilio Almodovar, a 13-year-old American citizen from Phoenix. "We can't walk to school any more. We can't be in the streets anymore without the pigs thinking we're illegal immigrants."\par \par \uc2 The Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund said it plans a legal challenge to the law, arguing it "launches Arizona into a spiral of pervasive fear, community distrust, increased crime and costly litigation, with nationwide repercussions."\par \par \uc2 Mexico has warned the proposal could affect cross-border relations. On Thursday, Mexico's Senate unanimously passed a resolution urging Brewer to veto the law.\par \par \uc2 "Police in Arizona already treat migrants worse than animals," said Francisco Loureiro, an activist who runs a migrant shelter in the border town of Nogales, Mexico. "There is already a hunt for migrants, and now it will be open season under the cover of a law."\par \par \uc2 The bill will take effect in late July or early August, and Brewer ordered the state's law enforcement licensing agency to develop a training course on how to implement it without violating civil rights.\par \par \uc2 "We must enforce the law evenly, and without regard to skin color, accent, or social status," she said. "We must prove the alarmists and the cynics wrong."\par \par \uc2 Brewer, who faces a tough election battle and growing anger in the state over illegal immigrants, said the law "protects every Arizona citizen."\par \par \uc2 Anti-immigrant anger has swelled in the past month, after rancher Rob Krentz was found dead on his land north of Douglas, near the Mexico border. Authorities believe he was fatally shot by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  possibly connected to a drug smuggling cartel.\par \par \uc2 Arizona has an estimated 460,000 illegal immigrants, and its harsh, remote desert serves as the corridor for the majority of illegal immigrants and drugs moving north into the U.S. from Mexico.\par \par \uc2 U.S. Rep. Raul Grijalva, a Democrat, said he closed his Arizona offices at noon Friday after his staff in Yuma and Tucson were flooded with calls this week, some from people threatening violent acts and shouting racial slurs. He called on businesses and groups looking for convention and meeting locations to boycott Arizona.\par \par \uc2 The bill's Republican sponsor, state Rep. Russell Pearce of Mesa, said Obama and other critics of the bill were "against law enforcement, our citizens and the rule of law."\par \par \uc2 Pearce said the legislation would remove "political handcuffs" from police and help drive illegal immigrants from the state.\par \par \uc2 "Illegal is illegal," said Pearce, a driving force on the issue in Arizona. "We'll have less crime. We'll have lower taxes. We'll have safer neighborhoods. We'll have shorter lines in the emergency rooms. We'll have smaller classrooms."\par \par \uc2 ----\par \par \uc2 Associated Press Writer Julie Pace in Washington contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 5\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100423e64n0007q\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

Metro spokeswoman Lisa Farbstein says the driver had been on paid administrative leave since the April 2nd incident and was fired Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 Adamson had been operating the U2 bus route when he was pulled over after an argument with a motorist.\par \par \uc2 The incident was the latest firing in a string of employee offenses. Last week, Metro fired a bus driver arrested for allegedly soliciting sex from an undercover police officer while driving a bus. A MetroAccess driver was fired this month after being charged with sexually assaulting a customer.\par \par \uc2 SEXUAL ASSAULT-ELDERLY VICTIM\par \par \uc2 Seniors program driver admits to assaulting client\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) -- A former van driver who transported elderly people to a program for senior citizens with depression has pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting a client.\par \par \uc2 Fifty-seven-year-old Tilaye Teshome Wake entered plea Wednesday to one count of first-degree sexual abuse of a ward, patient, client or prisoner. He faces between six months and two years in prison when he is sentenced in D.C. Superior Court on June 25th.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors say Wake transported a 75-year-old woman to the day program on several days in January. On February 1st, Wake called the victim and asked if she would like a ride to the program. She said she wasn't feeling well and wouldn't be going. Later in the day, Wake showed up at the woman's southeast Washington apartment, where he assaulted her.\par \par \uc2 ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS\par \par \uc2 PW Co. police detail '09 \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  arrests\par \par \uc2 MANASSAS, Va. (AP) -- Police say six percent of people arrested in Prince William County last year were illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 County police recorded 1,197 illegal immigrants arrested on criminal charges in 2009. Of those, 88 percent were charged with misdemeanors or traffic violations.\par \par \uc2 The county joined a federal program in 2008 that trains local officials on how to enforce federal immigration laws. Last year was the first full year of data gathered for the program.\par \par \uc2 In addition, figures show the overall crime rate in Prince William has reached a 15-year low. But there's been a nearly 11 percent increase in violent crimes compared to 2008. Police say the jump is due to more reported rapes -- from 28 to 57 in 2009.\par \par \uc2 CARBON TAX\par \par \uc2 Carbon tax proposal could cost Mirant millions\par \par \uc2 ROCKVILLE, Md. (AP) -- A proposed carbon tax has started a dispute between a county lawmaker and a power plant operator.\par \par \uc2 Montgomery County Council member and energy lawyer Roger Berliner has proposed a $5 tax on each ton of carbon dioxide released by major polluters. Only a Mirant plant near Poolesville that generates more than 2 million tons of carbon dioxide a year would be affected.\par \par \uc2 A Mirant spokeswoman says the proposal won't cut greenhouse gases, but will only burden a business that employs 150 in the county. Misty Allen say Maryland already is part of a regional greenhouse gas initiative in which the company participates.\par \par \uc2 Berliner says his tax will help improve that initiative.\par \par \uc2 DEPUTY STRUCK\par \par \uc2 Police: Man drove car into Prince George's deputy\par \par \uc2 TEMPLE HILLS, Md. (AP) -- Authorities say a man drove his car into an off-duty Prince George's County sheriff's deputy who was providing security at a nightclub.\par \par \uc2 Sheriff's office spokeswoman Sergeant Yakeisha Hines said two off-duty deputies were working security at Club Elite in Temple Hills, Maryland, when a fight broke out in the parking lot just after 1 a.m. Thursday. Hines says one of the men in the fight apparently turned on one of the deputies and then after a struggle, the man jumped into a car and struck the deputy.\par \par \uc2 Both deputies fired shots at the car, hitting the man. Hines says it's unclear how many shots were fired. The man, the deputy who was struck and two others were hospitalized with minor injuries.\par \par \uc2 Hines says the man and two other suspects are in custody. She says charges are pending.\par \par \uc2 UNIVERSITY ARRESTS-BEATING\par \par \uc2 U-Md. hands over missing video in beating case\par \par \uc2 COLLEGE PARK, Md. (AP) -- University of Maryland officials have handed over missing surveillance footage to attorneys for a student who was beaten by Prince George's County police.\par \par \uc2 The 90 minutes of footage had been missing from about 60 hours of video subpoenaed by the lawyers. They hoped it could help shed light on what happened March 3rd, when police in riot gear confronted rowdy basketball fans after Maryland defeated Duke.\par \par \uc2 A separate video taken by a student shows three county police officers in riot gear beating student John McKenna.\par \par \uc2 A campus police spokesman says officials were never trying to hide the footage from the university's cameras. He says about three minutes of footage is still missing because of a technician's error.\par \par \uc2 McKenna's lawyers say they aren't satisfied with the explanation.\par \par \uc2 UNCLE SLAIN\par \par \uc2 Va. teen charged in uncle's shooting death\par \par \uc2 MANASSAS, Va.

He later died at the scene.\par \par \uc2 Police say 18-year-old Davion Howard was arrested after an officer called to the scene spotted him walking away from the home in clothes covered in blood.\par \par \uc2 Davion Howard is charged with murder, use of a firearm in the commission of a felony and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100422e64m000np\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHOENIX (AP) - Officials from Arizona told U.S. senators on Tuesday that drug and immigrant smuggling violence along the U.S.-Mexico border has worsened over the last year.\par \par \uc2 The officials told senators at a hearing in Washington that the United States hasn't seen the level of violence that Mexico is experiencing in its war against drug cartels. But criminals headed back to Mexico commit burglaries and home invasions along remote stretches of border, illegal immigrants are robbed and assaulted in their journey into the U.S. Drug and immigrant smugglers who have more limited trafficking routes also are stealing from each other and kidnapping rivals in Arizona, a busy hub for transporting illegal immigrants and marijuana into the United States.\par \par \uc2 "It is worse, and it is getting worse," Cochise County Sheriff Larry Dever said of the violence.\par \par \uc2 The purpose of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee's hearing was to see what federal, state and local officials can do to control the border, said Sen. Joe Lieberman, the independent from Connecticut who is the leader of committee.\par \par \uc2 Alan Bersin, commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, said the Obama administration came up with a plan more than a year ago to keep violence from spilling across the border.\par \par \uc2 Those efforts include trying to stop drug smugglers from sneaking guns and cash back into Mexico and having American prosecutors work with their Mexican counterparts to make sure smugglers are punished.\par \par \uc2 Under questioning from Lieberman, Bersin said 600 miles of border fencing and a $770 million network of cameras, ground sensors and radars known as the "virtual fence" weren't stopping the flow of illegal immigrants into the country. "It doesn't seal the border," Bersin said.\par \par \uc2 Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona, a member of the committee, advocated sending National Guard troops to the border to improve border security.\par \par \uc2 The latest major example of border violence cited at the hearing was the March 27 death of rancher Robert Krentz, who was shot on his ranch near Douglas, Ariz. Authorities provided a few details into the investigation of his death.\par \par \uc2 Dever, whose office is investigating the killing, said the rancher is believed to have been killed by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who was headed back to Mexico and worked as a scout for drug smugglers. Scouts generally serve as mountaintop lookouts for drug smugglers, instructing the drivers for smuggling rings to pull over and hide when authorities are nearby.\par \par \uc2 Dennis Burke, U.S. attorney for Arizona, said federal authorities were culling its cases from the area of the killing to look for leads. Burke said it's too early to link Krentz's killing to a particular smuggling group.\par \par \uc2 After hearing a crushing amount of statistics on the massive volume of drugs seized and illegal immigrants arrested in Arizona, Dever said, "All of it added up to a big fat zero for Rob Krentz."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100420e64k002qb\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 LOS ANGELES (AP) - The head of the nation's largest Roman Catholic archdiocese has condemned a proposed Arizona crackdown on illegal immigrants, saying it encourages people to turn on each other in Nazi- and Soviet-style repression.\par \par \uc2 The measure wrongly assumes that Arizonans "will now shift their total attention to guessing which Latino-looking or foreign-looking person may or may not have proper documents," Cardinal Roger Mahony said in his blog Sunday -- a day before Arizona's Legislature sent the immigration enforcement measure to the Republican governor.\par \par \uc2 Gov. Jan Brewer has not indicated whether she will sign the bill, which creates a new state misdemeanor of willful failure to complete or carry an alien registration document. It would also require officers to determine people's immigration status if there's reason to suspect they're in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 Arizona has an estimated 460,000 illegal immigrants. Proponents of the bill say it was prompted by concerns over the cost of providing services to illegal immigrants and by the slaying of an Arizona rancher near the Mexican border this month. Authorities believe he was fatally shot by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  possibly connected to a drug smuggling cartel.\par \par \uc2 Republican Arizona Sen. Russell Pearce, who sponsored the bill, has said it will take handcuffs off police and put them on violent criminals.\par \par \uc2 But Mahony, whose archdiocese has a huge Hispanic immigrant population, said the Arizona Legislature was passing "the country's most retrogressive, mean-spirited, and useless anti-immigrant law."\par \par \uc2 Similar laws that were previously passed in other states have been repealed or struck down in the courts, he said.\par \par \uc2 "The tragedy of the law is its totally flawed reasoning: that immigrants come to our country to rob, plunder, and consume public resources," Mahony said.\par \par \uc2 "I can't imagine Arizonans now reverting to German Nazi and Russian Communist techniques whereby people are required to turn one another in to the authorities on any suspicion of documentation," the cardinal said. "Are children supposed to call 911 because one parent does not have proper papers? Are family members and neighbors now supposed to spy on one another, create total distrust across neighborhoods and communities, and report people because of suspicions based upon appearance?"\par \par \uc2 Provisions of the proposed law make it illegal for people to knowingly transport illegal immigrants or hire them for day labor, but it does not require regular citizens to report immigration violations.\par \par \uc2 A separate Arizona law already punishes companies caught knowingly hiring illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100420e64k002fg\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

COOPER   \par \uc2 Associated Press Writer\par \uc2 464 \uc2 words\par \uc2 19 April 2010\par 18:43\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2010.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHOENIX (AP) - After the shooting death of a rancher, Sens. Jon Kyl and John McCain once again called Monday for National Guard troops to be deployed along Arizona's border with Mexico.\par \par \uc2 The request for 3,000 troops was part of a 10-point plan that also includes hiring 3,000 more Customs and Border Protection agents for Arizona, building new fences along the border and increasing aerial surveillance.\par \par \uc2 The Arizona senators, both Republicans, said in a conference call with reporters that they would introduce federal legislation to implement their plan.\par \par \uc2 Gov. Jan Brewer requested a year ago that President Barack Obama deploy National Guard troops along the border. The senators supported her request at the time, but the Obama administration has not acted.\par \par \uc2 The latest proposal followed the death last month of rancher Rob Krentz on his land north of Douglas. Authorities believe he was fatally shot by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  possibly connected to a drug smuggling cartel.\par \par \uc2 "While we have the nation's attention, it's important that we strike now and we get these suggestions implemented now, because I really feel the window of opportunity will close very quickly," said Cochise County Sheriff Larry Dever, whose office is investigating the killing.\par \par \uc2 McCain and Kyl also want to expand a program known as Operation Streamline that charges illegal immigrants with low-level crimes and requires them to spend time in jail instead of being immediately deported.\par \par \uc2 Kyl credited the program with reducing illegal immigration along stretches of the border where it's used.\par \par \uc2 Other elements of the plan include calls for more Border Patrol stations in the Tucson Sector, more horse patrols and a full-time federal magistrate in Cochise County.\par \par \uc2 It requests increased funding for programs that reimburse state and local authorities for their costs of detaining illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 "The communities in Arizona that suffer the negative impacts from illegal border crossings and the lawlessness along the southern border deserve the full support of the federal government," McCain said.\par \par \uc2 McCain is fighting off a primary challenge from the right. His opponent, former congressman J.D. Hayworth, has accused McCain of not doing enough to secure the border.\par \par \uc2 McCain said the new plan was not politically motivated and defended his record on the issue, saying he's been calling for more border security for years.\par \par \uc2 The senators' plan follows an 18-point plan released by the Arizona Cattle Growers Association, a lobbying group that also called for military deployment.\par \par \uc2 In 2006, President George W. Bush deployed National Guard troops along the border for a two-year assignment building fences, conducting surveillance and performing administrative tasks while recruiting and training new agents.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100419e64j003l4\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

COOPER   \par \uc2 Associated Press Writer\par \uc2 464 \uc2 words\par \uc2 19 April 2010\par 17:38\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2010.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHOENIX (AP) - After the shooting death of a rancher, Sens. Jon Kyl and John McCain once again called Monday for National Guard troops to be deployed along Arizona's border with Mexico.\par \par \uc2 The request for 3,000 troops was part of a 10-point plan that also includes hiring 3,000 more Customs and Border Protection agents for Arizona, building new fences along the border and increasing aerial surveillance.\par \par \uc2 The Arizona senators, both Republicans, said in a conference call with reporters that they would introduce federal legislation to implement their plan.\par \par \uc2 They made a similar call for National Guard troops a year ago, but it failed to gain political traction. A number of similar proposals have been made by state politicians in recent years.\par \par \uc2 The latest proposal followed the death last month of rancher Rob Krentz on his land north of Douglas. Authorities believe he was fatally shot by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  possibly connected to a drug smuggling cartel.\par \par \uc2 "While we have the nation's attention, it's important that we strike now and we get these suggestions implemented now, because I really feel the window of opportunity will close very quickly," said Cochise County Sheriff Larry Dever, whose office is investigating the killing.\par \par \uc2 McCain and Kyl also want to expand a program known as Operation Streamline that charges illegal immigrants with low-level crimes and requires them to spend time in jail instead of being immediately deported.\par \par \uc2 Kyl credited the program with reducing illegal immigration along stretches of the border where it's used.\par \par \uc2 Other elements of the plan include calls for more Border Patrol stations in the Tucson Sector, more horse patrols and a full-time federal magistrate in Cochise County.\par \par \uc2 It requests increased funding for programs that reimburse state and local authorities for their costs of detaining illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 "The communities in Arizona that suffer the negative impacts from illegal border crossings and the lawlessness along the southern border deserve the full support of the federal government," McCain said.\par \par \uc2 McCain is fighting off a primary challenge from the right. His opponent, former congressman J.D. Hayworth, has accused McCain of not doing enough to secure the border.\par \par \uc2 McCain said the new plan was not politically motivated and defended his record on the issue, saying he's been calling for more border security for years.\par \par \uc2 The senators' plan follows an 18-point plan released by the Arizona Cattle Growers Association, a lobbying group that also called for military deployment.\par \par \uc2 In 2006, President George W. Bush deployed National Guard troops along the border for a two-year assignment building fences, conducting surveillance and performing administrative tasks while recruiting and training new agents.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100419e64j003ha\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SEATTLE (AP) - The Washington state Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that a man's undocumented immigrant status in the U.S. should not have been introduced in a trial while the man sought damages in a negligence lawsuit against a construction contractor.\par \par \uc2 In a 7-2 ruling, the state's high court reversed a state Court of Appeals decision to uphold a jury verdict against Alex Salas.\par \par \uc2 The question before the court revolved around the issue of whether Salas' immigration status affects his claim for future wages, given that he is illegally in the country.\par \par \uc2 The jury found the construction contractor had been negligent but did not award any monetary damages to him.\par \par \uc2 "I knew justice wasn't being done," said Salas' attorney Robert B. Kornfeld. "Here you have someone who violates (workers' safety) and they get away with it, because this guy was undocumented? That wasn't right."\par \par \uc2 A Mexican native, Salas was working on a construction project in Seattle in 2002 when he fell from a ladder provided by Hi-Tech Erectors.\par \par \uc2 He was seriously injured and sued the contractor two years later, alleging that the ladder did not meet safety codes. According to court documents, the day of the fall was wet, and the ladder did not have a textured surface to prevent slipping.\par \par \uc2 Salas suffered back, hip and ankle injures, including multiple fractures in joints. Kornfeld said Salas' medical bills went up to $150,000 and that he faces a hip replacement. "Eventually one day, he will be very crippled," Kornfeld said.\par \par \uc2 Salas sought up to a $1 million in damages.\par \par \uc2 But just before the lawsuit went to trial, Salas' status as an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  was revealed during the deposition of his psychiatrist. Salas' team moved to exclude that fact from trial, pointing out that immigration was a hot-button issue that may cloud a jury's ruling. But their request was denied.\par \par \uc2 Attorney Matthew Boyle, who represented Hi-Tech Erectors, said Salas had not disclosed his immigration status to him or his own lawyer.\par \par \uc2 "Up to that point in time, we both believed we worked here legally because that's what he told us," Boyle said.\par \par \uc2 Boyle, though, said that Salas' immigration status wasn't something his case revolved around. "It really wasn't a central focus, we were defending on the liability issues."\par \par \uc2 Salas entered the country in 1989 on a visa. Court documents state he applied for legal status, but did not hear back. His visa expired in 1994, and has since lived here undocumented. Salas is married and is a father of three. He now lives in Texas.\par \par \uc2 Boyle said they are weighing their options and may ask the high court to reconsider. Kornfeld said that they will seek a new trial if Hi-Tech Erectors does not want to settle.\par \par \uc2 The state Supreme Court said admitting Salas' immigration status presented "the danger of unfair prejudice."\par \par \uc2 Writing on behalf of the two justices who dissented, Justice Gerry L. Alexander said the trial court's admission of Salas' immigration status was not "manifestly unreasonable."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100415e64f0025r\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

Foot tracks were followed from the shooting scene about 20 miles (30 kilometers) south, to the Mexico border, and authorities suspect an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The killing of the third-generation rancher has become a flashpoint in the immigration debate as politicians cite the episode as further proof that the United States must do more to secure the violent U.S.-Mexico border.\par \par \uc2 The governors of New Mexico and Arizona took a public tour of the border this week in support of more security. The subject has ignited endless discussion on blogs, and has been politicized in the U.S. Senate Republican primary brawl between JD Hayworth, a conservative talk radio host and former congressman, and incumbent John McCain, the party's 2008 presidential nominee.\par \par \uc2 Hayworth has accused McCain of not doing enough to protect U.S. citizens from growing border violence. McCain, for his part, has called for increased security in response to the killing.\par \par \uc2 "The federal government must do all it can within its power to curb this violence and protect its citizens from criminals coming across the border from Mexico," McCain wrote in a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, a former Arizona governor.\par \par \uc2 Krentz will be remembered at a funeral Saturday in Douglas, about 35 miles (55 kilometers) southwest of his 35,000-acre (14,000-hectare) ranch and the home where he raised three children with his wife of 33 years, Sue.\par \par \uc2 Investigators have not definitively tied the killing to the drug trade, but the slaying comes at a time when well-armed cartel factions have battled each other and federal authorities in several Mexican border cities, resulting in thousands of brutal killings.\par \par \uc2 The violence has been concentrated in Mexico's Ciudad Juarez on the Texas border and Tijuana, just south of San Diego, and hasn't yet spilled over into Arizona's remote border region.\par \par \uc2 Krentz's death sparked fears that was changing.\par \par \uc2 The Krentz family was no stranger to the problems of illegal immigration. Their home was robbed, and Krentz once found the carcass of one of his calves that had been killed for food, presumably by starving immigrants.\par \par \uc2 But the soft-spoken rancher bore no ill will toward illegal immigrants, according to friends and family.\par \par \uc2 They say Krentz sympathized with their desire for a better life in the U.S. He gave them food and water if they were in distress, and sometimes he'd call the U.S. Border Patrol, which meant deportation but also guarantees of medical assistance and escape from possible death.\par \par \uc2 "If they come and ask for water, I'll still give them water," Krentz once told PBS' Religion & Ethics Newsweekly in 1999. "You know, that's just my nature."\par \par \uc2 Wendy Glenn, who has a ranch south of the Krentz property and is a good family friend, said she believes she heard some of Krentz's last words when he used a radio to talk to his brother the day he was killed.\par \par \uc2 "He says, 'I see an immigrant out here, and he appears to need help. Call the Border Patrol,'" Glenn, 69, said she heard Krentz say at about 10:30 a.m. on March 27. "He was not frantic. He was not calling for help."\par \par \uc2 After Krentz went missing for hours and hadn't communicated with anyone, Glenn said she and others assumed he'd been robbed and stranded somewhere on his property. But his body was found just before midnight in a remote area of his land.\par \par \uc2 After he was shot, the 58-year-old Krentz managed to drive away in his all-terrain vehicle before losing consciousness and dying from his wounds. Nothing had been stolen from him, and his gun was still in its holster. His dog was killed, too.\par \par \uc2 Glenn and those who knew Krentz say he never would have confronted anyone he thought was dangerous. Most likely, he was just trying to help, they say.\par \par \uc2 "There are a lot of people out here who are unarmed that need help, and I'm sure Rob didn't realize he was armed," Glenn said. "I think he approached to see if he could help him and the guy thought maybe he was going to get arrested, that maybe Rob was the law ... I don't know what the guy thought, but he never gave Rob a chance."\par \par \uc2 She said Krentz was modest, honest and an unwavering friend, and that everyone who knew him is "absolutely devastated."\par \par \uc2 "I keep expecting to see Rob walk in the door," she said. "The reality now is very hard to face. That man is gone forever."\par \par \uc2 Krentz's family members declined requests for comment, but released a statement saying he was a humanitarian "who bore no ill will toward anyone" and instilled in his children the importance of honesty and fair dealing.\par \par \uc2 The family said they hold no malice toward the Mexican people and blame the U.S. and Mexican governments for the killing.\par \par \uc2 "Their disregard of our repeated pleas and warnings of impending violence toward our community fell on deaf ears shrouded in political correctness," according to the statement. "As a result, we have paid the ultimate price for their negligence in credibly securing our borderlands."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100410e64a0000j\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

He was not calling for help."\par \par \uc2 After Krentz went missing for hours and hadn't communicated with anyone, Glenn said she and others assumed he'd been robbed and stranded somewhere on his property. But his body was found just before midnight in a remote area of his land.\par \par \uc2 After he was shot, the 58-year-old Krentz managed to drive away in his all-terrain vehicle before losing consciousness and dying from his wounds. Nothing had been stolen from him, and his gun was still in its holster. His dog was killed, too.\par \par \uc2 Glenn and those who knew Krentz say he never would have confronted anyone he thought was dangerous. Most likely, he was just trying to help, they say.\par \par \uc2 "There are a lot of people out here who are unarmed that need help, and I'm sure Rob didn't realize he was armed," Glenn said. "I think he approached to see if he could help him and the guy thought maybe he was going to get arrested, that maybe Rob was the law ... I don't know what the guy thought, but he never gave Rob a chance."\par \par \uc2 She said Krentz was modest, honest and an unwavering friend, and that everyone who knew him is "absolutely devastated."\par \par \uc2 "I keep expecting to see Rob walk in the door," she said. "The reality now is very hard to face. That man is gone forever."\par \par \uc2 Krentz's family members declined requests for comment, but released a statement saying he was a humanitarian "who bore no ill will toward anyone" and instilled in his children the importance of honesty and fair dealing.\par \par \uc2 The family said they hold no malice toward the Mexican people and blame the U.S. and Mexican governments for the killing.\par \par \uc2 "Their disregard of our repeated pleas and warnings of impending violence toward our community fell on deaf ears shrouded in political correctness," according to the statement. "As a result, we have paid the ultimate price for their negligence in credibly securing our borderlands."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100409e649002l3\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.  \par \par \uc2 NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - The bodies of the three friends were found slumped near a playground wall, each killed by a shot to the head. Nearby, a fourth lay clinging to life after being shot and stabbed.\par \par \uc2 The barbarity of the August 2007 killings -- a machete was believed used in the attack, and at least one victim was sexually assaulted -- jolted a city already familiar with the human wreckage produced by the toxic mix of drugs, gangs and firearms. A series of anti-crime reforms followed that have been credited with reducing Newark's violent crime rate.\par \par \uc2 The events of that night will be relived in detail over the next several weeks when the first of six defendants stands trial on three counts of murder. Jury selection in New Jersey vs. Rodolfo Godinez is scheduled to begin Friday, with the trial expected to begin late next week.\par \par \uc2 "I would call it a breaking point, where suddenly from around the city as well as outside the city people were saying, 'We've got to do more,'" Mayor Cory Booker said this week. "So suddenly we had more hands on deck, more people volunteering, willing to organize for the safety of our community."\par \par \uc2 The victims all lived in Newark but were students at Delaware State University; they had managed to avoid the lure of Newark's notoriously mean streets and were simply hanging out on a hot summer night at the Mount Vernon School playground.\par \par \uc2 One of the enduring mysteries of the case has been why such a seemingly benign group of youths was targeted. As the case goes to trial, the city stands to learn more about what exactly happened.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors appear to be laying the groundwork for a theory that the killings were part of a gang initiation, not a robbery gone awry, as initially thought. Among the details revealed at a pretrial hearing this week were the contents of text messages between two of the victims just before the attack:\par \par \uc2 "Itst2go." (It's time to go.)\par \par \uc2 The response, 30 seconds later: "4Y?" (For why?)\par \par \uc2 The time was 11:30 p.m. Minutes later, the 911 call came in reporting shots fired.\par \par \uc2 Killed were Terrance Aeriel, 18, and Iofemi Hightower and Dashon Harvey, both 20. The fourth victim, who survived and is expected to testify at Godinez's trial, is not being identified by The Associated Press because of sexual assault charges against two other defendants.\par \par \uc2 Newark was a booming industrial city at mid-century but took a downturn after its famous race riots of the 1960s, and continued its decline for years. By the end of 2006, murders were at 107 that year, up 50 percent from the late 1990s.\par \par \uc2 The situation grew so dire that Newark's teachers' union posted billboards around the city that screamed: "HELP WANTED: Stop the Killings in Newark Now!"\par \par \uc2 The schoolyard killings appeared to signal a turning point, encapsulated on an emotionally wrenching day of funerals for the three victims, when Booker pounded a podium at Newark's Metropolitan Baptist Church and shouted, "Enough is enough!"\par \par \uc2 Some changes were swift. Within three weeks, the state's attorney general gave New Jersey police the authority to refer violent crime suspects' names to immigration authorities if they were suspected of being in the country illegally -- a response to the fact that one of the six schoolyard killings suspects was free on bail for other crimes despite being an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The publicity surrounding the killings jump-started an effort to buy and install surveillance cameras and a gunshot-detection system in the city's most dangerous neighborhoods. Other changes followed, including the instituting of penalties for gun owners who fail to report lost or stolen weapons, and a first-of-its-kind agreement to allow all New Jersey municipalities access to a federal gun-tracing database.\par \par \uc2 By the end of 2008, Newark's murder rate had dropped by nearly 40 percent, though it rose last year from 68 to 79. Shootings have decreased substantially, as well.\par \par \uc2 "I was inspired by the way our city didn't let that terrible act break us apart," Booker said, "but instead brought us together."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100408e64800210\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

(AP) - Govs. Jan Brewer of Arizona and Bill Richardson of New Mexico took a helicopter tour of the Mexican border on Wednesday to get border security updates and an aerial view of the site where a rancher was fatally shot 11 days ago.\par \par \uc2 Brewer said she saw smuggling routes, would-be illegal border-crossers waiting to cross into Arizona and the arrests of illegal immigrants who were crossing the desert with their belongings in plastic bags.\par \par \uc2 Richardson was briefed on National Guard operations at the border. A few days after the rancher was killed, Richardson ordered state police and the National Guard to beef up surveillance and patrols in the area.\par \par \uc2 Brewer has asked the federal government to pay for sending 250 National Guard troops to her state's border to supplement the 150 troops already there, as part of a long-standing border assistance program.\par \par \uc2 Investigators believe the gunman who shot rancher Robert Krentz in southeastern Arizona was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , but they don't know whether he was a rank-and-file immigrant who came to the United States to work a legitimate job or whether he was a smuggler.\par \par \uc2 U.S. Homeland Security spokesman Matt Chandler said the federal government has put people along the border to combat potential threats of violence tied to smuggling.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100408e64800012\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

(AP) - An \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  was sentenced Monday to 60 years in prison for a crash that killed three people, including a 3-year-old boy inside a Colorado ice cream shop.\par \par \uc2 Francis Hernandez, 26, of Guatemala was sentenced for the deaths of Marten Kudlis, Deborah Serecky and Patricia Guntharp.\par \par \uc2 Marten's father, Murat Kudlis, said during sentencing that he wanted Hernandez to receive the maximum sentence.\par \par \uc2 "We miss (Marten) very much," the father said. "My wife is pregnant with a little girl and she will never know her big brother."\par \par \uc2 A jury convicted Hernandez of vehicular homicide and other charges in February.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors said Hernandez was driving an SUV at twice the speed limit when it crashed into a pickup truck carrying the two women. The truck then crashed into an ice cream store in the east-Denver suburb of Aurora in September 2008.\par \par \uc2 The case sparked calls for immigration reform after it became known that Hernandez had avoided deportation despite a dozen prior arrests in Colorado. Authorities said he used 12 aliases and two dates of birth to slip under the radar of immigration officials.\par \par \uc2 Before he was sentenced by District Judge John Wheeler, Hernandez took the stand and read a letter begging for mercy and apologizing to the victims' families. He also said he has two little girls who need him.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100406e6460002r\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) - A teenage girl who converted to Christianity and ran away from home is being blocked by her Muslim parents from fighting the possibility of deportation, her attorney told a judge Monday in an ongoing custody dispute.\par \par \uc2 Rifqa Bary, 17, who fled home last year and stayed with a Florida minister whom she met on \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  and does not want to be returned to her native Sri Lanka because she fears being harmed or killed by Muslim extremists.\par \par \uc2 Her attorney, Angela Lloyd, asked a judge to sign an order stating that reunification with her parents is not possible by her 18th birthday in August.\par \par \uc2 The order would allow Bary, who is in foster care, to apply for special immigration status without her parents' consent.\par \par \uc2 Omar Tarazi, an attorney for the parents, objected, telling the judge that he had been unaware of this latest maneuver by Bary's attorney to apply to an immigration court. He said the parents previously filed an immigration application for the whole family.\par \par \uc2 Franklin County Juvenile Court Judge Elizabeth Gill declined to issue the order without first holding a hearing next month. She also declined to remove a gag order that prevents attorneys from discussing the case publicly.\par \par \uc2 Bary and her parents, Mohamed and Aysha Bary, have agreed to follow a counseling plan drawn up by a county child welfare agency to try to resolve the family's conflict. It requires both sides to work with individual counselors and to try to attend join counseling.\par \par \uc2 But a face-to-face meeting remains unlikely any time soon.\par \par \uc2 Jim Zorn, a children's services attorney, told the judge that Bary continues to believe that a reconciliation with her parents is impossible. Bary's counselor has indicated that contact with her parents would be premature, he said.\par \par \uc2 Bary has also complained that her parents have not responded to an emotional letter sent to them through a counselor that explains why their relationship broke down, Lloyd said.\par \par \uc2 The letter was more like a list of 20 questions that felt like a backdoor interrogation prepared by attorneys, Tarazi said. It included questions such as, "Why don't I have happy memories of my childhood?" he said.\par \par \uc2 The parents want to respond but also want assurances that Bary's attorneys are not interfering with the process, Tarazi said.\par \par \uc2 Judge Gill ordered both attorneys to stay away from the counselors.\par \par \uc2 Bary's case has drawn national attention, especially among bloggers, with anti-Islam groups warning she could face death and some Muslim groups saying she's being exploited by outsiders.\par \par \uc2 The girl ran away last July, saying she couldn't stay with her parents because she feared for her life for converting to Christianity. Authorities found no evidence that she faced harm in Ohio.\par \par \uc2 Police in Columbus continue to investigate whether anyone broke the law by helping Bary run away.\par \par \uc2 Bary's father alleges a Columbus minister drove her to a Greyhound station where she received a bus ticket and took a bus to Orlando, Fla. There, she stayed with a minister and his wife for about two weeks before the state of Florida took custody of her and returned her to Ohio.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100405e645002m7\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Afghan lawmakers say President Hamid Karzai threatened to quit politics, join Taliban\par \par \uc2 KABUL (AP) -- Afghan President Hamid Karzai threatened over the weekend to quit the political process and join the Taliban if he continued to come under outside pressure to reform, several members of parliament said Monday.\par \par \uc2 Karzai made the unusual statement at a closed-door meeting Saturday with selected lawmakers -- just days after kicking up a diplomatic controversy with remarks alleging foreigners were behind fraud in last year's disputed elections.\par \par \uc2 Lawmakers dismissed the latest comment as hyperbole, but it will add to the impression the president -- who relies on tens of thousands of U.S. and NATO forces to fight the insurgency and prop up his government -- is growing increasingly erratic and unable to exert authority without attacking his foreign backers.\par \par \uc2 "He said that 'if I come under foreign pressure, I might join the Taliban'," said Farooq Marenai, who represents the eastern province of Nangarhar.\par \par \uc2 "He said rebelling would change to resistance," Marenai said -- apparently suggesting that the militant movement would then be redefined as one of resistance against a foreign occupation rather than a rebellion against an elected government.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Record $16M fine leveled against Toyota over slow recalls; company said to have 'hid' defect\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government is seeking to fine Toyota a record $16.4 million, accusing the Japanese auto giant of hiding a "dangerous defect" in its slow reporting of faulty gas pedals that have been blamed for unintended sudden accelerations and motorists' deaths.\par \par \uc2 The proposed fine, announced Monday by Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, is the most the government could levy for the sticking gas pedals that have led Toyota to recall millions of vehicles. There could be further penalties under continuing federal investigations, and Toyota also faces private lawsuits seeking many millions more.\par \par \uc2 Toyota Motor Corp\uc2 . has recalled more than 6 million vehicles in the U.S., and more than 8 million worldwide, because of acceleration problems in multiple models and braking issues in the Prius hybrid.\par \par \uc2 Documents obtained from the Japanese automaker show that Toyota knew of the problem with the sticking gas pedals in late September but did not issue a recall until late January, LaHood said. The sticking pedals involved 2.3 million vehicles.\par \par \uc2 "We now have proof that Toyota failed to live up to its legal obligations," LaHood said in a statement. "Worse yet, they knowingly hid a dangerous defect for months from U.S. officials and did not take action to protect millions of drivers and their families."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Tiger Woods says 'nothing's changed' and thinks he can win Masters after personal scandal\par \par \uc2 AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- While acknowledging he made some "incredibly poor decisions" in his personal life, Tiger Woods still thinks he can win the Masters -- even coming back from a five-month layoff.\par \par \uc2 "Nothing's changed," Woods said Monday during an extraordinary 35-minute news conference at Augusta National. "I'm going to go out there and try to win this thing."\par \par \uc2 In his first full-fledged session with the media since his life fell apart, Woods entered the interview room with a smile on his face and stopped to hug one of the green-jacketed club members, Ron Townsend.\par \par \uc2 Woods again took full blame for his personal failings, but stopped short of providing many new details. He wouldn't say why he entered rehab for 45 days nor would he go into specifics about his infamous Thanksgiving night car crash, other than to say it took five stitches to close a lip wound.\par \par \uc2 "All I know is I acted just terribly," said Woods, sporting the makings of a goatee. "I just made some incredibly bad decisions, decisions that hurt so many people close to me."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Aftershocks rattle US-Mexico border after 7.2-magnitude quake kills 2 in Mexico\par \par \uc2 MEXICALI, Mexico (AP) -- Aftershocks rattled the southwest Mexico-U.S. border on Monday morning in the aftermath of a major earthquake that killed two people, blacked out cities and forced the evacuation of hospitals and nursing homes.\par \par \uc2 Sunday's 7.2-magnitude quake, centered just south of the U.S. border near Mexicali, was one of the strongest earthquakes to hit region in decades, shaking at least 20 million people.\par \par \uc2 It had a shallow depth of 6 miles (10 kilometers). But the human toll was minimal in large part because the energy from the quake moved northwest of Mexicali toward a less populated area, said Jessica Sigala, a geophysicist from the U.S. Geological Survey.\par \par \uc2 "We were just kind of lucky that the energy went the other way," Sigala said. "With every earthquake, the earth starts moving a certain direction. It started south of Mexicali and the rupture moved northwest."\par \par \uc2 Building construction has also improved in northern Mexico, a region with a history of quakes, said Carlos Valdes, chief of the Mexican National Seismological Service.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Taliban stage bomb-and-grenade attack on US consulate in NW Pakistan; separate strike kills 45\par \par \uc2 PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) -- Islamist militants unleashed a car bomb and grenade attack against a U.S. consulate in northwestern Pakistan on Monday, killing four people and striking back after months of American missile strikes against Taliban and al-Qaida fighters in the region.\par \par \uc2 Hours earlier, a suicide bomber killed 45 people and wounded more than 70 at a rally by a secular political party in the northwest that has supported recent Pakistani army offensives in the region close to Afghanistan, where the United States is battling a related insurgency.\par \par \uc2 The attacks follow a lull in violence since the beginning of the year, illustrating the militants' resilience.\par \par \uc2 The multi-pronged strike against the consulate in Peshawar city was the first direct assault on a U.S. mission in the country since 2006. Officials said the four attackers in two vehicles hoped to breach the heavily fortified compound and kill people inside, but they failed to do that and caused only minor damage.\par \par \uc2 They detonated their first suicide vehicle at a checkpoint some 20 meters (yards) from the entrance to the consulate, said Peshawar police chief Liaquat Ali Khan. The second vehicle, which was carrying a larger amount of explosives, was stopped at another security barrier some 15 meters (yards) from the entrance, he said.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Catholic priest charged with assaulting 14-year-old girl in Minnesota still working in India\par \par \uc2 ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Top officials at the Vatican were warned more than four years ago about a Catholic priest later charged with sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl in Minnesota, according to newly released Vatican correspondence, but to this day he continues to work in his home diocese in India.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors in Minnesota said Monday they are trying to extradite the Rev. Joseph Palanivel Jeyapaul. Jeyapaul denied the abuse allegations and said he has no plans to return to the United States to face the courts.\par \par \uc2 The Vatican said Monday it has cooperated with U.S. law enforcement officials working to extradite Jeyapaul. In a statement to The Associated Press, Vatican attorney Jeffrey Lena said the Holy See handed over the priest's address in India. He said the Vatican had recommended Jeyapaul be defrocked, because it believed the charges were serious enough, but that his local bishop in India refused.\par \par \uc2 The bishop, the Most Rev. A. Almaraj of the diocese of Ootacamund, said he had disciplined Jeyapaul by sending him to a monastery for prayer.\par \par \uc2 Jeyapaul was charged in Minnesota in 2007, more than a year after he returned to India. Officials in the Diocese of Crookston, Minnesota, had told him to stay there after allegations against him first surfaced.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Lawyers for Ohio Christian convert teen say Muslim parents block efforts for her to stay in US\par \par \uc2 COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- A teenage girl who converted to Christianity and ran away from home is being blocked by her Muslim parents from fighting the possibility of deportation, her attorney told a judge Monday in an ongoing custody dispute.\par \par \uc2 Rifqa Bary, 17, who fled home last year and stayed with a Florida minister whom she met on \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  and does not want to be returned to her native Sri Lanka because she fears being harmed or killed by Muslim extremists.\par \par \uc2 Her attorney, Angela Lloyd, asked a judge to sign an order stating that reunification with her parents is not possible by her 18th birthday in August.\par \par \uc2 The order would allow Bary, who is in foster care, to apply for special immigration status without her parents' consent.\par \par \uc2 Omar Tarazi, an attorney for the parents, objected, telling the judge that he had been unaware of this latest maneuver by Bary's attorney to apply to an immigration court. He said the parents previously filed an immigration application for the whole family.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Study shows age does provide added wisdom in dealing with social conflict\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) -- It turns out grandma was right: Listen to your elders. New research indicates they are indeed wise -- in knowing how to deal with conflicts and accepting life's uncertainties and change.\par \par \uc2 It isn't a question of how many facts someone knows, or being able to operate a TV remote, but rather how to handle disagreements -- social wisdom.\par \par \uc2 And researchers led by Richard E. Nisbett of the University of Michigan found that older people were more likely than younger or middle-aged ones to recognize that values differ, to acknowledge uncertainties, to accept that things change over time and to acknowledge others' points of view.\par \par \uc2 "Age effects on wisdom hold at every level of social class, education, and IQ," they report in Tuesday's edition of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\par \par \uc2 In modern America, older people generally don't have greater knowledge about computers and other technology, Nisbett acknowledged, "but our results do indicate that the elderly have some advantages for analysis of social problems."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Arizona Sheriff Arpaio has inmates pedal bicycles to generate power for TV viewing\par \par \uc2 PHOENIX (AP) -- Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio has started a program he calls "Pedal Vision," in which inmates pedal stationary bikes to generate electricity for television sets. The bikes are customized to turn on connected TV sets once inmates at Phoenix's Tent City Jail pedal enough to generate 12 volts of electricity. An hour of pedaling equals an hour of television.\par \par \uc2 Arpaio said inmates only will be able to watch television if they choose to pedal.\par \par \uc2 He said he started the program with female inmates because they seemed more receptive.\par \par \uc2 Arpaio said the only exercise female inmates have been getting is speed-walking around the tent yard.\par \par \uc2 He said Pedal Vision gives them a reason to get moving and a way to burn calories.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 David Wright backs Johan Santana with homer as New York Mets beat Florida Marlins 7-1\par \par \uc2 NEW YORK (AP) -- David Wright, Johan Santana, Jason Bay. Each of them delivered. This was exactly what the New York Mets were looking for on opening day. Wright hit a two-run homer, Santana pitched six effective innings and the Mets finally solved Josh Johnson, beating the Florida Marlins 7-1 on Monday.\par \par \uc2 Newcomers Bay, Rod Barajas and Gary Matthews Jr. each got two hits for New York, which improved to a major league-best 32-17 (.653) on opening day. Manager Jerry Manuel also got three scoreless innings from his beleaguered bullpen, which he said was his biggest concern entering the season.\par \par \uc2 For one game, at least, the Mets looked ready to bounce back after they stumbled to a fourth-place finish in the NL East last year.\par \par \uc2 Manager Fredi Gonzalez and the Marlins think they can surprise the experts again this season and contend for a playoff spot, but this sloppy performance wasn't a very good beginning.\par \par \uc2 Johnson allowed four runs and five hits over five-plus innings in his first opening-day start, dropping to 7-1 with a 2.69 ERA in 10 career starts against New York.

The proposed fine, announced Monday by Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, is the most the government could levy for the sticking gas pedals that have led Toyota to recall millions of vehicles. There could be further penalties under continuing federal investigations. The Japanese automaker faces private lawsuits seeking many millions more.\par \par \uc2 Lawmakers: Afghan leader threatens to join Taliban\par \par \uc2 KABUL (AP) -- Afghan President Hamid Karzai threatened over the weekend to quit the political process and join the Taliban if he continued to come under outside pressure to reform, several members of parliament said Monday. Karzai made the unusual statement at a closed-door meeting Saturday with selected lawmakers -- just days after kicking up a diplomatic controversy with remarks alleging foreigners were behind fraud in last year's disputed elections.\par \par \uc2 6 dead, 21 missing in W. Va. coal mine blast\par \par \uc2 MONTCOAL, W.Va. (AP) -- Six miners were killed and at least 21 unaccounted for Monday in an explosion at an underground coal mine, the state mining director said. Ron Wooten said the blast was reported around 3 p.m. at \uc2 Massey Energy Co\uc2 .'s Upper Big Branch mine in Raleigh County, about 30 miles south of Charleston. The company did not provide details on the extent of the damage or if other miners had been rescued. A Boone County ambulance dispatcher also said he has the same number of fatalities and missing miners.\par \par \uc2 Tiger says he's coming back to win at Augusta\par \par \uc2 AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- While acknowledging he made some "incredibly poor decisions" in his personal life, Tiger Woods still thinks he can win the Masters -- even coming back from a five-month layoff. "Nothing's changed," Woods said Monday during an extraordinary 35-minute news conference at Augusta National. "I'm going to go out there and try to win this thing."\par \par \uc2 AP source confirms video of Baghdad firefight\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) -- A gritty war video circulating on the Internet that shows U.S. troops firing repeatedly on a group of men -- some of whom were unarmed -- walking down a Baghdad street is authentic, a senior U.S. military official confirmed Monday. The official said the video posted at Wikileaks.org was of a July 12, 2007, firefight involving Army helicopters in the New Baghdad District of eastern Baghdad.\par \par \uc2 Priest accused of US abuse still working in India\par \par \uc2 ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- A Roman Catholic priest was in his native India in 2007 when he was charged with sexually assaulting a teenage girl at his former post in Minnesota. Three years later, he is still serving as a priest in India with the blessing of his local bishop. And the Rev. Joseph Palanivel Jeyapaul has no intention of returning to the U.S. to answer the charges.\par \par \uc2 Ohio Christian convert fights to stay in US\par \par \uc2 COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- A teenage girl who converted to Christianity and ran away from home is being blocked by her Muslim parents from fighting the possibility of deportation, her attorney told a judge Monday in an ongoing custody dispute. Rifqa Bary, 17, who fled home last year and stayed with a Florida minister whom she met on \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  and does not want to be returned to her native Sri Lanka because she fears being harmed or killed by Muslim extremists.\par \par \uc2 In social dealings, being older is being wiser\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) -- It turns out grandma was right: Listen to your elders. New research indicates they are indeed wise -- in knowing how to deal with conflicts and accepting life's uncertainties and change. It isn't a question of how many facts someone knows, or being able to operate a TV remote, but rather how to handle disagreements -- social wisdom.\par \par \uc2 Sheriff Arpaio makes inmates pedal to watch TV\par \par \uc2 PHOENIX (AP) -- Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio has started a program he calls "Pedal Vision," in which inmates pedal stationary bikes to generate electricity for television sets. The bikes are customized to turn on connected TV sets once inmates at Phoenix's Tent City Jail pedal enough to generate 12 volts of electricity. An hour of pedaling equals an hour of television. Arpaio said inmates only will be able to watch television if they choose to pedal.\par \par \uc2 Heyward's 3-run homer helps Braves beat Cubs 16-5\par \par \uc2 ATLANTA (AP) -- Jason Heyward hit like The Hammer in his Atlanta Braves debut.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.  \par \par \uc2 FRESNO, Calif. (AP) - Paula Medrano shifts uncomfortably on the doctor's examination table, holding out a wrist inflamed and swollen by arthritis. The 78-year-old has no health insurance, lives below the federal poverty level, and can't pay for the medication she needs.\par \par \uc2 Just days before her appointment, President Barack Obama signed, with much fanfare, a historic bill to extend health care access to 32 million currently uninsured people. But Medrano and her daughter, Juana Aguirre, barely paid attention.\par \par \uc2 "It's a great thing, but it's not for us," said Aguirre.\par \par \uc2 Medrano is an undocumented immigrant -- one of the 7 million uninsured people living in the United States who were explicitly excluded from the legislation, according to estimates by the Congressional Budget Office.\par \par \uc2 The question of whether to extend coverage to illegal immigrants was so politically contentious that, under the approved legislation, they will not even be able to buy health insurance in the newly created purchasing pools called exchanges if they pay entirely out of their own pocket.\par \par \uc2 Proponents of reducing immigration believe that allowing illegal immigrants access to health care is an incentive for them to come, and an unfair tax burden on Americans.\par \par \uc2 Although the approved legislation explicitly excludes undocumented immigrants from participating in the exchanges, there is no foolproof way of verifying their documentation to keep them out, said Yeh Ling-Ling, executive director of Alliance for a Sustainable USA.\par \par \uc2 They will also continue to have access to emergency medical assistance.\par \par \uc2 "It is not fair on struggling Americans," said Yeh.\par \par \uc2 What is clear is that as the ranks of the uninsured diminish, immigrants like Medrano will continue to patch together health care as they can -- at health centers such as Fresno's Clinica Sierra Vista, at hospital emergency rooms, or through programs like Healthy San Francisco, which offers universal health care to all who live in the city.\par \par \uc2 "We have to be very creative -- not asking for labs unless it's really essential, working with generics, working with drug companies, giving them samples," said Juan Carlos Ruvalcaba, the doctor seeing Medrano at Clinica, which charges on a sliding scale of $40 to $70, depending on the patient's ability to pay.\par \par \uc2 Once an undocumented immigrant himself, Ruvalcaba was able to become a citizen and attend medical school because of an amnesty program in 1986. He remains committed to serving all patients, no matter their insurance or immigration status, but there is only so much he can do, he said.\par \par \uc2 He was able to give Medrano the drugs she needed, but he asked, "What happens when they need a specialist? What if they end up in the emergency room, and end up with a big bill?"\par \par \uc2 Some who work with this population are afraid that with the focus shifting onto providing care for the newly insured, those shut out of the system will be forgotten, left to fend for themselves with even fewer resources.\par \par \uc2 "It may make things worse -- if you say 32 million are covered, there may be less done for these large groups who are here, who are working, who are such a large part of our agriculture industry," said Norma Forbes, executive director of Fresno Healthy Communities Access Partners, a nonprofit network of eleven health care organizations in California's rural Central Valley.\par \par \uc2 Illegal immigrant\uc2  won't be the only uninsured left: about 16 million Americans are estimated to remain outside the health care system even after access is expanded over the next few years, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\par \par \uc2 This includes those who opt out, who don't know how to enroll, or who are exempted from the health insurance requirement because they can't afford the premiums, even with a subsidy.\par \par \uc2 For these patients, there will indeed be fewer options as doctors, hospitals and other providers increase their caseload to take in new patients bearing insurance, said Dan Hawkins, who is charged with policy and research at the National Association of Community Health Centers.\par \par \uc2 "There will be greater concentration of care for the uninsured in fewer places," Hawkins said.\par \par \uc2 Community health centers, the lynchpin of the safety net system now caring for the medically underserved, whether they are immigrants or citizens, will remain one of the places where people like Medrano will be able to see a doctor at an affordable cost.\par \par \uc2 Federally qualified clinics got a substantial funding boost through the health reform package.\par \par \uc2 They will get $11 billion in new funding over the next five years, which will allow them to double the number of patients they see, from 20 million a year now to 40 million people a year by 2015.\par \par \uc2 Most of these new patients will come bearing new insurance cards, or be part of the larger pool qualifying for Medicaid. But among them will be illegal immigrants, said Hawkins.\par \par \uc2 "Health centers will continue to be open to everyone regardless of their ability to pay, undocumented immigrants and everyone else," he said. "We don't know how many of the uninsured we serve right now are undocumented. But we do know a health center is a better, and less expensive, place for them to get that care."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100404e644003h6\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 LAREDO, Texas (AP) - A Border Patrol agent shot and killed an unarmed man on the banks of the Rio Grande following a struggle, authorities said Friday.\par \par \uc2 Border Patrol agents found several men carrying five bundles of marijuana, weighing about 260 pounds, onto the river bank in Laredo near a residential neighborhood late Wednesday night, said Laredo police spokesman Joe Baeza Jr.\par \par \uc2 The men scattered when the agents approached. An agent caught up with one of the alleged smugglers, and the pair struggled in the brush before the agent shot the man once in the chest, Baeza said.\par \par \uc2 "The paramedics tried to revive him, but he was already gone," he said.\par \par \uc2 Investigators do not believe the man, a Mexican citizen in his 30s, was armed, Baeza said.\par \par \uc2 Border Patrol officials confirmed the shooting but would not release other details on Friday including any information about the agent or to say whether he was still on patrol.\par \par \uc2 Authorities are working with the Mexican consulate to notify the man's family before releasing his name, but he is believed to have previously been apprehended by Border Patrol while allegedly trafficking drugs into the United States, Baeza said.\par \par \uc2 The other men who allegedly crossed the Rio Grande Wednesday night escaped by swimming back across the river into Mexico, he said.\par \par \uc2 While Border Patrol agents occasionally get into physical confrontations with illegal immigrants, shootings remain very rare.\par \par \uc2 Two agents, Ignacio Ramos and Jose Compean, shot an unarmed \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , Osvaldo Aldrete Davila, in 2005 near El Paso. Aldrete later said he was trying to surrender, though the agents claimed Aldrete was brandishing a gun.\par \par \uc2 The agents were convicted in federal court of assault with a dangerous weapon, lying about the incident and violating Aldrete's constitutional rights. Aldrete was later arrested on drug trafficking charges, and the agent's case became a contested part of the debate on border security.\par \par \uc2 Ramos and Compean went to prison but had their sentences commuted by President George W. Bush in early 2009.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100402e64200397\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

Aldrete later said he was trying to surrender, though the agents claimed Aldrete was brandishing a gun.\par \par \uc2 The agents were convicted in federal court of assault with a dangerous weapon, lying about the incident and violating Aldrete's constitutional rights. Aldrete was later arrested on drug trafficking charges, and the agent's case became a hotly contested part of the debate on border security.\par \par \uc2 Ramos and Compean went to prison but had their sentences commuted by President Bush in 2009.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100402e6420033f\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SAN DIEGO (AP) - Two immigrants were freed Wednesday from federal detention centers, years after judges put their cases on hold due to serious questions about their mental competence.\par \par \uc2 Attorneys who filed petitions for the release of Guillermo Gomez Sanchez, 48, and Jose Antonio Franco Gonzalez, 29, said the cases exposed a "black hole" that allows authorities to hold mentally ill immigrants for years without having to explain themselves to a judge or anyone else.\par \par \uc2 The attorneys suspected many other mentally ill detainees were being held under similar circumstances.\par \par \uc2 "There are no safeguards," said Judy London of Public Counsel, a nonprofit group that sought Franco's release along with the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California. "These cases are put on indefinite hold, and you have no accounting."\par \par \uc2 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement issued a one-sentence statement on its decision to release the detainees from San Diego's Otay Mesa detention center.\par \par \uc2 "After a review of their custody status, medical conditions and assurances from their families, we believe their release from ICE custody is appropriate," it read.\par \par \uc2 Agency spokeswoman Lauren Mack declined to elaborate, citing pending litigation.\par \par \uc2 An immigration judge put Gomez's case on hold in January 2006 and ordered ICE to evaluate his mental competence, according to a legal petition filed in federal court in San Diego by the ACLU of San Diego and Imperial Counties and the Casa Cornelia Law Center.\par \par \uc2 ICE didn't evaluate Gomez until February 2007 and didn't put his case back on the court docket until June 2008, the petition said.\par \par \uc2 In 2009, a judge ordered him released on a $5,000 bond, ruling he was not a flight risk or a danger to the community. However, government attorneys challenged the order.\par \par \uc2 Gomez, a legal resident from Mexico, had several brushes with the law, including a conviction in 2004 for assault with a deadly weapon that prompted the deportation proceedings.\par \par \uc2 An immigration judge put Franco's case on hold in June 2005, citing mental incompetence. The ACLU said he has the mental age of a child, doesn't know his age or birthday, has trouble counting and cannot tell time.\par \par \uc2 The government didn't put Franco's case back on the docket until December 2009, according to the petition. Franco, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Mexico, served one year in jail for assault with a deadly weapon after authorities alleged he threw a rock during a fight between two rival gangs in 2004.\par \par \uc2 The cases highlight the need to protect detainees whose mental illnesses prevent them from advocating for themselves, said Ahilan Arulanantham, director of immigrant rights and national security for the ACLU of Southern California. He urged ICE to conduct a review to determine if other mentally ill detainees have also been locked up for years while their cases are on hold.\par \par \uc2 "There's no continuance, there's not a motion, there's nothing, it just stops," he said. "The reason why that's happening is there are no procedures."\par \par \uc2 Gomez will stay with family in San Bernardino, east of Los Angeles. Franco was released to family in Costa Mesa.\par \par \uc2 Ruben Franco, 38, said his younger brother was enjoying a home-cooked meal and watching music videos at home Wednesday. He said the family didn't hire a lawyer for years because they were unsure they would succeed.\par \par \uc2 The attorneys who filed the petition last week didn't begin to work on the case until a few months ago, Ruben Franco said. They worked for free.\par \par \uc2 "We didn't know what was going on, just that they wouldn't release him," he said.\par \par \uc2 It is unknown how many of the approximately 30,000 federal immigration detainees nationwide have mental illnesses because ICE doesn't track that figure, ICE spokeswoman Virginia Kice has said.\par \par \uc2 However, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano announced a series of proposed reforms last year that included devising a medical classification system for detainees with unique medical or mental health needs.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Jablon reported from Los Angeles.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100401e64100068\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

Richardson orders National Guard to patrol Mexico border after Ariz. rancher's death\b0\par\par\uc2 By SUE MAJOR HOLMES   \par \uc2 Associated Press Writer\par \uc2 362 \uc2 words\par \uc2 31 March 2010\par 16:55\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2010.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) - The New Mexico National Guard is planning how to put more troops along the state's border with Mexico to beef up surveillance after Gov. Bill Richardson on Wednesday ordered guardsmen to patrol the area.\par \par \uc2 The order came days after an Arizona rancher was shot to death. Authorities believe he was killed last weekend by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who fled to Mexico.\par \par \uc2 Details are being worked out for how many troops will be sent to the border and where they will be based.\par \par \uc2 A spokesman for the New Mexico Guard, Lt. Col. Jamison Herrera, said the timeframe and scope of the operation will determine how many soldiers will be activated.\par \par \uc2 Their focus will be observation posts and using infrared tools that can detect body heat and movement during the night, he said.\par \par \uc2 A spokesman for Richardson, Gilbert Gallegos, said troops will not be apprehending immigrants.\par \par \uc2 In 2005, then-President George W. Bush ordered 6,000 National Guard troops to New Mexico, Arizona, Texas and California to help the Border Patrol cut illegal immigration. Troops were deployed in observation posts along the border until Border Patrol ranks were beefed up.\par \par \uc2 Last August, the four border governors asked congressional leaders to fully fund a long-standing program in which National Guard troops help with anti-drug efforts at the U.S.-Mexico border. They told House and Senate leaders additional manpower was needed as violence associated with drug trafficking intensified.\par \par \uc2 On Tuesday, Richardson's office said state police and county sheriff's departments have increased patrols along the border and that the U.S. Border Patrol also has boosted its presence.\par \par \uc2 The guardsmen will work with the state Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management, which is coordinating law enforcement along the border.\par \par \uc2 Also this week, members of New Mexico's congressional delegation asked Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano to increase the Border Patrol's presence in the Boot Heel of New Mexico, which is about 10 miles from the spot where the Arizona rancher was killed.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100331e63v002gf\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

He was out checking water line and fencing on the land Krentz's family has ranched since 1907.\par \par \uc2 Cochise County authorities believe Krentz was killed by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who then fled to Mexico. Foot tracks were identified and followed approximately 20 miles south to the Mexico border by county, state and federal authorities.\par \par \uc2 In addition to announcing the reward money Tuesday, Cattle Growers' Association officials say a memorial fund has been set up at Wells Fargo Bank to help Krentz's family.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100331e63v0009v\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHOENIX (AP) - A prominent southeast Arizona rancher likely was killed by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , but there's no evidence to suggest there was any confrontation that led to the shooting, authorities said Monday.\par \par \uc2 The body of Robert Krentz, 58, was located before midnight Saturday on his 35,000-acre ranch about 35 miles northeast of Douglas after his brother reported that he had lost radio contact with Krentz earlier in the day.\par \par \uc2 At a news conference Monday, Cochise County Sheriff Larry Dever said Krentz was out checking water line and fencing on the land Krentz's family has ranched since 1907. Krentz had weapons with him in his all-terrain vehicle but didn't use them, according to Dever.\par \par \uc2 Investigators said Krentz apparently came upon one person when he was shot. Krentz was heard telling his brother "illegal alien" on the radio earlier Saturday, and the area of the slaying is a known smuggling corridor, according to authorities.\par \par \uc2 While Krentz was still in his vehicle, mortally wounded, he managed to drive the ATV away from the scene at a high rate of speed before becoming unconscious. The ATV still had its lights on and the engine running when authorities found it.\par \par \uc2 Foot tracks were identified and followed approximately 20 miles south to the Mexico border by sheriff's deputies, U.S. Border Patrol trackers and Department of Corrections dog chase teams, authorities said.\par \par \uc2 The sheriff's office said Krentz's body was transported to the Cochise County Medical Examiner's Office for an autopsy to determine approximate time of death.\par \par \uc2 So far, there have been no suspects identified and no arrests.\par \par \uc2 "We are assuming he escaped south into Mexico," Dever said of the shooter.\par \par \uc2 Dever told a Tucson newspaper that while investigators don't have a motive yet, retaliation has been raised as a possibility. The day before the shooting, the victim's brother, Phil Krentz, reported drug smuggling activity on the ranch to the Border Patrol.\par \par \uc2 Agents found 290 pounds of marijuana on the ranch and followed tracks to where they found and arrested eight illegal immigrants. All were still in custody when the shooting occurred, the Arizona Daily Star reported.\par \par \uc2 U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., whose Congressional district covers the area, issued a statement saying Krentz's killing is a horrible tragedy that deserves a swift and strong response.\par \par \uc2 "The cold-blooded killing of an Arizona rancher is a sad and sobering reminder of the threats to public safety that exist in our border communities," Giffords said. "It has not yet been determined who committed this atrocity or why, but I know that federal and local authorities are mobilizing every possible resource to locate and apprehend the assailant."\par \par \uc2 Giffords said if Krentz's killing is connected to drug cartels or smugglers, the federal government must respond appropriately.\par \par \uc2 "All options should be on the table, including sending more Border Patrol agents to the area and deploying the National Guard," Giffords said.\par \par \uc2 Arizona Attorney General Terry Goddard said government has a clear responsibility to aid law enforcement resources at all levels along the border.\par \par \uc2 "I call on our federal and state governments to work together to bolster the law enforcement resources needed to better protect Arizonans living on the border," Goddard said.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer joined U.S. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., in calling for federal officials to send more National Guard troops to the Mexican border.\par \par \uc2 "The federal government must do all it can within its power to curb this violence and protect its citizens from criminals coming across the border from Mexico," McCain wrote in a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, a former Arizona governor.\par \par \uc2 U.S. Sens. Jeff Bingaman and Tom Udall of New Mexico, along with Rep.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHOENIX (AP) - A prominent southeast Arizona rancher likely was killed by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , but there's no evidence to suggest there was any confrontation that led to the shooting, authorities said Monday.\par \par \uc2 The body of Robert Krentz, 58, was located before midnight Saturday on his 35,000-acre ranch about 35 miles northeast of Douglas after his brother reported that he had lost radio contact with Krentz earlier in the day.\par \par \uc2 At a news conference Monday, Cochise County Sheriff Larry Dever said Krentz was out checking water line and fencing on the land Krentz's family has ranched since 1907. Krentz had weapons with him in his all-terrain vehicle but didn't use them, according to Dever.\par \par \uc2 Investigators said Krentz apparently came upon one person when he was shot. Krentz was heard telling his brother "illegal alien" on the radio earlier Saturday, and the area of the slaying is a known smuggling corridor, according to authorities.\par \par \uc2 While Krentz was still in his vehicle, mortally wounded, he managed to drive the ATV away from the scene at a high rate of speed before becoming unconscious. The ATV still had its lights on and the engine running when authorities found it.\par \par \uc2 Foot tracks were identified and followed approximately 20 miles south to the Mexico border by sheriff's deputies, U.S. Border Patrol trackers and Department of Corrections dog chase teams, authorities said.\par \par \uc2 So far, there have been no suspects identified and no arrests.\par \par \uc2 "We are assuming he escaped south into Mexico," Dever said of the shooter.\par \par \uc2 Dever told a Tucson newspaper that while investigators don't have a motive yet, retaliation has been raised as a possibility. The day before the shooting, the victim's brother, Phil Krentz, reported drug smuggling activity on the ranch to the Border Patrol.\par \par \uc2 Agents found 290 pounds of marijuana on the ranch and followed tracks to where they found and arrested eight illegal immigrants. All were still in custody when the shooting occurred, the Arizona Daily Star reported.\par \par \uc2 U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., whose Congressional district covers the area, issued a statement saying Krentz's killing is a horrible tragedy that deserves a swift and strong response.\par \par \uc2 "The cold-blooded killing of an Arizona rancher is a sad and sobering reminder of the threats to public safety that exist in our border communities," Giffords said. "It has not yet been determined who committed this atrocity or why, but I know that federal and local authorities are mobilizing every possible resource to locate and apprehend the assailant."\par \par \uc2 Giffords said if Krentz's killing is connected to drug cartels or smugglers, the federal government must respond appropriately.\par \par \uc2 "All options should be on the table, including sending more Border Patrol agents to the area and deploying the National Guard," Giffords said.\par \par \uc2 Arizona Attorney General Terry Goddard said government has a clear responsibility to aid law enforcement resources at all levels along the border.\par \par \uc2 "I call on our federal and state governments to work together to bolster the law enforcement resources needed to better protect Arizonans living on the border," Goddard said.\par \par \uc2 The sheriff's office said Krentz's body was transported to the Cochise County Medical Examiner's Office for an autopsy to determine approximate time of death.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, three members of New Mexico's congressional delegation are asking Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano to increase the Border Patrol's presence in the Boot Heel of New Mexico.\par \par \uc2 U.S. Sens. Jeff Bingaman and Tom Udall, along with Rep. Harry Teague, said Napolitano's agency needs to take more security steps.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100329e63t000xd\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.    \par \par \uc2 OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) - A state lawmaker last year quietly opened up confidential state employee information to a private labor organization that advocates for state workers.\par \par \uc2 The Oklahoma Public Employees Association can now send annual mailings to the home addresses of all state workers -- addresses the Legislature closed off to the public years ago by exempting them from the state's Open Records Act.\par \par \uc2 The special access to the information was made possible by Rep. Randy Terrill, R-Moore, who is also an OPEA member.\par \par \uc2 Terrill has won the group's support again this year because he is the House author of Senate Bill 1753, which would exempt dates of birth of public employees from the Open Records Act.\par \par \uc2 Since House Bill 2245 went into effect in June, a spreadsheet of all state workers' home addresses has twice been e-mailed to direct mail companies hired by OPEA, according to Office of State Finance contracts and e-mails obtained by The Oklahoman.\par \par \uc2 The confidentiality agreements call for written confirmation that the mailing list has been destroyed within five days of the mailing. The Office of State Finance has no record of those written confirmations. Jim McGoodwin, deputy director, said he received verbal confirmation. A representative of the direct mail company said it was never asked to provide written confirmation.\par \par \uc2 The association has used the addresses for direct mail campaigns urging state employees to join OPEA, which has about 10,000 members out of 40,000 state employees.\par \par \uc2 For his work to provide the state employee mailing list to the association, OPEA named Terrill its "Legislator of the Year" for the 2009 year.\par \par \uc2 "Representative Terrill has shown himself to be a friend of state employees and OPEA by passing HB 2245," said Connie Stockton, the group's president, in a news release announcing Terrill's honor.\par \par \uc2 "That bill gives state employees a great tool for getting organized and growing our association. For the first time in our 34-year history, OPEA will be able to contact every state employee once per year and ask them to join with us in giving state employees a much stronger voice at the Capitol."\par \par \uc2 OPEA Deputy Director Scott Barger said the mailing list access is just another tool used by the association for recruitment. The association has had a similar mailing list arrangement since 2004 to reach retired state employees from the Oklahoma Public Employees Retirement System.\par \par \uc2 Last year's broader mailing list access was tacked on in the closing days of the legislative session to a bill outlining how state prisons should deal with \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  detainees. The bill was called the Oklahoma Criminal Illegal Alien Repatriation Act of 2009.\par \par \uc2 The mailing list section was added to HB 2245 in a conference committee report May 21. OPEA is the only organization that has used the new law to conduct mailings, according to Office of State Finance records. The group is not charged for the list.\par \par \uc2 The new law applies to organizations limited to state employee membership that include more than 2,000 state employees as members.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Information from: The Oklahoman, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.newsok.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.newsok.com}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020100328e63s004dd\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHOENIX (AP) - A raid targeting illegal immigration led to the arrests of 21 Phoenix-area \uc2 McDonald's\uc2  workers Friday, and authorities were still seeking 30 other employees as part of their investigation.\par \par \uc2 Those arrested during the raid of four \uc2 McDonald's\uc2  in Scottsdale, Tempe and Mesa were being held on suspicion of identity theft. It will take more time to determine whether any of them are illegal immigrants as officials suspect, said Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio.\par \par \uc2 Deputies also searched a mansion in the tony Phoenix suburb of Paradise Valley owned by Richard Coulston, who owns the restaurants, Arpaio said. Coulston was not arrested.\par \par \uc2 Deputies could be seen on local television stations swarming around Coulston's mansion, and \uc2 McDonald's\uc2  workers were shown crying and hugging each other.\par \par \uc2 It's a shame that Friday's arrests had to happen at the fast-food restaurant, which is "more than just a business," Arpaio said.\par \par \uc2 "It's an American institution," he said, adding, "a place that my kids and yours could always count on for their first job ever. That these \uc2 McDonald's\uc2  restaurants targeted in today's investigation are giving jobs away to people using false IDs or perhaps working here illegally is a shame."\par \par \uc2 McDonald's Corp\uc2 . referred comment to Coulston's company, R&L Management.\par \par \uc2 In a statement, attorney Julie Pace -- acting as a company spokeswoman -- said people shouldn't jump to conclusions without all the facts.\par \par \uc2 "The company has trained its managers and hiring personnel regarding proper hiring procedures," said Pace, one of several lawyers representing business groups that have unsuccessfully tried to overturn the state's employer sanctions law. "Any individuals unable to meet the legal requirements for establishing authorization to work are not hired."\par \par \uc2 Pace said the company was cooperating with the sheriff's office.\par \par \uc2 Arpaio said deputies were tipped off in November to the \uc2 McDonald's\uc2  they raided by a caller to their illegal immigration hot line, and the tipster alleged several employees bragged about being illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Deputies used government databases to identify 51 workers who appear to be illegal workers, and were looking for the 30 outstanding suspects.\par \par \uc2 County officials said if any of the workers turns out to be an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , it could be their fourth civil case under the employer sanctions law, which penalizes employers for knowingly hiring illegal immigrants. The law, which is more than two years old, carries license suspensions and revocations for those who knowingly make illegal hires and is designed to reduce the economic incentive for immigrants to cross the border.\par \par \uc2 Authorities across Arizona have examined several dozen complaints of employer sanctions violations. But no business licenses have been revoked and only three civil cases have been filed -- against a Subway sandwich franchise in west Phoenix, a now-defunct northwest Phoenix amusement park and a custom furniture maker in Scottsdale.\par \par \uc2 Danny's Subway and the amusement park, Waterworld, acknowledged violating the employer sanctions law and settled their cases with the county. The case against the furniture store is ongoing.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press Writer Mark Carlson contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document
