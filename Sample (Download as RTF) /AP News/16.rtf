The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (AP) - A federal program that seeks to identify and expel illegal immigrants with criminal records from the country has led to the deportation of just five people from the four South Dakota counties taking part since the program's rollout in late June.\par \par \uc2 The Secure Communities Initiative asks jailers to send the fingerprints of every new inmate through a federal database to quickly identify illegal immigrants most likely to pose a danger to the community.\par \par \uc2 Minnehaha, Pennington, Custer Fall River and Jackson counties are taking part in the program.\par \par \uc2 The Argus Leader reported Sunday that the five people deported from South Dakota were among 3,127 immigrants removed from the Dakotas, Iowa and Nebraska this year.\par \par \uc2 Of the almost 4,500 sets of prints scanned in South Dakota, only 12 prompted action by a response from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Not every crime is a deportable offense under federal law.\par \par \uc2 Minnehaha County Sheriff Mike Milstead said deportations never were meant to be the measure of the program's success. Rather, it's a way to improve communication between agencies dealing with a problem that has grown larger than the laws written to deal with it, he said.\par \par \uc2 "Whether it's one or it's 100, the key is that there's a mechanism in place to link us together," Milstead said. "I think many Americans realize that our current laws and current enforcement are marginal at best."\par \par \uc2 Before Secure Communities, new prints were checked only against the FBI's criminal database. Now, the prints go there and to the Department of Homeland Security, ICE's parent agency.\par \par \uc2 Immigration officers get a notice every time the system detects a previously-convicted criminal or possible \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . It's up to ICE to decide what to do after that. The agency does not and cannot pursue everyone, ICE spokesman Shawn Neudauer said.\par \par \uc2 Some conservative South Dakota lawmakers say they believe the return from the ICE program is small and indicates that the federal government's strategies are ineffective. They say a set of Arizona-style state laws punishing illegal immigrants and anyone who offers them a job, a home or transportation could force federal lawmakers to enact stricter immigration measures.\par \par \uc2 Others see the numbers as a sign that South Dakota's immigration issues aren't pressing enough for a law that could fill state jails with international offenders and draw costly legal challenges. Victims' advocates fear that programs such as Secure Communities and laws such as Arizona's lead to distrust between law enforcement and minorities.\par \par \uc2 U.S. Attorney Brendan Johnson has experienced prosecutors who handle felony cases of illegal reentry after deportation, most of which originate through ICE investigations.\par \par \uc2 They amount to 15 to 18 percent of the office's caseload and often are open-and-shut cases, Johnson said.\par \par \uc2 "These cases are not very time-consuming," Johnson said. "We have plenty of resources that have been allocated to us."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Information from: Argus Leader, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.argusleader.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.argusleader.com}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101129e6bt00230\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc8}{\*\bkmkend toc8}\b \uc2 In the state of Reagan and Nixon, Republicans ponder a dismal future after November's rout\b0\par\par\uc2 By MICHAEL R. BLOOD   \par \uc2 AP Political Writer\par \uc2 1,131 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 November 2010\par 16:11\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2010.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 LOS ANGELES (AP) - Republicans are relishing the coming of a new day on Capitol Hill. But across the country in California, the party of Nixon and Reagan is drifting toward obscurity.\par \par \uc2 The latest sign of imperiled health: In a year Republicans notched big victories in Congress, governor's offices and statehouses around the nation, California Democrats made a clean sweep of eight statewide contests on Nov. 2. Democrats padded their majority in the Legislature, where the party controls both chambers and no congressional seats changed parties.\par \par \uc2 California counted more registered Republicans in 1988 than it does today, even though the state population has since grown by about 10 million. Setting aside the politically ambidextrous Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, whose celebrity eclipsed his Republican registration, the California GOP counts only a single victory in 21 statewide contests since 2002 -- that of insurance commissioner in 2006.\par \par \uc2 You'd have to go back more than two decades to find a Republican, George H.W. Bush, who carried the state in a presidential election.\par \par \uc2 "They know who we are and they don't like us," former state Republican Party Chairman Duf Sundheim says bluntly. "The brand of the Republican Party in California is tarnished."\par \par \uc2 With the U.S. House majority in hand and an eye toward 2012, Republicans in Washington have staked out plans for tax cuts and undercutting President Barack Obama's health care reforms. The situation in California presents a reverse image, where Republican influence has been marginalized. Voters this month cleared the Legislature to pass budgets with a majority vote -- down from a two-thirds threshold -- that will allow Democrats to pass a spending plan without Republican support.\par \par \uc2 The GOP losses this month left party leaders stunned. Recession-weary voters seemingly wanted new faces and ideas. The Democratic political careerists, Sen. Barbara Boxer and state Attorney General Jerry Brown, a former two-term governor, both were considered vulnerable, facing well-funded candidates.\par \par \uc2 In the end, Brown easily claimed the governor's chair from Republican billionaire Meg Whitman, a former \uc2 eBay\uc2  chief executive who spent more money -- at least $174 million -- than any candidate for a statewide office in U.S. history. All but roughly $30 million of that was from her personal fortune.\par \par \uc2 Boxer beat former \uc2 Hewlett-Packard Co\uc2 . chief executive Carly Fiorina, another Republican, by nearly 10 points. What was supposed to be a vaunted GOP get-out-the-vote effort fizzled.\par \par \uc2 For now, the conservative tilt in Washington and tea party activism will do Republicans little good in statewide races in California, where voters show a preference for candidates who support abortion rights and embrace environmental regulation.\par \par \uc2 But the GOP's biggest problem rests with the surging number of Latinos, who typically vote Democratic, a tendency hardened by the debate over illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 It's been said the future happens first in California, and the state hit a little-noticed milestone this month that will have implications in voting booths for years to come. For the first time, Hispanics account for more than half the students in the state's public schools. They will be tomorrow's voters.\par \par \uc2 "I'm not sure Republicans have hit bottom yet in California," said former state lawmaker Jim Brulte, an influential GOP party fixture.\par \par \uc2 The plight of California Republicans has loosely tracked demographic and economic changes that have reshaped the nation's most populous state and its electorate.\par \par \uc2 In 1978, 83 percent of the state's registered voters were white. As of last year, that percentage dropped to 65 percent, according to the Field Poll. During that time, Latino registration jumped from 8 percent to 21 percent, while Asian registration increased from 3 percent to 8 percent.\par \par \uc2 The California dream, myth or not, has lured residents since the days of the Gold Rush. But in today's diversifying California "there is a strong sense with a significant percentage of the population that we don't understand that dream for them," Sundheim says.\par \par \uc2 Most of the state's governors in the 20th century were Republicans, and state voters helped elevate a string of GOP presidential candidates to the White House -- Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and the first Bush. But recent history isn't encouraging. The GOP's last serious effort to carry the state in a presidential campaign was in 2000, when George W. Bush spent more than $15 million in California and lost to Democrat Al Gore by 12 points.\par \par \uc2 Part of the problem is simple math. Both major parties have been losing registration as more voters choose to align with no party at all, but Republican registration has withered to about 31 percent, giving Democrats, at 44 percent, a 2.2 million-voter advantage. Independents -- about one in five voters -- also lean Democratic in the state.\par \par \uc2 For a Republican "the crossover vote that you need is almost unreachable," says Allan Hoffenblum, publisher of the California Target Book, an analysis of legislative and congressional races. Hoffenblum says the GOP maintains strongholds in inland regions, but Democrats dominate the populous coast.\par \par \uc2 It leaves candidates such as Whitman with little, if any, room for error. The disclosure in the run-up to Election Day that Whitman employed an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  for years as a housekeeper, then fired her after learning of her citizenship status, made her a target of ridicule in Spanish-language media. Brown carried the Hispanic vote 2-1, according to an Associated Press survey of voters leaving polling places.\par \par \uc2 Former Republican Gov. Pete Wilson says the clout of Sacramento unions has changed the political calculus. Unions spent roughly $30 million supporting Brown's candidacy, helping him survive Whitman's record spending. After this year's losses, Wilson, said Republicans must develop a clear message and deliver it persuasively.\par \par \uc2 Some analysts say state Republicans have been scalded by focusing too much on social issues, including strong opposition to abortion and gay rights, leaving swing voters cringing.\par \par \uc2 Two upcoming changes will remake California elections, but it's not clear if either major party will benefit.\par \par \uc2 The state is using an independent citizen's commission to redraw the boundaries of legislative and congressional districts, after voters stripped that power from the Legislature. California also is moving to open primary contests for congressional, legislative and statewide offices. Voters will be able to choose candidates from any party, with the top two vote-getters heading to the general election.\par \par \uc2 Schwarzenegger told California Republicans two years ago that they were in for a future of disappointment unless they shifted to the political center, seizing issues usually associated with the Democrats, including climate change and health care reform.\par \par \uc2 "We are dying at the box office," he warned.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101128e6bs003c2\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ATLANTA (AP) - Emboldened by November's electoral gains in the General Assembly, Georgia Republicans are fixing to make illegal immigration a major issue during the upcoming legislative session.\par \par \uc2 They'll have an ally in incoming GOP governor Nathan Deal, who made tough anti-illegal immigration measures a centerpiece of his time in Congress.\par \par \uc2 A committee of 14 Republican lawmakers was formed in September to study illegal immigration and to identify its impact on Georgia. The committee aims to fill any gaps in Georgia's laws and to add enforcement tools to laws already on the books, co-chair Rep. Matt Ramsey said.\par \par \uc2 There's been a lot of talk about the possibility of an Arizona-style crackdown on illegal immigration by giving local law enforcement expanded powers, but Ramsey said the committee won't just cut and paste the text of the controversial law that Arizona passed earlier this year.\par \par \uc2 "We're going to have a Georgia bill and there are probably going to be elements in that bill that were in the Arizona law, but we're also looking at some things that other states have done," Ramsey said.\par \par \uc2 A spokesman for Deal said the new governor wouldn't just sign such a law; he'll push to get it passed.\par \par \uc2 "Nathan has said throughout the course of the course of his campaign that he will advocate for an Arizona-style law in Georgia," Brian Robinson said.\par \par \uc2 Already two immigration-related bills have been "prefiled" for the legislative session, which begins in January. One deals with undocumented students in the state university system and the other with employment verification of contractors.\par \par \uc2 Neither of those bills came from members of the legislative committee, which Ramsey said will probably end up proposing two or three bills of its own.\par \par \uc2 Notably absent from the legislative committee are lawmakers from the Democratic minority. Sen. Nan Orrock, a Democrat from Atlanta, says focusing so heavily on immigration at the state level is a mistake.\par \par \uc2 "The leadership has chosen to appoint a joint committee on immigration when really what they should be having is a joint committee on job creation," she said. "None of the things they're proposing are going to create jobs in Georgia."\par \par \uc2 Instead of drafting state laws on illegal immigration, legislators should be talking to Georgia's congressional delegation to seek passage of immigration reform at the federal level. "All of this monkeying around at the state level and whipping up of anti-immigrant sentiment is ill-advised," she said.\par \par \uc2 Ramsey agreed that immigration should be dealt with at the federal level, but he and other Republicans are frustrated by federal inaction when constituents repeatedly insist the issue is of top concern.\par \par \uc2 University of Georgia political scientist Charles Bullock says it's one issue Georgians seem to care about.\par \par \uc2 "It's probably more symbolic than anything else, but it's certainly a topic that resonates with a lot of people," he said. "Is it going to have an effect that will be felt by non immigrants? Probably not. Is it going to suddenly free up a lot of jobs? I doubt it."\par \par \uc2 Rep. Tom Rice, a Republican from Norcross, has prefiled a bill that would prohibit all 35 public colleges and universities in Georgia from admitting illegal immigrants. Rice said the Board of Regents, which governs those institutions, didn't go far enough when it tightened its rules regarding \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  applicants last month.\par \par \uc2 Under the new rules, University System of Georgia schools are barred from accepting \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  applicants if they have rejected any academically qualified applicants in the two most recent academic years. That includes five Georgia colleges and universities: the University of Georgia, Georgia Tech, Georgia State University, Medical College of Georgia and Georgia College & State University.\par \par \uc2 Republican Sen. Judson Hill, of Marietta, has prefiled a legislation called the "Georgia Public Works and Contractor Protection Act," which would beef up existing laws governing verification of employee eligibility for public entities, their contractors and subcontractors.\par \par \uc2 Deal is expected to be very supportive of legislation that's tough on illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 During his Congressional career, he pushed unsuccessful legislation to end automatic U.S. citizenship for children born here to illegal immigrants. His bill failed repeatedly, but the idea has recently gained traction among some in Congress.\par \par \uc2 In 1995, he proposed using soldiers to help enforce immigration and drug laws at the border. He also proposed legislation to require all employers to use a federal database called E-Verify meant to keep illegal immigrants out of the work force.\par \par \uc2 ----------\par \par \uc2 Georgia General Assembly: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.legis.ga.gov"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.legis.ga.gov}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101127e6br0020g\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - The California Nurses Association helped the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  former housekeeper of billionaire Meg Whitman make her story public, a revelation that helped sink the gubernatorial hopes of the former \uc2 eBay\uc2  chief executive, according to a report published Tuesday in the San Francisco Chronicle.\par \par \uc2 Nicky Diaz Santillan, whose story knocked Whitman's tightly orchestrated campaign off message when she came forward in September, reached out for help from the union because she believed she was unfairly fired by Whitman, the newspaper reported, citing people who were close to the matter but would only speak if their names were not used.\par \par \uc2 Diaz Santillan contacted a friend who knew a member of the nurses union, according to the Chronicle. The union then put the Mexican-born housekeeper in touch with an immigration attorney and celebrity attorney Gloria Allred, who appeared with her at a Los Angeles news conference in September.\par \par \uc2 Diaz Santillan said Whitman knew she was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  during her nine years as a maid. She and Allred also produced a 2003 Social Security document saying the government number given by Diaz Santillan did not match her name, a tip-off that she might be in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 The letter included a handwritten note from Whitman's husband, a Stanford neurosurgeon, directing the housekeeper to check it out.\par \par \uc2 Whitman said she fired the maid when she learned of her illegal status in June 2009, just months after Whitman had formed an exploratory committee to run for governor. She blamed the campaign of Democratic Gov.-elect Jerry Brown and his union supporters for exposing her.\par \par \uc2 Nurses union executive director Rose Ann DeMoro declined to comment Tuesday to The Associated Press on whether the union helped Diaz Santillan. But in an interview with the AP and in a public letter addressed to Diaz Santillan published last week, she praised the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  for her courage in coming forward.\par \par \uc2 DeMoro said the union's goal is to help working women and advocate for those who don't have a voice.\par \par \uc2 "So it's natural that if someone would come to us for help, that we would help them," she said.\par \par \uc2 She said Diaz Santillan helped highlight "the arrogance of wealth." Whitman set spending records in her race, giving her campaign $144 million from her personal fortune.\par \par \uc2 "It is really just a striking thing. She's one of the richest women in the world and (Diaz Santillan is) someone who is essentially living paycheck to paycheck on survival mode," DeMoro told the AP on Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 A campaign adviser to Whitman, Rob Stutzman, was traveling Tuesday and did not immediately return an e-mail message seeking comment.\par \par \uc2 Whitman hired Diaz Santillan through an agency and paid her $23 an hour for 15 hours per week.\par \par \uc2 The nurse's union backed Brown's candidacy and campaigned vigorously against Whitman, following her to events with a character it dubbed "Queen Meg."\par \par \uc2 The newspaper said the housekeeper was emotionally and financially devastated by her sudden firing by Whitman in 2009, for whom she had worked since 2000. Afterward, Diaz Santillan had asked Whitman for help finding someone who could help her gain legal status.\par \par \uc2 Whitman refused and the former housekeeper claimed Whitman later left her a voicemail message, warning her: "You don't know me, and I don't know you."\par \par \uc2 Diaz Santillan and her immigration attorney are now addressing her status with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writer Juliet Williams contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101124e6bo0000t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.    \par \par \uc2 NOGALES, Ariz. (AP) - There are conflicting stories over what led to the shooting of an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  by a Border Patrol agent last week in southern Arizona's Walker Canyon.\par \par \uc2 A lawyer for the agent's union says the unidentified agent was forced to shoot Jesus Enriquez Castro, 30, because Enriquez threatened the agent with a rock.\par \par \uc2 A lawyer for Enriquez says the wounded man was knocked to the ground by the agent's horse before the agent shot him in the abdomen.\par \par \uc2 Tucson-based attorney Robert Murray tells the Nogales International that Enriquez told him the agent actually ran over Enriquez with the horse. "He was knocked to the ground, and as he was on the ground, the border patrolman, who was still on horseback, shot him," Murray said.\par \par \uc2 The agent, who is Hispanic, then began to cuss out Enriquez in Spanish, Murray said. "He dismounted and pointed the gun at the guy's head and said what translates as: 'Go ahead and run, (expletive), and I'll kill you.'"\par \par \uc2 As for the allegation that Enriquez threatened the agent with a rock, Murray said: "The only time he had his hand near a rock was one he was squeezing and holding onto because he was in so much pain. That's what he tells me."\par \par \uc2 Enriquez was shot at about 9:30 a.m. Nov. 16 after the agent came across a group of 12 illegal immigrants in Walker Canyon, about two miles northeast of Pena Blanca Lake.\par \par \uc2 Witnesses told Santa Cruz County sheriff's investigators that the group scattered and ran, and one woman said she turned to see Enriquez fall to the ground before the shot rang out.\par \par \uc2 But Jim Calle, a lawyer who represents National Border Patrol Council Local 2544, said Enriquez wielded a rock before the agent forced him to drop it by advancing on him with his horse. Enriquez picked up another rock while advancing to within 3 or 4 feet of the agent.\par \par \uc2 At that point, Calle said, the agent felt he had no choice but to shoot.\par \par \uc2 "The bottom line is that the agent acted in response to an alien who kept threatening him," Calle said.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Information from: Nogales International, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.nogalesinternational.com/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.nogalesinternational.com/}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101123e6bn001wc\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) - A man imprisoned for attacking two female joggers was found guilty Monday of murdering Washington intern Chandra Levy, wrapping up a murder mystery that took down a congressman and captured the nation's attention a decade ago.\par \par \uc2 Ingmar Guandique was convicted of first-degree murder for attacking Levy while she exercised in Washington's Rock Creek Park in May 2001. Her disappearance made headlines when she was romantically linked to then-Rep. Gary Condit, D-Calif. Condit was once a suspect, but police no longer believe he was involved in her disappearance.\par \par \uc2 Speaking outside the courthouse, Levy's mother said she'll never be free from the pain of losing her daughter.\par \par \uc2 "I have a lifetime sentence of a lost limb missing from our family tree," Susan Levy said after the hearing. "It's a lifetime of a broken heart."\par \par \uc2 Investigators eventually focused on Guandique, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from El Salvador, and brought formal charges last year. Prosecutors acknowledged they had little direct evidence but said Levy's death fit a pattern of other crimes committed by Guandique in the park.\par \par \uc2 The defense argued that the 29-year-old Guandique (gwahn-DEE'-kay) became a scapegoat for a botched investigation. Levy's body was found about a year after she disappeared.\par \par \uc2 In a telephone interview, Condit's lawyer Bert Fields said the verdict represents a vindication that comes too late to repair the damage his client's career. Still, trial testimony that Condit's DNA was on underwear at Levy's apartment bolstered the idea that the married politician had an affair with the intern.\par \par \uc2 "At least Gary Condit can find some measure of closure to this nightmare," Fields said. "It's a complete vindication, but that comes a little late. Who gives him his career back?" Fields said his client, whose primary loss in 2002 was largely blamed on negative publicity from the case, wasn't going to speak to reporters.\par \par \uc2 The jury deliberated over parts of four days before returning with a verdict shortly before noon Monday. Guandique was convicted on two counts of first-degree murder, one alleging death as part of a kidnapping and one alleging the death as part of an attempted robbery. Jurors had the option of convicting him on a lesser charge of second-degree murder.\par \par \uc2 Guandique could be sentenced to a minimum of 30 years and a maximum of life in prison. Sentencing was set for Feb. 11.\par \par \uc2 Defense lawyer Santha Sonenberg declined comment on whether Guandique would appeal the verdict.\par \par \uc2 Guandique stared straight ahead as the verdict was read, and he shook his head as he left the courtroom. As he has throughout the trial, he wore a turtleneck that covered gang tattoos.\par \par \uc2 Levy's mother squinted and took notes during the hearing, then craned her neck to observe Guandique's reaction to the verdict.\par \par \uc2 Susan Levy had been outspoken in her suspicions of Condit during the investigation, even openly speculating about Condit's involvement in the weeks before the trial.\par \par \uc2 On Monday she indicated that she believed the jury's verdict was correct.\par \par \uc2 "It makes a difference to find the right person who is responsible for my daughter's death," she said.\par \par \uc2 While she was glad to have attended nearly every day of the trial, she added: "I can certainly tell you, it ain't closure."\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors Amanda Haines and Fernando Campoamor-Sanchez obtained a conviction even though they had no eyewitnesses and no DNA evidence linking Guandique to Levy. And Guandique never confessed to police. Prosecutors hung their hopes in large part on a former cellmate of Guandique, Armando Morales, who testified that Guandique confided in him that he killed Levy.\par \par \uc2 Morales said Guandique was worried about being labeled a rapist by fellow inmates if word got out that he was a suspect in the Levy case. According to Morales, Guandique admitted killing Levy as part of an attempted robbery, but said he never raped her.\par \par \uc2 The government also presented testimony from two women who were attacked by Guandique in May and July of 2001 in Rock Creek Park. In both cases, Guandique attacked the women from behind while they jogged on isolated trails but ran off after each woman fought him off.\par \par \uc2 Defense lawyers argued that Morales concocted the confession story to curry favor with prosecutors. While Morales has not received any benefit for his testimony, prosecutors could seek to reduce his jail time in the future.\par \par \uc2 The defense also pointed to DNA from an unknown male that was found on Levy's black running tights. The DNA matched neither Guandique nor Condit, and the defense said it was powerful evidence that the wrong person was on trial. Prosecutors argued the DNA was the result of contamination during the testing process.\par \par \uc2 D.C. Police Chief Cathy Lanier, whose department was criticized for overzealously pursuing Condit, told reporters Monday that "detectives ... can sometimes discover things that were not discoverable in the beginning. The lesson is: Never give up."\par \par \uc2 U.S. Attorney Ronald Machen said "today's verdict does send a message that it's never too late for justice to be done."\par \par \uc2 Juror Linda Norton said the panel went through all of the evidence "in a very deliberate manner" and discussed everything thoroughly. No single piece of evidence stood out in jurors' minds, she said. Those comments were echoed by fellow juror Susan Kelly, a journalist, who said "we were very careful to evaluate all the evidence, and it was a decision based on everything that we had."\par \par \uc2 The monthlong trial featured testimony from Condit himself, who denied any involvement in Levy's disappearance or death. But as he has for the past decade, he refused to answer whether he had an affair with Levy.\par \par \uc2 However, during the trial an FBI forensic expert testified that Condit's DNA was found on Levy's underwear recovered from her apartment, but was not found anywhere at the crime scene where her remains were discovered.\par \par \uc2 Condit's father, the Rev. Adrian B. Condit, said the family was relieved at the verdict.\par \par \uc2 "I'm sure that this will lighten the load for Gary and the entire family. He's been under all the pressure of this," Adrian Condit said in a telephone interview from his home in Modesto, Calif.\par \par \uc2 The elder Condit said he was frustrated that authorities took so long to zero in on Guandique, but he said he was confident they found the right man.\par \par \uc2 And Gary Condit's children, Cadee and Chad Condit, issued a statement Monday saying that "Chandra Levy and her family deserved justice. That it took this long is unforgivable. Our father will tell his story at the appropriate time."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press Writers Jessica Gresko in Washington and Ben Nuckols in Baltimore contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101122e6bm0025t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 LOS ANGELES (AP) - A judge on Friday dismissed a felony burglary charge against a woman accused of breaking into Lindsay Lohan's home, saying there was insufficient evidence.\par \par \uc2 Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Larry Paul Fidler dismissed the count against Rachel Lee, who has been accused by authorities of being one of the masterminds behind a series of break-ins at stars' homes that netted millions in luxury clothes and goods.\par \par \uc2 The decision does not end Lee's legal troubles; she still faces a charge she broke into the home of reality TV star Audrina Patridge, and that she received a fur coat stolen from Lohan's home. She also faces a conspiracy charge, along with four others charged with the burglaries.\par \par \uc2 Lee's attorney, Peter Korn, and prosecutor Chris Baker declined comment after the hearing.\par \par \uc2 Baker had said authorities still hoped to turn up better evidence tying Lee, 20, to the Lohan burglary. Fidler said it appeared she was charged because she was the only Asian member of the so called "Bling Ring" and matched a vague description of one of the Lohan burglars.\par \par \uc2 "You have a nice receiving (charge)," Fidler said, "you don't have a burglary."\par \par \uc2 The judge also expressed concerns about a statement given to police by another woman accused of the Lohan burglary in August 2009. Fidler questioned why the 20-year-old wasn't advised of her Miranda rights before speaking to police after her arrest in October 2009.\par \par \uc2 Baker argued that Tamayo was aware of her right to remain silent and had invoked the right several times before speaking with police. He said a Miranda warning was not necessary because Tamayo's attorney was present for the interview, and did not raise any objections during the session.\par \par \uc2 Tamayo has challenged the admissibility of her statement that she was involved in the Lohan burglary, saying she was coerced into talking to police because she was threatened with deportation. She is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Fidler deferred his ruling on whether Tamayo's statement will remain part of the case, saying he wanted to hear testimony from one of the detectives accused of threatening her with deportation.\par \par \uc2 The judge is expected to rule when the case reconvenes on Jan. 14.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101119e6bj002sk\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 FRESNO, Calif. (AP) - The popular student body president at California State University, Fresno has publicly revealed a personal detail he long sought to keep secret: He is an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Pedro Ramirez, 22, previously told campus administrators in confidence that he was concerned about going public with his immigration status after winning the top post in student government.\par \par \uc2 But that changed Tuesday when The Collegian, the newspaper at the largest university in California's prolific farming region, disclosed his status after receiving an anonymous e-mail.\par \par \uc2 "I don't want this issue to be about me," Ramirez told The Associated Press Wednesday. "This is a big, big issue that should have been addressed a long time ago. My goal is to bring awareness to that."\par \par \uc2 Ramirez was expected to appear Friday at a campus rally in support of the federal "DREAM Act," which would create a path to citizenship for young people living in the country illegally who attend college or join the military.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, student leaders were preparing for impromptu immigration debates Wednesday at an Associated Students Inc. meeting that Ramirez was expected to attend.\par \par \uc2 Ramirez, who has a dual major in political science and agricultural economics, came to the U.S. with his family from a small community in Jalisco, Mexico, when he was 3. He went on to become valedictorian of his high school class in nearby Tulare County, where he prepared for his "long road in higher education," according to his website.\par \par \uc2 He said didn't know he lacked proper immigration papers until high school, when he told his parents he planned to join the military before applying to college and they told him he wasn't a citizen.\par \par \uc2 "It's a relief that I was able to come out in the open because I've been holding this for several years, and hearing stories from other students who have gotten deported or moved because of the fear," said Ramirez, who hopes to open his own business or become a civil rights attorney.\par \par \uc2 "Though this is an obstacle, I want to keep moving up, and I'll do what I can to change the situation and hopefully become a citizen," he said.\par \par \uc2 Ramirez first told Fresno State administrators about his status in June, after his successful campaign to become student body president with the slogan "New Leadership, New Ideas."\par \par \uc2 Administrators verified he would break no campus or student leadership rules by assuming the post, but encouraged him to take on the role as a volunteer because he couldn't legally accept payment, said Paul Oliaro, university vice president for student affairs.\par \par \uc2 "I think it does suggest that even though a student may be undocumented, they have a lot to contribute to the campus and come with skills, knowledge and a willingness to serve," Oliaro said.\par \par \uc2 David Schecter, chair of the political science department and Ramirez's adviser at the school, said Ramirez was a thoughtful, unassuming leader who was serious about student government.\par \par \uc2 Ramirez seemed unfazed by the controversy as they sat together at an athletics advisory council meeting about the risk of concussions in field sports, Schecter said, adding no one mentioned the immigration issue.\par \par \uc2 "Regardless of the uproar, he is still doing his job," Schecter said. "He's the personification of a much larger debate about the role of undocumented Latino Americans in our daily lives, and my hunch is he understands the symbolism here."\par \par \uc2 Ramirez benefits from a law that allows all California residents, regardless of immigration status, to qualify for in-state tuition rates.\par \par \uc2 The state's high court upheld the law this week.\par \par \uc2 (This version CORRECTS Corrects age of Ramirez to 22 instead of 23.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ATLANTA (AP) - A Republican state lawmaker on Wednesday introduced legislation that would ban all Georgia's public colleges and universities from accepting illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 The Board of Regents last month adopted a policy under which the university system's five most competitive schools are effectively barred from accepting \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  applicants beginning in fall 2011.\par \par \uc2 The legislation prefiled on Wednesday by state Rep. Tom Rice would prohibit all of the university system's 35 schools from admitting illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 "I don't think the Regents went far enough," the Norcross Republican said.\par \par \uc2 Rice's legislation will be taken up when state legislators reconvene in January. Immigration is expected to be a hot topic at the state Capitol when lawmakers return.\par \par \uc2 An emboldened Republican majority has pledged to make the issue a priority. It's widely expected that legislators will introduced a bill similar to the tough anti-illegal immigration law adopted in Arizona.\par \par \uc2 Rice's bill came on the same day a joint legislative committee held a hearing on illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 The committee, made up of 14 Republican lawmakers, heard from a number of scheduled speakers, including representatives from the Board of Regents, before opening the floor to public comments.\par \par \uc2 Georgia taxpayers shouldn't have to subsidize the education of illegal immigrants, said Sen. Bill Heath, a Republican from Bremen. For that reason, he opposes the Regents' policy that allows illegal immigrants to attend state schools if they pay out-of-state tuition, he said.\par \par \uc2 "It's to the point where, if that board is going to sit there and do that, I've got to question whether they are worthy to be on the Board of Regents," he said.\par \par \uc2 Wednesday's meeting got contentious at times, especially during the public comments section. After several instances of outbursts or applauding from members of the public, committee chair Rep. Matt Ramsey of Peachtree City admonished the crowd to be quiet, saying Capitol police officers would remove anyone who disrupted the meeting.\par \par \uc2 Georgia's public colleges have become a focus in the illegal immigration debate following a high-profile case involving an undocumented immigrant and Kennesaw State University student who was nearly deported after a traffic arrest in March.\par \par \uc2 Under new policies adopted by the Regents last month, to take effect with the fall 2011 semester, University System of Georgia schools that have rejected any academically qualified applicants in the two most recent academic years will be barred from accepting \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  applicants.\par \par \uc2 That includes five Georgia colleges and universities: the University of Georgia, Georgia Tech, Georgia State University, Medical College of Georgia and Georgia College & State University.\par \par \uc2 ----------\par \par \uc2 House Bill 25: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.legis.ga.gov"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.legis.ga.gov}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101117e6bh002jk\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) - Former California gubernatorial candidate Meg Whitman agreed Wednesday to provide her former housekeeper with $5,500 in unpaid wages to settle a dispute that erupted after it was revealed the woman was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Whitman and her husband Dr. Griffith Harsh IV did not admit any wrongdoing while agreeing to the settlement at a two-hour closed meeting at the California Division of Labor Standards Enforcement.\par \par \uc2 "The larger message is that if you're Meg Whitman or a small employer or anyone else -- if you hire someone, you need to pay them the wages for the hours that they worked. And there are no exceptions," said Gloria Allred, the celebrity attorney representing Nicky Diaz Santillan, Whitman's housekeeper for nine years.\par \par \uc2 Whitman did not attend the hearing. Harsh was present with a family lawyer and left afterward without talking to reporters.\par \par \uc2 Whitman has denounced the allegations as a "baseless smear attack" by Democratic challenger Jerry Brown and the unions who supported his campaign. Still, her campaign began to lose public support after the status of Diaz Santillan was revealed.\par \par \uc2 The former \uc2 eBay\uc2  CEO had portrayed herself as tough on immigration and responded to the revelations by saying she fired Diaz Santillan when she discovered she was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Whitman then refused to offer help when Diaz Santillan asked about how she might be able to gain legal status.\par \par \uc2 The tactic appeared to cost Whitman votes among Latinos and independents that she had courted as essential to winning in a state where Democrats hold a 13 percentage point voter registration advantage.\par \par \uc2 Diaz Santillan told reporters Wednesday that she came forward so other housekeepers would not face discrimination.\par \par \uc2 "As housekeepers, we clean toilets, make beds, mop floors, do laundry, iron, mend their clothes and often we are asked to care for our employer's children, as well," she said, her voice breaking. "We do our best for our employers, and in return all we ask is to be treated with respect and to be paid for all the work we do."\par \par \uc2 Diaz Santillan said she was hired to clean the family's 3,700-square-foot house in Atherton. The couple added duties such as grocery shopping, picking up dry cleaning, taking the children to school and driving Dr. Harsh to the airport, .\par \par \uc2 The settlement reimburses Diaz Santillan for unpaid wages but not the mileage she says she was owed when she ran errands for the family. It also does not cover any penalties that could have been assessed for late payment. Allred had sought between $8,000 to $10,000 for the housekeeper.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101117e6bh0026j\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 FRESNO, Calif. (AP) - The popular student body president at California State University, Fresno has publicly revealed what he had long sought to keep secret: He's an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Pedro Ramirez, 23, previously told campus administrators in confidence that he had been afraid to go public about his status.\par \par \uc2 But that changed Tuesday after The Collegian, the campus newspaper at the largest university in California's prolific farming region, disclosed his status after receiving an anonymous e-mail.\par \par \uc2 "I have been hiding in the shadow, I have been hiding part of me since I was in high school," he told the newspaper.\par \par \uc2 Ramirez offered no immediate comment on the situation in an e-mail to The Associated Press.\par \par \uc2 No immediate rallies or protests were staged in reaction to the revelation. However, Ramirez was expected to lead a campus event Friday in support of the federal "DREAM Act," which would create a path to citizenship for young people living in the country illegally who attend college or join the military.\par \par \uc2 Ramirez, who has a dual major in political science and agricultural economics, was brought to the U.S. from a small community in Jalisco, Mexico, when he was 3. He went on to become valedictorian of his high school class in nearby Tulare County, where he prepared for his "long road in higher education," according to his website. He has said didn't know he was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  until he began applying to colleges.\par \par \uc2 "As a college student, I took it upon myself to build my future and work toward my goals in life," Ramirez said on the website, where he details his dream to be a civil rights attorney. "Hopefully the future is looking good, I am trying to build myself up and we will see."\par \par \uc2 Ramirez told Fresno State officials about his status earlier this year, only after he won the election to serve as president of the local chapter of Associated Students Inc.\par \par \uc2 Administrators verified he would break no campus or student leadership rules by winning the position, but encouraged him to take on the role as a volunteer because he couldn't legally accept payment, said Paul Oliaro, university vice president for student affairs.\par \par \uc2 "I think it does suggest that even though a student may be undocumented, they have a lot to contribute to the campus and come with skills, knowledge and a willingness to serve," Oliaro said.\par \par \uc2 Ramirez benefits from a law that allows all California residents, regardless of immigration status, to qualify for in-state tuition rates.\par \par \uc2 The state's high court upheld the law this week.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101117e6bh0025s\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) - Former California gubernatorial candidate Meg Whitman agreed Wednesday to provide her former housekeeper with $5,500 in unpaid wages to settle a dispute that erupted after it was revealed the woman was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Whitman and her husband Dr. Griffith Harsh IV did not admit any wrongdoing while agreeing to the settlement at a two-hour closed meeting at the California Division of Labor Standards Enforcement.\par \par \uc2 "The larger message is that if you're Meg Whitman or a small employer or anyone else -- if you hire someone, you need to pay them the wages for the hours that they worked. And there are no exceptions," said Gloria Allred, the celebrity attorney representing Nicky Diaz Santillan, Whitman's housekeeper for nine years.\par \par \uc2 Whitman did not attend the hearing. Harsh was present with a family lawyer and left afterward without talking to reporters.\par \par \uc2 Whitman family attorney Dennis Brown said the settlement was a compromise reached for economic reasons. A document outlining the deal states his clients do not admit owing the wages.\par \par \uc2 "It's just very routine, and it's settled for significantly less than even the wages that she claimed," he said.\par \par \uc2 Allred had sought between $8,000 to $10,000 for the housekeeper, who was paid $23 an hour.\par \par \uc2 Brown said Harsh attended the hearing to make sure Diaz Santillan believed her claim.\par \par \uc2 "One of the conditions that we asked, that she look him in the eye and say that this is a true claim: 'I was not paid these wages,'" Brown said. "They refused to do that."\par \par \uc2 The settlement reimburses Diaz Santillan for unpaid wages but not the mileage she said she was owed when she ran errands for the family, including picking up their dry cleaning and driving Harsh to the airport. It also does not call for any penalties that could have been assessed for late payment.\par \par \uc2 During the campaign, Whitman denounced the allegations as a "baseless smear attack" by Democratic challenger Jerry Brown and the unions that supported his campaign. She said she would vigorously defend against Diaz Santillan's claim for back pay.\par \par \uc2 The revelations became a major distraction for Whitman in what was then a dead-heat contest in the governor's race.\par \par \uc2 Whitman was forced to spend days answering questions about whether she had known for years that her former housekeeper was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , rather than talking about issues such as the state budget deficit or education.\par \par \uc2 The issue also dominated a gubernatorial debate, with both candidates engaging in a testy exchange about the matter. It also cost Whitman support from the voters she needed to compete with Brown -- independents, Latinos and the GOP base.\par \par \uc2 The former \uc2 eBay\uc2  CEO had portrayed herself as tough on immigration and had proposed fining those who employed illegal immigrants, opening her to criticism that she set different standards for herself. Whitman fired Diaz Santillan when she said she discovered that she was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  -- just months after announcing her gubernatorial intentions -- but did not turn her in to immigration authorities.\par \par \uc2 Whitman then refused to offer help when Diaz Santillan asked about how she might be able to gain legal status.\par \par \uc2 Diaz Santillan told reporters Wednesday that she came forward so other housekeepers would not face discrimination.\par \par \uc2 "As housekeepers, we clean toilets, make beds, mop floors, do laundry, iron, mend their clothes and often we are asked to care for our employer's children, as well," she said, her voice breaking. "We do our best for our employers, and in return all we ask is to be treated with respect and to be paid for all the work we do."\par \par \uc2 She is pursuing residency status with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and ultimately hopes to become a citizen, said her San Francisco-based immigration attorney, Marc Van Der Hout.\par \par \uc2 He said Diaz Santillan was not in danger of deportation and said the fact that she had falsified documents as she sought work was not unusual in such cases.\par \par \uc2 "The immigration laws recognize that, and there is forgiveness and humanitarian considerations," he said.\par \par \uc2 Van Der Hout would not say where Diaz Santillan and her family are living, nor would he say how she was supporting herself after being fired by Whitman.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writers Tom Verdin and Samantha Young in Sacramento contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101117e6bh0023f\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 House Democrats elect Nancy Pelosi to remain as their leader despite big election losses\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Democrats elected Nancy Pelosi to remain as their leader Wednesday despite massive party losses in this month's congressional elections that prompted some lawmakers to call for new leadership. Pelosi, the nation's first female House speaker, will become minority leader when Republicans assume the majority in the new Congress in January.\par \par \uc2 She defeated moderate Democratic Rep. Heath Shuler of North Carolina, 150-43, in secret balloting in a lengthy closed-door gathering of House Democrats in the Capitol.\par \par \uc2 Pelosi, 70, overcame a rebellion from party centrists, and even some fellow liberals, who argued that the party needs to offer a new face of leadership after losing at least 60 House seats on Nov. 2. She remains popular among the liberals who dominate the party's House caucus. But Shuler's level of support -- plus an earlier 129-68 vote against postponing the election that Pelosi wanted to wrap up quickly -- underscored the degree of discontent in a party that Pelosi had largely bended to her will in the past four years.\par \par \uc2 Republicans voted to keep John Boehner of Ohio as their top House leader. Boehner, who celebrated his 61st birthday Wednesday, had no opposition, and will become speaker in the new Congress. Rep. Eric Cantor, R-Va., will become majority leader.\par \par \uc2 Many House Democrats defended Pelosi, who said the bad economy and high unemployment were the reasons for her party's election losses.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Murkowski wins Alaska Senate race to make history as victorious write-in candidate\par \par \uc2 JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) -- Sen. Lisa Murkowski on Wednesday became the first Senate candidate in more than 50 years to win a write-in campaign, emerging victorious over her tea party rival following a painstaking, week-long count of hand-written votes.\par \par \uc2 The victory completes a remarkable comeback for the Republican after her humiliating loss in the GOP primary to Joe Miller.\par \par \uc2 Her victory became clear when Alaska election officials confirmed they had only about 700 votes left to count, putting Murkowski in safe territory to win re-election. Murkowski is flying back from Washington to Alaska on Wednesday to make an "exciting announcement," proclaiming in an e-mail to supporters that the campaign "made history."\par \par \uc2 Murkowski has a lead of 10,400 votes, a total that includes 8,153 ballots in which Miller observers challenged over things like misspellings, extra words or legibility issues.\par \par \uc2 Miller told Fox News that he is not conceding the race, and will decide at the end of the week whether the campaign will request a recount. Miller has maintained he'll stop fighting if the math doesn't work in his favor.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 GM says common stock to sell for $33 per share in initial public offering worth about $18.2B\par \par \uc2 DETROIT (AP) -- General Motors says its common stock will sell for $33 per share when its initial public offering takes place Thursday. The IPO brings the U.S. government closer to getting back part of the $50 billion it gave GM to help it through bankruptcy protection last year.\par \par \uc2 The government will sell 412 million shares and get $13.6 billion. It will still have about 500 million shares, or about 33 percent of GM. It would have to sell them for $53 a share, or $26.4 billion, for taxpayers to get back their $50 billion back.\par \par \uc2 The government and other GM owners will sell 550 million shares starting Thursday. The IPO will be worth up to $18.2 billion, making it one of the largest in U.S. history.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 White House says Obama will fight to get Senate vote in lame duck session on nuclear treaty\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Barack Obama will push for Senate ratification of a nuclear arms pact with Russia before year's-end despite opposition from a key Republican senator, the White House said Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said he believes the New START deal will come up and pass during the lame-duck Congress, now in progress.\par \par \uc2 The pact is a top foreign policy priority for Obama. It would shrink the U.S. and Russian arsenals of strategic warheads, and revive on-the-ground inspections that ceased when a previous treaty expired nearly a year ago.\par \par \uc2 Sen. Jon Kyl, a leading Republican voice on the issue, dealt the pact a major setback Tuesday by coming out against a vote this year. Kyl, who's been seeking more money and focus on maintaining and modernizing the remaining arsenal, said more time was needed before moving forward.\par \par \uc2 When pressed on the issue Wednesday, Kyl told reporters: "We're talking in good faith."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 GOP governors celebrate victories, look to capitalize on gains and remake image ahead of 2012\par \par \uc2 SAN DIEGO (AP) -- The 2010 elections barely over, nearly three dozen current and incoming Republican governors already are looking to the next election, aiming to capitalize on victories in presidential battlegrounds while working to shed the GOP's white-guy image.\par \par \uc2 Still a full two years away, the 2012 contests hung heavily over the Republican Governors Association's annual conference. No fewer than four potential presidential candidates, including outgoing RGA Chairman Haley Barbour and Vice Chairman Tim Pawlenty, and a slew of GOP rising stars were among the 34 governors and governors-elect planning to attend the two-day gathering.\par \par \uc2 With 800 to 1,000 people expected, the meeting was to be the largest celebration by the political arm of the nation's Republican governors since 1994 when the GOP posted huge gains. Two weeks ago, Republican candidates took advantage of a friendly environment to score enough victories to ensure that the party will control a majority of states -- 29 -- come January.\par \par \uc2 That's significant because Republican governors will set conservative state policy that's expected to counter what's coming out of Washington under a Democratic controlled White House. Also, in many states, Republicans will preside over the every-decade redrawing of congressional and legislative districts, putting the GOP's stamp on the country for the next 10 years.\par \par \uc2 As the meeting got under way, the RGA promoted its victories in key electoral-rich battleground states that will be critical to President Barack Obama's re-election chances -- Ohio, Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Iowa and Wisconsin among them -- as well as triumphs by four female candidates, two Hispanics and one Indian-American.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Next big thing? Drug cuts bad cholesterol, raises good to record levels; bigger study begins\par \par \uc2 CHICAGO (AP) -- An experimental drug boosted good cholesterol so high and dropped bad cholesterol so low in a study that doctors were stunned and voiced renewed hopes for an entirely new way of preventing heart attacks and strokes.\par \par \uc2 "We are the most excited we have been in decades," said Dr. Christopher Cannon of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, who led the study of the novel drug for Merck & Co. "This could really be the next big thing."\par \par \uc2 The drug, anacetrapib (an-uh-SEHT'-ruh-pihb), will not be on the market anytime soon. It needs more testing to see if its dramatic effects on cholesterol will translate into fewer heart attacks, strokes and deaths. Merck announced a 30,000-patient study to answer that question, and it will take several years.\par \par \uc2 But the sheer magnitude of the new medicine's effects so far excited lots of doctors at an American Heart Association conference in Chicago, where results were presented on Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 "The data look spectacular, beyond what anybody would have expected," said Dr. Robert Eckel, a University of Colorado cardiologist and past president of the heart association. "It's like a rocket to Jupiter versus one to the moon. I can think of many of my patients who could use the drug right now."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Whitman agrees to provide former housekeeper with unpaid wages but doesn't admit wrongdoing\par \par \uc2 SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Former California gubernatorial candidate Meg Whitman agreed Wednesday to provide her former housekeeper with $5,500 in unpaid wages to settle a dispute that erupted after it was revealed the woman was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Whitman and her husband Dr. Griffith Harsh IV did not admit any wrongdoing while agreeing to the settlement at a two-hour closed meeting at the California Division of Labor Standards Enforcement.\par \par \uc2 "The larger message is that if you're Meg Whitman or a small employer or anyone else -- if you hire someone, you need to pay them the wages for the hours that they worked. And there are no exceptions," said Gloria Allred, the celebrity attorney representing Nicky Diaz Santillan, Whitman's housekeeper for nine years.\par \par \uc2 Whitman did not attend the hearing. Harsh was present with a family lawyer and left afterward without talking to reporters.\par \par \uc2 Whitman family attorney Dennis Brown said the settlement was a compromise reached for economic reasons. A document outlining the deal states his clients do not admit owing the wages.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Eva Longoria files for divorce from Tony Parker, cites irreconcilable differences\par \par \uc2 LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Eva Longoria filed court papers Wednesday to divorce basketball star Tony Parker, citing irreconcilable differences. Longoria, a star of TV's "Desperate Housewives," and Parker, an NBA All-Star with the San Antonio Spurs, were married July 7, 2007. They have no children together.\par \par \uc2 In the filing, Longoria requested that her name be restored to Eva Jacqueline Longoria. She had taken Parker's name when they married.\par \par \uc2 The filing also stated the couple had a prenuptial agreement but no details were provided.\par \par \uc2 Longoria asked the court to require each side pay its own attorney fees. She also wants to receive spousal support from Parker but not pay any to him.\par \par \uc2 Longoria's spokeswoman, Liza Anderson, said the actress had no comment. Parker wasn't immediately available for comment.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Wis. man accused of shooting TV in rage over Bristol Palin's 'Dancing with the Stars' routine\par \par \uc2 MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- A rural Wisconsin man apparently enraged by Bristol Palin's "Dancing with the Stars" routine blasted his television with a shotgun, leading to an all-night standoff with a SWAT team, investigators said.\par \par \uc2 Steven Cowan, 67, was arrested Tuesday morning after officers coaxed him out of his house in Vermont, a farming community near Madison. Cowan, who is accused of threatening his wife with the gun after destroying the television, appeared in a Madison courtroom Wednesday on a charge of second-degree reckless endangerment. His bail was set at $1,500.\par \par \uc2 Cowan's attorney at the hearing, Jonas Bednarek, declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 Cowan's wife, Janice Cowan, told investigators that her husband suffers from bipolar disorder and had threatened her life in the past.\par \par \uc2 According to court documents, Janice Cowan said her husband came home Monday from the bar and had a beer with dinner before they settled down to watch "Dancing with the Stars."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Black barely beats out Baker for NL Manager of the Year, Gardenhire wins AL award\par \par \uc2 NEW YORK (AP) -- Bud Black hung on to win this race. Ron Gardenhire became a first-time Manager of the Year, too, after so many near misses. A month after his San Diego Padres were knocked out of the playoff chase on the final day, Black nudged Cincinnati's Dusty Baker by one point for the NL award Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 "I guess this vote was sort of like our season, it came down to the wire," Black said on a conference call.\par \par \uc2 Gardenhire was the clear choice in the American League, earning the honor after five times as the runner-up. He led Minnesota to its sixth AL Central title in nine seasons.\par \par \uc2 "Congrats to the best manager in bestball!" Twins center fielder Denard Span tweeted. "Way overdue!"

And the authors say the rates of some crime have fallen since the policy was implemented.\par \par \uc2 Those are some of the conclusions of a University of Virginia study of the policy presented to the county's Board of Supervisors on Tuesday. The study also found that the policy created an ethnic divide in perceptions of the county, but that has been largely repaired.\par \par \uc2 The policy initially allowed officers who reasonably suspected someone might be an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  to ask about their immigration status, but was later changed to require checks for anyone arrested.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101116e6bg001wo\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 BOSTON (AP) - Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick on Tuesday vowed to adopt the rest of an advisory panel's immigration reform recommendations, including pushing for in-state tuition for \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students at state colleges, during his second term.\par \par \uc2 The Democratic governor made the announcement to cheers at the Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition's annual Thanksgiving luncheon. The group's executive director served as co-chair of the advisory panel that made the recommendations.\par \par \uc2 "Now, as we stand on the threshold of another four years, I want to commit to you that we will implement this report in its entirety, working with you, over the next several years," said Patrick, who received a standing ovation from a hundred or so immigrant advocates on Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 "I know that embracing newcomers is out of fashion these days. The concerns over illegal immigration have become so shrill that all immigrants get swept up in that emotion," Patrick added. "And I want you to know that you are welcome here in this Commonwealth. This is your Commonwealth. This is your home."\par \par \uc2 However, the governor did not say specifically how he would implement the recommendations or which ones he would try to adopt first. He said nearly half of the recommendations already have been adopted.\par \par \uc2 Patrick's comments come just two weeks after he won re-election with large support from the state's immigrant population, which is the seventh largest in the country.\par \par \uc2 A year ago, the advisory panel released 130 recommendations on possible Massachusetts immigration reforms following public hearings around the state. Its report -- which largely dealt with legal immigrants and refugees -- called for the return of bilingual education, more translators at health centers and a better system to recognize foreign professional degrees.\par \par \uc2 The report's call for in-state tuition for \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students drew fire from critics and local conservative radio talk shows.\par \par \uc2 Asked by reporters if his plan to implement the rest of the recommendations meant he would push for a state law granting in-state tuition for illegal immigrants, Patrick said Massachusetts would need changes in federal law for that to happen.\par \par \uc2 "Well, my understanding is ... there is a federal law that is in the way of that, and without a change in the federal law we can't do it on our own," said Patrick, who promised to push for the proposal while running for his first term. "I'd like to see that federal law changed."\par \par \uc2 However, several states, including California, Illinois, New Mexico, New York, Texas, Utah, Washington and Wisconsin allow undocumented students to attend state colleges at in-state tuition rates. Federal law does not forbid illegal immigrants from attending universities and colleges in the U.S. State laws vary on whether to grant illegal immigrants in-state tuition rates.\par \par \uc2 Patrick spokesman Kyle Sullivan said the governor wanted to make sure any proposed state law would withstand challenges, which is why he wanted the backing of a federal law.\par \par \uc2 On Monday, the California Supreme Court ruled that illegal immigrants who meet certain residency requirements are entitled to the same tuition breaks offered to in-state high school students to attend that state's public colleges and universities.\par \par \uc2 Following Patrick's announcement, House Minority Leader Bradley H. Jones, Jr. called the in-state tuition plan "a ridiculous idea" and said lawmakers should instead be focused on fixing the state's economy.\par \par \uc2 "Providing in-state tuition to illegal immigrants should not be a priority of Gov. Patrick and the fact that it is does not shock me, but it certainly disappoints me," the North Reading Republican said in a statement. "This idea failed miserably in the legislature a few years back and I am confident it will do so again."\par \par \uc2 Nearly four years ago, Massachusetts House lawmakers soundly rejected a bill that would have allowed illegal immigrants to attend college at in-state tuition rates.\par \par \uc2 The Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation estimated at the time that about 400 to 600 students might enter Massachusetts schools as a result of the bill and that it likely would result in $2.5 million of extra revenue.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101116e6bg000xq\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - The California Supreme Court weighed in Monday on the politically charged immigration fray when it ruled that illegal immigrants are entitled to the same tuition breaks offered to in-state high school students to attend public colleges and universities.\par \par \uc2 While the ruling applies only to California, the case was closely watched nationally because nine other states, including New York and Texas, have similar laws.\par \par \uc2 Republican congressmen Lamar S. Smith of Texas and Steve King of Iowa filed a so-called friends of the court brief urging that illegal immigrants be denied the reduced rate. The politicians and others argued that federal legislation l\par \par \uc2 The lawsuit considered by the court was part of a broader legal assault led by immigration legal scholar Kris Kobach, who has filed numerous cases across the country seeking to restrict the rights of illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 He represented a group of U.S. students who filed the lawsuit seeking to invalidate the California law.\par \par \uc2 Kobach said he would appeal the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court.\par \par \uc2 A unanimous state Supreme Court, led by politically conservative Justice Ming Chin, said the California provision was constitutional because U.S. residents also had access to the reduced rates.\par \par \uc2 The California Legislature passed the controversial measure in 2001 that allowed any student, regardless of immigration status, who attended a California high school for at least three years and graduated to qualify for in-state tuition at the state's colleges and universities. In-state tuition saves each state college student about $11,000 a year and each University of California student about $23,000 a year.\par \par \uc2 A state appellate court ruled in 2008 the law was unconstitutional after a group of out-of-state students who are U.S. citizens filed a lawsuit. The suit alleged the measure violated federal prohibitions barring illegal immigrants from receiving post-secondary benefits not available to U.S. citizens based on state residency.\par \par \uc2 However, the state Supreme Court noted the California law says nothing about state residency, a distinction that foes of the plan said shouldn't matter. Kobach said the federal legislation was meant to prohibit exactly what the California Supreme Court allowed for illegal immigrants on Monday.\par \par \uc2 "It presents a rather incomprehensible reading of the federal statute," Kobach said.\par \par \uc2 The Sacramento-based Pacific Legal Foundation, which supports numerous political efforts, said the spirit of federal law was to deny tuition breaks to illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Foundation attorney Ralph Kasarda, who submitted a friend-of-the-court brief in the case, said California was not in sync with the federal mandate against showing favoritism to illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 "California's policy is also atrocious financial stewardship," he said.\par \par \uc2 The state law also requires illegal immigrants who apply for the in-state tuition to swear they will attempt to become U.S. citizens. The applicants are still barred from receiving federal financial aid.\par \par \uc2 "Through their hard work and perseverance, these students have earned the opportunity to attend UC," said University of California president Mark G. Yudof. "Their accomplishments should not be disregarded or their futures jeopardized."\par \par \uc2 Kobach also failed to invalidate a similar law in Kansas. His lawsuit in Nebraska is pending.\par \par \uc2 The law professor was the chief drafter of Arizona's tough new laws against illegal immigrants, which is pending before a federal appeals court.\par \par \uc2 He was elected earlier this month to serve as secretary of state in Kansas.\par \par \uc2 Democratic leaders in Washington, D.C., are mulling whether to try to pass immigration reform measures before they lose control of the House of Representatives in January.\par \par \uc2 During his re-election campaign, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., promised to try to get a vote on the "DREAM Act," which would create a path to citizenship for youth living in the country illegally who attend college or join the military.\par \par \uc2 White House spokesman Luis Miranda said the administration welcomes any opportunity for Congress to take up the proposal. The legislation "is important to both our national security and our economy," Miranda said.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, retiring Republican Florida Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart is seeking a vote on proposed legislation giving states the option to allow \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students to pay in-state tuition.\par \par \uc2 "Allowing undocumented students to attend primary and secondary schools but requiring that they pay out-of-state tuition for college creates an unfair financial burden," Diaz-Balart said.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writer Suzanne Gamboa in Washington, D.C., contributed to this report\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101116e6bg000b0\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - The California Supreme Court weighed in Monday on the politically charged immigration fray when it ruled that illegal immigrants are entitled to the same tuition breaks offered to in-state high school students to attend public colleges and universities.\par \par \uc2 While the ruling applies only to California, the case was closely watched nationally because nine other states, including New York and Texas, have similar laws.\par \par \uc2 Republican congressmen Lamar S. Smith of Texas and Steve King of Iowa filed a so-called friends of the court brief urging that illegal immigrants be denied the reduced rate.\par \par \uc2 The lawsuit considered by the court was part of a broader legal assault led by immigration legal scholar Kris Kobach, who has filed numerous cases across the country seeking to restrict the rights of illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 He represented a group of U.S. students who filed the lawsuit seeking to invalidate the California law.\par \par \uc2 Kobach did not return a phone call seeking comment about the ruling in California.\par \par \uc2 A unanimous state Supreme Court, led by politically conservative Justice Ming Chin, said the California provision was constitutional because U.S. residents also had access to the reduced rates.\par \par \uc2 The California Legislature passed the controversial measure in 2001 that allowed any student, regardless of immigration status, who attended a California high school for at least three years and graduated to qualify for in-state tuition at the state's colleges and universities. In-state tuition saves each state college student about $11,000 a year and each University of California student about $23,000 a year.\par \par \uc2 A state appellate court ruled in 2008 the law was unconstitutional after a group of out-of-state students who are U.S. citizens filed a lawsuit. The suit alleged the measure violated federal prohibitions barring illegal immigrants from receiving post-secondary benefits not available to U.S. citizens based on state residency.\par \par \uc2 However, the state Supreme Court noted the California law says nothing about state residency, a distinction that foes of the plan said shouldn't matter. The Sacramento-based Pacific Legal Foundation, which supports numerous political efforts, said the spirit of federal law was to deny tuition breaks to illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Foundation attorney Ralph Kasarda, who submitted a friend-of-the-court brief in the case, said California was not in sync with the federal mandate against showing favoritism to illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 "California's policy is also atrocious financial stewardship," he said.\par \par \uc2 The state law also requires illegal immigrants who apply for the in-state tuition to swear they will attempt to become U.S. citizens. The applicants are still barred from receiving federal financial aid.\par \par \uc2 "Through their hard work and perseverance, these students have earned the opportunity to attend UC," said University of California president Mark G. Yudof. "Their accomplishments should not be disregarded or their futures jeopardized."\par \par \uc2 Kobach also failed to invalidate a similar law in Kansas. His lawsuit in Nebraska is pending.\par \par \uc2 The law professor was the chief drafter of Arizona's tough new laws against illegal immigrants, which is pending before a federal appeals court.\par \par \uc2 He was elected earlier this month to serve as secretary of state in Kansas.\par \par \uc2 Democratic leaders in Washington, D.C., are mulling whether to try to pass immigration reform measures before they lose control of the House of Representatives in January.\par \par \uc2 During his re-election campaign, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., promised to try to get a vote on the "DREAM Act," which would create a path to citizenship for youth living in the country illegally who attend college or join the military.\par \par \uc2 White House spokesman Luis Miranda said the administration welcomes any opportunity for Congress to take up the proposal. The legislation "is important to both our national security and our economy," Miranda said.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, retiring Republican Florida Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart is seeking a vote on proposed legislation giving states the option to allow \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students to pay in-state tuition.\par \par \uc2 "Allowing undocumented students to attend primary and secondary schools but requiring that they pay out-of-state tuition for college creates an unfair financial burden," Diaz-Balart said.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writer Suzanne Gamboa in Washington, D.C., contributed to this report\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101115e6bf002t5\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

Brown willing to work with Dems on immigration, says economy should be focus\b0\par\par\uc2 By RUSSELL CONTRERAS   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 451 \uc2 words\par \uc2 12 November 2010\par 16:29\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2010.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 BOSTON (AP) - Republican U.S. Sen. Scott Brown said Friday he wants to work with Democrats on possible federal immigration reform, as long as it's not "fluff."\par \par \uc2 Brown, who replaced the late Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy, a champion of immigrants' rights, told The Associated Press he plans to meet with Senate leaders of both parties about options for reforms. But he said any effort should be focused on improving the economy.\par \par \uc2 "We're going to get fully briefed as to what (Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid) has planned," said Brown before the opening of a new wing focusing on art of the Americas at Boston's Museum of Fine Arts. "(The Democrats) are still the majority in the Senate, so I'm eager to see whether they are going to do stuff for fluff, or (if) they are going to focus on the things that can get us moving again, getting our economy moving."\par \par \uc2 Asked if that meant focusing solely on strong enforcement of immigration laws, Brown said, "it's up to the leader on what he's going to bring forth."\par \par \uc2 Brown said senators are scheduled to meet on Monday. He made those comments almost two weeks after Reid, D-Nev., survived a tight re-election challenge largely by the backing of Latino voters. Reid had championed comprehensive immigration reform measures and has promised to support such legislation.\par \par \uc2 During Brown's campaign for Senate, he said he would push for restrictions on illegal immigration. He also recently called a proposal to give some \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students a pathway to citizenship through college or military service "amnesty."\par \par \uc2 But Brown also has been a target of President Barack Obama, who has tried to court the Massachusetts Republican on immigration and financial reform since he won a special election in January to replace Kennedy. Kennedy, who died in August 2009 at age 77, championed legislation that directly benefited immigrants, their children and their grandchildren and pushed through the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, which fundamentally changed the demographics of the United States.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, some advocates, mainly immigrant students, have staged protests and sit-ins around Brown's office to press him on reforms.\par \par \uc2 Some immigrant advocates said they were encouraged by Brown's comments Friday. Eva Millona, executive director of the Massachusetts Immigrants & Refugee Advocacy Coalition in Boston, said she was glad to hear that immigration reform was on Brown's mind.\par \par \uc2 "I've very pleased to hear that the senator is willing to work with both parties on immigration," Millona said. "This is a positive sign."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101112e6bc00304\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 LOS ANGELES (AP) - A jury has awarded $1.73 million to the family of an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from El Salvador who died of penile cancer that went undiagnosed for more than a year while he was in state and federal custody.\par \par \uc2 The Los Angeles Superior Court jury said state prisons were to blame, in part, for the 2007 death of Francisco Castaneda.\par \par \uc2 After he was convicted of methamphetamine possession in 2005, Castaneda spent more than a year in state and federal facilities, where he was repeatedly denied adequate care for painful lesions on his penis, his lawyer Conal Doyle said Thursday.\par \par \uc2 Doctors who examined Castaneda twice ordered a biopsy, but he never got one. The first time the procedure was ordered, it was denied by a prison's chief physician. The procedure was apparently forgotten the second time because a doctor failed to follow up. A third time, a federal physician ordered a biopsy but Castaneda was released before it could be done.\par \par \uc2 Castaneda was given only pain pills and clean boxer shorts every day, and his condition worsened until he had to have his penis amputated in 2007. He died shortly afterward at age 36.\par \par \uc2 Wednesday's court action was first reported by the San Francisco Chronicle.\par \par \uc2 Because of the Veteran's Day holiday, spokeswomen said neither the state attorney general's office nor the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation could confirm who handled the case for the state or provide further comment.\par \par \uc2 The Chronicle reported that state lawyers denied the doctors were responsible for Castaneda's death, arguing his cancer was untreatable.\par \par \uc2 Doyle said Castaneda's family felt they were forced to go to trial to get answers about his care after repeated failed attempts to learn more.\par \par \uc2 "The family felt like Francisco was vindicated. They felt like this was something that happened for him after he passed away to restore his honor and find justice for him," said Doyle.\par \par \uc2 Castaneda's 17-year-old daughter, Vanessa, will be given $1.5 million in damages, with the rest of the award going toward medical bills incurred for treatment after Castaneda was released from custody.\par \par \uc2 "The jury gave us exactly what we asked for to the penny," said Doyle, noting that the state offered the family $10,000 to settle as recently as one month ago.\par \par \uc2 An April trial date is set for a separate federal lawsuit.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101112e6bc0009h\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 MARIETTA, Ga. (AP) - An \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  college student whose arrest for a minor traffic violation touched off a wider immigration debate was found guilty Thursday in a suburban Atlanta court of driving without a license. But jurors acquitted the 22-year-old woman of a second charge arising from a campus traffic stop last March.\par \par \uc2 Jurors in Cobb County found Jessica Colotl guilty of driving without a license after about 30 minutes of deliberations. They acquitted her of a second charge of impeding the flow of traffic stemming from the stop.\par \par \uc2 "I don't agree with it, but I have to follow the verdict," Colotl said.\par \par \uc2 Defense Attorney Jerome Lee said Colotl will appeal the guilty verdict.\par \par \uc2 Police at Kennesaw State University northwest of Atlanta stopped the political science major March 29 in a car on a campus parking lot. There was little dispute Thursday over facts as prosecutors and Colotl's defense both agreed she was in the driver's seat and didn't present a valid license at the time.\par \par \uc2 After briefly detaining her, Cobb authorities turned her over to federal immigration officials once they learned she was in the country illegally. She was 11 when her parents had crossed the border with her from Mexico.\par \par \uc2 Colotl spent 37 days in immigration detention but U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials subsequently agreed to delay action on Colotl's case for a year while she completes her studies.\par \par \uc2 Colotl told reporters before testimony began that she plans to graduate in the spring and wants to stay in the United States. "I've grown up in this country, and I've adopted all the American values," she said, calling herself "an American without papers."\par \par \uc2 Colotl's case called attention to the issue of illegal immigrants attending state universities and colleges in Georgia and the nation. The state Board of Regents has since appointed a special committee to examine the issue and voted last month to adopt stricter rules governing \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students.\par \par \uc2 Judge Kathryn Tanksley set sentencing for Monday.\par \par \uc2 Driving without a license carries a minimum sentence of 48 hours in jail, but Colotl is expected to receive credit for 45 hours she already served. Colotl's lawyers, upon filing an appeal, said they would take steps that could delay sentencing if the judge consents.\par \par \uc2 A county solicitor, Rachel Bearman, said she was pleased with the verdict.\par \par \uc2 Colotl is among hundreds of thousands of young people who have been brought into the U.S. illegally by their parents After her border crossing at 11, she eventually graduated from high school in Georgia and entered Kennesaw State University in 2006, joining a sorority.\par \par \uc2 Following her arrest, she received backing from civil liberties and immigration rights groups and told reporters she hoped her ordeal would help persuade leaders to work for an overhaul of the country's immigration laws.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101112e6bc0001h\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - A Republican lawmaker likened \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  births to rats multiplying while he was questioning state officials at a committee hearing.\par \par \uc2 Rep. Curry Todd had been asking Tuesday if the state-funded Cover Kids program checked citizenship before paying for health care. He was told that the federal government didn't allow it for prenatal care because any child born in the U.S. is a citizen.\par \par \uc2 Todd said that means the immigrants can "go out there like rats and multiply."\par \par \uc2 No other lawmakers on the state Fiscal Review Committee responded to the remarks. When contacted by The Associated Press on Wednesday, Todd said he was wrong to use that choice of words.\par \par \uc2 The Collierville Republican said using the term "anchor babies" probably would have been more palatable.\par \par \uc2 The term, considered derogatory by some, is a reference to children born to at least one \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  parent.\par \par \uc2 "I was actually wrong, and I admit when I'm wrong," Todd said.\par \par \uc2 However, he said the issue needs to be addressed.\par \par \uc2 "Something needs to be done where there are some checks and balances in the system, because the Tennessee taxpayers are footing the bill for this," said Todd. He has been trying to require proof of citizenship for participants in any state-run health programs.\par \par \uc2 Immigrant rights advocate Stephen Fotopulos, director of the Tennessee Immigrant and Refugee Rights Coalition, said Todd's remark before the committee is inexcusable.\par \par \uc2 "This kind of dehumanizing rhetoric is all too common on some talk radio shows, where hate sells and there's no accountability," Fotopulos said. "But there's absolutely no excuse for it to come out of the mouth of an elected official in Tennessee."\par \par \uc2 Todd's comment harkens back to one made by former Democratic Rep. Frank Buck who in 2004 used the derogatory term "wetback" twice in committee to describe illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 "I'm brash, but I'm not as bad as I may appear," Buck said at the time. "I didn't know that word was offensive."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writer Erik Schelzig contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101111e6bb0004g\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 MARIETTA, Ga. (AP) - A jury on Thursday found an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who attends a Georgia university guilty of driving without a license in case that sparked a wider debate over immigration. But after deliberating for about half an hour, the Cobb County jurors acquitted Jessica Colotl of a second charge of impeding traffic.\par \par \uc2 "I'm feeling good," Colotl said after the verdict. "I don't agree with it, but I have to follow the verdict."\par \par \uc2 Defense Attorney Jerome Lee said Colotl will appeal the guilty verdict.\par \par \uc2 Cobb County Assistant Solicitor Rachel Bearman said she was pleased with the jury's decision.\par \par \uc2 Kennesaw State University Police stopped the 22-year-old political science major for a traffic violation in March. After briefly detaining her, Cobb authorities turned her over to federal immigration officials after learning she was in the country illegally. She was 11 when her parents crossed the border with her from Mexico.\par \par \uc2 Colotl spent 37 days in immigration detention but U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials last spring agreed to delay action on Colotl's case for a year so she can complete her studies.\par \par \uc2 Colotl told reporters before testimony began that she plans to graduate in the spring and wants to stay in the United States.\par \par \uc2 "I've grown up in this country, and I've adopted all the American values," she said, calling herself "an American without papers."\par \par \uc2 There was little dispute Thursday over the facts of the case. Both sides agreed that Colotl was in the driver's seat of a car that was stopped March 29 in a campus parking lot and that she did not have a valid driver's license at the time.\par \par \uc2 But Lee and fellow defense lawyer Chris Taylor argued that Colotl was planning to work late on a research paper that day and was waiting for a someone to come out and vacate a spot near the library so she wouldn't have to walk far alone at night. There was plenty of room for other cars to get around her, they argued.\par \par \uc2 Under Georgia law a person who is charged with driving without a license must be found not guilty of the charge if she has a license at the time of her court appearance, Lee and Taylor said. Colotl had fulfilled that requirement by obtaining a learner's permit last Friday and scheduling a driving test for later in the month, they said. Lee argued that, according to Georgia law, an instructional permit is a class of driver's license.\par \par \uc2 Bearman argued it wasn't necessary for Colotl's car to be completely blocking the throughway in the parking lot for her to be considered to be impeding the flow of traffic. She also argued that a learner's permit is not the same as a driver's license, pointing out that Colotl could not legally get in a car after the trial and drive away by herself.\par \par \uc2 "She has right now a class CP. That's a permit," Bearman said in her closing statement. "It's the first step you have to go through to get an actual license."\par \par \uc2 Bearman also tried to convince the jury that her witness, the university police sergeant who arrested Colotl, was very reliable, his testimony backed up by a video from a camera mounted on his cruiser that was shown to the jury. Meanwhile, she portrayed Colotl as unreliable and squirming under questioning.\par \par \uc2 Colotl's case called attention to the issue of illegal immigrants attending state universities and colleges in Georgia. After appointing a special committee to examine the issue, the state Board of Regents, which oversees those institutions, voted last month to adopt stricter rules governing \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students.\par \par \uc2 Judge Kathryn Tanksley scheduled a sentencing hearing for Monday morning.\par \par \uc2 Driving without a license carries a minimum sentence of 48 hours in jail, but Colotl will receive credit for 45 hours she already served in Cobb County. Upon filing an appeal, Colotl's lawyers will ask for an appeal bond, which would effectively delay sentencing if the judge grants it, Taylor said.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101111e6bb003b4\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 NEW YORK (AP) - Luis Guerra swore he had nothing to do with any murder, that whoever picked him out of a lineup was wrong. Still, he was held at the Rikers Island jail for more than a year before the charges were dropped.\par \par \uc2 It didn't end there. Federal immigration officials stepped in because Guerra was in the country illegally, brought over from Mexico as a child. He ended up in federal immigration detention in Texas before being allowed to return to Manhattan; he's now waiting to find out whether he'll be shipped to a country he hasn't seen since he was 9.\par \par \uc2 Merely being at Rikers put him on the radar of the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement bureau, said Guerra, 21, who's trying to get a college degree while awaiting word on his future. City authorities made "a mistake, and now I'm paying for their mistake," he said. "I was living a normal life before."\par \par \uc2 Removing illegal immigrants who come in contact with the criminal justice system is a significant part of ICE's nationwide enforcement efforts, but it needs the cooperation of local law enforcement to do so. The relationships that make it work are causing concern not just in New York, but also in places like Arlington County, Va.; Washington, D.C.; Santa Clara County, Calif.; and San Francisco.\par \par \uc2 Immigrant advocates and some politicians find it disturbing that local officials work with ICE on identifying illegal immigrants. In New York, they say, it puts a city that owes its existence to immigrants in the deportation business and breeds fear among immigrants that any contact with authorities -- even reporting crimes -- could have severe consequences.\par \par \uc2 "It is really not a good idea to have large segments of your community be afraid of law enforcement," said Nancy Morawetz, a professor at the New York University School of Law and part of its Immigrant Rights Clinic.\par \par \uc2 Guerra, testifying at a City Council hearing on the issue Wednesday, said he saw that firsthand after his 2007 arrest on a second-degree murder charge.\par \par \uc2 "There were people who witnessed the murder, people who could have cleared my name," he said, "but they were afraid to go to the police after they heard what was happening to me with immigration."\par \par \uc2 ICE has had a presence at New York's main jail complex for at least 15 years. The city Department of Correction says federal regulations require it to comply with things like detainers that ICE puts on inmates it wants custody of.\par \par \uc2 In the 2010 fiscal year, 3,155 out of 13,386 foreign-born inmates had ICE detainers, and 2,552 of them were released directly into federal custody when they were discharged from Rikers, the department said. Nationwide, about half of the nearly 393,000 people removed from the country in the past year were criminals, according to Homeland Security Department statistics.\par \par \uc2 "Our top priority is to identify and remove criminal convicted aliens who post a threat to the community and to national security," said ICE spokesman Ivan Ortiz-Delgado.\par \par \uc2 ICE says the city is obligated to hold anyone the agency has put a detainer on, and Department of Correction spokeswoman Sharman Stein echoed that.\par \par \uc2 If anything, ICE should be taking more people into the detention and deportation system, said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which supports tighter controls on immigration.\par \par \uc2 He argued that every \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  is deportable at any time, and that as it is, ICE exercises discretion in terms of whom it detains. Advocates' fears of a dragnet dragging are overblown, he said.\par \par \uc2 "I'd be ecstatic if this program worked the way immigrant rights groups fear it does," he said.\par \par \uc2 The federal agency often comes under fire for its practices, with critics citing issues like transfers of detainees far away from family and friends, and people in the system having limited access to legal resources that could allow them to stay in the country.\par \par \uc2 The city is going along with that by not exercising more care in who gets turned over to ICE, critics say. It's one thing for people convicted of violent felonies to be turned over, they say; it's another for someone convicted of a misdemeanor or of nothing at all.\par \par \uc2 That would include Jose Reyes, a legal resident from the Dominican Republic. Arrested in May 2009 after an argument with his ex's new boyfriend, an immigration detainer was put on him because of a misdemeanor drug arrest from 1997. He was able to avoid deportation after that case was reopened and the charge taken down to disorderly conduct.\par \par \uc2 "They say they're trying to arrest only criminals," he said through a translator at Wednesday's hearing. "It is not fair that people who have these small convictions are deported."\par \par \uc2 Critics also worry what the future holds as the Secure Communities program, a more extensive immigration enforcement effort not yet in use in New York City, continues to be implemented around the country as part of a national rollout planned by 2013.\par \par \uc2 There is confusion over whether localities can opt out of the program, under which the fingerprints of anyone arrested for anything from a traffic violation to a violent crime are automatically checked against federal immigration records.\par \par \uc2 Arlington County, Washington and Santa Clara County voted recently to opt out the program, saying it could lead to racial profiling, and San Francisco officials tried -- with no luck -- to drop it.\par \par \uc2 "I understand that the goal of the relationship between ICE and the Department of Correction is one that is based on the goal of public safety, and keeping New York City residents safe from individuals who are criminals and could do harm," Council Speaker Christine Quinn, among New York's most powerful politicians, said Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 But, she said, "many appropriate concerns have been raised that the way the Department of Correction is working with ICE is in a way that has granted them such latitude that the implementation of this program goes far beyond."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101111e6bb00346\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ATLANTA (AP) - Atlanta police on Wednesday arrested a handful of activists who were protesting the state Board of Regents' decision to tighten its policies governing \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  applicants to Georgia colleges and universities.\par \par \uc2 About 25 protesters gathered outside the building where the regents were meeting. The protesters marched for about an hour on the sidewalk, calling for equal access and justice.\par \par \uc2 "Don't hate, educate!" the protesters chanted. "Education, not deportation!" They held signs with slogans like "Students are not criminals" and "Education is a human right."\par \par \uc2 Shortly after 11 a.m., several protesters, including the Rev. Markel Hutchins, stepped into the intersection of Washington and Trinity streets. Police asked them to clear the street, but they refused.\par \par \uc2 "We are here and we have to display our conscientious objections," Hutchins told police before he was escorted out of the intersection, calling the ban on \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  applicants "one of the most regressive policies" the state has passed.\par \par \uc2 "We will stand in civil disobedience and offer our bodies as a living sacrifice," Hutchins said.\par \par \uc2 He and three others were arrested.\par \par \uc2 The new policies were approved last month and take effect with the fall 2011 semester. University System of Georgia schools will be barred from accepting \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  applicants if the school has rejected any academically qualified applicants in the two most recent academic years. The regents took up the issue after a committee investigated complaints that Georgia taxpayers were subsidizing the education of undocumented students through in-state tuition and that undocumented students were bumping academically qualified Georgians from classrooms.\par \par \uc2 The university system began focusing on \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  students in the wake of a high-profile case involving an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  and Kennesaw State University student who was nearly deported after an arrest in March. Jessica Colotl was arrested after a traffic stop for driving without a license and turned over to immigration authorities, who agreed to defer action on her case for a year, allowing her to complete her classes.\par \par \uc2 Critics of the ban are calling for the regents to reverse their decision.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101110e6ba002pa\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 JACKSON, Miss. (AP) - Mississippi's attorney general has asked a federal court to throw out a lawsuit filed on behalf of a Mexican \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who claims the state welfare agency and a hospital conspired to take her newborn to give to a white couple for adoption.\par \par \uc2 U.S. Magistrate Linda R. Anderson has set a Dec. 15 conference for the case that's at the heart of a national debate over parental rights of illegal immigrants who give birth to children while in the United States.\par \par \uc2 The Southern Poverty Law Center filed suit in August against the state Department of Human Services, two social workers, \uc2 Singing River Health System\uc2  and a hospital interpreter.\par \par \uc2 In documents filed in U.S. District Court, Attorney General Jim Hood has asked that the complaint be dismissed.\par \par \uc2 Singing River Health Systems also denied the allegations of the suit in a separate filing.\par \par \uc2 "This complaint has been baseless and without accurate facts from the beginning. It is a shame that the Health System has even had to defend itself and its employees against such ridiculously frivolous charges," Richard Lucas, a hospital spokesman said this week.\par \par \uc2 The suit alleged Cirila Baltazar Cruz's constitutional right to family integrity were violated after she gave birth to a baby girl at the hospital in November 2008.\par \par \uc2 Cruz -- who spoke no English and little Spanish and could not read or write -- was interviewed by a hospital interpreter. The interpreter spoke Spanish, not Chatino, a dialect indigenous to Cruz's native Oaxaca in rural Mexico, the lawsuit alleges.\par \par \uc2 The suit alleged the interpreter told officials that Cruz was trading sex for housing and wanted to give the child up for adoption. After social workers for DHS intervened, Cruz's child was taken into state custody and placed in the home of the white couple, who work as attorneys.\par \par \uc2 Cruz said in the court filing that she tried to explain to the interpreter she worked in a Chinese restaurant and lived in an apartment.\par \par \uc2 Cruz and her daughter were separated for a year while the child was in the couple's care. The mother and child were reunited in November 2009 and have since returned to Mexico.\par \par \uc2 Hood declined to comment on the case beyond what can be found in the court documents that were filed Oct. 26. Hood's office contends the suit should be dismissed because it fails to state a claim for which relief can be granted, among other reasons.\par \par \uc2 "What they're saying is that even if everything we say is accurate, they haven't done anything illegal. We find that to be an extraordinary position. These entities and defendants did conspire to take this woman's baby illegally from her. On its face, that's a pretty strong accusation of illegal conduct," said Mary Bauer, legal director of the law center.\par \par \uc2 The suit also claimed officials had contacted U.S. Immigration and Customs officials about Cruz' status.\par \par \uc2 There have been similar cases around the country.\par \par \uc2 Last year, the Nebraska Supreme Court ruled in favor of a Guatemalan woman who had lost custody of her children after she was arrested and deported. Justices said Nebraska officials didn't prove Maria Luis was an unfit mother when they terminated her parental rights.\par \par \uc2 Luis had been charged with obstructing justice for falsely identifying herself to authorities. After she was deported, her two children -- one of whom was born in the U.S. -- were placed in foster care. Attorneys say Luis didn't have time to file an appeal to regain custody before she was deported.\par \par \uc2 "The state of Nebraska didn't want to send the kids to Guatemala. They thought it was in the best interest of the children because living conditions in the U.S. were superior to Guatemala," said Luis' attorney Omar Riojas of DLA Piper LLP.\par \par \uc2 U.S. Rep. Lynn Woolsey, D-Calif., filed a bill in 2009 requiring state child welfare systems to assign case workers who can communicate in the native language of the child and their family, or provide an interpreter who can facilitate the meetings. There's been little action on the measure.\par \par \uc2 Riojas said he and other immigrants' rights attorneys are closely watching the Cruz case.\par \par \uc2 "States shouldn't be trying to determine which countries offer a better lifestyle," Riojas said Wednesday. "Immigration law should have no bearing whatsoever on the decision to terminate parental rights," he said.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101103e6b3004gt\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

Dave Heineman sweeps to an easy re-election with a cool $1.3 million and some change left in his campaign war chest. With so many speculating that the Republican governor is likely to challenge U.S. Sen. Ben Nelson in 2012, the question is whether he can use that money to finance a Senate run in 2012. The short answer is: no. State and federal campaign finance laws don't allow for the money to be signed over to a federal campaign. But political experts agree that there are ways to use the money to his advantage if he decides to take on the lone Democrat in Nebraska's congressional delegation. By Margery A.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 DETROIT (AP) - Republicans regained control of the Michigan Supreme Court by capturing two seats Tuesday, riding the same electoral wave that made the GOP victorious in all major statewide races.\par \par \uc2 Wayne County Judge Mary Beth Kelly and incumbent Justice Robert Young Jr. beat the three other candidates. The result means conservatives will form a 4-3 majority on the court beginning in January, after two years in which Democrats largely had control.\par \par \uc2 Kelly was first with 30 percent, followed by Young at 28 percent, Justice Alton Davis at 19 percent and Oakland County Judge Denise Langford Morris at 17 percent, with 88 percent of precincts reporting. The fifth candidate on the ballot, Libertarian Bob Roddis, got less than 10 percent of the vote.\par \par \uc2 "I was just looking not to finish third," said Kelly, who is no relation to Chief Justice Marilyn Kelly.\par \par \uc2 Davis was appointed to the court in August by Gov. Jennifer Granholm after the resignation of Justice Elizabeth Weaver. His arrival gave Democrats a 4-3 edge, although they already had a working majority with Weaver, a moderate Republican, joining them in many cases.\par \par \uc2 Backed by business groups, Young and Kelly promoted themselves as conservatives who wouldn't second-guess the Legislature and make their own law. Davis and Morris, Democrats who were the favorites of unions and trial lawyers, promised to cool the rancor between warring justices.\par \par \uc2 The candidates were nominated by political parties, but there was no party designation next to their names.\par \par \uc2 "They threw everything at us but I am still standing," Young said, referring to a barrage of negative ads by the state Democratic Party.\par \par \uc2 TV ads tried to portray Young as a judge who favored big polluters, especially the company responsible for a major oil spill last summer in the Kalamazoo River. In the campaign's home stretch, Weaver stepped forward and accused him of using the N-word during private conferences with other justices in 2006.\par \par \uc2 Young, who is black, acknowledged using the word but said he was quoting a disgraced former judge who had lost her job because of it. Kelly, too, was hit with a TV ad accusing her of failing to lock up an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who was subsequently convicted of kidnapping and killing a Detroit-area man.\par \par \uc2 "I never imagined such a hellish set of attacks," said Young, who added, "I think it backfired."\par \par \uc2 Mark Brewer, chairman of the Democratic Party, said he had no regrets over the campaign.\par \par \uc2 "What you saw here was a national wave in terms of people voting Republican," Brewer said in explaining why Davis and Morris lost. "That just overwhelmed everything else."\par \par \uc2 Besides the Supreme Court, Republicans won races for Michigan governor, secretary of state and attorney general.\par \par \uc2 Davis declined to comment. It's possible that Granholm could send him back to the state appeals court where he was serving before his appointment to the Supreme Court last summer. His seat remains vacant.\par \par \uc2 Since 2009, the Democratic-controlled court has reversed some key decisions of its former conservative majority, especially in auto-injury law. Young and Kelly, however, suggested they wouldn't be eager to revisit the cases.\par \par \uc2 "I'm not going to prejudge any of them," Young said.\par \par \uc2 Kelly said overturning legal precedent has to "be looked at very cautiously."\par \par \uc2 "I'm not one who promotes looking at legal issues again just because they may have been wrongly decided on that issue alone," she said.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101103e6b3001yn\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

Perry race to election finish\b0\par\par\uc2 By KELLEY SHANNON   \par \uc2 AP Political Writer\par \uc2 539 \uc2 words\par \uc2 2 November 2010\par 04:41\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2010.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 AUSTIN, Texas (AP) - The long, expensive race between Republican Gov. Rick Perry and Bill White, the Democrats' best hope in years to win the Texas' top office, headed to its finish Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 Both candidates spent millions of dollars airing television ads and trekking around Texas, visiting rural towns and crowded urban neighborhoods. They hammered each other over alleged wrongdoing in office, immigration and what's going on in Washington, D.C.\par \par \uc2 Perry, who is seeking an unprecedented third full four-year term, tapped into anti-government fervor and seized opportunities to link White with President Barack Obama and national Democrats.\par \par \uc2 White, a former Houston mayor and deputy U.S. energy secretary, worked to keep his distance from Obama and even steered clear of the president's appearances during Obama's trip to Texas in August. In contrast, Perry greeted Obama upon his arrival at the Austin airport -- he said he wanted to talk to Obama about border security -- and then used a picture of the event in a TV ad to say he'd confronted the Democratic president.\par \par \uc2 Having never lost a race in his 25 years in state office, Perry relied on a practiced and polished approach to campaigning. He stuck to a couple of main themes, criticizing Washington and boasting that Texas has fared better than much of the nation economically by creating jobs during his tenure.\par \par \uc2 A starkly different style marked White's campaigning.\par \par \uc2 Slow-talking and deliberate with his words, White told audiences that while Perry was better at television sound bites, he was better at getting results. He pointed to his record of responding to hurricanes and to property tax cuts when he was leader of Houston for six years.\par \par \uc2 Voters cast their ballots Tuesday and during two weeks of early voting without ever seeing the two side by side in a televised debate. Perry refused to debate because he said White hadn't released all his tax returns from his years in public service.\par \par \uc2 Perry also refused to speak to newspaper editorial boards. White ended up pulling in major newspaper endorsements.\par \par \uc2 Polls the past few weeks showed that the debate refusal didn't appear to hurt Perry, the state's longest-serving governor. He continued to hold a lead in polls and even expanded his advantage to double digits by the final weekend before the election.\par \par \uc2 White accused Perry of staying in office too long and using state job creation funds to reward his campaign contributors. Perry attacked White over his investment with a company that helped the city in its emergency response during Hurricane Rita.\par \par \uc2 The race turned even nastier in the final week when Perry launched an ad claiming Houston's policies toward enforcing immigration laws played a role in the shooting death of a police officer who was killed by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 White denied the accusation and said Perry was exploiting the officer's grieving widow. He also said Perry's administration removed \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  sex offenders from a public database once they were deported, but that the names were added back in once White's mayoral office complained.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101102e6b2001qh\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 LOS ANGELES (AP) - Weeks of wall-to-wall advertising, personal attacks and record-setting campaign spending were coming to an end Tuesday, as California voters decided whether they wanted to return Democrat Jerry Brown to the governor's seat or take a chance on a political novice, billionaire businesswoman Meg Whitman.\par \par \uc2 The winner's prize: trying to lead the troubled state out of its high unemployment, stagnant economy and political gridlock.\par \par \uc2 Brown, the state's attorney general, lead in public opinion polls heading into Election Day after facing Whitman's $175 million campaign. The $142 million she contributed from her personal fortune was the highest level of personal spending ever for any candidate in a state race.\par \par \uc2 Whitman used part of her fortune to target ethnic voters and women, as well as build an intensive get-out-the-vote effort. She also was hoping to capture some of the national momentum for Republican candidates.\par \par \uc2 The race between Whitman, the former \uc2 eBay\uc2  chief executive, and Brown, who was governor from 1975-83, turned increasingly negative in the final weeks, when the airwaves were filled with attack ads.\par \par \uc2 Whitman's campaign was knocked off message when it was revealed that she had employed an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  housekeeper for nine years, undermining her warnings that employers should be held responsible and fined if they hire illegal workers.\par \par \uc2 Brown faced his own controversy after a Los Angeles police union released an audio tape of a private conservation between Brown and his campaign staffers. A female aide is overheard calling Whitman a "whore" for currying favor with the union to win its endorsement.\par \par \uc2 The controversies at times overshadowed debates on more substantive issues such as job creation, the budget deficit, college costs and public education.\par \par \uc2 Successive years of multibillion-dollar budget deficits have left the state's general fund with $15 billion less than it had just three years ago, leading to severe cuts in many state programs and higher costs for college and university students.\par \par \uc2 Whitman, 54, ran on a platform of reducing regulations, cutting government spending, encouraging job growth and turning around the state's beleaguered schools.\par \par \uc2 She ran a highly scripted campaign, riding a bus up and down the state during the campaign's final weeks and relying on her highly paid consultants for direction. After a series of incidents that chipped away at her reputation, polls showed that many Californians had not connected with her -- or worse, simply didn't like her.\par \par \uc2 Whitman acknowledged as much in a recent television ad, saying "I know many of you see this election as an unhappy choice between a longtime politician with no plan for the future and a billionaire with no government experience."\par \par \uc2 Indeed, voters also told pollsters they weren't bowled over by Brown, 72, who waited until Labor Day to officially launch his campaign. Brown was buoyed by $25 million in spending from union-backed independent expenditure groups.\par \par \uc2 He told voters that after decades of public service he was uniquely qualified to bring lawmakers together to turn the state around. He compared Whitman's lack of experience to that of Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican who stepped into the governor's office with no previous experience as an elected official.\par \par \uc2 The former Hollywood action star will leave office in January a little more than seven years after voters recalled former Democratic Gov. Gray Davis.\par \par \uc2 Neither Brown nor Whitman offered specifics about how to solve California's budget gridlock.\par \par \uc2 Whitman made sweeping proposals, such as pledging to eliminate 40,000 state workers -- later cut to 33,000 in the wake of budget cuts -- but offered few details about how to accomplish this or other plans while working with a state Legislature controlled by Democrats.\par \par \uc2 Brown campaigned on a moderate platform, saying he would not raise taxes without voter approval and would buck the powerful public employee unions that have backed him to bring the state's spending in line with revenue.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101102e6b200017\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Arizona's immigration law faced tough scrutiny from a federal appeals panel Monday as the state's governor appeared in person to support the controversial provision on the day before the election in which she's seeking her first full term.\par \par \uc2 The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals signaled it was ready to toss out the provision of Arizona's law that criminalizes the failure to carry immigration papers showing lawful residency in the United States.\par \par \uc2 But the three-judge panel didn't tip its hand over which way it was leaning on other provisions of the state law that touched off a national furor when Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer signed it April 23. The federal government filed a lawsuit soon after to invalidate the measure.\par \par \uc2 U.S. Deputy Solicitor General Edwin Kneedler argued Monday that the provisions in question violate laws making immigration enforcement the exclusive domain of the federal government.\par \par \uc2 Among the provisions at issue is the requirement that police -- when enforcing other laws -- must question the immigration status of people they have reason to suspect are in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 "It's how the state wants to use its people," said Judge Carlos Bea, appointed to the bench by President George W. Bush. "The state can turn over an illegal to federal officials."\par \par \uc2 Kneedler responded that requiring local law enforcement officials to check the immigration status of everyone they suspect as being an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  takes away from their investigatory discretion. He also said the law intrudes upon foreign policy and diplomacy, areas that are left for the federal government.\par \par \uc2 "If every state did this, we would have a patchwork of law," Kneedler said.\par \par \uc2 Arizona's legislature passed the law after years of complaints that the federal government hasn't done enough to lessen the state's role as the nation's busiest illegal entry point. Its passage ignited protests, with thousands taking to the streets of Phoenix saying the law would lead to racial profiling. The law prompted lawsuits from the U.S. Justice Department, civil rights groups and other opponents seeking to throw it out.\par \par \uc2 Less than a day before the law was to take effect, U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton blocked key provisions, including a requirement that immigrants carry immigration papers. On Monday, Bea told Kneedler "I don't think you have to spend a whole lot of time" arguing the unconstitutionality of that provision.\par \par \uc2 Bea opened the hearing by sharply questioning Arizona's lawyer John Bouma about previous court rulings that upheld the supremacy of the federal government in deciding immigration matters. Bouma responded that Arizona was not seeking to change federal immigration policy.\par \par \uc2 "All Arizona is saying is play by the rules," Bouma said. "Arizona is bearing the brunt of the federal government's failure to enforce it."\par \par \uc2 Judge John Noonan, appointed by President Ronald Reagan, and Judge Richard Paez, appointed by President Bill Clinton, rounded out the appeals panel, which has no deadline to act.\par \par \uc2 Hundreds of protesters gathers outside the federal courthouse in San Francisco before the hour-long hearing. Opponents of the law in this politically liberal city outnumbered supporters.\par \par \uc2 Afterward, Arizona's governor said she intended to appeal any adverse ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court. Illegal immigrants are overwhelming Arizona's health care systems, schools and prisons, she said.\par \par \uc2 The law and the federal lawsuit to overturn it have breathed new life into Brewer's re-election campaign against Democrat Terry Goddard, the state's attorney general. Brewer, a Republican, took office in January 2009 when Janet Napolitano became Homeland Security secretary.\par \par \uc2 Brewer said the Obama administration's lawsuit was misguided because the state law seeks only to address a growing problem in Arizona.\par \par \uc2 "We are not the enemy -- we are part of the United States," she said. "We need more help and support."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101101e6b1003fr\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

Employers must fill out and sign the form, which requires them to acknowledge, under penalty of perjury, that they examined documents that allow an employee to work.\par \par \uc2 The Obama administration a year ago announced plans to ramp up I-9 audits -- a shift from the notorious work site raids common under the Bush administration.\par \par \uc2 But most employers with questionable record-keeping aren't being punished for failing to prove their employees have legal status, an analysis of documents obtained by The Associated Press shows.\par \par \uc2 Most receive only warnings if the I-9s turn out to be based on fraudulent documents. Some are fined. Few face arrest. And the AP analysis also shows that many of the employers the government has targeted had no violations.\par \par \uc2 "The I-9 system is deeply flawed," said Daniel Costas, an immigration policy analyst at Economic Policy Institute, a Washington, D.C., think tank. It "relies on employer eyesight for the verification of government identification and documents. ... If this is how the system is going to work, then it's a big waste of time and money."\par \par \uc2 The system is meant to thwart illegal immigrants from working in the U.S., where about 7.8 million illegal immigrants have jobs, according to a 2009 report by the Pew Hispanic Center.\par \par \uc2 But at its foundation is a law that requires a promise that employers check their workers' eligibility to work. Those forms are never submitted to the government. Employers must simply keep them on hand in case the government decides to audit the business and do a check of its workers' immigration status. All employers are required to keep the forms -- no matter the size of the business.\par \par \uc2 Whitman, the Republican hoping to become California governor Tuesday, has struggled to overcome a scandal over her forced revelation that she had an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  housekeeper for nine years. The maid was required to fill out an I-9 form when she was hired, and Whitman says she fired her last year when she learned the woman had lied on the form.\par \par \uc2 During an audit, ICE agents go through the I-9 forms and check Social Security numbers to make sure they're real, matching them against copies of other forms of ID.\par \par \uc2 Early this year, the AP asked for each of the audits conducted since the changes to the system were made. The U.S. Department of Immigration and Customs Enforcement responded just recently with limited details of a sampling of audits covering a seven-month period.\par \par \uc2 The AP reviewed summaries of 430 audits conducted between July 1, 2009, and Jan. 31, 2010.\par \par \uc2 During the seven-month period, ICE agents found 22,000 "suspect" documents among the more than 86,000 I-9s reviewed. Suspect documents mean the person's legal authorization to work in the U.S. is questionable.\par \par \uc2 ICE audited more than 200 companies with fewer than 25 employees, including 50 businesses agents listed as having fewer than five workers. More than 250 of the companies didn't have a single suspect form.\par \par \uc2 Administrative arrests, usually arrests of immigrants without the proper documentation, dropped from nearly 5,200 in the fiscal year 2008 to 765 through August of fiscal year 2010. Criminal arrests of employers rose slightly, from 135 in 2008 to 150 so far in that same time period. Criminal arrests of workers dropped from 968 to 208.\par \par \uc2 ICE officials say their I-9 audit efforts are part of a comprehensive strategy.\par \par \uc2 "We're trying to create a culture of compliance," said Brett Dreyer, the current head of ICE's work site enforcement unit. "We're using the best tool available. We believe in this work site mission as part of the entire strategy."\par \par \uc2 Dreyer said that in the mid-1990s, immigration agents would target industries known to have a significant number of illegal immigrants. Now, ICE prefers to follow investigative leads to better use their resources, he said.\par \par \uc2 But without large fines and arrests, it's hard to tell how much effect the audits are having, said Julie Myers, a former Assistant Secretary at ICE during the Bush administration.\par \par \uc2 ICE reported that it has collected more than $6.9 million in fines this year, up from $1.33 million in 2009. But some of those fines come from cases initiated in previous years, including the $1 million from \uc2 Abercrombie & Fitch\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 More than 200 companies were fined in fiscal year 2010 -- some fines were as low as a few hundred dollars. There were also examples of harsher fines. \uc2 Abercrombie & Fitch\uc2  will pay more than $1 million for failing to verify the employment eligibility of its workers in stores in Michigan, authorities announced in September, after the company agreed to have the case made public.\par \par \uc2 But most cases have gone unnoticed. For months, ICE said that it could not release the names of the companies it had audited because of a pending U.S. Supreme Court ruling. But earlier this month, ICE's legal counsel announced that the agency will be able to release the names of companies that have had a final audit order, ICE spokeswoman Gillian Brigham said.\par \par \uc2 The audits don't go unnoticed by the workers.\par \par \uc2 In September 2009, American Apparel said it laid off 1,600 workers with suspect immigration documents after the company was audited.\par \par \uc2 Peter Schey, spokesman and attorney for American Apparel, said the audits result in workers being pushed further underground. He said most workers don't leave the United States -- life here is still better than in their home countries.\par \par \uc2 Schey, along with other immigrant-rights advocates, want to see ICE conduct the audits in collaboration with the Department of Labor to hone in on employers that are violating labor laws.\par \par \uc2 "If they're hitting the right people, why would they have 250 companies in total compliance? Why would they only have arrested 135 criminal employers? They have their targets on the wrong employers," Schey said.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101101e6b1002hy\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 DENVER (AP) - Colorado's top three gubernatorial candidates agree on one thing -- this has been one of the wackiest political races in Colorado history.\par \par \uc2 Republican Dan Maes, American Constitution Party candidate Tom Tancredo, and Democrat and Denver Mayor John Hickenlooper held their final debate before the election on Friday on KCNC-TV.\par \par \uc2 Tancredo, a former GOP congressman, said he never thought he'd be within a few points of Hickenlooper after only three months in the race.\par \par \uc2 "I'm trying to figure out how to campaign against two opponents. You have to figure one campaign for this opponent and one campaign for that opponent," Tancredo said.\par \par \uc2 Maes said he was surprised by winning the caucuses, the primary and making it all the way to the general election, only to find out that the GOP state and national parties would not back him and urged him to get out of the race over character issues.\par \par \uc2 Maes has been dogged by campaign finance violations and ridiculed for his views on U.N. global warming conspiracies involving bicycles in Denver, among other gaffes. He also made questionable claims about his shadowy record as a policeman in Kansas. He refused demands that he drop out of the race and acknowledged making "rookie mistakes" on campaign finance.\par \par \uc2 Hickenlooper says his biggest problem was figuring out how to deal with his opponents after Maes beat primary opponent Scott McInnis and Tancredo jumped from the GOP to a third party.\par \par \uc2 "The strangest part for us was trying to figure out who we're running against," he said.\par \par \uc2 "It certainly has been a wacky, wild ride," said political analyst Eric Sondermann, a moderator at Friday's debate.\par \par \uc2 The three candidates defended their television ads, including a scathing ad by Tancredo that cites the case of an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who drove into a suburban Denver ice cream shop, killing a 3-year-old boy.\par \par \uc2 Tancredo has accused Hickenlooper of running a "sanctuary city" for illegal immigrants. In the ad, the boy's father asks Hickenlooper how he can sleep at night.\par \par \uc2 "That is the basic aspect of a sanctuary city. Attack ads are in the eyes of the viewers. If they don't like what they're hearing, they'll call it an attack ad," Tancredo said.\par \par \uc2 Hickenlooper said it's the "seedier underside of politics" to take a human tragedy and try to make political capital of it.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101030e6au0005g\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 GLENDALE, Calif. (AP) - Republican gubernatorial candidate Meg Whitman encountered a rowdy crowd -- some yelling "go home" -- when she stopped Friday to visit a popular Cuban pastry shop in Southern California in the final stretch of her campaign.\par \par \uc2 A noisy crowd of at least 100 swarmed Whitman while she attempted to greet customers at Porto's Bakery, famous for its guava cheese pastries and potato ball sandwiches. While some in the crowd applauded the former chief executive of \uc2 eBay\uc2 , others yelled at her.\par \par \uc2 Her detractors chanted "save our schools" and "I want my pension," a reference to Whitman's proposals to cut state spending and replace government pensions with 401(k)-style accounts. Whitman supporters responded by calling her critics "communists."\par \par \uc2 Whitman's voice was often drowned out as she tried to talk with customers, and she made no attempt to address the crowd. After the event, Whitman blamed the aggressive tone of the crowd on union-backed agitators who had arrived on a bus a few minutes before she did.\par \par \uc2 "The unions are fighting for the control that they've had on Sacramento for the last 10 or 15 years, and no one likes to give up control," she told reporters in a private room above the bakery. "If I am governor, their hand is going to be weakened."\par \par \uc2 The California Nurses Association has been following Whitman around California, staging protests and parading a character costumed as "Queen Meg" outside the Republican candidate's campaign stops. The union's bus arrived shortly before Whitman entered the pastry shop, and protesters lined the sidewalk chanting: "Hey, hey Whitman, get out of my town. All that money and you're 10 points down."\par \par \uc2 Whitman, a billionaire, has spent $142 million from her personal fortune in the race so far. A Field Poll released Thursday showed her trailing Democrat Jerry Brown 49 percent to 39 percent among likely voters.\par \par \uc2 "Polls schmolls," Whitman said. "The only poll that really matters is the poll on Election Day."\par \par \uc2 Whitman received a much warmer reception Friday afternoon before a friendly crowd of local Republicans, farmers and veterans at a packing house in Clovis, just outside the Central Valley city of Fresno. It was there the Republican candidate made the appeal to her core Republicans to vote Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 "This is going to be a close race, but the power is in your hands," Whitman told about 100 supporters gathered at P-R Farms. "Let's send a signal to the rest of the United States that the Golden State is the comeback state."\par \par \uc2 She pledged to bring jobs to the Central Valley if elected governor and said "we can turn the water back on" in five more days, a reference to water shortages that have occurred in part because of directives from federal agencies that have limited pumping from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. California's governor does not have the authority to overturn federal rules designed to protect wildlife.\par \par \uc2 Brown had no campaign events scheduled for Friday but has scheduled three days of campaigning throughout the state starting Saturday.\par \par \uc2 Betty Porto, a Whitman supporter and owner of the pastry shop in Glendale, said she was upset at the rowdiness of the event and probably lost some business that morning.\par \par \uc2 "But that's democracy," said Porto, whose family emigrated from Cuba in 1971. "If it was Cuba, they would have taken the clubs and beaten them all down."\par \par \uc2 As Whitman attempted to greet bemused diners, a man stood close to her and held up a sign supporting Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer.\par \par \uc2 Clara Ferral, a Cuban immigrant who came to the U.S. in 1968, yelled at him and called him a communist.\par \par \uc2 "It was disrespectful," said Ferral after the event, noting that she would be voting for Whitman because she feared the government was becoming too "lefty."\par \par \uc2 Porto's is located on a busy retail street in Glendale, a diverse city with large Armenian and Latino populations.\par \par \uc2 Sayed Hussaini, who works across the street in a financial services office, said he was a registered Republican but hasn't decided whom to vote for in the gubernatorial race.\par \par \uc2 "A lot of special interest groups are involved, and I don't think either of them are handling the budget deficit," he said.\par \par \uc2 Whitman has had a rough week on the campaign trail. She was booed at Maria Shriver's Women's Conference on Tuesday when she refused to agree to take down her negative campaign ads, a pledge sought during a panel by questioner Matt Lauer of NBC's Today Show. Brown accepted the challenge to cheers, although only if his rival would do the same.\par \par \uc2 Whitman then reignited a controversy over her former housekeeper by proclaiming in an interview Wednesday on Fox News that Nicky Diaz Santillan should be deported. A day later, Whitman tried to soften her comments, saying Santillan's status should be up to federal authorities.\par \par \uc2 Whitman last month admitted her former housekeeper of nine years was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Mexico, after she called on holding employers accountable for hiring illegal workers.\par \par \uc2 Despite these difficulties, Whitman said she remained confident about Tuesday's result.\par \par \uc2 "I feel the surge coming my way," she told reporters. "I am going to win this."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writer Garance Burke contributed to this report from Clovis, Calif.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101029e6at001yf\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc59}{\*\bkmkend toc59}\b \uc2 Arizona police investigate whether beheading is tied to Mexican drug smugglers\b0\par\par\uc2 By AMANDA LEE MYERS   \par \uc2 Associated Press Writer\par \uc2 1,042 \uc2 words\par \uc2 29 October 2010\par 15:26\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2010.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 CHANDLER, Ariz. (AP) - The gruesome case of a man who was stabbed and beheaded in a suburban Phoenix apartment has police investigating whether the killing is potentially the most extreme example of Mexican drug cartel violence spilling over the border.\par \par \uc2 Martin Alejandro Cota-Monroy's body was found Oct. 10 in a Chandler apartment -- his severed head a couple feet away. One man suspected in the killing has been arrested, and a manhunt is under way for three others.\par \par \uc2 Detectives are focused on whether the men belong to a Mexican drug cartel, and they suspect that Cota-Monroy's killing was punishment for stealing drugs. The brutal nature of the killing could be designed to send a message to others within the cartel.\par \par \uc2 "If it does turn out to be a drug cartel out of Mexico, typically that's a message being sent," said Chandler police Detective David Ramer. "This person was chosen to be executed. It sends a message to other people: If you cross us, this is what happens."\par \par \uc2 Decapitations are a regular part of the drug war in Mexico as cartels fight over territory. Headless bodies have been hanged from bridges by their feet, severed heads have been sent to victims' family members and government officials, and bags of up to 12 heads have been dropped off in high-profile locations.\par \par \uc2 More than 28,000 people have been killed in Mexico in drug-related violence since December 2006, when President Felipe Calderon deployed soldiers to battle the cartels in their strongholds.\par \par \uc2 If the suspects in the Arizona case belong to a cartel, the crime could be the only known beheading in the U.S. carried out by a drug cartel, said Tony Payan, a political science professor at the University of Texas at El Paso who has done extensive research about border violence.\par \par \uc2 The killing could also affect the immigration debate in Arizona. Supporters of the state's controversial immigration law frequently cite this type of violence as reason to crack down on illegal immigrants. The decapitation victim and the suspects were all illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Republican Gov. Jan Brewer drew criticism this year for claiming that headless bodies were being found in the Arizona desert as she sought to bolster her argument for immigration reform. She later backtracked on those claims, but said such violence in the broader border region is cause enough for alarm.\par \par \uc2 The killing has unnerved residents in the neighborhood and apartment complex where Cota-Monroy was killed.\par \par \uc2 The tiny, run-down complex sits along a side street across from ramshackle trailer homes in a neighborhood not far from brand-new strip malls with big-box stores in the suburb of Chandler.\par \par \uc2 No one is living inside the apartment that is the scene of the crime. There's beat-up leather furniture, a bouquet of flowers and a candle on a dining-room table, and the kitchen cabinets are ajar, as if someone left in a hurry.\par \par \uc2 "I'm terrified," said Norma Alvarado, a 47-year-old housekeeper who lives two doors down from the apartment. "I've lived here for 20 years and I've never heard of that (decapitation) happening, and it was so close to us. ... Maybe they're copying what's happening in Mexico."\par \par \uc2 Alvarado, who lives alone with her three children, said she's moving the family away from the complex out of fear that those responsible will return to the area looking for revenge.\par \par \uc2 The victim and three of the suspects had traveled to Chandler from where they were living in Perris, Calif., and were staying at a hotel. They met the two men who live in the apartment at a bar the night of the killing, and the group returned to the apartment.\par \par \uc2 The killing occurred around 5 a.m. after the men living there were out of sight, one sleeping in a bedroom and the other outside talking to his girlfriend. They stumbled upon Cota-Monroy's decapitated body and called police.\par \par \uc2 Three of the suspects had fled, but police say a fourth suspect who lived in the apartment complex went home. Crisantos Moroyoqui, 36, was found sleeping inside wearing pants covered in blood.\par \par \uc2 Shortly before the killing, Moroyoqui was heard asking Cota-Monroy: "Who are you? Who are you?" in an aggressive tone, according to a police report.\par \par \uc2 Moroyoqui was arrested and charged with second-degree murder and hindering prosecution. He pleaded not guilty on Wednesday and has refused to speak to police. He declined to speak with The Associated Press.\par \par \uc2 The other suspects have been identified as Jose David Castro Reyes, 25; Isai Aguilar Morales, 22, and a man between the ages of 20 and 27 only known by the nickname "El Joto," a derogatory Spanish term for a gay man.\par \par \uc2 They are believed to have fled to Mexico, making it very difficult to locate them.\par \par \uc2 While extreme violence has stayed south of the border for the most part, some of it has spilled over into the U.S.\par \par \uc2 In March, Arizona rancher Robert Krentz was gunned down while checking water lines on his property near the border. Authorities believe -- but have never produced substantive proof -- that an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , likely a scout for drug smugglers, was to blame for his killing.\par \par \uc2 In May 2009, a Mexican drug cartel lieutenant who became an informant for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement was shot eight times outside his pricey home in El Paso. The lieutenant, Jose Daniel Gonzalez Galeana, was living in Texas on a visa that ICE gave him, and is believed to be the first ranking cartel member killed in the U.S.\par \par \uc2 Payan described the spillover as minimal, but said it could increase.\par \par \uc2 "The cartels warring in Mexico have operatives in Phoenix, and it is possible they may go after each other in places like that," he said, but added that cartels are very unlikely to target the general American population. "Our law enforcement agencies and intelligence agencies have shown a high degree of competence. In Mexico, they're nowhere near that level."\par \par \uc2 (This version CORRECTS to Perris, Calif., instead of Paris, in 15th paragraph.)\par \par \uc2 5\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101029e6at0012x\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc61}{\*\bkmkend toc61}\b \uc2 Poll: Brown keeps lead over Whitman in Calif. governor's race less than week a before election\b0\par\par\uc2 By SAMANTHA YOUNG   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 671 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 October 2010\par 20:03\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2010.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) - Democrat Jerry Brown holds a double-digit lead over Republican Meg Whitman in their contest for California governor less than a week before Election Day, according to a Field Poll released Thursday.\par \par \uc2 The survey found the former two-term governor leading the former \uc2 eBay\uc2  chief executive 49 percent to 39 percent among likely voters. It is the third poll released in the past week showing Brown leading a race considered too close to call a month ago.\par \par \uc2 "I don't remember anything in recent memory, going back 50 years, a candidate riding this low in the polls overtaking and winning," this close to an election, said Jaime Regalado, executive director of the Pat Brown Institute of Public Affairs at California State University, Los Angeles.\par \par \uc2 That doesn't bode well for Whitman, a billionaire who has spent nearly $142 million of her own money in her first bid for political office. She has spent the past two weeks traveling California in a bid to woo the independent voters she needs to win in a state where Democrats hold a 13-point registration advantage.\par \par \uc2 At a campaign stop Thursday in the blue-collar Central Valley city of Stockton, Whitman urged attendees to contact everyone they know to get out the vote.\par \par \uc2 "This is going to be a tight race. I need your support," she told the crowd of about 75 employees at the JM Eagle plastic pipe manufacturing plant.\par \par \uc2 Whitman brushed off the Field Poll results, saying that her campaign's "internal polls -- the polls I believe -- show we're in a dead heat, and we're gaining momentum every single day."\par \par \uc2 Brown appears to be gaining favor among undecided voters, who in previous polls made up about a fifth of likely voters. Thursday's poll shows 12 percent remain undecided.\par \par \uc2 "What we've known in the history of elections, politics and campaigns is that undecided voters like to see where momentum is going and then they are likely to jump on the bandwagon," Regalado said. "Simply by looking at the polls, Jerry has to be happy and Meg has to be worried."\par \par \uc2 Just a month ago, Brown and Whitman were tied after a summer of intense advertising and campaigning by Whitman. Brown began advertising over the Labor Day weekend.\par \par \uc2 The general election campaign for governor has become the most expensive in the state's history, according to the California Fair Political Practices Commission.\par \par \uc2 The candidates have met in three debates this fall, and each dealt with controversies that temporarily overshadowed their campaigns. Whitman was forced to admit that her former housekeeper of nine years was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Mexico, after she called on holding employers accountable for hiring illegal workers. Whitman says she fired Nicky Diaz Santillan last year when she learned Santillan was in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, a female Brown campaign aide was overheard on a leaked audio tape calling Whitman a "whore" for cutting a deal with a police union for its endorsement. Brown apologized for the remark but continued to attack his rival for bowing to union pressure.\par \par \uc2 The Field Poll indicates Brown has shored up his support among women and Latinos, traditionally Democratic-leaning constituencies that Whitman has aggressively targeted. Latinos are supporting Brown, the state attorney general, 57 percent to 27 percent, while women support him 51 percent to 35 percent.\par \par \uc2 Of the likely voters interviewed, 21 percent have already cast their ballots -- 48 percent in favor of Brown and 41 percent in support of Whitman. An estimated 55 percent of likely voters are expected to cast their ballots by mail, a record high percentage for a general election in California.\par \par \uc2 The poll surveyed 1,092 likely voters by telephone from Oct. 14-26.

(AP) - Republican gubernatorial candidate Meg Whitman told a television host that her former housekeeper, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , should be deported, but then stepped away from the comment during a campaign stop Thursday.\par \par \uc2 Appearing on the Greta Van Susteren show on Fox News Wednesday night, Whitman said her former Mexican housekeeper of nine years, Nicky Diaz Santillan, should be deported for forging documents and lying about her immigration status.\par \par \uc2 "It breaks my heart, but she should be deported because she forged documents and she lied about her immigration status," Whitman said.\par \par \uc2 "The law's the law and we live in a rule of law, it's important."\par \par \uc2 When asked about the comment during a campaign stop in Stockton on Thursday, Whitman returned to her previous stance, saying the decision is up to federal authorities.\par \par \uc2 "She is here illegally. She's breaking the law right now, so we'll leave it for the federal authorities," Whitman said.\par \par \uc2 Whitman says she fired Diaz Santillan in June 2009 after learning she was working illegally.\par \par \uc2 Diaz Santillan upended the governor's race when she appeared at a news conference last month with celebrity attorney Gloria Allred, saying that Whitman and her husband, Griffith Harsh IV, should have known that she was illegal.\par \par \uc2 Whitman says Diaz Santillan used a fraudulently obtained Social Security card and California driver's license when she applied for the job through an employment agency.\par \par \uc2 Diaz Santillan's immigration attorney, Mark Van Der Hout, did not immediately return a message left at his San Francisco office Thursday.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101028e6as0026t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

PAULSON   \par \uc2 Associated Press Writer\par \uc2 843 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 October 2010\par 19:04\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2010.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 DENVER (AP) - Tom Tancredo is quick to admit he brings plenty of baggage to the Colorado governor's race.\par \par \uc2 Like the time he called Miami a "Third World country." Or when he got thrown out of the White House for suggesting then-President George W. Bush was soft on illegal immigration. Or when he refused to take part in a presidential debate because it was on a Spanish-language network.\par \par \uc2 This week, he added more fuel to the fire when he said President Barack Obama is a bigger threat to the United States than al-Qaida or terrorism.\par \par \uc2 But despite all the baggage, the immigration hard-liner is running a solid campaign for governor as a third-party candidate and is within the margin of error in several recent polls.\par \par \uc2 Tancredo has successfully courted tea party groups, capitalized on anti-incumbent anger and parlayed his trademark blunt talk on the issues to become the de facto Republican candidate. Tancredo has also taken advantage of the collapse of GOP nominee Dan Maes, who is polling in single digits amid a series of character issues and campaign gaffes.\par \par \uc2 Tancredo is a former Republican lawmaker who left Congress in 2008 to mount a longshot White House bid that was largely based on an anti-immigration platform. He quit the GOP this year after saying that the Republicans in the governor's race couldn't win.\par \par \uc2 He got on the ballot as the American Constitution Party candidate -- and has been surging in the polls ever since.\par \par \uc2 Democrat John Hickenlooper, the popular mayor of Denver, remains the favorite and a formidable candidate given his fundraising lead, but he has never made it above 50 percent in most polls.\par \par \uc2 The Canon City Daily Record reported that Tancredo told a coffee shop crowd Tuesday that Obama posed a threat to the Constitution, saying: "It's not al-Qaida, it's the guy sitting in the White House."\par \par \uc2 Tancredo also said he believes Obama and Hickenlooper are "kindred spirits."\par \par \uc2 Tancredo has said Hickenlooper, a former brewpub owner, raised taxes by $290 million in Denver. He also criticized the Denver mayor for opposing state laws on illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 "I'm fed up with elitist politicians who trash our values and jeopardize our economic future," Tancredo said.\par \par \uc2 Although he refuses to attack Tancredo personally, Hickenlooper has sought to portray Tancredo's policies as radical, including proposals to cut government regulation on issues such as oil and gas drilling.\par \par \uc2 "We need predictability, not volatility," Hickenlooper said.\par \par \uc2 Tancredo, who frequently rides around on a \uc2 Harley-Davidson\uc2 , recently suggested that drivers on the main east-west highway in Colorado pay tolls -- an idea that flies in the face of his low-tax mantra.\par \par \uc2 Tancredo also drew gasps from a business crowd when he apologized during a speech if their lunch was cold. He joked that half the wait and kitchen staff usually leaves when he walks into a room because of his immigration stance.\par \par \uc2 Tancredo owes his rise to several bizarre developments involving the Republican candidates in the race.\par \par \uc2 Former Rep. Scott McInnis was favored to win the primary, but became engulfed in a plagiarism scandal and lost to Maes. Maes then became dogged by campaign finance violations and ridiculed for his views on U.N. global warming conspiracies involving bicycles in Denver, among other gaffes. He also made questionable claims about his shadowy record as a policeman in Kansas.\par \par \uc2 Tancredo swooped in and focused on his signature issue: immigration.\par \par \uc2 He repeatedly accuses Hickenlooper of running a "sanctuary city" in Denver. One unsavory Tancredo ad cites the case of an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who drove into a suburban Denver ice cream shop, killing a 3-year-old boy. The boy's father asks Hickenlooper how he can sleep at night.\par \par \uc2 Tancredo promises to sign an Arizona-style law that requires police to check immigration status. Hickenlooper vows to veto it. Tancredo wants to require proof of citizenship to enroll in public schools. Hickenlooper opposes it. Tancredo wants limits on federal stimulus spending. Hickenlooper supports more federal spending and points to federal money providing broadband to rural areas.\par \par \uc2 Tancredo appeals to voters like Frank DeFilippo, a registered Republican. He said this year's gubernatorial race has been "the craziest I've ever seen," resulting in odd political alliances.\par \par \uc2 "I don't feel I'm violating my Republican loyalties, I support other Republican candidates," he said.\par \par \uc2 Proof of Tancredo's resurgence came with the last financial reports, when he collected $220,000 -- 10 times more than Maes -- for a total $304,000. Tancredo said much of his support comes from opponents of illegal immigration across the nation.\par \par \uc2 Hickenlooper raised $387,000 from Sept. 30 to Oct. 13, bringing his total to $3.7 million.\par \par \uc2 Tancredo spokesman Cliff Dodge said anything can happen in a three-way race.\par \par \uc2 "Now we have Tom and Hickenlooper neck and neck and we've got a horse race," Dodge said.\par \par \uc2 "So much for baggage."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101028e6as001t8\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc64}{\*\bkmkend toc64}\b \uc2 Poll: Brown keeps lead over Whitman in Calif. governor's race less than week a before election\b0\par\par\uc2 By SAMANTHA YOUNG   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 621 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 October 2010\par 15:25\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2010.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) - Democrat Jerry Brown holds a double-digit lead over Republican Meg Whitman in their contest for California governor less than a week before Election Day, according to a Field Poll released Thursday.\par \par \uc2 The survey found the former two-term governor leading the former \uc2 eBay\uc2  chief executive 49 percent to 39 percent among likely voters. It is the third poll released in the past week showing Brown leading a race considered too close to call a month ago.\par \par \uc2 "I don't remember anything in recent memory, going back 50 years, a candidate riding this low in the polls overtaking and winning," this close to an election, said Jaime Regalado, executive director of the Pat Brown Institute of Public Affairs at California State University, Los Angeles.\par \par \uc2 That doesn't bode well for Whitman, a billionaire who has spent nearly $142 million of her own money in her first bid for political office. She has spent the past two weeks traveling California in a bid to woo the independent voters she needs to win in a state where Democrats hold a 13-point registration advantage.\par \par \uc2 At a campaign stop Thursday morning in the agriculture hub of Salinas, in Monterey County, Whitman urged supporters to contact everyone they know to get out the vote.\par \par \uc2 "It's going to be a close race. We need every single vote," she said, according to The Salinas Californian newspaper.\par \par \uc2 Brown appears to be gaining favor among undecided voters, who in previous polls made up about a fifth of likely voters. Thursday's poll shows 12 percent remain undecided.\par \par \uc2 "What we've known in the history of elections, politics and campaigns is that undecided voters like to see where momentum is going and then they are likely to jump on the bandwagon," Regalado said. "Simply by looking at the polls, Jerry has to be happy and Meg has to be worried."\par \par \uc2 Just a month ago, Brown and Whitman were tied after a summer of intense advertising and campaigning by Whitman. Brown began advertising over the Labor Day weekend.\par \par \uc2 The general election campaign for governor has become the most expensive in the state's history, according to the California Fair Political Practices Commission.\par \par \uc2 The candidates have met in three debates this fall, and each dealt with controversies that temporarily overshadowed their campaigns. Whitman was forced to admit that her former housekeeper of nine years was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Mexico, after she called on holding employers accountable for hiring illegal workers. Whitman says she fired Nicky Diaz Santillan last year when she learned Santillan was in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, a female Brown campaign aide was overheard on a leaked audio tape calling Whitman a "whore" for cutting a deal with a police union for its endorsement. Brown apologized for the remark but continued to attack his rival for bowing to union pressure.\par \par \uc2 The Field Poll indicates Brown has shored up his support among women and Latinos, traditionally Democratic-leaning constituencies that Whitman has aggressively targeted. Latinos are supporting Brown, the state attorney general, 57 percent to 27 percent, while women support him 51 percent to 35 percent.\par \par \uc2 Of the likely voters interviewed, 21 percent have already cast their ballots -- 48 percent in favor of Brown and 41 percent in support of Whitman. An estimated 55 percent of likely voters are expected to cast their ballots by mail, a record high percentage for a general election in California.\par \par \uc2 The poll surveyed 1,092 likely voters by telephone from Oct. 14-26. It has a sampling error margin of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101028e6as000yx\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc66}{\*\bkmkend toc66}\b \uc2 On the air and everywhere else, Calif. gubernatorial candidate Whitman puts millions into race\b0\par\par\uc2 By MICHAEL R. BLOOD   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 1,184 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 October 2010\par 15:37\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2010.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PASADENA, Calif. (AP) - It's hard to turn off Meg Whitman. The most expensive campaign for governor in U.S. history -- about $162 million and counting -- is inundating California voters with an unprecedented array of TV and radio ads, glossy magazines, smartphone messages, \uc2 Facebook\uc2  videos, postcards and phone calls that will test how far a Republican dollar can go in a state Democrats often dominate.\par \par \uc2 A typical TV viewer in Los Angeles will see 23 of her commercials this week alone, many roughing up Democrat Jerry Brown, according to Democrats tracking her ad buys. The story of the Silicon Valley billionaire is being told in four languages -- English, Spanish, Mandarin and Cantonese. There are book-like mailers, billboards and text messages reaching voters and supporters, all while she's jetting to appearances across the state.\par \par \uc2 It costs about $3 million for a candidate to blanket California with TV ads for one week, but from October 10-17 her campaign spent $4.6 million, underscoring the urgency of the effort and pushing her message from Spanish-speaking households near Los Angeles to rural areas on the Oregon border.\par \par \uc2 Still, it might not be enough. Brown, after being outspent 6-1 through mid-October, opened up a slight edge in recent polls. Even Whitman appeared to concede last week that many voters in the economically battered state -- unemployment is 12.4 percent -- don't know her.\par \par \uc2 "People need to see me. They see me on TV. They see me on the Internet. But they haven't seen me in real life," Whitman said in Los Angeles. "I want people to know I care."\par \par \uc2 At an appearance Tuesday in Long Beach, Brown said he would take down his negative TV ads if Whitman agreed to do the same. His ads, laced with unflattering photographs of his rival, pound Whitman for her spotty voting record and employing an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  as a housekeeper. (Whitman says the maid used a fraudulently obtained Social Security card and California driver's license; she fired her after learning of her illegal status.)\par \par \uc2 Responding to Brown's challenge, Whitman said she would continue to run ads on Brown's record as governor from 1975 to 1983. "I want to make sure that people really understand what's going on here," she said.\par \par \uc2 In TV ads, Whitman warns that Brown's election will mean the status quo in Sacramento, something voters can't afford. "Just a dishonest politician, trying to hide his record of failure," one ad says. "Job killer, Jerry Brown."\par \par \uc2 The record spending has been going on for months and stands out strikingly in a state facing a budget crisis that will demand austerity for years to come. Outgoing Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who has stayed quiet in the campaign, will leave behind a multibillion-dollar deficit for his successor.\par \par \uc2 A first-time candidate, Whitman, \uc2 eBay\uc2 's former chief executive, has invested $142 million of her Internet fortune so far, most of it for ads to introduce her to the state's 17 million voters and help overcome a 13-point Democratic edge in registration. She's raised about $30 million from other sources.\par \par \uc2 The Silicon Valley billionaire has already spent more money than Al Gore used for his 2000 presidential campaign. In the first two weeks of October, her operation burned through an average of $1.4 million a day.\par \par \uc2 Whitman spokesman Tucker Bounds, who would not discuss details of the campaign's ad spending, argued that labor unions and Brown have together funded an equal level of ads in Southern California. "It's like Meg is dueling with multiple gunmen," Bounds said.\par \par \uc2 TV is viewed as the only practical way for candidates to become known across the sprawling state. The reach of Whitman's ads can be seen in figures compiled by Democrats: Most of the $4.6 million she spent Oct. 11-17 went to broadcast television reaching every corner of the state, but she also pumped $275,000 into Spanish-language ads in 10 cities, including Fresno, Bakersfield and Santa Barbara, and sent $560,000 to cable TV stations.\par \par \uc2 Many voters wince at the deluge of candidate ads as Election Day nears, but not everyone is turning the channel.\par \par \uc2 If a billionaire, "I would put in $150 million," says Jeff Gendler, 65, a conservative Los Angeles sales manager who plans to vote for Whitman -- somewhat uneasily, because he considers her too moderate. As for her ads, "I have no problem with that," he says.\par \par \uc2 In a year when some candidates are avoiding the media, Whitman is rushing to be seen in the campaign's final days. On Monday, she was in Indio, near Palm Springs, and in suburban Los Angeles. On Tuesday, she appeared in Long Beach. On Wednesday, she made several stops in Southern California, including San Diego and Riverside.\par \par \uc2 Her supporters can use smartphones to get "exclusive" photos and video and "keep in touch" with Whitman through \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and Twitter. She recently sent a color, book-like mailer to independent voters in Los Angeles, written in the first person. "You get to know who someone really is when you learn their story and discover what has made them who they are," it says.\par \par \uc2 Weeks ago she eclipsed the record for personal spending set by another billionaire, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who spent $109 million in 2009.\par \par \uc2 Yet she could join other wealthy candidates whose dollars didn't translate into victory. In his failed 1992 presidential race, Ross Perot spent $63.5 million of his own money. In California, Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein was re-elected in 1994 after being outspent 2-1 by Republican Michael Huffington, who used $28 million from his own wallet.\par \par \uc2 In a year of runaway political spending, California could be a lesson in its limitations. Republican Carly Fiorina, a former \uc2 Hewlett-Packard\uc2  chief executive, loaned her campaign $1 million last week, raising her contributions this year to $6.5 million in her bid to oust Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer.\par \par \uc2 Whitman can spend as much of her personal fortune as she wishes. But Brown and other candidates who rely on donations must comply with fundraising caps that make it difficult, if not impossible, to keep pace. The maximum donation to a candidate for governor is $25,900 for the primary election and that amount again for the general election.\par \par \uc2 Whitman says the record-level spending is needed to offset the influence of public employee unions, which have spent some $20 million on Brown's behalf. Her public appearances have been hounded by union activists, who have accused her of trying to buy the election.\par \par \uc2 "I'm up against some pretty big entrenched interests," Whitman has said. "My job is to spend money to get out this message."\par \par \uc2 However, her torrent of spending has started talk about expanding those limits for statewide candidates.\par \par \uc2 "We are starving the candidates to death," says Democratic consultant Garry South, "and shifting the balance of power."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101028e6as000jj\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SAN DIEGO (AP) - California GOP gubernatorial candidate Meg Whitman said Wednesday that she has no second thoughts about airing attack ads during the final week of her campaign, a day after she was booed for refusing a truce in the increasingly negative campaign.\par \par \uc2 Whitman said she would continue to highlight Democrat Jerry Brown's record as governor from 1975 to 1983 and as mayor of Oakland from 1998 to 2006, echoing her remarks a day earlier at a joint appearance with her rival.\par \par \uc2 "What I said yesterday is, Californians need to have a choice in this election, they need to understand Jerry Brown's record versus mine, Jerry Brown's lack of a plan for California versus my very specific plan," she told reporters Wednesday. "I wouldn't have handled it any differently."\par \par \uc2 "Today" show host Matt Lauer asked the candidates Tuesday at California first lady Maria Shriver's annual women's conference in Long Beach if they would agree to pull negative ads. Many in the audience booed when Whitman demurred after Brown accepted the challenge.\par \par \uc2 Whitman insisted her ads about Brown focus on his record in office, not personal attacks that she says he has used against her.\par \par \uc2 "He and his campaign have called me a whore, they have called me a liar, they have called me a Nazi, so it's been a very ugly campaign," she said.\par \par \uc2 Last summer, when Brown chatted with a radio reporter he met on a jogging path, he compared Whitman's advertising campaign to Nazi propaganda in a conversation he thought was off the record. He apologized after the comments appeared on the station's blog.\par \par \uc2 In a recording that surfaced this month, a female Brown campaign aide overheard on a leaked audio tape called Whitman a "whore" for cutting a deal with a police union for its endorsement.\par \par \uc2 Brown on Wednesday renewed his call for a truce on negative advertising and said all third parties and independent expenditure groups should abide by any agreement that the candidates reach.\par \par \uc2 "Just as I did yesterday, I am pledging again today to run only positive ads through Election Day if my opponent agrees to do the same," Brown said. "Meg Whitman has now had a full day to consult with her image makers and political handlers, and it's time for each of us to put our best foot forward and end this campaign on a high note."\par \par \uc2 His campaign then released a new 30-second ad featuring clips from Tuesday's event, ending with the audience boos and the message "Tell Meg Whitman: Let's Get Positive."\par \par \uc2 Whitman's campaign unveiled a positive spot featuring upbeat music, images of California sand and surf and soft-focus pictures of Whitman shaking hands and hugging babies.\par \par \uc2 Going all positive is an easier gamble for Brown, though, as polls show him leading the race.\par \par \uc2 Whitman has spent $142 million of her personal fortune on her $162 million campaign -- most of it blanketing the airwaves with TV spots in a race that has featured dozens of attack ads on both sides.\par \par \uc2 Brown's campaign has tried to undermine Whitman's character with ads that included references to Whitman's forced admission last month that her former housekeeper of nine years was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Mexico, and attacked her corporate record and her proposal to eliminate the capital gains tax.\par \par \uc2 The Democrat has also benefited from nearly $24 million in union-backed independent expenditure spending. One of the groups, the California Labor Federation, released an ad Tuesday highlighting Whitman's failure to vote for most of her adult life.\par \par \uc2 Whitman's campaign also has aggressively attacked Brown in TV ads, including some that distort his record and position on the death penalty, education reform and his records as mayor of Oakland and as governor. Whitman's campaign has used selected facts to inflate unemployment, spending and taxes during Brown's tenure.\par \par \uc2 Whitman stumped Wednesday at the San Diego warehouse of Sneaks Kicks, a small business that got its start by selling sneakers through \uc2 eBay Inc\uc2 ., the online marketplace operator that Whitman led.\par \par \uc2 "We have polls that show a very close race," Whitman told the audience of about 50 people. "Some polls I'm actually up. Some polls I'm down one or two points. We are going to win this."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 AP writer Juliet Williams in Sacramento also contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101027e6ar001v8\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) - California gubernatorial candidates Meg Whitman and Jerry Brown were placed on the hot seat during a joint appearance at a women's conference Tuesday when they were asked to pull their attack advertising a week before Election Day.\par \par \uc2 The campaign has grown increasing caustic over the past month, with negative ads constantly filling television screens throughout the state.\par \par \uc2 Brown, the Democrat, said he would agree to air only an ad in which he talks directly to the camera about his plans to lead the state -- if Whitman, the Republican, agreed to do the same.\par \par \uc2 "Let's be clear, if she takes her negative ads down ... I'll take mine off, no question. We'll do it together," he said to loud applause.\par \par \uc2 Whitman demurred.\par \par \uc2 "Here's what I'll do: I will take down any ads that could even remotely be construed as a personal attack. But I don't think we can take down the ads that talk about where Governor Brown stands on the issues," she said.\par \par \uc2 Whitman said she needs to tell Californians about Brown's record as governor from 1975 to 1983 -- and she then proceeded to attack it.\par \par \uc2 "People need to know where I stand. And also Jerry Brown has been in politics for 40 years and there's a long track record there. And I want to make sure that people really understand what's going on here. And I'm not doing it in a mean-spirited way," she said.\par \par \uc2 Her answer prompted loud boos from the largely female audience at first lady Maria Shriver's annual women's conference. At times, the audience response drowned out the candidates, who were being questioned by "Today" show host Matt Lauer about the negative tone of the race.\par \par \uc2 Lauer played moderator in a conversation between the candidates and outgoing Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, and initially, the crowd appeared to be on Whitman's side, cheering loudly for her when she appeared.\par \par \uc2 Schwarzenegger was seated onstage between the two candidates and grinned widely during much of the sometimes awkward exchange over whether the candidates would agree to pull their negative ads. The Republican governor declined to endorse either candidate.\par \par \uc2 Lauer's call for a truce received sustained applause from the crowd, and he was forced to reiterate it after first receiving noncommittal responses.\par \par \uc2 Brown initially parsed his answer, saying that "sometimes negativity is in the eye of the beholder," but then reversed course when the crowd booed.\par \par \uc2 Whitman, a billionaire who has spent $142 million of her personal fortune on her race -- most of it blanketing the airwaves with TV spots -- first talked about the negative race without making a pledge.\par \par \uc2 "What I have found very challenging, and I'll be honest about it, are the personal attacks. The things that I have been called in this campaign -- it's not fair to the voters of California," she said.\par \par \uc2 That comment was likely a reference to a leaked recording of a private conversation in which a Brown campaign aide called Whitman a "whore" for allegedly cutting a pension deal with law enforcement unions to get their endorsement. The recording surfaced after Whitman struggled to overcome a scandal over her forced revelation that she had an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  housekeeper for nine years, who she says she fired last year when she learned the maid was illegal.\par \par \uc2 Brown's campaign exploited that incident shortly afterward in an attack ad that features an image of a lie detector test.\par \par \uc2 "Meg Whitman didn't tell the truth about not voting or about how long she lived in California. She got caught in insider deals at \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2 . She changed her story about physically abusing an employee. She campaigned as tough as nails on immigration knowing her housekeeper of nine years was undocumented," it says in part.\par \par \uc2 Brown's campaign has also attacked Whitman's corporate record and her proposal eliminate the capital gains tax, which it said would "rip a hole in the state budget."\par \par \uc2 Whitman's campaign has also aggressively attacked Brown in TV ads, including some that distort his record and position on the death penalty, education reform and his records as mayor of Oakland and as governor. Whitman's campaign has used selected facts to inflate unemployment, spending and taxes during Brown's tenure.\par \par \uc2 While Whitman has vastly outspent Brown during the campaign, the Democrat has been buoyed in recent weeks by nearly $24 million in spending from union-backed independent expenditure committees, largely for negative advertising.\par \par \uc2 Brown's campaign reiterated his pledge to pull all negative ads later Tuesday, while Whitman's campaign issued a statement calling on Brown to campaign on the issues.\par \par \uc2 "Our campaign is going to continue to advertise Meg's positive vision for California, while also running fair and truthful ads that highlight Jerry Brown's long record on the issues," spokeswoman Sarah Pompei said in the statement.\par \par \uc2 After three previous debates, Tuesday's event was the candidates' last appearance together before the Nov. 2 election.\par \par \uc2 Schwarzenegger praised both candidates during the conversation but was most effusive in describing Brown's decades of public service. He also criticized Whitman for saying California can be a golden state again, saying "California IS a golden state."\par \par \uc2 Schwarzenegger and Brown later left the stage area together.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101027e6ar0001o\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) - The candidates competing in New Hampshire's 2nd Congressional District sparred in a wide-ranging televised debate Tuesday over such subjects as gays in the military, immigration -- even each other's campaign ads.\par \par \uc2 When asked whether gays should openly serve in the military, Republican Charlie Bass said the decision needs to be made in the field by troop commanders, not in Washington during an election year.\par \par \uc2 "This decision is not about politics," Bass said, as he and Democratic challenger Ann McLane Kuster faced off at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at Saint Anselm College.\par \par \uc2 The federal government has appealed a U.S. District judge's order halting the military's "don't ask, don't tell" policy, and an appeals court temporarily blocked the order.\par \par \uc2 Bass said he would support a decision to eliminate "don't ask, don't tell" if the commanders support it.\par \par \uc2 Kuster said Congress should work with the military on the matter. But she suggested she supports eliminating the policy, asking: "How can we ask someone to give up their lives for this country and not recognize their personal values and personal beliefs?"\par \par \uc2 On immigration, the discussion turned to Arizona's controversial law regarding illegal immigrants. Kuster said Arizona's law is unconstitutional. She said the attorney general's office tried to make a film for the police to enforce the law. "It can't be done without arbitrary decisions," she said, asking how would police know by checking to find out if someone is "a potential \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  or the governor of New Mexico?"\par \par \uc2 Bass said he doesn't blame Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer for trying to enforce it.\par \par \uc2 Kuster said she supports a legal path to citizenship that would focus on measures targeting employers who want illegal immigrants to come into the country.\par \par \uc2 "'Legal path to citizenship' means allowing illegals in this country to become citizens without leaving the country. That is amnesty," Bass said. Kuster disagreed, saying he misrepresented her comments.\par \par \uc2 The two were asked to critique specific ads aimed at their campaigns. Responding to one accusing her of wanting to grow the deficit, Kuster said: "I don't understand any of the ads comparing me to members of Congress already there. I'm not in the Congress."\par \par \uc2 She criticized Bass, who held the 2nd District seat for six terms until he lost in 2006 to Democrat Paul Hodes. "He voted for earmarks, he voted for deficits, he voted for spending that went wildly out of control," she said.\par \par \uc2 Bass described his campaign's ad as accurate. "The Democrats have had 20 months to make a difference in this economic crisis we have today."\par \par \uc2 The anti-Bass ad focused on a comment he made at the pair's prior debate, in which Bass cited research saying "For every single job that is outsourced in America, two new jobs are created."\par \par \uc2 "No outsourcing is ever good," Bass responded, saying he never supported it. He said, however, it isn't always possible to avoid, and noted that New Hampshire produced $3.1 billion in exports in 2009 and jobs supporting them. "The alternative my opponent supports is protectionism, trade isolation," he said.\par \par \uc2 "I'll just let the ad speak for itself, and Charlie's own words," Kuster said. "Congressman Bass voted for tax breaks that sent jobs overseas."\par \par \uc2 The candidates also were allowed to ask each other questions. Bass asked Kuster if she would vote to support Nancy Pelosi in January if Kuster is elected to Congress.\par \par \uc2 "I don't know, honestly, at this point," she said. "The truth is that's not what I'm focused on. I'm focused here on solving problems."\par \par \uc2 Kuster asked Bass if he planned to attend an upcoming rally by Sarah Palin's "Tea Party Express" in New Hampshire, given that he once said its agenda was the same as his. Kuster said that meant ending the Department of Energy and Social Security.\par \par \uc2 Bass said he hoped to attend the rally, to the extent the tea party movement has been about reducing taxes, spending and saving government "for my children and your children."\par \par \uc2 "Would you end Social Security?" Kuster asked.\par \par \uc2 "Of course not," Bass replied.\par \par \uc2 The debate was sponsored by WMUR-TV and the New Hampshire Union Leader.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101027e6ar0001l\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc72}{\*\bkmkend toc72}\b \uc2 Whether representing the outrageous or unfortunate, Gloria Allred always commands attention\b0\par\par\uc2 By JOHN ROGERS    \par \uc2 Associated Press Writer\par \uc2 1,472 \uc2 words\par \uc2 26 October 2010\par 00:00\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2010.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.    \par \par \uc2 LOS ANGELES (AP) - She's been called an ambulance chaser, an opportunist, a made-for-TV attorney and a shameless publicity hound.\par \par \uc2 And, Gloria Allred will tell you with a smile, those are just some of the nicer names people use to describe her.\par \par \uc2 Meg Whitman, for example, is not a fan. Allred turned this year's race for California governor upside down by stepping before the TV cameras to reveal that the Republican candidate employed an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  as a maid for nine years.\par \par \uc2 Although the message from the unabashedly liberal Allred knocked the conservative Whitman off message for a few days, it also led to an inevitable round of Allred bashing. She was lampooned by "Saturday Night Live's" Nasim Pedrad as an annoying loudmouth. Jay Leno told his "Tonight Show" audience, "How 'bout we let the maid stay, we deport Gloria Allred?"\par \par \uc2 But Allred is comfortable with controversy. Indeed, if there has been a divisive or offbeat -- or sometimes both -- cause to support over the past 35 years, Allred was there.\par \par \uc2 She once handed a California legislator a chastity belt at a public hearing he called to seek a ban on abortion. She tried to put former "Seinfeld" co-star Michael Richards on the witness stand at a mock trial after he shouted the N-word at black nightclub patrons who didn't think he was funny. When "Late Show" host David Letterman admitted to sexual liaisons with some of his staff, a smirking Allred held up a big sign for the cameras: "David Letterman, Just Say No to Sex in Your Workplace."\par \par \uc2 There is, however, another side of Allred.\par \par \uc2 In February, a few days after loudly demanding that Tiger Woods apologize to porn actress Joslyn James for cheating on James while he was cheating on his wife with James, Allred quietly entered a New York courthouse on behalf of the family of Megan Wright, a young woman who committed suicide after reporting she was gang raped in a dorm at Dominican College.\par \par \uc2 The suit, scheduled to come to trial next year, has already been credited with prompting an investigation by New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo, who concluded the school was underreporting campus crime statistics.\par \par \uc2 So which is the real Allred?\par \par \uc2 The bombastic publicity seeker who went on television to hector authorities to investigate the late Michael Jackson's parenting skills? (Jackson himself told her to "go to hell.")\par \par \uc2 Or the one who won a $15 million settlement with \uc2 Circuit City\uc2  two years ago for 217 workers who said they were fired for being too old?\par \par \uc2 Is it the one who sued a condominium board for telling a woman to quit kissing her boyfriend in her driveway, or the one who persuaded a jury to award more than $18 million to a man who said he was fired for reporting his female boss had sexually harassed him?\par \par \uc2 To Allred, they are one and the same.\par \par \uc2 "I don't regret any of the cases I've taken on," says the attorney, dressed in a pinstriped pantsuit with a turtleneck top and pink jacket as she sits in the conference room of her law firm's spacious 15th-floor office. To her back is a stunning panorama of Los Angeles, stretching from downtown to the Hollywood sign.\par \par \uc2 "I'm not a politician. I don't put my finger in the wind to try to determine which way it is blowing, to try to curry favor with the public. I do what I believe is right," Allred insists.\par \par \uc2 Meticulous attorney that she is, Allred has come well prepared for an interview that will last nearly three hours. She is toting a thick stack of files on civil rights cases in which she has prevailed, including a $1.7 million settlement she won for six poor migrant farmworkers who said they were denied employment because they were women.\par \par \uc2 It was not quite the headline-grabbing case Allred took on earlier this year when she persuaded the federal Transportation Security Administration to change the way it screens airline passengers after one of them was handed a pair of pliers and told to remove her nipple rings.\par \par \uc2 But Allred sees a common thread running through those and all her other cases: Always, she says, she defends the powerless.\par \par \uc2 In the process, she has become arguably the most recognized civil rights attorney in the country.\par \par \uc2 "She's generally treated like a rock star by the average person when you walk down the street with her," laughs Allred's daughter, Lisa Bloom, a well-known attorney in her own right and a legal analyst for CBS News and CNN. "Women especially, and older women especially, will often come up and say, 'Thank you for being an inspiration.'"\par \par \uc2 Those who have been on the other end of an Allred assault likely feel differently, although it's hard to find any who will say a bad word publicly about her.\par \par \uc2 "She is not somebody I would want mad at me," says Hollywood publicist Michael Levine who has represented Jackson and others who have run afoul of Allred. "She is unrelenting and ferocious."\par \par \uc2 But Levine also says he counts Allred as a friend, as does criminal defense attorney Mark Geragos, who tangled with her when he represented Scott Peterson, a California man convicted of killing his pregnant wife, Laci, in 2002 and dumping her body in San Francisco Bay. Allred represented Peterson's mistress, Amber Frey, whose testimony helped convict Peterson in court while Allred lambasted him on TV during his trial.\par \par \uc2 "Personally, I think the world of her," Geragos says of Allred. "She's a tenacious advocate."\par \par \uc2 Allred was just six years out of law school when she caught the public's attention at a 1981 state Senate committee hearing where she gave the late Sen. John Schmitz the chastity belt. He was so angry he called her a "slick butch lawyeress." She sued and he eventually apologized and paid her $20,000.\par \par \uc2 Since then it has become increasingly hard to recall any extended time when Allred wasn't in the news.\par \par \uc2 It's possible that her public appearances add to that impression. With a steely eyed, don't-mess-with-me glare and a slightly nasal, Philadelphia-accented voice that can drip with sarcasm, Allred is an intimidating presence.\par \par \uc2 "My clients have told me, 'You look fearless up there,'" she says during a moment of quiet reflection. "Well, you've got to look fearless when you do what I do."\par \par \uc2 Away from the cameras, a quieter Allred emerges, softer-spoken, disarmingly charming and often very funny. She is also unfailingly polite, to the point that she is reluctant to address anyone by first name until permission has been granted.\par \par \uc2 "This is what happens when you go to an all-girls high school," she says sheepishly.\par \par \uc2 Which is exactly what Gloria Rachel Bloom did.\par \par \uc2 The only child of a door-to-door salesman and his homemaker wife, Allred's top grades got her into Philadelphia's High School for Girls, where she was a cheerleader and won a scholarship to the University of Pennsylvania.\par \par \uc2 During her four years there, she married, gave birth to her only child, divorced her husband and graduated with honors.\par \par \uc2 After earning a master's degree from New York University, she taught English at public schools before enrolling at Los Angeles' Loyola Law School. By then she had become a union activist, embracing the philosophy of one of her heroes, Mother Jones, who famously declared, "Don't agonize. Organize!"\par \par \uc2 Her support for women's rights, she says, was reinforced by a personal horror: She was raped at gunpoint during a Mexican vacation.\par \par \uc2 By the time she earned her law degree in 1975, she had decided exactly what she would do with the rest of her life. She called aside fellow graduates Nathan Goldberg and Michael Maroko and told them the three would "do good things in this world."\par \par \uc2 "Nathan was No. 1 in our class at graduation at Loyola and Michael was very high up in our class as well," says Allred, who herself graduated cum laude. The three formed Allred, Maroko and Goldberg and still work together.\par \par \uc2 Married and divorced a second time, Allred spends what free time she has these days doting on her daughter -- "She's grown up to be what I consider my best work" -- and her two college-age grandchildren.\par \par \uc2 She will mark her 70th birthday in July, but has no plans to retire.\par \par \uc2 "As long as I have this gift of life I intend to do it," she says.\par \par \uc2 Then, with a wry smile, she adds: "Some people think I will still try to do it from the Great Beyond."\par \par \uc2 9\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101026e6aq000e3\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc73}{\*\bkmkend toc73}\b \uc2 In Ga. governor's race, Republicans challenge Barnes' tough-on-immigration credentials\b0\par\par\uc2 By SHANNON McCAFFREY   \par \uc2 Associated Press Writer\par \uc2 768 \uc2 words\par \uc2 25 October 2010\par 16:52\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2010.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ATLANTA (AP) - As he seeks a second shot at the governor's mansion, Roy Barnes has staked out a hard-line stance on illegal immigration -- a very different position, Republicans say, from where he stood back when he was in office.\par \par \uc2 The Democrat says he would back an Arizona-style immigration crackdown law, which would require police enforcing other laws to question people about their immigration status if the officer has reason to doubt it, as long as there were protections against racial profiling.\par \par \uc2 And Barnes is running a campaign ad on jobs that promises "to take care of our own."\par \par \uc2 The GOP calls him a recent convert on the issue. In a new ad, the Republican Governors Association says Barnes once backed drivers' licenses for illegal immigrants and likens the former governor's views to those of President Barack Obama.\par \par \uc2 News accounts from September 2001 suggest Barnes was open to considering drivers' licenses for illegal immigrants and was awaiting results from a study from the Department of Motor Vehicle Safety.\par \par \uc2 "We've got to work this out," Barnes said at the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce convention.\par \par \uc2 In early 2002 -- amid a backlash from the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks -- Barnes backed away from the idea after talking to law enforcement and others, according to a news account.\par \par \uc2 Barnes said Monday he never supported licenses for illegal immigrants and was merely studying the issue.\par \par \uc2 "I wasn't ready to go that far, and we didn't go that far," he said.\par \par \uc2 Barnes added that he continues to support recognizing international drivers' licenses for those in the country legally.\par \par \uc2 Advocates of tougher laws aimed at curbing illegal immigration say Barnes has not been a friend.\par \par \uc2 "I would say without equivocation or hesitation that Roy Barnes has a terrible record from a pro-enforcement point of view," said D.A. King, head of the Georgia-based Dustin Inman Society, a group named for a teen killed when his family's car was struck by one driven by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Barnes' Republican rival, Nathan Deal, made illegal immigration a centerpiece of his 18 years in Congress, although he had limited success in pushing through what he proposed.\par \par \uc2 Deal was an early sponsor of legislation that would deny automatic citizenship to the children of illegal immigrants who are born in the United States. Seen for years as a fringe issue, it is an idea that's recently gained momentum.\par \par \uc2 As part of the federal deficit reduction act in 2005, Deal led the charge to require those seeking Medicaid benefits to provide identification, a move designed to halt illegal immigrants from tapping the taxpayer-funded benefits.\par \par \uc2 Georgians who feel similarly about the issue have made headway in the past few years. In 2006, the state adopted an illegal immigration bill that at the time was considered among the toughest in the nation.\par \par \uc2 In 2007, U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss was booed at a meeting of the state GOP when he voiced support for President George W. Bush's immigration bill, which critics said would lead to granting amnesty to people who came into the country illegally. Chambliss, who was running for re-election, quickly had a change of heart.\par \par \uc2 Barnes has clearly tried to position himself on the issue in a way that will appeal to more conservative voters.\par \par \uc2 "If there's a nail driven, a wire connected or concrete poured by local or state government it'll be by a legal Georgia worker," he says in a television ad promoting his jobs plan.\par \par \uc2 Beyond the driver's license flap, Republicans point to a trade mission Barnes took to Mexico in 2001, when he told then-Mexican President Vicente Fox that the presidents of Georgia's 35 colleges and universities were authorized to waive out-of-state tuition for up to 2 percent of the student population.\par \par \uc2 "We encourage them to use that discretion, particularly toward Mexicans," Barnes said.\par \par \uc2 Barnes never mentioned illegal immigrants, but Deal said it was clear what he meant: "'Send us more of yours and we will educate them,'" Deal said of Barnes' comments. "It's pretty obvious that at least some would be illegal."\par \par \uc2 Barnes said Monday the mission was about improving trade relations and that he was making the point that Georgia would be hospitable to legal immigrants from Mexico, who are vital to the state's economy.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Online:\par \par \uc2 Roy Barnes for Governor: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.roy2010.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.roy2010.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Nathan Deal for Governor: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.nathandeal.org"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.nathandeal.org}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101025e6ap002k6\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc74}{\*\bkmkend toc74}\b \uc2 Whether representing the outrageous or unfortunate, Gloria Allred always commands attention\b0\par\par\uc2 By JOHN ROGERS    \par \uc2 Associated Press Writer\par \uc2 1,472 \uc2 words\par \uc2 25 October 2010\par 13:36\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2010.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.    \par \par \uc2 LOS ANGELES (AP) - She's been called an ambulance chaser, an opportunist, a made-for-TV attorney and a shameless publicity hound.\par \par \uc2 And, Gloria Allred will tell you with a smile, those are just some of the nicer names people use to describe her.\par \par \uc2 Meg Whitman, for example, is not a fan. Allred turned this year's race for California governor upside down by stepping before the TV cameras to reveal that the Republican candidate employed an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  as a maid for nine years.\par \par \uc2 Although the message from the unabashedly liberal Allred knocked the conservative Whitman off message for a few days, it also led to an inevitable round of Allred bashing. She was lampooned by "Saturday Night Live's" Nasim Pedrad as an annoying loudmouth. Jay Leno told his "Tonight Show" audience, "How 'bout we let the maid stay, we deport Gloria Allred?"\par \par \uc2 But Allred is comfortable with controversy. Indeed, if there has been a divisive or offbeat - or sometimes both - cause to support over the past 35 years, Allred was there.\par \par \uc2 She once handed a California legislator a chastity belt at a public hearing he called to seek a ban on abortion. She tried to put former "Seinfeld" co-star Michael Richards on the witness stand at a mock trial after he shouted the N-word at black nightclub patrons who didn't think he was funny. When "Late Show" host David Letterman admitted to sexual liaisons with some of his staff, a smirking Allred held up a big sign for the cameras: "David Letterman, Just Say No to Sex in Your Workplace."\par \par \uc2 There is, however, another side of Allred.\par \par \uc2 In February, a few days after loudly demanding that Tiger Woods apologize to porn actress Joslyn James for cheating on James while he was cheating on his wife with James, Allred quietly entered a New York courthouse on behalf of the family of Megan Wright, a young woman who committed suicide after reporting she was gang raped in a dorm at Dominican College.\par \par \uc2 The suit, scheduled to come to trial next year, has already been credited with prompting an investigation by New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo, who concluded the school was underreporting campus crime statistics.\par \par \uc2 So which is the real Allred?\par \par \uc2 The bombastic publicity seeker who went on television to hector authorities to investigate the late Michael Jackson's parenting skills? (Jackson himself told her to "go to hell.")\par \par \uc2 Or the one who won a $15 million settlement with \uc2 Circuit City\uc2  two years ago for 217 workers who said they were fired for being too old?\par \par \uc2 Is it the one who sued a condominium board for telling a woman to quit kissing her boyfriend in her driveway, or the one who persuaded a jury to award more than $18 million to a man who said he was fired for reporting his female boss had sexually harassed him?\par \par \uc2 To Allred, they are one and the same.\par \par \uc2 "I don't regret any of the cases I've taken on," says the attorney, dressed in a pinstriped pantsuit with a turtleneck top and pink jacket as she sits in the conference room of her law firm's spacious 15th-floor office. To her back is a stunning panorama of Los Angeles, stretching from downtown to the Hollywood sign.\par \par \uc2 "I'm not a politician. I don't put my finger in the wind to try to determine which way it is blowing, to try to curry favor with the public. I do what I believe is right," Allred insists.\par \par \uc2 Meticulous attorney that she is, Allred has come well prepared for an interview that will last nearly three hours. She is toting a thick stack of files on civil rights cases in which she has prevailed, including a $1.7 million settlement she won for six poor migrant farmworkers who said they were denied employment because they were women.\par \par \uc2 It was not quite the headline-grabbing case Allred took on earlier this year when she persuaded the federal Transportation Security Administration to change the way it screens airline passengers after one of them was handed a pair of pliers and told to remove her nipple rings.\par \par \uc2 But Allred sees a common thread running through those and all her other cases: Always, she says, she defends the powerless.\par \par \uc2 In the process, she has become arguably the most recognized civil rights attorney in the country.\par \par \uc2 "She's generally treated like a rock star by the average person when you walk down the street with her," laughs Allred's daughter, Lisa Bloom, a well-known attorney in her own right and a legal analyst for CBS News and CNN. "Women especially, and older women especially, will often come up and say, 'Thank you for being an inspiration.'"\par \par \uc2 Those who have been on the other end of an Allred assault likely feel differently, although it's hard to find any who will say a bad word publicly about her.\par \par \uc2 "She is not somebody I would want mad at me," says Hollywood publicist Michael Levine who has represented Jackson and others who have run afoul of Allred. "She is unrelenting and ferocious."\par \par \uc2 But Levine also says he counts Allred as a friend, as does criminal defense attorney Mark Geragos, who tangled with her when he represented Scott Peterson, a California man convicted of killing his pregnant wife, Laci, in 2002 and dumping her body in San Francisco Bay. Allred represented Peterson's mistress, Amber Frey, whose testimony helped convict Peterson in court while Allred lambasted him on TV during his trial.\par \par \uc2 "Personally, I think the world of her," Geragos says of Allred. "She's a tenacious advocate."\par \par \uc2 Allred was just six years out of law school when she caught the public's attention at a 1981 state Senate committee hearing where she gave the late Sen. John Schmitz the chastity belt. He was so angry he called her a "slick butch lawyeress." She sued and he eventually apologized and paid her $20,000.\par \par \uc2 Since then it has become increasingly hard to recall any extended time when Allred wasn't in the news.\par \par \uc2 It's possible that her public appearances add to that impression. With a steely eyed, don't-mess-with-me glare and a slightly nasal, Philadelphia-accented voice that can drip with sarcasm, Allred is an intimidating presence.\par \par \uc2 "My clients have told me, 'You look fearless up there,'" she says during a moment of quiet reflection. "Well, you've got to look fearless when you do what I do."\par \par \uc2 Away from the cameras, a quieter Allred emerges, softer-spoken, disarmingly charming and often very funny. She is also unfailingly polite, to the point that she is reluctant to address anyone by first name until permission has been granted.\par \par \uc2 "This is what happens when you go to an all-girls high school," she says sheepishly.\par \par \uc2 Which is exactly what Gloria Rachel Bloom did.\par \par \uc2 The only child of a door-to-door salesman and his homemaker wife, Allred's top grades got her into Philadelphia's High School for Girls, where she was a cheerleader and won a scholarship to the University of Pennsylvania.\par \par \uc2 During her four years there, she married, gave birth to her only child, divorced her husband and graduated with honors.\par \par \uc2 After earning a master's degree from New York University, she taught English at public schools before enrolling at Los Angeles' Loyola Law School. By then she had become a union activist, embracing the philosophy of one of her heroes, Mother Jones, who famously declared, "Don't agonize. Organize!"\par \par \uc2 Her support for women's rights, she says, was reinforced by a personal horror: She was raped at gunpoint during a Mexican vacation.\par \par \uc2 By the time she earned her law degree in 1975, she had decided exactly what she would do with the rest of her life. She called aside fellow graduates Nathan Goldberg and Michael Maroko and told them the three would "do good things in this world."\par \par \uc2 "Nathan was No. 1 in our class at graduation at Loyola and Michael was very high up in our class as well," says Allred, who herself graduated cum laude. The three formed Allred, Maroko and Goldberg and still work together.\par \par \uc2 Married and divorced a second time, Allred spends what free time she has these days doting on her daughter - "She's grown up to be what I consider my best work" - and her two college-age grandchildren.\par \par \uc2 She will mark her 70th birthday in July, but has no plans to retire.\par \par \uc2 "As long as I have this gift of life I intend to do it," she says.\par \par \uc2 Then, with a wry smile, she adds: "Some people think I will still try to do it from the Great Beyond."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101025e6ap001yq\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc75}{\*\bkmkend toc75}\b \uc2 Perry launches ad over officer slaying; White calls it 'shameless' exploitation of widow\b0\par\par\uc2 By KELLEY SHANNON   \par \uc2 AP Political Writer\par \uc2 918 \uc2 words\par \uc2 25 October 2010\par 18:35\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2010.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 AUSTIN, Texas (AP) - Democrat Bill White accused Republican Gov. Rick Perry on Monday of "shamelessly" exploiting the widow of a Houston police officer who was killed by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  by using her in an ad that blames the former mayor's immigration policies for the death.\par \par \uc2 White said the Texas-Mexico border wasn't secure enough to keep out the immigrant, a convicted sex offender who sneaked back into the U.S. after being deported. The former Houston mayor also noted that Perry's administration deleted immigrant sex offenders' names from a public database once they were deported.\par \par \uc2 "Now to hide that sorry record, he's exploiting shamelessly the grief of a widow in Houston," White said during a news conference in Austin.\par \par \uc2 Perry's television ad began airing statewide over the weekend. It features Houston police Sgt. Joslyn Johnson discussing the death her husband, Officer Rodney Johnson, who was fatally shot during a traffic stop in 2006 by Juan Leonardo Quintero-Perez.\par \par \uc2 Perry defended the ad during a campaign stop in Houston, saying if White finds fault with Joslyn Johnson's own words, "then he needs to have that conversation with her." Perry also noted that he's been endorsed by the Houston Police Officers Union, where Johnson is on the board.\par \par \uc2 "I think it's a powerful thing for your hometown police union to stand up and say we've worked with this guy, we know how he operates, and we don't want him to be governor," Perry said.\par \par \uc2 Rodney Johnson arrested Quintero-Perez after he couldn't provide a driver's license, then was shot four times in the head after Quintero-Perez pulled a gun from his waistband as he sat handcuffed in the back of the officer's patrol car. Johnson, 40, apparently missed the gun when he patted down Quintero-Perez.\par \par \uc2 "In the past, Bill White supported sanctuary city policies that made it difficult for officers to safely do their jobs," Joslyn Johnson says in the ad. "I trust Governor Perry to secure our safety. Bill White had his opportunity as mayor of Houston, and he failed."\par \par \uc2 Johnson, who was at the Perry campaign event in Houston, repeated her contention that White "had the opportunity." She said she wasn't being exploited.\par \par \uc2 Rick Van Houten, president of the Fort Worth Police Officers Association, was among three law enforcement officers who joined White at his campaign stop in Austin. He blasted Perry for the ad, saying "for any politician to use this death as political cannon fodder is just shameless. You do not exploit the grieving family members for political purposes."\par \par \uc2 Court records show that Quintero-Perez was deported in 1999, after being convicted of indecency with a child, but slipped back into Texas. He was convicted in Johnson's death in 2008, and sentenced to life in prison.\par \par \uc2 White denied that his city's policies toward immigrants played a role in the officer's death.\par \par \uc2 "This officer's death is the responsibility of the shooter, who has been tried and convicted," White said. "There was a failure to secure our border against these individuals, such as the shooter in this case."\par \par \uc2 White said that two weeks after the shooting, his office wrote to the Texas Department of Public Safety noting that the agency had removed deported sex offenders' names from the public sex offender database. White said the agency put more than 2,000 \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  sex offenders back into the public database after his complaint.\par \par \uc2 Perry said deported sex offenders' names always remained in a law enforcement database used by police.\par \par \uc2 The names were removed from the public database because the offenders were no longer supposed to be in Texas, Perry campaign spokesman Mark Miner said. Asked why the names shouldn't have remained publicly accessible, in case deported offenders come back to the U.S., Miner responded: "That's why we have to secure the border."\par \par \uc2 Perry has tried to cast White as a mayor who presided over a "sanctuary city," a reference to local governments that limit enforcement of federal immigration laws.\par \par \uc2 Johnson's shooting renewed criticism of the Houston Police Department's policy that only allows officers to ask about immigration status after arresting a suspect. Critics of the policy said it encouraged illegal immigration by tying officers' hands in enforcing the law, but supporters said the policy prevented racial profiling and discrimination.\par \par \uc2 After the shooting, the police department said it would work more closely with federal officials to identify illegal immigrants involved in crimes.\par \par \uc2 White said Houston and Harris County became part of the "Secure Communities" program in 2008. The program checks the fingerprints of people arrested against available federal databases to identify prisoners with criminal histories who can be deported by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\par \par \uc2 Also Monday, Perry's office announced the capture Jose H. Morales, a member of the Mexican Mafia and on the state's Top 10 Most Wanted Fugitive list since April. The 47-year-old convicted sex offender from San Antonio was arrested last week in Mexico. He now held in the Webb County Jail in Laredo and awaiting extradition to Bexar County, the U.S . Marshal's Office said.\par \par \uc2 Morales has been a fugitive since 2002 when he removed an ankle monitor and fled San Antonio.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press Writer Michael Graczyk contributed to this story from Houston.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101025e6ap001tx\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - When Rohan Coombs joined the U.S. Marine Corps, he never thought one day he would be locked up in an immigration detention center and facing deportation from the country he had vowed to defend.\par \par \uc2 Coombs, 43, born in Jamaica, immigrated to the United States legally as a child with his family. He signed up to serve his adopted nation for six years -- first in Japan and the Philippines, then in the Persian Gulf during the first war with Iraq.\par \par \uc2 Up to 8,000 non-citizens enlist in the U.S. Armed Forces every year and serve alongside American troops. As of May 2010, there were 16,966 non-citizens on active duty. The military does not allow illegal immigrants to enlist.\par \par \uc2 If non-citizens die while serving, they are given citizenship and a military funeral. If they live and get in trouble with the law, as Coombs did, they can get caught in the net of a 1996 immigration law that greatly expanded the list of crimes for which non-citizens can be deported.\par \par \uc2 "As far as I was concerned, I was a citizen," said Coombs, whose soft-spoken, introspective nature contrast with his physical presence. Coombs stands 6 foot 5 and weighs more than 260 pounds -- a gentle giant, according to his fiancee, Robyn Sword.\par \par \uc2 Now advocates of non-citizen servicemen and women are trying to change that. Attorneys are taking cases like Coombs' to court, arguing that an immigrant who serves in the Armed Forces should be considered a U.S. national and protected from deportation.\par \par \uc2 "These are people who served us -- whether they are model human beings or not," said Coombs' attorney, Craig Shagin of Harrisburg, Pa. "They served in our uniforms, in our wars. If they were POWs, they'd be considered American prisoners."\par \par \uc2 Rep. Bob Filner, D-Calif., chairman of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, is looking into potential changes to the law so immigrants who serve in the military can avoid deportation.\par \par \uc2 "You come back from Iraq or Afghanistan today, you have put yourself on the line for this country," said Filner. "An incredible number of kids come back with an injury or illness that puts them in trouble with the law. To simply have these people deported is not a good way to thank them for their service."\par \par \uc2 Advocates estimate that thousands of veterans have been deported or are in detention. Government officials say they have no tally but plan to begin tracking the numbers.\par \par \uc2 The push comes as criminal courts are increasingly listening to arguments for leniency for veterans.\par \par \uc2 So-called veterans courts, which give them specialized treatment, now number more than 30, with a dozen more planned.\par \par \uc2 Next month, new U.S. Sentencing Commission rules will make it possible for federal judges to consider a criminal defendant's military service and mental and emotional condition to issue a lesser prison sentence. The rules, however, would not apply to immigration judges.\par \par \uc2 Most immigrants serve with distinction. The Center for Naval Analyses, a federally funded research and development center for the Navy and the Marine Corps, found that non-citizens are far more likely to complete their enlistment obligations successfully than their U.S.-born counterparts.\par \par \uc2 Coombs was one who did not make the grade.\par \par \uc2 He spent 10 months in the Persian Gulf and lost friends to combat, he said. After the war, he felt depressed and anxious. His family was far away in New York, and he said "whining" to fellow Marines didn't seem an option.\par \par \uc2 Instead, he got involved with drugs, and he got caught.\par \par \uc2 In 1992, he was court-martialed for possession of cocaine and marijuana with the intent to distribute, and was given 18 months of confinement and a dishonorable discharge.\par \par \uc2 He continued to struggle with drugs.\par \par \uc2 "Things would be going well, then something would happen," he said.\par \par \uc2 He got married, and that helped. When his wife died in 2001 of diabetes-related complications, he started smoking marijuana again.\par \par \uc2 In 2008, he was busted for selling marijuana to an undercover officer while working as a bouncer in an Orange County bar. He spent eight months in state prison.\par \par \uc2 "I don't want to make excuses. I made mistakes. I thought I knew the consequences -- I served my time," he said in a telephone interview.\par \par \uc2 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement found that his criminal convictions made him eligible for deportation, and he was turned over to ICE after serving his sentence. He has been held in a San Diego immigration detention center for 22 months and is appealing to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court.\par \par \uc2 Coombs was stunned to realize he could be forced to leave the country for his crimes.\par \par \uc2 "This is the only life I've known," he said. "The only time I left this country was when I was deployed overseas. This is my home."\par \par \uc2 On the other side of the country, Dardar Paye is appealing his deportation case to the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania.\par \par \uc2 Paye came to the U.S. from war torn Liberia as a 13-year-old. He joined the Army in 1998, serving in Kuwait as part of Operation Desert Fox and then in a NATO peacekeeping mission in Kosovo. He returned to New Jersey, where his family lives, to spend another year and a half with the Army National Guard.\par \par \uc2 In 2008, he was convicted of six weapons-related offenses, including two involving firearms dealing, and served time in federal prison. Now, like Coombs, he is facing deportation and is feeling betrayed.\par \par \uc2 "When I was in Kuwait, in Kosovo, I was like everyone else who was there, putting their lives on the line," said Paye, who in the Army was an armored vehicle crewman. "Now I feel like they just used me for what they wanted, and now they're throwing me away."\par \par \uc2 Advocates and immigration attorneys say that before the 1996 \uc2 Illegal Immigrant\uc2  Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act, few immigrant veterans were deported, because immigration authorities could take their service into consideration.\par \par \uc2 The law added crimes such as drug possession for sale to the list of serious crimes that could lead to deportation of a legal immigrant.\par \par \uc2 "Drugs, anger management, weapons charges, that's what a lot of vets are getting caught for, and there is no relief," said Margaret Stock, a recently retired Army reservist and immigration attorney who taught at the United States Military Academy at West Point. "The 1996 law really put the nails in their coffin."\par \par \uc2 Coombs' attorneys, Shagin and Heather Boxeth of San Diego, Calif., who have represented or advised immigrant veterans in similar straits, estimate up to 4,000 veterans who served as long ago as World War II are now in immigration detention or have been deported, but acknowledge that there are no hard numbers.\par \par \uc2 ICE spokeswoman Lori Haley said identifying and removing dangerous criminals from the country is an agency priority -- and that the cases of people with prior military service are carefully reviewed.\par \par \uc2 Meantime, the military has started to offer a fast-track to citizenship to immigrants currently serving. Now, most joining the Army can expect to be citizens by the end of basic training, said Stock. Other branches are expected to join the effort by the end of the year.\par \par \uc2 That help doesn't extend to those who have already served such as Paye and Coombs.\par \par \uc2 "If I had died," said Coombs, they would have made me a citizen, given me a military funeral, and given the flag to my mom. But I didn't die. Here I am. I just want another chance."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101024e6ao002ci\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc77}{\*\bkmkend toc77}\b \uc2 Poll finds Brown with wider lead in Calif. gov's race; Boxer edge narrows in US Senate race\b0\par\par\uc2 By JULIET WILLIAMS   \par \uc2 Associated Press Writer\par \uc2 711 \uc2 words\par \uc2 24 October 2010\par 08:01\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2010.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) - A new poll shows Democrat Jerry Brown with a growing lead over his Republican challenger, Meg Whitman, as a gubernatorial campaign that has focused on personal attacks in recent weeks winds to an end.\par \par \uc2 The University of Southern California-Los Angeles Times poll released Sunday found Brown, the former two-term governor, leading former \uc2 eBay\uc2  chief executive Whitman, 50 percent to 38 percent among likely voters. Last month, the same poll showed Brown with an edge of 5 percentage points.\par \par \uc2 In the U.S. Senate race, incumbent Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer has a slight lead over Republican Carly Fiorina, the former CEO of \uc2 Hewlett-Packard Co\uc2 ., 47 percent to 41 percent, Boxer's edge was 8 percentage points in the earlier USC-Times poll.\par \par \uc2 Brown also was leading, although by a smaller margin, in a separate poll released last week. His campaign has begun intensive advertising after months of sustained spending by his billionaire opponent.\par \par \uc2 Whitman, who unlike Brown faced a competitive primary in June, has spent $162 million on her campaign to date, about $142 million of it from her personal fortune. Brown's campaign has spent about $25 million.\par \par \uc2 Their general election campaign is the costliest in the state's history, according to the California Fair Political Practices Commission.\par \par \uc2 Even with her expensive media campaign, Whitman has found herself on the defensive in recent weeks, especially after she was forced to admit that her former housekeeper of nine years was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from Mexico. Whitman says she fired Nicky Diaz Santillan last year when she learned Santillan was in the country illegally, but declined to help her get an attorney. Santillan said Whitman had clues that she was in the country illegally and fired her only after she decided to run for governor.\par \par \uc2 The USC-Times survey is the first public poll in which respondents were asked directly about the controversy. More than half of likely voters said Whitman did not handle the incident very well, while about four in 10 did not believe Brown handled the fallout from that incident well.\par \par \uc2 The survey also found only 24 percent of likely voters said they believe Whitman tells the truth, compared with 44 percent for Brown.\par \par \uc2 The poll did not ask about a later controversy involving a female Brown campaign aide overheard on a leaked audio tape calling Whitman a "whore" for cutting a deal with a police union for its endorsement. Both controversies dominated the final two gubernatorial debates, overshadowing issues voters have identified as crucial, such as the state of the economy and overcoming political gridlock in Sacramento.\par \par \uc2 While more than eight in 10 Californians say the state is headed in the wrong direction, they are split about which of the gubernatorial candidates would best handle the economy. Whitman has hammered on the theme of job creation and turning around the economy for nearly two years.\par \par \uc2 The poll also surveyed Latino voters, a crucial and growing demographic in the state. Those voters preferred Democrats Brown and Boxer by a wider margin than the overall electorate, despite Whitman's intensive courting of them through Spanish-language advertising.\par \par \uc2 Brown has wooed Latino voters in part by pledging to sign the Dream Act, which would let U.S. high school graduates who were brought into the country illegally as children become legal residents after spending two years in college or the military. He also has reminded those voters that he marched with labor leader Cesar Chavez at the beginning of his political career.\par \par \uc2 Whitman has responded with ads attacking Brown for his "soft" stance on immigration, saying California needs to devote its scarce resources to legal residents.\par \par \uc2 The poll surveyed 922 likely voters by telephone from Oct. 13-20. It has a sampling error margin of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points for likely voters, and plus or minus 4.6 percentage points for the 460 Latino respondents.\par \par \uc2 Democrats have a 13.4 percentage point registration edge in California, but Republicans are thought to have the momentum this year. The poll anticipates only a 4 percentage point turnout advantage for Democrats.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101024e6ao001up\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

PAULSON   \par \uc2 Associated Press Writer\par \uc2 815 \uc2 words\par \uc2 23 October 2010\par 12:59\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2010.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 DENVER (AP) - American Constitution Party gubernatorial candidate Tom Tancredo has decided no more Mister Nice Guy. He's going after his opponents -- Democrat and Republican -- with double-barreled ads he hopes will take them out in the waning days of Colorado's gubernatorial campaign.\par \par \uc2 Tancredo's campaign spent about $60,000 on the ads, which are airing more than a dozen times a day on some rural radio stations and some television stations.\par \par \uc2 His ad against GOP gubernatorial candidate Dan Maes includes a litany of accusations made over the past few months. Titled, "Dan Maes: Bankrupt," it cites Maes' bankruptcy filing at age 29, one he failed to disclose. It also criticizes Maes for taking $300 from an elderly supporter for his campaign when the supporter had said the money was a gift to help pay Maes' mortgage. The ad also hits Maes for reportedly billing his campaign $44,000 for driving 80,000 miles on the campaign trail.\par \par \uc2 "Make no mistake: Dan Maes is going to lose this race in a big way because a campaign built on lies, just like a life built on lies, always catches up to you," the narrator intones.\par \par \uc2 The ad against Democrat John Hickenlooper, dubbed, "Hickenlooper: Out of Touch," disputes the Denver mayor's claim that he created 1,000 jobs. It alleges many of those jobs were taken by illegal immigrants. It also claims Hickenlooper raised taxes by $290 million and still lost 39,000 jobs. Hickenlooper says voters approved the tax increases. He disputes the job figures.\par \par \uc2 Robert Duffy, a political science professor at Colorado State University, said the only way Tancredo can catch Hickenlooper in the polls is to keep taking votes from Maes.\par \par \uc2 "He has to go nuclear on this. If he really wants to win, this is the time," Duffy said.\par \par \uc2 Bay Buchanan, Tancredo's campaign spokeswoman, said the ads are designed to reach voters in western and southern Colorado, where the media cacophony from the populated Front Range hasn't penetrated.\par \par \uc2 "Those people haven't got the message. If Maes gets 18 percent of the votes outside the Front Range, we need to bring them in. Those are our votes, those are our base," Buchanan said. "We know it's winnable. When we go after Maes, the votes are going to Tom."\par \par \uc2 Hickenlooper has gotten a "free ride" the past few months while Tancredo and Maes have gone after each other, Buchanan said. Tancredo left the GOP to head the ACP ticket after Maes, with tea party support, defeated former U.S. Rep. Scott McInnis in the primary. Tancredo said neither had a chance of beating Hickenlooper.\par \par \uc2 During their next-to-last debate on Friday, Tancredo and Maes jumped on Hickenlooper over Denver's treatment of illegal immigrants. Tancredo demanded that Hickenlooper hold a one-hour debate over Tancredo's claims that Denver is a sanctuary city. Hickenlooper said it would be unfair to exclude Maes.\par \par \uc2 Hickenlooper also objected when Tancredo accused him of responsibility in the deaths of three people after a traffic accident involving an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who had been arrested a dozen times but eluded deportation. Hickenlooper told Tancredo "it is the seedier side of politics to exploit someone else's tragedy."\par \par \uc2 Tancredo and Hickenlooper both head to Colorado's Western Slope this week, an acknowledgment that voters outside the metro areas will be key to winning. Hickenlooper is making a bus tour, beginning with the Front Range and Western Slope, and Tancredo heads to Grand Junction to court tea party supporters -- many of whom are throwing their support behind him as Maes continues to lose support.\par \par \uc2 The latest tea party group to bail was the Western Slope Conservative Alliance, which said Maes has been "less than forthcoming" about his background.\par \par \uc2 "You cannot win," said board member Richard Schoenradt.\par \par \uc2 Maes has been dogged by his record as a police officer in Liberal, Kan., where he was fired for a failed investigation of a gambling ring; fines for campaign finance violations; his equating a Denver bike-share program to a U.N. conspiracy; and his pledge to fire 2,000 state workers as governor "just like that."\par \par \uc2 State GOP chairman Dick Wadhams says there is a very real possibility the state GOP could lose its Colorado majority party status if Maes doesn't get 10 percent of the vote. That would force GOP candidates to compete with other third-party candidates for a place on the ballot for the next four years.\par \par \uc2 Maes is trying to ignore Tancredo and go after Hickenlooper, said Maes campaign spokesman Nate Strauch.\par \par \uc2 Duffy said he doubts Tancredo's new plan will work and could hurt the GOP for the next four years.\par \par \uc2 "This is mutually assured destruction that he's been doing from Day One," Duffy said.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101023e6an0024a\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

BONNER and JOHN MILLER   \par \uc2 Associated Press Writers\par \uc2 589 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 October 2010\par 18:33\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2010.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 BOISE, Idaho (AP) - Republican Raul Labrador's campaign has pulled a new ad that took a remark made by U.S. Rep. Walt Minnick out of context to suggest the Democrat favors a middle-class tax increase.\par \par \uc2 Minnick misspoke during a 2008 debate on Idaho Public Television with then U.S. Rep. Bill Sali, but then corrected himself two minutes later and said: "We need to have a middle class tax cut, not another tax cut for the rich."\par \par \uc2 After the debate, former state Senate Majority Leader Rod Beck pointed out that Minnick had made an error when he first said: "We need a middle-class tax increase."\par \par \uc2 Here's what Beck said at the time during a post-debate analysis that aired statewide: Minnick "talked about, 'Oh I want to give a middle class tax cut. Now of course, he kind of, sort of caught himself, because he originally said 'middle-class tax increase.' His wife was down in the audience, going 'Whoa, whoa, you mean tax cut.' "\par \par \uc2 Labrador's campaign launched a new TV ad Thursday that included a short video clip of Minnick's misstep but made no reference to his correction. Labrador's campaign did not immediately concede the ad was in error, but spokesman Phil Hardy later said they would revise the TV spot because it may have infringed copyright laws.\par \par \uc2 "We have been notified by Idaho Public Television that part of the material in our intended new advertisement is in fact copyrighted material, which we were not aware of," Hardy said in a statement. "As this is the case, our ad will be revised immediately and any material taken from Idaho Public Television will not be used."\par \par \uc2 For the past three decades, the Idaho Public Television debates have attempted to provide a platform for candidates to "speak to the issues of the day," said station manager Peter Morrill.\par \par \uc2 "We have never intended for these debates to be excerpted for campaign videos or political purposes," Morrill said.\par \par \uc2 Beck told The Associated Press on Thursday he hadn't yet seen Labrador's new commercial, but said whatever he said on the post-debate analysis show in 2008 in reference to Minnick's mistake was accurate.\par \par \uc2 Beck is a strong Labrador supporter, but says it's inappropriate -- even during the heat of a tough campaign fight -- to take a rival's words out of context.\par \par \uc2 "I personally would not misrepresent a candidate's views," Beck told The AP. "But I don't think Walt has anything to complain about, the way he's run his campaign, trying to make Raul look like an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , or misstating his position on immigration."\par \par \uc2 Minnick, who represents Idaho's 1st Congressional District, has launched negative ads targeting Labrador's work as an immigration attorney. One ad claims more than half of his work is "helping illegal immigrants stay in the United States."\par \par \uc2 For weeks now, Minnick's 2008 gaffe has been taken out of context on pro-Labrador websites. But Labrador's new ad was the first time the campaign has officially pushed the mistake.\par \par \uc2 When contacted Thursday, Labrador spokesman Phil Hardy said the campaign was reviewing the full video from the 2008 debate. The Idaho Republican Party said in a statement Thursday it supported Labrador's new ad.\par \par \uc2 A call to Idaho GOP Executive Director Jonathan Parker was not immediately returned.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101021e6al002ab\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

BLOOD   \par \uc2 Associated Press Writer\par \uc2 682 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 October 2010\par 17:53\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2010.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 LOS ANGELES (AP) - Republican gubernatorial candidate Meg Whitman on Thursday accused her Democratic opponent of lying to voters about her stance on immigration to undercut her support among Latinos.\par \par \uc2 After meeting with Latino metal workers during a campaign stop in South Los Angeles, Whitman said Jerry Brown lied when he said she supports Arizona's tough new law to curb illegal immigration, which put local police officers on the front lines of enforcing federal immigration law.\par \par \uc2 "He is saying that I am for the Arizona law. It's a bold-faced lie," Whitman said.\par \par \uc2 "I have been so firm on this," she added. "It makes me mad he is just out there telling lies."\par \par \uc2 In the Republican primary, the billionaire former chief executive of \uc2 eBay\uc2  said she supported Arizona's right to enact its own laws but would not sign such a law in California.\par \par \uc2 When the candidates met for their second debate earlier this month in Fresno, Brown accused Whitman of trying to have it both ways on immigration.\par \par \uc2 "As far as the Arizona law, she's says the Arizona law is OK for Arizona. So she's for the Arizona law for the people who are suffering right now, the people who are cleaners in Arizona," Brown said at the Oct. 2 debate. "Here in California where they're not proposing the law, she says it doesn't apply here."\par \par \uc2 Asked about Whitman's accusation Thursday, Brown declined to comment to reporters after a campaign event at San Diego State University, where he spoke about education and his experience in government.\par \par \uc2 "I couldn't comment. I'd like to see it," Brown said when told about Whitman's comments.\par \par \uc2 One of the state's largest unions has been mailing campaign fliers to decline-to-state voters and Hispanic households reinforcing Brown's message that Whitman supports the immigration law for Arizona.\par \par \uc2 Whitman has been courting the state's Latino community in the run-up to the Nov. 2 election and said she cannot win without Hispanic support. But Whitman also said she does not support allowing illegal immigrants to obtain California driver's licenses.\par \par \uc2 Polls taken over the summer suggested Whitman was making inroads among Latinos with her aggressive advertising and outreach in the Central Valley, Los Angeles and other areas with a high proportion of Hispanic residents. But the momentum appears to have swung to Brown, who rolled out his campaign after Labor Day.\par \par \uc2 A Public Policy Institute of California poll released Wednesday showed Brown with support from 51 percent of likely Hispanic voters, compared to 22 percent support for Whitman.\par \par \uc2 Whitman drew negative coverage this fall after the revelation she had an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  housekeeper for nine years, a woman whom she described as an extended member of her family. Whitman said she fired the woman when she discovered she was illegal and then rebuffed the housekeeper's request for help with her status.\par \par \uc2 "I don't think it's going to hurt me" with Hispanic voters, she said Thursday.\par \par \uc2 Whitman's criticism of Brown comes the day the nation's largest Spanish-language newspaper, La Opinion, endorsed the state's attorney general, saying he would bring a "more inclusive and pragmatic approach" to solving the state's problems.\par \par \uc2 A few dozen nurses wearing red T-shirts protested outside Whitman's event, shouting "Meg Whitman doesn't care. California be aware." The California Nurses Association, which launched a statewide bus tour Thursday, has been a vocal and colorful critic of Whitman, who they fear will roll back regulations intended to safeguard patients.\par \par \uc2 Whitman has said she supports the current nurse-patient ratios, although union officials say they don't trust her to follow through.\par \par \uc2 They were forced to remain on the street after security locked the gates at the plant.\par \par \uc2 "They might lock us out, but they aren't going to silence our voices," said Malinda Markowitz, a registered nurse and co-president of the association.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101021e6al0021f\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) - Buoyed by a surge in support from women and Latinos, Democrat Jerry Brown has taken a lead in the California governor's race, while the race between incumbent U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer and GOP challenger Carly Fiorina has tightened, according to a new poll.\par \par \uc2 The Public Policy Institute of California survey released late Wednesday found Brown with an 8-point lead over Whitman, 44 percent to 36 percent, among likely voters.\par \par \uc2 In the Senate race, the poll found Boxer continues to hold a slight advantage with likely voters over Fiorina, 43 percent to 38 percent, an edge that has diminished since September, when Boxer had a 7-point edge.\par \par \uc2 Independent voters are split in both races, and there is flagging support for the two measures on the November ballot that are drawing national attention.\par \par \uc2 Proposition 19, which would legalize recreational marijuana use in the state, has support from just 44 percent of likely voters, with almost half saying they will cast their ballots against it. That represents an 8-point drop in support since a previous PPIC poll in September.\par \par \uc2 Proposition 23, which would suspend California's landmark greenhouse gas emissions law until the unemployment rate falls to 5.5 percent for a year, has support from just 37 percent of likely voters, with 48 percent opposed. It is funded by out-of-state oil companies and is opposed by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and alternative-energy entrepreneurs.\par \par \uc2 The gubernatorial and Senate races have been characterized in recent weeks by nonstop attack ads on TV and campaign fliers flooding mailboxes throughout the state.\par \par \uc2 The campaigning is being driven largely by independent conservative groups spending in support of Fiorina, unions supporting Brown and a record-setting spending spree by Whitman, who has tapped her personal fortune for $142 million and has raised nearly $30 million more from outside contributors.\par \par \uc2 Whitman finds herself trailing the former two-term governor despite her enormous campaign account and extensive niche targeting of voters by gender, race and geography.\par \par \uc2 The poll found Brown with 51 percent support among Latinos, despite Whitman's aggressive targeting of them, and that women also favor Brown over Whitman 47 percent to 32 percent. Men and white voters are divided.\par \par \uc2 Brown campaign spokesman Sterling Clifford said the poll shows Brown's strategy of holding off on campaigning is paying off because many voters are only now tuning in.\par \par \uc2 "Jerry said from the beginning of this campaign, in the post-Labor Day period when people are paying attention, we'd be a lot more aggressive with Jerry's message of fiscal discipline of state government and growing the green economy," Clifford said. "They like what Jerry has to say."\par \par \uc2 Unions also have flooded voters' mail boxes with campaign literature critical of Whitman.\par \par \uc2 Whitman spokesman Tucker Bounds noted that voters have repeatedly ranked jobs and the economy as their number one issue this year. PPIC found voters preferred Whitman over Brown on this issue, as well as on the state budget and taxes.\par \par \uc2 "I don't know of a single poll in this election that Meg hasn't polled well on jobs and the economy," he said. "When voters go into the voting booth, they will support Meg because she is the most credible candidate to deliver new jobs and real change in Sacramento."\par \par \uc2 The survey was taken after two controversies that roiled the governor's race -- the revelation that Whitman had an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  housekeeper for nine years and a leaked recording of a private conversation in which a Brown campaign aide called Whitman a "whore" for allegedly cutting a pension deal with law enforcement unions to get their endorsement.\par \par \uc2 In the Senate race, Fiorina said during a campaign stop this week that negative ads against her have not swayed voters. Her spokeswoman, Julie Soderlund, said Tuesday's poll shows Fiorina has the momentum.\par \par \uc2 "Barbara Boxer has hit her ceiling with voters, and on Nov. 2 she'll meet the floor when they sweep her out of office," Soderlund said.\par \par \uc2 Boxer campaign manager Rose Kapolczynski said the senator always expected the race to tighten in the final weeks.\par \par \uc2 "We've had a sustained pounding for the last two months, much of it by outside groups, and it takes a toll," Kapolczynski said. "The good news is we're still ahead, and we have a strong campaign here for the next 13 days."\par \par \uc2 The poll was conducted by telephone in English and Spanish from Oct. 10 to 17. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points for the 1,067 likely voters surveyed.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press Writers Judy Lin, Samantha Young, Kevin Freking and Robin Hindery also contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101021e6al0003l\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc86}{\*\bkmkend toc86}\b \uc2 Tancredo loves headlines, and he's generating them with his 3rd-party gubernatorial bid.\b0\par\par\uc2 By STEVEN K. PAULSON   \par \uc2 Associated Press Writer\par \uc2 707 \uc2 words\par \uc2 20 October 2010\par 17:39\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2010.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 DENVER (AP) - Tom Tancredo loves to speak his mind. He's relishing it in his run for Colorado's governor.\par \par \uc2 Sometimes, he admits, he goes too far. Like his recent suggestion that Interstate 70 motorists pay tolls -- anathema in this low-tax state.\par \par \uc2 "It's not for everybody," he argued. "You don't have to go there."\par \par \uc2 "You know, I jumped too fast, I need to give that more thought," he said later.\par \par \uc2 The man best known for his illegal immigration stands drew gasps from a business crowd when he apologized if their lunch was cold. Half the wait staff and the kitchen staff usually leave when he walks into a room, he explained.\par \par \uc2 It's a recurrent theme with Tancredo, who got thrown out of the White House for suggesting then-President George W. Bush was soft on illegal immigrants. He once recommended that the United States bomb Mecca if there is was a nuclear terrorist attack against the United States.\par \par \uc2 And yet it hasn't hurt his third-party campaign atop the American Constitution Party ticket. Tancredo bolted the Republican Party after tea party candidate Dan Maes won the GOP's gubernatorial nomination, arguing Maes is unelectable and that someone has to challenge Democrat and Denver Mayor John Hickenlooper.\par \par \uc2 Tancredo's stock among voters and contributors has risen as Maes loses support following a series of campaign gaffes. Some polls have him nearly within striking distance of Hickenlooper, to date the prohibitive favorite.\par \par \uc2 Over the past two weeks, Tancredo collected $220,000 for a fundraising total of $682,000. Maes raised $22,000 for a total of $304,000.\par \par \uc2 Hickenlooper raised $387,000 from Sept. 30 to Oct. 13, bringing his total to $3.7 million.\par \par \uc2 Tancredo said much of his support comes from opponents of illegal immigration across the nation.\par \par \uc2 "They recognize that a lot of the play now is at the state level, and that the federal government is not going to get involved" in enforcing immigration laws, Tancredo said.\par \par \uc2 Tancredo's ads against Hickenlooper have focused squarely on immigration. One unsavory ad cites the case of an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who drove into an Aurora ice cream shop, killing a 3-year-old boy. The boy's father asks Hickenlooper how he can sleep at night.\par \par \uc2 As governor, Tancredo promises to push for an Arizona-style law that requires police to check immigration status. Hickenlooper vows to veto any such legislation.\par \par \uc2 Tancredo wants to require proof of citizenship to enroll in public schools. Hickenlooper opposes it. Tancredo wants limits on more federal stimulus spending. Hickenlooper points to money providing broadband access in rural areas and supports federal spending.\par \par \uc2 Tancredo has made a career out of rocking the boat on policy issues, beginning with education. He started out as a teacher in the Jefferson County school system and later became a real estate developer. In 1976, he was elected to the state Legislature, where he served two terms, driven by a desire to reform an education he saw as flawed because parents had no choice where their children went to school.\par \par \uc2 His education agenda earned him plaudits, and in 1981, President Ronald Reagan appointed him a regional assistant to the U.S. Secretary of Education, where he served until 1992. His goal: Slash the number of department employees. He did it with vigor, cutting staff from 225 to 60.\par \par \uc2 He promises to use the same budget ax with Colorado's 16 departments to confront a $1.1 billion budget shortfall next year.\par \par \uc2 In 1993, Tancredo became director of the Independence Institute, a private conservative think tank. He was elected to the U.S. House in 1998 and left in 2007 for a longshot run at the GOP presidential nomination.\par \par \uc2 Now Tancredo wants to bring back another notorious ad he ran during his presidential bid. The ad showed a man in a hooded sweat shirt with a backpack in a crowded mall, then the sound of an explosion, then clips of terrorist acts in Europe.\par \par \uc2 "I asked them to send me a copy because who knows, I might need it again," he said.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101020e6ak0029d\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 LAS VEGAS (AP) - A Republican campaign urging Latinos not to vote has been yanked from the airwaves amid an outcry from Democrats that it was a dirty trick against Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid in his hotly contested race against Republican Sharron Angle.\par \par \uc2 Reid sought to link the ad to Angle Tuesday as it drew a harsh rebuke from President Barack Obama, Hispanic leaders and candidates from both parties in Nevada. Angle's opponents also pounced on the tea party favorite for her comments to Hispanic high school students that "some of you look a little more Asian to me."\par \par \uc2 "Listen to her latest, running ads on Hispanic television telling people not to vote," Reid said. "She is trying to keep people from voting."\par \par \uc2 Reid has fiercely courted the Hispanic vote in the contest against Angle, who supports strict immigration policies. With the race in a dead heat, a dip in turnout among Hispanics would likely land Angle in the U.S. Senate.\par \par \uc2 The Republican group Latinos for Reform had planned to eventually run the commercials in Nevada, Florida, California, Texas and Colorado through the Nov. 2 election.\par \par \uc2 "Don't vote this November. This is the only way to send them a clear message," the ad's narrator announces in Spanish. "You can no longer take us for granted."\par \par \uc2 Univision told The Associated Press on Tuesday that the spot was pulled from one of its Spanish-language radio stations in Las Vegas shortly after the commercial hit the air.\par \par \uc2 Univision said it will also not run a companion ad on its Spanish-language TV broadcasting network and will continue to encourage Hispanics to vote.\par \par \uc2 Telemundo, the nation's other major Spanish-language network, also said it would not broadcast the TV spots if approached.\par \par \uc2 Obama slammed the campaign during a round-table with reporters from Spanish-language outlets.\par \par \uc2 "I think it is terrible," he said. "It is a cynical political ploy to try to drive Latino votes to benefit a Republican candidate in Nevada who would never vote for immigration reform."\par \par \uc2 Robert de Posada, the founder of Latinos for Reform, said he is trying to determine whether he can legally challenge Univision, which approved the commercials Friday.\par \par \uc2 "It is a very sad moment where you cannot have discourse in the Spanish market," he said. "Obviously, my First Amendment rights have been violated."\par \par \uc2 De Posada said Democrats were elected on empty promises of immigration reform in 2008. He also attacked Republican efforts to criminalize illegal immigrants or deny children of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 's citizenship rights, policies supported by Angle, whom he called "irresponsible."\par \par \uc2 "I would rather not vote for anyone than be forced to vote for the lesser of two evils," he said.\par \par \uc2 De Posada is the former director of Hispanic affairs for the Republican National Committee. He also worked on Social Security reform under former President George W. Bush, who supported an immigration overhaul that would have allowed illegal immigrants to apply for legal status.\par \par \uc2 Angle's campaign distanced itself from the ad, but stopped short of criticizing it.\par \par \uc2 "We encourage all Nevadans to vote and they should vote for Sharron Angle because Harry Reid is only out for himself and his wallet," said spokesman Jarrod Agen.\par \par \uc2 The ad flap was one of several major developments in the race:\par \par \uc2 -- A Canadian diplomat called on Angle to denounce her recent remarks that the "northern border is where the terrorists come through."\par \par \uc2 Angle's campaign insisted terrorists do enter the country through the northern border, citing the 1999 arrest of an Algerian convicted of trying to bomb Los Angeles International Airport on the millennium. A spokesman for the Canadian embassy said it was just one case that happened more than a decade ago.\par \par \uc2 -- Controversial Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio met with the Tea Party Express at a country bar Tuesday as it rolled through Las Vegas on its trip across the nation. Arpaio said President Barack Obama needs him to resolve the country's immigration crisis, and offered to help Nevada open its own tent city for detained illegal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 -- A group of U.S. senators that works to elect fellow Democrats released a TV spot urging Nevadans not to punish Reid for Nevada's woeful economy.\par \par \uc2 -- A third-party group called Crossroads GPS, backed by Republican operative Karl Rove, started airing a new TV spot in Nevada that blames Reid for the Silver State's stalled economy.\par \par \uc2 Hours after the Latino commercial was unveiled, the Nevada Democratic Party and Hispanic leaders in Las Vegas urged media outlets to boycott the ad. They called the spot un-American.\par \par \uc2 Hispanics make up more than 25 percent of Nevada's population and Democrats have directed intense voter outreach efforts toward the community in recent years.\par \par \uc2 Hispanics frustrated over unfulfilled promises on immigration reform could be receptive to the campaign's message, said John Tuman, chair of the political science department and director of the Latin American Studies Program at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101020e6ak0002k\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) - Buoyed by a surge in support from women and Latinos, Democrat Jerry Brown has taken a lead in the California governor's race, while the race between incumbent U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer and GOP challenger Carly Fiorina has tightened, according to a new poll.\par \par \uc2 The Public Policy Institute of California survey released late Wednesday found Brown with an 8-point lead over Whitman, 44 percent to 36 percent, among likely voters.\par \par \uc2 In the Senate race, the poll found Boxer continues to hold a slight advantage with likely voters over Fiorina, 43 percent to 38 percent, an edge that has diminished since September, when Boxer had a 7-point edge.\par \par \uc2 Independent voters are split in both races, and there is flagging support for the two measures on the November ballot that are drawing national attention.\par \par \uc2 Proposition 19, which would legalize recreational marijuana use in the state, has support from just 44 percent of likely voters, with almost half saying they will cast their ballots against it. That represents an 8-point drop in support since a previous PPIC poll in September.\par \par \uc2 Proposition 23, which would suspend California's landmark greenhouse gas emissions law until the unemployment rate falls to 5.5 percent for a year, has support from just 37 percent of likely voters, with 48 percent opposed. It is funded by out-of-state oil companies and is opposed by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and alternative-energy entrepreneurs.\par \par \uc2 The gubernatorial and Senate races have been characterized in recent weeks by nonstop attack ads on TV and campaign fliers flooding mailboxes throughout the state.\par \par \uc2 The campaigning is being driven largely by independent conservative groups spending in support of Fiorina, unions supporting Brown and a record-setting spending spree by Whitman, who has tapped her personal fortune for $142 million and has raised nearly $30 million more from outside contributors.\par \par \uc2 Whitman finds herself trailing the former two-term governor despite her enormous campaign account and extensive niche targeting of voters by gender, race and geography.\par \par \uc2 The poll found Brown with 51 percent support among Latinos, despite Whitman's aggressive targeting of them, and that women also favor Brown over Whitman 47 percent to 32 percent. Men and white voters are divided.\par \par \uc2 Brown campaign spokesman Sterling Clifford said the poll shows Brown's strategy of holding off on campaigning is paying off because many voters are only now tuning in.\par \par \uc2 "Jerry said from the beginning of this campaign, in the post-Labor Day period when people are paying attention, we'd be a lot more aggressive with Jerry's message of fiscal discipline of state government and growing the green economy," Clifford said. "They like what Jerry has to say."\par \par \uc2 Unions also have flooded voters' mail boxes with campaign literature critical of Whitman. A spokeswoman for her campaign declined to comment on the poll results.\par \par \uc2 The survey was taken after two controversies that roiled the governor's race -- the revelation that Whitman had an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  housekeeper for nine years and a leaked recording of a private conversation in which a Brown campaign aide called Whitman a "whore" for allegedly cutting a pension deal with law enforcement unions to get their endorsement.\par \par \uc2 In the Senate race, Fiorina said during a campaign stop this week that negative ads against her have not swayed voters. Her spokeswoman, Julie Soderlund, said Tuesday's poll shows Fiorina has the momentum.\par \par \uc2 "Barbara Boxer has hit her ceiling with voters, and on Nov. 2 she'll meet the floor when they sweep her out of office," Soderlund said.\par \par \uc2 Boxer campaign manager Rose Kapolczynski said the senator always expected the race to tighten in the final weeks.\par \par \uc2 "We've had a sustained pounding for the last two months, much of it by outside groups, and it takes a toll," Kapolczynski said. "The good news is we're still ahead, and we have a strong campaign here for the next 13 days."\par \par \uc2 The poll was conducted by telephone in English and Spanish from Oct. 10 to 17. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points for the 1,067 likely voters surveyed.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Associated Press Writers Judy Lin, Samantha Young, Kevin Freking and Robin Hindery also contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101020e6ak003af\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 LAS VEGAS (AP) - A Republican campaign urging Latinos not to vote was yanked from the airwaves Tuesday amid an outcry from Democrats that it was a dirty trick against Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid in his hotly contested race against Republican Sharron Angle.\par \par \uc2 Reid sought to link the ad to Angle as the ad drew a harsh rebuke from President Barack Obama, Hispanic leaders and candidates from both parties in Nevada. Angle's opponents also pounced on the tea party favorite for her comments to Hispanic high school students that "some of you look a little more Asian to me."\par \par \uc2 "Listen to her latest, running ads on Hispanic television telling people not to vote," Reid said. "She is trying to keep people from voting."\par \par \uc2 Reid has fiercely courted the Hispanic vote in the contest against Angle, who supports strict immigration policies. With the race in a dead heat, a dip in turnout among Hispanics would likely land Angle in the U.S. Senate.\par \par \uc2 The Republican group Latinos for Reform had planned to eventually run the commercials in Nevada, Florida, California, Texas and Colorado through the Nov. 2 election.\par \par \uc2 "Don't vote this November. This is the only way to send them a clear message," the ad's narrator announces in Spanish. "You can no longer take us for granted."\par \par \uc2 Univision told The Associated Press on Tuesday that the spot was pulled from one of its Spanish-language radio stations in Las Vegas shortly after the commercial hit the air.\par \par \uc2 Univision said it will also not run a companion ad on its Spanish-language TV broadcasting network and will continue to encourage Hispanics to vote.\par \par \uc2 Telemundo, the nation's other major Spanish-language network, also said it would not broadcast the TV spots if approached.\par \par \uc2 Obama slammed the campaign during a roundtable with reporters from Spanish-language outlets.\par \par \uc2 "I think it is terrible," he said. "It is a cynical political ploy to try to drive Latino votes to benefit a Republican candidate in Nevada who would never vote for immigration reform."\par \par \uc2 Robert de Posada, the founder of Latinos for Reform, said he is trying to determine whether he can legally challenge Univision, which approved the commercials Friday.\par \par \uc2 "It is a very sad moment where you cannot have discourse in the Spanish market," he said. "Obviously, my First Amendment rights have been violated."\par \par \uc2 De Posada said Democrats were elected on empty promises of immigration reform in 2008. He also attacked Republican efforts to criminalize illegal immigrants or deny children of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 's citizenship rights, policies supported by Angle, whom he called "irresponsible."\par \par \uc2 "I would rather not vote for anyone than be forced to vote for the lesser of two evils," he said.\par \par \uc2 De Posada is the former director of Hispanic affairs for the Republican National Committee. He also worked on Social Security reform under former President George W. Bush, who supported an immigration overhaul that would have allowed illegal immigrants to apply for legal status.\par \par \uc2 Angle's campaign distanced itself from the ad, but stopped short of criticizing it.\par \par \uc2 "We encourage all Nevadans to vote and they should vote for Sharron Angle because Harry Reid is only out for himself and his wallet," said spokesman Jarrod Agen.\par \par \uc2 The ad flap was one of several major developments in the race:\par \par \uc2 -- A Canadian diplomat called on Angle to denounce her recent remarks that the "northern border is where the terrorists come through."\par \par \uc2 Angle's campaign insisted terrorists do enter the country through the northern border, citing the 1999 arrest of an Algerian convicted of trying to bomb Los Angeles International Airport on the millennium. A spokesman for the Canadian embassy said it was just one case that happened more than a decade ago.\par \par \uc2 -- Controversial Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio was scheduled to meet with the Tea Party Express at a country bar as it rolls through Las Vegas on its trip across the nation.\par \par \uc2 -- A group of U.S. senators that works to elect fellow Democrats released a TV spot urging Nevadans not to punish Reid for Nevada's woeful economy.\par \par \uc2 Hours after the Latino commercial was unveiled, the Nevada Democratic Party and Hispanic leaders in Las Vegas urged media outlets to boycott the ad. They called the spot un-American.\par \par \uc2 Hispanics make up more than 25 percent of Nevada's population and Democrats have directed intense voter outreach efforts toward the community in recent years.\par \par \uc2 Hispanics frustrated over unfulfilled promises on immigration reform could be receptive to the campaign's message, said John Tuman, chair of the political science department and director of the Latin American Studies Program at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101019e6aj002t1\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 LAS VEGAS (AP) - Republican Sharron Angle's Senate campaign insisted Tuesday that terrorists do enter the U.S. through the northern border after a Canadian diplomat called on the tea party favorite to denounce her recent remarks against his country.\par \par \uc2 In a letter sent Monday to Angle's campaign, Gary Doer, Canada's ambassador to the United States, defended his country's border security and highlighted its ties to Nevada's trade and tourism industries.\par \par \uc2 "There have been no terrorist attacks on the United States coming from Canada," Doer wrote, citing a federal report on the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. "I can assure you that Canada takes border security very seriously and trust you will see fit to set the record straight."\par \par \uc2 Angle, who is in a tight race against Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, singled out the Canadian border while defending her campaign's anti-\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  ads during a talk to dozens of Hispanic teenagers last week. She said the ads were not necessarily about Hispanics and stressed that the "northern border is where the terrorists came through."\par \par \uc2 Angle's ads feature dark-skinned men and mentions of Mexico.\par \par \uc2 Campaign spokesman Jarrod Agen said terrorists have entered the U.S. through Canada. He singled out Ahmed Ressam, an Algerian who was convicted of trying to bomb Los Angeles International Airport in 1999.\par \par \uc2 But Hanni Nesser, a spokesman for the Canadian embassy, said Canada should not be portrayed as a terrorist portal because of one incident.\par \par \uc2 "Her comments were quite vague and she brushed it all with one stroke that terrorists were coming down from Canada," he said. "The point is the government of Canada takes all threats very seriously."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101019e6aj002c4\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SAN DIEGO (AP) - Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said Monday a 17 percent drop in Border Patrol arrests this year shows heightened enforcement is slowing illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 The Border Patrol made about 463,000 arrests during the federal government's fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, down from 556,032 the previous 12 months. It marks the fifth straight year of declines.\par \par \uc2 Border Patrol arrests are down 72 percent from nearly 1.7 million in 2000. The agency typically makes about 97 percent of its arrests along the 1,952-mile border with Mexico, with nearly all the rest coming along the Canadian border.\par \par \uc2 Napolitano said the weak economy helps explain why fewer people are getting caught crossing the border illegally, and she also credited enforcement against employers. But she said a big reason is enforcement under President Barack Obama -- including bringing the Border Patrol to an all-time high of 20,500 agents and dispatching 1,200 National Guard troops.\par \par \uc2 "The manpower, the technology, the infrastructure all has enabled us to be able to really slow that flow of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  traffic," she said at a news conference at the San Ysidro border crossing with Tijuana, Mexico.\par \par \uc2 Napolitano also said more drugs, weapons and illicit cash were being seized along the Mexican border.\par \par \uc2 "We now have a border more secure than ever before, and these efforts are only going to continue in the weeks, months and years ahead," she said.\par \par \uc2 Peter Nunez, a former U.S. attorney in San Diego who advocates a more restrictive immigration policy, noted that border enforcement has been building for 15 years. In the mid-1990s, President Bill Clinton launched a crackdown in San Diego and El Paso, Texas, that pushed migrants to remote mountains and deserts and made Arizona the busiest corridor for illegal crossings.\par \par \uc2 President George W. Bush doubled the size of the Border Patrol to 20,000 agents and, at one point, had 6,000 National Guard troops assigned to the border.\par \par \uc2 "It's been a long process over several administrations," said Nunez, who teaches immigration policy at University of San Diego. "They are reaping the rewards."\par \par \uc2 Enrique Morones, an activist who supports looser immigration policies, said the economy is the main reason for the five-year decline in arrests.\par \par \uc2 "If there are fewer jobs available, fewer people come," said Morones, president of Border Angels, which provides water to migrants crossing the border.\par \par \uc2 Morones said enforcement has discouraged people from crossing the border illegally to a much lesser extent. He said the crackdown has led to the deaths of many migrants who tried to evade the Border Patrol by crossing in remote areas in stifling heat.\par \par \uc2 Border Patrol arrests fell 42 percent in the San Diego region this year, to 68,568 from 118,708. The department did not provide numbers for other regions.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101019e6aj00041\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SAN DIEGO (AP) - Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said Monday that a 17 percent drop in Border Patrol arrests this year shows that heightened enforcement is slowing illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 The Border Patrol made about 463,000 arrests during the federal government's fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, down from 556,032 the previous 12 months. It marks the fifth straight year of declines.\par \par \uc2 Border Patrol arrests are down 72 percent from nearly 1.7 million in 2000. The agency typically makes about 97 percent of its arrests along the 1,952-mile border with Mexico, with nearly all the rest coming along the Canadian border.\par \par \uc2 Napolitano said the weak economy helps explain why fewer people are getting caught crossing the border illegally, and she also credited enforcement against employers. But she said a big reason is enforcement under President Barack Obama -- including bringing the Border Patrol to an all-time high of 20,500 agents and dispatching 1,200 National Guard troops.\par \par \uc2 "The manpower, the technology, the infrastructure all has enabled us to be able to really slow that flow of \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  traffic," she said at a news conference at the San Ysidro border crossing with Tijuana, Mexico.\par \par \uc2 Napolitano also said more drugs, weapons and illicit cash were being seized.\par \par \uc2 "We now have a border more secure than ever before, and these efforts are only going to continue in the weeks, months and years ahead," she said.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101018e6ai003y2\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 LAS VEGAS (AP) - Nevada U.S. Senate candidate Sharron Angle told dozens of Hispanic high school students last week that "some of you look a little more Asian to me," inducing gasps from the crowd and marking the latest eyebrow-raising remark she has uttered on the campaign trail.\par \par \uc2 Angle, a Republican in a close contest against Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, met Friday with the group at a Las Vegas high school after students expressed anger with her campaign's anti-\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  message.\par \par \uc2 In a video of the private meeting obtained by The Associated Press, Angle defends a series of campaign advertisements that lean on images of dark-skinned men. Angle, who is white and has Mexican grandsons, claims she did not know the people in the TV spots were Hispanic and makes the case that it can be difficult to pinpoint someone's race.\par \par \uc2 "You know, I don't know that all of you are Latino. Some of you look a little more Asian to me. I don't know that," she is heard telling the students, who respond with a flurry of gasps and whispers.\par \par \uc2 "What we know, what we know about ourselves is that we are a melting pot in this country. My grandchildren are evidence of that. I'm evidence of that. I've been called the first Asian legislator in our Nevada State Assembly."\par \par \uc2 She told the students that they are "misinterpreting" the commercials. "I'm not sure that those are Latinos in that commercial."\par \par \uc2 Angle also claimed she supported a state scholarship that benefited Hispanics, then later corrected herself and noted she voted against the scholarship as a state representative because it allowed non-citizens to receive taxpayer-subsidized tuition, according to the recording.\par \par \uc2 Rancho High School teacher Isaac Barron said the room of roughly 150 students was "rocked" by Angle's visit.\par \par \uc2 "Latinos do come in every shape and size," said Barron, whose Hispanic Student Union organized the event. "But it was shocking that she went out of her way to portray Hispanics in her commercials and then she calls us Asian."\par \par \uc2 Snippets of the brief high school visit have leaked out since Friday. Angle's campaign insisted the interlude not be recorded, but many students secretly taped the discussion on personal cell phones, Barron said. The AP obtained a complete copy of the event from students Monday.\par \par \uc2 Hispanics are a growing voting bloc in Nevada, where they make up roughly 25 percent of the population. More than 80 percent of the Silver State's Hispanics hail from Mexico.\par \par \uc2 Reid has attempted to present a balanced immigration record to voters. He has highlighted his votes to strengthen border security to mainstream audiences. To Hispanic crowds, he has vowed to make the road to citizenship more inclusive.\par \par \uc2 Angle's campaign spokesman said it is Reid's camp that is trying to play "race politics."\par \par \uc2 Hispanic leaders have blasted Angle's immigration stances.\par \par \uc2 On the tea party circuit, Angle has extolled strong-handed policies that might encourage illegal immigrants to "self-deport" and advocated for more sheriffs like Arizona's Joe Arpaio, who is under federal investigation for discriminating against Hispanics.\par \par \uc2 She has recently recast some of her more conservative images in the tight U.S. Senate race where Reid has tried to brand her "too extreme."\par \par \uc2 Angle's campaign has released more than four TV spots that accuse Reid of offering special breaks to illegal immigrants. In one campaign mailer, Reid is shown holding a map of Mexico with the word "amnesty" scribbled across the country.\par \par \uc2 One of the most criticized images, a still of three stony-faced Hispanic men from \uc2 Getty Images, Inc\uc2 , is of Mexican men in Mexico, according to the caption on the photography site.\par \par \uc2 Freshman Silvia Parra said she asked Angle on Friday to pull the "anti-Hispanic" commercials.\par \par \uc2 "She said, 'We don't have any anti-Hispanic ads,'" Parra recalled. "I feel like she kind of lied to me in front of my face."\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020101018e6ai002po\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600
