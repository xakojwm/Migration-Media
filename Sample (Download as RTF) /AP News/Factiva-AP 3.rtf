The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Minneapolis Star Tribune, Sept. 19\par \par \uc2 A weekend of inhumanity\par \par \uc2 When a man goes to a local shopping mall dressed as a security guard and stabs nine people while reportedly referencing Allah, the hardest thing for a population to do is to keep its collective cool. It is also the most necessary.\par \par \uc2 In recent years, the way jihadist terrorism threatens typical Americans has evolved into this: lone-wolf perpetrators, living in this country legally, not directed by terror groups but under their influence, pick a target where people congregate but that no one could know for certain is the spot that will be vulnerable.\par \par \uc2 The events on Saturday night at Crossroads Center in St. Cloud may be the latest example. Authorities are investigating the attack as "a potential act of terrorism," and a news agency thought to speak for the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant claimed credit. The perpetrator was identified by his father as Dahir A. Adan, who had been born in Africa but had lived in the U.S. for 15 years. He was shot dead by Jason Falconer, who has a background in law enforcement and who endangered his own life to save others at the mall.\par \par \uc2 Is America at war? Yes, in several senses. Beyond the explicit military efforts that began with Afghanistan and Iraq after 9/11, an amorphous struggle continues in the Middle East, mostly against ISIL.\par \par \uc2 But ISIL also has realized that it can call people overseas to its perceived task by declaring that no Westerner is innocent. In such an environment, it's hard not to believe that it's "us" against "them."\par \par \uc2 Yet it is crucial to accurately define "them," and this points to the role to which civilians are called in this era. Though terrorism's tactic is violence, its goal is to undermine unity. But the enemy is radicalism, not Islam in general, and in Minnesota especially, with its significant Somali diaspora, residents must take care not to conflate the two.\par \par \uc2 Beyond investigating Saturday's attack, there's an unending role for law enforcement in preventing violence through an uneasy mix of inquisitive attention and dedication to civil rights. There's also a role for government programs that help recent immigrants assimilate. As the Star Tribune Editorial Board has written, federal commitment to this effort is insufficient. That's especially frustrating for law enforcement in the Twin Cities, where terror recruiters have focused on the Somali population.\par \par \uc2 And there's a role for immigrants themselves, who must be alert to threatening activity in their communities. The rest of the public should realize what a difficult position this must be.\par \par \uc2 Though all these preventive measures are happening to some degree, people still cannot know when or where the next attack might occur. How horrible, the uncertainty of human volition.\par \par \uc2 Case in point: In New York on Saturday, a bomb injured 29 people. In this case, there was no claim of responsibility from a terror network. As of late Sunday, a "person of interest" reportedly had been identified, but no motive was publicly known.\par \par \uc2 The method of choice in St. Cloud was stabbing. In Manhattan, it was a pressure cooker altered to inflict maximum damage. It is a blessing that no innocent lives were lost in either place.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 The Journal of New Ulm, Sept. 19\par \par \uc2 Terrorism from within\par \par \uc2 Saturday night a young Somali-born man, identified by his family as Dahir A. Adan, started stabbing people in the Crossroads Mall in St. Cloud. Nine people were injured before an off-duty police officer shot and killed the attacker.\par \par \uc2 While law enforcement is still digging into the background of Adan and his motives for the attack, an Islamic State run news agency claimed Adan as "a soldier of the Islamic State." Adan could be a so-called "lone wolf" attacker, someone inspired by Islamic State's message but not directly controlled by IS.\par \par \uc2 This kind of attack feeds into the fears being whipped up by Donald Trump, who earlier Saturday was mournfully depicting a nation full of families with "empty chairs at the dinner table" because \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  criminals are being allowed to run free.\par \par \uc2 But in this case, the attacker is someone who came to America as a child of seven, and has lived here for 15 years. There are hundreds of thousands of young people like him, brought here to escape the terror and danger of their own homelands. Why this particular young man decided to turn to terrorism is an issue that needs to be investigated.\par \par \uc2 We cannot simply lump all Muslims, or all immigrants together and paint them as a suspicious mob to be isolated and discriminated against.\par \par \uc2 It is, however, a sad reality that there are others out there like Adan who feel the isolation, the suspicion and the threats of anti-Muslim hatred and may be willing to take similar action. It is our challenge to be aware, to report suspicious activity and not give in to fear.\par \par \uc2 We are glad that the nine victims of the St. Cloud attack are all alive and likely to recover. We hope this attack will provide an opportunity for discussions and connections among the diverse groups that make up our American citizenry, and lead to better understanding and more peaceful relations.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 The Free Press of Mankato, Sept. 19\par \par \uc2 Worthwhile program makes farmers safer\par \par \uc2 This week's state-declared observation of Farm Safety and Health Week takes special significance this year. During the most recent legislative session, a measure was passed to keep tractor drivers safer.\par \par \uc2 The Rollover Protective Structures Rebate Program is designed to prevent injuries and deaths caused by rollovers on farm equipment. The program helps reimburse farmers and schools that install roll bars and seat belts in tractors for better protection. Applicants' cost per tractor is limited to no more than $500 and the program helps identify the right kit for the vehicle.\par \par \uc2 U.S. Department of Labor\uc2  statistics cite tractor overturns as the leading cause of farmer fatalities. Roll bars and seat belts are 99 percent effective in preventing death and serious injury when a rollover occurs, according to the New York Center for Agricultural Medicine and Health, which administers Minnesota's program.\par \par \uc2 Prevention is a must for any type of workplace safety. The ag industry is especially vulnerable when it comes to injuries and fatalities as farmers work with an extensive amount of powerful machinery and dangerous scenarios, from suffocating grain bins to deadly power take-off shafts on tractors.\par \par \uc2 Between 2003 and 2013, workplace fatalities in Minnesota's agricultural industry rose by 30 percent, while another recent study found the occupational fatality rate for farmers is 800 percent higher than other industries, according to state figures.\par \par \uc2 The new rebate program \u8212\'20\'14 one of only seven in the nation \u8212\'20\'14 reimburses farmers and schools at least 70 percent of the cost of purchasing, shipping, and installing a rollover protection kit. The program is the result of a public private partnership with the state contributing $250,000 and private donations provided by Cargill, \uc2 CHS Inc\uc2 ., ADM and \uc2 Land O'Lakes\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Helping farmers make safety upgrades to their equipment to prevent death and injury makes a lot of sense in Minnesota where agriculture plays such a major role. As harvest gets under way this fall, farmers will be out in the fields, and this new program makes sure they are safer as they work hard to bring in the crops.\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020160919ec9j00d53\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

(AP) \u8212\'20\'14 Top Republican donor and fundraiser \uc2 Meg Whitman\uc2  has endorsed Democrat \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  for president, saying she cannot support a candidate who has "exploited anger, grievance, xenophobia and racial division."\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Hewlett-Packard\uc2  executive said in a statement Tuesday that Republican nominee \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 's "demagoguery has undermined the fabric of our national character."\par \par \uc2 "Trump's reckless and uninformed positions on critical issues - from immigration to our economy to foreign policy - have made it abundantly clear that he lacks both the policy depth and sound judgment required as president," Whitman said in a statement released Tuesday night. "Trump's unsteady hand would endanger our prosperity and national security.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 HILLSBOROUGH, N.C. (AP) \u8212\'20\'14 More than 200 people with no legal U.S. identification crammed into a North Carolina church on a recent Wednesday night to become part of an ID program created by immigration activists in partnership with police -- one community's response to a pressing issue for immigrants and officers alike.\par \par \uc2 With no ID, even commonplace transactions like cashing a check or visiting a health clinic may become impossible. And for police, stopping a person with no ID can mean a simple interaction suddenly becomes punitive.\par \par \uc2 Esperanza Moreno, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who lives in Durham, said people without IDs are frightened by reports of violence between officers and minorities they have seen on the news.\par \par \uc2 "We don't have the culture to know what to do when police stop you," she said as she waited in line for her photo to be taken.\par \par \uc2 The initiative began three years ago, after officials from the Greensboro-based interfaith immigration advocacy group FaithAction International House began talking with police about building bridges to the immigrant and minority communities.\par \par \uc2 They came up with FaithAction ID cards, in conjunction with meetings to help the police and immigrants talk with one another.\par \par \uc2 The nonprofit group issues the cards, which show a photo, full name, address, date of birth, country of origin and date of expiration. Participants must attend a meeting with police, where officers can explain checkpoints, traffic stops and address concerns about profiling to a group that often lives in shadows.\par \par \uc2 "Officers do have a job to do, and we as leaders expect them to do it respectfully and compassionately," Chapel Hill Police Chief Chris Blue told the crowd. "If any officer asks you to stay in the car, please stay in the car. If any officer asks you to step out of the car, please step out of the car. We know that's scary."\par \par \uc2 To obtain or renew an ID, people pay $10, bring a passport or national ID and a proof of address and sit for a photo. Once the information has been vetted by FaithAction workers and attorneys, participants receive the photo ID in about two weeks.\par \par \uc2 They aren't government IDs and can't substitute for driver's licenses, but officers say they can minimize complications during traffic stops or crime reports by confirming people are who they say they are and live where they say they live.\par \par \uc2 Local ID programs aimed at immigrant, homeless and ex-felons have emerged in major cities like Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York City, since New Haven, Connecticut, created the first in 2007.\par \par \uc2 North Carolina's model is gaining recognition among community organizers, because it is run by a nonprofit, rather than a government, and was launched with a meager $5,000 budget. FaithAction trains other community groups to host the drives in their regions, said program founder, the Rev. David Fraccaro. The program has issued more than 7,000 ID cards that are recognized by law enforcement, some health centers, schools, businesses and cultural organizations in 16 cities and 9 counties.\par \par \uc2 The FaithAction ID network has earned praise from North Carolina law enforcement and national recognition from advocacy groups in other major U.S. cities looking to emulate the model.\par \par \uc2 Cincinnati, Ohio, city leaders agreed this spring to accept nonprofit IDs from Metropolitan Area Religious Coalition of Cincinnati, a group of 17 religious organizations that worked closely with FaithAction to build the program.\par \par \uc2 Fraccaro and FaithAction representatives were also called to Houston last month to discuss the program with community organizations and immigration advocates. Laura Perez-Boston from Texas Organizing Project said the city might not have the means or political appetite for a municipal ID program, but leaders are considering "the Greensboro model."\par \par \uc2 Nevertheless, opponents in North Carolina's GOP-dominated General Assembly want to shut down the FaithAction ID program.\par \par \uc2 They think the cards represent local governments slackening immigration regulations in defiance of state law, and invite non-citizens to take advantage of the state's Medicaid, justice system and job markets.\par \par \uc2 Last year the General Assembly banned most government officials from accepting the FaithAction cards. A narrow exception was left for law enforcement, but the IDs' expanding popularity brought renewed attempts to eliminate them this year. Those efforts never won enough support.\par \par \uc2 Rep. George Cleveland, R -Onslow, who brought the bill and has backed tighter immigration policies, said he will return with legislation to eliminate the ID program again next year.\par \par \uc2 "It's an easy 'out' for law enforcement," Cleveland said. "I'm not here to make someone's job easier. We're here a country of laws."\par \par \uc2 Some police say the cards help immigrants work within the law.\par \par \uc2 The cards help victims report crimes without fear they will be arrested alongside the criminals for not having an ID, said Greensboro Police Capt. Mike Richey.\par \par \uc2 Ana Gomez of Durham obtained her card in June and said she has used it at a county health clinic, a bank and when she was stopped by a police officer for speeding.\par \par \uc2 "It's not like we don't trust them, it's like you don't trust yourself when you talk to them," Gomez said.\par \par \uc2 Fraccaro said every day brings new reasons to support a program like the ID cards.\par \par \uc2 "You open up that paper on any given day you'll see bad news about immigration, bad news about police-minority relationships," Fraccaro said. "This innovative, effective program is making a pretty significant difference on two of the most heated and complex issues in the United States."\par \par \uc2 In this photo taken Wednesday, July 13, 2016 Esperanza Moreno, left, listens carefully during a Faith Action ID drive at Holy Family Catholic Church in Hillsborough, N.C.

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc8}{\*\bkmkend toc8}\b \uc2 AP FACT CHECK: Trump resurfaces debunked claims in speech\b0\par\par\uc2 By CALVIN WOODWARD and MICHAEL BIESECKER  \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 2,080 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 July 2016\par 23:38\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2016.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.  \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) \u8212\'20\'14 Despite promising "the truth, and nothing else" in his convention speech, \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  presented the nation with a series of previously debunked claims and some new ones Thursday night \u8212\'20\'14 about the U.S. tax burden, the perils facing police, \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 's record and more.\par \par \uc2 A look at some of the Republican presidential candidate's claims and how they compare with the facts:\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: "Decades of progress made in bringing down crime are now being reversed by this administration's rollback of criminal enforcement. Homicides last year increased by 17 percent in America's 50 largest cities. That's the largest increase in 25 years."\par \par \uc2 THE FACTS: A rollback? President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  has actually achieved some big increases in spending for state and local law enforcement, including billions in grants provided through the 2009 stimulus. While \uc2 FBI\uc2  crime statistics for 2015 are not yet available, Trump's claim about rising homicides appears to come from a \uc2 Washington Post\uc2  analysis published in January. While Trump accurately quotes part of the analysis, he omits that the statistical jump was so large because homicides are still very low by historical standards. In the 50 cities cited by the Post, for example, half as many people were killed last year as in 1991.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: "The number of new \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  families who have crossed the border so far this year already exceeds the entire total from 2015. They are being released by the tens of thousands into our communities with no regard for the impact on public safety or resources."\par \par \uc2 THE FACTS: The pace of releasing immigrants is driven not by the Obama administration, but by a court ruling. A federal judge ruled last year that the government couldn't hold parents and children in jail for more than 20 days. An appeals court partially rolled that back earlier this month, saying that parents could be detained but children must be released.\par \par \uc2 By the standard used by the government to estimate illegal border crossings - the number of arrests \u8212\'20\'14 Trump is right that the number in this budget year has already exceeded last year's total. But it's down from 2014.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: "When a secretary of state illegally stores her emails on a private server, deletes 33,000 of them so the authorities can't see her crime, puts our country at risk, lies about it in every different form and faces no consequence - I know that corruption has reached a level like never before."\par \par \uc2 THE FACTS: Clinton's use of a private server to store her emails was not illegal under federal law. Her actions were not established as a crime. The \uc2 FBI\uc2  investigated the matter and its role was to advise the Justice Department whether to bring charges against her based on what it found. FBI Director James Comey declined to refer the case for criminal prosecution to the Justice Department, instead accusing Clinton of extreme carelessness.\par \par \uc2 As for Trump's claim that Clinton faces no consequence, that may be true in a legal sense. But the matter has been a distraction to her campaign and fed into public perceptions that she can't be trusted. The election will test whether she has paid a price politically.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: "The number of police officers killed in the line of duty has risen by almost 50 percent compared to this point last year."\par \par \uc2 THE FACTS: Not according to the \uc2 National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund\uc2 , which tracks police fatalities daily. The group found that the number of police officers who died as of July 20 is up just slightly this year, at 67, compared with 62 through the same period last year. That includes deaths in the line of duty from all causes, including traffic fatalities.\par \par \uc2 It is true that there has been a spike in police deaths from intentional shootings, 32 this year compared with 18 last year, largely attributable to the recent mass shootings in Dallas and Baton Rouge. But that was not his claim.\par \par \uc2 And overall, police are statistically safer on America's streets now than at any time in recent decades.\par \par \uc2 For example, the 109 law enforcement fatalities in 2013 were the lowest since 1956.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: "My opponent has called for a radical 550 percent increase in Syrian (refugees). ... She proposes this despite the fact that there's no way to screen these refugees in order to find out who they are or where they come from. I only want to admit individuals into our country who will support our values and love our people."\par \par \uc2 THE FACTS: Trump persists in making the bogus claim that the U.S. doesn't screen refugees. The administration both screens them and knows where they are from. The \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2  leads the process, which involves rigorous background checks. Processing of a refugee can take 18 months to two years, and usually longer for those coming from Syria. Refugees are also subject to in-person interviews and fingerprint and other biometric screening.\par \par \uc2 For all that caution, U.S. officials acknowledge that the Islamic State group could try to place operatives among refugees. Last year, FBI Director James Comey said data about people coming from Syria may be limited, adding, "If we don't know much about somebody, there won't be anything in our database."\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: "Two million more Latinos are in poverty today than when President Obama took his oath of office less than eight years ago. Another 14 million people have left the workforce entirely. ... President Obama has almost doubled our national debt to more than $19 trillion, and growing."\par \par \uc2 THE FACTS: Trump is playing with numbers to make the economy look worse than it actually is. The sluggish recovery over the past seven years has been frustrating. But with unemployment at 4.9 percent, the situation isn't as bleak as he suggests.\par \par \uc2 Trump's figure of 14 million who've stopped working since Obama took office comes from the Labor Department's measure of people not in the workforce. It's misleading for three reasons: The U.S. population has increased in that time; the country has aged and people have retired; and younger people are staying in school longer for college and advanced degrees, so they're not in the labor force, either.\par \par \uc2 A better figure is labor force participation \u8212\'20\'14 the share of people with jobs or who are searching for work. That figure has declined from 65.7 percent when Obama took office to 62.7 percent now. Part of that decrease reflects retirements, but the decline is also a long-term trend.\par \par \uc2 On national debt, economists say a more meaningful measure than dollars is the share of the overall economy taken up by the debt. By that measure, the debt rose 36 percent under Obama (rather than doubling). That's roughly the same as what occurred under Republican President George W. Bush.\par \par \uc2 The Hispanic population has risen since Obama while the poverty rate has fallen. The \uc2 Pew Research Center\uc2  found that 23.5 percent of the country's 55.3 million Latinos live in poverty, compared with 24.7 percent in 2010.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: "Another humiliation came when President Obama drew a red line in Syria, and the whole world knew it meant absolutely nothing."\par \par \uc2 THE FACTS: Trump's reference is to a threat by Obama for retaliatory strikes if Syrian President \uc2 Bashar Assad\uc2  used chemical weapons against rebels \u8212\'20\'14 and he's basically on target. When Assad crossed Obama's "red line" in 2013 by using chemical weapons, the U.S. president backed down.\par \par \uc2 Obama's two secretaries of state, \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  and \uc2 John Kerry\uc2 , pushed for intervention, as have a former defense secretary and CIA director. But Obama as commander-in-chief has the last word, and nothing has swayed him thus far.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: "When that same secretary of state rakes in millions and millions of dollars trading access and favors to special interests and foreign powers, I know the time for action has come."\par \par \uc2 THE FACTS: That's a somewhat overheated take on a legitimately troublesome issue for Clinton.\par \par \uc2 Although financial disclosures show she earned only her government salary as secretary of state, she made more than $21 million afterward, over three years, for speeches and appearances for private companies. None of those speeches was paid for by foreign governments, but some groups she addressed could be counted as special interests.\par \par \uc2 As well, the Clintons' family charity, the \uc2 Clinton Foundation\uc2 , received millions of dollars in donations while she was secretary of state, some from foreigners. And \uc2 Bill Clinton\uc2  earned millions making appearances and speeches for foreign corporations and organizations while his wife was at the State Department.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: "After four years of \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 , what do we have? ISIS has spread across the region, and the entire world. Libya is in ruins, and our ambassador and his staff were left helpless to die at the hands of savage killers. Egypt was turned over to the radical \uc2 Muslim Brotherhood\uc2 , forcing the military to retake control. Iraq is in chaos. Iran is on the path to nuclear weapons. Syria is engulfed in a civil war and a refugee crisis now threatens the West. ... This is the legacy of \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 : death, destruction, terrorism and weakness."\par \par \uc2 THE FACTS: It's an exaggeration to suggest Clinton, or any secretary of state, is to blame for the widespread instability and violence across the Middle East.\par \par \uc2 Clinton worked to impose sanctions that helped coax Tehran to a nuclear deal with the U.S. and other world powers last year, a deal in which Iran rolled back its nuclear program to get relief from sanctions that were choking its economy.\par \par \uc2 She did not start the war in Libya, but supported a \uc2 NATO\uc2  intervention well after violence broke out between rebels and the forces of dictator Moammar Gadhafi. The country slid into chaos after Gadhafi was ousted and killed in 2011, leaving it split between competing governments.\par \par \uc2 Clinton had no role in military decisions made during the 2012 attack on the U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya, that killed U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans. Republicans' claim that high-level officials in Washington issued a "stand-down" order delaying a military rescue in Benghazi has been widely debunked.\par \par \uc2 On Iraq, Clinton as a senator voted in 2002 to grant President George W. Bush authority to invade Iraq, but has since said it was a "mistake." Many in the Middle East do not regret Saddam's ouster and regional allies allowed U.S. bases in their country to support the war. But many also now fear the Islamic State group, which rose in the chaos of Syria's civil war and Iraq's security vacuum.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: "America is one of the highest-taxed nations in the world."\par \par \uc2 THE FACTS: Trump continues to repeat this inaccuracy. The U.S. tax burden is actually the fourth lowest among the 34 developed and large emerging-market economies that make up the \uc2 Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development\uc2 . Taxes made up 26 percent of the total U.S. economy in 2014, according to the \uc2 OECD\uc2 . That's far below Sweden's tax burden of 42.7 percent, Britain's 32.6 percent or Germany's 36.1 percent. Only three \uc2 OECD\uc2  members had a lower figure than the U.S.: Chile, South Korea and Mexico.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 TRUMP: "My opponent wants to essentially abolish the Second Amendment."\par \par \uc2 THE FACTS: \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  has not proposed any revocation of the constitutionally protected right to bear arms. She does support a ban on certain military-style weapons, similar to the law President \uc2 Bill Clinton\uc2  signed in the 1990s. That ban expired after 10 years and was not renewed. Clinton also backs an expansion of existing criminal background checks to apply to weapons sales at gun shows. The checks now apply mainly to sales by federally licensed gun dealers.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writers Josh Boak, Stephen Braun, Deb Riechmann, Jim Drinkard and Alicia A.

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc9}{\*\bkmkend toc9}\b \uc2 Text of \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 's speech to the GOP convention\b0\par\par\uc2 By The Associated Press \par \uc2 4,741 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 July 2016\par 23:24\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2016.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Text of presidential nominee \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 's speech to the Republican National Convention, as provided in advance by the Trump campaign.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 Friends, delegates and fellow Americans: I humbly and gratefully accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States.\par \par \uc2 Who would have believed that when we started this journey on June 16th of last year we - and I say "we" because we are a team - would have received almost 14 million votes, the most in the history of the Republican Party, and that the Republican Party would get 60 percent more votes than it received four years ago. The Democrats, on the other hand, received almost 20 percent fewer votes than they got eight years ago.\par \par \uc2 Together, we will lead our party back to the White House, and we will lead our country back to safety, prosperity, and peace. We will be a country of generosity and warmth. But we will also be a country of law and order.\par \par \uc2 Our Convention occurs at a moment of crisis for our nation. The attacks on our police, and the terrorism in our cities, threaten our very way of life. Any politician who does not grasp this danger is not fit to lead our country.\par \par \uc2 Americans watching this address tonight have seen the recent images of violence in our streets and the chaos in our communities.\par \par \uc2 Many have witnessed this violence personally, some have even been its victims.\par \par \uc2 I have a message for all of you: the crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soon come to an end. Beginning on January 20th, 2017, safety will be restored.\par \par \uc2 The most basic duty of government is to defend the lives of its own citizens. Any government that fails to do so is a government unworthy to lead.\par \par \uc2 It is finally time for a straightforward assessment of the state of our nation. I will present the facts plainly and honestly.\par \par \uc2 We cannot afford to be so politically correct anymore. So if you want to hear the corporate spin, the carefully-crafted lies, and the media myths_the Democrats are holding their convention next week.\par \par \uc2 But here, at our convention, there will be no lies. We will honor the American people with the truth, and nothing else.\par \par \uc2 These are the facts:\par \par \uc2 Decades of progress made in bringing down crime are now being reversed by this Administration's rollback of criminal enforcement. Homicides last year increased by 17 percent in America's fifty largest cities. That's the largest increase in 25 years.\par \par \uc2 In our nation's capital, killings have risen by 50 percent. They are up nearly 60 percent in nearby Baltimore. In the President's hometown of Chicago, more than 2,000 people have been the victims of shootings this year alone. And almost 4,000 have been killed in the Chicago area since he took office.\par \par \uc2 The number of police officers killed in the line of duty has risen by almost 50 percent compared to this point last year.\par \par \uc2 Nearly 180,000 illegal immigrants with criminal records, ordered deported from our country, are tonight roaming free to threaten peaceful citizens.\par \par \uc2 The number of new \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  families who have crossed the border so far this year already exceeds the entire total from 2015. They are being released by the tens of thousands into our communities with no regard for the impact on public safety or resources.\par \par \uc2 One such border-crosser was released and made his way to Nebraska. There, he ended the life of an innocent young girl named Sarah Root. She was 21 years old, and was killed the day after graduating from college with a 4.0 Grade Point Average. Her killer was then released a second time, and he is now a fugitive from the law.\par \par \uc2 I've met Sarah's beautiful family. But to this administration, their amazing daughter was just one more American life that wasn't worth protecting. One more child to sacrifice on the altar of open borders.\par \par \uc2 What about our economy?\par \par \uc2 Again, I will tell you the plain facts that have been edited out of your nightly news and your morning newspaper:\par \par \uc2 Nearly four in 10 African-American children are living in poverty, while 58% of African-American youth are not employed. 2 million more Latinos are in poverty today than when President \uc2 Obama\uc2  took his oath of office less than eight years ago. Another 14 million people have left the workforce entirely.\par \par \uc2 Household incomes are down more than 4 thousand dollars since the year 2000 - 16 years ago. Our trade deficit in goods reached nearly 800 billion dollars last year alone.\par \par \uc2 The budget is no better. President \uc2 Obama\uc2  has almost doubled our national debt to more than trillion dollars, and growing.\par \par \uc2 Yet, what do we have to show for it? Our roads and bridges are falling apart, our airports are in Third World condition, and 43 million Americans are on food stamps.\par \par \uc2 Now let us consider the state of affairs abroad.\par \par \uc2 Not only have our citizens endured domestic disaster, but they have lived through one international humiliation after another.\par \par \uc2 We all remember the images of our sailors being forced to their knees by their Iranian captors at gunpoint. This was just prior to the signing of the Iran deal, which gave back to Iran 150 billion dollars and gave us nothing - it will go down in history as one of the worst deals ever negotiated.\par \par \uc2 Another humiliation came when President \uc2 Obama\uc2  drew a red line in Syria - and the whole world knew it meant nothing.\par \par \uc2 In Libya, our consulate - the symbol of American prestige around the globe - was brought down in flames.\par \par \uc2 America is far less safe - and the world is far less stable - than when \uc2 Obama\uc2  made the decision to put \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  in charge of America's foreign policy. I am certain it is a decision he truly regrets.\par \par \uc2 Her bad instincts and her bad judgment - something pointed out by Bernie Sanders - are what caused so many of the disasters unfolding today.\par \par \uc2 Let's review the record. In 2009, pre-Hillary, ISIS was not even on the map. Libya was stable. Egypt was peaceful. Iraq was seeing a reduction in violence. Iran was being choked by sanctions. Syria was under control.\par \par \uc2 After four years of \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 , what do we have?\par \par \uc2 ISIS has spread across the region, and the world.\par \par \uc2 Libya is in ruins, and our Ambassador and his staff were left helpless to die at the hands of savage killers.\par \par \uc2 Egypt was turned over to the radical Muslim brotherhood, forcing the military to retake control.\par \par \uc2 Iraq is in chaos.\par \par \uc2 Iran is on the path to nuclear weapons.\par \par \uc2 Syria is engulfed in a civil war and a refugee crisis that now threatens the West.\par \par \uc2 After fifteen years of wars in the Middle East, after trillions of dollars spent and thousands of lives lost, the situation is worse than it has ever been before.\par \par \uc2 This is the legacy of \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 : death, destruction, terrorism and weakness.\par \par \uc2 But \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 's legacy does not have to be America's legacy.\par \par \uc2 The problems we face now - poverty and violence at home, war and destruction abroad - will last only as long as we continue relying on the same politicians who created them.\par \par \uc2 A change in leadership is required to produce a change in outcomes.\par \par \uc2 Tonight, I will share with you my plan of action for America.\par \par \uc2 The most important difference between our plan and that of our opponents, is that our plan will put America First.\par \par \uc2 Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo.\par \par \uc2 As long as we are led by politicians who will not put America First, then we can be assured that other nations will not treat America with respect.\par \par \uc2 This will all change when I take office.\par \par \uc2 The American People will come first once again.\par \par \uc2 My plan will begin with safety at home - which means safe neighborhoods, secure borders, and protection from terrorism. There can be no prosperity without law and order.\par \par \uc2 On the economy, I will outline reforms to add millions of new jobs and trillions in new wealth that can be used to rebuild America.\par \par \uc2 A number of these reforms that I will outline tonight will be opposed by some of our nation's most powerful special interests.\par \par \uc2 That is because these interests have rigged our political and economic system for their exclusive benefit.\par \par \uc2 Big business, elite media and major donors are lining up behind the campaign of my opponent because they know she will keep our rigged system in place.\par \par \uc2 They are throwing money at her because they have total control over everything she does.\par \par \uc2 She is their puppet, and they pull the strings.\par \par \uc2 That is why \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 's message is that things will never change.\par \par \uc2 My message is that things have to change - and they have to change right now.\par \par \uc2 Every day I wake up determined to deliver a better life for the people all across this nation that have been ignored, neglected and abandoned.\par \par \uc2 I have visited the laid-off factory workers, and the communities crushed by our horrible and unfair trade deals.\par \par \uc2 These are the forgotten men and women of our country. People who work hard but no longer have a voice.\par \par \uc2 I AM YOUR VOICE.\par \par \uc2 I have embraced crying mothers who have lost their children because our politicians put their personal agendas before the national good.\par \par \uc2 I have no patience for injustice, no tolerance for government incompetence, no sympathy for leaders who fail their citizens.\par \par \uc2 When innocent people suffer, because our political system lacks the will, or the courage, or the basic decency to enforce our laws - or worse still, has sold out to some corporate lobbyist for cash - I am not able to look the other way.\par \par \uc2 And when a Secretary of State illegally stores her emails on a private server, deletes 33,000 of them so the authorities can't see her crime, puts our country at risk, lies about it in every different form and faces no consequence - I know that corruption has reached a level like never before.\par \par \uc2 When the FBI Director says that the Secretary of State was "extremely careless" and "negligent," in handling our classified secrets, I also know that these terms are minor compared to what she actually did. They were just used to save her from facing justice for her terrible crimes.\par \par \uc2 In fact, her single greatest accomplishment may be committing such an egregious crime and getting away with it - especially when others, who have done far less, have paid so dearly.\par \par \uc2 When that same Secretary of State rakes in millions of dollars trading access and favors to special interests and foreign powers I know the time for action has come.\par \par \uc2 I have joined the political arena so that the powerful can no longer beat up on people who cannot defend themselves.\par \par \uc2 Nobody knows the system better than me, which is why I alone can fix it. I have seen firsthand how the system is rigged against our citizens, just like it was rigged against Bernie Sanders - he never had a chance. But his supporters will join our movement, because we will fix his biggest issue: trade deals that strip our country of its jobs and wealth.\par \par \uc2 Millions of Democrats will join our movement, because we are going to fix the system so it works fairly, and justly, for each and every American.\par \par \uc2 In this cause, I am proud to have at my side the next Vice President of the United States: Governor \uc2 Mike Pence\uc2  of Indiana.\par \par \uc2 We will bring the same economic success to America that Mike brought to Indiana.\par \par \uc2 He is a man of character and accomplishment. He is the right man for the job.\par \par \uc2 The first task for our new Administration will be to liberate our citizens from the crime and terrorism and lawlessness that threatens their communities.\par \par \uc2 America was shocked to its core when our police officers in Dallas were so brutally executed.\par \par \uc2 Immediately after Dallas, we have seen continued threats and violence against our law enforcement officials.\par \par \uc2 Law officers have been shot or killed in recent days in Georgia, Missouri, Wisconsin, Kansas, Michigan and Tennessee.\par \par \uc2 On Sunday, more police were gunned down in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.\par \par \uc2 Three were killed, and three were badly injured.\par \par \uc2 An attack on law enforcement is an attack on all Americans.\par \par \uc2 I have a message to every last person threatening the peace on our streets and the safety of our police: when I take the oath of office next year, I will restore law and order to our country.\par \par \uc2 I will work with, and appoint, the best and brightest prosecutors and law enforcement officials to get the job done.\par \par \uc2 In this race for the White House, I am the Law And Order candidate.\par \par \uc2 The irresponsible rhetoric of our President, who has used the pulpit of the presidency to divide us by race and color, has made America a more dangerous environment for everyone.\par \par \uc2 This Administration has failed America's inner cities. It's failed them on education. It's failed them on jobs. It's failed them on crime. It's failed them in every way and on every level.\par \par \uc2 When I am President, I will work to ensure that all of our kids are treated equally, and protected equally.\par \par \uc2 Every action I take, I will ask myself: does this make life better for young Americans in Baltimore, Chicago, Detroit, Ferguson who have the same right to live out their dreams as any other child in America?\par \par \uc2 To make life safe for all our citizens, we must also address the growing threats we face from outside the country: we are going to defeat the barbarians of ISIS.\par \par \uc2 Once again, France is the victim of brutal Islamic terrorism. Men, women and children viciously mowed down. Lives ruined. Families ripped apart. A nation in mourning.\par \par \uc2 The damage and devastation that can be inflicted by Islamic radicals has been proven over and over - at the World Trade Center, at an office party in San Bernardino, at the Boston Marathon, at a military recruiting center in Chattanooga, and many more.\par \par \uc2 Only weeks ago, in Orlando, Florida, 49 wonderful Americans were savagely murdered by an Islamic terrorist. This time, the terrorist targeted our LGBTQ community.\par \par \uc2 As your President, I will do everything in my power to protect our LGBTQ citizens from the violence and oppression of a hateful foreign ideology.\par \par \uc2 To protect us from terrorism, we need to focus on three things.\par \par \uc2 We must have the best intelligence-gathering operation in the world.\par \par \uc2 We must abandon the failed policy of nation-building and regime change that \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  pushed in Iraq, Libya, Egypt and Syria. Instead, we must work with all of our allies who share our goal of destroying ISIS and stamping out Islamic terror. This includes working with our greatest ally in the region, the State of Israel.\par \par \uc2 Recently I have said that \uc2 NATO\uc2  was obsolete, because it did not properly cover terror, and also, that many of the member countries were not paying their fair share. As usual, the United States has been picking up the cost.\par \par \uc2 Shortly thereafter, it was announced that \uc2 NATO\uc2  will be setting up a new program in order to combat terrorism -- a true step in the right direction.\par \par \uc2 Lastly, we must immediately suspend immigration from any nation that has been compromised by terrorism until such time as proven vetting mechanisms have been put in place.\par \par \uc2 My opponent has called for a radical 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees on top of existing massive refugee flows coming into our country under President \uc2 Obama\uc2 . She proposes this despite the fact that there's no way to screen these refugees in order to find out who they are or where they come from.\par \par \uc2 I only want to admit individuals into our country who will support our values and love our people. Anyone who endorses violence, hatred or oppression is not welcome in our country and never will be.\par \par \uc2 Decades of record immigration have produced lower wages and higher unemployment for our citizens, especially for African-American and Latino workers.\par \par \uc2 We are going to have an immigration system that works, but one that works for the American people.\par \par \uc2 On Monday, we heard from three parents whose children were killed by illegal immigrants_Mary Ann Mendoza, Sabine Durden, and Jamiel Shaw.\par \par \uc2 They are just three brave representatives of many thousands who have suffered so gravely.\par \par \uc2 Of all my travels in this country, nothing has affected me more deeply than the time I have spent with the mothers and fathers who have lost their children to violence spilling across our border.\par \par \uc2 These families have no special interests to represent them.\par \par \uc2 There are no demonstrators to protest on their behalf.\par \par \uc2 My opponent will never meet with them, or share in their pain.\par \par \uc2 Instead, my opponent wants Sanctuary Cities.\par \par \uc2 But where was the sanctuary for Kate Steinle?\par \par \uc2 Where was the Sanctuary for the children of Mary Ann, Sabine and Jamiel?\par \par \uc2 Where was the Sanctuary for all the other Americans who have been so brutally murdered, and who have suffered so horribly?\par \par \uc2 These wounded American families have been alone.\par \par \uc2 But they are alone no longer.\par \par \uc2 Tonight, this candidate and the whole nation stand in their corner to support them, to send them our love, and to pledge in their honor that we will save countless more families from suffering the same awful fate.\par \par \uc2 We are going to build a great border wall to stop illegal immigration, to stop the gangs and the violence, and to stop the drugs from pouring into our communities.\par \par \uc2 I have been honored to receive the endorsement of America's Border Patrol Agents, and will work directly with them to protect the integrity of our lawful immigration system.\par \par \uc2 By ending catch-and-release on the border, we will end the cycle of human smuggling and violence. Illegal border crossings will go down. Peace will be restored.\par \par \uc2 By enforcing the rules for the millions who overstay their visas, our laws will finally receive the respect they deserve.\par \par \uc2 Tonight, I want every American whose demands for immigration security have been denied - and every politician who has denied them - to listen very closely to the words am about to say.\par \par \uc2 On January 20th of 2017, the day I take the oath of office, Americans will finally wake up in a country where the laws of the United States are enforced.\par \par \uc2 We are going to be considerate and compassionate to everyone. But my greatest compassion will be for our own struggling citizens.\par \par \uc2 My plan is the exact opposite of the radical and dangerous immigration policy of \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Americans want relief from uncontrolled immigration. Communities want relief. Yet \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  is proposing mass amnesty, mass immigration, and mass lawlessness.\par \par \uc2 Her plan will overwhelm your schools and hospitals, further reduce your jobs and wages, and make it harder for recent immigrants to escape from poverty and join the middle class.\par \par \uc2 I have a different vision for our workers.\par \par \uc2 It begins with a new, fair trade policy that protects our jobs and stands up to countries that cheat.\par \par \uc2 It's been a signature message of my campaign from day one, and it will be a signature feature of my presidency from the moment I take the oath of office.\par \par \uc2 I have made billions of dollars in business making deals - now I'm going to make our country rich again.\par \par \uc2 I am going to turn our bad trade agreements into great trade agreements.\par \par \uc2 America has lost nearly one-third of its manufacturing jobs since 1997, following the enactment of disastrous trade deals supported by Bill and \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Remember, it was \uc2 Bill Clinton\uc2  who signed \uc2 NAFTA\uc2 , one of the worst economic deals ever made by our country.\par \par \uc2 Never again.\par \par \uc2 I am going to bring back our jobs to Ohio, and Pennsylvania, and New York, and Michigan and to all of America - and I am not going to let companies move to other countries, firing their employees along the way, without consequence.\par \par \uc2 My opponent, on the other hand, has supported virtually every trade agreement that has been destroying our middle class.\par \par \uc2 She supported \uc2 NAFTA\uc2 , and she supported China's entrance into the \uc2 World Trade Organization\uc2  - another one of her husband's colossal mistakes.\par \par \uc2 She supported the job-killing trade deal with South Korea.\par \par \uc2 She has supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership - which will not only destroy our manufacturing, but it will make America subject to the rulings of foreign governments.\par \par \uc2 I pledge to never sign any trade agreement that hurts our workers, or that diminishes our freedom and independence.\par \par \uc2 Instead, I will make individual deals with individual countries. No longer will we enter into these massive transactions, with many countries, that are thousands of pages long - and which no one from our country even reads or understands.\par \par \uc2 We are going to enforce all trade violations against any country that cheats.\par \par \uc2 This includes stopping China's outrageous theft of intellectual property, along with their illegal product dumping, and their devastating currency manipulation.\par \par \uc2 Our horrible trade agreements with China, and many others, will be totally renegotiated.\par \par \uc2 That includes renegotiating \uc2 NAFTA\uc2  to get a much better deal for America - and we'll walk away if we don't get the deal that we want.\par \par \uc2 Our country is going to start building and making things again.\par \par \uc2 Next comes the reform of our tax laws, regulations and energy rules.\par \par \uc2 While \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  plans a massive tax increase, I have proposed the largest tax reduction of any candidate who has run for president this year - Democrat or Republican.\par \par \uc2 Middle-income Americans and businesses will experience profound relief, and taxes will be greatly simplified for everyone.\par \par \uc2 America is one of the highest-taxed nations in the world. Reducing taxes will cause new companies and new jobs to come roaring back into our country.\par \par \uc2 Then we are going to deal with the issue of regulation, one of the greatest job-killers of them all. Excessive regulation is costing our country as much as 2 trillion dollars a year, and we will end it.\par \par \uc2 We are going to lift the restrictions on the production of American energy.\par \par \uc2 This will produce more than 20 trillion dollars in job-creating economic activity over the next four decades.\par \par \uc2 My opponent, on the other hand, wants to put the great miners and steel workers of our country out of work - that will never happen when I am President.\par \par \uc2 With these new economic policies, trillions of dollars will start flowing into our country.\par \par \uc2 This new wealth will improve the quality of life for all Americans.\par \par \uc2 We will build the roads, highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, and the railways of tomorrow. This, in turn, will create millions more jobs.\par \par \uc2 We will rescue kids from failing schools by helping their parents send them to a safe school of their choice.\par \par \uc2 My opponent would rather protect bureaucrats than serve American children.\par \par \uc2 We will repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare. You will be able to choose your own doctor again.\par \par \uc2 And we will fix TSA at the airports!\par \par \uc2 We're going to work with all of our students who are drowning in debt to take the pressure off these young people just starting out their adult lives.\par \par \uc2 We will completely rebuild our depleted military, and the countries that we are protecting, at a massive cost to us, will be asked to pay their fair share.\par \par \uc2 We will take care of our great Veterans like they have never been taken care of before. My just-released Ten Point Plan has received tremendous veteran support. We will guarantee those who serve this country will be able to visit the doctor or hospital of their choice. My opponent dismissed the VA scandal - one more sign of how out of touch she really is.\par \par \uc2 We are going to ask every Department head in government to provide a list of wasteful spending projects that we can eliminate in my first 100 days.\par \par \uc2 The politicians have talked about it, I'm going to do it.\par \par \uc2 We are also going to appoint justices to the \uc2 United States Supreme Court\uc2  who will uphold our laws and our Constitution.\par \par \uc2 The replacement of our beloved Justice Scalia will be a person of similar views, principles, and judicial philosophy. This will be one of the most important issues decided by this election.\par \par \uc2 My opponent wants to essentially abolish the 2nd amendment. I, on the other hand, received the early and strong endorsement of the \uc2 National Rifle Association\uc2  and will protect the right of all Americans to keep their families safe.\par \par \uc2 At this moment, I would like to thank the evangelical and religious community in general who have been so good to me and so supportive.\par \par \uc2 You have much to contribute to our politics, yet our laws prevent you from speaking your minds from your own pulpits.\par \par \uc2 An amendment, pushed by Lyndon Johnson, many years ago, threatens religious institutions with a loss of their tax-exempt status if they openly advocate their political views. I am going to work very hard to repeal that language and protect free speech for all Americans.\par \par \uc2 We can accomplish these great things, and so much more - all we need to do is start believing in ourselves and in our country again.\par \par \uc2 It is time to show the whole world that America Is Back - bigger, and better and stronger than ever before.\par \par \uc2 In this journey, I'm so lucky to have at my side my wife Melania and my wonderful children, Don, Ivanka, Eric, Tiffany, and Barron: you will always be my greatest source of pride and joy.\par \par \uc2 My Dad, Fred Trump, was the smartest and hardest working man I ever knew. I wonder sometimes what he'd say if he were here to see this tonight.\par \par \uc2 It's because of him that I learned, from my youngest age, to respect the dignity of work and the dignity of working people. He was a guy most comfortable in the company of bricklayers, carpenters, and electricians and I have a lot of that in me also.\par \par \uc2 Then there's my mother, Mary. She was strong, but also warm and fair-minded.\par \par \uc2 She was a truly great mother. She was also one of the most honest and charitable people have ever known, and a great judge of character.\par \par \uc2 To my sisters Mary Anne and Elizabeth, my brother Robert and my late brother Fred, I will always give you my love_you are most special to me.\par \par \uc2 I have had a truly great life in business.\par \par \uc2 But now, my sole and exclusive mission is to go to work for our country - to go to work for you.\par \par \uc2 It's time to deliver a victory for the American people.\par \par \uc2 But to do that, we must break free from the petty politics of the past.\par \par \uc2 America is a nation of believers, dreamers, and strivers that is being led by a group of censors, critics, and cynics.\par \par \uc2 Remember: all of the people telling you that you can't have the country you want, are the same people telling you that I wouldn't be standing here tonight.\par \par \uc2 No longer can we rely on those same people in the media, and politics, who will say anything to keep a rigged system in place.\par \par \uc2 Instead, we must choose to Believe In America.\par \par \uc2 History is watching us now. It's waiting to see if we will rise to the occasion, and if we will show the whole world that America is still free and independent and strong.\par \par \uc2 I'm asking for your support tonight so that I can be your champion in the White House.\par \par \uc2 My opponent asks her supporters to recite a three-word loyalty pledge. It reads: "I'm With Her."\par \par \uc2 I choose to recite a different pledge.\par \par \uc2 My pledge reads: "I'M WITH YOU - THE AMERICAN PEOPLE."\par \par \uc2 I am your voice.\par \par \uc2 So to every parent who dreams for their child, and every child who dreams for their future, I say these words to you tonight:\par \par \uc2 I'm with you, I will fight for you, and I will win for you.\par \par \uc2 To all Americans tonight, in all of our cities and in all of our towns, I make this promise:\par \par \uc2 We Will Make America Strong Again.\par \par \uc2 We Will Make America Proud Again.\par \par \uc2 We Will Make America Safe Again.\par \par \uc2 And We Will Make America Great Again.\par \par \uc2 God Bless You And Good Night.\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020160722ec7m002bf\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

(AP) \u8212\'20\'14 Sedgwick County commissioners on Wednesday approved a resolution asking the Kansas Legislature to stop people living in the U.S. illegally from receiving in-state tuition or from receiving nutritious food through a federal program.\par \par \uc2 The nonbinding resolution passed 3-2 Wednesday after almost two hours of sometimes heated debate, with most speakers opposing the move, The Wichita \uc2 Eagle\uc2  reported ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://bit.ly/29yWiJg"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://bit.ly/29yWiJg}}}\uc2  ).\par \par \uc2 Karl Peterjohn\uc2 , \uc2 Richard Ranzau\uc2  and commission Chairman Jim Howell voted for the resolution while Dave Unruh and \uc2 Tim Norton\uc2  voted against it.\par \par \uc2 "This is not local, this is arbitrary; it's unnecessary, and it just looks like it's mean-spirited," speaker Roger Hughey told the commissioners.\par \par \uc2 Ranzau argued the resolution was about respect for the country.\par \par \uc2 "This has nothing to do with race, has nothing to do with being unkind or uncompassionate," Ranzau said. "It is about the law."\par \par \uc2 Commissioners who supported the resolution said they want a clear directive from state lawmakers about how to deal with issues involving those in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 State law allows the immigrants to receive in-state tuition if they attend a Kansas high school for three years and graduate. And federal law allows the state to determine who is eligible for the Women, Infants and Children program.\par \par \uc2 A group called Kansas Stronger Together issued a news release Tuesday asking commissioners to reject the resolution. The coalition said preventing those who are here illegally from receiving in-state tuition would deprive Kansas of skilled, taxpaying workers.\par \par \uc2 "In today's economy, we need a work force with skilled workers, and a college degree is a precursor to working, paying taxes and contributing to our state," the group wrote in a letter to Howell.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 Information from: The Wichita (Kan.) \uc2 Eagle\uc2 , {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.kansas.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.kansas.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020160706ec7600e4g\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 MADISON, Wis. (AP) \u8212\'20\'14 Immigrant advocates criticized the Wisconsin Supreme Court for upholding Wednesday a drunken driver's 15-year sentence that advocates say unduly took into account the man's lack of citizenship.\par \par \uc2 Leopoldo Salas Gayton, a Mexican immigrant who is in the U.S. illegally, pleaded no contest to charges of homicide by intoxicated use of a vehicle and causing death while operating without a license after he killed a woman in 2011 while driving the wrong direction on a Milwaukee freeway while drunk.\par \par \uc2 At a sentencing hearing in July 2011, Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Dennis Cimpl mentioned Salas Gayton's immigration status multiple times, saying his status as an "illegal alien" is a minor factor but relates to his character.\par \par \uc2 In a post-conviction motion, Salas Gayton argued the court improperly considered his immigration status in giving him the maximum sentence, but the circuit court and the 1st District Court of Appeals said that wasn't the case. The high court affirmed those courts' decisions Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 The Wisconsin Supreme Court's opinion doesn't clearly answer whether a sentencing court may rely on a defendant's "\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  status" as a factor in fashioning a sentence.\par \par \uc2 It does emphasize the circuit court's reliance on issues other than Salas Gayton's immigration status, concluding the harsh sentence was imposed because of his "dangerous conduct operating a vehicle while intoxicated and the tragic consequences of that act."\par \par \uc2 "The fact that you're an illegal alien doesn't enter into the serious nature of the crime or the need to protect the community," Cimpl said, according to a transcript included in the opinion. "It goes to character. It's a minor character flaw very honestly."\par \par \uc2 Justice David Prosser wrote for the majority that it's acceptable for the circuit court to include Salas Gayton's prior disregard for federal immigration law and his subsequent inability to obtain a driver's license in its assessment of his character.\par \par \uc2 Advocates for immigrants in Wisconsin argued Wednesday that the circuit court imposed the maximum sentence for Salas Gayton based in part on his status as a noncitizen.\par \par \uc2 "We continue to believe that sentencing a defendant based on immigration status or national origin, rather than on any specific actions, is an Equal Protection violation," Matthew Pinix, a volunteer attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union of Wisconsin, said in a statement.\par \par \uc2 Justice Ann Walsh Bradley wrote in a concurring opinion that the law on whether sentencing courts can rely on immigration status "is not well-settled," pointing to some courts that clearly prohibit relying on immigration status to increase a penalty and others that are far less clear.\par \par \uc2 Bradley wrote the practice may lead sentencing courts down "a slippery slope, potentially raising significant constitutional concerns."\par \par \uc2 Salas Gayton's attorney, Heather Johnson, didn't respond to a voicemail seeking comment.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 Follow Bryna Godar on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://twitter.com/bgodar"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://twitter.com/bgodar}}}\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020160706ec7600b6t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) \u8212\'20\'14 The Latest on the U.S. presidential campaign. (all times EDT):\par \par \uc2 4:30 p.m.\par \par \uc2 Sen. Bernie Sanders is thinking about "Where we go from here."\par \par \uc2 His presidential campaign says that's the theme of his press conference Thursday in New York. Sanders, who has not formally left the presidential race or endorsed presumed nominee \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 , acknowledged Wednesday that he's apparently not going to be the party's nominee.\par \par \uc2 Democrats, including House Democratic Leader \uc2 Nancy Pelosi\uc2  and Rep. James E. Clyburn, earlier Wednesday nudged Sanders to endorse Clinton.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 4:15 p.m.\par \par \uc2 House Democratic leader \uc2 Nancy Pelosi\uc2  says she hopes Bernie Sanders endorses \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  before the national convention in July.\par \par \uc2 Speaking to reporters Wednesday, Pelosi says the Vermont senator "knows what's at stake" in November. "Two words: \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 ," she said.\par \par \uc2 Sanders said in a \uc2 C-SPAN\uc2  interview that he won't be the nominee, but he hasn't officially bowed out and endorsed Clinton, the presumptive nominee after her primary wins earlier this month.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 3:20 p.m.\par \par \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  says \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  is going after her personally because he doesn't have any answers on the substance of the campaign.\par \par \uc2 Clinton says at a rally in Raleigh, North Carolina, that Trump is pedaling "outlandish lies" and is trying to "distract us." She says, "That's why he's attacking my faith. Sigh."\par \par \uc2 Clinton says he is attacking "a philanthropic foundation" that saves and improves lives around the world while his business products rely on poor people around the globe.\par \par \uc2 She says the nation can't allow Trump to "bankrupt America" the way he "bankrupted his casinos." Clinton says the nation needs to "write a new chapter in the American dream and it can't be Chapter 11," a reference to Trump's use of the bankruptcy laws in the past.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 2:49 p.m.\par \par \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  is outlining her plans for the U.S. economy in an address to supporters in Raleigh, North Carolina, hours after \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  questioned her credentials to be president.\par \par \uc2 Clinton says the nation needs better-paying jobs, debt-free college, steps to allow companies to share their profits with workers, ensuring Wall Street and corporations pay their fair share in taxes and policies to help families.\par \par \uc2 Clinton says the nation needs to "make sure that our economy works for everyone, not just for the rich or the well-connected."\par \par \uc2 The former secretary of state says she is offering an alternative to Trump, whom she says is spouting "reckless ideas that will run up our debt and cause another economic crash."\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 2:35 p.m.\par \par \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  is invoking her religion a day after \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  questioned it.\par \par \uc2 The presumptive presidential nominee told supporters in Raleigh, N.C., that, "As we Methodists like to say: do all the good you can for all the people you can in all the ways you can." That's a quote credited to John Wesley, the founder of Methodism.\par \par \uc2 Clinton was campaigning in North Carolina after Trump's scathing critique of her foreign policy record and her qualifications to be president.\par \par \uc2 According to video of the closed-door speech, Trump told evangelicals in New York that the public doesn't know "anything about Hillary in terms of religion."\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 2:14 p.m.\par \par \uc2 Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is all but acknowledging that \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  will be the Democratic nominee.\par \par \uc2 Sanders tells \uc2 C-SPAN\uc2 , "It doesn't appear that I'm going be the nominee." But he is urging Clinton to pick a running mate who he considers to be liberal. He says it would be a "terrible mistake for her to go to a candidate who has roots in Wall Street or has been backed by Wall Street."\par \par \uc2 The senator says he expects to speak at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. He says his campaign is trying to create the "most progressive platform" and change the party's use of "superdelegates" who help determine the nominee.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 12:40 p.m.\par \par \uc2 A top Republican official says he is worried that some party leaders may help rebellious delegates who are hoping to derail \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 's presidential nomination at next month's GOP national convention.\par \par \uc2 Bruce Ash\uc2  is one of Arizona's three members of the 168-member \uc2 Republican National Committee\uc2 , and an expert on party rules.\par \par \uc2 In a letter he's distributed to other GOP leaders, Ash says he's worried that some party officials who will head the convention's rules committee "might possibly work to deny" Trump the nomination "he has earned." The letter was obtained by The Associated Press.\par \par \uc2 Some conservative delegates have begun a long-shot effort to block Trump's nomination. They want to change the party's rules and let delegates vote for whichever candidate they want.\par \par \uc2 Ash writes that party leaders "must stand by our presumptive nominee's side and defend against all who would threaten our legitimacy as a national party."\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 12:25\par \par \uc2 Curious about what a two-woman presidential ticket might look like?\par \par \uc2 Democrats \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  and Sen. Elizabeth Warren are offering a glimpse at a campaign event Monday in battleground Ohio.\par \par \uc2 Warren is on Clinton's shortlist of prospective running mates. The Massachusetts senator is a favorite of progressives and has emerged as a ferocious critic of presumed Republican nominee \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 . Clinton said Wednesday that the pair will discuss "an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top" at the Cincinnati event.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 12:10 p.m.\par \par \uc2 Xavier Becerra, a Democratic leader in the House, says he is not currently being vetted as a potential running mate for \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "I really don't have knowledge," Becerra, of California, said before acknowledging that he has not been notified by the campaign that he is under consideration.\par \par \uc2 Other potential contenders, including Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro have been informed that Clinton has begun vetting them for the role.\par \par \uc2 His colleagues ribbed him for pouring Clinton a glass of water at a meeting with House Democrats on Capitol Hill on Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 "It was a thing of beauty," joked Joe Crowley, D-N.Y., who shouted, "you're really working it," in the meeting.\par \par \uc2 South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn added: "He absolutely a stand-up kind of guy. If he's not being vetted, I hope he will be."\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 11:30 a.m.\par \par \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  says he would "appoint judges who uphold the Constitution," reform the nation's immigration policies and repeal the Affordable Care Act in the first 100 days of his administration.\par \par \uc2 He also said he would toughen the nation's trade policies, lift restrictions on energy productions and overhaul the nation's tax code.\par \par \uc2 And in a swipe at Democratic opponent \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 , he says he would "impose tough new ethics rules to restore dignity to the office of the secretary of state."\par \par \uc2 Trump's speech Wednesday at a hotel he owns in Manhattan was largely a wide-ranging attack on Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee.\par \par \uc2 As part of it, he read a letter from a woman whose son was killed by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who says Clinton "needs to go to prison to pay for the crimes she has already committed against this country."\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 11:25 a.m.\par \par \uc2 House Democratic leaders are making a show of unity in their support for \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  after the presumptive presidential nominee met with them on Capitol Hill.\par \par \uc2 They were drawing a comparison with the lukewarm support \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  has received from top Republican lawmakers.\par \par \uc2 "You saw the stark contrast: unity vs. disorganization, lack of confidence in the other party in their leader," said Steny Hoyer, the No. 2 Democrat in the House.\par \par \uc2 Another congressman, Jim McDermott of Washington, said Clinton talked about the importance of winning not just the White House, but elections for the House and Senate.\par \par \uc2 He said Clinton told lawmakers: "I know the difference between having the House and not having the House, and I want the House."\par \par \uc2 Democrats face an uphill battle to retake the House, with better prospects for capturing the Senate.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 11:10 a.m.\par \par \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  says, "no secretary of state has been more wrong, more often, and in more places than \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 ."\par \par \uc2 Trump is slamming Clinton during a speech in New York, saying the decisions made by his general election foe at the State Department "spread death, destruction and terrorism everywhere she touched."\par \par \uc2 In particular, Trump blamed the death of four Americans at a U.S. facility in Benghazi, Libya, on Clinton. Among those who died was U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens.\par \par \uc2 Trump says Clinton "slept soundly in her bed" while Stevens was killed.\par \par \uc2 A Senate investigation later found that Stevens had asked for more security, which went unheeded. But he also twice declined the U.S. military's offer of a special operations team to bolster security and otherwise help his staff.\par \par \uc2 The month after the fatal assault, Clinton said she had been responsible for the safety of those serving in Benghazi, but did not acknowledging any specific mistakes on her part.\par \par \uc2 President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  also said the blame ultimately rested on his shoulders as president.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 10:55 a.m.\par \par \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  says \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  is "a world-class liar."\par \par \uc2 In a speech he's delivering Wednesday in New York, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee criticized what he called several lies made by his general election opponent.\par \par \uc2 Among them: Trump says Clinton misrepresenting the danger she faced during an airport arrival in Bosnia, which she said happened in a combat zone.\par \par \uc2 Trump also slammed Clinton and her husband for using their public sector influence to enrich themselves.\par \par \uc2 He said Clinton spent "her entire life" raising money for special interests and has "taken plenty of money out for herself."\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 This story has been corrected to note that Trump questioned Clinton's religion on Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton is escorted by House Minority Leader Rep.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 BOSTON (AP) \u8212\'20\'14 Two Boston brothers who claimed to be inspired in part by Donald Trump's views on immigrants were sentenced to state prison after admitting they beat a homeless Mexican man because they thought he was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , authorities said.\par \par \uc2 The Suffolk County District Attorney's Office said Scott Leader, 38, and Steven Leader, 30, pleaded guilty Monday to indictments charging them with causing bodily injury while committing a civil rights violation, assault and battery for purposes of intimidation causing bodily injury, two counts each of assault and battery and two counts each of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon.\par \par \uc2 Suffolk Superior Court Judge Peter Krupp sentenced Scott Leader to three years in prison and Steven Leader to 2 \u189\'00\'BD years behind bars, with both sentences followed by three years of probation. Krupp also ordered them to serve 20 hours of community service and complete a cultural diversity training program.\par \par \uc2 "This unprovoked attack on a sleeping man disgusted every prosecutor, victim advocate, and trooper who worked on it," said Suffolk County District Attorney Daniel F. Conley. "State prison was the only appropriate sentence."\par \par \uc2 The brothers admitted to urinating on the man as he slept outside of a Dorchester commuter transit stop in August 2015, then beating him with a pole, punching and kicking him.\par \par \uc2 Prior to sentencing, Assistant District Attorney Nicole Rimar read a statement from the victim.\par \par \uc2 "I still feel pain all over my body from this incident. I don't think my fingers will ever be the same," the victim, then 58, wrote. "I came to this country many years ago and worked hard in the farm fields to provide produce to people here. I actually became a permanent resident of this country years ago, although if I had been undocumented I still would not have deserved to be beaten this way."\par \par \uc2 The victim was treated for a broken nose, serious bruising across his torso and other injuries.\par \par \uc2 State police identified the suspects with the help of witnesses.\par \par \uc2 One of the brothers later told police that Trump "was right" about deporting "all these illegals," according to a police report.\par \par \uc2 The GOP front-runner has denounced the attack.\par \par \uc2 "Boston incident is terrible. We need energy and passion, but we must treat each other with respect," Trump tweeted. "I would never condone violence."\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020160516ec5g00b4b\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc20}{\*\bkmkend toc20}\b \uc2 Recent Kansas Editorials\b0\par\par\uc2 By The Associated Press   \par \uc2 1,969 \uc2 words\par \uc2 19 April 2016\par 06:15\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2016.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The Wichita \uc2 Eagle\uc2 , April 13\par \par \uc2 Advocates on both sides should come together on legislation that leaves no potential for abuse of municipal power at the expense of low-income homeowners.\par \par \uc2 Gov. Sam Brownback's veto of a bill targeting urban blight might seem an overly zealous defense of property rights. But it's a red flag when proponents insist a law won't be used as aggressively as its language clearly allows.\par \par \uc2 The governor's move should spur advocates on both sides to come together on legislation that leaves no potential for abuse of municipal power at the expense of low-income homeowners.\par \par \uc2 Wichita and other cities have huge problems with unoccupied, deteriorating properties, which currently are defined as "abandoned" when they've been unoccupied for 90 days and delinquent on property taxes for two years.\par \par \uc2 By expanding the definition of "abandoned" properties to include those that have been unoccupied for a year and have a "blighting influence on surrounding properties," Senate Bill 338 would make it easier for a municipal government to take over such sites and, with a district court's approval, transfer possession to nonprofit groups with plans to rehabilitate them.\par \par \uc2 Organizations such as \uc2 Habitat for Humanity\uc2 , Mennonite Housing and Power CDC already have helped clean up and transform not just lots or blocks but neighborhoods in Wichita. It's reasonable to want to enable their efforts, and do more about the 17,600 vacant properties in the city.\par \par \uc2 But it was telling that the bill's opposition in the Legislature, where it passed the House 79-44 and the Senate 32-8, spanned left and right politically.\par \par \uc2 Sen. David Haley, D-Kansas City, filed a formal protest arguing that the bill would "legalize grand theft" by "not-for-profit" developers in the name of "civic pride" or "community betterment."\par \par \uc2 Five other Democrats and four conservative Republicans in the House joined Rep. Gail Finney, D-Wichita, in the explanation of her "no" vote, which warned that the bill allowed "our local governments to expeditiously confiscate, seize or destroy law-abiding citizens' private property without compensation, adequate notice, and a legal property title."\par \par \uc2 Mayor Jeff Longwell and other Wichita City Council members expressed disappointment at Tuesday's meeting with the veto, complaining about how certain cases stretch for three or four years as homeowners manipulate the system and affect neighboring property rights. They have a point.\par \par \uc2 But so do opponents including Brownback, who said in his veto message Monday that he would "welcome legislation that empowers local communities to respond to blight and abandoned property that does not open the door to abuse of the fundamental rights of free people." That should be the shared goal.\par \par \uc2 ______\par \par \uc2 The Topeka Capital-Journal, April 16\par \par \uc2 Schwab case shows importance of having facts\par \par \uc2 The Raymond and Amelia Schwab episode should be a cautionary reminder for those who would take up a cause before all facts emerge.\par \par \uc2 Raymond Schwab planted himself in front of the Kansas Capitol on March 13 to demand the return of his children, five of whom were removed from his care by the Kansas Department for Children and Families. According to the Schwabs, their children were stolen by the state because Raymond had used medical marijuana to treat his post-traumatic stress disorder.\par \par \uc2 Before long, the Schwabs weren't the only ones protesting. By the end of March, demonstrators were spending 24 hours a day outside the Statehouse, holding up signs condemning a government that "destroys children and families." A civil rights attorney named Matthew Pappas decided to take the case at the behest of Cheryl Shuman, the president and chief executive officer of the Beverly Hills Cannabis Club.\par \par \uc2 Shuman, who was in Topeka with Pappas on March 30, said she was trying to put the Schwabs' case at the center of a much wider conversation: "I want to make sure everyone knows that what's happening here in Kansas can't happen to families anymore."\par \par \uc2 It all seemed so horrible \u8212\'20\'14 a disabled veteran and his wife had been robbed of their children and forced to plead their case on the steps of the Statehouse. How could the state be so callous?\par \par \uc2 Now that more information has surfaced, Shuman, Pappas and everyone else who supported the Schwabs' custody fight (such as former Kansas gubernatorial candidate Jennifer Winn) should be feeling a little queasy.\par \par \uc2 According to evidence cited by the Kansas Court of Appeals, the Schwabs are far from the embattled civil rights heroes they purport to be. A letter written by the Schwabs' 15-year-old son (whose name remains confidential because of his age) reveals a history of negligence, abuse and methamphetamine use.\par \par \uc2 The teenager claimed he sometimes had to take the "five children upstairs and had to protect them from both parents, they were scared." He also said his parents would sleep for days after taking methamphetamines and his father "threatened me saying he would kick me out of the house or hit me if I talk to anyone."\par \par \uc2 These are only a few of the harrowing details.\par \par \uc2 The DCF issued the following statement on March 15: "Although we are bound by confidentiality requirements and prohibited from discussing the specifics of the case, to protect the privacy of his children, we can say Mr. Schwab's accusations are false."\par \par \uc2 Had these words been taken more seriously, demonstrators could have waited for more information instead of flagrantly undermining their cause by associating with the Schwabs.\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 The Hutchinson News, April 17\par \par \uc2 Improving our voting system\par \par \uc2 Imagine, 80 percent voter participation by 2020.\par \par \uc2 Sounds like an audacious goal \u8212\'20\'14 a BHAG (big, hairy, audacious goal), as they say \u8212\'20\'14 but it's the goal, nonetheless, of a nonprofit called Democracy Works. It is a nonpartisan organization with a number of partners that seeks to raise Americans' engagement with our democracy, especially that of the Millenial generation.\par \par \uc2 It also is one antidote to state election officials and politicians who seek to make voting more difficult rather than less so.\par \par \uc2 That makes it good for Kansas, where Secretary of State Kris Kobach has pursued a voter-unfriendly agenda that makes life difficult for those voting for the first time or who have moved or who just want to vote and don't understand all the complexities involved today.\par \par \uc2 Millenials are among the most politically active of Americans, reportedly having much to do with the surprising surge in popularity of Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders. But they also are among the worst voters. Voters aged 18-29 came out strong in 2008, participating at a 58-percent rate the year \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  was elected president. But that sunk to 45 percent in 2012 and to just 17 percent in the 2014 midterms.\par \par \uc2 Democracy Works provides a website at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.turbovote.org"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 www.turbovote.org}}}\uc2  designed to make it easy for anyone anywhere in the U.S. to register to vote. Then it helps voters with absentee and mail ballots if they wish and provides alerts and reminders when elections are upcoming. In short, it cuts the clutter of the elections bureaucracy, even in places such as Kansas, where it isn't easy to vote.\par \par \uc2 No wonder millenials \u8212\'20\'14 or anyone else, for that matter \u8212\'20\'14 get disinterested. To get registered in Kansas, you better have proper proof of your citizenship, and you better know the deadlines and show up at the polls with proper ID. Primary elections \u8212\'20\'14 and a presidential caucus such as the one Kansas had last month \u8212\'20\'14 are even more complicated because the different political parties have different rules about party affiliation and registration deadlines.\par \par \uc2 While the voter ID law was sensible, it still had the effect of disenfranchising voters in Kansas. And the proof-of-citizenship law was even worse, because not everyone has a birth certificate or other approved document handy.\par \par \uc2 We need to make sure that only American citizens vote, but we created a system that suppressed voting of far more legal citizens than it stopped the rare \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who was casting a vote. Had it been done right, the burden would have been on the government to verify citizenship, not on the citizen who has a constitutional right to vote. The government manages to track and verify citizens for purposes of Social Security, so why not for voter registration?\par \par \uc2 If the government is technologically savvy enough to hack into the supposedly unhackable Apple iPhone belonging to the San Bernardino, Calif., mass shooter, surely it can figure this out.\par \par \uc2 Turns out, somebody can. The Electronic Registration Information Center (ERIC) is another nonprofit, this one governed by member states, to manage a central database to track registered voters who move within and among participating states. It essentially syncs voter rolls with states' other citizen databases, such as motor vehicle registration or driver's license records.\par \par \uc2 Fifteen states and the District of Columbia participate. Imagine Kansas is one? Of course not.\par \par \uc2 If Alabama can join such an endeavor, one using readily available technology to make voting easier, why can't Kansas?\par \par \uc2 Is not voting the foundation of our democracy? Is there any right we enjoy as American citizens that is more important? You would think this country could get voting right.\par \par \uc2 And for whatever reason, the U.S. ranks a dismal 138th in the world in voter turnout, according to TurboVote.\par \par \uc2 Looks like it will be up to nonprofits such as Democracy Works to create systems to work through the bureaucracy that people such as Kobach have created \u8212\'20\'14 bureaucracy that has disenfranchised voters, whether unintentionally or not.\par \par \uc2 We can have a system that verifies voter eligibility yet still makes it easy and simple to vote. But absent that in places such as Kansas, we have third-party tools such as TurboVote to step in where government won't or can't make voting easier.\par \par \uc2 ______\par \par \uc2 The Lawrence Journal-World, April 18\par \par \uc2 Adequate funding for community services will be the difference between success and failure for juvenile justice reform in Kansas.\par \par \uc2 The juvenile justice reform bill signed last week by Gov. Sam Brownback envisions a positive shift from detention to treatment for juvenile offenders in Kansas.\par \par \uc2 It's a sound philosophy, but it will only succeed if the state makes the necessary investment in the community services that will oversee young offenders in less restrictive settings.\par \par \uc2 The new law is aimed at reducing the number of low-risk juvenile offenders in out-of-home placements. Instead, more of those young people would be allowed to stay at home while participating in community-based educational, vocational and therapy programs.\par \par \uc2 Officials estimate that the number of youths sent to out-of-home facilities will drop by about 60 percent in the next five years, resulting in a savings to the state of about $72 million. The plan is to reinvest that money in community-based programs.\par \par \uc2 The new law may be well-intentioned, but it has not been universally praised. The Kansas County and District Attorney's Association, for instance, issued a statement on Monday saying the law will "undermine the discretion of the courts to hold offenders accountable and protect the public." It also noted that the state had not identified the necessary funding to support the law's "expansive agenda."\par \par \uc2 The funding issue for juvenile justice reform may remind some Kansans of promises that were made when the state began to close residential treatment facilities for people with mental illness. Moving those patients to less-restrictive community treatment facilities was, in principle, a positive move, but state funding for community mental health services has not kept up.\par \par \uc2 Hopefully, the community services for juvenile offenders won't face a similar circumstance. It would be unfortunate if the positive aspects of shifting more young offenders to community support programs are overshadowed by problems related to the underfunding of those community services.\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020160419ec4j002s4\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) \u8212\'20\'14 A lawyer for a man on death row for a double murder more than a decade ago told the state Supreme Court Thursday that his client should get a new trial based on blood evidence tested after his conviction and a claim that a relative of the victims confessed to the crimes.\par \par \uc2 Lindsey Boney, a lawyer for Clemente Aguirre-Jarquin, said his client is innocent and should be retried. Aguirre was convicted of murdering Cheryl Williams and her mother, Carol Bareis, in Seminole County in 2004.\par \par \uc2 The lawyer said 155 blood stain samples were taken from the women's trailer but was never tested before the trial. Once tested after the conviction, none matched Aguirre but some matched Williams' daughter, Samantha Williams.\par \par \uc2 "Her DNA is found in eight blood stains throughout the crime scene in key locations," Boney said.\par \par \uc2 He also said Samantha Williams has mental health issues and had been involuntarily committed to a hospital three years before the murder after threatening her mother. It was among 60 times she was involuntarily committed before and since the murders.\par \par \uc2 Boney said Samantha Williams told a friend in 2010 that she committed the murders and that there were demons in her head. He said in 2012, Williams also told her neighbors she killed her mother and grandmother. Justices questioned the context of the latter confession because it was made during an argument in which she was threatening the neighbors.\par \par \uc2 "That's a seriously mentally challenged individual who has a mother who has expressed that she was afraid of her and now we have confessions that she did it and her DNA," Justice Barbara Pariente said to Assistant Attorney General Jim Riecks, who argued that Aguirre's conviction should stand.\par \par \uc2 A telephone number for Williams was disconnected and she couldn't be reached for comment, but she denied killing her mother and grandmother during a previous court hearing.\par \par \uc2 Justice Peggy Quince noted Samantha Williams lived in the house and the blood could have been from a previous injury. Williams, then 21, spent the night of the murders at her boyfriend's, who discovered the bodies when he drove to the trailer to get clothes for her.\par \par \uc2 Riecks told the justices there was overwhelming evidence against Aguirre, including blood-stained clothes and bloody footprints that matched his shoes.\par \par \uc2 "He was saturated through his shorts, into his underwear and blood was found on his socks beneath where his shoes would have been covering them. He was thoroughly drenched in the victims' blood," Riecks said.\par \par \uc2 Aguirre's blood-soaked clothes were found in a bag in the trailer where he lived next door. The knife used to kill the women was found between the two homes and it matched a knife missing from a restaurant where Aguirre worked. He testified at his trial that he went into Williams' trailer to get some beer, found Williams' body and picked her up to try to revive her. Williams had been stabbed 127 times.\par \par \uc2 Aguirre said he picked up the knife in the trailer thinking the killer might still be inside. He said he didn't call police because he was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  and didn't want to be deported to his native Honduras.\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020160407ec47005oy\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

(AP) \u8212\'20\'14 Three years after it was filed, a lawsuit filed by a Papillion man who says he was unlawfully detained and wrongly treated as an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  has been dismissed.\par \par \uc2 U.S. District Judge Joseph Bataillon dismissed the lawsuit against the Sarpy County sheriff, jail staff and a federal immigration agent on Thursday, the \uc2 Omaha World-Herald\uc2  reported ( {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://bit.ly/1ThRmKB"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://bit.ly/1ThRmKB }}}\uc2  ). \uc2 The American Civil Liberties Union\uc2  of Nebraska had sued on behalf of Ramon Mendoza in 2013.\par \par \uc2 Bataillon said in his order that the lawsuit failed to establish that Mendoza's constitutional rights were violated.\par \par \uc2 Mendoza was jailed in March 2010 after he was pulled over by a sheriff's deputy for a minor traffic infraction. Mendoza is a naturalized U.S. citizen from Mexico, but was held in the Sarpy County jail for days on suspicion of being in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 The lawsuit says he gave deputies his name, address and Social Security number, and that law enforcement officials repeatedly turned away Mendoza's wife and son when they tried to present Mendoza's naturalization certificate, Social Security card and other documents to prove his citizenship.\par \par \uc2 The lawsuit also said jail staff repeatedly addressed Mendoza using racial slurs and that one official showed him a picture of a swastika.\par \par \uc2 Mendoza was released only after Sarpy County officials received a fax from federal immigration officials saying they had no reason to detain him \u8212\'20\'14 four days after Mendoza was jailed, according to the lawsuit.\par \par \uc2 "The county defendants' performance of their duties as intake and/or booking clerks could arguably be found wanting," Bataillon wrote in his order. "However, those actions have not been shown to be anything more than multiple innocent mistakes. The county defendants' actions do not show 'plain incompetence' or any knowing violation of the law."\par \par \uc2 The ACLU Nebraska office was closed Saturday, and a spokesman did not immediately return a message seeking comment.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 Information from: \uc2 Omaha World-Herald\uc2 , {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.omaha.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.omaha.com }}}\uc2 , \par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020160305ec350096s\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 HOUSTON (AP) \u8212\'20\'14 Brawling from the get-go, a fiery \uc2 Marco Rubio\uc2  went hard after \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  in Thursday night's Republican debate, lacerating the front-runner's position on immigration, his privileged background, his speaking style and more.\par \par \uc2 Ted Cruz piled on, too, questioning the front-runner's conservative credentials, as the two senators tag-teamed Trump in a debate that reflected the increasing urgency of their effort to take down the billionaire businessman before he becomes unstoppable. It was a rare night where the bombastic Trump found himself on the defensive.\par \par \uc2 The two-hours-plus debate played out as a raucous night of tit-for-tat insults, with candidates shouting over one another so much that it was hard to follow at times. The showdown came just days before the Super Tuesday 11-state round of mega-voting that could all but lock up the nomination.\par \par \uc2 When Trump faulted Rubio on a deal to buy a $179,000 house, the Florida senator shot back that if Trump "hadn't inherited $200 million, you know where \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  would be right now? Selling watches in Manhattan."\par \par \uc2 In another rough exchange, Rubio accused Trump of shifting his position on deportation, hiring people from other countries to take jobs from Americans and being fined for worker violations. Joining in, Cruz criticized Trump for suggesting he alone had "discovered the issue of illegal immigration."\par \par \uc2 Trump shot back at Rubio: "I hired tens of thousands of people. You've hired nobody."\par \par \uc2 As for Cruz, Trump took a more personal tack, touting his own ability to get along with others and adding: "You get along with nobody. ... You should be ashamed of yourself."\par \par \uc2 Both Rubio and Cruz said that Trump had had to pay a $1 million fine for illegal immigration hiring.\par \par \uc2 The candidates were pressed on why they haven't released their tax returns as promised. The GOP's 2012 nominee, Mitt Romney, suggested this week that Trump was holding back because there was a "bombshell" that would be revealed.\par \par \uc2 Trump said he's been audited by the \uc2 IRS\uc2  every year and can't release his returns while that's going on.\par \par \uc2 Rubio and Cruz both promised to release more of theirs in the next two days.\par \par \uc2 Rubio was the principal aggressor of the night, and he held nothing back. Taking on Trump's declaration that he'd build a wall on the Mexican border, Rubio declared: "If he builds a wall the way he built Trump Tower he'll be using \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  labor to do it."\par \par \uc2 Trump, for his part, insisted that even though officials in Mexico have said they won't pay for his planned wall, "Mexico will pay for the wall." And he said that because Mexico's current and former presidents had criticized him on the issue, "the wall just got 10 feet taller."\par \par \uc2 Trump, known for his frequent use of coarse and profane language on the campaign trail, scolded former Mexican President Vicente Fox for using a profanity in talking about Trump's plan for the wall.\par \par \uc2 "He should be ashamed of himself and he should apologize," declared Trump.\par \par \uc2 After Trump mocked Rubio for his "meltdown" in a previous debate when the Florida senator repeated rote talking points, Rubio swatted right back, scolding Trump for spouting the same five things over and over: "Everyone's dumb. He's going to make America great again. We're going to win, win, win. He's winning in the polls."\par \par \uc2 Trump was hardly silent, responding to both Rubio and Cruz: "This guy's a choke artist and this guy's a liar. ... Other than that I rest my case."\par \par \uc2 While Rubio was loaded for bear from the start, Cruz ramped up his criticism as the night wore on and argued that Trump wouldn't be an effective opponent against Hillary Clinton in the general election.\par \par \uc2 The finger-pointing extended to foreign affairs, with Cruz saying of Trump's plans to negotiate a solution to the Mideast conflict, "He thinks Palestinians are a real estate deal."\par \par \uc2 Making light of Cruz's repeated attempts to diminish him, Trump said: "Keep fighting, keep swinging, man, swing for the fences."\par \par \uc2 There was this back-and-forth after one particularly heated exchange:\par \par \uc2 Cruz to Trump: "Donald, relax."\par \par \uc2 Trump to Cruz: "I'm relaxed. You're the basket case."\par \par \uc2 The debate's location in Houston gave a nod to the primacy of Texas in the Super Tuesday voting: There are 595 delegates at stake, 155 in Texas.\par \par \uc2 The debate audience included former President George H.W. Bush, 91, and his wife, Barbara \u8212\'20\'14 who missed out on the chance to see their son Jeb take part. He dropped out of the race after a poor showing in the first states to vote.\par \par \uc2 The other two remaining candidates, Ben Carson and John Kasich, were largely left to watch the fireworks flying overhead.\par \par \uc2 At one point, as the top three candidates mixed it up, Carson spoke up: "Can somebody attack me please."\par \par \uc2 Later, he complained, "I didn't get asked about taxes, I didn't get asked about Israel." When all five were asked about North Korea's president, he said, "We should make sure that he knows that if he ever shoots a missile at us it'll be the last thing he does."\par \par \uc2 Kasich, for his part, said he would try to find a way to effect regime change in North Korean but "perhaps the Chinese can actually accomplish that."\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 Nancy Benac reported from Washington.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) \u8212\'20\'14 Republican \uc2 Sen. Lindsey Graham\uc2  , whose own quest for the GOP presidential nomination ended unsuccessfully, on Thursday called \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  a "nut job" who likely will win the party's nod, but lose in November's general election.\par \par \uc2 "He's just generally a loser as a person and a candidate," the South Carolina senator told reporters, adding, "You can't nominate a nut job and lose, and expect it doesn't have consequences."\par \par \uc2 Asked whether he'd endorse the billionaire businessman if nominated, Graham said, "I've got a ticket on the Titanic. So I am like on the team that bought a ticket on the Titanic after we saw the movie. This is what happens if you nominate Trump."\par \par \uc2 "I think he's going to lose, he's going to lose badly. And I think all the things that we care about are going to be locked in place, and she's going to get to pick Supreme Court nominees," he said of \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 , the Democratic front-runner.\par \par \uc2 He added that Clinton also would protect President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  's health care law, block the Keystone XL pipeline and ensure federal funds for \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2  .\par \par \uc2 Speaking again of Trump, Graham said: "He's ill-suited for the job. What Hispanic person would vote for the Republican Party when the leader of the party has just called illegal immigrants as a group mostly rapists and drug dealers, and is going to deport 11 million people including American-born children? Everybody in the Hispanic community knows at least one \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , like I do."\par \par \uc2 Trump and Graham have engaged in name-calling in the past, and last year, Trump gave out Graham's private cell phone number.\par \par \uc2 Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump gestures as he speaks at Regent University in Virginia Beach, Va., Wednesday, Feb. 24, 2016.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 HOUSTON (AP) \u8212\'20\'14 A Houston-area couple forced a Nigerian woman to care for their five children and home without pay during a two-year period in which she was physically and verbally abused, made to work nearly 20 hours a day and told to sleep on the floor, federal authorities say.\par \par \uc2 Chudy and Sandra Nsobundu were arrested Monday on charges of forced labor, withholding documents, conspiracy to harbor an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  and visa fraud. Authorities say the couple seized the nanny's passport, so she was unable to leave.\par \par \uc2 The 38-year-old nanny, whose full name is not given in the criminal complaint, told authorities she was promised $100 per month but has never been paid in her two years working for the Nsobundus in their home in the Houston suburb of Katy.\par \par \uc2 "She regularly endured physical and verbal abuse and was not treated like a human being," the criminal complaint said.\par \par \uc2 The Nsobundus made their initial court appearances Tuesday during separate court hearings. U.S. Magistrate Judge Nancy Johnson granted Sandra Nsobundu, 50, an unsecured bond and Chudy Nsobundu, 56, a $5,000 bond.\par \par \uc2 It wasn't immediately known if both would be released later Tuesday. Prosecutors had asked that Chudy Nsobundu be held without bond, arguing he was a flight risk.\par \par \uc2 Joan Nwuli, Sandra Nsobundu's attorney, declined to comment after her court hearing.\par \par \uc2 The judge asked Chudy Nsobundu to hire an attorney after he didn't qualify for a court-appointed lawyer. During his court hearing, Chudy Nsobundu said he runs a business that provides home health care services.\par \par \uc2 The Nsobundus each face up to 20 years in prison if convicted.\par \par \uc2 Ruben Perez, one of the federal prosecutors handling the case, said after Sandra Nsobundu's hearing that the nanny was "enslaved" by her employers. Perez said cases in which immigrants and others are forced to work in homes in harsh conditions as nannies or caretakers are more common than people think.\par \par \uc2 "We know they are out there. When it comes to our attention we'll act on them," he said.\par \par \uc2 The nanny, who was living in Lagos, Nigeria, started living with the Nsobundus in September 2013, according to the criminal complaint. The Nsobundus are naturalized U.S. citizens originally from Nigeria.\par \par \uc2 The complaint said the nanny would work every day from 5:30 a.m. to 1 a.m., couldn't take breaks and had to eat leftovers and not fresh food, including being forced to only drink milk left in bowls in which the children had eaten cereal. She also couldn't take hot showers, according to the complaint.\par \par \uc2 The nanny alleged Sandra Nsobundu repeatedly hit her if she thought the woman wasn't doing her job correctly. The complaint said Sandra Nsobundu is accused of once striking the nanny across the face with a slipper and threatening to "shoot her and kill her" after not liking the socks the woman had put on one of the younger children.\par \par \uc2 After the nanny found out that she hadn't been paid in two years, she reached out for help and was rescued last October following a tip to the National Human Trafficking Resource Center, the complaint said. It's not clear who made the tip.\par \par \uc2 Perez said the nanny is being cared for, but he declined to offer more details about her status.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 This story has been corrected to show the maximum punishment the Nsobundus each face if convicted is 20 years in prison, not 25 years.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 Follow Juan A.

Authorities say the couple seized the nanny's passport, so she was unable to leave.\par \par \uc2 The 38-year-old nanny, whose full name is not given in the criminal complaint, told authorities she was promised $100 per month but has never been paid in her two years working for the Nsobundus in their home in a Houston suburb.\par \par \uc2 "She regularly endured physical and verbal abuse and was not treated like a human being," the criminal complaint said.\par \par \uc2 The Nsobundus made their initial court appearances Tuesday during separate court hearings. U.S. Magistrate Judge Nancy Johnson granted Sandra Nsobundu, 50, an unsecured bond and Chudy Nsobundu, 56, a $5,000 bond.\par \par \uc2 It wasn't immediately known if they would be released later Tuesday. Prosecutors asked that Chudy Nsobundu be held without bond, arguing he was a flight risk.\par \par \uc2 Joan Nwuli, Sandra Nsobundu's attorney, declined to comment after her court hearing.\par \par \uc2 The judge asked Chudy Nsobundu to hire an attorney after he didn't qualify for a court-appointed lawyer. During his court hearing, Chudy Nsobundu said he runs a business that provides home health care services.\par \par \uc2 The Nsobundus each face up to 20 years in prison if convicted.\par \par \uc2 Ruben Perez, one of the federal prosecutors handling the case, said after Sandra Nsobundu's hearing that the nanny was "enslaved" by her employers. Perez said cases in which immigrants and others are forced to work in homes in harsh conditions as nannies or caretakers are more common than people think.\par \par \uc2 "We know they are out there. When it comes to our attention we'll act on them," he said.\par \par \uc2 The nanny, who was living in Lagos, Nigeria, moved to Texas to live with the Nsobundus in September 2013, according to the criminal complaint. The Nsobundus are naturalized U.S. citizens originally from Nigeria.\par \par \uc2 Perez said the nanny is being cared for, but he declined to offer more details about her status.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 Follow Juan A.

Her full name is not given in the criminal complaint.\par \par \uc2 Sandra Nsobundu, 50, made her initial appearance Tuesday in federal court in Houston. She was granted an unsecured bond and was set to be released. Her attorney, Joan Nwuli, declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 Chudy Nsobundu, 56, was set to appear in court Tuesday afternoon. Court records did not list an attorney for him.\par \par \uc2 The Nsobundus each face up to 25 years in prison if convicted.\par \par \uc2 The nanny, who was living in Lagos, Nigeria, moved to Texas to live with the Nsobundus in September 2013, according to the criminal complaint. The Nsobundus are naturalized U.S. citizens originally from Nigeria.\par \par \uc2 Ruben Perez, one of the federal prosecutors handling the case, said the nanny is being cared for, but he declined to offer more details about her status.\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020160209ec29005va\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Good morning! Here's a look at how AP's general news coverage is shaping up today in Texas. Questions about today's coverage plans are welcome, and should be directed to 972-991-2100. Diana Heidgerd is on the desk.\par \par \uc2 A reminder: This information is not for publication or broadcast, and these coverage plans are subject to change. Expected stories may not develop, or late-breaking and more newsworthy events may take precedence. Advisories, digests and digest advisories will keep you up to date.\par \par \uc2 Some TV and radio stations will receive shorter APNewsNow versions of the stories below, along with all updates.\par \par \uc2 UPCOMING TODAY:\par \par \uc2 FORCED LABOR-TEXAS\par \par \uc2 HOUSTON \u8212\'20\'14 A Houston-area couple has been accused of forcing a Nigerian woman to care for their five children and home without pay, seizing her passport and not letting her leave. Chudy and Sandra Nsobundu (SUB'-uhn-doh) of Katy faced an initial appearance Tuesday in federal court in Houston. The 56-year-old man and his 50-year-old wife were arrested Monday on charges of forced labor, withholding documents, conspiracy to harbor an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  and visa fraud. The charges say the 38-year-old Nigerian national was promised $100 per month. The live-in worker allegedly was not paid during two years with the family, faced physical and verbal abuse and was called "the idiot." She was rescued last October following a tip to an anti-human trafficking group. Online court records don't list attorneys to speak for the couple. SENT: 130 words. UPCOMING: Will be updated. Initial court appearance scheduled for after 10 a.m. CST.\par \par \uc2 BAYLOR-SEXUAL ASSAULT\par \par \uc2 WACO, Texas \u8212\'20\'14 A candlelight vigil to protest \uc2 Baylor University\uc2 's response to campus sexual violence drew scores of demonstrators to the street in front of the university president's home Monday night. About 100 people participated in the vigil in front of President \uc2 Kenneth Starr\uc2 's home. The group then marched to a brief prayer service outside Baylor's Truett Seminary. The protest comes after \uc2 ESPN\uc2  reported earlier this month that three students said the Southern Baptist-affiliated university in Waco failed to act on allegations that they were sexually assaulted by a former football player later convicted in one of those cases. SENT: 378 words, with photos. Also sent late Monday night.\par \par \uc2 EXONERATED MAN-DISBARMENT\par \par \uc2 AUSTIN, Texas \u8212\'20\'14 A former prosecutor who used false testimony and withheld evidence to send a now-exonerated man to Texas' death row has lost an appeal to overturn his disbarment. The Dallas Morning News ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://bit.ly/1TPB1fq"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://bit.ly/1TPB1fq}}}\uc2  ) reports that the Board of Disciplinary Appeals on Monday upheld the decision of the State Bar of Texas to disbar Charles Sebesta. The board's decision is final. The bar revoked the Burleson County district attorney's law license in June, finding he had engaged in prosecutorial misconduct in the case of Anthony Graves. Graves was sentenced to death in 1994 in the slayings of six people in South Texas two years earlier. A federal appeals court reversed his conviction in 2006. Graves spent 18 years in prison, including 12 on death row. He filed a complaint in January 2014. SENT: 130 words. UPCOMING: 250 words.\par \par \uc2 IN BRIEF:\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 VATICAN-MEXICO-BORDER \u8212\'20\'14 The Diocese of Las Cruces bishop says the diocese will be getting tickets to a Papal Mass in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico after all.\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 TRUCKING COMPANY-FRAUD \u8212\'20\'14 The former head of a South Texas trucking company must serve eight years in prison over a nearly $16 million loan scam.\par \par \uc2 SCHOOL BUS DRIVER-PORN \u8212\'20\'14 A Southeast Texas school bus driver who went by "Mr. Happy" on an adult website must serve nearly 42 years in prison in a child pornography case.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 If you have stories of regional or statewide interest, please email them to aptexas@ap.org.

But as a focus of a documentary film, he is more willing to share.\par \par \uc2 The introspection under studio lights in a basement classroom is typical of a little-known program bringing together honors students and low-income adult learners at the \uc2 University of Utah\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The class, called "Humanities in Focus," aims to link members of two communities who otherwise would be unlikely to overlap. It is based on the notion that privilege shouldn't determine who gets heard and who doesn't.\par \par \uc2 The roughly three dozen students in the class range in age from 20s to 50s. Some have origins as far flung as Nigeria; others are from Salt Lake City.\par \par \uc2 They have divided into film crews to chronicle slices of life in Utah, from living with autism to being homeless.\par \par \uc2 Now in its 10th year, the class meets Monday nights over baked potatoes or bowls of chili before reviewing footage and chatting story.\par \par \uc2 The yearlong course for underclassmen and Utahns below the poverty line remains popular, with a wait list for next year. It has changed some participants for the better \u8212\'20\'14 persuading the subject of a piece on domestic violence to seek treatment, for example. And the six university credits often are the start to a high school or college degree.\par \par \uc2 "It's about letting people find their voice," said Jean Cheney, associate director at the Utah Humanities Council. "It just gives them a camera to tell their stories and the tools to do it well."\par \par \uc2 It does not have the same institutional support as a typical university course.\par \par \uc2 While the U. provides some space and covers nominal costs, a patchwork of donations and grants pays the bulk of the $50,000 it takes to rent cameras, microphones and editing software \u8212\'20\'14 and help students with gas money or transit passes.\par \par \uc2 In the communication building on a Monday in November, the tools were at work as Bobby reviewed the past few years for the rolling camera.\par \par \uc2 He got a DUI. He caused enough trouble to get kicked out by his folks. He slept on friends' couches before landing at a shelter, where an infection almost caused him to lose his left arm. Without identification or an address, his prospects for a steady job, a nice place and a diploma are slim.\par \par \uc2 "I'm neither an American," he said, "nor a Mexican."\par \par \uc2 The lack of belonging is the main subject of the documentary, said honors student Stephanie Barajas, who hopes the film will show more Utahns what it's like to be young and living in the state unlawfully.\par \par \uc2 "It's just that piece of paper" that's missing, she said. "I was born here. That's something I'll never have to worry about."\par \par \uc2 Barajas was inspired to make the film in part by her boyfriend Diego Catalan, a U. student living in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 Catalan demurred with a smile when asked about the film. Lucia Chavarria, a co-instructor, piped up.\par \par \uc2 "Children of Mexico, they don't see themselves as survivors or having a sense of bravery," she said. Chavarria first read about the program in the newspaper in 2006. She hesitated to sign up, believing herself to be lacking in technical savvy.\par \par \uc2 "I'm afraid of computers," said Chavarria, originally of Chihuahua, Mexico. "I didn't know how to turn on a camera."\par \par \uc2 She was not the only novice.\par \par \uc2 English professor Jeff Metcalf crafted a new syllabus after he taught the U.'s Venture humanities course \u8212\'20\'14 an adaptation of the national Clemente program, which was honored by the White House in October for provoking deeper understanding of the human experience and creating better access to cultural resources. In Utah, 500 people have successfully taken the course, versions of which are also hosted by \uc2 Weber State University\uc2 , Westminster College and \uc2 Southern Utah University\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Metcalf, along with Chavarria and other Venture students, wanted to take the class a step further and create a forum for community activism.\par \par \uc2 They landed on film, but had no experience and no resources.\par \par \uc2 "They said, 'Where are you going to get the money?'" Metcalf said. He began calling up colleagues, enlisting Emmy-winning documentary professor Craig Wirth as a co-teacher.\par \par \uc2 The extra effort it took Chavarria to learn to operate the camera and software was worth it for a broader lesson, she said.\par \par \uc2 "I learned if somebody is willing to open up and share," she said, "dignify that and listen."\par \par \uc2 Chavarria is eager to see Barajas' movie and others at a screening in April.\par \par \uc2 "In the end, they all carry the same message," she said. "To me, it's all just hope."\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 Information from: The \uc2 Salt Lake Tribune\uc2 , {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.sltrib.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.sltrib.com}}}\par \par \uc2 In this Monday, Dec. 7, 2015 photo, David Skorut and Nick Cockrell work on their project in their Humanities in Focus class at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 SCRANTON, Pa. (AP) \u8212\'20\'14 Following a career in surgery that spanned four decades, Dr. Gino Mori decided to head back to medical school in 2013 to fill some gaps in his education.\par \par \uc2 After all, he completed his undergraduate education in science at \uc2 Penn State University\uc2  in 1953, the same year scientists James Watson and \uc2 Francis Crick\uc2  are credited with discovering the structure of DNA.\par \par \uc2 "You can imagine that basic science had changed quite a bit," he said with a smile.\par \par \uc2 The 83-year-old physician completed about 40,000 surgeries in his 37\u189\'00\'BD years in medicine, but after retiring with his younger brother, fellow doctor and partner on Jan. 1, 2001, his unquenchable lifelong thirst for knowledge pushed him back to school. He has amassed nearly 200 credits in subjects like art, philosophy and history at the University of Scranton, and his alma maters of \uc2 Keystone College\uc2  and Penn State.\par \par \uc2 After The Commonwealth Medical College opened in Scranton, Mori joined as a volunteer faculty member and then jumped in himself, embedding with the incoming students in the class of 2017.\par \par \uc2 Going back to school meant a return to the past for a man who has always craved education.\par \par \uc2 He was born in Old Forge in 1932 to a socialist coal-mining father from Italy whom he calls an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . In the same breath, he notes that no human being is illegal.\par \par \uc2 Like the rest of his neighborhood, Italian was the language of the Mori family, which included the boy's illiterate maternal grandparents, he said.\par \par \uc2 His father, Primo Mori, only ever completed a sixth-grade education, but taught himself English by devouring The \uc2 New York Times\uc2 , National Geographic and stacks of books, which filled the house. His intense curiosity of the world was passed on to his boy, who went on to study science at Penn State and medicine at \uc2 Thomas Jefferson University\uc2  in Philadelphia.\par \par \uc2 During medical school, he worked as a biochemist. At one point, he won a $600 grant to fund a study on a recently discovered chemical in the brain called serotonin.\par \par \uc2 "I thought it was going to be important," he said of the hugely influential neurotransmitter that relays messages in the brain and affects most of an individual's 40 million brain cells.\par \par \uc2 The man traded future research studies for a white doctor's coat, graduating from medical school in 1958. He moved back to Northeast Pennsylvania and opened his Scranton practice in 1963. Eventually joined by his brother, a urologist, and others, the organization morphed into the prominent medical practice of Delta Medix.\par \par \uc2 While building himself into a skilled surgeon and raising a family, Mori's nose still found its way back to books and learning. Toward the end of his career, he tinkered with laparoscopic surgery, in which tools and a camera are inserted into a body through small cuts rather than a more stressful, larger one. He even practiced on early models of the DaVinci Robot \u8212\'20\'14 a multi-armed device controlled by a surgeon at a console \u8212\'20\'14 to operate on chickens.\par \par \uc2 "I always kept up with the new innovation," he said.\par \par \uc2 Retiring from medicine gave him more time to engage in his devotion for education. But sitting in with a fresh group of medical students, where the public is not allowed to audit, confused many.\par \par \uc2 "When we first started classes, I was astounded that the med school would admit such an old individual," one of the students in the class, Paula Morzenti, now 33, said with a chuckle.\par \par \uc2 Another student, 27-year-old Nelson Femi Sofoluke, remembered seeing a "mysterious figure" during those first few whirlwind weeks of classes.\par \par \uc2 The classmates quickly learned about the surgeon in their midst, and said his great depth of knowledge of the body became an invaluable asset as they struggled through the first two years of medical school. In return, the students helped the old doc with his iPhone and MacBook laptop computer. He now expertly swipes through his smartphone screen like a teenager, and wishes the "Apple-Z" undo command on his computer could be applied to real life.\par \par \uc2 The technology has changed in medical school, and so has the demographics. Mori's class of 175 included only one student who was not a white male. That certainly wasn't the case in 2013.\par \par \uc2 The old doctor embraced that change as well. He was part of a study quartet that included a woman, Morzenti, and Sofoluke, who is black, that would talk medicine over lunch.\par \par \uc2 "He's always gravitated to people who come from different backgrounds," said Sofoluke, now a third-year medical student. "I think it all goes back to his affinity for learning."\par \par \uc2 He left a lasting impression on the aspiring doctors, who said they were inspired by his never-ending quest for knowledge and passion for helping people.\par \par \uc2 "I just hope one day I can grow up and be a person like him," said Morzenti, also a third-year student. "I will never forget that man."\par \par \uc2 After completing the first two years with the TCMC class of 2017, Mori took the fall semester off to raise money for the medical scholarship that bears his wife's and his name.

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc33}{\*\bkmkend toc33}\b \uc2 Kris Kobach, his views spark intense reactions\b0\par\par\uc2 By BRYAN LOWRY   \par \uc2 The Wichita Eagle\par \uc2 2,165 \uc2 words\par \uc2 29 September 2015\par 03:01\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2015.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WICHITA, Kan. (AP) \u8212\'20\'14 The four women, in their 70s or 80s, bubble with excitement. They're about to see the man they hope will be the next Kansas governor and maybe, one day, president.\par \par \uc2 Jacki Cahill, 81, clad in a red American flag T-shirt and a silver elephant necklace, came with her sister and two neighbors from her retirement village in Basehor to see Secretary of State Kris Kobach in Lansing.\par \par \uc2 "How many times have we heard him speak?" she says, turning to her sister. "At least 10 or 15. We went to Topeka once to see him when they was protesting outside. We was in Overland Park when that Sheriff Joe (Arpaio) was there and they had a bomb threat. We was in the second row. Kris said, 'I'm going to give a speech, that's what I came here for.' I looked at my sister and said, 'We're going to sit here and listen to it.' "\par \par \uc2 Cahill agrees with Kobach on immigration, saying "we've got do something about those illegals," and praises his push for voter ID and proof-of-citizenship laws. What the women like most, they say, is that Kobach keeps his promises.\par \par \uc2 Kobach enjoys intensely loyal support from conservative voters who flock to see him at grassroots events and tune in weekly to hear him on the radio. This August night in Lansing, he has drawn about 70 people, three times as many as the usual speaker, Republican organizers say.\par \par \uc2 But he demurs when people push him to say he will run for higher office, like governor, in 2018. He says he is focused on doing his job, which will include prosecuting alleged cases of voter fraud starting in October.\par \par \uc2 During the most recent elections, he was able to produce twice the number of volunteers to go door to door for the party as Gov. Sam Brownback or U.S. Sen. Pat Roberts could, said Clay Barker, the executive director of the Kansas Republican Party. "The intensity of his supporters is stronger," Barker said.\par \par \uc2 The same could be said about the intensity of his detractors, who warn that he's a dangerous extremist and accuse him of race-baiting.\par \par \uc2 Kobach has had "a devastating impact on voting rights in the state of Kansas and, for that matter, across the country," says Micah Kubic, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Kansas.\par \par \uc2 Kobach championed a proof-of-citizenship requirement to register to vote, a policy that has left thousands of prospective voters in suspended registration status since January 2013. Beginning this week, his office will remove any names that have been on the suspended list for more than 90 days.\par \par \uc2 He says this will save local election offices money, but the \uc2 ACLU\uc2  says it is primarily meant to relieve Kobach of the political embarrassment of having nearly 37,000 prospective voters in suspended registration status. He calls that ridiculous.\par \par \uc2 Charges of racism\par \par \uc2 Kobach speaks for nearly an hour to the crowd in Lansing. He uses no notes and encourages attendees to throw him questions. He darts from topic to topic.\par \par \uc2 He compares Planned Parenthood to the infamous Nazi doctor Josef Mengele and blasts President \uc2 Obama\uc2  for opposing congressional Republicans' efforts to defund it. "You couldn't even write a science fiction book about politics in America that would be this weird," he says.\par \par \uc2 Kobach encourages the ousting of moderate Republicans from the Kansas House, whom he accuses of being Democrats in disguise. He then brings up the Supreme Court ruling legalizing same-sex marriage and warns "it's going to get worse, not better, for those of us who believe in the traditional family."\par \par \uc2 Eventually a man stands up and asks Kobach when they will have the pleasure of voting for him for governor. A woman shouts, "No, president!"\par \par \uc2 Judy Wells, an attendee from Leavenworth, praises him as fearless. "He just goes on no matter how much he gets attacked," she says.\par \par \uc2 Danilo Balladares, executive director of Sunflower Community Action, a grassroots organization that advocates for the Latino and African-American communities in Wichita, said Kobach's policies keep minority voters away from the polls and that his rhetoric about voter fraud instills "fear in white conservative voters."\par \par \uc2 "It's minority voters, it's immigrant voters who are going to be scared to vote, who are likely not to have IDs, and it doesn't mean they're not citizens," Balladares says. "And you're also race-baiting another group."\par \par \uc2 Kobach has faced charges of racism since his failed congressional bid in 2004.\par \par \uc2 It's an accusation he calls ridiculous.\par \par \uc2 "It's just so sad that term's being used just to describe someone who's a conservative," Kobach says.\par \par \uc2 The man who asked Kobach to run for governor in Lansing was Latino: Jose Morales, a member of the Leavenworth school board. Morales, originally from Puerto Rico, a commonwealth whose residents are U.S. citizens, says he agrees with Kobach's proof-of-citizenship policy.\par \par \uc2 Kobach contends that the argument that minority voters can't provide proof of citizenship or show ID at the polls is itself racist. He says the political left uses charges of racism as a shortcut.\par \par \uc2 "If you call someone on the far left end of the Democratic Party spectrum a socialist, you're exaggerating their ideological position," Kobach says. "That's different from hurling a personal insult at someone and calling them a racist. That's personal. That's going after their motivations in their heart. I think one is a lot worse than the other."\par \par \uc2 Public image\par \par \uc2 Kobach says he eventually became numb to the attacks but that they bother his wife, Heather.\par \par \uc2 "When people criticize him, my first reaction is sickness . sick to my stomach," Heather Kobach says in a phone call. "I guess I try to remember that people who criticize him, they don't know him at all. They know a caricature of him."\par \par \uc2 She says her desire to shelter her children from this played a role in the couple's decision to home-school their five daughters.\par \par \uc2 "When they read something terrible that somebody said about their daddy, I'd like to be there to explain it to them," she says.\par \par \uc2 Despite his wife's discomfort with his public image, Kobach does not shy away from media attention.\par \par \uc2 Brownback and Attorney General Derek Schmidt typically communicate through e-mailed news releases. Kobach calls reporters on his cellphone. He says he enjoys sparring with the media, explaining that he was a "debate geek" in high school.\par \par \uc2 In his office, he has a framed \uc2 Newsweek\uc2  profile from 2011 that calls him "America's Deporter in Chief" and a courtroom sketch that \uc2 CNN\uc2  used when it was covering an immigration case that Kobach tried in federal court.\par \par \uc2 Kobach has also decorated his office with the mounted heads of two bucks he shot on his Douglas County farm and with photographs of his daughters, ages 4 months to 11, whom he takes hunting.\par \par \uc2 Sometimes the girls accompany Kobach to his radio show. If they can be silent for the whole two hours, they get to go turkey hunting with him as a reward.\par \par \uc2 Favorite topic\par \par \uc2 Kobach's weekly radio show on KCMO Talk Radio has given him a forum no other politician in the state has. He says the show makes him more accessible to citizens.\par \par \uc2 But it also has stirred controversy - including last year when he did not rebuke a caller who asked whether \uc2 Obama\uc2 's immigration policies could lead to ethnic cleansing of whites.\par \par \uc2 During a July episode, Kobach launched into one of his favorite topics: illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 "It is a fact that there is an illegal alien crime wave that has left thousands of Americans dead over the past decade or so. It's not an imaginary thing based on one or two cases," Kobach says. "There are many, many Americans who are no longer with us. They are dead because of illegal aliens who came to this country and committed horrible acts of murder."\par \par \uc2 Later, he contends that the number of Americans killed by illegal immigrants is "far more than the number of Americans killed" by the \uc2 Islamic State\uc2  and that thousands of lives would be saved by constructing a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border.\par \par \uc2 Janet Murguia\uc2 , president of the National Council of La Raza, the nation's largest Hispanic civil rights organization, says that rhetoric "puts a bull's-eye on the backs of all Hispanics, Latinos and immigrants and makes us vulnerable to the extreme nature of those words that inspire hate and hate crimes."\par \par \uc2 She cited a case in Boston in which a man arrested for attacking a Hispanic man cited presidential candidate \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  as his inspiration.\par \par \uc2 Murguia, who grew up in Kansas City, Kan., calls Kobach a forerunner of Trump and says his activism helped create "the current highly toxic atmosphere" on immigration that has helped propel Trump.\par \par \uc2 Kobach says his comments about illegal immigration are not aimed at any particular race and that it "is certainly not implied, nor is it factually correct, that when you say 'illegal aliens' you mean Latinos," since there are illegal immigrants from every racial group.\par \par \uc2 Senate Minority Leader Anthony Hensley, D-Topeka, who Kobach once called a "Maoist" on his radio show, sees a parallel between Kobach's activism on immigration and U.S. Sen. Joe McCarthy's crusade against suspected communist sympathizers in the 1950s.\par \par \uc2 "Joe McCarthy loved the headlines and spotlight as well when he went on his anti-communist tirade," Hensley says.\par \par \uc2 Bob Beatty, a political scientist at Washburn University, says that "what Kobach has been able to do - which in some ways is politically brilliant - is marry the voting issue with illegal immigration."\par \par \uc2 When Kobach talks about immigration, he uses "illegal alien" instead of "illegal or undocumented immigrant." His critics say that dehumanizes illegal immigrants, but he defended the term as legally accurate because federal law uses the phrase "an alien who is not lawfully present in the United States."\par \par \uc2 "I think the use of terms like 'undocumented immigrant' - it's really improper because it's legally incorrect," Kobach says.\par \par \uc2 Kobach has worked as an attorney for Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers suing the Obama administration and helped write Arizona's controversial law that allowed police to detain a person if there was a reasonable suspicion he or she was an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "If we could clone him, you know, we would prevail everywhere," says Mike Hethmon, an attorney for the Immigration Reform Law Institute who has worked with Kobach on numerous cases. Hethmon praised Kobach as a constitutional scholar and skilled debater in the courtroom.\par \par \uc2 Roots in 9/11\par \par \uc2 Kobach, who holds a law degree from Yale, traces his focus on illegal immigration back to his time at the \uc2 U.S. Justice Department\uc2  working under former U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft, whom he calls his most important mentor.\par \par \uc2 He started working for Ashcroft the week the Sept. 11 attacks took place in 2001. He was tasked with investigating loopholes in the immigration system.\par \par \uc2 "All of them came in legally, but then five of the 19 (hijackers) became illegal at some point during their stay. . They successfully abused our immigration system, and much of my time at the Justice Department was occupied in trying to plug the holes that they had exploited in our system," Kobach says.\par \par \uc2 He says that the impulse to restrict immigration dates to the founding fathers, referring to the controversial Alien and Sedition Acts passed during John Adams' presidency and notes that some immigrants were turned away at Ellis Island.\par \par \uc2 Beatty says "politics revolving around the fear of the other" has been a centuries-old strategy in U.S. politics. He compared Kobach's stance on illegal immigration to rhetoric used by nativists in the 19th century, when Irish immigrants came to the country in large numbers during the potato famine.\par \par \uc2 While Kobach's stand on the issue has made him a figure of scorn for opponents, it has endeared him to supporters who see him as "a man of action," Beatty says.\par \par \uc2 "It's very black and white when he talks to his supporters. ... He makes it really simple: Here's what we're going to do. We're the good guys," Beatty says.\par \par \uc2 Back in Lansing, the crowd applauds as Kobach ends his speech with a stinging attack on the Kansas Supreme Court. People line up to speak with him, and he spends the next half-hour listening attentively to each person's concerns as his aide takes notes.\par \par \uc2 Cahill marvels at his ability to speak with passion on an array of topics without any notes. After a pause, she touches her chest and says, "I think it's in his heart. I really do."\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 Information from: The Wichita (Kan.)

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 LAGUNA NIGUEL, Calif. (AP) \u8212\'20\'14 Sitting in a narrow strip of gray cubicles in a suburban California office, immigration agents and analysts quickly scroll through computer databases to try to determine which inmates sitting in jails across the country should be deported.\par \par \uc2 It looks more like a corporate office than a criminal crackdown, but the 85-person center is a key part of the federal government's efforts to identify and deport immigrants convicted of serious crimes.\par \par \uc2 After many police and sheriff's agencies refused to honor federal requests to hold immigrants in jail citing concerns about community relations and lawsuits, immigration agents had to work speedily to take them into custody. Now, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials are trying to be more flexible to regain support from local law enforcers, asking them to at least tell them when inmates facing deportation are being freed.\par \par \uc2 "There are criminals walking out of the jail, and we're trying to minimize that to the fullest extent possible," said Timothy S. Robbins, deputy assistant director of ICE's targeting operations division, which oversees the center in Laguna Niguel.\par \par \uc2 If doing so means specializing how the agency works with local law enforcement, "we're going to do that," he said.\par \par \uc2 Immigration enforcement has been under intense scrutiny since an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who had been deported five times was charged with the fatal shooting of a woman on a San Francisco pier this summer.\par \par \uc2 The man was jailed by the local sheriff's department but released under San Francisco's immigrant-friendly policies despite a request by ICE to keep him in custody until federal agents could pick him up.\par \par \uc2 Several hundred cities and counties have adopted policies in recent years limiting or prohibiting cooperation with immigration agents, citing concerns about eroding ties with immigrant communities and fear of lawsuits after a federal judge ruled that detaining inmates solely based on ICE requests was unconstitutional.\par \par \uc2 Since then, immigration authorities have also narrowed their focus to people convicted of more serious crimes, and the number of so-called detainer requests \u8212\'20\'14 which aim to have jails hold inmates up to 48 hours for deportation officers to pick them up \u8212\'20\'14 dropped by 24 percent in the 2014 fiscal year from a year earlier.\par \par \uc2 At the same time, the number of people deported from the United States, not counting those apprehended on the border, fell 24 percent, federal statistics show.\par \par \uc2 Immigration authorities had begun issuing detainers based on electronic data after getting access to fingerprints from jail bookings under enhanced law enforcement information-sharing after the 2001 terrorist attacks.\par \par \uc2 ICE initially started the hub in suburban Southern California to streamline the process for the region, one of the key spots where detainers were used. Now, the Pacific Enforcement Response Center issues about 40 percent of all immigration detainers and requests for notification when inmates are being released, handling the task for much of the country on nights and weekends.\par \par \uc2 The office, which issued 6,800 detainers and notification requests between June and August, contains half a dozen computers that collect leads for potential deportees and spit out the results on a large printer. Analysts and agents then search for matches in databases for visa holders, naturalized citizens and border arrests to determine the immigration status of those booked into local jails.\par \par \uc2 In the last three months, detainers or notification requests were sent in 11 percent of the center's cases. Others are typically sent to field agents for investigation and about half are set aside because the person is here legally or doesn't have a serious criminal conviction to make them a priority for deportation under the program, which was revamped last year, ICE officials said.\par \par \uc2 Under the new approach, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's department lets immigration agents interview inmates who have detainers but won't hold them beyond their release date. In Santa Clara County, officials still won't honor detainers but are weighing whether to notify ICE about serious offenders, while authorities in San Francisco won't do either despite public outcry after the shooting.\par \par \uc2 "They're kind of tailor making the program to fit every jurisdiction," said Los Angeles sheriff's commander Jody Sharp.\par \par \uc2 Muzaffar Chishti\uc2 , director of the Migration Policy Institute's New York office, said the country is creating a patchwork of immigration enforcement policies instead of the uniform system officials sought to create after 9/11.\par \par \uc2 "If we let local jurisdictions determine the nature of the immigration enforcement, all it means is local culture permeates everything else," he said.\par \par \uc2 Border enforcement advocates say too many convicted criminals are still going free, and immigrant supporters say the new approach continues to encourage racial profiling since police know when they arrest an immigrant, even on a minor charge, deportation officers can find them.\par \par \uc2 "It remains to be seen whether the constitutional defects have been repaired or merely rebooted in a different form," said \uc2 Chris Newman\uc2 , legal director for the National Day Laborer Organizing Network.\par \par \uc2 Immigration authorities say focusing on people with past criminal convictions helps combat profiling. And the government is preparing new paperwork for agencies that want to help identify more immigrants for deportation.\par \par \uc2 Jessica Vaughan\uc2 , director of policy studies for the \uc2 Center for Immigration Studies\uc2 , said cooperating with ICE should be the norm.\par \par \uc2 "No matter how much ICE is restricted and restrained, there are still places that will obstruct them," said Vaughan, whose group wants more immigration enforcement. "They will never be satisfied."\par \par \uc2 In this Aug. 31, 2015, photo, an unidentified Immigration and Customs Enforcement, ICE deportation officer reviews forms required to issue a detainer asking local law enforcement to hold someone until ICE agents can pick the person up, at the the Pacific Enforcement Response Center in Laguna Niguel, Calif.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 LAGUNA NIGUEL, California (AP) \u8212\'20\'14 Sitting in a narrow strip of gray cubicles in a suburban California office, immigration agents and analysts quickly scroll through computer databases to try to determine which inmates sitting in jails across the U.S. should be deported.\par \par \uc2 It looks more like a corporate office than a criminal crackdown, but the 85-person center is a key part of the federal government's efforts to identify and deport immigrants convicted of serious crimes.\par \par \uc2 After many police and sheriff's agencies refused to honor federal requests to hold immigrants in jail citing concerns about community relations and lawsuits, immigration agents had to work speedily to take them into custody. Now, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials are trying to be more flexible to regain support from local law enforcers, asking them to at least tell them when inmates facing deportation are being freed.\par \par \uc2 "There are criminals walking out of the jail, and we're trying to minimize that to the fullest extent possible," said Timothy S. Robbins, deputy assistant director of ICE's targeting operations division, which oversees the center in Laguna Niguel.\par \par \uc2 If doing so means specializing how the agency works with local law enforcement, "we're going to do that," he said.\par \par \uc2 Immigration enforcement has been under intense scrutiny since an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  who had been deported five times was charged with the fatal shooting of a woman on a San Francisco pier this summer.\par \par \uc2 The man was jailed by the local sheriff's department but released under San Francisco's immigrant-friendly policies despite a request by ICE to keep him in custody until federal agents could pick him up.\par \par \uc2 Several hundred cities and counties have adopted policies in recent years limiting or prohibiting cooperation with immigration agents, citing concerns about eroding ties with immigrant communities and the fear of lawsuits after a federal judge ruled that detaining inmates solely based on ICE requests was unconstitutional.\par \par \uc2 Since then, immigration authorities have also narrowed their focus to people convicted of more serious crimes, and the number of so-called detainer requests \u8212\'20\'14 which aim to have jails hold inmates up to 48 hours for deportation officers to pick them up \u8212\'20\'14 dropped by 24 percent in the 2014 fiscal year from a year earlier.\par \par \uc2 At the same time, the number of people deported from the United States, not counting those apprehended on the border, fell 24 percent, federal statistics show.\par \par \uc2 Immigration authorities had begun issuing detainers based on electronic data after getting access to fingerprints from jail bookings under enhanced law enforcement information-sharing after the 2001 terrorist attacks.\par \par \uc2 ICE initially started the hub in suburban Southern California to streamline the process for the region, one of the key spots where detainers were used. Now, the Pacific Enforcement Response Center issues about 40 percent of all immigration detainers and requests for notification when inmates are being released, handling the task for much of the country on nights and weekends.\par \par \uc2 The office, which issued 6,800 detainers and notification requests between June and August, contains half a dozen computers that collect leads for potential deportees and spit out the results on a large printer. Analysts and agents then search for matches in databases for visa holders, naturalized citizens and border arrests to determine the immigration status of those booked into local jails.\par \par \uc2 In the last three months, detainers or notification requests were sent in 11 percent of the center's cases. Others are typically sent to field agents for investigation and about half are set aside because the person is here legally or doesn't have a serious criminal conviction to make them a priority for deportation under the program, which was revamped last year, ICE officials said.\par \par \uc2 Under the new approach, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's department lets immigration agents interview inmates who have detainers but won't hold them beyond their release date. In Santa Clara County, officials still won't honor detainers but are weighing whether to notify ICE about serious offenders, while authorities in San Francisco won't do either despite public outcry after the pier shooting.\par \par \uc2 "They're kind of tailor making the program to fit every jurisdiction," said Los Angeles sheriff's commander Jody Sharp.\par \par \uc2 Muzaffar Chishti\uc2 , director of the Migration Policy Institute's New York office, said the country is creating a patchwork of immigration enforcement policies instead of the uniform system officials sought to create after 9/11.\par \par \uc2 "If we let local jurisdictions determine the nature of the immigration enforcement, all it means is local culture permeates everything else," he said.\par \par \uc2 Border enforcement advocates say too many convicted criminals are still going free, and immigrant supporters say the new approach continues to encourage racial profiling since police know when they arrest an immigrant, even on a minor charge, deportation officers can find them.\par \par \uc2 "It remains to be seen whether the constitutional defects have been repaired or merely rebooted in a different form," said \uc2 Chris Newman\uc2 , legal director for the National Day Laborer Organizing Network.\par \par \uc2 Immigration authorities say focusing on people with past criminal convictions helps combat profiling. And the government is preparing new paperwork for agencies that want to help identify more immigrants for deportation.\par \par \uc2 Jessica Vaughan\uc2 , director of policy studies for the \uc2 Center for Immigration Studies\uc2 , said cooperating with ICE should be the norm.\par \par \uc2 "No matter how much ICE is restricted and restrained, there are still places that will obstruct them," said Vaughan, whose group wants more immigration enforcement. "They will never be satisfied."\par \par \uc2 In this Aug. 31, 2015, photo, an unidentified Immigration and Customs Enforcement, ICE deportation officer reviews forms required to issue a detainer asking local law enforcement to hold someone until ICE agents can pick the person up, at the the Pacific Enforcement Response Center in Laguna Niguel, Calif.

He could face life in prison if convicted.\par \par \uc2 Lopez-Sanchez acknowledged shooting Steinle but said the gun he found under a bench had fired accidentally. Prosecutors disagreed.\par \par \uc2 "He could have fired the gun anywhere, but he fired at Kate Steinle," prosecutor Diane Garcia said in court. "He played his own version of Russian roulette."\par \par \uc2 Public defender Matt Gonzalez said his client never pulled the trigger. Instead, he says Lopez-Sanchez found the gun wrapped in a T-shirt and it accidentally went off as he picked up the bundle.\par \par \uc2 "This gun has no safety," Gonzalez said of the .40 caliber semiautomatic pistol that was reported stolen in June by a federal agent. Gonzalez said the gun is a common weapon used by law enforcement and police have reported other accidental discharges.\par \par \uc2 "There is no evidence that he put his finger in the trigger," the lawyer said.\par \par \uc2 Judge Brendan Conroy said he heard enough evidence over a five-day preliminary hearing to warrant a jury trial for Lopez-Sanchez, who has pleaded not guilty.\par \par \uc2 The shooting triggered a national debate over immigration after it was revealed that the Sheriff's Department had released Lopez-Sanchez despite a federal request to detain him for possible deportation.\par \par \uc2 Lopez-Sanchez was previously deported five times to his native Mexico.\par \par \uc2 Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump has repeatedly mentioned the killing of Steinle as he calls for a border wall and mass deportations to curb illegal immigration. California Sen. \uc2 Dianne Feinstein\uc2  and presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton, both Democrats, said Lopez-Sanchez should have been detained.\par \par \uc2 San Francisco Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi said he was following city law when jailers released Lopez-Sanchez after a 20-year-old marijuana possession charge was dropped.\par \par \uc2 The sheriff said his department requires federal officials to obtain a warrant or some other judicial notice in order for his jail to hold an inmate facing possible deportation.\par \par \uc2 Gonzalez said Lopez-Sanchez is homeless and has a second-grade education. He was released from jail in April with no money then arrested an hour after the shooting while wearing one sock and two pairs of pants to keep warm.\par \par \uc2 Lopez-Sanchez told police at one point that he was shooting at a seal or a black fish. But Gonzalez said it was an awkward effort by Lopez-Sanchez to explain the accidental shooting.\par \par \uc2 The parents of Steinle have said federal and local authorities contributed to the death through negligence and bureaucratic bungling.\par \par \uc2 The family alleges in legal claims that a \uc2 Bureau of Land Management\uc2  ranger left his loaded service weapon in a backpack in plain view in his car before the gun was stolen.\par \par \uc2 BLM spokeswoman Martha Maciel said the agency is cooperating with the investigation of the shooting but she declined further comment.\par \par \uc2 The Steinle family and their attorneys filed three separate legal claims seeking unspecified damages from the BLM, \uc2 San Francisco Sheriff's Department\uc2  and \uc2 U.S. Department of Homeland Security\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Such claims must be filed before government agencies can be sued.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 This story has been corrected to reflect that the charge against Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez is second-degree murder, not first-degree.\par \par \uc2 FILE - In this July 7, 2015 file photo, Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, right, is lead into the courtroom by San Francisco Public Defender Jeff Adachi, left, and Assistant District Attorney Diana Garciaor, center, for his arraignment at the Hall of Justice in San Francisco.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u8212\'20\'14 A judge declined Thursday to toss out the confession of a suspect charged with murder in a San Francisco shooting at the center of the national immigration debate.\par \par \uc2 Defense attorneys argued during a preliminary hearing that police didn't have good reason to arrest Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez an hour after the shooting of a young woman on a pier in San Francisco.\par \par \uc2 The attorneys argued that no one saw Lopez-Sanchez, who is in the country illegally, fire the gun on July 1 and that police arrested him because he was a homeless person acting suspiciously.\par \par \uc2 Several witnesses took photos of Lopez-Sanchez walking briskly away from 32-year-old victim Kate Steinle. Police used the photos to arrest Lopez-Sanchez, who then told investigators he accidentally shot Steinle.\par \par \uc2 Judge Brendan Conroy ruled Thursday that police acted appropriately in arresting and interrogating the suspect. The judge said he will rule Friday on whether the suspect must stand trial for murder.\par \par \uc2 The shooting triggered a national debate over immigration after it was revealed that the \uc2 San Francisco Sheriff's Department\uc2  had released Lopez-Sanchez despite a federal request to detain him for possible deportation.\par \par \uc2 Lopez-Sanchez, 45, was previously deported five times to his native Mexico.\par \par \uc2 Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump has repeatedly mentioned the killing of Steinle as he calls for a border wall and mass deportations to curb illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 California Sen. \uc2 Dianne Feinstein\uc2  and presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton, both Democrats, said Lopez-Sanchez should have been detained.\par \par \uc2 Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi said his department was following city law when jailers released Lopez-Sanchez after a 20-year-old marijuana possession charge was dropped.\par \par \uc2 The sheriff said his department requires federal officials to obtain a warrant or some other judicial notice in order for his jail to hold an inmate facing possible deportation.\par \par \uc2 San Francisco and some 300 other cities and counties have passed so-called sanctuary laws of non-cooperation with federal immigration officials seeking to detain jail inmates suspected of being in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors want to convict Lopez-Sanchez of second-degree murder, which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison.\par \par \uc2 His public defender Matt Gonzalez argues that the shooting was an accident and his client should be tried for manslaughter rather than murder. The maximum sentence for an involuntary manslaughter conviction is six years.\par \par \uc2 Lopez-Sanchez says he found the gun used in the shooting of Steinle under a bench on Pier 14. He said the gun accidentally fired when he picked it up.\par \par \uc2 Ballistic experts testified last week that the bullet ricocheted off the pavement before striking Steinle in the back.\par \par \uc2 The gun had been reported stolen from the car of a \uc2 Bureau of Land Management\uc2  ranger in June.\par \par \uc2 Steinle's family has filed three separate legal claims seeking unspecified damages from the BLM, \uc2 San Francisco Sheriff's Department\uc2  and the \uc2 U.S. Department of Homeland Security\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The three agencies declined to comment on the claims, which are precursors to lawsuits.\par \par \uc2 FILE - In this July 7, 2015 file photo, Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, right, is lead into the courtroom by San Francisco Public Defender Jeff Adachi, left, and Assistant District Attorney Diana Garciaor, center, for his arraignment at the Hall of Justice in San Francisco.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u8212\'20\'14 The parents of a San Francisco woman who was fatally shot by a man in the country illegally may have difficulty with their attempts to hold the city legally liable for their daughter's death, legal experts say.\par \par \uc2 The parents of Kathryn Steinle filed a wrongful death claim Tuesday alleging that the \uc2 San Francisco Sheriff's Department\uc2  is to blame for releasing an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  from jail despite a federal "detainer" request to keep in custody for possible deportation proceedings. A claim is usually a precursor to a lawsuit. Similar lawsuits blaming so-called "sanctuary city" policies have failed across the country, including a high-profile case in San Francisco.\par \par \uc2 A state appeals court in 2011 upheld a lower court ruling tossing out the wrongful death lawsuit a family filed against the city for failing to turn over to immigration officials a gang member in the country illegally before he gunned down a father and his two sons. The state appeals court said the policy was not intended to prevent violent crime.\par \par \uc2 Attorneys also said cities and counties are legally protected from most lawsuits involving police failures to prevent crime.\par \par \uc2 "It's difficult," said Matt Davis, an attorney who represented the Bologna family. "Cities aren't required to provide police protection."\par \par \uc2 The claim against San Francisco seeks unspecified damages.\par \par \uc2 The family and their attorneys also filed two other legal claims seeking unspecified damages from the BLM the \uc2 U.S. Department of Homeland Security\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The family said it would file lawsuits if the claims are denied.\par \par \uc2 Legal and gun experts said the family may fare better with their legal claim against the \uc2 Bureau of Land Management\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The family alleges that a \uc2 Bureau of Land Management\uc2  ranger left his loaded service weapon in a backpack in plain view in his car before the weapon was stolen in June.\par \par \uc2 The semi-automatic pistol was later used in the July 1 killing of 32-year-old Kathryn Steinle.\par \par \uc2 BLM spokeswoman Martha Maciel said the agency is cooperating with the investigation of the shooting but she declined further comment.\par \par \uc2 San Francisco officials have 60 days to decide on the claim. Federal authorities have a six-month deadline.\par \par \uc2 Legal and ballistic experts said the BLM agent appears to have stored the handgun improperly.\par \par \uc2 "At a minimum, it should have been stored and locked in the trunk, and usually this would be in some type of box or container that is affixed to the vehicle," said Ronald Scott, a Phoenix-based ballistics and weapons experts who teaches safety courses. "Leaving a backpack in a vehicle is like leaving a pocketbook in one. It is an invitation to steal."\par \par \uc2 The parents said they were filing the legal claims to prevent a similar tragedy. Claims are required to be filed with government agencies before they can be sued.\par \par \uc2 "We're here not only for Kate, we're here for every citizen of this country who comes to San Francisco," Jim Steinle, the father of the victim, said at a news conference at City Hall. "If you think this can't happen to you, think again."\par \par \uc2 Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, 45, has pleaded not guilty to a murder charge. He told police he fired the fatal shot accidentally while examining the ranger's gun after finding it under a bench on Pier 14.\par \par \uc2 The shooting triggered a national debate over immigration after it was revealed that the Sheriff's Department had released Lopez-Sanchez despite a federal request to detain him for possible deportation. Lopez-Sanchez was previously deported five times to his native Mexico. Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump has repeatedly mentioned Steinle's killing as he calls for a border wall and mass deportations to curb illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi said his department was following city law when it released Lopez-Sanchez in April after prosecutors dropped old marijuana possession charges against him.\par \par \uc2 San Francisco and other cities and counties across the state have enacted so-called "sanctuary city" policies of ignoring so-called detainer requests from Immigration and Customs Enforcement to hold inmates thought to be in the country illegally for deportation proceedings.\par \par \uc2 The Steinle family claimed the sheriff violated federal laws when he issued a memo in March barring jail staff from communicating with federal immigration officials about detainer requests.\par \par \uc2 Mirkarimi has said his department requires federal officials to obtain a warrant or some other judicial notice in order for his jail to hold an inmate facing possible deportation.\par \par \uc2 Sheriff's spokeswoman Kenya Briggs said Mirkarimi can't comment on potential litigation but continues to extend his sympathy to the Steinle family for their loss.\par \par \uc2 The family also accused ICE, an agency within Homeland Security, of failing to obtain a warrant or judicial notice required by San Francisco to detain and deport Lopez-Sanchez.\par \par \uc2 "The Director of \uc2 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2  (ICE) met recently with members of the Steinle family to express the agency's profound sympathy for their loss," spokeswoman Virginia Kice said.\par \par \uc2 Brad Steinle, left, and Jim Steinle, right, the brother and father of Kathryn Steinle, answer questions during a news conference on the steps of City Hall Tuesday, Sept. 1, 2015, in San Francisco.

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc43}{\*\bkmkend toc43}\b \uc2 Motives behind 'sanctuary cities' vary; some fear lawsuits\b0\par\par\uc2 By AMY TAXIN   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 979 \uc2 words\par \uc2 24 July 2015\par 13:22\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2015.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif. (AP) \u8212\'20\'14 The term "sanctuary city" has become a rallying cry for conservative Republicans seeking stiffer immigration laws. They characterize such places as havens where those in the country illegally are protected from immigration authorities.\par \par \uc2 The reality behind the phrase is that while some cities actively thumb their noses at federal immigration policies, many refuse to enforce them not because of any moral obligation to immigrants; they fear lawsuits.\par \par \uc2 Since the fatal shooting of Kathryn Steinle on a San Francisco pier allegedly by an immigrant who was released from jail even though \uc2 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2  sought to deport him for a sixth time, the debate over how to handle cities and counties that refuse to cooperate with immigration authorities has reached a feverish pitch.\par \par \uc2 On Thursday, House Republicans passed a bill aimed at punishing cities that refuse to share information with federal immigration authorities, which the White House threatened to veto. While the bill doesn't specifically address the release of immigrants sought by federal authorities for deportation, the Republicans are pitching other legislation to do so.\par \par \uc2 The vote came after presidential hopeful \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  attacked illegal immigration on the campaign trail.\par \par \uc2 While notably liberal San Francisco has openly declared itself a haven for all immigrants regardless of their legal status, some of the cities and counties that have stopped detaining immigrants for ICE are politically conservative and are not trying to shield residents from deportation.\par \par \uc2 The city of Huntington Beach, California, which is predominantly white and Republican, stopped honoring the hold requests last summer for purely legal reasons. A federal court ruling in Oregon said so-called immigration detainers, which ask local police to hold immigrants suspected of living in the U.S. illegally for up to 48 hours, were not sufficient reason to keep someone in jail.\par \par \uc2 "We don't have any policy or anything that prohibits our folks from interacting with ICE. We just follow the law," said Police Chief Robert Handy, adding his officers don't generally ask about immigration status because it doesn't relate to their cases, not because they're protecting anyone. "If they go get a warrant, we'll hold them in our jail. If they ask us to go help for a search warrant on a drug house, we're going to help them."\par \par \uc2 San Francisco declared itself a sanctuary city more than two decades ago and continues to advertise itself as a place of refuge for immigrants. In 1989, the city passed an ordinance banning officials from enforcing immigration laws or asking about immigration status, unless required by law or court order. In 2009, it began issuing municipal identification cards that can be used to obtain a public library card and sign up for parks programs.\par \par \uc2 Today, San Francisco is one of more than 200 jurisdictions that have stopped fully honoring detainers.\par \par \uc2 The localities span a broad spectrum on how far they go to welcome immigrants or whether they're trying to assist them at all. A big distinction is the reasoning behind local detainer policies. Places like Cook County, Illinois, and Santa Clara County, California, are trying to cultivate trust of police in immigrant communities. Others, such as San Bernardino and Riverside counties in California, cite fear of getting sued.\par \par \uc2 "When you use the term sanctuary city, it implies a policy decision that's been made about how the city should engage with the immigrant community, and most of the detainer policies were adopted to address the legal concerns," said Jennie Pasquarella, a staff attorney with \uc2 the American Civil Liberties Union\uc2  of Southern California.\par \par \uc2 Mark Krikorian\uc2 , executive director of the anti-illegal immigration Center for Immigration Cities, acknowledged the difference but said the net effect was similar whether a city wanted to work with ICE or not.\par \par \uc2 "Some may cooperate here but not there. Some may cooperate on certain matters but not other matters. But any jurisdiction that does not cooperate fully with federal immigration authorities seems to me qualifies as a sanctuary city," he said.\par \par \uc2 Last year, a spate of localities that had long worked closely with ICE stopped honoring detainers in response to the ruling in Oregon. In response, immigration authorities said they would start asking police to simply notify them when a suspected \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  is about to get released \u8212\'20\'14 not necessarily detain them. They believe the new approach, combined with a focus on more serious offenders, will lead to better collaboration from local law enforcement.\par \par \uc2 In populous Southern California, immigration agents have tended to work more closely with sheriff's departments that run the county jails, where most serious offenders wind up. Smaller city jails like the one in Huntington Beach usually serve as short-term holding centers for misdemeanor arrests.\par \par \uc2 In the Orange County jail, deputies regularly interview immigrants about their legal status as part of a close collaboration with federal immigration agents. They tell them when someone they've flagged for possible deportation is due to be released. But the agency doesn't hold people on the detainers due to legal concerns, said Steve Kea, assistant sheriff of custody operations.\par \par \uc2 "We are not a 'sanctuary' jurisdiction by any existing definition," said Orange County undersheriff John Scott.\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writer Janie Har contributed to this report from San Francisco.\par \par \uc2 FILE - In this July 21, 2015, file photo, Liz Sullivan, mother of Kathryn Steinle, who was killed on a San Francisco Pier, allegedly by a man previously deported several times, listens to testimony behind Jim Steinle during a Senate Judiciary hearing to examine the Administration's immigration enforcement policies, in Washington. Since the fatal shooting of Steinle, the debate over how to handle cities and counties that refuse to cooperate with immigration authorities has reached a feverish pitch.

(AP) \u8212\'20\'14 To some Merced County farmers, a bill that would allow farmworkers who live in the country illegally to get work permits could be a solution to labor shortages.\par \par \uc2 Merced-area farmers said the proposal makes sense for their businesses because it would help widen the pool of field workers, the Merced Sun Star reports Saturday ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://bit.ly/1fTZ90t"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://bit.ly/1fTZ90t}}}\uc2 ).\par \par \uc2 The bill being considered by California legislators would establish a program for field workers who already live in the state without authorization instead of granting a temporary work visa to foreign laborers as existing programs do. Under the bill, the workers, their spouses and children who are in school could remain in the state without the threat of deportation.\par \par \uc2 Farmer Marc Marchini of J. Marchini Farms in Le Grand said that, depending on the season, it can be very difficult to find good labor.\par \par \uc2 Picking crops, he said, is not a glorified job, and many U.S.-born citizens are not willing to work in the fields. It is extremely difficult work and requires time to develop the skill, he said.\par \par \uc2 "We have to pull from the labor pools of those willing to work," he said.\par \par \uc2 Atwater farmer Bob Weimer said the bill would make it easier for California to keep track of the number of farmworkers available and needed, even if many immigrants living here illegally already work in the fields.\par \par \uc2 In Merced, about 43 percent of the county's \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  population works in agriculture, according to data released earlier this year by the University of Southern California's Center for the Study of Immigrant Integration.\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020150718eb7i00417\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 NEW YORK (AP) \u8212\'20\'14 One of the challenges for makers of the \uc2 MTV\uc2  documentary "White People" was getting folks to talk about race when they didn't feel the issue concerned them \u8212\'20\'14 like those quoted as saying they consider white the "default race" or "normal."\par \par \uc2 So filmmaker Jose Antonio Vargas recorded white Americans in situations where they were forced to confront racial identity issues. He found to a white man who attends a traditionally black college, teachers on a South Dakota reservation where resentment toward whites is palpable, a young Brooklyn man bewildered by the Asian immigrants on his block, a white man who teaches a college course on white privilege.\par \par \uc2 The documentary's trailer alone created a stir. The full film debuts Wednesday at 8 p.m. ET/PT, offered simultaneously online.\par \par \uc2 "The only thing I fear is not having these conversations," Vargas said. "What I fear is the silence, the indifference, the ignorance. We can no longer have a conversation about race and diversity without having white people in it."\par \par \uc2 Racial issues are timely, topping the news during the past several months with the "black lives matter" campaign in response to police shootings and the debate over the Confederate flag. MTV President \uc2 Stephen Friedman\uc2  said he's wanted to look at how whites perceive themselves for several years, but it wasn't until he met Vargas that he felt he'd found the right person to do it.\par \par \uc2 Vargas is best known for "Documented," a film where the Philippines-born journalist talks about his status as an undocumented U.S. resident. (His status hasn't changed since then).\par \par \uc2 Race was a difficult topic, not simply because it's uncomfortable to talk about. Shuns, slights and stereotypes aren't a regular part of life for most whites. More than four-fifths of \uc2 MTV\uc2  viewers polled said their families had taught them that everyone should be treated the same, regardless of differences.\par \par \uc2 A colorblind upbringing is admirable, an attitude that no doubt leads to young people being more accepting of gay marriage, for example, than older Americans, Friedman said. But many also look past the lessons of history to question the need for affirmative action. Vargas talks to a white student with a 3.8 grade point average in high school who now goes to a community college; she and her mother are convinced that racial minorities get the edge in college scholarships and admissions. "I feel like I'm being discriminated against," she said.\par \par \uc2 Attitudes hidden beneath the surface are revealed when Vargas talks to the white student who goes to a black college and some of his friends. A white Italian-American from Brooklyn's Bensonhurst neighborhood is angered by many of the Asians who moved into his neighborhood not wanting to help with a block party until it was pointed out that how his ancestors were looked down upon generations earlier.\par \par \uc2 Vargas is a facilitator who poses questions throughout the film. His eyebrow is a character of its own, each exaggerated lift conveying skepticism or surprise.\par \par \uc2 "Part of our job with this special is to really create the space to have an honest dialogue," he said, "and I think we achieved that."\par \par \uc2 Some critics have pounced on \uc2 MTV\uc2  before seeing the documentary. Rush Limbaugh's website proclaims, "\uc2 MTV\uc2  Documentary Shames White Youth." The conservative Breitbart news service headlined a story, "Dear Morons: You are Paying for an Illegal Alien's MTV White-Shaming Film." The "paying for" reference alludes to cable subscribers being required to pay for \uc2 MTV\uc2  as part of their service even if they don't necessarily want the network.\par \par \uc2 "So this is a documentary produced by an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  that's going to run starting July 22nd on \uc2 MTV\uc2  on the problems white people have caused in America," Limbaugh said on his show last week. "Everybody's shaking their head in there, 'Oh, this is horrible, this is terrible.' Yeah, it is, but nobody is going to do anything about it."\par \par \uc2 Friedman said he believed the film doesn't shame white people. Quite the opposite, he said.\par \par \uc2 "If you see the young people in that film, I think every one of them, because it was done in a respectful way, feels like they came away with a deeper understanding of their community and different people," he said. "It enabled them to walk in their shoes."\par \par \uc2 Given the attention on racial issues now, it's not surprising that the idea of the film itself will grate on some nerves, he said.\par \par \uc2 "What I would hope is that people would watch the documentary, because there is nothing about it that is provocative when you sit through it," he said.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 Follow David Bauder at twitter.com/dbauder.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Omaha World-Herald. June 1, 2015.\par \par \uc2 Care for mind as well as body\par \par \uc2 It's common sense to acknowledge that the mind and body are linked in a number of ways.\par \par \uc2 It's encouraging, then, to see how a growing number of Nebraska medical providers are working with behavioral health specialists to make sure that patients receive needed care for their mental health needs as well as their bodily ills.\par \par \uc2 Scot Adams, then the behavioral health director for the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services, summed things up well in a 2013 interview with The World-Herald.\par \par \uc2 "Twenty-five percent of all general hospital beds are filled by a person who is being treated for the effects of a behavioral health disorder but not for the disorder itself," he said. "A person is getting his wrist stitched up, but he's not being treated for his depression. A person is being treated for cirrhosis of the liver, but not for his alcoholism."\par \par \uc2 A 2013 article in the Journal of the \uc2 American Board of Family Medicine\uc2  explained the importance of integrating medical and behavioral health care. "Having two separate systems to take care of patients' medical and behavioral health needs can result in high costs, low satisfaction and poor outcomes, including premature mortality," the article stated.\par \par \uc2 Recent reporting by The World-Herald's Bob Glissmann explained that this "integrated care" approach is being used by health care providers including CHI Health, Nebraska Medicine and OneWorld Community Health Centers.\par \par \uc2 Integrated care is the hallmark of Health 360, a health care clinic in Lincoln operated by Lutheran Family Services of Nebraska.\par \par \uc2 Community Alliance, specializing in mental health services and substance abuse treatment, has received a federal grant so that primary care services are provided at its Leavenworth Street location.\par \par \uc2 As Glissmann's article explained, various challenges complicate the moves toward integrated care, including difficulties in reimbursement and a disconnect between behavioral health records and medical records.\par \par \uc2 Nonetheless, the soundness of the integrated care approach is indisputable. Mind and body are indeed linked. So should the professional care people receive to promote their wellness.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 Lincoln Journal Star. June 1, 2015.\par \par \uc2 Keeping children in family settings\par \par \uc2 The recent report that Nebraska places foster children outside of family settings at a higher rate than the national average should be put in context of recent history in the state.\par \par \uc2 The issue is a serious one. The challenge should not be ignored.\par \par \uc2 Yet it's somewhat of a relief that the numbers are not worse. The system was in chaos a few years ago when Gov. Dave Heineman's plan to privatize the child welfare system was falling apart.\par \par \uc2 Now Nebraska seems to be headed in the right direction.\par \par \uc2 In 2013, about 16 percent of foster children in Nebraska were placed outside their families, compared to the national average of 14 percent, according to the Kids Count policy report "Every Kid Needs a Family: Giving Children in the Child Welfare System the Best Chance for Success" from the \uc2 Annie E. Casey Foundation\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 A closer look at the figures shows that 21 states rank higher than Nebraska in the rate of out-of-home placement. Topping the list is Colorado, where 35 percent of foster kids are in non-family settings, according to the report.\par \par \uc2 A chronic problem that pre-dated even the botched privatization attempt was the over-eagerness of authorities in Nebraska to remove children from their homes at a rate higher than almost every other state in the country.\par \par \uc2 Judging from raw numbers in Nebraska, the state also must have improved on that measure, although the state-by-state rankings apparently have not been calculated for several years.\par \par \uc2 Between 2012 and 2014, the number of children in Nebraska removed from their homes decreased from 10.1 to 8 children per 1,000, the foundation said, and the most recent data from May 2015 shows that the removal rate has now dropped to 6.3 per 1,000 children.\par \par \uc2 The number of children under the age of 18 in out-of-home care during this period also decreased from 4,789 to 3,754.\par \par \uc2 Noting that the statistics in the Kids Count report were from 2013, Reno said that Nebraska has continued to improve the rate at which children are placed in family settings. In January 2013, for example, 661 children in the child welfare system were in group homes or emergency shelters. In May only 229 children were in that type of care. In 2013, 25.8 percent of children were in relative or kinship homes. Now, 44.5 percent are in the homes of relatives.\par \par \uc2 Suggestions in the Every Kid Needs a Family report point the way to continued improvement, especially the recommendation that communities provide a wide range of services so authorities have more options to allow children to remain safely in families.\par \par \uc2 Now that the child welfare system in Nebraska is back from the brink of disaster, it's imperative that improvement continue. Finding more options for keeping and placing children in a family setting will save money. More importantly, it's best for the children.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 McCook Gazette. June 1, 2015.\par \par \uc2 Most minimum-wage workers can't afford a one-bedroom apartment\par \par \uc2 Nebraska's minimum wage is going to $9, far below the $15 some activists are demanding, so it was interesting to see a study published by the \uc2 National Low-Income Housing Coalition\uc2  about the cost of living.\par \par \uc2 According to the study, the average Nebraskan would have to work 54 hours at a minimum wage to afford a one-bedroom apartment.\par \par \uc2 Of course, that average includes Lincoln and Omaha, where rents are higher, and sets the amount the average minimum-wage worker would spend on housing at 30 percent of income \u8212\'20\'14 probably far less than most minimum-wage workers spend when they get out of their parents' homes.\par \par \uc2 On the other hand, minimum-wage jobs that allow workers to put in 54 hours are few and far between because of the benefits and overtime pay required.\par \par \uc2 Nebraska minimum-wage workers have it great compared to New Yorkers, who would have to put in 98 hours, the District of Columbia, Maryland and New Jersey, around 100 hours or more, or California, 92 hours \u8212\'20\'14 or even worse, Hawaii, where one would have to work 125 hours for a one-bedroom apartment.\par \par \uc2 As we predicted, higher minimum wages push employers to install more automation, such as a fast-food restaurant that lets customers order through kiosks instead of through a counter attendant.\par \par \uc2 But is the answer to housing affordability higher minimum wages, or are lower housing costs and lower standards of living required?\par \par \uc2 Minimum wage workers probably will never be able to afford to buy one, but according to the \uc2 U.S. Census Bureau\uc2 , in 2014, the average new single-family home sold for $345,800, costing $97.09 for each of its 2,506 square feet.\par \par \uc2 More and more people are finding ways to lower their cost of living.\par \par \uc2 Many are finding ways to reduce their cost of living, such as the "tiny house" proponents living in 400 square feet or less, or adopting European "net zero" standards calling for 500 square feet per person, although initial energy-saving costs are far from economical.\par \par \uc2 Of course, many resort to other methods \u8212\'20\'14 finding a roommate, moving back in with parents or other relatives \u8212\'20\'14 and does everyone need a $100 cell phone plan and a big-screen TV?\par \par \uc2 Yes, it's hard to live on minimum wage, but it was never designed to provide that level of income, and raising it can only result in more kiosks and robots on the job.\par \par \uc2 A better solution is upgrading personal skills, or even starting one's own business to bring in that living wage.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 The Grand Island Independent. May 31, 2015.\par \par \uc2 Senators show independent streak this year\par \par \uc2 My, oh my. Welcome to public office, \uc2 Pete Ricketts\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Nebraska's new governor has just completed his first legislative session, and to say it was rough might be putting it mildly.\par \par \uc2 The new gov went 0 for 3 with his big issue vetoes. Death penalty repeal: override. Gas tax increase: override. Dreamers' driver's licenses: override.\par \par \uc2 It has been a rough couple of weeks for Nebraska's first new governor in 10 years.\par \par \uc2 On most of these issues, though, what the senators did had little to do with the governor. It's not to say he was irrelevant; it's more that senators were dealing with issues that had built up for years to where the majority was ready to take action.\par \par \uc2 Although the unicameral Legislature is officially nonpartisan, still 35 of the 49 state senators are registered Republicans.\par \par \uc2 Why, after all these years, was the clear majority willing to buck a Republican governor?\par \par \uc2 The answer may lie more in the issues themselves, rather than in any party line position. There was no clear conservative/liberal line for most senators.\par \par \uc2 Take the issue of granting driver's licenses to "Dreamers," young immigrants who were brought to the U.S. illegally by their parents, but who were granted special legal status through an executive order by President Obama.\par \par \uc2 Forty-nine other states had already granted these licenses. Nebraska was the lone holdout. A number of Chamber of Commerce groups, farm groups and Omaha's Republican mayor came out in favor of the licenses.\par \par \uc2 Ricketts, however, held tight to the old anti-\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  line espoused by former Gov. Dave Heineman. The tide, though, had clearly turned on the issue.\par \par \uc2 Or consider the modest 6-cent gas tax increase to be phased in over four years. Many throughout the state and country have decried the deteriorating condition of roads and bridges. While no one likes a tax increase, a majority of senators felt the state had to act to protect its infrastructure.\par \par \uc2 And there's the death penalty. If there was ever a matter of conscience, this is it. Many conservatives have come to see the futility of it and how it conflicted with their right-to-life position on abortion.\par \par \uc2 Then there are the senators themselves. There are 17 new senators this year (14 Republicans and three Democrats). These senators have approached issues with an open mind. They haven't been jaded by years of lobbying and campaigns.\par \par \uc2 On the other side, there are a significant number of senators who will be facing term limits again next year. Term limits may have had a "freeing" effect on senators. Not having to worry about their next campaign, they are free to vote their conscience.\par \par \uc2 And in these days of social media, senators are setting themselves up for criticism no matter how they vote. So why not vote their conscience?\par \par \uc2 To be fair, part of Ricketts' agenda was achieved. The Legislature held the growth of state spending to the governor's target. While not approving his property tax reduction plan, they did add $64 million a year to the property tax credit program, achieving part of the governor's goal. Medicaid expansion wasn't approved.\par \par \uc2 While maybe disagreeing with their senator on certain issues, most Nebraskans likely admire the independent streak that senators have shown. Nebraskans are an independent lot who like doing what is right. That's what the senators believed they were doing.\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020150608eb68003rg\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.  \par \par \uc2 Smuggler's mistake turned rescue into tragedy\par \par \uc2 CATANIA, Sicily (AP) \u8212\'20\'14 Rescue seemed so close at hand. A ship with experience plucking migrants from unseaworthy smuggler's boats had arrived soon after the distress call went out. But then the fishing trawler's navigator made a maneuver that would seal the fate of the 850 people crammed inside: Instead of easing up alongside the merchant ship, he rammed it.\par \par \uc2 Officer who shot Washington farmworker dragged him from fire\par \par \uc2 SEATTLE (AP) \u8212\'20\'14 One of the officers who killed an immigrant farmworker in Washington state in a shooting that helped fuel the nationwide debate over police use of force had dragged the man away from his burning rental home just weeks earlier. Documents obtained by The Associated Press under public records requests reveal that Antonio Zambrano-Montes was sitting on the ground in January in a meth-addled trance near the fire when Officer Adam Wright found him.\par \par \uc2 Justice Dept. opens Baltimore police probe; 1K protest\par \par \uc2 BALTIMORE (AP) \u8212\'20\'14 The Justice Department said Tuesday it has opened a civil rights investigation into the death of Freddie Gray, a black man who suffered a fatal spinal-cord injury under mysterious circumstances after he was handcuffed and put in the back of a police van. After the probe was announced, at least 1,000 people gathered at a previously planned rally at the site of Gray's arrest. Protesters marched to a police station a couple of blocks away, chanting and holding signs that read "Black Lives Matter" and "No Justice, No Peace" \u8212\'20\'14 slogans that have come to embody what demonstrators believe is widespread mistreatment of blacks by police.\par \par \uc2 Yemen Shiite rebels call for rally as Saudi airstrikes end\par \par \uc2 SANAA, Yemen (AP) \u8212\'20\'14 Yemen's Shiite rebels have called for a massive rally in the capital, Sanaa, to mark the end of the month-long Saudi-led airstrikes campaign. The rebel-held Al-Masirah TV network urged supporters to take to the streets Wednesday, a day after Saudi Arabia announced an end to its coalition's campaign.\par \par \uc2 Afghan deportees from Iran return to a home they barely know\par \par \uc2 ISLAM QALA, Afghanistan (AP) \u8212\'20\'14 Tajigul Haidary had overstayed her residents' visa in Iran and was expecting just a hefty fine when she went to renew it, she said. Instead, she was arrested as an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , imprisoned, held in a transit center with hundreds of other Afghans and, early this week, deported at a dusty border point back to Afghanistan. It's a homeland that she hardly knows. Her family took her to Iran when she was nine years old. Now 26 years old, she is married to another Afghan in Iran, has a 4-year-old son and an 8-year-old daughter and is five months pregnant. When she was deported, she was wrested away from them.\par \par \uc2 Sunni tribesmen fight their own after breaking with IS group\par \par \uc2 MAKHMOUR, Iraq (AP) \u8212\'20\'14 When \uc2 Islamic State\uc2  militants swept across northern Iraq last summer, the Sunni al-Lehib tribe welcomed them as revolutionaries fighting the Shiite-led government in Baghdad. But less than a year later, the tribe is bitterly split between those who joined the extremist group and those resisting its brutal rule. The tribe hails from a village just south of Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, which was captured by the IS last year. Like many Sunnis in northern Iraq, they initially welcomed the \uc2 Islamic State\uc2  group as liberators.\par \par \uc2 Anger at acquittal of Chicago policeman in shooting of woman\par \par \uc2 CHICAGO (AP) \u8212\'20\'14 A judge's surprise acquittal of an off-duty Chicago police officer in the shooting death of an unarmed woman called into question prosecutors' decision not to charge the man with murder, and set off protests for a second day Tuesday. That the officer shot Rekia Boyd, 22, was never in dispute. But the judge said he was bound to find detective Dante Servin not guilty of involuntary manslaughter \u8212\'20\'14 because manslaughter requires evidence of "recklessness," while the judge described the act of shooting as "intentional."\par \par \uc2 Jurors see defiant Tsarnaev in photo as feds argue for death\par \par \uc2 BOSTON (AP) \u8212\'20\'14 As jurors looked at a photograph of Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev giving the finger to a security camera in his jail cell, a federal prosecutor described it as a defiant act by an unrepentant man who didn't care that he had killed four people, including an 8-year-old boy and a police officer. Assistant U.S. Attorney Nadine Pellegrini began laying out the government's case for executing Tsarnaev, and showed the jury large, vibrant pictures of the people killed in the bombing and its aftermath. Then she revealed the photo of Tsarnaev, taken three months later in his holding cell at the federal courthouse.\par \par \uc2 Pope accepts resignation of bishop who didn't report abuse\par \par \uc2 KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) \u8212\'20\'14 Pope Francis accepted the resignation Tuesday of a U.S. bishop who was convicted of failing to report a suspected child abuser, answering calls by victims to take action against bishops who cover up for pedophile priests. Bishop Robert Finn, who led the Diocese of Kansas City-St. Joseph in Missouri for nearly 10 years, resigned under canon law that allows bishops to resign early for illness or some "grave" reason that makes them unfit for office. But his resignation did not provide a specific reason.\par \par \uc2 With bird flu spreading, \uc2 USDA\uc2  starts on potential vaccine\par \par \uc2 MINNEAPOLIS (AP) \u8212\'20\'14 As losses to poultry producers continue to climb from a deadly strain of bird flu, the \uc2 U.S. Department of Agriculture\uc2  is working on a potential vaccine in response to the current outbreak. A pure "seed strain" would target the H5N2 virus \u8212\'20\'14 which has already cost Midwest turkey and chicken producers more than 6.7 million birds since early March \u8212\'20\'14 as well as some other highly pathogenic viruses in the H5 family that have been detected in other parts of North America. The \uc2 USDA\uc2  would then provide that seed strain to drug manufacturers if the agency ultimately decides the vaccine is necessary to stop avian influenza.\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020150422eb4m0036g\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ISLAM QALA, Afghanistan (AP) \u8212\'20\'14 Tajigul Haidary had overstayed her residents' visa in Iran and was expecting just a hefty fine when she went to renew it, she said. Instead, she was arrested as an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , imprisoned, held in a transit center with hundreds of other Afghans and, early this week, deported at a dusty border point back to Afghanistan.\par \par \uc2 It's a homeland that she hardly knows. Her family took her to Iran when she was nine years old. Now 26 years old, she is married to another Afghan in Iran, has a 4-year-old son and an 8-year-old daughter and is five months pregnant. When she was deported, she was wrested away from them.\par \par \uc2 "My husband tried his best to get me out but they wouldn't listen to him. My children cried, but it made no difference. I don't know what to do. I have to get back," she said, tugging at the voluminous black chador warn by many Iranian women, as she sat on a plastic chair in a shed at the Islam Qala border crossing.\par \par \uc2 Around 25,000 Afghans a month are deported from Iran at Islam Qala \u8212\'20\'14 nicknamed "Zero Point" \u8212\'20\'14 along with another 30,000 a month who cross returning home voluntarily \u8212\'20\'14 a sign of Tehran's efforts to control the huge numbers of Afghans who flock to their neighbor. Iran has long been an outlet for Afghans, either searching for work to escape poverty or seeking refuge from their country's chronic wars and instability.\par \par \uc2 Many Afghans are concerned that Iran is looking to shut off that outlet by clamping down even more on illegal migrants.\par \par \uc2 During a visit by Afghan President Ashraf Ghani to Tehran on Sunday, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani told him that the issue of Afghans in Iran "must be settled." Rouhani said Afghans living in Iran would be registered "so that the government can make appropriate decisions about them."\par \par \uc2 "Individuals who want to carry out business activities or study need to do so under legal requirements of obtaining visas," Rouhani told journalists after the talks.\par \par \uc2 Millions fled from Afghanistan to its neighbors Iran and Pakistan during the 1979-1989 Soviet occupation of Afghanistan or after the Taliban came to power in 1996 \u8212\'20\'14 creating one of the world's largest and longest refugee situations. Both Iran and Pakistan have been pressing for them to leave, and in the past 12 years, the \uc2 U.N\uc2 . refugee agency \uc2 UNHCR\uc2  has helped repatriate some 5.8 million Afghans who voluntarily agreed to return home.\par \par \uc2 But the number of willing returnees is dwindling. At the same time, Afghans slip constantly into Iran looking for work in their better-off neighbor. Throughout Iran, Afghans fill menial jobs like construction and some have lived in the country for years. As a result, there are not only around 950,000 registered Afghan refugees in Iran with legal status but 1 million to 1.4 million undocumented Afghans, according to estimates by the \uc2 International Organization for Migration\uc2 . In Pakistan, there are some 1.6 million registered Afghan refugees and an estimated 1.5 million undocumented ones.\par \par \uc2 Iran appears to be taking whatever chance it can to deport Afghans without documented status or unregistered as refugees with the \uc2 UNHCR\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 IOM\uc2 's communications director in Afghanistan, Matthew Graydon, said up to 10 percent of the returnees from Iran are vulnerable minors, girls and boys between 13 and 17 years old who could fall prey to traffickers, as well as mentally and physically disabled people, women traveling alone or single mothers. But neither \uc2 IOM\uc2  nor the Afghan authorities can offer help to all those who need it.\par \par \uc2 He said there has to be a concerted effort from humanitarian agencies and the Afghan, Iranian and Pakistani governments to find a long-term solution to their situation "so people won't get caught in the cycle of deportation, exploitation and issues such as that."\par \par \uc2 Traffic at Zero Point, 115 kilometers (71.5 miles) west of the provincial capital of Herat, is mostly one way \u8212\'20\'14 people coming out of Iran, willingly or not, along with trucks loaded with concrete, steel and fuel being imported. The trucks mostly return to Iran empty since Afghanistan, one of the world's poorest countries, offers little to export besides its desperate people.\par \par \uc2 "At 2 o'clock every afternoon, about 30 buses arrive carrying about 500 returnees. We do a random sampling, checking that they are who they say they are, and record their biometric details," Maj. Abdul Rafah Watander, head of the Afghan border police at Islam Qala, told The Associated Press. Among those being deported are sometimes Afghans who had legitimate visas in Iran but were arrested and expelled for no apparent reason, he said.\par \par \uc2 The border guards try to sift out criminals or people with special needs who need care among the crowds, but with limited staff they can only check about 100 people a day, while the others just go through, Watander said.\par \par \uc2 The actual border at Zero Point is marked by two shacks on each side along the strip of asphalt \u8212\'20\'14 Iranian guards in desert-camo fatigues, Afghans in green fatigues. The border stations on each side show the vast difference between the two. On the Afghan side are rickety shacks with broken windows and containers converted to offices on the Afghan side. On the Iranian side, wide roads, cellphone towers, mounted CCTV cameras, and a long snaking line of trucks.\par \par \uc2 As 2 p.m. approaches, buses, cars and vans start to cross. Once on the Afghan side, hundreds disembark and trudge to be screened, categorized and, if they need it, helped. Boys with wheelbarrows tout for business carrying luggage. One recent afternoon, two vans arrived with wooden coffins strapped to the roofs, repatriating dead Afghans for burial.\par \par \uc2 The vast majority of the arrivals are young men caught in Iran after paying traffickers to sneak them in for work.\par \par \uc2 One, a 16-year-old named Nurullah, said he was among 26 young men from his village in Faryab province, north of Herat, who paid $200 each to traffickers to take them to Iran's capital, Tehran. The traffickers took them along a long route across the southern part of the border, and they made it as far as the Iranian city of Isfahan, 340 kilometers (210 miles) south of Tehran. There, police caught them.\par \par \uc2 Nurullah, who like many Afghans goes by one name, said there's hardly any young men left in his village since they all leave to find work elsewhere. His older brother worked for two years in Iran and earned decent money before coming home.\par \par \uc2 Some young men try repeatedly to get work in Iran. But Nurullah said he won't be slipping back across the border. "It was just too stressful. I'll stay at home from now on and find whatever work I can. And maybe a wife."\par \par \uc2 ____\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writer Ali Akbar Dareini contributed to this story from Tehran\par \par \uc2 Follow Lynne O'Donnell on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://twitter.com/lynnekodonnell"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://twitter.com/lynnekodonnell}}}\par \par \uc2 In this Monday, April 13, 2015 photo, Afghan deportee, Tajigul Haidary, 26, right, presses her temples during an interview with The Associated Press, at the Afghanistan-Iranian border point, on the outskirts of Islam Qala in Herat province, west of Kabul, Afghanistan.

It has virtually more of everything, including enough nuclear weapons to leave the Earth a smoldering, radioactive rubble \u8212\'20\'14 only Russia vying with that capability.\par \par \uc2 Because this was in the "maiden speech" of the freshly minted senator, the temptation is to dismiss this as the ravings of an exuberant defense hawk feeling his oats. But this is a guy who got 46 other senators \u8212\'20\'14 46! \u8212\'20\'14 to sign an open letter to Iran in an attempt to scuttle negotiations to keep nuclear weapons out of Iran's hands. The apparently gullible John Cornyn and Ted Cruz were among those signing the letter.\par \par \uc2 Our fear is, first, that Cotton really is that persuasive or, second, that he speaks for a potent enough segment of his party to scare others into compliance because this segment has designated him its latest chosen one.\par \par \uc2 But maybe Cotton really has in mind the likes of ISIS, the caliphate wannabe, or other terrorist organizations. Implacable, dangerous foes to be sure \u8212\'20\'14 but, again, existing even though the U.S. is already militarily dominant. This dominance was in place, by the way, when terrorists struck on 9/11.\par \par \uc2 And a militarily dominant United States still found itself mired, first in Iraq and then Afghanistan \u8212\'20\'14 leaving enough of a mess in Iraq to give both ISIS and Iran openings and threatening to do much the same in Afghanistan because Afghans can't be thoroughly convinced to quit killing Afghans.\par \par \uc2 Cotton called for "such hegemonic strength that no sane adversary would ever imagine challenging the United States." The dictionary definition of hegemony is "leadership or dominance, especially by one country or social group over others."\par \par \uc2 Cotton seems to have a different definition of a key phrase there \u8212\'20\'14 leadership. This comes in leading by example and helping to solve problems before they explode into armed conflict. And this involves expertly directed foreign aid and diplomacy \u8212\'20\'14 of the kind, by the way, the United States and other countries are trying to exercise in nuclear negotiations with Iran.\par \par \uc2 The backdrop to Cotton's call to arms is the U.S. budget. Defense hawks, Cotton among them, want more spending than even the already generous deficit hawks \u8212\'20\'14 the Pentagon being a favorite agency \u8212\'20\'14 are going to give. Both segments savor how defense dollars trickle down to their communities.\par \par \uc2 But we would turn the traditional GOP argument on government spending around \u8212\'20\'14 on both segments. Shouldn't we eliminate waste and inefficieny first? For instance, the Pentagon, which should know, has said it has too many bases. Congress has refused to start another round of base closings \u8212\'20\'14 parochial concerns about "my base" or "my plant" clearly trumping all else.\par \par \uc2 Military City, USA benefits greatly from defense spending. We love our bases and would love to keep them but have confidence that they can stand on their merits. You see, even folks in a Military City, USA can recognize that, when it comes to defense spending, more is not necessarily the same as smart. We get the bigger picture.\par \par \uc2 Neither global dominance nor hegemony should be this nation's priority when it comes to defense spending. The world is far more complex than that. Influence and respect need not come from the end of a gun.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 The Dallas Morning News. March 23, 2015.\par \par \uc2 Legislature must fix Texas death penalty\par \par \uc2 Texans who support capital punishment might want to believe that the system has evolved into an excruciatingly fair, airtight application of society's utmost punishment.\par \par \uc2 If only that were the case, this newspaper might not stand with opponents of state-sponsored killing.\par \par \uc2 Each year brings a new set of execution dates that expose weaknesses in the system and offend the sense of justice. We trust that state lawmakers are alert to them and are willing to apply fixes.\par \par \uc2 Take Texas law on executing the intellectually disabled. Actually, there really isn't a law, despite the Supreme Court's 2002 landmark imperative against executing people with low IQs. The Texas response relies in part on a Court of Criminal Appeals ruling suggesting that someone like the fictional, dull-witted character Lennie in Steinbeck's novel Of Mice and Men is the type who ought to be spared the executioner's needle. Allusions to American literature have no place in deciding life-and-death matters in Texas.\par \par \uc2 The Legislature has neglected its duty to put greater specificity in the law, despite a steady flow of condemned inmates whose mental abilities have been in question.\par \par \uc2 Sen. Rodney Ellis, D-Houston, has legislation (SB 226) to remedy this. It would have the courts treat questions of intelligence like sanity questions, impaneling a jury to decide the matter before trial. Today, the same jurors who decide guilt-innocence also decide whether a person they just convicted is bright enough to be killed. The Ellis bill would separate the matters and take emotion out of the mix. This bill should pass and fill an embarrassing void in Texas law.\par \par \uc2 It was also embarrassing for the state when lawyers for mentally ill killer Scott Panetti discovered in the Houston Chronicle on Oct. 30 that his execution date had been set two weeks prior and was just weeks away. That's right: There was no direct, official notification to counsel that the state obtained a death warrant \u8212\'20\'14 and the clock was ticking toward an appeals deadline.\par \par \uc2 The remedy for this shamefulness would be companion bills by Rep. Senfronia Thompson, D-Houston, (HB 2110) and Sen. Juan "Chuy" Hinojosa, D-McAllen, (SB 1071). Texans should not tolerate stealth death warrants.\par \par \uc2 Nor should Texans tolerate the idea of an execution before all relevant evidence has been tested for DNA evidence that might bear on the case. Yet that's not a guarantee today, because of a screwy court decision requiring a defendant to prove "a reasonable likelihood" of biological material that could be tested. How might a defendant produce that proof if not through testing? Hence, a remedy by Ellis (SB 487) to eliminate this Catch-22 in state law.\par \par \uc2 This list of fixes could go on, but we'll mention just one more: the right of Texans to know everything about the execution process. That means everything \u8212\'20\'14 right down to the drugs used, their supplier and expiration dates. A bipartisan bill (HB 1587) by Reps. Terry Canales, D-Edinburg, and Tony Tinderholt, R-Arlington, would secure the public's right to know.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 The Facts of Clute-Freeport-Lake Jackson.

Whether that money has been well-spent is arguable at best.\par \par \uc2 As the Legislature continues to push through border security bills, the potential effectiveness of the proposals is something too often missing from the discussion. It should be at its center.\par \par \uc2 We have made the point before that state leaders stepping up to enhance a security presence they deem inadequate is perfectly reasonable. The money spent on extra state troopers, an added checkpoint and other provisions is still significantly less than that spent on education and health programs for the children of illegal residents.\par \par \uc2 That said, the state's measures are mostly an enforcement action that doesn't address the root causes of why many new illegal immigrants try to make it here \u8212\'20\'14 violence back home, largely from cartels seeking to meet the demand for illegal drugs in the United States.\par \par \uc2 We support the reasonable steps addressed in the House bill authored by Rep. Dennis Bonnen, R-Angleton, and hope it is the base toward which \uc2 the Senate\uc2  moves. That said, none of the $500 million to $800 million the state will budget goes toward what would do the most good, namely providing resources for Central American nations to fight the cartels and changes in our own country to address drug demand.\par \par \uc2 Until those things are addressed at the federal level, no amount of money Texas spends will make much of a dent in the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  problem.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 Houston Chronicle. March 18, 2015.\par \par \uc2 Saving tomorrow: Lawmakers should heed sound advice and prop up the Texas Tomorrow college fund.\par \par \uc2 Even as Texas parents prepare for a new child, many worry about how they will pay for the rising cost of college tuition. In response to this need, the Texas Legislature in 1997 opened the Texas Tomorrow Fund in order to let parents begin pre-paying college tuition. The state planned to use the interest earned from its pre-payment plan to cover the future cost of tuition.\par \par \uc2 The fund seemed to be a good idea at the time. It helped Texas parents plan ahead. It helped keep Texas talent in our state. It helped our state develop a better educated workforce. Since the fund was set up as a constitutionally protected trust and was backed by the state's full faith and credit, parents could sleep at night without worrying about whether the state would default on its commitment to them. In essence, parents had paid for an insurance policy against rising tuition costs.\par \par \uc2 About 158,000 families took advantage of the fund before the Legislature halted the program in 2003 when it decided to allow state universities to set their own annual tuitions. It failed, however, to make the necessary appropriations to keep the pre-existing fund in actuarial balance.\par \par \uc2 Despite this lack of oversight, parents who used the fund to prepay college tuition should still sleep soundly; the fund is guaranteed by a constitutional commitment. Comptroller Glenn Hegar, however, isn't as calm. He has sounded an alarm to taxpayers. The original fund is on track to run out of money by 2019, according to Hegar, even though the new fund, called the Texas Tuition Promise Fund, is structured to be actuarially sound.\par \par \uc2 Hegar has asked lawmakers to pump $600 million into the original fund this calendar year, ("State's tuition fund may run out," Page A1, March 10). That would bring the fund into actuarial balance. If lawmakers don't heed Hegar's advice, plugging the anticipated future deficit will be far more costly. By 2019, unfunded liability is estimated to balloon to more than $742 million.\par \par \uc2 Legislators should heed Hegar's warning.\par \par \uc2 The state has made a clear and unbreakable commitment to these families. The fund's promises must be kept. The state also has an obligation to be good stewards of taxpayers' dollars.\par \par \uc2 Sen. Jane Nelson, R-Flower Mound, and Rep. John Otto, R-Dayton, the budget chairs in each chamber, said they understood the wisdom of Hegar's advice but neither could predict when or how lawmakers would act. The website for the Texas Tomorrow Funds boldly proclaims "time is on your side now." Without prompt legislative action, time will be working against Texas taxpayers.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 Austin American-Statesman. March 19, 2015.\par \par \uc2 Lawmakers need to listen to all Texans on gun rights bills\par \par \uc2 Last week at the Texas Capitol saw a steady march of gun rights bills from \uc2 the Senate\uc2  to the House catering to small-but-vocal portions of the electorate, with a complete disregard for the voices of those that these new laws might affect.\par \par \uc2 Open carry. Campus carry. Both measures were passed out of \uc2 the Senate\uc2  over the objections of law enforcement, still considered part of a core Republican political base. In the case of campus carry, students, faculty groups and even chancellors asked lawmakers to put the brakes on the bill, or at minimum, give public higher education institutions the ability to decide for themselves whether to allow guns on campus grounds, just like their private counterparts.\par \par \uc2 Sen. Sylvia R. Garcia summed it up best: "The people of Texas don't want this bill. The administrators don't want this bill. Faculty doesn't want this bill. Workers and employees don't want this bill. Students don't want this bill," said the Houston Democrat about SB 11, the bill that expands concealed handgun license privileges to college campuses. "Why are we doing this?"\par \par \uc2 As worrisome as the prospect of expanding access to guns on campus may be, the disregard for those who have to live with the Legislature's decisions is even more distressing, especially when there are more pressing issues to address.\par \par \uc2 The strongest signal of support for the state's higher education system has come from Texas A & M Chancellor John Sharp, who wrote to Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, "Having licensed gun owners in possession of legal weapons on our campuses does not raise safety concerns for me personally. The real question is this: 'Do I trust my students, faculty and staff to work and live responsibly under the same laws at the university as they do at home?' Of course I do! However, properly funding the higher education of these students is the only issue that counts!"\par \par \uc2 Sharp's statement is not quite the same thing as "We need campus carry now for our own protection." In fact, his statement sounds more like, "Let's get this over with, so we can move on to more important state business like paying for new campus facilities and restoring higher education funding."\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 University of Texas\uc2  System Chancellor William McRaven, a former Navy Seal, was clear in his opposition to the measure, saying that it would make his campuses "less safe."\par \par \uc2 In the case of open carry legislation, the resistance from affected parties \u8212\'20\'14 especially law enforcement \u8212\'20\'14 is even louder, with official opposition from the \uc2 Combined Law Enforcement Associations of Texas\uc2  (CLEAT) and a vast majority of Texas police chiefs, including Austin Chief Art Acevedo and Houston Police Chief Charles McClelland.\par \par \uc2 The resounding concern is that open carry will make the job of keeping Texans safe harder, not easier, for law enforcement. And in an era where law enforcement is facing increasing criticism for its use of force, we are inclined to agree with them. Officers are under incredible pressure to make split-second decisions about who is a real threat to themselves and others; increasing the visibility and number of firearms in the public square does not seem likely to improve the situation.\par \par \uc2 Sentiment around expanded gun laws may be passionate, but it is hardly universal \u8212\'20\'14 even in Texas. Despite the lengthy roster of speakers who testified in favor of the expansion of the state's gun laws, polling suggest that initiatives are not top of mind for most Texans. According to a joint poll by the \uc2 University of Texas\uc2  and the Texas Tribune, only 32 percent of Texans would allow open carry \u8212\'20\'14 some with a license, some without. The rest would prefer the state stick to its existing gun laws (45 percent) or ban handguns all together (23 percent).\par \par \uc2 The fact that the gun-related bills have gotten such a warm reception in \uc2 the Senate\uc2  is hardly a surprise, given the political proclivities of Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who promised to put the issue at the top of his agenda. It remains to be seen how the House responds.\par \par \uc2 We urge them to proceed carefully and listen to their constituents, not just vocal gun rights advocates. Many of these groups have no intention of stopping with expansions of concealed handgun rights; they continue to lobby hard for license-free open carry, elimination of fingerprinting licensees and loosening criminal background check requirements for gun purchases in lockstep with the \uc2 National Rifle Association\uc2 's agenda.\par \par \uc2 It is true that the \uc2 U.S. Supreme Court\uc2  in 2008 found outright bans to handgun possession unconstitutional and ruled that the Second Amendment guarantees an individual right to gun ownership, but as recently as last June the court continues to hold that some laws to regulate ownership of fire arms are within the government's statutory discretion.\par \par \uc2 The pursuit of an agenda that is 100 percent ideology-based bodes ill for Texas' future. True representation means doing what's in the best interest of the state and listening to the will of all the people.\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020150324eb3o0056q\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 CASABLANCA, Morocco (AP) \u8212\'20\'14 Marthe N'Dri began her beauty business in Morocco by going to people's homes to do braids and hair weaves, using skills she picked up as a beautician in her native Ivory Coast.\par \par \uc2 Now she's ready to expand her tiny corner stall in the narrow warren of alleys known as the Senegalese Market in Casablanca. She plans to install a chair next to the racks of hair extensions, cosmetics, plantains and bags of manioc, and make her fellow migrants beautiful \u8212\'20\'14 with the help of local organization providing funds and business advice to newcomers.\par \par \uc2 It is simple dreams like this that could be the future face of immigration in Morocco. African migrants who originally planned to make the perilous crossing from Morocco to Europe are increasingly deciding instead to set up shop in the North African kingdom, taking advantage of new laws that make it easier for the migrants to obtain permanent residency and work permits here.\par \par \uc2 "I need a bit of help to grow my business so that I can move forward," said N'dri, thanking the organization that gave her the money to start her shop. "There was no one else."\par \par \uc2 Over the past year, Morocco has been working to grant legal status to the tens of thousands of immigrants who arrive with European dreams to give them an opportunity to settle and take advantage of the health and education system. Already 27,000 migrants living in Morocco have applied for papers and 18,000 \u8212\'20\'14 including all of the women and children who applied \u8212\'20\'14 have received residency.\par \par \uc2 One new addition to the program, announced last month, is to help the immigrants start small businesses. For now, the business program is restricted to registered refugees and funded by the \uc2 U.N\uc2 . But soon it will be expanded with funding from the \uc2 European Union\uc2  to all migrants in Morocco with legal status. Morocco has been under pressure from its European neighbors to stem the flow of migrants using the country as a transit point, and that pressure has been a catalyst for the new immigration policy.\par \par \uc2 If the laws are now favorable for migrants in Morocco, they are also getting a boost from organizations teaching the newcomers how to make it in an unfamiliar land. N'Dri is being advised by the Moroccan Association to Support and Promote Small Businesses, known by the French acronym, AMAPPE, which helped set up her business and is now overseeing her plan to expand it.\par \par \uc2 The fact that N'Dri, who came as an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  four years ago, is able to get such advice is a mark of how much Morocco has changed in its attitudes toward immigration.\par \par \uc2 "Moroccan society is in the process of changing, is becoming aware that there are foreign migrants, that they need to work, that they need to live with dignity, that they need the same rights to work, to housing, to health care as Moroccans," said the director of AMAPPE, Said Makhon. The organization has so far given business support to 300 people and trained another 90.\par \par \uc2 Caseworkers at AMAPPE will review migrants' business plans and then decide how best the organization can help them out with small grants.\par \par \uc2 The immigrants who decide to stay, however, face challenges making it in a poor country with 10 percent unemployment and a low growth rate. Many complain about racism. And in cities like Tangiers there have been frequent clashes between poor Moroccan youths and immigrants. Entrepreneurs like N'Dri often target their businesses at fellow migrants.\par \par \uc2 But in the capital Rabat, Fabien Manzingo, from the country once known as Zaire, is aiming his latest business venture squarely at a Moroccan clientele in the working class neighborhood of Taqadoum.\par \par \uc2 Unlike the others, Manzingo came here for work. He was the bodyguard for ousted dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, who took refuge in Morocco after being kicked out in 1997 by Laurent Kabila; the new leader renamed the country the Democratic Republic of Congo.\par \par \uc2 Following Mobutu's death, Manzingo worked a string of jobs. His latest effort, thanks to start-up funding from AMAPPE, is Cafe Ouarzazate, cooking popular Moroccan lunch and breakfast dishes.\par \par \uc2 He has hired a cook and bought basic equipment, and now it's just a matter of becoming a neighborhood fixture.\par \par \uc2 "It's very, very difficult, but we have to, there is no other way to do anything else," he said. "We have a saying among ourselves, life is a battle."\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 Paul Schemm contributed from Rabat.\par \par \uc2 In this photo taken Tuesday, Feb. 24, 2015 Ivory Coast's Marthe N\u8217\'20\'19Dri, right, works in her cosmetics and food products shop in the Senegalese souk in Casablanca, Morocco.

Next to the racks of hair extensions, cosmetics, plantains and bags of manioc, the plan is to put in a chair and do makeovers with the help of local organization providing business advice to immigrants. It is simple dreams like this that could be the future face of immigration in Morocco.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 LOS ANGELES (AP) \u8212\'20\'14 A homeless man killed by Los Angeles police had been released last May from a federal prison after serving roughly 14 years for bank robbery, and was wanted for violating probation, a law enforcement official said Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 A federal warrant was issued Jan. 9 for 39-year-old Charley Saturmin Robinet after he didn't provide monthly reports to a probation officer in November, December and January, Deputy U.S. Marshal Matthew Cordova said.\par \par \uc2 A law enforcement official identified the man known as Robinet as the person killed Sunday by police. The official wasn't authorized to speak publicly and talked to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.\par \par \uc2 Robinet was released from prison on May 12 after being convicted of three federal charges in 2000 for holding up a \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  branch and pistol-whipping an employee to pay for acting classes.\par \par \uc2 Axel Cruau, the consul general for France in Los Angeles, said the man known as Robinet had stolen the identity of a French citizen and was living in the U.S. under that name after applying for a French passport in the late 1990s.\par \par \uc2 The bank robbery arrest spurred the consulate to provide Robinet with support, but officials later realized he is not French, Cruau said.\par \par \uc2 "The real Charley Robinet is in France apparently living a totally normal life and totally unaware his identity had been stolen years and years ago," Cruau said.\par \par \uc2 While in the federal prison in Rochester, Minnesota, the man known as Robinet was assigned to the mental health unit and federal officials said medical staff determined he was suffering from "a mental disease or defect" that required treatment in a psychiatric hospital, documents show.\par \par \uc2 Robinet, who acknowledged being an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , was arrested along with an accomplice and a getaway driver after they tried to rob the bank.\par \par \uc2 Robinet was killed Sunday after a confrontation with police. Authorities say he tried to grab a probationary officer's gun and three officers fatally shot him.\par \par \uc2 The three officers who fired their weapons in a videotaped struggle that left a homeless man dead were veterans of the Skid Row beat who had special training to deal with mentally ill and other people in the downtrodden area, police leaders said.\par \par \uc2 But a recently-hired officer who cried out that the man had his gun, leading to the shooting, had considerably less experience, and police didn't immediately say how much training he had received in dealing with mentally ill people. All officers must go through at least an 11-hour course.\par \par \uc2 Police Chief Charlie Beck said some of the veteran officers had "completed our most extensive mental illness training over a 36-hour course." Initial signs showed the officers used what they had learned during the confrontation, despite the outcome, he said.\par \par \uc2 The shooting was captured on video but exactly what happened remained unclear. The footage has been viewed by millions of people online.\par \par \uc2 Several dozen people rallied Tuesday in protest of the shooting. There was a moment of silence, and participant Patrisse Cullors declared the shooting site to be "sacred ground."\par \par \uc2 A memorial at the site of the shooting features white roses placed over a tent, blankets and clothing belonging to the man known as "Africa."\par \par \uc2 Footage showed the homeless man reaching toward the recently-hired officer's waistband, Beck said. The officer's gun was later found partly cocked and jammed with a round of ammunition in the chamber and another in the ejection port, indicating a struggle for the weapon, Beck said.\par \par \uc2 "You can hear the young officer who was primarily engaged in the confrontation saying that 'He has my gun. He has my gun,'" Beck said. "He says it several times, with conviction."\par \par \uc2 The three other officers then opened fire.\par \par \uc2 The man who was shot was black, as is the recently-hired officer who was just short of completing his probationary year on the force, police said.\par \par \uc2 The violence had echoes of the August police shooting of 25-year-old Ezell Ford, whose death in a struggle with Los Angeles officers brought demonstrations in the city. Ford was unarmed. Police said he was shot after reaching for an officer's gun.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 Tami Abdollah can be reached at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.twitter.com/latams"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.twitter.com/latams}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Los Angeles Police detective Meghan Aguilar points at photos released by police that could indicate evidence of a suspect holding a police officer's gun, seen in a video grab scene shot by a witness at the scene of the shooting of a homeless man on Skid Row of Los Angeles, displayed at a news conference at police headquarters Monday, March 2, 2015.

"I watched the video, I watched the tragic events on Skid Row unfold," the mayor said. "We owe the city a thorough investigation as to what happened." The shooting was caught by at least four cameras, two held by witnesses and two worn by officers who fired their weapons. There was also a camera in a police car and a security camera on a nearby shelter that may have captured footage.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ST. LOUIS (AP) \u8212\'20\'14 A Bosnian immigrant accused of funneling money and military supplies to terror groups in Iraq and Syria will remain in federal custody, after her lawyer told a judge Wednesday that he wants clarity on her immigration status before seeking bond.\par \par \uc2 Sedina Hodzic, 35, is among six people named in a federal indictment earlier this month. Her husband, Ramiz Hodzic, and another man were also named, along with two people from Illinois and one from New York State.\par \par \uc2 Sedina Hodzic's attorney, Paul D'Agrosa, waived her request to be released on bond during a brief court appearance, but said he will revisit the request once her immigration status is made clear.\par \par \uc2 Afterward, D'Agrosa said that immigration authorities would detain Hodzic if she were freed, so she would simply move from one jail to another.\par \par \uc2 "I don't want to say she's an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  because I don't believe that's true," D'Agrosa said of his client, who has been in the U.S. 18 years. But, "There are too many uncertainties."\par \par \uc2 The indictment says that the Hodzics have been living in the U.S. as refugees. A message seeking comment Wednesday from a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services spokesman was not immediately returned.\par \par \uc2 D'Agrosa said there is concern about Hodzic's three children, ages 16, 12 and not quite 2. The children are staying with a friend while both parents are jailed.\par \par \uc2 Ramiz Hodzic, 40, faces a detention hearing Friday.\par \par \uc2 All six suspects are Bosnian immigrants accused of using \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 PayPal\uc2 , \uc2 Western Union\uc2  and the \uc2 U.S. Postal Service\uc2  to coordinate shipments of money and supplies to terror groups, including one affiliated with \uc2 al-Qaida\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The indictment accuses Ramiz Hodzic of making 10 wire transfers totaling $8,850, and arranging two shipments of military supplies valued at $2,451. Sedina Hodzic is accused of aiding one of those transfers and shipping six boxes of military supplies to an intermediary in Turkey.\par \par \uc2 The indictment alleges that the Hodzics were helped by Abdullah Ramo Pazara, another Bosnian immigrant who left St. Louis in May 2013 to fight in Syria. Authorities say he died in Syria.\par \par \uc2 About 70,000 Bosnian immigrants live in the St. Louis area, the largest population of Bosnian refugees in the U.S. Most are Muslim and arrived after the war that broke out in the early 1990s.\par \par \uc2 Leaders of the St. Louis Bosnian community have distanced themselves from the suspects, saying immigrants in St. Louis have worked tirelessly to embrace their adopted home.\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020150218eb2i007sr\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ST. LOUIS (AP) \u8212\'20\'14 A Bosnian immigrant accused of funneling money and military supplies to terror groups in Iraq and Syria will remain in federal custody, after her lawyer told a judge Wednesday that he wants clarity on her immigration status before seeking bond.\par \par \uc2 Sedina Hodzic, 35, of St. Louis County, is among six people named in a federal indictment earlier this month. Her husband, Ramiz Hodzic, and another St. Louis County man were also named, along with two people from Illinois and one from New York State.\par \par \uc2 Sedina Hodzic's attorney, Paul D'Agrosa, waived her request to be released on bond during a brief court appearance, but said he will revisit the request once her immigration status is made clear.\par \par \uc2 Afterward, D'Agrosa said that immigration authorities would detain Hodzic if she were freed, so she would simply move from one jail to another.\par \par \uc2 "I don't want to say she's an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  because I don't believe that's true," D'Agrosa said of his client, who has been in the U.S. 18 years. But, "There are too many uncertainties."\par \par \uc2 The indictment says that the Hodzics have been living in the U.S. as refugees. A message seeking comment Wednesday from a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services spokesman was not immediately returned.\par \par \uc2 D'Agrosa said there is concern about Hodzic's three children, ages 16, 12 and not quite 2. The children are staying with a friend while both parents are jailed.\par \par \uc2 Ramiz Hodzic, 40, faces a detention hearing Friday.\par \par \uc2 All six suspects are Bosnian immigrants accused of using \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 PayPal\uc2 , \uc2 Western Union\uc2  and the \uc2 U.S. Postal Service\uc2  to coordinate shipments of money and supplies to terror groups, including one affiliated with \uc2 al-Qaida\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Last week, a federal judge in Chicago refused to release Mediha Medy Salkicevic, 34, of Schiller Park, Illinois. Detention hearing dates have not been set for Armin Harcevic, 37, of St. Louis County; Jasminka Ramic, 42, of Rockford, Illinois; and Nihad Rosic, 26, of Utica, New York.\par \par \uc2 The indictment accuses Ramiz Hodzic of making 10 wire transfers totaling $8,850, and arranging two shipments of military supplies valued at $2,451. Sedina Hodzic is accused of aiding one of those transfers and shipping six boxes of military supplies to an intermediary in Turkey.\par \par \uc2 The indictment alleges that the Hodzics were helped by Abdullah Ramo Pazara, another Bosnian immigrant who left St. Louis in May 2013 to fight in Syria. Authorities say he died in Syria.\par \par \uc2 Ramiz Hodzic and Rosic are also charged with conspiring to kill and maim persons abroad. Rosic is accused of trying to board a Norwegian Airlines flight in New York in July, with plans to travel to Syria to fight alongside Pazara and others.\par \par \uc2 About 70,000 Bosnian immigrants live in the St. Louis area, the largest population of Bosnian refugees in the U.S. Most are Muslim and arrived after the war that broke out in the early 1990s.\par \par \uc2 Leaders of the St. Louis Bosnian community have distanced themselves from the suspects, saying immigrants in St. Louis have worked tirelessly to embrace their adopted home.\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020150218eb2i007sn\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) \u8212\'20\'14 Civil rights groups have filed lawsuits against New Mexico and the state's tax department alleging that refunds are being withheld illegally from people filing taxes using federal tax ID numbers.\par \par \uc2 The two lawsuits were filed in state court Thursday on behalf of a couple and two other workers. They seek refunds and an injunction to block what the organizations call an "unlawful and discriminatory practice" that kept hundreds of dollars from the workers and millions more from other New Mexico taxpayers.\par \par \uc2 Lawyers for the \uc2 Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund\uc2  and the statewide immigrant rights group Somos Un Pueblo Unido accused the state Taxation and Revenue Department of quietly instituting an illegal policy, overstepping its authority and violating the state constitutional rights of the workers.\par \par \uc2 The attorneys said the department in 2012 began a policy of denying tax refunds to New Mexico residents who are foreign nationals and who file returns using their federally issued tax ID.\par \par \uc2 Taxation and Revenue Secretary Demesia Padilla called the allegations "a bogus political charade."\par \par \uc2 "They're asking us to turn a blind eye when illegal immigrants seek tax refunds using tax returns that have fraudulent Social Security numbers. That's ridiculous," Padilla said in a statement.\par \par \uc2 Gabriela Ibanez Guzman, staff attorney for Somos Un Pueblo Unido, suggested that the tax policy is part of a "disturbing pattern" by Gov. \uc2 Susana Martinez\uc2 's administration to single out and punish immigrant families.\par \par \uc2 "Discriminating against immigrants and withholding their hard-earned money negatively impacts their U.S. born children and local economies," she said.\par \par \uc2 According to the lawsuits, the department reported it had sent more than 14,500 discrepancy letters since 2012 seeking supporting documents from taxpayers who filed their state income taxes using a federally issued ID. That resulted in more than $4 million in withheld refunds.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, the same people have been receiving federal refunds from the \uc2 IRS\uc2 , lawyers for the workers said.\par \par \uc2 Tax department spokesman S.U. Mahesh says every return goes through a screening process to identify discrepancies, inconsistencies, security concerns and other red flags. When an issue is identified, a review is triggered.\par \par \uc2 "This screening process appropriately flags when an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  uses an ITIN (the federally-issued individual tax identification number) to file a tax return, along with a W2 form containing a fraudulent Social Security number belonging to someone else," Mahesh said. That's when the department seeks additional information from filers.\par \par \uc2 The change in processing of taxes in 2012 occurred because the department discovered the "widespread nature of this problem, that an incredibly large number of Social Security numbers were being used in employment paperwork attached to taxpayers who didn't have" them, Mahesh said.\par \par \uc2 From 2013 through now, the department has sent about 23,800 letters, he said.\par \par \uc2 "The department has processes in place to safeguard the integrity of New Mexican's tax returns," he said. "The goal is simply to ensure the rightful taxpayers receive their refunds and not those who have stolen someone's identity."\par \par \uc2 When filers provide documentation with basic information confirming their identity, such as paystubs or letters from their employers, the department releases their refunds, Mahesh said.\par \par \uc2 Lawyers said the workers have submitted the required documentation.\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020150212eb2c005yg\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc62}{\*\bkmkend toc62}\b \uc2 Clouds remain as Kitzhaber begins 4th term\b0\par\par\uc2 By JONATHAN J. COOPER   \par \uc2 Associated Press\par \uc2 664 \uc2 words\par \uc2 10 January 2015\par 13:04\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2015.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SALEM, Ore. (AP) \u8212\'20\'14 Gov. John Kitzhaber enters his fourth term Monday with the dark clouds of his third lingering.\par \par \uc2 After a largely successful start to his second stint in the governor's office, Kitzhaber hit setbacks with the troubled Cover Oregon health insurance exchange and revelations about his fiancee's personal life and business arrangements.\par \par \uc2 When he gives the inaugural address Monday, he'll lay out a vision for the next four years and try to turn the corner. It won't be easy.\par \par \uc2 In the coming months, a state ethics commission could rule on whether Kitzhaber's fiancee, Cylvia Hayes, broke the law with her business arrangements. And the Legislature will likely vote to dismantle Cover Oregon, the failed health insurance exchange that was supposed to be one of Kitzhaber's signature accomplishments.\par \par \uc2 Kitzhaber handily defeated state Rep. Dennis Richardson to win re-election last year, but the campaign was bitter.\par \par \uc2 The governor and his partner faced difficult questions about Hayes' personal and professional lives. Hayes tearfully admitted in October that, as a college student in the 1990s, she accepted cash to illegally marry an immigrant seeking a green card.\par \par \uc2 More damaging, however, was the revelation that Hayes did paid consulting work for organizations that were interested in influencing state policy. Kitzhaber insists she did nothing wrong. Acting on two complaints filed by Republicans, the Oregon Government Ethics Commission is investigating whether state conflict-of-interest laws apply to Hayes and, if so, whether she violated them.\par \par \uc2 The questions about Hayes came on the heels of the Cover Oregon website failure, which stunted Kitzhaber's ambition to make the state a model for the implementation of the federal health care law. Oregon and its main technology vendor, \uc2 Oracle Inc\uc2 ., are now pointing blame at each other in a legal battle that will likely ensnare much of Kitzhaber's fourth term unless he and Attorney General \uc2 Ellen Rosenblum\uc2  agree to settle.\par \par \uc2 Despite the setbacks, Kitzhaber does begin his new term with some advantages. The economy is improving. Revenue is growing. The Democratic governor has more Democrats in the Legislature than he had in any of his previous 12 years as chief executive \u8212\'20\'14 18 out of 30 senators, 35 of the 60 House seats.\par \par \uc2 On Monday, House lawmakers will take the oath of office, followed by senators. Kitzhaber will then be sworn in, flanked by Hayes, and will give his inaugural address to a joint session of the Legislature.\par \par \uc2 Kitzhaber's office said Friday that his speech "will look back at what the state has been able to accomplish over the past four years, and ahead to the work that still needs to be done to ensure that all Oregonians are able to meet their basic needs, support their families, and see a path to a more prosperous future."\par \par \uc2 Jim Moore, a political science professor at Pacific University in Forest Grove, predicted that Kitzhaber's address won't dwell on the problems of the past year.\par \par \uc2 "The best thing, aside form maybe a quip, is probably just to ignore it," Moore said.\par \par \uc2 Kitzhaber has served longer than any other governor in Oregon history. Prohibited by term limits from seeking another consecutive term, Kitzhaber insists his fourth term will be his last.\par \par \uc2 FILE--In this Jan. 10, 2011 file photo, Democrat John Kitzhaber, left, is sworn in as Oregon governor while Cylvia Hayes stands at right as the 76th Oregon Legislature begins in Salem, Ore.  Kitzhaber won a historic fourth term in November, even though he was buffeted by revelations about his fiancee, Hayes, when she tearfully admitted that as a college student she married an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  so he could get a green card and she could get $5,000 to buy a computer and by allegations that she used her role as an adviser to Kitzhaber to profit her business as a private consultant.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) \u8212\'20\'14 President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  on Tuesday tried to reassure immigrants that if they register under his new executive action they won't be a priority for deportation in the future, while acknowledging another president could undo it all.\par \par \uc2 Obama\uc2  heard from several participants in an hourlong town hall at an immigrant community center that they are fearful to give their information to the government. One young woman asked \uc2 Obama\uc2  what would happen to them if the next president ends the program.\par \par \uc2 Obama\uc2  said although the assurance they won't be deported is temporary, he's confident they will be able to stay in the United States with their children.\par \par \uc2 "It's true that a future administration might try to reverse some of our policies," \uc2 Obama\uc2  said. "But I'll be honest with you, I think that the American people basically have a good heart and want to treat people fairly.\par \par \uc2 "I think any future administration that tried to punish people for doing the right thing would not have the support of the American people," he said.\par \par \uc2 He said giving people the confidence they can register will be an important part of the program's success.\par \par \uc2 Obama\uc2  recently used his executive authority to extend deportation relief and work permits to some 4 million immigrants in the U.S. illegally. His action would affect those who have been here more than five years and have children.\par \par \uc2 Obama\uc2  argued that immigration can help boost the economy, and to drive home the point he later picked up dinner to go at La Hacienda Taqueria. The White House said the business started out as a small taco stand in 1993 and now is a successful family-run restaurant and market.\par \par \uc2 Republican Tennessee Gov. \uc2 Bill Haslam\uc2 , who did not attend \uc2 Obama\uc2 's event, said the current immigration system isn't working, but \uc2 Obama\uc2  should have worked with lawmakers on a solution instead of taking executive action.\par \par \uc2 "I think this was kind of rolling a hand grenade in room and blew up the possibility for a good discussion that we should have had, and that long term it will be harmful to really solving the immigration situation," Haslam told reporters after a speech to the Farm Bureau in Franklin, Tennessee.\par \par \uc2 Obama\uc2  said Americans may not think about Nashville as a gateway to America, but noted that the city has one of the nation's fastest-growing immigrant communities and is home to the largest Kurdish population in the U.S. "They are us," \uc2 Obama\uc2  said. And, he added: "They make the food better."\par \par \uc2 Obama\uc2  said he recognizes it will be hard to convince some Republicans to work with him on immigration. "They're pretty sure I'm an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 ," \uc2 Obama\uc2  said, pausing before adding: "That was a joke."\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 Associated Press writer Erik Schelzig in Franklin, Tennessee, contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 Follow Nedra Pickler on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://twitter.com/nedrapickler"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://twitter.com/nedrapickler}}}\par \par \uc2 President Barack Obama rolls up his sleeves while being asked a question about his recent executive actions on immigration, Tuesday, Dec. 9, 2014, at Casa Azafran in Nashville, Tenn.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) \u8212\'20\'14 The number of people who died trying to cross the U.S.-Mexico border has dropped to the lowest level in 15 years as more immigrants turned themselves in to authorities in Texas and fewer took their chances with the dangerous trek across the Arizona desert.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 U.S. government\uc2  recorded 307 deaths in the 2014 fiscal year that ended in September \u8212\'20\'14 the lowest number since 1999. In 2013, the number of deaths was 445.\par \par \uc2 The Border Patrol's Rio Grande Valley sector finished the 2014 budget year with 115 deaths, compared with 107 in the Tucson sector, according to figures obtained by The Associated Press. It marks the first time since 2001 that Arizona has not been the deadliest place to cross the border.\par \par \uc2 Arizona has long been the most dangerous border region because of triple-digit temperatures, rough desert terrain and the sheer volume of immigrants coming in to the state from Mexico. But more immigrants are now entering through Texas and not Arizona, driven by a surge of people from Central America.\par \par \uc2 The Tucson and Rio Grande Valley both saw their numbers of deaths decline from 2013, although Arizona's drop was more precipitous.\par \par \uc2 Border enforcement officials say the lower numbers are in part due to increased rescue efforts as well as a Spanish-language media campaign discouraging Latin Americans from walking across the border.\par \par \uc2 Tucson Sector Division Chief Raleigh Leonard says the addition of 10 new rescue beacons that were strategically placed in areas where immigrants traverse most often has been a factor in the decrease in deaths.\par \par \uc2 "I think we can all agree that crossing the border is an illegal act, but nothing that should be assigned the penalty of death," Leonard said in an interview.\par \par \uc2 Immigrant rights advocates are skeptical that it is solely the Border Patrol's efforts contributing to the decrease in deaths.\par \par \uc2 "At best, what the Border Patrol is accomplishing is a geographical shift in where these deaths are happening \u8212\'20\'14 rather than adequately responding to the scale of the crisis," said Geoffrey Boyce, a border enforcement and immigration researcher at the \uc2 University of Arizona\uc2  and a volunteer with the Tucson-based nonprofit No More Deaths.\par \par \uc2 The Rio Grande Valley sector was flooded with a surge in unaccompanied minors and families with children who turned themselves in at border crossings in Texas. Most were from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, where gang violence and a poor economy have driven out huge numbers of people. That surge has dwindled recently, however, as U.S. and Central American authorities have launched a public relations campaign warning parents against sending their children to the U.S.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, the Tucson Sector, once the busiest in the nation, has seen a steep decline in border crossers. Fewer Mexicans are crossing into the U.S. as the economy here has faltered and drug violence at home has improved.\par \par \uc2 The Border Patrol also responds to hundreds of cases each year of immigrants who need to be rescued while crossing the desert, long an issue in the Arizona desert. The Border Patrol conducted 509 rescues in the 2014 fiscal year in the Tucson sector, compared to 802 in 2013.\par \par \uc2 Some of the rescues are made with the help of beacons that were activated 142 times this year. The beacons are 30-feet tall, solar-powered and have sun reflectors and blue lights on top that are visible for 10 miles. The beacons also have signs in three languages directing users to push a red button that sends out a signal for help. Agents respond usually within 10 minutes to an hour.\par \par \uc2 The agency has a team dedicated solely to rescues, called Border Patrol Search, Trauma, and Rescue.\par \par \uc2 Agents in this elite group spend their days searching for immigrants and responding when one seeks help. They assist not only those who cross the border in search for jobs, but also drug mules and smugglers who become injured or dehydrated in the summer heat.\par \par \uc2 It was only 10 a.m. and already 95 degrees on a day in late June when the unit's agents provided medical assistance to a 28-year-old man suspected of smuggling drugs near Sells, Arizona.\par \par \uc2 The thin man had an ID from El Salvador and said he lived in Tucson. He oscillated between Spanish and English, but his message was the same: He was in extreme pain.\par \par \uc2 The agents gave him a gallon of a sports beverage. He was to drink it slowly, they told him, or else it would make him sick. Next, they connected a saline bag intravenously and checked his vitals.\par \par \uc2 The agents monitored him and re-examined his vitals, concluding that he wasn't dehydrated but suffering from muscle fatigue. Minutes later, agents who used a drug-sniffing K-9 to search the area found several bundles of marijuana and another suspected smuggler.\par \par \uc2 The men were arrested on suspicion of being in the country illegally, but were not charged with smuggling because the loads of marijuana were not found on them.\par \par \uc2 "To us, it could be a mule, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . They're all the same. They're human beings," Leonard said.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 Alicia A.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.  \par \par \uc2 LOS REYES LA PAZ, Mexico (AP) \u8212\'20\'14 A \uc2 Harvard University\uc2  student stuck in Mexico for months after breaking an immigration rule was told Tuesday that he will be allowed to return home to the United States.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service\uc2  had declared that Dario Guerrero Meneses, an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 , effectively deported himself when he crossed the border without permission to accompany his dying mother to clinics offering alternative cancer treatments in Mexico.\par \par \uc2 His mother died in August, and the agency denied Guerrero's initial attempts to return home to his remaining family in California.\par \par \uc2 But only hours after The Associated Press reported on his predicament Tuesday, the agency sent Guerrero a letter through his attorney saying he had been granted humanitarian parole and will be allowed to return after all.\par \par \uc2 "Oh my God. I don't know. I feel good!" Guerrero said as the news brought tears of joy to his aunts and cousins. Guerrero said he was excited to resume his education and take up new family responsibilities.\par \par \uc2 This parole is temporary. It lasts for two years and does not give him legal residency, let alone a clear path to U.S. citizenship.\par \par \uc2 Guerrero, who was brought from Mexico to California by his parents at the age of 2 and only learned of his illegal status as a young adult, was one of hundreds of thousands of young people granted a reprieve from deportation in 2012 by the Obama administration.\par \par \uc2 "The \uc2 U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service\uc2  did a great thing," his attorney Alan Klein said. "He should be back in America in a few days."\par \par \uc2 "This is the perfect (humanitarian parole) case," Klein added. "He knew that he could possibly give up his right to be here so he could take care of his mother. He's the reason we have immigration, and he's the reason we have a Statue of Liberty because he is what we want here."\par \par \uc2 Immigrants in Guerrero's situation aren't allowed to leave the U.S. without government approval, and Guerrero tried to get it.\par \par \uc2 He said he applied through the normal process for travel permission, and then waited a month and a half for a response as his mother's life ebbed away. He twice submitted requests for fast-track handling, and was told to more fully document his mother's condition. He could have tried to plead his case in person but left instead.\par \par \uc2 "My mom had a lot of ups and downs," he said. The chemotherapy and the radiation were no longer working. Doctors had already removed one kidney. "The decision to actually leave was made overnight."\par \par \uc2 Guerrero, who has been staying with his grandparents in a gang-controlled suburb of Mexico City, knew his effort to get an exemption from the rules was a long shot: Last year, the agency approved only about a third of the humanitarian parole petitions it received.\par \par \uc2 Agency spokesman Chris Bentley said earlier Tuesday that "immigration law is complex; anyone considering taking an immigration action needs to clearly understand the potential consequences of that action first."\par \par \uc2 Miami-based immigration attorney Ira Kurzban says it's not infrequent for immigrants to lose their legal status by leaving the country without permission. Some go on cruises thinking they haven't really left the U.S., or leave for family emergencies, only to discover they're barred from returning for 10 years.\par \par \uc2 "There's no question (Guerrero) didn't follow the rules. The question is what the penalty should be," Kurzban said.\par \par \uc2 Advocates say traveling should be made easier for immigrants who have lived in the U.S. for many years. Visas for skilled H-1B temporary workers already allow travel internationally without preapproval, and giving others this freedom would reduce heartbreak and add only minimal administrative work, Kurzban said.\par \par \uc2 But no such provisions were included in last year's immigration reform bills, and they aren't expected to be included in any executive action President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  might announce later this year. Kurzban thinks that's because the issue affects a relatively small group, and there are so many other priorities.\par \par \uc2 Former \uc2 Harvard\uc2  lecturer Eoin Cannon, who taught history to Guerrero, described him as "one of the most thoughtful and creative and original students that I had the pleasure of teaching," and "an exceptional writer." Guerrero tackled homelessness in one film, and co-produced "A Dream Deferred," a documentary about immigrants like himself at \uc2 Harvard\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "He's as American as anyone I know," Cannon said. "The law needs to sort of recognize that and have a mechanism for accounting for that ... For the law not to be able to handle his kind of case is hurting America."\par \par \uc2 Guerrero's parents had kept his immigration status secret for years. They came clean only when he began taking community-college engineering classes while still in high school, and the Social Security number his parents submitted bounced back.\par \par \uc2 Guerrero's 16-year-old brother also was by their mother's side when Rocio Meneses Diaz died Aug. 14 at the age of 41 in the central Mexican state of Guanajuato. As a U.S.-born citizen, he was allowed to travel freely.\par \par \uc2 Their father, a building contractor in the U.S. illegally, stayed behind with their 9-year-old sister, also a citizen, at their home in Long Beach. Guerrero now thinks his mother would have been happier living her final days there.\par \par \uc2 "But then we still had hope \u8212\'20\'14 and if we delayed that treatment any longer because of immigration issues, I don't think I would have been able to forgive myself," he said.\par \par \uc2 Before her death, Guerrero's mom opened up about the family's past and her reasons for leaving Mexico: Her father had been kidnapped twice; her father-in-law and other relatives faced extortion; armed thieves broke into her clothing and jewelry store, holding a knife to her stomach.\par \par \uc2 He recorded her stories and her struggle with kidney cancer. Now he plans to turn it into a documentary when he returns for \uc2 Harvard\uc2 's spring semester.\par \par \uc2 Guerrero's mother taught him one more very important lesson.\par \par \uc2 As she got sicker, Guerrero learned that he was going to become a father, with a high school friend from Los Angeles whose baby girl is due this month.\par \par \uc2 He kept his distance during the pregnancy, scared of fatherhood. He kept it a secret from his parents, who pinned their hopes on his education.\par \par \uc2 But while filming his mother, he noticed how she reconnected with her father shortly before dying, in moments she recorded on her cellphone. Guerrero later found dozens of selfies of their intertwined hands.\par \par \uc2 "I started asking myself, when my daughter has a son, is she going to show pictures of me?" he said.\par \par \uc2 "I'm excited to go back, but I'm also scared," he explained. "I want to go back to school, of course. But I know now what kind of dad I want to be."\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 Laura Wides-Munoz reported this story from Miami and Cambridge, Massachusetts.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PUEBLO, Colo. (AP) \u8212\'20\'14 Sen. Mark Udall (D-Colo) and his Republican challenger, Rep. Cory Gardner, clashed in the most raucous debate yet of their neck-and-neck race Thursday night, arguing over which of them was too extreme to represent the state and angling for the slightest advantage days before mail-in ballots begin to arrive at voters' homes.\par \par \uc2 Control of \uc2 the Senate\uc2  could hinge on the outcome of the race, which has seen six months of bruising attack ads and remains deadlocked in public polls. The debate in Pueblo, a weathered steel town 114 miles south of Denver, was the candidates' third of the week but had a distinctly different feel because of a mix of local issues and a roaring crowd that was encouraged by the moderator to cheer for their candidate.\par \par \uc2 The two candidates argued over familiar issues of immigration, foreign policy and reproductive rights, as well as a new one, with Gardner proposing a ban on flights from countries afflicted with the Ebola outbreak. But one theme linked all their disagreements -- that the other was too extreme to represent a state evenly-divided between Democrats, Republicans and unaffiliated voters.\par \par \uc2 "While you're voting with president Obama 99 percent of the time, I will vote 100 percent of the time for the people of Colorado," Gardner said, citing a study that found Udall has only voted against the president's priorities 1 percent of the time.\par \par \uc2 Udall countered by saying Gardner was ranked the 10th-most conservative member of the House of Representatives -- to the right of former Rep. Tom Tancredo, a notorious immigration firebrand. "Congressman, I'm 100 percent sure your policies are wrong for the state of Colorado," Udall responded.\par \par \uc2 The crowd occasionally shouted down one of the candidates and often cheered lustily for their zingers, which flew fast and fierce. Gardner observed that "both Obama and Udall are five-letter words." Udall responded to one lengthy Gardner answer by saying: "Talk is not leadership."\par \par \uc2 On immigration, Udall criticized Gardner for not supporting citizenship for many of the 11 million people in the country illegally. Gardner countered that Udall had voted for a 2005 Republican bill that would make being an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  a felony. Gardner criticized Udall for being a "single-issue" candidate for hammering him on reproductive rights. Udall contended Gardner had spent his career "trampling on women's rights." And though the two men both support President Obama's plan to roll back the \uc2 Islamic State\uc2  in Syria and Iraq, they argued over who had been too slow to respond to the threat.\par \par \uc2 On Ebola, Udall slammed Gardner for voting to cut $300 million from the budget of the \uc2 Centers for Disease Control\uc2 . "That's not how we protect our country," Udall said.\par \par \uc2 Gardner said the \uc2 CDC\uc2  was funding jazzercise classes and massage and called for "a ban on all flights" from the West African nations afflicted with the virus.\par \par \uc2 The two candidates will meet for a final debate next week, as Colorado's brand-new mail election system kicks into gear. Ballots go out on Oct. 14 and citizens have until Election Day to register and get them to polling places.\par \par \uc2 Republicans need to net six seats to win control of \uc2 the Senate\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Follow Nicholas Riccardi on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://twitter.com/NickRiccardi"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://twitter.com/NickRiccardi}}}\uc2  .\par \par \uc2 Republican Corey Gardner, right, makes a point as Democratic opponent Mark Udall  listens during their debate for the Colorado U.S. Senate at Memorial Hall on Oct. 9, 2014 in Pueblo, Colo.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WICHITA, Kan. (AP) \u8212\'20\'14 A man accused of recruiting Chinese women to work at his Wichita massage parlors and coercing them into prostitution was sentenced to five years in prison Friday despite his plea for leniency.\par \par \uc2 Gary Kidgell, 45, of Waltham, Massachusetts, choked back tears when requesting a shorter sentence, saying he made a "very bad decision" to move to Kansas with his wife after his successful California construction-consulting firm collapsed in 2008. But the judge sided with prosecutors by handing down a sentence closer to the harsher end of his plea deal's prison range.\par \par \uc2 Kidgell pleaded guilty in May to charges of obstruction of justice and harboring an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 . His 50-year-old wife, Wichita resident Yan Zhang, was sentenced earlier this month to five years of probation after admitting to transporting a woman from China to work as a prostitute.\par \par \uc2 "When the economy collapsed, I made a very bad decision to join my wife in Wichita and open massage parlors \u8212\'20\'14 which led to what happened today," Kidgell told the judge. His attorney noted that Kidgell was facing homelessness at the time and had to apply for food stamps.\par \par \uc2 Authorities began investigating the couple's nine massage parlors in 2010, after detectives found Internet postings about sexual services. Undercover officers paid for massages, then were offered \u8212\'20\'14 and declined \u8212\'20\'14 sex acts for an added price, according to court documents.\par \par \uc2 During a search, officers found a notebook containing translations for sexually explicit phrases. They also found copy for ads in Chinese-language newspapers in New York, Chicago and San Francisco offering "massage parlor hiring" in Kansas.\par \par \uc2 His plea agreement called for between roughly 4 years and 5 years in prison. Assistant U.S. Attorney Jason Hart pushed for the longer sentence, noting Kidgell's history of domestic violence convictions and other crimes dating back to 1991. He said Kidgell had a longstanding use of "certain tactics of subjugating women to his will."\par \par \uc2 Defense attorney David Freund asked for a more lenient sentence, arguing that Kidgell had been living a productive life before moving to Kansas. He said his client was heavily using cocaine while living in Wichita and that the crimes never would have occurred had it not been for Kidgell's wife.\par \par \uc2 "It is pretty clear they had a tumultuous relationship," Freund said. "Sometimes she was the aggressor, sometimes he was."\par \par \uc2 During a hearing in April, a former worker at one of the parlors said she was rebuilding her life. The woman was sentenced to time served after spending more than six months in jail before pleading guilty to reduced charges of helping induce an immigrant to reside unlawfully in the U.S.\par \par \uc2 She said Kidgell and his wife encouraged her to perform sex acts at the parlors.\par \par \uc2 "Life with him was miserable and nasty," she said at her sentencing. "I am glad the government took him away from my life."\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020140822ea8m002hk\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Aberdeen American News, Aberdeen, July 24, 2014\par \par \uc2 Leave lasting legacy without opening a pocketbook\par \par \uc2 Recently, \uc2 CBS\uc2  reported that 127 of the world's 1,645 billionaires have joined The Giving Pledge.\par \par \uc2 This is a campaign started in 2010 by Bill and \uc2 Melinda Gates\uc2  and \uc2 Warren Buffett\uc2  to encourage billionaires to make a commitment to give away at least $500 million to philanthropic causes. There are only two requirements to join this billionaires' club: be worth at least a billion dollars and be willing to give half of that away.\par \par \uc2 The philanthropic causes are up to the individual member. Once a year, club members convene to talk about and share lessons in philanthropy and the best strategies for giving away vast amounts of money.\par \par \uc2 The Gates, who are worth $80.3 billion, according to Forbes in 2014, have committed to give away 95 percent of their wealth and Buffett, worth $63.1 billion, 99 percent. When \uc2 CBS\uc2  reporter Charlie Rose of "60 Minutes" asked the three about leaving money to their families, Buffett responded: "I don't really think that, as a society, we want to confer blessings on generation after generation who contribute nothing to society, simply because somebody in the far distant past happened to amass a great sum of wealth."\par \par \uc2 Buffett added that, when he telephones fellow billionaires to try to convince them to join the club, results are mixed.\par \par \uc2 "I've been tempted to think that if they can't sign up for 50 percent, maybe I should write a book on how to get by on $500 million. Because, apparently, there's a lot of people that don't really know how to do it," Buffett joked.\par \par \uc2 The idea of encouraging the wealthiest among us to give away half or more, or most, of their money is a good thing. The money from this billionaires' club has improved the lives of countless people.\par \par \uc2 Better that they spend their money on doing the right thing rather than indulging in possessions or pastimes they and their families don't need.\par \par \uc2 And maybe there needs to be a club like this for the rest of us.\par \par \uc2 Anyone can leave a lasting legacy. And you don't need to spend hundreds, thousands or millions of dollars to do it.\par \par \uc2 What if we would all pledge to do one nice thing a day? The examples are endless:\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 Give someone a compliment.\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 Listen instead of talk.\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 Pick up a piece of trash.\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 When the opportunity to criticize someone opens, close your mouth and walk away.\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 Be supportive of someone who is having a bad moment, experience or day.\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 Volunteer your time.\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 Be respectful of those around you and your environment.\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 Readily admit your mistakes and shortcomings.\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 Be real, be energetic, be positive, be brief and be gone.\par \par \uc2 We could call it the Humankind Club. The only requirement for membership could be a pledge to make more deposits in those around us than withdrawals.\par \par \uc2 Think of the impact we could have without ever opening our pocketbooks.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 Capital Journal, Pierre, July 22, 2014\par \par \uc2 Archaeologists should take a look at Ree Heights site\par \par \uc2 It's about three years ago now that ranchers Dean and Candice Lockner of Ree Heights found a layer of bones exposed in a slide area on property belonging to Candice's mother, Kay Fawcett.\par \par \uc2 Presumably they're bison bones; and possibly, given what we know about what took place just a few miles away along the same line of hills, they might be evidence of another bison kill site used by Plains Indians in prehistoric times. It's already known from another Ree Heights site excavated by archaeologists in the 1960s that prehistoric hunters, perhaps 500 years before Columbus, ran bison over the edge of those hills and then killed the wounded animals and processed the meat with stone tools.\par \par \uc2 Is that also what happened on the land the Lockners manage? Very possibly; but no one knows for sure because the Lockners have resisted the temptation to go poking into that hillside. They want professional archaeologists to do it so that the history won't be lost. They're even open to the idea that if it is another kill site, there might be potential for an educational exhibit or center of some kind, no matter if it's an inconvenience to their ranch operation.\par \par \uc2 "Even if you own the land, you don't own the history," Candice Lockner told us.\par \par \uc2 To us, that sounds like the kind of invitation the state of South Dakota and any university should welcome. So where are the archaeologists? Isn't this what they're trained to do? Let's get some boots on the ground, some experts who know how to excavate a site and how to interpret what they find. We know enough about the way people in South Dakota value their history to think there would be plenty of volunteers to help out with the digging.\par \par \uc2 And if this really is another bison kill site, then let's talk to the Lockners about that great idea they have of making an educational center to study and interpret the work of ancient hunters. It's history that is valuable in itself, but it's also economic development.\par \par \uc2 People will come from far away to learn what has happened here in our part of the Great Plains\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 Black Hills\uc2 Pioneer\uc2 , Spearfish, July 17, 2014\par \par \uc2 Unaccompanied Child Immigration coming to a town near you\par \par \uc2 Why are we allowing government representative and political pundits to use innocent children as pawns in the perpetual political blame game?\par \par \uc2 Desperate families from Central America are illegally sending children unaccompanied by parents to the southern U.S. border at a rate of more than 1,000 per day \u8212\'20\'14 roughly 55,000 children since October.\par \par \uc2 Citizens in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras live with the threat of drug-gang violence and even death on a daily basis. Human traffickers are preying on these poor, anguished people who are willing to do anything to help their children escape to the U.S. Wouldn't you?\par \par \uc2 This is not somebody else's problem, nor is it a partisan problem. This is an American problem. The time to act is now. Young lives are hanging in the balance.\par \par \uc2 The Homeland Security Act of 2002 and the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act in 2008 have set forth the process and protections for how the United States legally handles unaccompanied child immigrants, but it isn't very flexible. This lack of flexibility only exacerbates the problem the Obama administration and \uc2 Congress\uc2  in facing in deciding how to handle this issue with prudence and compassion without trampling important immigration laws.\par \par \uc2 Officials say it may take up to two years to process the unaccompanied, \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  children already in the country.\par \par \uc2 This delay is due in part to the overload the U.S. Border Patrol is dealing with. Not only are the agency's hands full dealing with adults trying to enter the country illegally, now they're tasked with trying to handle processing the huge migration of unaccompanied children, stretching their resources to the brink. We need to put additional manpower and money on this problem promptly. We need to find any family members these children have that are already in the U.S. and get these children placed as fast as possible. We are dealing with a refugee crisis on our southern border and it is our obligation as a country to care for these innocent children.\par \par \uc2 Recently, more than 200 unaccompanied immigrant children arrived in Nebraska to live with relatives or sponsors. This was all done without notice or coordination with the local or state government. Communication is not only a good idea it's imperative to solving this crisis. Government agencies, President Obama, and \uc2 Congress\uc2  cannot handle this alone, and they cannot handle this in silence. We must all work together openly. It will take federal, state, and local government agencies and non-profit organizations working in unison, and pooling resources, manpower, and knowledge openly to address the problem responsibly and appropriately.\par \par \uc2 We are a country of immigrants that was built through innovation. Let's show the world that we can handle a humanitarian crisis with a tough yet compassionate approach.\par \par \uc2 This is not a partisan issue; it's an American issue. We must act now.\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020140725ea7p001ry\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

ERDRICH   \par \uc2 Abilene Reporter-News\par \uc2 1,958 \uc2 words\par \uc2 24 July 2014\par 19:20\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2014.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 MCALLEN, Texas (AP) \u8212\'20\'14 When the truck lurched, Danny Sims knew it wasn't good.\par \par \uc2 In the rearview mirror he could see pieces from one his trailer's tires flying into the air. The car behind him swerved to avoid the trailer's fender, taken out by the blown tire. The spiraling piece of tin mashed itself against an eighteen-wheeler's grill farther back.\par \par \uc2 It was the first of two tires he would lose that night.\par \par \uc2 Sims pulled over. The trailer's side, painted with the Global Samaritan Resources logo, was now also marked with black streaks.\par \par \uc2 Sims is the executive director for Global Samaritan Resources. The trailer he was towing carried a full load of cots, used clothing and baby supplies, all of it bound for the Harvey Drive Church of Christ in McAllen. Their final use would be determined by faith-based groups responding to the recent surge of Central Americans crossing the U.S.-Mexican border illegally.\par \par \uc2 Despite the delay, there were still people at Harvey Drive waiting to greet Sims' group hours later. More than 20 people began stacking the cargo inside a backroom of the church's activity center. Later, Sims' group set up cots in another room, reserved for a Boy Scout troop, and bedded down for the night.\par \par \uc2 Over breakfast the next morning, Abel Alvarez, the church's minister, described the effect of the increase of immigrants crossing the border.\par \par \uc2 "I think three years ago, the (annual) numbers were 17,000 to 20,000," he told the Abilene Reporter-News ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://bit.ly/UoXRPH"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://bit.ly/UoXRPH}}}\uc2 ). "Right now they've processed over 50,000, and we're expecting maybe another 90,000 by the end of the year."\par \par \uc2 All that just since Oct. 1, 2013.\par \par \uc2 "It's mind-boggling," Alvarez said.\par \par \uc2 Most are women traveling with their children, but other children of varying ages are traveling solo. All of them come from the so-called Northern Triangle of Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.\par \par \uc2 "It's mostly Honduras. We haven't had anybody from Mexico," said Leticia Benavides, who oversees the project operations for Sacred Heart Catholic Church's immigration assistance center. She said the church became involved in early June.\par \par \uc2 "We estimated about 200 people every day for that first week," said Benavides.\par \par \uc2 Twice-daily buses filled with families released by the U.S. Border Patrol are dropped off at the church. But where the unaccompanied immigrant children are taken, no one seemed to know.\par \par \uc2 Alvarez said not having access to those children is becoming an issue with the faith community.\par \par \uc2 "They need pastoral care and we're asking to be let in," he said, adding they've so far had no luck.\par \par \uc2 At Sacred Heart, workers gather immigrants' information in case family members call looking for them. Then, the workers see to the immigrants' needs.\par \par \uc2 "They're fed, we provide them clean clothes, offer them a shower and have volunteer doctors who see them for minor things," said Benavides.\par \par \uc2 The church is two blocks from the bus station. Immigrants used to collect there, their tickets paid by family members, until overcrowding forced them out. That's when volunteers started taking them into their homes, and then Sacred Heart.\par \par \uc2 "We had a lady here from the center, we called her El Angel, because at one time she had nine families at her house," said Benavides.\par \par \uc2 Immigrants may only stay a few hours until they catch a bus to wherever they planned to travel. Those arriving later in the day spend the night, sleeping on cots in air-conditioned tents behind the church.\par \par \uc2 While Catholic Charities of the Rio Grande Valley is running the operation, all faiths are welcome to work in it. Alvarez has someone from his church there and several others are being trained.\par \par \uc2 "It's amazing, one of the highlights of this whole operation is the way we collaborate," Benavides said.\par \par \uc2 To pay for passage to the U.S., families raise money any way they can, including borrowing money from relatives or going into debt by arranging payment plans with guides who take immigrants part of the way to the border.\par \par \uc2 Climbing atop the infamous freight train known as La Bestia \u8212\'20\'14 The Beast \u8212\'20\'14 has been the most notorious way for immigrants crossing Mexico to the American border.\par \par \uc2 It's also known as The Death Train because so many have been maimed or killed boarding it. The train normally doesn't stop for the immigrants; those people must jump on a moving train.\par \par \uc2 On July 10, La Bestia derailed in the state of Oaxaca, stranding 1,300 immigrants. Heavy rain and overloading was blamed; it was the third immigrant train derailment in southern Mexico in a month.\par \par \uc2 Mexican authorities a few days later ruled, in the interest of safety, they were going to prohibit people from riding the trains. It may explain the lower immigrant numbers last week, Benavides said.\par \par \uc2 Immigration is a sore subject in America. Some label immigrants entering the country without documents as criminals, while others point to Emily Lazarus' 1883 poem inscribed under the Statue of Liberty welcoming "the homeless, tempest-tost (sic)."\par \par \uc2 But like any political problem, this one has many layers. The most visible, people crossing the border, is only the most obvious.\par \par \uc2 "The drug cartels have been able to collapse any kind of rule of law," Alvarez said. He pointed to the valley's bordering state of Tamaulipas and the Mexican government's ineffectiveness there.\par \par \uc2 "They don't run that state, the cartel does," he said. "So how can I fault some little country in Central America, who doesn't have 10 cents to rub together?"\par \par \uc2 Earlier this month, the commander for U.S. Southern Command, Marine Corps Gen. John Kelly, wrote in a column for Military Times that Northern Triangle drug cartels "have left near-broken societies in their wake." Money fueling the violence, he says, comes directly from the U.S. illicit drug trade.\par \par \uc2 Kelly cited \uc2 U.N\uc2 . statistics labeling Honduras as the world's most violent nation, with a rate of 90 murders for every 100,000 people. By contrast, recognized war zones, such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2012, rated 28 murders per 100,000.\par \par \uc2 "I know that the stories that we hear over and over again is, 'We're fleeing the violence,'" Benavides said. "We hear, 'Our neighbor's child was kidnapped, he was just 7 and was killed.'"\par \par \uc2 Alvarez echoed the same stories.\par \par \uc2 "Families are saying, 'Let's send whoever we can and get out of here,'" he said. He called it a humanitarian crisis with parents wanting their children to have a better life.\par \par \uc2 "Not a better life," he amended. "Just life."\par \par \uc2 But calling them refugees has not been welcomed. Alvarez has heard it from all quarters.\par \par \uc2 "Hey, we have laws for a reason, these people ought to go back," goes the argument.\par \par \uc2 "That resonates with me," he said. "But if I lived in a situation where I thought my kids were going to get murdered on the street, I'd do whatever I could to get them out of there."\par \par \uc2 He cited the chapter of Leviticus in the Bible as a guiding light.\par \par \uc2 "The last section is about being a good neighbor to the people around you." he said.\par \par \uc2 From his organization's perspective, Sims of Global Samaritan Resources said they operate outside politics.\par \par \uc2 "I still have so many questions, it's hard for me to be fully onboard with what's going on at the border," he said. "So I'm working to set those aside, to remain focused on the basic needs of those moms and their children, because that's in our reach."\par \par \uc2 Sims said his primary reason for coming to McAllen was to assess the situation and see where GSR could help. Bringing supplies was a bonus.\par \par \uc2 "Now I've got real contacts, I can say I've been there, and I know what to expect," he said. "I would feel really good about organizing a team to go and help, which they clearly need."\par \par \uc2 But how can Abilenians look past the politics of the situation? Alvarez had to confront that, too. He counts both Republicans and Democrats in his small church.\par \par \uc2 "And the Republicans, man, they're just ticked off at Obama," he said.\par \par \uc2 So Alvarez offered them an analogy.\par \par \uc2 "I wear a lot of hats \u8212\'20\'14 father, husband, board member," he said. "But that Christian hat? That sucker stays on the whole time."\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 Information from: Abilene Reporter-News, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.reporternews.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.reporternews.com}}}\par \par \uc2 ADVANCE FOR USE SUNDAY, JULY 27 - In this photo taken on Thursday, July 17, 2014, Abel Alvarez, right,  points out to Brian Gibbs the extent of the fence at the U.S.-Mexico border in Hidalgo, Texas.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) \u8212\'20\'14 The flood of children crossing the Mexican border illegally and without their parents has slowed down in recent weeks, two senior Obama administration officials said.\par \par \uc2 Border Patrol agents in the Rio Grande Valley in South Texas have found fewer than 500 children crossing the border illegally this week, the officials said Friday. Last month, agents arrested as many as 2,000 child immigrants a week.\par \par \uc2 The Obama administration has been struggling to deal with a flood of more than 57,000 children traveling alone since Oct. 1. Homeland Security Secretary \uc2 Jeh Johnson\uc2  said earlier this month that as many as 90,000 unaccompanied child immigrants could be apprehended by the end of the budget year in September. Most of the children are from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala.\par \par \uc2 The volume of child immigrants has significantly taxed resources at the Homeland Security and Health and Human Services departments in recent months and prompted President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  to ask \uc2 Congress\uc2  to approve an emergency $3.7 billion spending bill to deal with the situation he has called an "urgent humanitarian crisis."\par \par \uc2 The officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the latest trends in border arrests, said Friday it's too soon to know what has led to drop in border arrests. They said illegal border crossings along the Mexican border tend to slow during the summer.\par \par \uc2 Customs and Border Protection has launched a public relations campaign to warn would-be immigrants and their families in Central America that the trip to the U.S. border is dangerous and immigrant children will face deportation after they are apprehended. But since the trip through Mexico can take weeks or even months, recent border crossers are unlikely to have seen much of the campaign.\par \par \uc2 Obama is scheduled to host a White House meeting with the presidents of Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala next week to discuss the problem.\par \par \uc2 With a Civil Affairs policewoman standing between them, Dot Michael, left, 63, Dresher, a protester against the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  surge, and Ximena Flores, right, 25, Center City, a pro-immigrant proponent, exchange viewpoints in front of The Bourse Building Friday, July 18, 2014, in Philadelphia, Pa.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 CARTHAGE, Mo. (AP) \u8212\'20\'14 A Missouri family is elated over a \uc2 U.S. Supreme Court\uc2  decision not to hear an appeal on behalf of a Guatemalan woman whose infant son they adopted seven years ago.\par \par \uc2 Encarnacion Bail Romero wanted the high court to overturn an October ruling in which the Missouri Court of Appeals upheld the termination of her parental rights to the boy, now 7, and his adoption by Seth and Melinda Moser, of Carthage, the Joplin Globe ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://bit.ly/TCRVC2"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://bit.ly/TCRVC2}}}\uc2  ) reported.\par \par \uc2 On Monday, the \uc2 U.S. Supreme Court\uc2  said it wouldn't hear her appeal.\par \par \uc2 Melinda Moser said Jamison, the child she and her husband adopted before his first birthday, told them he was prepared to go to Washington and talk to the justices if it was necessary for him to be able to stay with the family.\par \par \uc2 "He calls it George Washington, D.C., but he said, 'Do I need to go to George Washington, D.C., and talk to them?'" she said.\par \par \uc2 The child has been the focus of legal battles since the Mosers adopted him in October 2008 in a process that started a year earlier. Lawyers acting on behalf of Romero challenged the adoption in late 2009, and the Missouri Court of Appeals overturned the adoption in July 2010.\par \par \uc2 In that ruling, the appeals court said the mother's rights had been violated because she was in the U.S. illegally.\par \par \uc2 The Mosers appealed to the Missouri Supreme Court, which ordered a new trial on the adoption. After that trial in Greene County, the judge in July 2012 terminated Romero's parental rights and approved the adoption.\par \par \uc2 The Missouri Court of Appeals \u8212\'20\'14 which had originally overturned the adoption \u8212\'20\'14 upheld the ruling in October in a unanimous 80-page decision.\par \par \uc2 Romero was arrested in May 2007 in an immigration raid while she was working at a Barry County poultry processing plant. She left the child with her brother, who turned him over to a sister, who then left the baby with a Carthage couple who agreed to the adoption by the Mosers.\par \par \uc2 Romero's parental rights were terminated because she abandoned the child and made no attempt to maintain contact or provide for the boy during the two years she was incarcerated.\par \par \uc2 Joplin attorney Bill Fleischaker, who volunteered with the team of lawyers representing the biological mother, said she did nothing wrong.\par \par \uc2 "She was held to a standard based on American culture and expectations, and we feel she was punished for being an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 ," he said.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 Information from: The Joplin (Mo.)

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) \u8212\'20\'14 The House amended a bill Thursday to include language that would help immigrants who are unlawfully in the country to receive their law licenses under certain conditions.\par \par \uc2 The decision comes a month after the state Supreme Court denied a license to a man because of his immigration status.\par \par \uc2 Jose Godinez-Samperio watched from the gallery as the House approved language to give the Supreme Court the ability to grant law licenses to immigrants here illegally under certain conditions. House Speaker Will Weatherford congratulated him after the bill (HB 755) passed.\par \par \uc2 "You've been given an opportunity by this Legislature ... an act of justice by this Legislature," said Weatherford, R-Wesley Chapel. "Return that act of justice to many others."\par \par \uc2 Godinez-Samperio's parents brought him to the United States on a tourist visa when he was 9 and the family remained in the country after the visas expired. He was an Eagle Scout and the valedictorian of his high school before graduating from \uc2 Florida State University\uc2 's law school. He passed the bar exam in 2011, but the Supreme Court said in March that Florida law didn't allow him to get a law license.\par \par \uc2 The court suggested the Legislature could pass a law to allow immigrants here illegally to obtain law licenses, and noted that Godinez-Samperio is an exemplary candidate.\par \par \uc2 The Senate approved language last week that would allow the court to issue law licenses to people in the country unlawfully if they came to the country as a minor and if they have been in Florida for more than 10 years. The House language added other conditions. Candidates would also have to have a Social Security number and authorization to work in the United States. Men seeking a license also would have to register for the military draft.\par \par \uc2 Godinez-Samperio meets all of those qualifications. The bill now goes back to the Senate with the new language. Gov. Scott said he will sign it if passed.\par \par \uc2 "I'm feeling great," Godinez-Samperio said. "Today is a great day for justice, for state's rights. Today is a great day for fairness."\par \par \uc2 Godinez-Samperio received a work permit in 2012 as part of President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which halted the deportation of immigrants brought to the United States as children. He is working as a paralegal at Gulf Coast Legal Services, which provides free legal help to low-income people in the Tampa Bay area.\par \par \uc2 He hopes to practice immigration law.\par \par \uc2 "Just as I needed somebody navigate the complex immigration system in this country ... hopefully in the future I will be able to help somebody else," he said.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 Follow Brendan Farrington on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 : {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://twitter.com/bsfarrington"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://twitter.com/bsfarrington}}}\par \par \uc2 Jose Godinez-Samperio, left, along with his counselor Sandy D'Alemberte listen to debate on a bill in the house that would allow him to practice law in Florida during session on Thursday, May 1, 2014, in Tallahassee, Fla. The House approved language to give the Supreme Court the ability to grant law licenses to immigrants here illegally under certain conditions.

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) \u8212\'20\'14 The Florida Senate on Thursday took the first step to help a Mexican national get his law license a month after the state Supreme Court said he couldn't because he's in the U.S. unlawfully.\par \par \uc2 After impassioned debate on both sides of the issue, the Senate amended a bill with language that would allow the Supreme Court to issue law licenses to people in the country unlawfully if they were brought to the country as a minor and if they've been in Florida for at least 10 years. Each case would be considered individually.\par \par \uc2 It's a response to the case of Jose Godinez-Samperio, whose parents brought him to the United States on a tourist visa when he was 9 and then remained in the country after it expired. He was an Eagle Scout and the valedictorian of his high school before graduating from \uc2 Florida State University\uc2 's law school. He passed the bar exam in 2011, but the Supreme Court said Florida law didn't allow him to get a law license.\par \par \uc2 The court suggested the Legislature could pass a law to allow immigrants here illegally to obtain law licenses, and noted that Godinez-Samperio is an exemplary candidate.\par \par \uc2 Senators debated for more than an hour over the issue before approving the language on a voice vote.\par \par \uc2 "Today was a great day for justice, for fairness, for states* rights," Godinez-Samperio told The Associated Press in an email late Thursday.\par \par \uc2 Some Republicans vehemently opposed the idea.\par \par \uc2 "Does being an American matter?" asked Aaron Bean, R-Jacksonville. "Congratulations on being an Eagle Scout, but you're not an American citizen."\par \par \uc2 Sen. Kelli Stargel, R-Lakeland argued that if the bill (SB 755) becomes law, terrorists could take advantage of it and become lawyers in Florida. She also said it could give death row inmates a reason to appeal their sentences if they're defended by a lawyer who wasn't in the country legally.\par \par \uc2 But other Republicans said children shouldn't be punished for the actions of their parents, and they were joined by Democrats in supporting the language suggested by Democratic Sen. \uc2 Darren Soto\uc2  of Orlando and Republican Sen. David Simmons of Altamonte Springs.\par \par \uc2 "We have the ability in our hands to right an injustice," Simmons said.\par \par \uc2 Godinez-Samperio received a work permit in 2012 as part of President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which halted the deportation of immigrants brought to the United States as children. He is working as a paralegal at Gulf Coast Legal Services, which provides free legal help to low-income people in the Tampa Bay area.\par \par \uc2 The Senate still has to vote on the bill as a whole and it would have to be passed by the House before going to Gov. Rick Scott, who last year vetoed a bill that would allow some young unauthorized immigrants to receive a temporary driver's license.\par \par \uc2 House Speaker Will Weatherford, who said he has met with Godinez-Samperio, said he was open to passing the legislation.\par \par \uc2 "There's some really compelling arguments to be made for that young man," Weatherford said.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 Reporter Gary Fineout contributed to this report.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 Follow Brendan Farrington on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 : {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://twitter.com/bsfarrington"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://twitter.com/bsfarrington}}}\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020140424ea4o002t9\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

Jacksonville officials had long been warned about the rotting tree, so they quickly reached a $3.5 million settlement with Stewart's parents to pay for his care and to make their home wheelchair accessible. But most of that money has never been paid as Florida Senate President Don Gaetz thinks the state's system for paying claims levied against government entities is broken and he is refusing to let even the most clear-cut cases move forward. Under Florida law, any claim over $200,000 against the state or a city, county, school district or other entity must be approved by the Legislature \u8212\'20\'14 even if the money would be paid by the local government or its insurance carrier. Gaetz thinks the so-called claims bill system relies too much on emotion, where claimants who are sympathetic figures or hire prominent lobbyists are more likely to succeed than others who might have more valid cases. The Panhandle Republican has refused to let Stewart's or 26 other claims bills be heard in the Senate during his two-year term as president, which will end later this year. By Kareem Copeland.

The Florida Senate on Friday voted 22-16 for a property insurance bill that could result in homeowners seeking coverage from Citizens to be shifted to a private surplus line insurance company. Surplus line companies are not subjected to the same regulations as companies based in the state. Several senators objected to the legislation, including Republicans who live in areas with heavy concentrations of customers with the state-created Citizens. Sen. David Simmons, R-Altamonte Springs, defended the bill and said it would give homeowners another choice for coverage. The Republican-led Legislature has taken steps the last few years to try to steer people away from Citizens. Citizens currently has slightly more than 938,000 policyholders. By Gary Fineout.

The House voted 74-44 on Friday for a measure that would stop elected officials and top employees in state government from enrolling in the state's traditional pension plan. The legislation would also automatically place newly hired public employees in an investment 401(k) plan if the employees failed to make a choice within eight months of starting their jobs. The measure would not take effect until July 2015. A similar proposal is moving in the Florida Senate, but it's unclear if the measure will pass.

Senators pushed through several late filed amendments to bring their bill in line with the House. The bill comes after the Department of Children and Families has been under intense scrutiny in the wake of dozens of child-abuse related deaths. By Kelli Kennedy. UPCOMING: 450 words.\par \par \uc2 XGR-ABORTION BILL\par \par \uc2 TALLAHASSEE \u8212\'20\'14 The Florida Legislature has approved a bill that requires a physician to determine the viability of a fetus to live outside the womb with standard medical care before performing an abortion. The legislation cleared the Florida Senate on a 24 to 15 vote Friday. It earlier passed through the Florida House of Representatives. The bill's supporters say the law could prevent abortions around the 20th week of pregnancy. Current law prohibits most abortions during the third trimester of pregnancy, or around 26 weeks. Advocates say the bill implements viability as determined by the \uc2 U.S. Supreme Court\uc2  in a 1992 ruling. Opponents of the measure have argued that a mother, not the government, should determine when to abort a baby. Scott has previously signed several anti-abortion measures. By Steve Miller.

A panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals scheduled oral arguments Friday for Quartavious Davis. He was sentenced to 162 years in prison as part of a violent armed robbery gang. Key evidence was records showing he was near cell towers close to the crimes. The \uc2 American Civil Liberties Union\uc2  says investigators should have to show probable cause of a crime and get a judge to issue a warrant before obtaining such personal information. Prosecutors in Davis' case got an order, but did not show probable cause. The Supreme Court in 2012 required warrants for tracking devices on suspects' vehicles. By Curt Anderson.

But now, those beaches are clean and Brown, the superintendent of Gulf Islands National Seashore, is celebrating the park's resiliency with a kayak trip from one end to the other. Community leaders and residents joined Brown for parts of his journey around the seashore that was marred after a BP oil platform exploded in April of 2010, causing millions of gallons of oil to flow into the Gulf. From nesting least terns to loggerhead turtles and blue crabs to flounder, Brown says wildlife along this stretch of white-sand beach is doing well. Still, experts say the spill's full impact on the nation's most-visited national seashore might never be known. By Melissa Nelson-Gabriel.

The Washington-based Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors was hosting 37 women at Destin's Emerald Grande this week.

A Chiquita attorney asked an 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel to dismiss the lawsuits at a Thursday hearing. A ruling is unlikely for months.\par \par \uc2 MIAMI COMMISSION VOTES 4-1 TO KEEP ULTRA FESTIVAL\par \par \uc2 Miami city commissioners have voted to keep the Ultra Music Festival. Officials had debated whether to halt the annual three-day festival in downtown Miami after a guard was seriously injured in March by gate-crashers. Festival organizers agreed to hire more police, install stronger fencing and set up drug and mental health stations. The commission voted 4-1 for Ultra. The head of Miami's police union had proposed that the festival should replace private security guards with city police officers.\par \par \uc2 ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT\uc2  COULD GET LAW LICENSE UNDER BILL\par \par \uc2 The Florida Senate approved bill language that could allow the state's Supreme Court to issue law licenses to illegal immigrants. The Senate amended a bill Thursday to insert the language. It's a response to a Supreme Court decision last month that said people in the country illegally can't be issued law licenses. The case involved Jose Godinez-Samperio, who was seeking his license after passing the bar in 2011.\par \par \uc2 TAMPA HOMICIDE DETECTIVE ON LEAVE\par \par \uc2 The federal criminal investigation of a Tampa police homicide detective has forced prosecutors and police officials to review cases in which he played a part. The Tampa Tribune reports that Tampa Police relieved Eric Houston of his investigative duties and placed him on administrative leave on April 3 after the investigation began. He worked on high-profile cases involving convicted cop killer Dontae Morris and Julie Schenecker, who is accused of killing her two teenage children.\par \par \uc2 FLORIDA DOCTOR FACES MORE THAN 200 COUNTS OF HEALTH CARE FRAUD\par \par \uc2 A Gainesville doctor surrendered this week after she was charged with more than 200 counts of health care fraud for allegedly charging the government full price for prescription drugs, even though she was giving patients cheaper drugs not approved by the Food and Drug Administration. U.S. Attorney's officials said Ona Colasante, 57, turned herself in Tuesday after being indicted by a grand jury.\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020140424ea4o001ng\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

She died in a Boston rehabilitation center, said Wong, who represented her in her immigration case.\par \par \uc2 Onyango, a half-sister of Obama's late father, moved from Kenya to the U.S. in 2000 and was denied asylum by an immigration judge in 2004. She remained in the country illegally, living in Boston public housing.\par \par \uc2 She finally was granted asylum in 2010 by a judge who said she could be in danger if she returned to Kenya because of her relationship with Obama.\par \par \uc2 Onyango was born in Kenya in May 1952 under a mango tree and was delivered by a midwife, Wong said. She raised a family in Kenya and worked in the computer department of Kenya Breweries, she said.\par \par \uc2 "She was an awesome, funny, shrewd, smart lady born at the wrong place at the wrong time," Wong said. "If she was only born in America or born in more Western open society instead of being bogged down by tribes, lineage and being a woman in Kenya, she could have been anything she wanted to be."\par \par \uc2 Wong said Onyango had become ill in January and died early Tuesday morning in her sleep.\par \par \uc2 The White House, which had no immediate reaction to Onyango's death on Tuesday, had said previously that Obama did not intervene in her immigration case.\par \par \uc2 Obama, in his memoir "Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance," affectionately referred to Onyango as Auntie Zeituni and described meeting her during his 1988 trip to Kenya. She helped care for his half-brothers and sister while living with his father, \uc2 Barack Obama Sr\uc2 ., in Kenya.\par \par \uc2 FILE - In this Tuesday, Nov. 24, 2009, file photo, President Barack Obama's aunt Zeituni Onyango speaks to The Associated Press during an interview in her home in Boston.

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc84}{\*\bkmkend toc84}\b \uc2 Recent editorials from Texas newspapers PC TEST\b0\par\par\uc2 By The Associated Press \par \uc2 2,143 \uc2 words\par \uc2 25 February 2014\par 13:01\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2014.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Corpus Christi Caller-Times. Feb. 23, 2014.\par \par \uc2 We're not electing Alamo defenders against Satan\par \par \uc2 If there's one question Texas voters should answer for themselves before casting ballots in the primary election, it's this:\par \par \uc2 Does Candidate (Fill In The Blank) really think we're that stupid?\par \par \uc2 A troubling pattern has emerged in several prominent campaigns \u8212\'20\'14 the message has nothing remotely to do with the job description. It's as if the candidate never bothered to read it.\par \par \uc2 Don't be fooled. The candidates know what the job is, but choose the message they think will make the biggest splash. Never mind whether it has anything to do with the job. Show them an opponent unwilling to sacrifice principle to play this game and they'll show you a loser.\par \par \uc2 Take, for example, the Republican primary for lieutenant governor, the most interesting of the statewide contests because it's a powerful position and there's not a single no-name among the four candidates. The lieutenant governor's job is to preside over the Texas Senate and appoint committees. Other than that, there's the occasional stand-in duty when the governor has left the state to go insult Californians to their faces.\par \par \uc2 The lieutenant governor is NOT the state's bulwark against illegal immigration. But a voter would never guess it from the ads and rhetoric. Candidate Dan Patrick claims to be the hardest-line of the four. The recent revelation that he employed undocumented immigrants in the 1980s notwithstanding, voters should have dismissed him already for bringing border security up in the first place. Ironically, the Dan Patrick described to The Dallas Morning News and Houston's \uc2 KTRK-TV\uc2  by a formerly undocumented former employee possesses redeeming human qualities we've never seen in the demagogic Dan Patrick portrayed by candidate Dan Patrick.\par \par \uc2 Another of the popular off-point campaign themes is gun rights. It's one thing for candidates for governor or the Legislature to talk gun policy. They actually can affect it. But it has managed to seep into the comptroller's race. The comptroller is the state's chief financial officer, accountant and collector and distributor of revenue \u8212\'20\'14 last we checked.\par \par \uc2 Maybe we should be impressed that comptroller candidates are courageous enough to collect taxes from a polite society of armed taxpayers. Candidate Glenn Hegar in particular has a video of himself at a gun range shooting a semi-automatic handgun and an AR-15 rifle. Knowing his way around Excel would seem more germane.\par \par \uc2 Hegar also wants the electorate to know that he's vehemently anti-abortion, as does Railroad Commission candidate Wayne Christian. It's pointed out often that the Railroad Commission has nothing to do with regulating railroads. It has even less to do with regulating abortion.\par \par \uc2 It used to be a traditional ruse by all candidates for attorney general to campaign on a lock-'em-up law-and-order platform when the attorney general's main purpose is to provide legal guidance and represent the state's legal interests. The law-and-order shtick was a lot more honest than what is going on nowadays.\par \par \uc2 The tendency is to blame far-right preening on the tea party for pushing already far-right Republicans farther right. It's true that a lot of pragmatic right-leaning politicians are playing this game as a survival tactic.\par \par \uc2 But the way we see it, the tea party is a group of voters who vote. That means voting in the primary, which a lot of so-called voters don't bother to do. The ones who DO bother will make many if not most or all of the key decisions in this election.\par \par \uc2 So, don't blame the tea party. Blame voters.\par \par \uc2 But don't let politicians off the hook. In each race there's at least one candidate trying his or her darnedest to discuss actual lieutenant-governing, comptroller-of-public-accounting, or land-, railroad- or agriculture-commissioning. Smart voters know what to do.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 Houston Chronicle. Feb. 21, 2014.\par \par \uc2 Patrick's kind act: In GOP race, hypocrisy is boundless\par \par \uc2 The lawyer's question had to do with defining the good life, and the teacher's answer included, in part, the admonition to love one's neighbor.\par \par \uc2 So, who is my neighbor? The prideful lawyer wanted to know. In response, the teacher told a story: A certain man was going down from Houston to the Rio Grande Valley to visit his ailing mother, who lived across the river in a foreign land. Coming back, he knew, would be dangerous, because he lacked appropriate papers. He ran the risk of being jailed, deported. By chance, two men of respectability were going down that way, but given the man's \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  status, both passed by on the other side. But a certain Houston bar owner \u8212\'20\'14 actually, the man's boss \u8212\'20\'14 was moved with compassion and offered to drive the man back to Houston if he made it back across the river. Now which of these three, the teacher asked, was a neighbor to him who needed help visiting his ailing mother?\par \par \uc2 Who could have guessed that three decades later, the "neighbor" would find himself pilloried by his political cohorts for his act of kindness? Or that he would deny it ever happened? Or that this Houston "good Samaritan" would be spending millions of dollars desperately trying to convince Republican primary voters that he would never, ever be guilty of acting kindly toward the undocumented among us.\par \par \uc2 State Sen. Dan Patrick, now in a hard-fought primary race for lieutenant governor, may or may not have helped out his undocumented employee. But what could be more unseemly \u8212\'20\'14 unneighborly \u8212\'20\'14 than Patrick's campaign strategy of scapegoating hardworking men and women like his former employee, now a naturalized U.S. citizen, as dangerous, disease-carrying aliens? Almost as odious is the effort by Patrick's opponents to lay him low by charging that he once acted compassionately. These self-professed godly men might remember that a certain teacher who told a similar story two millennia ago also had some pointed things to say about hypocrisy.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 San Antonio Express-News. Feb. 21, 2014.\par \par \uc2 Gone in Congress: art of the possible\par \par \uc2 Congress' dirty little secret on immigration reform: It's likely that a majority of House members want it because they know it's needed. But reform is dead this year and, possibly, the next.\par \par \uc2 Cynicism has replaced the art of the possible in Congress. Here's the calculation at work:\par \par \uc2 First, much of the GOP House caucus doesn't want immigration reform. But, combine those Republicans who do with nearly all of the Democratic caucus and you likely reach the majority needed to pass the legislation. This won't happen because of a rule that dictates that no legislation be allowed on the floor unless a majority of the GOP caucus wants it.\par \par \uc2 Got that? Majority votes are supposed to rule in Congress \u8212\'20\'14 unless the majority party makes sure that a majority vote never occurs. Another way of putting it is that a majority of the representatives of the American people want immigration reform, but they are being blocked by a majority of Republicans, who comprise a minority of the House.\par \par \uc2 The Senate minority party's version of this is using procedural maneuvers to prevent a majority vote, though tellingly not with immigration. The Senate has passed comprehensive reform that even many House Democrats would vote for.\par \par \uc2 Second, many GOP House members don't want a vote on immigration reform because they live in fear of a vocal, active base of voters who dominate their party's primary elections. Translated: Keeping what is likely a minority \u8212\'20\'14 but voting \u8212\'20\'14 portion of even their own party happy is key to re-election. And re-election is what these House members value most.\par \par \uc2 That's the dynamic at work on immigration reform. "Good" for some House members. Bad for the country. Cynical all around.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 The Dallas Morning News. Feb. 20, 2014.\par \par \uc2 Abbott's bad call on Ted Nugent\par \par \uc2 Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott seems to have a lock on the GOP primary for governor. Even in the lead-up to November's general election, his campaign could cruise to victory with minimal effort, since the steep uphill task of convincing skeptical Texas voters belongs to the likely Democratic nominee, state Sen. Wendy Davis.\par \par \uc2 Why, then, would Abbott take the reckless step of inviting an ultra-divisive American personality, hard-rock star Ted Nugent, to campaign with him this week in North Texas?\par \par \uc2 Abbott thought Nugent's vociferous Second Amendment advocacy would help burnish the candidate's gun-rights credentials. But Abbott and his campaign staff apparently didn't look into the more controversial aspects of Nugent's past, which should have given everyone reason to keep the candidate as far away from Nugent as possible.\par \par \uc2 This misstep calls Abbott's leadership and judgment into question and unnecessarily places his campaign on the defensive.\par \par \uc2 Nugent is about as crass as they get. He labeled President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  a "subhuman mongrel." He has referred to feminists and prominent female politicians as "fat pigs" and "dirty whores." He's acknowledged having affairs with underage girls, calling the experience "beautiful."\par \par \uc2 Nugent's background was outlined in a report Monday by Dallas Morning News staff writer Christy Hoppe. Abbott had plenty of time to cancel Nugent's appearance and minimize any damage, but he proceeded anyway. The candidate later said he didn't know about Nugent's past. At one event, Nugent was hustled away before reporters could ask him questions.\par \par \uc2 This isn't the first judgment lapse by Abbott. When a \uc2 Twitter\uc2  poster referred to Davis as an "idiot" and "retard Barbie" last summer, Abbott responded by thanking the man online.\par \par \uc2 When American Airlines announced merger plans with \uc2 U.S. Airways\uc2  last year, the attorney general joined a federal lawsuit to stop it on antitrust grounds. Then he announced a settlement with the airlines and pulled Texas out of the lawsuit.\par \par \uc2 Once again, Abbott is giving Texas voters reason to doubt him. Some might shrug off the Nugent debacle as bad advice by his campaign staff, but Abbott is the man in charge.\par \par \uc2 He badly miscalculated that Nugent's appearance would help focus this election on distinctions between him and Davis on gun rights, as if Texas voters care about nothing else. Conservatives and liberals alike put lots of stock in civility and respect for the dignity of girls and women. Nugent makes a mockery of those core values.\par \par \uc2 Davis calculates that women could constitute a swing vote in Texas, and her goal is to invigorate a large bloc of inactive voters who assume \u8212\'20\'14 wrongly, she hopes \u8212\'20\'14 that a Democratic gubernatorial candidate has no chance in this solidly red state. By proceeding with Nugent's appearance, Abbott just handed Davis an inexplicably generous campaign gift.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 Waco Tribune-Herald. Feb. 23, 2014.\par \par \uc2 State law means citizens need to think a bit more before heading out to vote\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights\uc2  Under Law is inviting anyone confused about the new Texas voter ID law to contact it with questions (1-866-687-8683). Some of the concerns it cites this election period:\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 As you might guess, women will again face greater likelihood of polling problems thanks to the requirement that the name on a voter's photo ID be "substantially similar" to the name on the voter's registration form \u8212\'20\'14 a potential oversight when some women change their names after getting married.\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 Elderly voters have reportedly faced difficulties in obtaining the required voter ID and have sometimes been forced to make several trips to the \uc2 Texas Department of Public Safety\uc2  to obtain acceptable photo IDs \u8212\'20\'14 a possible problem in itself if you have gone to our local DPS office. You can sometimes wait an hour or more to see a staffer.\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 Voter ID requirements might be applied inconsistently across the state, given confusion in protocol and changes in procedures. During the law's first run last fall, state Sen. Wendy Davis, state Attorney General Greg Abbott and former U.S. House Speaker \uc2 Jim Wright\uc2  of Fort Worth all reportedly encountered hurdles while trying to vote on proposed constitutional amendments \u8212\'20\'14 and few enough people vote on constitutional amendments as it is. (Well, did you vote?)\par \par \uc2 One might argue the extra expense to procure documents required to qualify for a state photo ID or the trouble of transportation to a DPS office, say, two counties over should be worth the precious right to vote. Then again, a poor man should not be troubled any more than a rich one when voting in America. Officials should watch this election closely with an eye toward improving our new voter photo ID law.\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020140225ea2p004au\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

Unlike the federal government, which can cut taxes without regard to spending, Nebraska requires a balanced state budget, which means weighing the value of government-financed services against the benefit of tax cuts.\par \par \uc2 In traditional fashion, some politicians proclaim that tax cuts for wealthy citizens and corporations will conjure up new jobs, although evidence that it works is hard to come by. Recently, Gov. Dave Heineman stepped around that challenge by saying that any job growth resulting from income tax cuts is worthwhile.\par \par \uc2 "Every time we can put even one person to work, I think it's helpful," Heineman told the Omaha World-Herald, in response to a question about a University of Nebraska Bureau of Business Research report released last week. The report recommended steps to "modernize" the state's tax system, including lowering the state's top income tax rate to below 6 percent. It estimated that the cuts would create 120 to 130 new jobs a year.\par \par \uc2 The same report also recommended taxing groceries.\par \par \uc2 With an eye on the state's $700 million cash reserves, which has swelled because of a rebounding economy, business groups want individual and corporate income tax rates cut. The Legislature is looking at a tax cut proposal, LB 1097, backed by the Omaha and Lincoln chambers of commerce.\par \par \uc2 The top income rate in Nebraska is 6.84 percent. If you're a single person making more than $27,000 a year, you're already paying at that rate, right alongside the state's millionaires. But tax-cut supporters note that's higher than the rate of any neighboring state except Iowa. They'd lower the rate to 5.9 percent after three years and have it kick in at $36,000 for an individual and $72,000 for a couple.\par \par \uc2 Once lawmakers got a look at the potential consequences, it didn't look like such a great idea. The estimated impact of the tax cuts came in at $645 million annually, about 16 percent of current state spending. That would lead to deep cuts in spending on public schools, higher education and social services, and shifting costs to cities and counties.\par \par \uc2 "The required annual budget cuts would be equivalent to the salaries of more than 11,000 teachers," said Renee Fry of the Lincoln-based Open Sky Policy Institute, which has done studies of its own that found no proof that income tax cuts spark economic growth. Fry said 61 percent of the tax cut benefits would go to the top 20 percent of income earners. The bottom 40 percent of wage earners would get 7 percent of the benefits. She didn't indicate whether that would be enough to cover grocery taxes, perhaps because that idea's a non-starter, too.\par \par \uc2 A couple of our neighboring states have no income tax at all. At one point Heineman suggested eliminating the income tax entirely and replacing it with revenue earned by eliminating a smorgasbord of exemptions from the state's sales tax. The same business groups blanched. What they had in mind was lower income taxes AND sales tax exemptions.\par \par \uc2 The fact is, Nebraskans pay high property taxes compared with the rest of America. When a Tax Modernization Committee went around the state asking for ideas about tax relief, members got an earful about that, said Sen. Galen Hadley of Kearney, chairman of the Tax Modernization Committee as well as the Revenue Committee.\par \par \uc2 "We did not hear from common citizens that they were paying too much income tax," he said, "but we did hear that they're paying too much in property taxes."\par \par \uc2 The state could ease that burden by picking up more of the tab for K-12 education. This week, the Appropriations Committee plans a hearing on raising the property tax credit to landowners, a direct way for the state to deliver property tax relief. Money for that won't be available if the state guts the cash reserve or lowers future income tax rates.\par \par \uc2 And for the record, tax cuts that require laying off hundreds or thousands of public sector workers, who are taxpayers (and voters) too, would be a lousy trade for a few dozen private sector jobs. Nebraskans, including those who won't see any relief from the income-tax schemes, still rely on them to staff offices that provide many government services.\par \par \uc2 That explains why lawmakers are eager to promise tax cuts but reluctant to cut programs until they know who will benefit and who'll be hurt.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Fremont Tribune. Feb. 15, 2014.\par \par \uc2 Time to get the 9,000 in the game\par \par \uc2 In the days after Tuesday's special election, there have been calls for healing.\par \par \uc2 It's true, a certain amount of healing needs to take place. The debate about the future of Fremont's \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  ordinance was highly emotional and passionate. At times, the rhetoric was mean-spirited and some of the most uncivil we've seen in quite some time. People don't forget those comments and move on easily.\par \par \uc2 However, we believe all those voices -- whether for or against the proposal to repeal the housing portions of the ordinance -- wanted what is best for Fremont's future.\par \par \uc2 But if Fremont is to grow, prosper and, yes, heal, it will take more than the 40 percent of the people who voted on Tuesday to take part. We must find a way to engage the approximately 9,000 people who did not vote.\par \par \uc2 Nine thousand.\par \par \uc2 That is a lot of people who are so disengaged that they did not even bother to vote in what some said was for the future of our city. The 9,000 represent a majority of registered voters and is more than everyone who voted on Tuesday. It seems they all said, "Who cares?"\par \par \uc2 Are the 9,000 happy with how things are going in Fremont? Are they so unhappy they don't think anything can be done? Are they so busy with work and life there is no time left for anything else?\par \par \uc2 We don't know the answers to those questions. We doubt there are many who do.\par \par \uc2 But we need to find a way to reach these 9,000 people.\par \par \uc2 Through its wide variety of civic organizations and governmental leadership, Fremont has been working to improve its recreational opportunities, its public infrastructure and other amenities in hopes of making this a better place to live, work and raise a family. We would argue that having a majority of the adult population engaged in the community would also make Fremont more attractive to potential residents.\par \par \uc2 It is time to find a way to get the 9,000 off the sidelines and actively involved in our community.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 McCook Daily Gazette. Feb. 13, 2014.\par \par \uc2 We're learning to live off the land once again\par \par \uc2 We live in a political world, where everything seems to come down to a question of left or right.\par \par \uc2 Even the most innocuous of subjects can deteriorate into a liberal vs. conservative debate -- the weather.\par \par \uc2 Mention "climate change," let alone "global warming" in these parts, and you'll likely touch off a heated discussion mentioning people like Obama, \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  and Al Gore.\par \par \uc2 Depending on your audience, you may hear about big oil, "tree huggers" or even "chemtrail" conspiracies.\par \par \uc2 But are "green," and politically, socially or fiscally conservative viewpoints necessarily in conflict?\par \par \uc2 We don't think so.\par \par \uc2 Take the aptly named Greensburg, Kansas.\par \par \uc2 We remember weatherman Dave Freeman of KSN TV in Wichita, Kansas, reacting when he heard the news of the town's destruction by an F5 tornado on May 4, 2007.\par \par \uc2 Even a veteran Kansas meteorologist was nearly speechless in face of the worst twister of the worst tornado season in 50 years.\par \par \uc2 "Oh, my."\par \par \uc2 Bob Dixson and his wife huddled in the basement while the rest of his home and all of their belongings were carried off in the storm.\par \par \uc2 Rather than despairing at the loss, Dixson was inspired to run for mayor and oversaw rebuilding of an entirely new town, including a new hospital and school with "sustainable" architecture, wind turbines and solar panels all over town.\par \par \uc2 He told NPR that he had to get past the idea that being "green" was a liberal principle.\par \par \uc2 "When we drilled down closer to it ... we realized our heritage and ancestors were based on those sustainable, green principles," he said. "If you take care of the land, it will take care of you."\par \par \uc2 That wouldn't be news to our ancestors who settled in Southwest Nebraska and Northwest Kansas. They used what they had, and, it usually wasn't something bought in the general store.\par \par \uc2 On the treeless plains, snug shelters built from strips of native sod plowed out the prairie served as housing for the earliest European settlers.\par \par \uc2 "Wind chargers" provided the earliest, direct-current electricity, stored in wet-cell batteries, and diets were strictly organic, grown in the garden out back or traded from the neighbors. Raw, unpasteurized milk and cream were consumed on the farm, or left on the station cart for a train on an actual "milk run" to collect.\par \par \uc2 Our region is playing an important role in the energy industry now -- both in traditional oil, and ethanol biofuel -- and there's no reason wind and solar can't come here in a big way in the near future.\par \par \uc2 If Toyota's hydrogen fuel-cell vehicle turns out to be a success, and other manufacturers follow suit, there's also no reason some of our alternative energy sources can't go toward hydrogen production.\par \par \uc2 The earliest inhabitants of Southwest Nebraska and Northwest Kansas knew how to live off the land. As we work our way through the 21st century, it's a lesson we're learning again.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 The Grand Island Independent. Feb. 16, 2014.\par \par \uc2 Grand Island makes strong case for LB935\par \par \uc2 The territorial dispute over the fate of the Grand Island Veterans Home took center stage before the Government, Military and Veterans Affairs Committee in the state Capitol on Thursday. As committee chairman Sen. \uc2 Bill Avery\uc2  spelled out the rules of decorum it was clear that he anticipated fireworks and a long afternoon as proponents and opponents of LB935 packed the gallery.\par \par \uc2 Although LB935 doesn't mention the words "Grand Island" or "veterans" the three-hour hearing mainly focused on Grand Island and veterans. Gov. Dave Heineman's decision to relocate the home to Kearney deeply polarized the neighboring cities. Strong opinions about the rightful place for the long-needed replacement facility have dominated conversations and headlines since last July.\par \par \uc2 The showdown in committee room 1507 was the first time the opposing sides have met face to face since the competition between Kearney and Grand Island surfaced in fall of 2012. Kearney officials secretly visited the Grand Island Veterans Home then to lay the groundwork for their bid. The problem with this visit was that it took place some seven months before the state Department of Health and Human Services released the official request for bids. Discussions between Kearney and state officials began long before that. To our knowledge, community leaders from Hastings and North Platte weren't afforded the same advance accommodation.\par \par \uc2 So much for setting the stage for a fair and open process.\par \par \uc2 Two key questions puzzled committee members. Why was the home being moved? Why wasn't the process conducted in the same open manner as the relocation of Nebraska State Fair?\par \par \uc2 Our Thursday editorial clearly outlined the flaws with a process that was devised to achieve a specific political end.\par \par \uc2 Veterans groups have also been caught up in this controversy. They have been forced to take sides and have been used to an extent as political pawns. It's unfortunate that the veterans who served a united nation are caught up in the politics of division.\par \par \uc2 Kearney Sen. Galen Hadley made an impassioned defense of the fairness and openness of the governor's process. His testimony included a particularly telling remark.\par \par \uc2 "I know for a fact if the scores for Kearney and Grand Island were close, Grand Island would have won." He then went on to point out all the ways Grand Island scored poorly and finished closer to last rather than first. Interesting how the scoring results ensured that Grand Island and Kearney weren't close. The ranking is even more surprising considering all the laudatory remarks that the governor has made about Grand Island over the prior eight years. What could have happened to drop Grand Island's stock so far in a year's time? This is a good question for the committee to ponder.\par \par \uc2 Also revealing was how John Hilgert, the director of Nebraska's Department of Veterans' Affairs, floundered to come up with coherent answers when asked to clarify how the categories for "workforce" and "culture" were scored. If the committee looks deeper into the process they will find much more to question the legitimacy of the survey. An examination of the timeline for early conversations about moving the home would be most revealing as would questions posed to all three of the site selection committee members on the specifics of the criteria and scoring. Grand Island officials asked for that opportunity and were stonewalled.\par \par \uc2 Key factors that would have gone in Grand Island's favor were purposely ignored in the scoring process and other negatives were manufactured by Hilgert and the site selection committee. No consideration was given for the proximity and usage of the Grand Island VA Medical Center. No value was considered for the 640 acres of land already given to the state of Nebraska for the home or for the hundreds of thousands of local dollars donated to the home over the years. A bogus demerit was given for the home site being in a flood plain -- a claim that was refuted by state and federal authorities.\par \par \uc2 We applaud Sen. Avery and the committee for asking probing questions. The hearing was an example that good government happens when the public is engaged. The truth has nowhere to hide in such proceedings.\par \par \uc2 We hope that Sen. Mike Gloor's bill will advance out of committee with the "look back" clause intact because the decision to move such a valued state service was made with bias, virtually no accountability, and a gaping lack of public process. While the governor has proven he doesn't always do the right thing, we trust that 49 representatives of the people working together will.\par \par \uc2 George Norris, the father of the Nebraska's unicameral government, offered these wise words regarding the importance of open government: "Every act of the legislature and every act of each individual must be transacted in the spotlight of publicity."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Kearney Hub. Feb. 15, 2014.\par \par \uc2 Facts easy to digest on vets home selection\par \par \uc2 The simple, easy route for the Government, Military and Veterans Affairs Committee would be to advance LB935 to the full Legislature, as its sponsor, Grand Island Sen. Mike Gloor would prefer, and allow the body of lawmakers to decide whether Grand Island ought to get a do-over on the veterans home.\par \par \uc2 That would be the simple, easy thing to do, but if members of the Government Committee take their responsibilities seriously, they'll do their homework and determine whether there really were serious flaws in the competitive process, as Gloor alleges, or whether there were sufficient checks and balances employed in Kearney's selection for the new Central Nebraska Veterans Home.\par \par \uc2 We believe the process was open and fair, and that all of the four competing cities, as well as members of the Legislature, were afforded multiple opportunities to review and comment on the process. The selection committee met several times with city representatives. All questions or concerns expressed by one city were shared with the others, along with answers to the questions and responses to the concerns.\par \par \uc2 It's easy to believe, then, that Grand Island Mayor \uc2 Jay Vavricek\uc2  added his signature, without reservation, to those of five other central Nebraska mayors on a March 25, 2013 letter to Gov. Dave Heineman in support of the competition. Later, the Legislature's Appropriation Committee approved criteria to evaluate proposals, and the full Legislature approved the state's $47 million share for the project with the full knowledge that several cities were competing.\par \par \uc2 These are easily understood facts the Government Committee must consider. A bit more challenging -- but still logical and understandable -- is the method by which the governor's three-person selection committee evaluated proposals to determine Kearney's bid was best, overall, with 1,033 out of a possible 1,300 points.\par \par \uc2 Kearney scored well in each category because the committee that prepared the proposal evaluated the city's strengths and vulnerabilities, and adjusted the proposal accordingly. For example, Kearney has occasional labor shortages, so the city's bid includes extra funding to help current veterans home staffers transition to Kearney. There's also money for medical training at UNK and the new UNMC allied health careers training center in Kearney to create a staffing pipeline.\par \par \uc2 Kearney prepared the strongest proposal because its leaders had gone through the meat grinder bidding for the $1.5 billion \uc2 Facebook\uc2  data center project. Ultimately, Altoona, Iowa, won over Kearney, but the grueling process left leaders with a clear view of Kearney's advantages and vulnerabilities, and so they meticulously addressed each category in the veterans home bid.\par \par \uc2 Kearney promised a very good site, offered reduced utility rates, drafted a plan to welcome veterans to town, and pledged $10 million to help the state reduce initial and long-term expenses.\par \par \uc2 When the Government Committee finishes its homework, it will clearly understand why veterans groups across the state are ready to build in Kearney. Lawmakers will agree it's time to do what's right for our veterans and move forward, without delay.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020140217ea2h003sf\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Scottsbluff Star-Herald. Feb. 16, 2014.\par \par \uc2 Tax cuts: Realities make them easier to promise than to deliver\par \par \uc2 Since nobody likes taxes, the obvious solution is to do away with them. The only obstacle to doing so immediately is, well ... it would be an economic disaster.\par \par \uc2 Politicians who clamor endlessly about taxes seem to forget that representative government is expected to get a few things done, such as building roads and educating children. Unlike the federal government, which can cut taxes without regard to spending, Nebraska requires a balanced state budget, which means weighing the value of government-financed services against the benefit of tax cuts.\par \par \uc2 In traditional fashion, some politicians proclaim that tax cuts for wealthy citizens and corporations will conjure up new jobs, although evidence that it works is hard to come by. Recently, Gov. Dave Heineman stepped around that challenge by saying that any job growth resulting from income tax cuts is worthwhile.\par \par \uc2 "Every time we can put even one person to work, I think it's helpful," Heineman told the Omaha World-Herald, in response to a question about a University of Nebraska Bureau of Business Research report released last week. The report recommended steps to "modernize" the state's tax system, including lowering the state's top income tax rate to below 6 percent. It estimated that the cuts would create 120 to 130 new jobs a year.\par \par \uc2 The same report also recommended taxing groceries.\par \par \uc2 With an eye on the state's $700 million cash reserves, which has swelled because of a rebounding economy, business groups want individual and corporate income tax rates cut. The Legislature is looking at a tax cut proposal, LB 1097, backed by the Omaha and Lincoln chambers of commerce.\par \par \uc2 The top income rate in Nebraska is 6.84 percent. If you're a single person making more than $27,000 a year, you're already paying at that rate, right alongside the state's millionaires. But tax-cut supporters note that's higher than the rate of any neighboring state except Iowa. They'd lower the rate to 5.9 percent after three years and have it kick in at $36,000 for an individual and $72,000 for a couple.\par \par \uc2 Once lawmakers got a look at the potential consequences, it didn't look like such a great idea. The estimated impact of the tax cuts came in at $645 million annually, about 16 percent of current state spending. That would lead to deep cuts in spending on public schools, higher education and social services, and shifting costs to cities and counties.\par \par \uc2 "The required annual budget cuts would be equivalent to the salaries of more than 11,000 teachers," said Renee Fry of the Lincoln-based Open Sky Policy Institute, which has done studies of its own that found no proof that income tax cuts spark economic growth. Fry said 61 percent of the tax cut benefits would go to the top 20 percent of income earners. The bottom 40 percent of wage earners would get 7 percent of the benefits. She didn't indicate whether that would be enough to cover grocery taxes, perhaps because that idea's a non-starter, too.\par \par \uc2 A couple of our neighboring states have no income tax at all. At one point Heineman suggested eliminating the income tax entirely and replacing it with revenue earned by eliminating a smorgasbord of exemptions from the state's sales tax. The same business groups blanched. What they had in mind was lower income taxes AND sales tax exemptions.\par \par \uc2 The fact is, Nebraskans pay high property taxes compared with the rest of America. When a Tax Modernization Committee went around the state asking for ideas about tax relief, members got an earful about that, said Sen. Galen Hadley of Kearney, chairman of the Tax Modernization Committee as well as the Revenue Committee.\par \par \uc2 "We did not hear from common citizens that they were paying too much income tax," he said, "but we did hear that they're paying too much in property taxes."\par \par \uc2 The state could ease that burden by picking up more of the tab for K-12 education. This week, the Appropriations Committee plans a hearing on raising the property tax credit to landowners, a direct way for the state to deliver property tax relief. Money for that won't be available if the state guts the cash reserve or lowers future income tax rates.\par \par \uc2 And for the record, tax cuts that require laying off hundreds or thousands of public sector workers, who are taxpayers (and voters) too, would be a lousy trade for a few dozen private sector jobs. Nebraskans, including those who won't see any relief from the income-tax schemes, still rely on them to staff offices that provide many government services.\par \par \uc2 That explains why lawmakers are eager to promise tax cuts but reluctant to cut programs until they know who will benefit and who'll be hurt.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 Fremont Tribune. Feb. 15, 2014.\par \par \uc2 Time to get the 9,000 in the game\par \par \uc2 In the days after Tuesday's special election, there have been calls for healing.\par \par \uc2 It's true, a certain amount of healing needs to take place. The debate about the future of Fremont's \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  ordinance was highly emotional and passionate. At times, the rhetoric was mean-spirited and some of the most uncivil we've seen in quite some time. People don't forget those comments and move on easily.\par \par \uc2 However, we believe all those voices \u8212\'20\'14 whether for or against the proposal to repeal the housing portions of the ordinance \u8212\'20\'14 wanted what is best for Fremont's future.\par \par \uc2 But if Fremont is to grow, prosper and, yes, heal, it will take more than the 40 percent of the people who voted on Tuesday to take part. We must find a way to engage the approximately 9,000 people who did not vote.\par \par \uc2 Nine thousand.\par \par \uc2 That is a lot of people who are so disengaged that they did not even bother to vote in what some said was for the future of our city. The 9,000 represent a majority of registered voters and is more than everyone who voted on Tuesday. It seems they all said, "Who cares?"\par \par \uc2 Are the 9,000 happy with how things are going in Fremont? Are they so unhappy they don't think anything can be done? Are they so busy with work and life there is no time left for anything else?\par \par \uc2 We don't know the answers to those questions. We doubt there are many who do.\par \par \uc2 But we need to find a way to reach these 9,000 people.\par \par \uc2 Through its wide variety of civic organizations and governmental leadership, Fremont has been working to improve its recreational opportunities, its public infrastructure and other amenities in hopes of making this a better place to live, work and raise a family. We would argue that having a majority of the adult population engaged in the community would also make Fremont more attractive to potential residents.\par \par \uc2 It is time to find a way to get the 9,000 off the sidelines and actively involved in our community.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 McCook Daily Gazette. Feb. 13, 2014.\par \par \uc2 We're learning to live off the land once again\par \par \uc2 We live in a political world, where everything seems to come down to a question of left or right.\par \par \uc2 Even the most innocuous of subjects can deteriorate into a liberal vs. conservative debate \u8212\'20\'14 the weather.\par \par \uc2 Mention "climate change," let alone "global warming" in these parts, and you'll likely touch off a heated discussion mentioning people like Obama, \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  and Al Gore.\par \par \uc2 Depending on your audience, you may hear about big oil, "tree huggers" or even "chemtrail" conspiracies.\par \par \uc2 But are "green," and politically, socially or fiscally conservative viewpoints necessarily in conflict?\par \par \uc2 We don't think so.\par \par \uc2 Take the aptly named Greensburg, Kansas.\par \par \uc2 We remember weatherman Dave Freeman of KSN TV in Wichita, Kansas, reacting when he heard the news of the town's destruction by an F5 tornado on May 4, 2007.\par \par \uc2 Even a veteran Kansas meteorologist was nearly speechless in face of the worst twister of the worst tornado season in 50 years.\par \par \uc2 "Oh, my."\par \par \uc2 Bob Dixson and his wife huddled in the basement while the rest of his home and all of their belongings were carried off in the storm.\par \par \uc2 Rather than despairing at the loss, Dixson was inspired to run for mayor and oversaw rebuilding of an entirely new town, including a new hospital and school with "sustainable" architecture, wind turbines and solar panels all over town.\par \par \uc2 He told NPR that he had to get past the idea that being "green" was a liberal principle.\par \par \uc2 "When we drilled down closer to it ... we realized our heritage and ancestors were based on those sustainable, green principles," he said. "If you take care of the land, it will take care of you."\par \par \uc2 That wouldn't be news to our ancestors who settled in Southwest Nebraska and Northwest Kansas. They used what they had, and, it usually wasn't something bought in the general store.\par \par \uc2 On the treeless plains, snug shelters built from strips of native sod plowed out the prairie served as housing for the earliest European settlers.\par \par \uc2 "Wind chargers" provided the earliest, direct-current electricity, stored in wet-cell batteries, and diets were strictly organic, grown in the garden out back or traded from the neighbors. Raw, unpasteurized milk and cream were consumed on the farm, or left on the station cart for a train on an actual "milk run" to collect.\par \par \uc2 Our region is playing an important role in the energy industry now \u8212\'20\'14 both in traditional oil, and ethanol biofuel \u8212\'20\'14 and there's no reason wind and solar can't come here in a big way in the near future.\par \par \uc2 If Toyota's hydrogen fuel-cell vehicle turns out to be a success, and other manufacturers follow suit, there's also no reason some of our alternative energy sources can't go toward hydrogen production.\par \par \uc2 The earliest inhabitants of Southwest Nebraska and Northwest Kansas knew how to live off the land. As we work our way through the 21st century, it's a lesson we're learning again.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 The Grand Island Independent. Feb. 16, 2014.\par \par \uc2 Grand Island makes strong case for LB935\par \par \uc2 The territorial dispute over the fate of the Grand Island Veterans Home took center stage before the Government, Military and Veterans Affairs Committee in the state Capitol on Thursday. As committee chairman Sen. \uc2 Bill Avery\uc2  spelled out the rules of decorum it was clear that he anticipated fireworks and a long afternoon as proponents and opponents of LB935 packed the gallery.\par \par \uc2 Although LB935 doesn't mention the words "Grand Island" or "veterans" the three-hour hearing mainly focused on Grand Island and veterans. Gov. Dave Heineman's decision to relocate the home to Kearney deeply polarized the neighboring cities. Strong opinions about the rightful place for the long-needed replacement facility have dominated conversations and headlines since last July.\par \par \uc2 The showdown in committee room 1507 was the first time the opposing sides have met face to face since the competition between Kearney and Grand Island surfaced in fall of 2012. Kearney officials secretly visited the Grand Island Veterans Home then to lay the groundwork for their bid. The problem with this visit was that it took place some seven months before the state Department of Health and Human Services released the official request for bids. Discussions between Kearney and state officials began long before that. To our knowledge, community leaders from Hastings and North Platte weren't afforded the same advance accommodation.\par \par \uc2 So much for setting the stage for a fair and open process.\par \par \uc2 Two key questions puzzled committee members. Why was the home being moved? Why wasn't the process conducted in the same open manner as the relocation of Nebraska State Fair?\par \par \uc2 Our Thursday editorial clearly outlined the flaws with a process that was devised to achieve a specific political end.\par \par \uc2 Veterans groups have also been caught up in this controversy. They have been forced to take sides and have been used to an extent as political pawns. It's unfortunate that the veterans who served a united nation are caught up in the politics of division.\par \par \uc2 Kearney Sen. Galen Hadley made an impassioned defense of the fairness and openness of the governor's process. His testimony included a particularly telling remark.\par \par \uc2 "I know for a fact if the scores for Kearney and Grand Island were close, Grand Island would have won." He then went on to point out all the ways Grand Island scored poorly and finished closer to last rather than first. Interesting how the scoring results ensured that Grand Island and Kearney weren't close. The ranking is even more surprising considering all the laudatory remarks that the governor has made about Grand Island over the prior eight years. What could have happened to drop Grand Island's stock so far in a year's time? This is a good question for the committee to ponder.\par \par \uc2 Also revealing was how John Hilgert, the director of Nebraska's Department of Veterans' Affairs, floundered to come up with coherent answers when asked to clarify how the categories for "workforce" and "culture" were scored. If the committee looks deeper into the process they will find much more to question the legitimacy of the survey. An examination of the timeline for early conversations about moving the home would be most revealing as would questions posed to all three of the site selection committee members on the specifics of the criteria and scoring. Grand Island officials asked for that opportunity and were stonewalled.\par \par \uc2 Key factors that would have gone in Grand Island's favor were purposely ignored in the scoring process and other negatives were manufactured by Hilgert and the site selection committee. No consideration was given for the proximity and usage of the Grand Island VA Medical Center. No value was considered for the 640 acres of land already given to the state of Nebraska for the home or for the hundreds of thousands of local dollars donated to the home over the years. A bogus demerit was given for the home site being in a flood plain \u8212\'20\'14 a claim that was refuted by state and federal authorities.\par \par \uc2 We applaud Sen. Avery and the committee for asking probing questions. The hearing was an example that good government happens when the public is engaged. The truth has nowhere to hide in such proceedings.\par \par \uc2 We hope that Sen. Mike Gloor's bill will advance out of committee with the "look back" clause intact because the decision to move such a valued state service was made with bias, virtually no accountability, and a gaping lack of public process. While the governor has proven he doesn't always do the right thing, we trust that 49 representatives of the people working together will.\par \par \uc2 George Norris, the father of the Nebraska's unicameral government, offered these wise words regarding the importance of open government: "Every act of the legislature and every act of each individual must be transacted in the spotlight of publicity."\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 Kearney Hub. Feb. 15, 2014.\par \par \uc2 Facts easy to digest on vets home selection\par \par \uc2 The simple, easy route for the Government, Military and Veterans Affairs Committee would be to advance LB935 to the full Legislature, as its sponsor, Grand Island Sen. Mike Gloor would prefer, and allow the body of lawmakers to decide whether Grand Island ought to get a do-over on the veterans home.\par \par \uc2 That would be the simple, easy thing to do, but if members of the Government Committee take their responsibilities seriously, they'll do their homework and determine whether there really were serious flaws in the competitive process, as Gloor alleges, or whether there were sufficient checks and balances employed in Kearney's selection for the new Central Nebraska Veterans Home.\par \par \uc2 We believe the process was open and fair, and that all of the four competing cities, as well as members of the Legislature, were afforded multiple opportunities to review and comment on the process. The selection committee met several times with city representatives. All questions or concerns expressed by one city were shared with the others, along with answers to the questions and responses to the concerns.\par \par \uc2 It's easy to believe, then, that Grand Island Mayor \uc2 Jay Vavricek\uc2  added his signature, without reservation, to those of five other central Nebraska mayors on a March 25, 2013 letter to Gov. Dave Heineman in support of the competition. Later, the Legislature's Appropriation Committee approved criteria to evaluate proposals, and the full Legislature approved the state's $47 million share for the project with the full knowledge that several cities were competing.\par \par \uc2 These are easily understood facts the Government Committee must consider. A bit more challenging \u8212\'20\'14 but still logical and understandable \u8212\'20\'14 is the method by which the governor's three-person selection committee evaluated proposals to determine Kearney's bid was best, overall, with 1,033 out of a possible 1,300 points.\par \par \uc2 Kearney scored well in each category because the committee that prepared the proposal evaluated the city's strengths and vulnerabilities, and adjusted the proposal accordingly. For example, Kearney has occasional labor shortages, so the city's bid includes extra funding to help current veterans home staffers transition to Kearney. There's also money for medical training at UNK and the new UNMC allied health careers training center in Kearney to create a staffing pipeline.\par \par \uc2 Kearney prepared the strongest proposal because its leaders had gone through the meat grinder bidding for the $1.5 billion \uc2 Facebook\uc2  data center project. Ultimately, Altoona, Iowa, won over Kearney, but the grueling process left leaders with a clear view of Kearney's advantages and vulnerabilities, and so they meticulously addressed each category in the veterans home bid.\par \par \uc2 Kearney promised a very good site, offered reduced utility rates, drafted a plan to welcome veterans to town, and pledged $10 million to help the state reduce initial and long-term expenses.\par \par \uc2 When the Government Committee finishes its homework, it will clearly understand why veterans groups across the state are ready to build in Kearney. Lawmakers will agree it's time to do what's right for our veterans and move forward, without delay.\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020140217ea2h003ra\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc87}{\*\bkmkend toc87}\b \uc2 Recent editorials published in Nebraska newspapers\b0\par\par\uc2 By The Associated Press   \par \uc2 1,923 \uc2 words\par \uc2 10 February 2014\par 10:01\par \uc2 Associated Press Newswires\par \uc2 APRS\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (c) 2014.  The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Kearney Hub. Feb. 8, 2014.\par \par \uc2 Legal path a challenge for aliens, economy\par \par \uc2 According to the \uc2 Kauffman Foundation\uc2 , 52 percent of Silicon Valley startups were "immigrant founded." The list includes \uc2 Google\uc2  and \uc2 Yahoo\uc2 , Intel and Instagram. That finding, along with scores of other studies and snapshots of the U.S. economy, shows that some immigrants are job makers, not job takers.\par \par \uc2 That fact is lost on many Americans who have tough stands on immigration, but don't acknowledge our problems involve two different groups.\par \par \uc2 One group \u8212\'20\'14 the 11 million people who are in the country illegally \u8212\'20\'14 gets most of the headlines. The illegals pose a more intractable and volatile problem, and what to do about them is a political hot potato, which was demonstrated this week as Republicans backed away from their willingness to pursue immigration reform with Democrats on Capitol Hill.\par \par \uc2 The second group of immigrants gets less attention. It's comprised of foreigners who have entered the United States legally and must contend with federal immigration rules that drag out an expensive and nerve-racking process to finally achieve citizenship.\par \par \uc2 President Obama once described the second group as "the folks who try to come here legally but have a hard time doing so." Republicans who are sheepish over the \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  issue should note that tending to legal immigration reform is far less contentious and reinforces the GOP's image as business friendly.\par \par \uc2 Although many studies tell us that immigrants are vital to the U.S. economy, a large number of Americans remain suspicious about all newcomers. Americans forget that one of their nation's strengths is its diversity. We ought to be welcoming immigrants, especially the scientists and researchers whose contributions can either help our nation create new jobs \u8212\'20\'14 or they can help create jobs in other nations because it's too hard to immigrate to the United States.\par \par \uc2 Ironically, brilliant young foreigners are earning degrees in engineering, computer science and other technological fields at U.S. universities, but because it is so challenging to become a U.S. citizen, they're taking their diplomas and their skills elsewhere. Countries like Canada, Germany and Austria are draining away the brain power we helped legal immigrants to acquire.\par \par \uc2 Those countries offer rapid residency and citizenship. They're taking advantage of U.S. inertia on immigration policy. What's worse, some U.S. corporations have no choice but to follow the talent and shift some of their operations overseas.\par \par \uc2 It's time to shrug off outdated attitudes and reform our policies, beginning with how we handle legal immigrants.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 The Grand Island Independent. Feb. 9, 2014.\par \par \uc2 Legislature to consider limits on executive orders\par \par \uc2 Sen. Mike Gloor's priority bill, LB935, if passed into law, would certainly put to rest a dark chapter in the storied history of the Grand Island Veterans Home. More importantly, LB935 would protect communities across the entire state of Nebraska from being materially harmed by an executive order issued by the governor.\par \par \uc2 The central issue concerns the economic justification and political motivation behind Gov. Dave Heineman's decision to initiate a process in which neighboring Nebraska communities were forced to compete against one another for a very large prize \u8212\'20\'14 namely, the Grand Island Veterans Home (GIVH).\par \par \uc2 Kearney, the supposed, and some would say "presupposed" winner in this contest, would become the site of a new veterans facility estimated to cost $121 million. The large initial investment would be accompanied by hundreds of new jobs and long term economic benefits that would stretch well beyond $2 billion over the 50-year minimum lifespan of the replacement facility.\par \par \uc2 One community's gain would be another's loss. Grand Island would lose a 127-year-old institution, a 640-acre community landmark, and, more importantly, a legacy of caring for generations of U.S. veterans that has been an integral part of the community almost from the time Grand Island planted its roots.\par \par \uc2 No consideration was given to the human and emotional toll that would result from the displacement of the GIVH's fragile, elderly residents or from disrupting and relocating the jobs of the home's dedicated staff.\par \par \uc2 As a matter of fact, there is no economic case to be made or requirement that the new GIVH be offered up for bid in the first place.\par \par \uc2 Sen. Gloor's bill, co-sponsored by Senators Kate Sullivan and Annette Dubas, would add layers of justification, accountability, and transparency by establishing a legislative process that would have final authority over the proposed relocation from one jurisdiction to another of any state service estimated to cost $15 million or more. Many other states including Kansas and Missouri have laws in place to serve as a check and balance against capricious, excessive, and politically-motivated largess manifested through executive order affecting state services.\par \par \uc2 LB935 has been set for hearing before the Government, Military and Veterans Affairs Committee on Thursday, Feb. 13, at 1:30 p.m. The importance of this law extends far beyond parochial interests or the controversy surrounding the governor's process. Language in LB935 does, however, make the law retroactive to Jan. 1, 2013, to allow vetting of any qualified relocation project for which all funding is not in place or conditionally approved upon the effective date of the law's enactment.\par \par \uc2 The essence of the bill provides footing for sound policy and necessary oversight for a serious vulnerability that could undermine another Nebraska community in the future and once again cause a permanent rift in relationships between good neighbors.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 Lincoln Journal Star. Feb. 7, 2014.\par \par \uc2 Wrong turn on texting\par \par \uc2 If Sen. \uc2 John Harms\uc2 ' bill to crack down on texting while driving makes it to the full Legislature \u8212\'20\'14 which appears uncertain \u8212\'20\'14 senators would launch into the wrong debate.\par \par \uc2 Researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee say a nationwide study they conducted suggests that in order for a ban against texting to be effective, it must be part of a ban against use of all handheld cellphones.\par \par \uc2 Only 12 states ban the use of all handheld devices.\par \par \uc2 In contrast, LB807 proposed by Harms would allow drivers to continue using cellphones while they are at the wheel. The bill would crack down on texting while driving by making it a primary offense, meaning that police could stop someone for texting without having another reason. The legislation would also make other driving violations a primary offense, including failure to use seat belts in the front and back seats.\par \par \uc2 Questioning by state senators at the public hearing on the bill focused on the difficulty police might have in deciding whom to pull over. Lancaster County Sheriff Terry Wagner said that if a driver told a deputy that he or she was dialing a cellphone \u8212\'20\'14 which is legal under state law \u8212\'20\'14 rather than texting, the deputy would have to let the driver go.\par \par \uc2 Left unaddressed by the legislation is texting by voice, when a driver might use voice commands to have a text message read, or to dictate and send a text message.\par \par \uc2 The first nationwide study of texting laws and fatalities, conducted by Wisconsin researchers Rahi Abouk and Scott Adams, showed that making texting while driving a primary offense has only a short-lived effect. In the first four months after the laws went into effect, fatalities dropped by about 8 percent. Then the fatality rate rebounded to previous levels.\par \par \uc2 There's little doubt that texting while driving is dangerous. Researchers at the National Safety Council say that, on average, drivers take their eyes off the road for 4.6 seconds to read a text message. At 55 miles an hour, a car will travel the length of a football field, plus ends zones.\par \par \uc2 At the same time, the nation's roads are far safer than they were in the pre-texting era. Thanks to safer cars, less tolerance for drunk driving, better highway design and other factors, the rate of traffic fatalities per 100 million miles plunged from 2.08 in 1990 to 1.14 in 2012.\par \par \uc2 The proposal in the Legislature increases the likelihood that innocent drivers will be stopped and possibly hauled into court, where they will be forced to defend themselves. Critics have also raised the possibility that making texting and failure to wear seat belts primary offenses will lead to more racial profiling.\par \par \uc2 The stories told by witnesses at the public hearing of death and injury caused by texting drivers were heart-rending.\par \par \uc2 If senators really want to reduce those tragedies, they may need to go further than LB807. To propose a total ban on handheld cellphones would probably touch off a firestorm. But if the safety advocates want to have a lasting impact on safety, that's the debate they need to start.\par \par \uc2 ___\par \par \uc2 McCook Daily Gazette. Feb. 6, 2014.\par \par \uc2 Drought causes unprecedented drop in groundwater levels\par \par \uc2 There's no such thing as a free lunch, and that also goes for the glass of water that comes with it.\par \par \uc2 Entities dealing with downstream demands for water have hit on a solution that may not really be a solution at all, judging by the 2013 Nebraska Statewide Groundwater Level Monitoring Report.\par \par \uc2 When Kansas demanded more Republican River water from Nebraska, and Colorado faced the same demands, one of the solutions they found was to convert groundwater into surface water, such as the Rock Creek project in the Upper Republican Natural Resources District, the N-CORPE project in the Middle Republican NRD and a similar project in Colorado.\par \par \uc2 By pumping water into the river, the agencies hoped to meet their responsibility under the Republican River Compact to deliver water to downstream users.\par \par \uc2 The problem is, groundwater is just as limited a commodity as is the water already flowing in the river.\par \par \uc2 The new groundwater report showed significant groundwater level declines throughout Nebraska.\par \par \uc2 From spring 2012 to spring 2013, every county in Nebraska, with the exception of Grant, Hooker and Thomas, experienced a water level decline greater than a foot. Some parts of Nebraska, including a spot in northern Perkins County, showed a one-year water decline of nearly 25 feet.\par \par \uc2 "That is unprecedented since we have been keeping records for water-level changes," said Aaron Young, groundwater resources coordinator at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.\par \par \uc2 "Almost the entire state \u8212\'20\'14 with the exception of a small area in the Sandhills \u8212\'20\'14 saw declines last year, and even then, I would suspect that in the next year or two, we're going to see some substantial groundwater level declines in the Sandhills as well."\par \par \uc2 On average, one had to go 2.54 feet farther down into wells before hitting water in spring 2013 than a year before, Young said, because of increased groundwater pumping and decreased recharge from precipitation.\par \par \uc2 "An average one-year decline of this magnitude has never been recorded before in the state," Young said.\par \par \uc2 Nebraska experienced the worst drought ever during 2012, 12-16 inches below normal precipitation in Nebraska, as well as the highest average temperatures.\par \par \uc2 "The extreme drought resulted in dry wells, municipal water shortages and water restrictions throughout the state," Young said.\par \par \uc2 If drought continues, as it shows every sign of doing, there is no way we can continue to pump water out of the ground at the current rate.\par \par \uc2 Whether it's for our personal use, swimming pools, lawns and gardens, or to support the agricultural endeavors that are vital to our Southwest Nebraska and Northwest Kansas economy, water is an irreplaceable ingredient that we must learn to use wisely.\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020140210ea2a0030u\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 LONDON (AP) \u8212\'20\'14 Britain's immigration minister has resigned over the illegal employment of a foreign cleaner, a major gaffe given the \uc2 U.K. government\uc2 's muscular clampdown on immigration of all kinds.\par \par \uc2 Cameron's Downing Street office said in a statement released Saturday afternoon that there was no indication that the minister, Mark Harper, knew the cleaner was working illegally but said the leader accepted the resignation "with regret." It also distributed Harper's resignation letter, in which he explained that he thought he had verified in 2007 that the unnamed cleaner's passport and documentation meant she could work in the U.K. legally.\par \par \uc2 But he said officials warned him Thursday that she was in fact in the country illegally, forcing his hand.\par \par \uc2 "Although I complied with the law at all times, I consider that as immigration minister, who is taking legislation through Parliament which will toughen up our immigration laws, I should hold myself to a higher standard than expected of others," he said in the letter.\par \par \uc2 The case has an echo of the U.S. "Nannygate" scandal, in which then-President Bill Clinton's top pick for attorney general was forced to withdraw her nomination in 1993 after it was revealed her family employed an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  as her maid.\par \par \uc2 But Harper's resignation is even more embarrassing because he was specifically tasked with policing Britain's shores, a hot-button issue in an island nation where many are weary of immigration.\par \par \uc2 Harper took a particularly aggressive approach to the job. His department oversaw the deployment of a van that patrolled London's streets warning migrants who had overstayed their visas to "go home or face arrest." The van, emblazoned with large handcuffs, was withdrawn following an outcry.\par \par \uc2 Harper also raised eyebrows after telling a repeat asylum seeker from Iraq that his multiple attempts to seek refuge in the U.K. were "ridiculous" and he should leave the country.\par \par \uc2 File photo dated Oct. 9 2009 of British Immigration minister Mark Harper who has quit Saturday Feb. 8, 2014 after it emerged his cleaner was in the UK illegally. The office of Britain's prime minister insisted there was no suggestion he knowingly employed an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Kosovo (AP) - A French court barred Tuesday the return to France of a Roma family including the teenage girl whose arrest in front of her schoolmates and expulsion to Kosovo became a cause celebre.\par \par \uc2 Leonarda Dibrani was detained in October as she got off a bus from a school trip, sparking rowdy protests in Paris and other cities.\par \par \uc2 A court in the eastern French city of Besancon threw out the family's request to return to France, ruling that their expulsion did not contradict the country's international commitments to respect family and children's rights. It noted Mr. Dibrani's "lack of prospects for economic and social assimilation in France" and Mrs. Dibrani's "lack ... of any assimilation into French society."\par \par \uc2 The girl, Leonarda Dibrani, received the news in the family's shelter house in Kosovo's town of Mitrovica. She said: "My future came to an end today."\par \par \uc2 "For me this is a nightmare," she said. "I have taken this very badly. I try to be courageous but inside it hurts."\par \par \uc2 In June, the regional administration had ordered the family to leave France and return to their father's native Kosovo. The family could appeal, but court spokeswoman Leila Azizi said it's unclear whether they will do so.\par \par \uc2 The teenager was detained in front of her classmates and expelled as an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 While such expulsions occur regularly as France tries to stem illegal immigration, the circumstances of the arrest -- in front of Leonarda's classmates and teachers -- shocked many.\par \par \uc2 Following pressure from the far left and members of his own party, Socialist President \uc2 Francois Hollande\uc2  invited Leonarda to return, but said the rest of the family could not come with her. She refused to return alone.\par \par \uc2 "We have been thrown away here like dogs," said Leonarda's mother, Dzemila Dibrani.\par \par \uc2 Leonarda Dibrani, and most of her siblings, were born in Italy but do not have Italian citizenship. The head of the family, Reshat Dibrani, admitted he lied in his asylum application when he said the entire family fled Kosovo, where they were persecuted for being Roma. The father is the only member of the family who is a Kosovo citizen.\par \par \uc2 The court said the regional administration should not be held accountable for the fact that the Dibranis were not actually Kosovar and had lived in Italy before coming to France, since the Dibranis didn't tell anyone that.\par \par \uc2 Kosovo authorities are currently supporting the family.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Angela Charlton in Paris contributed to this report\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020140128ea1s001mc\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 AUSTIN, Texas (AP) - When young Texas conservatives announced a "catch an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 " game, they expected condemnation from the left. But the surprise came when fellow Texas Republicans either denounced them or remained conspicuously silent.\par \par \uc2 Perhaps no incident better crystalizes how the state GOP is trying to mitigate its immigration policies to win Hispanic votes and keep the party vital. The dilemma couldn't have been clearer last week when several 2014 Republican candidates campaigned for votes in the Young Conservatives of Texas online straw poll while trying to distance themselves from the game sponsored by the group's \uc2 University of Texas at Austin\uc2  chapter.\par \par \uc2 The game -- which has been played at several other campuses across the country since at least 2005 -- rewards students for capturing one the group's members wearing a sign that reads "\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 ."\par \par \uc2 It was canceled Tuesday after university officials called it an honors code violation, but the publicity gave Democrats yet another opportunity to paint Republicans as uncouth on Hispanic issues.\par \par \uc2 "Out of one side of their mouths they say that they want the Hispanic community's vote, at the same time that they're begging for the endorsement of anti-immigrant extremists," said \uc2 Gilberto Hinojosa\uc2 , chairman of the Texas Democratic Party.\par \par \uc2 Among those in the GOP blasting the game was Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, whose gubernatorial campaign spokesman called it a "repugnant effort." Abbott did not actively campaign in the straw poll, but easily led it.\par \par \uc2 Bob Quasius, president of a Hispanic group called the Cafe Con Leche Republicans, said the group was being "stupid" by giving Democrats ammunition to define conservatism as anti-Hispanic.\par \par \uc2 "Many of us were young and foolish in our college days,'" he said in a statement. But he added: "How politicians and political groups talk about immigration has an outsized impact on perception from Latinos and Asians. "\par \par \uc2 William Hampton Williams II, who as a Young Republican at \uc2 New York University\uc2  supported a similar immigrant game in 2007, now manages \uc2 Eric Opiela\uc2 's campaign for Texas agriculture commissioner. In a statement to The Associated Press, he took a dim view of the game, which was also played at the University of North Texas in 2005, the \uc2 University of Michigan\uc2  and Michigan State in 2006 and the \uc2 University of Iowa\uc2  in 2007.\par \par \uc2 "Illegal immigration is a serious issue and the conservative argument wins on its own, and stunts and gimmicks like this detract from the debate," he said. "Clearly the kids were mistaken."\par \par \uc2 The Opiela campaign did not use social media to campaign for the straw poll, but was in the lead Friday.\par \par \uc2 Lorenzo Garcia, the chapter chairman for Young Conservatives of Texas, acknowledged the game was "over the top" but was meant only to spark a debate on a crucial national issue.\par \par \uc2 "I have been shocked at the uproar over the event's premise and at the personal attacks against me," Garcia said in a statement after canceling the game.\par \par \uc2 No single law divides conservatives and Hispanics quite like the federal DREAM Act, which provides a path to citizenship for college students whose parents brought them to the United States as children, and its Texas counterpart, which provides those students with in-state tuition. The laws have overwhelming support among Hispanics, including some Republicans in other states.\par \par \uc2 Houston Sen. Dan Patrick, in his campaign for lieutenant governor, has criticized his competitors for supporting the Texas law in the past, and some have backtracked to say they want to repeal it. Patrick remained silent on the game and actively campaigned for the straw poll on social media, as did Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson.\par \par \uc2 Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst condemned the game and has not campaigned for the straw poll, but neither does he support the in-state tuition provision.\par \par \uc2 Abbott "has said that the objective of the program is noble. But, he believes the law as structured is flawed and it must be reformed," his spokesman Avdiel Huerta told the AP without offering specifics.\par \par \uc2 Democrats, who won support from the majority of Hispanic voters in 2012, see an opportunity in the state's growing minority population to win their first statewide race in 20 years. They also see an opportunity in the Republicans' recent dilemma and will hammer on it through next November.\par \par \uc2 "There's a reason that disgusting illegal immigration game did not happen on the UT campus. ... It's because Texans reject what's wrong and stand up for what's right," said Christina Gomez, a coordinator with Battleground Texas, a PAC trying to increase Democratic voters. "If Greg Abbott and the GOP think we'll sit idly by as those around them dehumanize and humiliate the people of Texas -- they've got another thing coming."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Follow Chris Tomlinson on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  at: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://twitter.com/cltomlinson"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://twitter.com/cltomlinson}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020131123e9bn002f9\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 AUSTIN, Texas (AP) - A conservative student group at the University of Texas cancelled their "Catch an \uc2 Illegal Immigrant\uc2  Game" on Tuesday, saying they feared retaliation by campus officials and counter-protests that could endanger their volunteers.\par \par \uc2 In the event that had been planned for Wednesday, members of the Young Conservatives of Texas would have worn signs that said "\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 " and offered $25 gift cards to students who caught them and turned them in to the club.\par \par \uc2 Group chairman Lorenzo Garcia acknowledged the idea was "over the top" but said students should "not be silenced when they attempt to make their voices heard about an issue that is so important to our futures."\par \par \uc2 "I believed that our event would spark this discussion on campus," he said in a statement. "I hope that the publicity surrounding the event will create debate among students."\par \par \uc2 The Texas DREAM Act allows students who were brought to the United States illegally as children to pay in-state tuition at public universities, a provision many Republicans want to repeal. Such students sometimes rally in support of the federal DREAM Act that could provide them with a path to citizenship.\par \par \uc2 Several groups had planned to protest the game on Wednesday. The Librotraficantes, a Latino activist group in favor of a more open immigration policy, promised to hand out free "\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 " signs to students so they could collect the gift cards.\par \par \uc2 On Monday, \uc2 Gregory Vincent\uc2 , the university's vice president for diversity, had warned that students who participated in the game would be exercising their freedom of speech "to the detriment of others."\par \par \uc2 "The YCT is contributing to an environment of exclusion and disrespect among our students, faculty and staff by sending the message that certain students do not belong on our campus," Vincent said in a statement. "If the members of YCT carry out their plan ... they are willfully ignoring the honor code and contributing to the degradation of our campus culture."\par \par \uc2 University officials welcomed the club's decision to cancel the game.\par \par \uc2 This is not the first time the Young Conservatives of Texas has used controversial tactics. In September they held an "Affirmative Action Bake Sale" where they charged different prices for the same baked goods based on the buyer's ethnicity and gender.\par \par \uc2 Texas Democrats seized on Garcia's past employment on Republican Greg Abbott's gubernatorial campaign to criticize him for his views on immigration. But an Abbott spokesman denounced the game, calling it "repugnant" and said Garcia is no longer associated with the Abbott campaign.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Follow Chris Tomlinson on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://twitter.com/cltomlinson"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://twitter.com/cltomlinson}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020131119e9bj001f5\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 AUSTIN, Texas (AP) - A conservative student group announced Monday they will play a "Catch an \uc2 Illegal Immigrant\uc2  Game" this week on the \uc2 University of Texas at Austin\uc2 , drawing condemnation from Democrats and a threat of expulsion from campus officials.\par \par \uc2 The Young Conservatives of Texas have planned the game for Wednesday. Club members will wander the campus wearing signs that say "\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 ," and students who capture them and take them to the Young Conservatives' recruiting table will get $25 gift certificates.\par \par \uc2 "The purpose of this event is to spark a campus-wide discussion about the issue of illegal immigration, and how it affects our everyday lives," a statement posted by the group's spokesman, Lorenzo Garcia. The group did not immediately reply to several emails sent by The Associated Press.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Texas Democratic Party\uc2  pounced on the posting, condemning the game and pointing out that Garcia recently was a paid staffer with Republican Greg Abbott's gubernatorial campaign. The Democratic party has been pushing Abbott to state his position on a Texas law that allows children brought into the country illegally by their parents to receive in-state tuition, legislation called the Texas DREAM Act.\par \par \uc2 "While Abbott has said he doesn't support the DREAM Act as it is, he refuses to say what he would change and if he supports it at all," state Democratic chairman \uc2 Gilberto Hinojosa\uc2  said. "He must come out and immediately denounce Wednesday's event. This style of hatred and fear is not the type of leadership Texas deserves."\par \par \uc2 Abbott's Press Secretary, Avdiel Huerta, said the "campaign has no affiliation with this repugnant effort."\par \par \uc2 Many top Republican candidates have promised to repeal the Texas DREAM Act. Students affected by the law frequently stage protests on the Austin campus demanding changes to federal immigration law.\par \par \uc2 Gregory Vincent\uc2 , the university's vice president for diversity, said students who participate in the game Wednesday would be exercising their freedom of speech "to the detriment of others."\par \par \uc2 "The YCT is contributing to an environment of exclusion and disrespect among our students, faculty and staff by sending the message that certain students do not belong on our campus," Vincent said in a statement. "If the members of YCT carry out their plan ... they are willfully ignoring the honor code and contributing to the degradation of our campus culture."\par \par \uc2 Students found guilty of violating the honor code could face expulsion.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Follow Chris Tomlinson on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://twitter.com/cltomlinson"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://twitter.com/cltomlinson}}}\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020131118e9bi002hl\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

(AP) -- George Zimmerman was charged Monday with assault after deputies were called to the home where he lived with his girlfriend, who claimed he pointed a shotgun at her during an argument, authorities said.\par \par \uc2 Zimmerman pushed the woman out of the house and barricaded the door with furniture, Chief Deputy Dennis Lemma said at a news conference hours after the arrest. The girlfriend, Samantha Scheibe, provided deputies with a key to the home and they were able to push the door that had been barricaded.\par \par \uc2 Lemma says Zimmerman was compliant when deputies came to the house.\par \par \uc2 "The easiest way to describe it is rather passive. He's had the opportunity to encounter this before," he said.\par \par \uc2 Zimmerman was charged with aggravated assault with a weapon, battery and criminal mischief.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 City strips mayor of most powers as Ford knocks over councilor at chaotic meeting\par \par \uc2 TORONTO (AP) -- Toronto's City Council voted Monday to strip scandal-plagued Mayor Rob Ford of many of his powers following a heated debate in which he knocked over a female councilor.\par \par \uc2 Council members voted overwhelming to cut the 44-year-old Ford's office budget by 60 percent and allow mayoral staff to join the deputy mayor. Ford now effectively has no legislative power as he would no longer chair the executive committee.\par \par \uc2 Ford retains his title and ability to represent Toronto at official functions.\par \par \uc2 Ford called the effort a "coup d'etat" and vowed an "outright war" in the next election.\par \par \uc2 Toronto has been abuzz with the Ford melodrama since May, when news outlets reported that he had been caught on video smoking crack cocaine.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Better forecasts, more warnings and church services spared lives in rare late-season tornadoes\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON, Ill. (AP) -- When a cluster of violent thunderstorms began marching across the Midwest, forecasters were able to draw a bright line on a map showing where the worst of the weather would go.\par \par \uc2 Their uncannily accurate predictions -- combined with television and radio warnings, text-message alerts and storm sirens -- almost certainly saved lives as rare late-season tornadoes dropped out of a dark autumn sky. Although the storms howled through 12 states and flattened entire neighborhoods within a matter of minutes, the number of dead stood at just eight.\par \par \uc2 By Monday, another, more prosaic reason for the relatively low death toll also came to light: In the hardest-hit town, many families were in church.\par \par \uc2 "I don't think we had one church damaged," said Gary Manier, mayor of Washington, Ill., a community of 16,000 about 140 miles southwest of Chicago.\par \par \uc2 The tornado cut a path about an eighth of a mile wide from one side of Washington to the other and damaged or destroyed as many as 500 homes. The heavy weather also battered parts of Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa, Missouri, Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, West Virginia, Pennsylvania and western New York.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 AP PHOTOS: Storms leave swath of destruction\par \par \uc2 An unusually powerful late-season wave of thunderstorms brought damaging winds and tornadoes to 12 states: Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, West Virginia, Pennsylvania and western New York.\par \par \uc2 Illinois was the hardest hit, with at least six people killed and dozens more injured. Authorities said Monday that two other deaths occurred in Michigan.\par \par \uc2 Here is a gallery of images from the areas hit by tornadoes.\par \par \uc2 ----\par \par \uc2 Follow AP photographers and photo editors on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 : {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://apne.ws/15Oo6johttp://apne.ws/15Oo6jo"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://apne.ws/15Oo6johttp://apne.ws/15Oo6jo}}}\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Young Conservatives of Texas to stage 'catch an immigrant' game on \uc2 University of Texas\uc2  campus\par \par \uc2 AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- A conservative student group announced Monday they will play a "Catch an \uc2 Illegal Immigrant\uc2  Game" this week on the \uc2 University of Texas at Austin\uc2 , drawing condemnation from Democrats and a threat of expulsion from campus officials.\par \par \uc2 The Young Conservatives of Texas have planned the game for Wednesday. Club members will wander the campus wearing signs that say "\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 ," and students who capture them and take them to the Young Conservatives' recruiting table will get $25 gift certificates.\par \par \uc2 "The purpose of this event is to spark a campus-wide discussion about the issue of illegal immigration, and how it affects our everyday lives," a statement posted by the group's spokesman, Lorenzo Garcia. The group did not immediately reply to several emails sent by The Associated Press.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Texas Democratic Party\uc2  pounced on the posting, condemning the game and pointing out that Garcia recently was a paid staffer with Republican Greg Abbott's gubernatorial campaign. The Democratic party has been pushing Abbott to state his position on a Texas law that allows children brought into the country illegally by their parents to receive in-state tuition, legislation called the Texas DREAM Act.\par \par \uc2 "While Abbott has said he doesn't support the DREAM Act as it is, he refuses to say what he would change and if he supports it at all," state Democratic chairman \uc2 Gilberto Hinojosa\uc2  said. "He must come out and immediately denounce Wednesday's event. This style of hatred and fear is not the type of leadership Texas deserves."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Liz, Mary Cheney disagreement over same-sex marriage spills into public view\par \par \uc2 CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) -- Former Vice President Dick Cheney and his wife stepped into a sibling squabble Monday after their daughters became involved in a public feud over gay marriage that began on "Fox News Sunday" and soon spread to social media.\par \par \uc2 Discussing her \uc2 U.S. Senate\uc2  campaign on the talk show, Liz Cheney restated her support for the "traditional definition" of marriage. She added that states should be free to decide for themselves whether to allow or prohibit same-sex unions.\par \par \uc2 Her sister, Mary Cheney, who is married to a woman, shot back on \uc2 Facebook\uc2 : "You're just wrong."\par \par \uc2 Things got testy enough that their parents were compelled to address the matter.\par \par \uc2 "This is an issue we have dealt with privately for many years, and we are pained to see it become public," read a statement distributed by Dick and Lynne Cheney.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Video shows Russian plane hitting ground at near-vertical angle in crash that killed 50 people\par \par \uc2 KAZAN, Russia (AP) -- The grainy airport video is dark, short and chilling. Within five seconds, a dot of light that Russian authorities say is a \uc2 Boeing\uc2  737 appears in the sky over the tarmac and plunges to the ground in a near-vertical crash. The result is a blinding fireball.\par \par \uc2 The video shown Monday by Russian television stations -- {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.youtube.com/watch?vvgGHrMJuxRshttp://www.youtube.com/watch?vvgGHrMJuxRs"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://www.youtube.com/watch?vvgGHrMJuxRshttp://www.youtube.com/watch?vvgGHrMJuxRs}}}\uc2  -- of Sunday night's horrifying crash at Kazan airport that killed all 50 people onboard raises a host of questions, including why the plane's second attempt to land at night in good weather went so horribly wrong.\par \par \uc2 Russian investigators combed through the incinerated wreckage Monday after fire crews spent hours extinguishing the blaze. Experts from the NTSB, \uc2 Boeing\uc2  and the FAA were heading to the scene to help.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Boeing\uc2  737 belonging to \uc2 Tatarstan Airlines\uc2  was making its second attempt at a landing in Kazan, 720 kilometers (520 miles) east of Moscow, according to Alexander Poltinin, head of the local branch of Russia's Investigative Committee.\par \par \uc2 The traffic controller at the Kazan airport who contacted the plane before the crash said the crew told him they weren't ready to land as it was approaching but didn't specify the problem.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Democratic outside groups taking steps to promote a potential \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  2016 campaign\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) -- As \uc2 Hillary Rodham Clinton\uc2  privately weighs a second White House run, pieces of the Democratic establishment are beginning to fall into place publicly to help her possible candidacy.\par \par \uc2 Several super political action committees are collectively acting as an early de facto campaign organization to ensure Clinton is ready to compete vigorously if she decides to try again to become the first female president.\par \par \uc2 They're building a network without her direct consent. But she's not objecting either, and some Democrats are interpreting that as encouragement to push forward in anticipation of a campaign.\par \par \uc2 "There's a lot of energy out there and it would be a mistake not to channel and use it as an opportunity to organize," said Craig Smith, an adviser to Ready for Hillary.\par \par \uc2 The super PAC American Bridge 21st Century has launched Correct the Record, a group staffed by former Clinton aides who intend to defend the former secretary of state and other potential 2016 candidates against Republican critics. Priorities USA Action, which ran searing ads against rivals of President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  to support his re-election, is discussing bringing onboard a former White House chief of staff under her husband.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 In perilous nighttime trek, Syrians flee government offensive to find refuge in Lebanon\par \par \uc2 ARSAL, Lebanon (AP) -- The two sisters squeezed the hands of their blind grandfather for nearly seven hours as they made the perilous nighttime trek by foot along rugged mountain roads subjected to sporadic shelling before finally crossing the Syrian border to safety in Lebanon.\par \par \uc2 Mehrez Humeidan and his granddaughters Ikram and Inaam were among at least 6,000 Syrians that the United Nations says have poured into Lebanon over the past three days. The refugees are escaping a government offensive that began Friday and aims to dislodge rebels from the mountainous Qalamoun region, which runs north from Damascus along the frontier.\par \par \uc2 Qalamoun holds strategic value for both sides in Syria's civil war. It serves as a key supply route from Lebanon to opposition forces around Damascus, and it is home to the main north-south highway that links the capital to government strongholds along the Mediterranean coast.\par \par \uc2 The offensive is part of a broader government push that has seen Assad's forces seize the momentum in the civil war, capturing a string of opposition-held suburbs south of Damascus as well as two towns and a military base around the northern city of Aleppo.\par \par \uc2 The battlefield gains have strengthened the government's hand as the world community pushes for peace talks in Geneva.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Investors remain confident stocks can keep rallying, although the rise could slow in 2014\par \par \uc2 NEW YORK (AP) -- Is the stock market due for a pullback?\par \par \uc2 The Dow Jones industrial average has surged 900 points since early October and crossed the 16,000-point threshold Monday. IPOs are hot again. Small investors, stirred from their post-recession daze, are coming back to stocks. And it's been more than two years since the market has had a significant slump.\par \par \uc2 Those trends have raised concerns of a stock bubble. They shouldn't, money managers say, because even with the broader market's 26 percent jump this year, stocks aren't overpriced yet.\par \par \uc2 "Stocks are not cheap, but that does not mean that the stock market is expensive," says \uc2 Russ Koesterich\uc2 , chief investment strategist with Blackrock.\par \par \uc2 The ratio of stock prices to projected profits for companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 index is 15, according to data from FactSet. That's slightly below the average of 16.2 over the last 15 years and far below the peak of 25 in late 1990s and early 2000s.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020131118e9bi0008d\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

(AP) -- George Zimmerman was charged Monday with assault after deputies were called to the home where he lived with his girlfriend, who claimed he pointed a shotgun at her during an argument, authorities said. Zimmerman pushed the woman out of the house and barricaded the door with furniture, Chief Deputy Dennis Lemma said at a news conference hours after the arrest. The girlfriend, Samantha Scheibe, provided deputies with a key to the home and they were able to push the door that had been barricaded.\par \par \uc2 Toronto council strips mayor of most powers\par \par \uc2 TORONTO (AP) -- Toronto's City Council voted Monday to strip scandal-plagued Mayor Rob Ford of many of his powers following a heated debate in which he knocked over a female councilor. Council members voted overwhelming to cut the 44-year-old Ford's office budget by 60 percent and allow mayoral staff to join the deputy mayor. Ford now effectively has no legislative power as he would no longer chair the executive committee.\par \par \uc2 Day after storm, NFL determined to put fans first\par \par \uc2 CHICAGO (AP) -- As powerful as fans and even rival sports leagues believe it to be, even the NFL can't do anything about the weather. Yet some 24 hours after the \uc2 Chicago Bears\uc2  closed out a dangerous afternoon at Soldier Field in light rain with a 23-20 overtime win against visiting Baltimore, more than a few people in the Windy City were still shaking their heads. And not just because of dropping temperatures and still-gusting winds that lingered across the Chicago area Monday -- remnants of a late-season storm that spawned tornadoes and slammed the Midwest a day earlier, leaving six dead and dozens injured downstate.\par \par \uc2 AP PHOTOS: Storms leave swath of destruction\par \par \uc2 An unusually powerful late-season wave of thunderstorms brought damaging winds and tornadoes to 12 states: Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, West Virginia, Pennsylvania and western New York. Illinois was the hardest hit, with at least six people killed and dozens more injured. Authorities said Monday that two other deaths occurred in Michigan.\par \par \uc2 Outside political groups coalescing around Clinton\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON (AP) -- As \uc2 Hillary Rodham Clinton\uc2  privately weighs a second White House run, pieces of the Democratic establishment are beginning to fall into place publicly to help her possible candidacy. Several super political action committees are collectively acting as an early de facto campaign organization to ensure Clinton is ready to compete vigorously if she decides to try again to become the first female president.\par \par \uc2 Cheney sisters spar on same-sex marriage\par \par \uc2 CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) -- Former Vice President Dick Cheney and his wife stepped into a sibling squabble Monday after their daughters became involved in a public feud over gay marriage that began on "Fox News Sunday" and soon spread to social media. Discussing her \uc2 U.S. Senate\uc2  campaign on the talk show, Liz Cheney restated her support for the "traditional definition" of marriage. She added that states should be free to decide for themselves whether to allow or prohibit same-sex unions.\par \par \uc2 Video shows near-vertical crash of Russian plane\par \par \uc2 KAZAN, Russia (AP) -- The grainy airport video is dark, short and chilling. Within five seconds, a dot of light that Russian authorities say is a \uc2 Boeing\uc2  737 appears in the sky over the tarmac and plunges to the ground in a near-vertical crash. The result is a blinding fireball.

The Dow Jones industrial average has surged 900 points since early October and crossed the 16,000-point threshold Monday. IPOs are hot again. Small investors, stirred from their post-recession daze, are coming back to stocks. And it's been more than two years since the market has had a significant slump.\par \par \uc2 NASA launches robotic explorer to Mars\par \par \uc2 CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.

The Maven spacecraft is due at Mars next fall following a journey of more than 440 million miles.\par \par \uc2 Conservative students to stage 'immigrant game'\par \par \uc2 AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- A conservative student group announced Monday they will play a "Catch an \uc2 Illegal Immigrant\uc2  Game" this week on the \uc2 University of Texas at Austin\uc2 , drawing condemnation from Democrats and a threat of expulsion from campus officials. The Young Conservatives of Texas have planned the game for Wednesday. Club members will wander the campus wearing signs that say "\uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2 ," and students who capture them and take them to the Young Conservatives' recruiting table will get $25 gift certificates.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020131118e9bi0000p\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PARIS (AP) - Under fire from the far left and members of his own party, Socialist President \uc2 Francois Hollande\uc2  said Saturday that a 15-year-old girl who was detained in front of her classmates and expelled as an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  can return to France. But the rest of the family cannot come with her.\par \par \uc2 Leonarda Dibrani, however, said she would not return without her family, who are Roma, or Gypsies.\par \par \uc2 The deportation of the Dibrani family, whose requests for asylum were rejected, has lit a firestorm in France, where such expulsions aren't rare but are always sensitive as the birthplace of the "rights of man" grapples with a flux of immigrants. It's an especially delicate issue for Hollande and the Socialists, who have tried to present a softer image of France's immigration policies and distance themselves from former \uc2 Nicolas Sarkozy\uc2 's tough stance.\par \par \uc2 The uproar began earlier this week when it became public that 15-year-old Leonarda was detained by police as she got off a bus from a school trip. Schools are considered places of sanctuary, and many thought that principle had been breached. The case has also opened a wider debate on France's immigration policies.\par \par \uc2 The story has since become more complicated, with the father admitting that he lied in his asylum application when he said the entire family fled Kosovo, where they were persecuted for being Roma. Leonarda, and most of her siblings, were born in Italy, though they do not have Italian citizenship.\par \par \uc2 A government report published Saturday found that the police followed the law, although the report said they didn't seem to realize the sensitivity of what they were doing.\par \par \uc2 Apparently fearing that conclusion wouldn't put the issue to rest, Hollande went on national television Saturday to walk the line between maintaining a tough stance on illegal immigrants and showing compassion for girl caught up in the storm.\par \par \uc2 He said Leonarda, considering the circumstances of her detention, could come back to France to go to school, if she wishes. But only she can come back. In Mitrovica, Kosovo, where the family is now living, Leonarda told reporters she would not come back without her family.\par \par \uc2 "Mr. Hollande has no heart for my family? He has no pity?" Leonarda asked, in an emotional scene in front of cameras.\par \par \uc2 Her father has threatened to return to France illegally and even said the family had already packed their bags.\par \par \uc2 "We thought that Hollande was a just person to protect a family," said Leonarda's mother, Dzemila Dibrani. "To give him my daughter, that is not possible."\par \par \uc2 Hollande also said local authorities would be told that such detentions cannot happen while children are in the care of their schools, whether inside the building, at the exit, on a bus or in after-school activities.\par \par \uc2 Although polls show that the majority of French people don't think the family should be allowed to return to France, the case has threatened to destabilize the Hollande government.\par \par \uc2 On Thursday and Friday, thousands of teenagers protested the expulsion, and students gathered again Saturday on the steps of the Opera house at Place de la Bastille. They are calling for French law to be changed so minors who are in school cannot be expelled, and their families can remain, too.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Qena reported from Mitrovica, Kosovo.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020131019e9aj00231\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The Hays Daily News, Sept. 13\par \par \uc2 Kansas children in poverty:\par \par \uc2 When Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback was still running for the office, he unveiled the Roadmap for Kansas. The five-part plan was ambitious and, in the governor's words, measurable.\par \par \uc2 One of the Roadmap's goals was decreasing the number of children living in poverty. Despite being a critical need in this state with almost 20 percent of young Kansans meeting the criteria, it was basically unprecedented.\par \par \uc2 "The day I saw his Road Map, I said, `Wow, who let him put that in there?'" \uc2 Shannon Cotsoradis\uc2 , president of Kansas \uc2 Action for Children\uc2 , said at the time.\par \par \uc2 The Governor's Task Force on Reducing Childhood Poverty finally was created in November 2012, with the charge of "finding innovative and ground-breaking ways to reduce childhood poverty and improve child outcomes in Kansas."\par \par \uc2 Our optimism for this group to accomplish anything was diminished significantly because of a series of actions taken by Brownback and the Legislature in the past three years.\par \par \uc2 The governor's first budget proposed eliminating Early Head Start. That plan eventually was taken off the table, but many other tactics bound to increase childhood poverty made their way into law. During the massive tax overhaul, a child and dependent tax credit was eliminated that was utilized by 60,000 low- and middle-income families. Also deleted was a food sales tax rebate designed for poor families, and the homestead property tax refund for low-income renters.\par \par \uc2 The number of Kansans receiving Temporary Aid to Needy Families has almost been cut in half, not because their needs decreased but because the rules became more onerous and difficult to abide by.\par \par \uc2 The state sales tax, which was scheduled to decrease to 5.7 percent last July, instead was boosted to 6.1 percent. Sales taxes are inherently regressive, and even an effort to exempt food purchases from sales tax was rejected.\par \par \uc2 Individual welfare recipients were made subject to drug testing, although the much larger corporate welfare recipients were not. Some 240,000 low-income Kansans who could have come under Medicaid coverage through the Affordable Care Act will not because the governor refused to expand the program. Some 2,200 kids living in households that receive a portion of their income from an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  lost access to the food stamp program. Just last week, the state decided not to renew an offered federal waiver that allows 20,000 unemployed Kansans to obtain food assistance. Finally, lawmakers are still working on reducing the Earned Income Tax Credit, which puts a few hundred extra dollars into the budgets of 200,000 poor residents.\par \par \uc2 "It is amazingly curious to people who work in the anti-poverty arena on a day-to-day basis," said Tawny Stottlemire, executive director of the Kansas Association of Community Action Programs. "The policy discussions are disconnected with the governor's policy objective. This administration seems to want to decrease poverty by making it harder to live in poverty -- not by assisting people."\par \par \uc2 Still, the governor promised something measurable to help decrease poverty for the state's children. We scoured the task force's 27-page report it released last week for something tangible. Not surprisingly, there was little substance to be found.\par \par \uc2 Of the 27 pages, six pages were dedicated to listing the biographies of the panel -- twice. Four pages were for the bios of the presenters. Ten pages were either title pages or meeting agendas and announcements. Take off the one-page executive summary, and suddenly the impressive-sounding 27-page report on this important issue was reduced to six pages.\par \par \uc2 Phyllis Gilmore, secretary of the Kansas Department for Children and Families and chair of the task force, admitted the group didn't agree on any specific reforms. In fact, there wasn't a single vote taken by the 12-member panel. But they did assemble some recommendations in three key areas: education, employment and family composition.\par \par \uc2 As explained by a Kansas Health Institute report, the recommendations include:\par \par \uc2 -- Expand job training and technical education programs;\par \par \uc2 -- Find mentors for at-risk children;\par \par \uc2 -- Improve fourth grade reading scores;\par \par \uc2 -- Promote employment over dependence on government-funded programs;\par \par \uc2 -- Launch a public relations campaign to stress the importance of marriage and fatherhood;\par \par \uc2 -- Expand middle school and high school classes on healthy relationships;\par \par \uc2 -- Reduce or eliminate marriage license fees for couples that complete an eight-hour course on healthy relationships.\par \par \uc2 "I'd say it's a good summary of what we already know," said Betsy Cauble, a social welfare professor at \uc2 Kansas State University\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "There's nothing in here on early childhood development, which research has shown to be the most critical window for combating the effects of poverty -- that's the most glaring omission," said KAC Director Cotsoradis. "There's also no mention of shoring up the social safety-net programs that are keeping thousands of families together. There's nothing in these recommendations that's going to produce near-term results. That's unfortunate because these kids are in poverty now."\par \par \uc2 In short, there was nothing innovative or groundbreaking in the task force's report. Most of the recommendations either were lifted directly from Brownback's Roadmap, or were actions already taken by the Legislature.\par \par \uc2 The state will need a different approach if childhood poverty ever is to be reduced. The only thing measurable about the task force's report is the number of pages legislators undoubtedly will be reading when they convene in January. In the meantime, expect the poverty rate to keep going up.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 The Hutchinson News, Sept. 13\par \par \uc2 Kansas cuts in education spending:\par \par \uc2 A report produced by the \uc2 Center on Budget and Policy Priorities\uc2  and released this week by the Kansas Center for Economic Growth revealed some concerning statistics for anyone who cares about quality education in Kansas.\par \par \uc2 Specifically, since the 2008 recession, Kansas has cut education spending by 16.5 percent. Only three states have cut education spending more than Kansas -- Alabama, 20.1 percent; Arizona, 17.2 percent; and Oklahoma, 22.8 percent.\par \par \uc2 And when it comes to education spending and quality outcomes for students, these states are not the sort of company Kansas should want to keep.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 U.S. Department of Education\uc2 's National Center of Education Statistics reports that Kansas students outperform students in Alabama, Arizona and Oklahoma in every measured category. And Kansas exceeds the national average assessment scores in all categories except 4th grade writing. It records that remarkable performance for about half the average cost of other states and considerably less than the aforementioned states that have significantly reduced education spending in recent years.\par \par \uc2 Even the \uc2 American Legislative Exchange Council\uc2  -- one of the primary proponents of reduced spending for education -- highlights in its Report Card on American Education that Kansas fares considerably better than Alabama, Arizona or Oklahoma.\par \par \uc2 According to ALEC, Kansas has a 77.5 percent graduation rate, compared to 74.3 percent for Oklahoma, 63 percent for Arizona, and 64.5 percent for Alabama. Likewise, Kansas has a higher percentage of students who perform at a proficient or higher level in both the 4th and 8th grades.\par \par \uc2 "Good schools and an educated workforce foster economic growth, and we are shooting ourselves in the foot by reducing our investment in our schools and students," said Annie McKay, executive director of the Kansas Center for Economic Growth. "These cuts have undermined our ability to educate Kansas' children, and there will be consequences for Kansas' economy."\par \par \uc2 While there can be debate about the most effective methods that can be used to educate Kansas' children and prepare them for a vibrant and successful future, there is no dispute that Kansas' current education system outperforms its peers and does it for less total cost.\par \par \uc2 And there is no question that the path to failure has been mapped out by those few states that have reduced more than Kansas their investment in education.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 The Garden City Telegram, Sept. 12\par \par \uc2 Keep the state's ignition interlock law:\par \par \uc2 It's always disappointing when legislators resist attempts to enact laws intended to keep people safe.\par \par \uc2 Often, such dissenters argue government shouldn't overstep its bounds in requiring certain safety-minded acts, when the opposite is true. Governments do indeed have an obligation to pursue policies that discourage dangerous behavior.\par \par \uc2 With that in mind, it was encouraging to see a law enacted in 2011 in Kansas contribute to a decline in alcohol-related fatalities.\par \par \uc2 Statistics from the \uc2 Kansas Department of Transportation\uc2  show alcohol-related traffic deaths dropping sharply after Kansas joined other states with all-offender ignition interlock legislation.\par \par \uc2 The law requires all Kansans convicted of drunken driving to install ignition interlock systems. Vehicles won't start if the interlock machines detect alcohol on the breath of the driver.\par \par \uc2 Since passage of the new law, the number of drunken-driving deaths in Kansas dropped by more than 30 percent, from 138 in 2010 to 94 in 2012.\par \par \uc2 Before 2011, the Sunflower State reportedly had an average of 116 alcohol-related traffic fatalities between 2000 and 2010. The nation saw alcohol-related fatalities drop during that time, but not Kansas.\par \par \uc2 Mothers Against Drunk Driving helped push for the first-time offender ignition interlock law in Kansas. They pointed to other states that saw fewer alcohol-related crashes, injuries and fatalities after enacting mandatory interlocks for all offenders.\par \par \uc2 While pursuing a proven way to reduce the number of repeat offenders who endanger themselves and others made sense, there's still work to do.\par \par \uc2 One misstep moving forward would be in a failure of the Kansas Legislature to maintain the interlock requirement.\par \par \uc2 A 2015 sunset clause was built into the law. If the clause isn't removed by state lawmakers, ignition interlocks would no longer be required for all offenders who choose to drive drunk.\par \par \uc2 Statistics that show a downward trend in alcohol-related accidents and deaths should lead the Legislature in the next session to eliminate the sunset clause of a law that works and helps save lives.\par \par \uc2 That's not overreach. It's the responsible thing to do.\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Lawrence Journal-World, Sept. 12\par \par \uc2 Lawrence police enforcement is about safety:\par \par \uc2 This is not about picking on college students. It's about making Lawrence a safer place for students -- and everyone else.\par \par \uc2 Since mid-August, Lawrence police have stepped up their enforcement efforts in downtown and other locations that see an increase in activity -- and, in some cases, poor personal decisions or behavior -- at this time of year. Alcohol often is a contributing factor to the misbehavior and illegal activity that the police patrols are trying to curb.\par \par \uc2 From Aug. 14 through the Labor Day weekend, police cited more than 180 people for offenses ranging from possession of alcohol by a minor to using a fake ID. Fourteen people were arrested, including several on charges of driving under the influence. Police talked to one young man who was observed barefoot and inebriated, but let him go on his way after deciding he was capable of getting home without endangering himself or others.\par \par \uc2 In another case, a citation was issued to a pedestrian who crossed the street against the light and yelled at the motorist who was forced to stop to avoid hitting him. This, as any driver will attest, is a scary safety issue. Even when drivers are alert, pedestrians darting into traffic can have tragic results.\par \par \uc2 Police also are around to help people like the young man who was assaulted while walking home and a group of students who allegedly were attacked by a young man brandishing a length of bamboo. No suspect was apprehended in the first assault, but the man with the bamboo was arrested on suspicion of aggravated assault and consuming alcohol in public.\par \par \uc2 The idea behind the stepped-up enforcement is to set some expectations for behavior at the beginning of the school year, but the effort isn't aimed at students alone. They are looking for anyone that is engaging in illegal or dangerous behavior -- sometimes with students as the victims.\par \par \uc2 Kansas University's student body president told the Journal-World he has heard complaints that students are being unfairly stereotyped as irresponsible and that Lawrence is issuing tickets to help pad the city treasury. Police don't ask to see a student ID before they question someone or issue a citation, but the only way to try to change bad behavior is for it to have consequences. Imposing a fine or court costs -- or in the case of DUIs, stiffer penalties -- carries a much stronger message than a warning from a police officer.\par \par \uc2 For the most part, Lawrence police do a good job of balancing punishment and tolerance in a way that's appropriate for a college town. Students shouldn't be targeted, but they also shouldn't be exempt from the laws that are intended to make Lawrence a safer place to live, drive and, yes, party.\par \par \uc2 7\par \par \uc2 Document APRS000020130917e99h0016a\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw35\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal525\pichgoal600

The Associated Press.  All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 CHICAGO (AP) - After their efforts to legalize gay marriage fizzled in Illinois this year, advocates gave their campaign a serious makeover: They called on unions, focused longer-term and recalibrated their message by using personal stories instead of civil rights comparisons.\par \par \uc2 It's a formula picked up from their fellow activists who made Chicago an influential player in the push for immigrant rights.\par \par \uc2 Proponents will try again this fall to push gay marriage legislation through the Illinois Legislature, where they fell a few votes short in a Democrat-dominated state that's been surprisingly resistant. But this time, they're focusing less on lobbying lawmakers and more on priming the environment to make it easier for skittish legislators to cast favorable votes -- taking cues from a movement that brought nearly 500,000 protesters to Chicago streets a few years ago and helped advance "Dream Act" goals this year.\par \par \uc2 "The immigration advocates, they really know how to get it done," said \uc2 Jim Bennett\uc2 , a director for Lambda Legal, a gay rights group that's part of the Illinois Unites for Marriage campaign. "We have a lot to learn from them."\par \par \uc2 While social justice movements often borrow tactics from one another, experts agree the overlap in Illinois stands out among the 13 states that have embraced gay marriage -- particularly in the union connections and emphasizing the development of young, long-term leaders.\par \par \uc2 At the heart of the renewed push is John Kohlhepp, a lobbyist for Illinois' biggest state employee union. He was hired to lead a coalition that since June has grown from three organizations to roughly 50, including other unions, and raised roughly one-quarter of the campaign's $2 million.\par \par \uc2 On the campaign trail, Kohlhepp's energy ripples out to the nearly 20 field organizers who have been distributing leaflets at events this summer, including the State Fair and Chicago's Bud Billiken Parade, the largest African-American parade nationwide. Kohlhepp's cellphone rings constantly with contacts through the \uc2 American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees\uc2  Council 31, from which he has taken a leave. A seasoned lobbyist, he marks time by counting the days to Oct. 22, when legislators return to Springfield.\par \par \uc2 His involvement shows the strongest link yet between unions and the gay marriage campaign, according to Mary Bernstein, a \uc2 University of Connecticut\uc2  sociology professor who tracks social movements. That relationship resonates in labor-friendly Illinois, where immigrant-rights activists and unions made early links that are now hard to separate.\par \par \uc2 Unions, for example, helped Illinois become the first state to challenge the federal e-Verify immigrant worker identification system, and workers' groups have pushed for fair immigrant wages.\par \par \uc2 Bernstein said the Illinois collaborations appear to be an "innovation."\par \par \uc2 Nationally, the two movements have picked up ideas from one another before. Students without legal immigration status have "come out" in public ceremonies -- Chicago was among the first to hold such events -- and some immigrant activists say they look up to the late Harvey Milk, California's first openly gay elected politician and a renowned organizer.\par \par \uc2 The push for gay marriage in Illinois started in earnest after lawmakers approved civil unions in 2011. But after it passed the Senate, House sponsors ultimately declined to call a vote on the same-sex marriage bill before legislators adjourned in May.\par \par \uc2 Proponents believed they were just a few votes shy, and intense lobbying efforts to find support for the bill were focused on moderate Republicans and black Democrats.\par \par \uc2 But since then, the \uc2 American Civil Liberties Union\uc2  has hired former state Republican Party Chairman Pat Brady, a gay-marriage supporter, to help lobby Republicans. And organizers hope to capitalize on a recent \uc2 U.S. Supreme Court\uc2  decision that invalidated parts of the Defense of Marriage Act and polls showing more public support.\par \par \uc2 "There's really a different story to tell to my colleagues," said Rep. Greg Harris, the main House sponsor.\par \par \uc2 However, the campaign still faces significant obstacles: Illinois conservatives and some religious leaders are equally strong in their opposition.\par \par \uc2 Bishop Lance Davis, of New Zion Covenant Church in the Chicago suburb of Dolton, said his coalition of black churches intends to continue fighting same-sex marriage legislation out of a belief that marriage is between man and a woman. Several of the mega churches the coalition represents are key in voter registration drives and host politicians before Election Day.\par \par \uc2 Davis said he believes the Supreme Court's decision, along with activists trying to bring same-sex marriage, is "a redefinition of the institution of marriage."\par \par \uc2 But other churches have supported the cause, and activists hired an openly gay minister to reach out to more congregations\par \par \uc2 When the push for gay marriage began in Illinois, advocates likened it to the historic struggle for civil rights. That resonated with young people but irked others, particularly blacks. Davis was one of the most vocal critics.\par \par \uc2 This time around, the advocates are putting their focus on family and commitment issues. They are encouraging same-sex couples to relay personal experiences, which was also part of the successful gay-marriage campaigns in Connecticut and Minnesota this year.\par \par \uc2 "The movement has learned what kind of messaging has resonance for people," Bernstein said. "The civil rights discourse has been divisive for a long time ... Everyone understands love and commitment."\par \par \uc2 That includes taking another cue from the immigrant rights movement. In 2006, when Congress considered a bill that would have made being an \uc2 illegal immigrant\uc2  a felony, massive crowds took to the Chicago's streets to protest. Activists told their personal stories of hardship and argued that deportations pull apart families.\par \par \uc2 "What this will take (to win the gay marriage battle) is folks telling their stories," said Keron Blair, who directs campaign field organizers.\par \par \uc2 Ultimately, organizers say, the overarching mission is to inspire leaders who will push for future gay rights issues -- just as a new crop of young activists with roots in Chicago are doing both at home and in Washington D.C.\par \par \uc2 "If we left behind leaders like that, I'd be ecstatic," said Kohlhepp, the union lobbyist now heading the same-sex marriage coalition. He said accomplishing that goal would be "an imprint of the campaign."\par \par \uc2 ------\par \par \uc2 Follow Sophia Tareen at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK
